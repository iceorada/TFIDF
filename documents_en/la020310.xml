<DH>HENDERSON'S SPEAR : A Novel, by Ronald Wright, John
Macrae/Henry Holt:  336 pp. $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D.J. CARLILE</AU>
<BD>D.J. Carlile is a music critic, playwright, poet and
translator of "Rimbaud: The Works," available at Xlibris.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A good mystery operates on several levels at once: It has to have an
intriguing plot, the characters must be varied and believable and the
puzzle or "crime" has to be tied up with no loose ends and no small
finesse by the final chapter. Ronald Wright, in his second novel, has
delivered on all these points with a double-plotted double-decker of
a tale that teases the reader's guesswork right up to the final
revelation.</LD>
<LD>   The mystery begins with the title itself. "Henderson's Spear" is
an heirloom that has dominated the house of the narrator since his
earliest childhood. Its origin and importance are part of the novel's
several structures as a family chronicle disguised as a travel
memoir, as letters from prison, as a mea culpa, a confession.</LD>
<TE>   "Who are you now? And how and what and where? I'm brimming with
questions. I'm ready for the best, the worst, the in-between. Like
most of us you're probably in between." So begins a letter from the
narrator, Olivia Wyvern, a Canadian woman of 38, accused of murder in
Tahiti and writing from her prison cell to the daughter she gave away
at birth. Olivia, or Liv, as she is called, asks the questions that
drive the plot's considerably complex mysteries. There is a second
narrator involved, a bit of a mystery himself, Frank Henderson--the
man of the spear, one of Liv's ancestors--whose Victorian memoir
forms a counterpoint to the main story. He tells of narrow escapes in
colonial Africa; he tells of a long voyage to the South Seas in the
company of Queen Victoria's grandsons, Prince George (later George V)
and Prince Albert Victor (Eddy), the heir to the throne who later
died unexpectedly at 28. The two princes are teenagers at the time of
Henderson's secret memoir.</TE>
<TE>   Liv is in Tahiti searching for her long-lost father, an RAF pilot
who was shot down over Korea and simply disappeared, no body ever
having been found. Her mother spends the rest of her life waiting for
him to return--quite unreasonably, to Liv's mind, until after her
mother's death, when she finds a post-war letter from her father on
the island of Taiohae among her mother's effects. Liv is a
documentary filmmaker, so she dummies up a project on Herman Melville
in Tahiti (based on his book "Typee") to justify heading for the
South Seas in search of her dad or some evidence of his survival.</TE>
<TE>   Melville's brush with cannibalism, the perils of "going native,"
the clash of cultures, the uncertainty of life itself and the
exploitation of the planet are pivotal elements in the tale that
unfolds in these tightly written pages. Liv's family (her mother and
her sister) are sketched in broad strokes, but vividly so; Liv's
lovers, companions and mentors are rather more sympathetically and
fully conveyed so that we come to know them as living, breathing folk
with hidden agendas of their own.</TE>
<TE>   The spear is a powerful totem and appears in the story at
strategic intervals. It is "a great spear more than twice the length
of a man" and, when first observed, has been hanging over the family
mantelpiece for years. "The spear was never taken down, not even when
painters came to exorcise the ghosts imprinted by smoke and time on
the plaster round the fireplace. [T]he blade, shaft, and a small
pommel at the base were made from a single piece of wood. The spear
seemed to belong to a place or time where metals were unknown. Yet
there was nothing primitive about the thing; it was as finely worked
and polished as a piece of furniture, the mere look of it conveying
poise, authority."</TE>
<TE>   When Liv and her sister divide up and sell off the household stuff
left behind by their mother, Liv takes the spear. She also discovers
Frank's secret journals locked in a metal box in the basement. She
takes these with her to Canada. And when she embarks for Tahiti in
search of her father, she takes a copy of the journals with her. She
becomes acquainted with a pair of Greenpeace activists planning a
clandestine voyage to the very island where her father had once
visited, and where perhaps he died or yet may live.</TE>
<TE>   Things go suddenly awry on the short voyage to the Marquesas. The
body of a recently deceased young woman is found floating in the sea,
miles from land, no sign of wreckage or a ship in distress nearby.
"The body had materialized from nothing, a sleeping beauty on the
ocean fields," Liv comments. One of the activists, Natalie, is a
general practitioner and performs a post-mortem. They take
fingerprints from the corpse and, with a brief ceremony, bury the
body at sea. Upon their arrival in the Marquesas, when they report
the incident, they are all arrested on murder charges. Thus, Liv ends
up in prison. And she has the time on her hands to begin to sort
things out.</TE>
<TE>   Did this woman drop out of the sky into the Pacific Ocean? Does a
faded photograph tell more than its possessor knows? What strange
ideas came swarming into the head of Prince Eddy on Tasmania? Who is
the mysterious man referred to in Liv's father's letter ("I have to
find him if I can. Please understand this. I mean him no harm.")? And
why was Frank Henderson asked unsavory questions by a roomful of
ostensible government agents? These mysteries are at the heart of the
novel, and Wright does a masterful job of keeping his reader curious
and puzzled up to the very end.</TE>
<TE>   The book interleaves the two stories, Frank's Victorian journal
and Liv's prison letters, in the manner of a cliffhanger. But we
leave each episode ready to get back to the "other" story, knowing
that it is all intertwined somehow, every development leading us to a
new revelation. Liv is a scrupulous and trusty guide; and her
narrative is spiced with a healthy sense of humor that lightens the
darker aspects of her situation. Her lover Bob writes to her from
Vancouver: "You should see the students I have this term. Not a
kindred soul among them. When I mention Rimbaud they think I mean
Sylvester Stallone."</TE>
<TE>   "Henderson's Spear" serves history and fiction with equal aplomb,
and they are blended as finely as one could wish. This is a
thought-provoking and well-wrought novel whose characters and
situations lodge in the mind and promise further satisfactions at a
second reading.</TE>

<AU>RICHARD ELLIS</AU>
<BD>Richard Ellis is the author of, most recently,
"Aquagenesis: The Origin and Evolution of Life in the Sea."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just about everyone knows Jules Verne, if not through his novels then
from the movies made from them: "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the
Sea" (1954) and "Around the World in Eighty Days" (1956). There were
also movies made of "From the Earth to the Moon" (1958), "Journey to
the Center of the Earth" (1959) and "The Mysterious Island" (1961),
but these were considerably less popular, and Verne was lucky that
his reputation did not have to depend on them. In his day (he was
born in 1828 and died in 1905), Verne was considered a serious
author, whose subject matter often incorporated recent scientific
advances.</LD>
<LD>   When he wrote "Twenty Thousand Leagues" in 1870, the submarine had
just been introduced as a weapon of war, and underwater breathing
devices were in their infancy. Reading Verne's novels as they
appeared must have been as exhilarating an experience as watching men
land on the moon in 1969. But when hasty or sloppy translations
turned the work of a major French novelist into boys' adventure
stories, not unlike those of Edgar Rice Burroughs or H. Rider
Haggard, the English-speaking world was deprived of some of the best
adventure novels ever written.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to his better-known works, Verne wrote a series of
novels that were (in his lifetime) classified as "voyages
extraordinaires" and included "Five Weeks in a Balloon," "Around the
World in Eighty Days," "From the Earth to the Moon" and "The Invasion
of the Sea," which sounds like another bathysphere novel but is
instead about how the sea can be made to invade the Sahara Desert.
Written in 1905 and based on fact (the French really did want to
flood part of the eastern Sahara and turn it into an inland sea),
"The Invasion of the Sea" now appears for the first time in English
with an introduction by Verne scholar Arthur B. Evans.</TE>
<TE>   Like all of Verne's adventure stories, it is filled with
scientific detail that lends verisimilitude to the narrative (if you
want to know how to build a canal to flood a desert, this is the
manual for you), but "The Invasion of the Sea" is also a rollicking
tale of brave French soldiers and engineers, accompanied by their
loyal servants (think of Conseil in "Twenty Thousand Leagues" or
Passepartout in "Around the World"), who face searing heat,
sandstorms, quicksand and, of course, treacherous Tuaregs. The
villains of the novel are the poor nomads who object to having their
ancestral homeland flooded, but their dastardly nature--the "fearsome
natives" are described as "thieves by nature and pirates by
instinct"--is so characteristic of the lower orders of humankind that
one is happy to see the otherwise empty desert turned into another
French Riviera. Verne accepted unquestioned the "white man's burden,"
which was to subjugate and improve those who had the misfortune to
live in "uncivilized" parts of the world. Desert dwellers obviously
needed water (whether they wanted it or not), which could be provided
only by clever French engineers.</TE>
<TE>   Verne's novels were popular because they were often rousing
adventure stories with a heavy infusion of science or at least
scientific terminology. We might compare him today to Michael
Crichton, who also has a gift for storytelling and a knack for
weaving science into his novels. But just using "science" doesn't
automatically validate his work, nor does it elevate it to a higher
plane of literature. Verne often gets the science wrong. In the
beginning of "Twenty Thousand Leagues," he has Professor Arronax
declaim that the animal that has been sinking all those ships was a
giant narwhal or sea unicorn that "often attains a length of 60
feet." In fact, it wasn't any sort of animal at all but rather
Captain Nemo's Nautilus, and narwhals don't get larger than 16 feet
and, despite the ivory tusk that projects from their mouths, are
perfectly harmless.</TE>
<TE>   But Verne was writing fiction, and there is no rule that says you
have to stick to the facts. Just because 60-foot-long narwhals or
submarine-attacking, man-eating giant squids do not exist, doesn't
mean that an author can't use them in a work of fiction. (Was there
ever a ship-attacking white whale? Or a 25-foot-long white shark that
vindictively attacked everybody in sight?) Weaving science into his
adventure novels made them that much more popular, and Verne's
readers probably wanted to believe everything he told them. The
introduction to "The Invasion of the Sea" contains detailed notes
about how the French planned to go about flooding the Sahara, rather
as Ferdinand de Lesseps dug the Panama Canal, which is to say not
very successfully.</TE>
<TE>   In 2002, a new edition of "The Mysterious Island" was issued by
the Modern Library, translated by Jordan Stump and with an
introduction by Caleb Carr. This novel, originally published in 1875,
is a sequel to "Twenty Thousand Leagues" because Captain Nemo
reappears, but Arronax, Conseil and Ned Land have been replaced by
five escapees from a Confederate prison camp in Richmond, Va., who
manage to ride in a balloon--how Verne loved balloons!--all the way
across North America before landing on the mysterious South Pacific
island of the title. (We know it is near Australia, because they
encounter kangaroos, a koala and an echidna, a sort of spiny
marsupial anteater, which they boil up for a tasty stew). They
undergo a succession of life-threatening adventures (an attack by a
troop of orangutans, an invasion of escaped convicts, the dog-eating
dugong) but their pluck and fortitude, not to mention the indomitable
Captain Nemo, see them through.</TE>
<TE>   Verne was almost preternaturally productive. In addition to his
novels, short stories and essays, he wrote books of geography and
history, including a historical geography of France and the
three-volume "Celebrated Travels and Travelers," which included "The
Exploration of the World," "Great Navigators of the Eighteenth
Century" and "Great Explorers and Navigators of the Nineteenth
Century." Anyone who questioned the science or history in his novels
could always refer to his historical interpretations. These histories
are minutely detailed and, as far as I can tell, fairly accurate. But
the novels that I've read, with their hair's-breadth escapes,
man-eating cephalopods, loyal servants, trusty dogs and depraved,
conniving natives (or pirates, convicts, Berbers or whatever), still
suggest Boy's Life adventure tales to me. I'm missing the
intellectual subtleties of the new translations, but when I think of
"Twenty Thousand Leagues," I still think of the giant squid attacking
James Mason aboard the Nautilus or Kirk Douglas playing the guitar to
a sea lion. Verne's stories are, in short, fun.</TE>
<TE>   Although he predicted many things in his novels--including balloon
travel, the helicopter, the electrical engine and interplanetary
travel--it is, I think, safe to say that Verne, a man given to
"scientific" extrapolation, could never have envisioned the Internet.
Instead of the barrage of information now available to us, Verne had
newspapers--it was said that he read 15 every day--and he was a
compulsive taker of notes.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine how this scientist manque would have delighted in the
computer revolution, which has brought us among other delights a Web
site devoted to him (www.jv.gilead.org.il). The site contains the
full text of 17 of his 60 novels (in French, English and Spanish),
frequently asked questions about Verne, a critical analysis of his
work, an Internet mailing list, the Jules Verne virtual library, a
chronology of Verne's life, the complete Verne bibliography, the
Verne virtual bookstore, links to the Societe Jules Verne and
pictures of all 70 Jules Verne stamps, issued not only by France but
also by Hungary, Nicaragua, Upper Volta, Cameroon, Grenada, Mali,
Guinea, Togo, the Cook Islands, Israel and Cuba. The old man would
have loved it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Mysterious Island'</TE>
<TE>   It was nearly eight o'clock when Cyrus Smith and Harbert set foot
on the upper crest of the mountain, at the very summit of the cone.</TE>
<TE>   The darkness was now complete, limiting visibility to no more than
two miles. Did the sea surround this unknown land, or was it joined
in the west to some continent of the Pacific? They still could not
say. A band of clouds lay over the western horizon, heightening the
darkness of the night, and the eye could not determine whether the
meeting of heaven and water was as straight and unbroken there as on
all other sides of the island.</TE>
<TE>   But on that horizon there now appeared a vague gleam, slowly
descending as the cloud climbed toward the zenith.</TE>
<TE>   It was the slender crescent of the moon, soon to disappear from
view. But the meager light it cast afforded a clear glimpse of the
horizon beneath the rising cloud, and the engineer could see its
quivering form briefly reflected on the surface of the water.</TE>
<TE>   Cyrus Smith grasped the boy's hand, and, in a somber voice:</TE>
<TE>   "An island!" he said, just as the lunar crescent sank beneath the
waves.</TE>

<HD>Her Nine Lives</HD>
<DH>SLEEPING WITH CATS: By Marge Piercy, William Morrow:  346
pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NAOMI GLAUBERMAN</AU>
<BD>Naomi Glauberman is an essayist and short story writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cats are the constant. Marge Piercy, feminist, activist and
author of 15 novels, as many volumes of poetry and scores of essays,
has rarely been without the solace of at least one feline companion.
The cats, firmly placed in the emotional center of her memoir,
"Sleeping With Cats," do double duty, opening the doors to
reflections on love, creativity and mortality.</LD>
<LD>   Piercy begins in the present in the Cape Cod home she's shared
with her husband, writer Ira Wood, for the last 20 years. As she
excavates memories, she keeps returning to this cat-filled house with
its exuberant vegetable and flower gardens. These domestic interludes
provide respite from the political and emotional tumult of a life
packed with an ever-shifting cast of husbands, lovers and friends.</LD>
<LD>   At age 65, Piercy has seized this moment to "reflect, reexamine,
make amends and corrections--a sort of High Holidays of the soul in
which I judge what I've done and left undone."</LD>
<TE>   Piercy's poetry has mined these emotions, and her fiction has
grappled with social and political currents, but here she takes a
much more deliberate path, attempting to illuminate the present
through recounting her past. Although she announces that she will
focus her account on her "emotional life, not on literary or
political adventures," the radical politics, feminism and cultural
ferment of the '60s, coupled with her unswerving commitment to her
writing, provide the inextricable backdrop of her tale. Her fierce
ambition to become a writer propels her beyond her rough Detroit
childhood, a world laced with violence, street gangs, racism and
prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1936, she spent her early years in a family still reeling
from the Depression. Her father installed and repaired heavy
machinery for Westinghouse; her mother, a housewife, worked
incessantly to keep their lives together. Although she credits her
mother with introducing her to the joys of language through word
games, neither of her parents understood her dreams: a college
education, a literary life.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lack of familial encouragement, by the age of 15 she
had established the foundations of her future self. "In that year,"
she writes, "I lost one of my best friends to a heroin overdose; my
gentle intelligent cat was poisoned by neighbors because an
Afro-American family was moving into our house; and my grandmother
Hannah, to whom I was very close and who was my religious mentor,
died of stomach cancer. My family moved to a larger house where I had
a room of my own with a door that shut, and I began to write." Years
later, as an activist for civil rights, she realized that her
militant feelings against racism had their roots in the murder of
that cat.</TE>
<TE>   Her reportorial voice, while often fierce and honest, can feel
oddly removed from its subject. Although she brings her unflinching
eye to her loves and marriages, she still seems baffled by her first
brief marriage to a French student, who expected his wild writer
bride to turn into a good Gallic housewife.</TE>
<TE>   Her second marriage in 1960 "opened" in the middle of that decade,
and its twists and turns with numerous partners over the next 10
years were often difficult for Piercy to negotiate. The recounting of
confusion, pain and betrayal in the context of experimentation and
liberation does not make for easy reading.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, after living in New York City for several years, Piercy,
whose work was beginning to be published, moved with her husband to
Cape Cod, as a respite from the factional politics of the collapsing
New Left and for relief from Piercy's often debilitating emphysema.</TE>
<TE>   There, she set up priorities from which she's scarcely wavered.
"One of the things I chose explicitly was to put my writing first.
Everything else in my life waxed and waned, but writing, I discovered
during my restructuring, was my real core. Not any relationship. Not
any love. Not any person."</TE>
<TE>   Ex-husbands and old friends might fret over their
characterizations, but Piercy is no softer on herself. "In the best
of times I am not an easy woman to get along with, but when someone
is estranged from me, I can be annoying indeed. Everything about me
seems too much, too fast, too sure, too loud."</TE>
<TE>   Though she ultimately reconciled with her mother, her relationship
with her father remained distant and difficult to the end. She is
emphatic about not confusing familial obligations with affection: "In
the retirement community facility, they imagined I adored my father
because I fought them to accede to his wishes. Nonsense. I wasn't
going to put up with him, so they were going to have to."</TE>
<TE>   Writing about her cats, these limits dissolve; her prose expands
and relaxes. As she sifts through the past, she sometimes seems
irritated at failures of memory, the errors made, the destructive
trajectory of relationships. In the end, it is the cats, the house,
the present that resonate. The journey she depicts was not always
pleasant; she has little nostalgia for days gone by. And she makes
her case. Like her, the reader is content to return to the aging cats
and writers sharing their lives and love in their house by the sea.</TE>

<LD>DO YOUR EARS HANG LOW?</LD>
<LD>   By Caroline Jayne Church</LD>
<LD>   Scholastic/Chicken House:</LD>
<TE>   32 pp., $15.95</TE>
<TE>   Caroline Jayne Church ("Hungry Hen") pictures two long-eared pups'
playful romp in this reprise of a ridiculously catchy rhyme.
Beginning with the title line, "Do your ears hang low?," a brown
hound strolls up a hill alone. In the next spread, "Do they wobble to
and fro?," a gray-spotted dog approaches from the other direction.
When the dogs see one another, their ribbony ears fly up in surprise
and become tangled ("Can you tie them in a knot?/Can you tie them in
a bow?").</TE>
<TE>   They play a shy game of hide-and-seek to a second verse of "Do
your ears hang high?/Do they reach up to the sky?" Ultimately, a
gatefold opens to show the new friends cheek-to-cheek, shaping a
heart with their plume-like ears. The sequence concludes with
instructions for hand gestures to accompany the song and leaves the

<TE>   THE RECESS QUEEN</TE>
<TE>   By Alexis O'Neill</TE>
<TE>   Illustrated by Laura</TE>
<TE>   Huliska-Beith</TE>
<TE>   Scholastic:</TE>
<TE>   32 pp., $15.95</TE>
<TE>   A schoolyard bully is enlightened by the new kid in class in this
lively story about the power of kindness and friendship. "Mean Jean
was Recess Queen/ and nobody said any different," the tale begins.
Each day at recess, Mean Jean blasts through the playground--and her
cowering classmates--so she can kick, swing and bounce before anyone
else. No one dares cross her path: "She'd push 'em and smoosh 'em,
lollapaloosh 'em."</TE>
<TE>   But when tiny Katie Sue, a new student, arrives, all bets are off.
Unaware of the playground hierarchy, the new girl enthusiastically
kicks, swings and bounces before the "Recess Queen" gets the chance.
Her role usurped, Mean Jean moves toward a meltdown until Katie Sue
makes her an offer she finds difficult to refuse: an invitation to
play together.</TE>
<TE>   Alexis O'Neill's ("Loud Emily") text brims with fun-to-say phrases
that fit a rollicking rhythm, and her assessment of recess dynamics
feels authentic. Laura Huliska-Beith's ("The Book of Bad Ideas")
memorable Jean busts out of the pages, all sneer, bluster and
freckles. Swirling perspectives in the gouache-and-collage artwork
provide a sense of movement and largess. And humorous details, such
as steam coming from Mean Jean's ears or her bouncing another child
like a ball, playfully convey the underlying drama of the situation.

<TE>   A Book of Poems</TE>
<TE>   By Charlotte Zolotow</TE>
<TE>   Illustrated by Erik Blegvad</TE>
<TE>   HarperCollins:</TE>
<TE>   64 pp., $14.95</TE>
<TE>   Looking through this reassuring beginning reader is like taking a
nostalgic stroll through a miniature Norman Rockwell painting. The
quiet poems and etched pen-and-ink drawings from this team,
previously paired for "I Like to Be Little," seem vaguely
familiar--children huddle in yellow raincoats under an umbrella, ride
bareback on a brown farm horse or watch stars on the porch of a
Victorian house. The images hark back to an uncomplicated childhood
in which mothers hang out the wash on a windy day and desks have no
computers.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte Zolotow filters each poem through the lens of a child's
sense of wonder, as she describes a cat as "a furry purry
lovely/mystery" or the "special kind of quiet" that accompanies the
first snow of the season. The tranquil simplicity of the verses is
particularly suitable for struggling new readers.</TE>
<TE>   The poet captures the ineffable promise of things to come in "The
Crickets" that "fill the night/with their voices--/It is like/a
message/in another language/spoken to a part/of me/who
hasn't/happened yet." Loosely organized around the seasons, the book
is liberally plumped up with everyday poems about birthdays, anger,
grown-ups, parents and more. Erik Blegvad's landscapes gleam with the
colors of the seasons and provide an ideal accompaniment for
Zolotow's gentle, comforting verses. (Ages 4-8)</TE>

<TE>   EMILY DICKINSON'S LETTERS TO THE WORLD</TE>
<TE>   By Jeanette Winter</TE>
<TE>   Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux/Foster:</TE>
<TE>   40 pp., $16</TE>
<TE>   "My sister Emily was buried today," begins this wisp of a picture
book, part thumbnail biography and part miniature poetry anthology.
For the next several pages, a mournful Lavinia reminisces about her
reclusive sister ("Emily never went anywhere. Townsfolk thought her
strange"), roots through her dresser ("Here are the dresses she
wore--only white--in summer and winter") and ultimately discovers a
cache of poems ("There must be hundreds!").</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of the book offers a selection of Dickinson's
best-known and perhaps most approachable work, beginning with "This
is my letter to the World/That never wrote to Me--" and including
"There is no Frigate like a Book/To take us Lands away" and "I'm
Nobody! Who are you?/Are you--Nobody--Too?" Verses about nature
predominate ("A Spider sewed at Night/Without a Light/Upon an Arc of
White"), but Jeanette Winter does not shy away from more metaphysical
themes ("Exultation is the going/Of an inland soul to sea,/Past the
houses--past the headlands--/Into deep Eternity--").</TE>
<TE>   With her trademark folk-art style, Winter demurely dresses the
pages in shades of lavenders, periwinkle and soft green. The scanty
biographical information may leave the curious wanting more, but this
is nevertheless a visually pleasing introduction to Dickinson and her
work. Pair this with Elizabeth Spires' "The Mouse of Amherst" for a
more complete picture of the poet. (Ages 5 and older)</TE>

<HD>The End of Innocence</HD>
<DH>ATONEMENT: A Novel, By Ian McEwan, Nan A. Talese /
Doubleday: 358 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAPHNE MERKIN</AU>
<BD>Daphne Merkin is the author of a novel, "Enchantment,"
and a collection of essays, "Dreaming of Hitler."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For decades now Americans have been on the lookout for the Great
American Novel, a work of fiction that captures the essential truths
about the way we live now. We elevate one writer after another--first
Don DeLillo, then Jonathan Franzen--in the belief that the American
sensibility is the best lens for viewing the human condition in the
20th century, or the 21st century for that matter. Yet such a thought
only reveals the brazen Yankee conviction that we are the center of
the world.</LD>
<LD>   Novelist Ian McEwan makes quite clear just how foolish this
assumption is, having written in "Atonement" what might be called the
Great British Novel, a book that invites us to look at the
particulars of modern English history and the cataclysmic changes
that have, willy-nilly, shaken up our Western notion about the
inviolable nature of cultural norms. What he has to say about social
bonds, familial allegiance, uncensored libido and base aggression
leads the reader to an empathic perspective that extends well beyond
his immediate shores.</LD>
<TE>   I suppose if anyone was going to aim this high, it is not
surprising that it should turn out to be Mc- Ewan, whose prolific
literary gifts have been evident from the beginning. Already with his
first novel, "The Cement Garden," in which he depicted the gradual
descent into a "Lord of the Flies"-like primitivism of four orphaned
children who have buried their mother's corpse in the cellar, he
demonstrated his ability to fuse the most attenuated of psychological
observations with a gripping and fast-paced plot.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 25 years, McEwan went on to publish a stream of
stories and novels, most of which were suffused with a casually
Gothic atmosphere that dealt with intimations of evil in the
everyday. "The Comfort of Strangers" (which was short-listed for the
Booker Prize in 1981) moves smoothly from tender sunlit moments to
bone-chilling encounters as a young couple sightseeing in Venice is
lured into lethal erotic games, while "Black Dogs" considers "the
hollow feeling of unbelonging" in a world haunted by the cruel
ideologies of Europe's recent past.</TE>
<TE>   Although McEwan quickly carved out a distinctive terrain--he was
once known as Ian Macabre because of his fascination with the deviant
impulses that exist alongside civilized ones--his sensibility has
always been hard to place, much less to predict. This is attributable
both to the range of his interests (which include a more than passing
acquaintance with science and music) and to the suppleness of his
prose (which fluctuates between an almost clinical bluntness and a
poetic allusiveness).</TE>
<TE>   The two novels that preceded "Atonement," for instance, are as
different in tone and subject as might be expected to come out of the
imagination of one author. "Enduring Love" (1997), a mesmerizing
account of a pathological obsession which occurs as a result of a
freak ballooning accident, is the most accomplished of McEwan's
novels until now. But as befits the impenetrable logic of
prize-giving, it was his next novel, "Amsterdam" (1998), a
lightweight farce that throws a wrench into the oleaginous
contentment of two successful middle-aged men, that won the Booker
Prize several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Atonement," also short-listed for the Booker Prize, is a work of
vaulting ambition which just also happens to be a page-turner. I sat
down to read it late one night and didn't look up for the next three
hours, until the cramp in my neck became too strong to ignore; after
that, I found myself deliberately slowing my pace so as to make the
experience of reading it last longer.</TE>
<TE>   The novel is shaped like an uneven triptych, whose three parts
artfully jump-cut across 60 years of recent history. The first and
longest section unfolds in its minutely detailed entirety on a hot
summer day in 1935; the second is set during the British trek through
Northern France en route to Dunkirk and in a military hospital; and
the third is told in the first person by an elderly, much-acclaimed
writer in contemporary London on the eve of her birthday celebration.</TE>
<TE>   The opening section introduces us to the novel's unsuspecting
protagonist, a precocious and solitary 13-year-old living in a grand
"baronial-Gothic" country house. Briony Tallis is "the sort of girl
who lived in her thoughts," and she commits her fantasies to paper as
she aspires to win the admiration of the distracted adults around
her: a semi-invalid mother, a father who is kept busy in London by
his job in the Ministry and by his mistress, as well as two adored
older siblings. The result of her efforts is a play called "The
Trials of Arabella," which she hopes to stage with the help of a trio
of cousins who have come to stay with her family because of their
parents' impending divorce. When one of the cousins accuses the
willful Briony of "showing off," she is in happy agreement: "This was
precisely why she loved plays, or hers at least; everyone would adore
her."</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone, as it turns out, dances to Briony's tune (or, as
she sees it, the "good sense" which informs her directorial vision),
at least not Robbie Turner, the charlady's son, who has been put
through Cambridge by Briony's father and is on a theoretically equal
footing with her family. Although Briony is "possessed by a desire to
have the world thus so," the world outside her imagination is
distressingly hard to read: "This was not a fairy tale, this was the
... adult world in which frogs did not address princesses, and the
only messages were the ones that people sent." Her spurned romantic
feelings toward Robbie and artistic hubris lead the young girl to
misconstrue a real-life scene of passion between him and her older
sister, Cecilia, which results in Briony's making false allegations.
(Whether she does so inadvertently or deliberately remains open to
interpretation.)</TE>
<TE>   The tragic repercussions--Robbie is imprisoned for a rape he did
not commit; Cecilia breaks off with her family--continue to play out
for years. Robbie, freed from prison, is caught on the gory
battlefields of World War II (this section of the novel bears the
marks of intensive research, which McEwan uses to extraordinarily
vivid effect), and Briony attempts to atone for the damage she has
wreaked by caring for the wounded and dying after the retreat from
Dunkirk.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, though, Briony, who has gone on to become a writer,
attempts to salvage this dark tale by retelling it again and again
and, in the end, by giving it the benefit of her magisterial and
forgiving embrace. She defends her creative license, as self-serving
as it may be, on the grounds that she is offering hope to the reader.
"Who would want to believe that the young lovers never met again,
never fulfilled their love?" she muses to herself the day after her
birthday celebration, in the last pages of the book. "Who would want
to believe that, except in the service of the bleakest realism?"</TE>
<TE>   The canvas of "Atonement" is stretched wider than in McEwan's
previous works, and its elaborate interweaving lends a new depth to
his voice (which has sometimes verged on the facile) without
sacrificing any of its characteristic propulsive energy. The novel
teems with musings on the unforeseen quirks of causality, the
multiplicity of selves that reside within a single character and the
writerly desire to wring a coherent fiction out of the chaos of
reality. It also, not insignificantly, contains one of the more
erotically charged scenes I've read. There is something remarkably
elastic and unegotistical about McEwan's approach to fiction; one
feels that he has less need to assert his sovereignty over his
material than to take the measure of whatever situation he chooses to
write about.</TE>
<TE>   To this end, "Atonement" bears traces of many literary influences
(Jane Austen, E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf and Elizabeth Bowen) and
wears many hats, reading by turns like a traditional Forsythean saga,
a postmodern narrative and a romantic thriller. The double-barreled
ending, which seems--and it's a mere quibble--one virtuosic gesture
too many, puts me in mind of John Fowles' "The French Lieutenant's
Woman." Finally, though, "Atonement" puts me in mind of what made me
an avid reader in the first place, before I lost that original sense
of exhilaration. In the seriousness of its intentions and the dazzle
of its language, it made me starry-eyed all over again on behalf of
literature's humanizing possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Atonement'</TE>
<TE>   Trapped between the urge to write a simple diary account of her
day's experiences and the ambition to make something greater of them
that would be polished, self-contained and obscure, she sat for many
minutes frowning at her sheet of paper and its infantile quotation
and did not write another word. Actions she thought she could
describe well enough, and she had the hang of dialogue. She could do
the woods in winter, and the grimness of a castle wall. But how to do
feelings? All very well to write, She felt sad, or describe what a
sad person might do, but what of sadness itself, how was that put
across so it could be felt in all its lowering immediacy? Even harder
was the threat, or the confusion of feeling contradictory things. Pen
in hand, she stared across the room toward her hard-faced dolls, the
estranged companions of a childhood she considered closed. It was a
chilly sensation, growing up.</TE>

<DH>MY FATHER'S KEEPER: Children of Nazi Leaders--An Intimate
History of Damage and Denial, By Stephan and Norbert Lebert,
Translated from the German by Julian Evans,  Little, Brown: 244 pp.
$25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SABINE REICHEL</AU>
<BD>Sabine Reichel is the author of "What Did You Do in the
War, Daddy?: Growing Up German" and of the forthcoming "The Bad Girl
Bible: How to Be Good at Being Bad."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"You never escape from your parents, whoever they are," says Martin
Bormann Jr., who has the spine-chilling misfortune of having had
Adolf Hitler for a godfather. As becomes clear in the disturbing
book, "My Father's Keeper" by Stephan and Norbert Lebert, Uncle
Adolf, who patted children's heads between invasions and mass murder,
was quite popular among his close circle of friends, especially among
their children. These children, now folks in their early 60s who
still have a soft spot for the grand old Fuhrer, are the subjects of
Stephan Lebert's interviews.</LD>
<TE>   It is certainly interesting how the collaboration on "My Father's
Keeper" came about. Here, again, two pivotal German generations
struggle in their own way to get a grip on the past. Stephan Lebert's
father, liberal journalist Norbert Lebert, a former Hitler Youth,
started to interview children of the Nazi elite in 1959 but didn't
know what to do with the material. Interest in the Nazi past was
nonexistent in the immediate postwar years. After Norbert Lebert's
death, his son, also a journalist, inherited the files and continued
in 2000 with the interviews where his father had left off. Stephan
Lebert looked up former Nazi children, including Wolf-Rudiger Hess,
Niklas Frank and Bormann, and started his uncertain journey into
dangerous territory. It turned out to be an utterly depressing and
alarming experience for the author--and it could be for the reader as
well.</TE>
<TE>   The fathers of these unfortunate sons and daughters were the elite
of the Third Reich, a cabinet of sinister figures that became the
epitome of evil: Martin Bormann, Hitler's secretary; Rudolf Hess,
Hitler's deputy; Hermann Goering, Reichsmarshall and head of the
Luftwaffe; Baldur von Schirach, head of the Hitler Youth; Heinrich
Himmler, Reichsfuhrer-SS; and Hans Frank, general governor of
occupied Poland.</TE>
<TE>   Having been a child or teenager in the last years of World War II,
not to mention having the "Nazis' finest" as fathers, is an
unimaginable experience for most. The early childhood stories of the
group (the best part of the book) are defined by tragedy and upheaval
after the glorious Third Reich crumbled. They were shoved into
displaced persons camps while their beloved fathers, suddenly
infamous war criminals, awaited trial in Nuremberg. Later, as
grown-ups, their offspring struggled in a new world where the
familiar old values were buried under the shiny, newly rebuilt
Germany, where prosperity and amnesia reigned.</TE>
<TE>   Although Klaus von Schirach, a lawyer, says he isn't happy because
modern Germany is much too undisciplined and "Americanized,"
Wolf-Rudiger Hess, an engineer, full-time Nazi and part-time crackpot
"investigator" who thinks the Holocaust was invented (and even if it
wasn't, it was probably well-deserved), still has the dogged ambition
to prove to the world his "innocent" father's rectitude--an annoying
obsession he shares with most other children of Nazis in this book.
Hess Jr., whose own son was born on Hitler's birthday (and is now old
enough to have a home page about his grandfather on the Internet),
even wrote a Rudolf Hess biography titled "I Have No Regrets," which
sums up all of the Nazi leaders' sentiments and last words before
they died.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, two of the formerly interviewed Nazi children
didn't want to talk with the author, and they are the only daughters
in the book: Gudrun Himmler and Edda Goering, each once her Daddy's
favorite girl. Himmler, the still-proud daughter of one of the most
vicious Nazi criminals, is another case of someone suffering from
stubborn delusion. Still busy with clearing "the good name" of the
Reichsfuhrer-SS, she is said to be a bitter, unpopular shrew who
supports and meets with old SS officers and still talks about the
"good old times." And they must have been practically pastoral
because, when the 15-year-old Gudrun in 1945 was asked whether she
had ever been to a concentration camp, she said that she had been to
a certain Dachau to visit Dad, who showed her a nice herb garden and
explained the different kinds of plants. There is no greater chilling
moment in this book.</TE>
<TE>   Goering, a once fancy, rich and rather spoiled young woman (who as
a child was showered with an original Lucas Cranach and other stolen
paintings as presents), has no problem with the family name either.
There is certainly no connection for her between the name of Goering
and genocide. But Goering, now 62, doesn't want to talk about it
anymore. In 1986, she gave a lengthy interview and stated that she
still felt "bound to my parents by a great love" and still marveled
at her "wonderful childhood." And while Jewish children were gassed
and shoved into ovens, she just couldn't get over that darling Uncle
Adolf, who always had licorice stashed for her in his desk drawer
(probably next to the order to invade another country). All of which
could lead to the conclusion that either the Nazi criminals were
schizophrenic or that bad people make good parents and uncles.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, there are two sons, Niklas Frank, a journalist, and
Bormann, a pastor, who comprehend the scope of their fathers' crimes
and don't try to whitewash them. In fact, only Frank stands out as a
highly critical, understandably outraged and deeply ashamed German of
that generation (of which there are many in Germany, though not in
this book) who tore the burden of guilt and shame to shreds and
confronted his father's substantial sins. He wrote a violently angry
book in the 1980s about his arrogant, murderous and completely
unrepentant father and his hatred for him. It caused a sensation,
appalling and incensing most German readers, who had little sympathy
for a disrespectful, ranting "disobedient" son. The reasoning behind
the reaction is that you have to love and honor your father, even if
he had personally helped to wipe out the Warsaw Ghetto. It might be a
noble notion to exempt your own kin from what otherwise would be
contempt, but can it actually be done without fabricating excuses
that might not really hold up under scrutiny? How does one come to
terms with a caring, friendly Vati who teaches you soccer and math
but finds the "final solution" a pretty decent idea? Can one?</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to find sympathy for these not very likable characters
but, before passing judgment and wondering about the postwar insights
of the Germans, we shouldn't forget: They were children. They had
fathers whom they didn't choose. However, where the guilt of the
offspring and the anger of the reader set in is 50 years later, when
Edda, Gudrun, Wolf-Rudiger et al. still hold up the Nazi ideology of
their fathers as a brilliant but misunderstood humanitarian idea that
is sorely missed today. Nowhere in the book do these sons and
daughters mention carnage, Jews, the Holocaust and the horror of the
war orchestrated and carried out by their fathers' and their mothers'
stalwart support of the Nazi regime. So, near the end, when the weary
author admits that he's not heartbroken about Edda's refusal to talk
to him, many readers might also feel relieved.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways "My Father's Keeper" is rather uneventful because, as
Robert von Schirach, son of the head of the Hitler Youth, had warned
the author: "You should know that we Nazi children are completely
uninteresting." It doesn't help that Lebert projects a certain lack
of passion and has no original voice. He seems to want to do his duty
and tries to be thoughtful, fair and not step on anybody's toes. He
certainly raises some important issues and often asks the right
questions but there aren't many daring observations or a provocative
thesis behind all that carefulness. Maybe he was too much of a
dutiful son by continuing his father's worthwhile interviews,
something that might have been limiting instead of liberating.</TE>
<TE>   As irritating as the content of this book is, it's nothing
compared with the puzzling translation (by Julian Evans) that sounds
as if Colonel Klink of "Hogan's Heroes" has composed it in his spare
time while drinking schnapps. There is ponderous embarrassment like,
"The perpetrators. As though they had been swallowed up by the mist
of horror that was sprayed collectively over the dark years." There
are "coffee mornings," a teenager "puts on puppy fat," someone gets
"only kind of empty husks of words" or "replies in a couple of dusty
lines." What and especially why things got lost in translation is
anybody's guess, but maybe this is a deliberate attempt at a klutzy
Germanic touch.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, there is something profoundly sad and pathetic about
these lost souls. But one dares to admit what others maybe feel only
once in a great while. Frank rather courageously says, "I'm sure I've
hated my father so very much because I kept on finding him in
myself." The search for absent fathers is probably the same
everywhere--but nowhere else in the world do you have a generation of
parents that left bloodied jackboot tracks like the original
burghers, bystanders and perpetrators of the Third Reich. Again and
again one is reminded that the sins of the fathers (and mothers)
indeed keep crashing down on the innocent offspring, who are often
maimed for life.</TE>

<LD>WRITINGS ON IRISH FOLKLORE, LEGEND AND MYTH</LD>
<LD>   By W.B. Yeats</LD>
<LD>   Penguin: 458 pages, $13 paper</LD>
<TE>   Look upon "Writings on Irish Folklore, Legend and Myth" as a
chance to cross the divide--with William Butler Yeats as your
guide--between disbelief (a world of dark nature with no spirits) and
the universe of fairy folk and lore that the poet spent his life
studying. If you read no other book than this all year, you will at
least have read one that gives you enough to think about for a
lifetime. It is only a collection, a smattering of pieces written by
Yeats on "the gentry" (fairy folk) and the stories told about them
throughout Ireland but mainly in his home county, Sligo.</TE>
<TE>   Yeats was born in 1865 and lived most of his life in London. He
died in France in 1939. He wrote all his life about folklore, in
newspapers such as the National Observer and the Scots Observer and
journals such as Leisure Hour and the Irish Theosophist. Several
pieces from those publications are included here, as well as
introductions from his own books, including "The Celtic Twilight,"
and books of friends. He studied magic, and several of his own
communications with the fairy kingdom and with the dead are included
here. He records stories of fairy doctors and witch doctors, mostly
from Sligo, with its highly respected fairy strongholds, Drumcliff,
Drumahair and Ballisdare.</TE>
<TE>   The pieces were collected in 1993 by Robert Welch of the
University of Ulster, Coleraine, who had already written several
books on Yeats and Irish literature. We all should have read Yeats'
work on magic and fairies, in books like "The Celtic Twilight" (1893)
early in our educations, but most of us alive today were too busy
learning how to be good empiricists or how to fight communism. We
broke with the spirits of nature, but Yeats gives them the shape and
vigor of divinities.</TE>
<TE>   Because his writing is so clear and breezy, we are emboldened,
reading Yeats, to cry out for what we know by instinct to be true:
There is more to the world than what we see! "The various collectors
of Irish folklore," Yeats wrote in 1888 in the introduction to his
collected folk tales, "have one great merit ... and one great fault.
They have made their work literature rather than science.... To be
considered scientists they should have tabulated all their tales in
forms like grocers' bills--item the fairy king, item the queen." All
of literature--Shakespeare, Dante, Blake and the rest--owe their
inspiration to this folk lore, Yeats repeats throughout: "Imagination
is God in the world of art, and may well desire to have us come to an
issue with the atheists who would make us naught but 'realists.'
Folk-lore is at once the Bible, the Thirty-nine Articles, and the
Book of Common Prayer, and well-nigh all the great poets have lived
by its light." Nature is the source of imagination. The fairy world
begins us closer to nature.</TE>
<TE>   He deplores the faith-sapping influence of 19th century science
and "solid Saxon" influence over the wild Celtic imagination, as well
as the stereotyping of Celts as soft and imaginative and therefore
inferior. Several British and even Irish writers, such as D.P. Moran,
"found it convenient," writes Welch, "to bracket Yeats with the
purveyors of Celtic Twilight effeminacy," and Yeats responded with
letters to editors written with fury and dignity. He wrote, many
times, that in other countries, like Scotland, the poets had made
"darkness their enemy," while in Ireland, the people had made peace
with their witches and fairies. "In Scotland," he wrote in 1889, "you
are too theological, too gloomy, you have made even the devil
religious."</TE>
<TE>   He distinguishes between cities like Dublin and villages: "It is
far easier to be sensible in cities than in many country places I
could tell you of. When one walks on those grey roads at evening by
the scented elder bushes of the white cottages, watching the faint
mountains gathering the clouds upon their heads, one all too readily
seems to discover, beyond the thin cobweb veil of the senses, those
creatures, the goblins, hurrying from the white square stone door to
the north, or from the Heart Lake in the south."</TE>
<TE>   The one great fault of fairies, he writes, is that they steal
children, otherwise, they are without malice, like "'[f]allen angels
who were not good enough to be saved, nor bad enough to be lost,' say
the peasantry." Fairies have very clear emotions, love or hate,
whereas humans, Yeats writes, are always caught up in mixed emotions,
"an entanglement of moods which makes us old." Fairies are, he
writes, "Nations of gay creatures, having no souls; nothing in their
bright bodies but a mouthful of sweet air."</TE>
<TE>   The further we reach into our imaginations, the more we know
ourselves. Yeats quotes Plato's "Phaedrus": "Am I indeed a wonder
more complicated and swollen with passion than the serpent Typho, or
a creature of a gentler and simplier sort, to whom nature has given a
diviner and lowlier destiny?"</TE>

<LD>10TH GRADE</LD>
<LD>   By Joseph Weisberg</LD>
<LD>   Random House: 260 pp., $23.95</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not writing this for class anyway I'm just writing it. I'll
just give myself an A on it." So writes high-school sophomore Jeremy
Reskin of the fascinating document he calls "10th Grade," a largely
punctuation-free "creative writing" exercise that chronicles his
suburban sentimental education during the era of alligator shirts and
Pink Floyd's "The Wall." "10th Grade" is also the title of this
artful, devourable first novel from Joseph Weisberg, which re-creates
high school with terrifying accuracy as Jeremy gropes his way toward
a semblance of self-hood and a barely passing grade in math. Jeremy's
an odd duck: He plays soccer, but doesn't share the "Jock State of
Mind"; he hangs out with a group of trendy misfits, but he doesn't
wear black or engage in their endless food-court philosophizing. In
fact, Jeremy barely rises above verbal shorthand: "Hey" is his
preferred greeting, and "VTS" his code for "very true statement."
Yet, as a teen diarist, Jeremy reaches near-literate glory, rolling
out hilariously run-on sentences about marijuana etiquette, his
bargain-hunting dad and, most of all, the bodacious glories of Renee
Shopmaker, the new girl in school who, by an act of delicious fate,
sits near him in Spanish. Renee is Laura to Jeremy's Petrarch, and
Weisberg makes sure that we jaded adults feel a twinge of longing
every time this unobtainable Charlie's Angel passes Jeremy in the
hall. Weisberg resists curdling this sweet tale with irony and
condescension, and he never allows Jeremy to scorn his clueless
contemporaries. Like his teenage alter ego, Weisberg deserves an A.</TE>

<TE>   TESTIMONY OF AN IRISH SLAVE GIRL</TE>
<TE>   By Kate McCafferty</TE>
<TE>   Viking: 210 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   In the 17th century, periodic slave revolts--led by bondsmen and
women from West Africa--rocked the colony of Barbados. These
uprisings were abetted, much to the alarm of the English overlords,
by Irish indentured laborers, virtual slaves who lived and worked
alongside the Africans in the Bajan cane fields. Kate McCafferty's
debut is an acute examination of this hidden chapter of the New World
and the surprising truths attached to it: that indentured servitude
was, in effect, slavery; that the English kidnapped and enslaved
Irish Catholics; and that Irish and black slaves cooperated in their
daily toils and shared eye-opening cross-cultural experiences. In
time, they rose up together against their masters, and, as in the
case of McCafferty's heroine, Cot Quashey, formed families. After the
most recent failed uprising, Cot, now middle-aged, is hauled in for
interrogation by Peter Coote, a bureaucrat mostly concerned with the
condition of his frilly cuffs. Coote gets more than he bargains for,
as Cot tells of her abduction from the streets of Galway, her long
years in Barbados and her eventual love for Quashey, a Muslim slave
dedicated to Jihad. Cot's rambling testimony makes Coote, by turns,
impatient and sympathetic. Despite all the riveting multicultural
history unveiled here, the reader, too, occasionally echoes Coote's
interjections to get on with it. Still, McCafferty's imagined oral
record is convincing--a harrowing tall tale about events too long
ignored by textbooks.</TE>

<TE>   IT'S HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   By Jimmy Gleacher</TE>
<TE>   Scribner: 256 pp., $23</TE>
<TE>   Jack, the narrator of Jimmy Gleacher's debut, is 26 and sells
advertising in Boulder, Colo. Unlike many fictional twentysomethings,
Jack isn't logging hours on the dating treadmill or wasting time in a
soulless cubicle or caught up in a murderous plot. Maybe he should
be, because Gleacher's plans for Jack are infinitely more
complicated, even as the surface of this heartfelt genial comedy
retains its deceptive simplicity and shrink-wrapped gloss. Jack,
tender sprout though he be, is married, actually enjoys his job, and
the only thing threatening his health seems to be his own nagging
insecurity. But soon enough we find that Jack's marriage--to a
thoroughly out-there rich girl named Hope--is a nightmare, that his
job isn't nearly up to his wife's standards and that a mysterious
graffiti artist is scribbling threatening messages on the windows of
his favorite deli. With chapter headings that resemble a family
board-game closet ("Concentration," "Boggle," "Twister,"
"Battleship"), the book continually reminds us that Jack is trying to
suss out the rules of life. Yet, most often, it is Jack who is being
played, as Hope gets him mixed up in a scheme to sell fruit-flavored
beer, convinces him that he should be a writer, reiterates how much
her mother hates him and eventually orders him to leave. What saves
"It's How You Play the Game" from being formulaic guy fiction is that
Gleacher isn't content merely to show us the game. Rather, he homes
in on the players' strategies and bluffs and doubts: the relentless
and, in Gleacher's views, ultimately necessary, gamesmanship of love,
class and self.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SCHICKEL</AU>
<BD>Richard Schickel is the author of "Matinee Idylls" and
reviews movies for Time magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I was from the beginning thinking: I want John Huston's career,"
Steven Soderbergh said four years ago. "I want a lot of movies over a
long period of time. And then we'll go back, if we want to--I don't
want to, but somebody else can--and sort it all out...."</LD>
<LD>   It seems the smart young director may, if he stays a long course,
realize his wish. His career is only 13 years old, but it already
demonstrates Hustonian range. His films have been small and intimate,
large and bustling; they have been memoiristic, moralistic,
melodramatic, comedic, and they have been slippery stylistically. It
is impossible to find in them a readily identifiable personal manner
because, like Huston, Soderbergh slyly adapts himself to his
material, instead of the other way around.</LD>
<LD>   These thoughts on seemingly disparate talents are occasioned by a
felicitous coincidence, the appearance, in the same month, of volumes
about Huston and Soderbergh in the admirable "Interviews" series,
published by the University Press of Mississippi. There are 20 of
these valuable little books, with more on the way. Evenly balanced
between old movie masters and Young Turks, they are collections of
interviews the directors granted, through the years, to eager
journalists.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the pieces (generally the least interesting) are
interviews with mainstream reporters, who worked the material into
Sunday articles, usually pegged to the release of new movies. Many
are lengthy question-and-answer passages between the director and
earnest, knowledgeable cinephiles writing for the handful of serious
film journals that are scattered about the world. The interviews are
occasionally repetitive, as beginnings are re-explored or the
director repeatedly retails his handful of key anecdotes and
insights. But that's a small matter--you can always skip
ahead--compared to the larger virtues of these books. Their editors
invite us to what we might call participatory biography. We hear the
director's voice talking about the only thing that legitimizes our
interest in his work. (No women are as yet included in the series.)
Except in their modest introductions, the editors don't exercise the
biographer's obligation to tell us what we ought to think about their
films. Similarly the directors themselves are not allowed the
autobiographer's privilege of retrospective rationalization. The
reader is stuck with what these guys said, more or less on the fly,
in 15 or 20 half-forgotten journalistic encounters, and he is
implicitly encouraged to create his own narrative from this raw
material.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the results can be astonishing, as they are in Gerald
Peary's volume on John Ford. Ford was a notoriously difficult
interview--abrupt, ungiving, often downright hostile to his
interlocutors. In particular, he could not or would not describe the
processes by which he achieved the starkly beautiful imagery with
which he wowed generations of cineastes. Similarly, none of his many
biographers has ever solved the mystery of how this churlish and
alcoholic man achieved the sentimental warmth that animates his
best-loved work. Mostly, they have fallen back on awed, useless
dithyrambs. But reading Peary's book, one comes to a rather different
conclusion. For all the honors that were heaped on Ford, the man was
clearly ashamed of himself: perhaps not for the shifty and
self-aggrandizing way he fictionalized his personal history but
because he remained in his own mind an ignorant and inarticulate
lowbrow, unable to keep up with his knowing questioners and angrily
resentful of their learned ways.</TE>
<TE>   The son of an immigrant Irish saloon keeper, Ford had perhaps a
week of college before drifting west to follow his actor brother into
the movies where, more or less by accident, he became a director in
the days when no particular prestige was attached to that profession.
His success was slow to come, and much of it derived from a natural,
therefore inexplicable, gift for composition, an unerring sense of
exactly where to place his camera for maximum impact. Like most
people who find it easy to do something everyone else finds
difficult, he undervalued that talent. In particular he could not
explain it to those who gathered worshipfully around him (often
enough at a sickbed) seeking his wisdom. He answered their affection
with lies, evasions, dubious generalizations. The drama in many of
these pieces derives in part from the fear that Ford would soon
angrily terminate the talk and send the kids scurrying, in part from
the sense that he would like to respond kindly to their respect but
could not find the words to do so. Yet, paradoxically, I emerged from
this book more sympathetic to Ford than any of his inflated
biographies ever made me. There is something very touching in the
spectacle of this primitive and outrageous old man, so out of touch
with his own work, feelings and audience, groping for some common
ground with the latter, failing to find it and then retreating back
into silence and isolation.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing quite so emotionally raw arises out of the publication of
the Huston and Soderbergh books. But taken together they say
something interesting about the way similar talents manage to prosper
in wildly different Hollywood climates. Huston was a romantic drifter
as a young man--boxer, horseman, slightly feckless charmer--who
eventually settled into screenwriting, then directing. In his
waywardness he was more like Ford's generation than Soderbergh's.
These interviews reveal him as a well-read man who loved to live
large. Indeed, his excuse for making so many bad movies from the
mid-'50s through the early '70s was that his estate in Ireland, with
its 13 full-time servants, kept him hopping. In the eyes of cinema's
purists, his repute will never entirely recover from the likes of
"Sinful Davey" and "The Mackintosh Man," though he himself took a
chipper practical view of them. They served his economic purposes
and, besides, he also made "Fat City" and "The Man Who Would Be King"
in that period.</TE>
<TE>   A serene and genial guide to his own career, he stresses his
unobtrusiveness as a director of both camera and actors. Somewhat
offhandedly he concedes that there may be some truth to the standard
critical take on him: that his best movies are all about doomed
criminal enterprises undertaken by ruefully romanticized outsider
figures who gallantly accept the failure of their plans. There were
enough of them to constitute an authorial obsession, which in his
cool elegant fashion he refused to convert into a grand vision. It's
better, as Soderbergh suggests, to discover large themes after the
fact of a movie than it is to self-consciously pursue them going in.</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh is quite a different character. He shares with Huston a
lack of formal education and a taste for wandering. But he was always
a movie geek, living hand-to-mouth as he made his little amateur
short subjects, trying to break into the movies, which he did
sensationally at 26, with "sex, lies, and videotape," which won the
Palme d'Or at Cannes. The interviews show him to be both
self-conscious and fighting self-consciousness, as he tries to
develop his own cinematic vocabulary. They also show him to be a man
plagued by "the anxiety of influence," something that never bothered
Huston or Ford or any of the old-timers.</TE>
<TE>   How can it be otherwise? We've all, by now, seen too many movies,
absorbed too many influences. People like Soderbergh are obliged to
work in a climate where no one gives a hoot for the movie past and
where directors, having been indulged their "Kafkas" are faced with a
stark choice--remake "Ocean's Eleven" or head back to the margin.</TE>
<TE>   This climate could eventually turn the "Interviews" series into a
dismaying record of early promise blighted. In the meantime, though,
this series is the most provocative cinematic publishing enterprise
now on offer--a seductively readable guide not just to our movie past
but to its future.</TE>

<DH>YOU'RE ONLY AS GOOD AS YOUR NEXT ONE: 100 Great Films, 100
Good Films, and 100 for Which I Should Be Shot, By Mike Medavoy with
Josh Young, Pocket Books: 400 pp., $27</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>Kenneth Turan is The Times' film critic and the author
of the forthcoming book, "Sundance to Sarajevo: Film Festivals and
the World They Made."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More like gods than the stars they deal with, studio executives have
their hands, light or forceful, on a great many projects. As Mike
Medavoy takes pride in pointing out in "You're Only as Good as Your
Next One," although today's directors may make 15 films in a career
and actors perhaps twice that, he has been a factor on about 300
motion pictures.</LD>
<LD>   Though his passion for his own projects is not surprising (most
critics wouldn't agree with him that 100 of his films were great or
that Arnold Schwarzenegger's "The 6th Day" was by any means a
significant piece of work), Medavoy's book is of interest because in
many ways he's not a typical modern studio executive.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Shanghai in 1941, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, he
grew up speaking Spanish in Chile. By the time he got his first
Hollywood job--joining John Badham, Marc Norman and Walter Hill in
the Universal mailroom--he already had more of a cosmopolitan outlook
than most Hollywood executives, picking up "traces of Russian,
Italian and French" along the way.</LD>
<TE>   Partly because of his ability and temperament, partly through good
fortune, Medavoy spent a major chunk of his career (from 1974 to
1990) helping run the atypical class acts of the studio system:
United Artists and its off-shoot, Orion Pictures. "In the four years
I spent at UA," he writes, "the studio won back-to-back-to-back best
picture Oscars for 'Rocky,' 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and
'Annie Hall' and finished number one among all studios at the box
office for two of those four years."</TE>
<TE>   Given this experience, it is not surprising that Medavoy has
written a decent, intelligent book about a business that is often
neither. "You're Only as Good as Your Next One" reads like the kind
of executive he has the reputation for being: determined,
no-nonsense, sure of himself. But, paradoxically, this strictly
business autobiography is at its best and most readable when Medavoy
comes down from the mountaintop and gives in to his irritation with
those he feels have done somebody wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly Medavoy tries--with some success--to pass on the
common-sense wisdom he has learned in his decades in the movie
business, whether it be his standards for a good script or "the three
simple rules of packaging" or his conviction that "maintaining your
equilibrium in this town is hard when you're successful." While all
his points are well taken, there is an earnestness to the way they
are told that keeps them from being compelling.</TE>
<TE>   More interesting are his stories of his time at UA (which he
joined in 1974 as head of West Coast production) and later Orion.
Movie business attitudes have so changed that his tales about the
UA's willingness to take chances on dicey material such as "Network"
and "Coming Home" or about Arthur Krim's theory that "nobody ever
went out of business by giving away profits" seem to come from a
galaxy long ago and far away.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his executive position, Medavoy can relate case
histories of how such films as "Cuckoo's Nest," "Rocky" and "Silence
of the Lambs" came together. His take on the little things that went
wrong is also intriguing: He feels the Orion's penny-wise reluctance
to help commemorate the success of the original "Terminator" by
taking out trade ads and allowing its producers to order a bottle of
vintage Champagne at a celebratory lunch "probably cost Orion nearly
a half billion dollars" in revenue from the loss of the sequel.</TE>
<TE>   "You're Only as Good as Your Next One" is particularly vivid,
however, when Medavoy takes off the gloves for a bit, when he
abandons the avuncular for the acerbic. As the book makes clear,
being treated with decency and respect is critical for Medavoy, and
when he is not, he does not forget all about it.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Rafelson, for instance, is referred to as someone who "gained
a reputation as an abrasive know-it-all," and Michael Cimino, whose
"Heaven's Gate" crippled UA after Medavoy left, is labeled "a
director who could charitably be called a megalomaniac." Medavoy is
especially dismissive of people he feels have tried to rewrite
history. He is irked with Sylvester Stallone for claiming the studio
tried to buy him off "Rocky" and with James Cameron for asserting
that Medavoy had insisted that O.J. Simpson play the Terminator.</TE>
<TE>   The people Medavoy is most angry with are the former Sony Pictures
triumvirate of Peter Guber, Jon Peters and Mark Canton, who he claims
made his life a living hell while he was running Tristar Pictures
after leaving Orion. He describes Guber, among other things, as "a
secretive meddler by nature," is acidic about a tennis bet he says
Canton lost and never paid and pointedly calls the chapter on his
Sony days "The Fish Stinks at the Head." What especially gripes
Medavoy is having aided all three men earlier in their careers: "I
helped load the gun," he says, "that later executed me in public."</TE>
<TE>   Running his own company, called Phoenix Pictures "not for the
Phoenix rising from the ashes but because it is a strong-looking
symbol," Medavoy remains a Hollywood presence at a company whose
success or failure hangs on his own decisions. As he writes, "if the
company fails, it will be because I chose the wrong movies." When he
adds, "even on the worst days, I kind of like that feeling," no
reader of this unapologetic book will doubt him for a minute.</TE>

<HD>That Killer Charm</HD>
<DH>John Lithgow cultivates his duality for a character who
pats backs and stabs them in 'Sweet Smell of Success.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BLAKE GREEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The challenge of J.J. Hunsecker, says John Lithgow, who's playing him
in the new musical "Sweet Smell of Success," "is getting the tone
exactly right." Arrogant, corrupt, megalomaniacal, the powerful
newspaper gossip columnist "should be entertaining, but he's a
horrific character. Making him captivating and then heart-stopping is
tricky business."</LD>
<LD>   For some time now, the tall and balding Lithgow, known
professionally as exceedingly versatile and personally as genial and
thoughtful, has been at work developing this duality.</LD>
<LD>   Smiling, then scowling, back-patting, then stabbing, seducing,
then cruelly scorning--the actor created Hunsecker's character first
in Chicago, where the musical premiered early this year, then in New
York, where it's in previews at Broadway's Martin Beck Theatre and
opening Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Winter visited Chicago more earnestly than it did New York this
year, and on a snowy January morning there, Lithgow was sitting in
his suite at the Four Seasons Hotel musing about the cynical
character he'd chosen to tackle in his first starring vehicle (not
counting the voice of Lord Farquaad in last year's "Shrek") since
playing the daft Dick Solomon in the successful NBC sitcom "3rd Rock
From the Sun" from 1996 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Sweet Smell" is the story of how the ruthless Hunsecker ruins the
lives of three people: fawning publicist Sidney Falco; Hunsecker's
younger sister, of whom he's overprotective; and the self-confident
jazz musician she's fallen in love with. It seemed an intriguing
prospect. But in Chicago the musical received mixed reviews, a blow
to its creators and producers in part because wildly inflated
predictions had it a shoo-in for the Tony Award, this season's "The
Producers"--which was last year's musical-based-on-a-movie, also set
in New York and featuring two show-biz shysters, that also debuted in
the Windy City.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious difference is that "The Producers" is a comedy with a
highly improbable plot and musical interludes already built in;
"Sweet Smell of Success" is a dark, ugly, psychologically
complex--and ultimately fascinating--story that has some basis in
fact. Ernest Lehman, who wrote the 1950 novella on which the 1957
movie is based, had once worked for a movie publicist who supposedly
inspired the character of the sleazy Sidney Falco, J.J.'s sycophantic
item-supplier (played by Brian d'Arcy James).</TE>
<TE>   Some people connected with the musical, including Lithgow, admit
also being influenced by Neal Gabler's biography of Walter Winchell,
a once-ruthless, polemic columnist for the old New York Mirror who'd
gotten his start in vaudeville.</TE>
<TE>   "When I read the book," says Nicholas Hytner, the show's director,
"I really started to see there could be music in this story. That
wonderful, brutal, aggressive assault that Winchell launched on his
readers ... has tremendous theatrical energy."</TE>
<TE>   "You see the engine that drives this character," Lithgow says
about the book. The vaudeville routine he does in "Don't Look Now," a
number in Act 2, is not only derivative of Winchell's life, but
portrays his chameleon character: the jolly personality in the
spotlight and the demanding, overbearing soul inside.</TE>
<TE>   "When the villain is the star, you have to move carefully,"
Lithgow continues, seemingly less concerned with the criticism in
Chicago than some of his anxious associates. Burt Lancaster had
played a brutal, chilling J.J. in the movie, a man seemingly without
a nice bone in his body. In the musical, Lithgow can be a
charmer--but one who turns on a dime.</TE>
<TE>   "A demonic charmer," as Hytner puts it, insisting that "it was
never on our agenda to be faithful to the source. While all
journalists know the movie," he says of complaints that the show has
strayed, "we're playing to 95% houses that haven't ever seen it."</TE>
<TE>   Lithgow says he'd been "captivated" by the project since first
reading John Guare's script, listening to a couple of the songs from
the score by Marvin Hamlisch and Craig Carnelia, and "getting an idea
how the music floats in and out of the story." A workshop in July
2000, during a hiatus before the final season of "3rd Rock," sealed
the deal for him. (And for the producers, who agreed to postpone the
show a year so that the actor could join the cast as the sinister
Hunsecker.)</TE>
<TE>   "This presented itself at just the right time," Lithgow says of
"Sweet Smell." Not only was he new to musicals, the musical was new.
He also looked forward to resuming the villain mantel after years of
comedy. "It's like crop rotation," he says, deftly switching
analogies, "like switching gears."</TE>
<TE>   Even before Lithgow, 56, was offered the part, he'd decided that
the best way to come off a sitcom--which, with its live audience is,
he says, much more akin to being in a play than a movie--would be to
return to the theater. With a Tony for his Broadway debut (1973's
"The Changing Room") and a resume that includes a decade in which he
did a play a year, Lithgow hadn't been on the New York stage since
1988, when he played the sexually hoodwinked French diplomat in "M.
Butterfly" on Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon, an alien-in-human-clothing in "3rd Rock's" somewhat
convoluted plot about a family from outer space that takes up
residence in Ohio, was a broadly comedic figure. But Lithgow has had
plenty of experience playing bad guys in films--as a cartoonish mad
scientist (this time possessed by aliens) in 1984's "The Adventures
of Buckaroo Banzai," Denzel Washington's psychotic nemesis in 1991's
"Ricochet," evil twin brothers in 1992's "Raising Cain" and, notably,
Sylvester Stallone's menacing stalker in 1993's "Cliffhanger."</TE>
<TE>   But for someone who thrives on mixing it up, Lithgow says he was
beginning to tire of this diet, one of the reasons he was delighted
in 1995 to sign on to "3rd Rock," created with him in mind by Terry
and Bonnie Turner, whom he'd met in the '80s when he had been host of
"Saturday Night Live." They wanted someone "who was a cross between
Errol Flynn and Bugs Bunny," he says, repeating the oft-quoted
description. Of all the roles he's played, Lithgow says, "this one
was certainly closest to my id."</TE>
<TE>   "The movie jobs were becoming less and less interesting," he says.
"I'd become known as a penny-dreadful villain and, nothing wrong with
that, but it was beginning to pile up. I thought I should do
something completely different--I'd been ignoring what had been an
ethic of mine: Don't do anything that pigeonholes you." Plus, as the
father of two then-preteens (with his wife, Mary Yaeger, a UCLA
history and economics professor), "I felt I should spend some time at
home. Television is a wonderful job if you have a family." (From his
first marriage, Lithgow also has a son.)</TE>
<TE>   What came out of "3rd Rock" for Lithgow, besides a lot of
"delirious fun" and "the longest steady job I've ever had," was a
recognition that he says "made it possible for me to try other things
because people would let me."</TE>
<TE>   Lying on the coffee table in front of him were galleys of
"Micawber," the actor's third children's book, which will be
published in September. Starring an artistically precocious squirrel,
"it's a child's guide to art and museum-going," he says, proudly
flipping through the pages of text illustrated by C.F. Payne.</TE>
<TE>   He's also recorded two CDs of songs--some original, some obscure
Tin Pan Alley novelty tunes--and performed with symphony orchestras
in concerts for children around the country, displaying a talent he'd
first uncovered when, self-taught on the guitar, he began performing
for his own children's classes. "I'm living out my Danny Kaye
fantasy," he says happily. "Children are an incredible audience. It's
very difficult to keep their attention, but when you do, they're
extraordinarily grateful."</TE>
<TE>   His growing reputation with these concerts was, in fact, the
reason why Hytner says there was no cause for concern that Lithgow
had never before been in a musical. "He's one of the great American
stage actors," the director says, "and it turns out he sings just
fine." (Hytner, a Brit, says he'd seen episodes of "3rd Rock" in
England, although not the one in which Lithgow does a wild parody of
Michael Flatley's "Riverdance.")</TE>
<TE>   "Unwittingly, the concerts for children were great training for
me. I've also taken some lessons, worked with people who know how to
use the voice properly," he reports in a recent conversation in New
York, where the company has been working on "Sweet Smell" for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, the year when the musical is set, Lithgow was only 6,
hardly cognizant of the politics and nightlife culture of an era in
which innuendo, the weapon so deftly wielded by Hunsecker, gave power
to sinister creatures.</TE>
<TE>   Lithgow had, however, already made his stage debut. While hardly
the usual story of a child actor--Lithgow went on to Harvard and
studied on a Fulbright scholarship in England in 1967--he did grow up
playing a variety of small roles in the Shakespearean festivals his
father ran in the Northeast, including at the McCarter Theatre in
Princeton, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "Mine were mostly one-syllable roles," the actor says of those
days: "Nym, Poins, Pinch, Froth. Years later, I finally did a Laertes
in a 'Hamlet' in the park [Central Park]. Now I've outgrown most of
the roles, but I'd love sometime to do 'King Lear'--yet another
Lear," he mocks the aging actor's dream role.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of positioning himself for the stage, Lithgow grew up
intending to become an artist. From the inside, he says, theater life
"looked scary and difficult--we lived in eight, 10 different places
while I was growing up."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a pretty talented painter--big oils, mostly figurative--but
not a very good one," he says. "I have a lot of facility, but I
really stopped at age 19," when he discovered in college theatrical
productions "so much positive reinforcement and a community I loved.
I like the reciprocity of the theater."</TE>
<TE>   Staying on in England after his Fulbright, he says "I was
basically a barnacle on British theater," among other adventures,
coaching English actors, such as Peggy Ashcroft, in American dialect.
In return, "I came home with a British accent," quickly abandoned, he
recalls, after "my sister refused to talk to me because I sounded so
affected."</TE>
<TE>   "To do it well," he returns to the subject of painting, "you have
to do it." Most brushwork that he's accomplished in recent years has
been on movie sets--a diversion from "the waiting around, the torpor"
that he says makes "movies incredibly difficult for me." His
publisher has suggested that he illustrate his next book, "and I'm
gearing up to that."</TE>
<TE>   When Lithgow arrived in New York in 1972, the year Winchell died,
"I met a couple of the old-timers," he says about the gossip
columnists who were once a mainstay of the daily newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "Leonard Lyons, Earl Wilson--they were in the last stages of their
careers; there was something sort of spent, dead about them," he
continues. "I used that image for J.J. at the end."</TE>
<TE>   But he also feels he's borrowed something of "the coldness of
Burt's performance" when Hunsecker is being his most ruthless. "I
like being on a first-name basis with Burt," he says, joking about
"all the time we've been together."</TE>
<TE>   "This really isn't like any other musical I can think of," Lithgow
says.</TE>
<TE>   In its dark mood, "I used to compare it to 'Cabaret,' but that's
more about a global thing. This is the interaction of four people,
one of whom is a killer." But it also, he says, "captures the
exuberance, the exhilaration of New York nightlife" at a time when
columnists went on "nightly crawls."</TE>
<TE>   He has vicariously enjoyed discovering that time as well as
whatever else has come with the show. "I see myself as a tool for the
writers, but I'm also a very vocal, activist actor," Lithgow says. "I
came up with a few bright ideas, although I won't tell you which
ones. And a lot that were ignored." He quotes what he says has become
the cast's "slogan," attributed to his co-star James: "'Revivals are
for cowards.'"</TE>

<DH>Can alt-country's Kasey Chambers build a following in a
market that prefers artists who fit radio formats?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kasey Chambers is the ultimate in cool on the cover of her new album,
"Barricades &amp; Brickwalls." Staring seductively at the camera as she
walks down the street dangling a guitar in hand, she looks like the
maverick love child of Steve Earle and Lucinda Williams.</LD>
<LD>   The Australian singer-songwriter brings the character and
independence of that pairing to the album's defiant title track--a
rowdy, feminist declaration that runs counter to all the helpless
waif songs in pop music.</LD>
<LD>   No matter what obstacles you put in front of her, Chambers vows in
the blistering country-rock tune, she's going to get her way. You can
tie her down on the railroad track and let that freight train loose,
but she still boasts that "I'll be damned if you're not my man/Before
the sun goes down."</LD>
<TE>   Like Williams and Earle, she's part of the alt-country world that
mixes traditional and modern sensibilities, and she's gifted enough
to earn the cheers of critics and her role models.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, the literary-minded songwriter who guests on one track
on "Barricades &amp; Brickwalls," calls Chambers her favorite new artist.
Earle, who is a Nashville rebel in the tradition of Willie and
Waylon, says Chambers is the best female singer he's heard in "a
long, long time."</TE>
<TE>   Critics--in magazines from Rolling Stone to Vanity
Fair--invariably compare Chambers to other great alt-country figures
such as Emmylou Harris and the late Gram Parsons, who inspired the
whole "No Depression" country-rock movement that includes Ryan Adams,
Wilco and the Old 97's.</TE>
<TE>   Like Parsons, Chambers knows country music isn't a straitjacket,
but a form to be manipulated--as the Village Voice's review of
"Barricades" noted.</TE>
<TE>   In the album's "A Little Bit Lonesome," she writes a song in the
classic Hank Williams heartbreak style. It's so authentic you have to
check the album credits to be sure it isn't an old Williams song.
Then she sings Parsons' "Still Feeling Blue" with a spirit that makes
it her own.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers' music, however, isn't just about homage, even if her
vocal tone sometimes seems shaped by the same Southern mountain range
as a young Dolly Parton's. Her "Nullarbor Song" is a sweet,
folk-accented salute to the vast desert region in Australia where she
lived for years; "Falling Into You" and "On a Bad Day" are
confessional country-pop tunes. There's even a rare entry into social
commentary on "Ignorance," a bonus track on the album.</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of musical vision that comes instinctively from
blending musical styles rather than trying to flow with the
commercial currents of the day, and it's an approach that has made
Chambers a major star back home. Both her albums have gone to No. 1
on the pop charts in Australia. She's likely to be a star in this
country too, but on a more limited scale.</TE>
<TE>   In the cold reality of today's record business, there is often a
glass ceiling for artists whose music doesn't fit into one of the
mass radio formats, whose exposure offers the quickest path to the
top of the charts. It's the same barrier that has kept many of
Chambers' influences, from Parsons to Lucinda Williams, from seeing
their commercial success even come close to their critical acclaim.</TE>
<TE>   Will it be any different for Chambers?</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Pollack, one of the nation's leading programming consultants
for radio and television stations, says it's a stiff challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing more frustrating than to see great new artists
run up against this format issue because when you hear someone as
good as Kasey Chambers or Chris Isaak or Lyle Lovett or Ryan Adams,
you want everyone to be able to hear them," he says.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn a lot about how pop stars aren't born equal by
looking at just two nights over the last 18 months at the Roxy in
West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Two gifted young singer-songwriters had industry taste makers on
their feet cheering at separate showcase performances, and both women
went on to become stars. But the vastly different size of the
artists' success says a lot about how the boundaries of stardom vary
depending on your genre of music.</TE>
<TE>   One was Alicia Keys, who was showcased at the Roxy last May with a
musical style that incorporates ideal elements for today' pop
marketplace--sounds, including hip-hop, soul and pop, that are adored
by Top 40 radio programmers. Thanks to that airplay and strategic TV
appearances, Keys' debut album has sold more than 4.5 million copies
in the U.S. and earned her five awards, including best new artist, at
last month's Grammys.</TE>
<TE>   The other was Chambers, who played the club in the summer of 2000.
It was clear that her classic-minded, country-driven style would be
considered too raw and rockish for country stations that lean toward
a slick, pop-minded approach.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers, 25, has become a star in this country only with critics
and the handful of radio stations, including KCRW-FM (89.9) in Santa
Monica, whose playlists are aimed at adventurous listeners. The
result is that her debut album, "The Captain," has sold only about
65,000 copies in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   On an encouraging note, her label, Warner Bros. Records, is
dedicated to finding an audience for the singer. Tom Biery, the
label's senior vice president of promotion, believes there is a song
on "Barricades &amp; Brickwalls" that can get airplay on pop stations.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the song, "Not Pretty Enough," is a statement about
not being accepted by pop radio.</TE>
<TE>   Against a gentle, seductive backing, Chambers sings:</TE>
<TE>   Am I not pretty enough</TE>
<TE>   Is my heart too broken</TE>
<TE>   Do I cry too much</TE>
<TE>   Am I too outspoken</TE>
<TE>   Don't I make you laugh?</TE>
<TE>   About the song, Chambers says, "The frustration in the song is not
being able to hear so many of my favorite artists, from Lucinda to
Matthew Ryan, on the radio.</TE>
<TE>   "The song is asking, 'Why don't you play us?' In asking it, I also
know the answer to all those questions. Yes, we are too outspoken.
Yes, we cry too much. People don't want to hear that intensity on the
radio, and radio stations are afraid if they do play something with
bite, listeners may tune out. But it's that edge that often makes
music worth hearing."</TE>
<TE>   If Chambers ever does defy the odds and make it big in this
country, her story is going to be a media favorite. It's amusing to
picture the frantic race to be the first magazine or TV show to get
footage of Chambers on the Nullarbor, talking about what it was like
living in the desolate region for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   She was just 3 weeks old when her parents put her and her older
brother, Nash, into a Toyota Land Cruiser that became their home
while her dad hunted foxes for a living. Because there was no other
entertainment, young Chambers spent hours listening to tapes of her
guitar-playing father's versions of American country music. Johnny
Cash, Hank Williams and Parsons were among the favorites.</TE>
<TE>   It's a time she captures eloquently in "Nullarbor Song," which
describes the region's late-night isolation: "You can hear the train
on the line/The whistle blows just to break the silence/I wave just
to break the time."</TE>
<TE>   When she was 10, the family returned to Southend, an appropriately
named small town on the southern tip of Australia. The plan was for
Kasey and her brother, who had been tutored only by their mother, to
attend school. But Bill Chambers soon became restless, and the family
began traveling around Australia doing shows in clubs and bars. As
the Dead Ringers, they even made some albums.</TE>
<TE>   The band ended in the early '90s, when her parents separated. By
then it was evident that Kasey was the true talent in the group, and
she started a solo career. Still, it was a family affair. Her dad
plays guitar in her band, and her brother is studio producer.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. is optimistic about moving Chambers to the next
commercial level. Thanks to glowing reviews and word of mouth, the
new album has sold nearly 35,000 copies in three weeks--more than
half of the first album's sales in almost two years.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the stark determination of the song "Barricades &amp;
Brickwalls," Chambers, who is expecting her first child in May,
doesn't seem relentlessly driven to duplicate her Australian success
in this country.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a bonus for me," Chambers said during a recent visit here
to record some songs at the Largo for later broadcast on KCRW and for
a return engagement at the Roxy. "This isn't what pays my rent. I
realize there are so many differences between Australia and America
in terms of population and music styles and radio formats. I'm
thrilled just to be able to spend my life making music.</TE>
<TE>   "The strange thing, though, is I hear people in this country all
the time talking about how terrible music is these days, and I think
to myself, 'Are you crazy?' How can it be terrible when you have
people like Lucinda Williams and Emmylou Harris and Buddy and Julie
Miller making records? When I hear that, I just tell them they may
just be looking for good music in the wrong places."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood's Eternal Riddle</HD>
<DH>As the movie 'Echo Park' so excellently pondered: Are you
an actor, writer or musician if no one is paying you to ply your
trade?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it was a relatively new commute to work that takes me past the
Glendale Freeway interchange labeled "Echo Park" almost daily. Or
maybe it was too many desperate e-mails over the years from
self-described actors and writers, either railing against "the
system" that denies them entry or talking about the next "job" from
which they will derive no income.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe too it was a recent interview with Eriq La Salle, who, after
cashing in fabulously thanks to his role on "ER," said, "The big
secret that a lot of people don't understand about most actors is
that if you are really true artists, you'll do this for free."
Although I have no doubt that is the case for many who have that
luxury, including perhaps La Salle at this stage, it seems a pretty
safe bet that given the choice, most of his brethren would prefer
some tangible compensation.</LD>
<LD>   All these threads lead in the same direction, toward a question I
am no closer to answering today than when I first saw the movie "Echo
Park" at the time of its release in 1986--namely, when is an actor,
writer or musician really an actor, writer or musician, especially if
no one is paying them to ply their trade?</LD>
<TE>   That was, in a nutshell, the underlying theme of "Echo Park," a
gentle, bittersweet film whose title played off its geography by
following the exploits of a group of people living--figuratively and
literally--just outside of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Written by Michael Ventura and directed by Robert Dornhelm, it
holds up quite well, so much so it should almost be required viewing
for anyone who gets off a bus from Poughkeepsie anticipating a date
with stardom.</TE>
<TE>   "Echo Park" has some memorable comments about how to properly
address these aspiring actors and writers, both delivered by Susan
Dey, playing a single mother and sort-of actress who takes a job
stripping to pay the bills.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every character really wants to be doing something else,
including Dey's next-door neighbor, an Austrian bodybuilder-personal
trainer with Schwarzenegger-esque ambitions; and her new roommate, a
pizza-delivery guy/songwriter, portrayed by Tom Hulce, who is too
sheepish and self-critical to discuss his hoped-for career.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if she's an actress, Dey's character muses, "I try to act. I
want to. I go to classes, but is that being an actress? ... If it
isn't, then no, I'm not. I have plans, but does having plans make me
an actress, an artist, whatever?"</TE>
<TE>   Later, Hulce expresses his contempt for those in their shared
predicament: "I am so sick of all of the people in this town who are
poets or screenwriters or actresses, when we're all just delivering
pizzas, every last one of us."</TE>
<TE>   Dey, more optimistic, protests that he's being unfair. "I love
that everybody is really an actress, really a singer--after they get
off work at the bank. The waiter is really writing a play. Dream on."</TE>
<TE>   In the years since, I've often thought about those lines. Yet
despite the fact that I was not long out of college myself then and
knew many more waiters writing plays and bank tellers who went out on
auditions, nothing much appears to have changed--including the toll
exacted by doing one thing while dreaming of doing another.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, those who have broken into the big time, like La Salle,
can breathlessly discuss their craft in philosophical terms. By
contrast, a bit more pragmatism is necessary for the majority who
carry trays several hours a day to underwrite what amounts to a
hobby.</TE>
<TE>   For this contingent, acting, as I think Robin Williams once
observed, is a career in which your job is finding a job, and the
actual work is the vacation. The fortitude that goes into that hunt
can be truly awe-inspiring, occasionally to the detriment of personal
relationships when those committing untold hours to achieving their
breakthrough tell a loved one who doesn't secretly want to play
Hamlet or Juliet, "My job is important too."</TE>
<TE>   More than once, no doubt, a significant other has ignited an
argument by replying, "I'm sorry, but what has your job paid for
around here lately?"</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Hollywood's presentation of this dilemma skews
toward the brighter side of attaining fame and fortune. In mainstream
fare, at least, plucky heroes and heroines usually come to happy
endings, from the welder by day/dancer by night in "Flashdance" to
last year's "Glitter," a vehicle for Mariah Carey.</TE>
<TE>   If tragedy plays a part in these stories, it's generally of the "A
Star Is Born" variety, with protagonists seduced and done in by the
aftermath of success. In that respect, the most notable aspect of
last year's cinematic mishmash "Mulholland Drive" is the film's
willingness to subvert those stereotypes with a vision of the
Hollywood dream-turned-nightmare, although director David Lynch's
cavalier sense of story structure (translation: the film doesn't have
one) has resulted in this point being lost on many who staggered out
of the theater.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond such fictional works, the last few years have brought an
entirely new wrinkle to the pursuit of celebrity in the form of
so-called "reality television," providing enough success stories to
keep dangling a very large carrot in front of people who never leave
home without a resume and head shot tucked under one arm.</TE>
<TE>   Colleen Haskell, for example, parlayed her participation in the
original "Survivor" into a co-starring role with Rob Schneider in
last year's movie "The Animal," which seems like more of an ordeal
than eating bug larvae. Few survivors of unscripted series have fared
as well, but the thousands who line up at each open audition suggest
that hope springs eternal.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, a strain of this programming genre has played directly
to those for whom gaining admission to the entertainment business is
an objective. Home Box Office's "Project Greenlight," for example,
has chronicled the travails of a fledgling screenwriter-director who
earned the right to have his screenplay produced in exchange for
allowing a documentary crew to capture the process. A whopping 7,300
scripts were submitted via the Internet before Pete Jones was chosen,
although many who have viewed the series may question what exactly he
has won over the long haul.</TE>
<TE>   Even closer to the off-the-bus fantasy were ABC's "Making the
Band" and the WB network's "Popstars," both unscripted concepts
devoted to the creation of made-for-TV pop acts (a new boy band and
girl group, respectively) after trailing hopefuls through the
auditions--a conceit that E! Entertainment Television took to its own
logical extreme with the self-explanatory "Vegas Showgirls."</TE>
<TE>   Although a fair amount has been written about the inside
perspective provided by "Project Greenlight," a less celebrated but
perhaps more telling look at an aspiring filmmaker played last year
on the Independent Film Channel. In that production, the director
lets a documentary crew tail him as he pursues his dream to make a
movie until--after running out of money--the depressed protagonist
takes his own life.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, "They Shoot Movies, Don't They? ... The Making of Mirage"
was actually a work of fiction produced and directed by two actors,
Tom Wilson and Frank Gallagher, but many of those who stumbled upon
the low-budget, slyly documentary-style production came away
convinced that what they had seen was real--including even a few
entertainment industry pros who screened it. That reaction came as
little surprise to Wilson, who maxed out his credit cards to finance
the project.</TE>
<TE>   "You write what you know," he said last year, when IFC first
televised "They Shoot Movies," leaving viewers to wonder about its
authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood and its surroundings, of course, will always provide a
beacon to those who harbor the goal of stardom in one form or another
(Canadian production hubs Vancouver and Toronto are equally
legitimate destinations for actors these days, but that's another
story), and no amount of discouragement will dampen their enthusiasm.
Beyond the lure of riches, there is the simple hunger to perform that
La Salle spoke of--a point exemplified by "A Chorus Line's" key
number, "What I Did for Love," laying bare what impels many to chase
rainbows with no pot of gold at their end.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, perhaps that's as it should be. As always, very few
will make it. The rest can ultimately call themselves whatever it
takes to remind or convince them that they are really a writer,
really an actress, and really living just a few freeway exits from

<DH>'To Do Battle' spans centuries and civilizations to record
the art of conflict at the Norton Simon.</DH>

<LD>It's the good guys versus the bad guys and it shouldn't be a pretty
picture. But this is the Norton Simon Museum, so of course it is. One
after the other, the works in the museum's new exhibition, "To Do
Battle: Conflict, Struggle and Symbol in Art," prove that the most
effective way to deliver an ugly message is to make it look
beautiful.</LD>
<LD>   Paradoxical as it may seem, artists have done exactly that through
the ages, says curator Gloria Williams, who organized the
show--mainly from the Simon's collection, with a few loans from the
J. Paul Getty Museum and UCLA's Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts.
Perhaps because human nature doesn't change, themes of aggression are
a staple in art from 5th century BC Greece to 20th century America,
she says. They are used for political ends, as allegories of good and
evil, to justify war, promote religion and establish a narrative of
good versus evil.</LD>
<TE>   Williams points out such themes in the eclectic assembly that
fills the temporary exhibition space. A life-size Roman ruler, carved
in limestone in the 3rd century, stands on guard near the entrance to
the show. The Hindu god Shiva, stationed on a nearby pedestal,
assumes his most terrifying stance to ward off demons in a 16th
century bronze figure equipped with four weapon-bearing arms and a
halo of flames. Other militant icons from Southeast Asia are
installed nearby, including a temple guardian portrayed in an 11th
century sandstone sculpture from Cambodia and a thunderbolt
personified in a 10th century bronze from Nepal.</TE>
<TE>   On the adjacent wall, the beat goes on in art from a different
time and place: 17th century Holland. Jan van Bijlert's painting,
"Man in Armour Holding a Pike," depicts a peacock-like soldier
looking over his shoulder at his audience. He's a symbol of virility,
rather like today's sports heroes, Williams says, but he probably
delivers a political message as well. His orange sash and feathers
likely signify his allegiance with the Prince of Orange, when the
Netherlands was at war with Spain.</TE>
<TE>   As the show unfolds, it presents pockets of works that are closely
related in subject matter and media as well as time and place, but it
also leaps over continents and centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Orpheus is attacked by Thracian women in a painting on a 5th
century BC ceramic bowl from Greece. The Hindu god Vishnu calmly
disembowels an evil titan who tried to deter his son from worship in
an 11th century stone carving. Two Japanese warriors carry on a duel
in an 1881 color woodcut by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi. With one of the
protagonists airborne, it is certain to remind film buffs of
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."</TE>
<TE>   All the artworks tell stories that can be interpreted in a
contemporary light. An 18th century Indian chess set, for example,
pits the Sikhs against the Afghans. Still other pieces seem to cover
all bases. Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens' circa-1630 painting of
David slaying Goliath illustrates a biblical tale, but it also
represents "light versus dark, Hebrews versus Philistines, St.
Michael the archangel beating down the devil or Christ and the
anti-Christ," Williams says.</TE>
<TE>   As she readily acknowledges, "To Do Battle" takes on a huge theme.
Organized in six thematic sections--"Symbol," "Battle Between Man and
Animal," "Battle of Love," "The Battle Piece," "Battle Between Good
and Evil" and "Horrors of War"--the show offered Williams an
opportunity to display works that have languished in storage and to
take a fresh look at well-known pieces in the museum's collection.</TE>
<TE>   Still, her project is merely a slice of a subject that could be
explored many other ways, she says.</TE>
<TE>   So why is conflict such a persistent, nearly ubiquitous subject in
art?</TE>
<TE>   Art historians say it's largely a matter of aesthetic traditions
that have evolved from ancient mythology and literature. The stories
may be told in heroic or fanciful terms, but they deal with issues
that continue to plague ordinary mortals. The most enduring tales
grapple with fundamental issues of family relations, religion and
politics as well as outright war.</TE>
<TE>   "The Greeks fall back upon myths that serve as archetypes when it
comes to issues of violence and conflict," says Peter Holliday,
associate professor of the history of art and classical archeology at
Cal State Long Beach. "They use these archetypes, both artistically
and in literary terms, as catalysts for exploration of the human
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a richness in these myths that allows versatility; the
myth is so archetypal that it's generic to the point of being
universal," he says. "You see this even in some of the great
monuments. The sculpture decorating the Parthenon celebrates the
Greek victory over the Persians and yet the artists fall back upon
themes of Greeks versus Amazons, gods versus giants or Lapiths versus
Centaurs. They have the ability to see their specific history through
these archetypes."</TE>
<TE>   Scenes of violence and conflict are portrayed as "opposing forces
that are sketched very broadly so that they become light versus dark,
order versus chaos, East versus West, civilization versus barbarism,"
Holliday says. "And yet, going back to the epic tradition in Homer
and continuing in the visual arts, the battles are rendered as duels
between individuals. We are able to project into a very human
experience of the hand-to-hand combat in war, and see the heroes and
the gods as representatives of human traits and types. We see them in
conflict."</TE>
<TE>   The Romans took a different approach.</TE>
<TE>   "They show specific, recognizable contemporary humans," he says.
"In the Republican period, the Romans use art as a means of
furthering their own political careers, not for the greater social
good. This continues into the empire, except that the only patron
then is the emperor himself. We always see the emperor fighting, the
emperor having barbarians surrender to him, the emperor dispensing
justice. Portraits depict recognizable figures, instead of gods and
heroes. At the same time, the Romans appropriate Greek artistic
types, so you find the emperor as Achilles or a Roman general as
Hercules, in one-on-one combat as the forces of good versus evil."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, in Indian art, "you don't see historical violence
represented; it's the mythological counterparts, which have a
timeless character," says Pratapaditya Pal, a research fellow at the
Norton Simon Museum, consulting curator at the Art Institute of
Chicago and former chief curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art at
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   "Hindu art is concerned mainly with myths and the myths are about
sex and violence," Pal says. Both of the great epics of India, the
Mahabharata and the Ramayana, are basically concerned with these two
themes. They form the crux of the narrative, no matter how you gloss
it with spiritual elements and interpretations. In the Mahabharata,
two families of cousins fight for the kingdom. In the Ramayana,
Rama's wife is abducted by the king of Sri Lanka and he has to do
battle to bring her back. The suspicion was that she was not just
abducted but perhaps raped."</TE>
<TE>   The Bhagavad-Gita, a key religious text in the Mahabharata that
relates the essence of Hindu philosophy, also has a violent theme, he
says. Narrated by Krishna on a battlefield, the story explains "why
it was correct for him to go and kill his cousins--the sort of
arguments that are still put forth as the rationale for just wars,"
Pal says.</TE>
<TE>   Buddhism, which is often characterized as a particularly peaceful
religion, produces equally violent images but "with a spiritual
spin," he says. "Demonic-looking gods are always fighting and
posturing to rid the world of external demons and the demons within
us. Take the very concept of Buddha's enlightenment; he was literally
attacked by the hordes of Mara, the evil genius of Buddhist
mythology. The twist is that Buddha repelled him peacefully, simply
by his own will power."</TE>
<TE>   Holliday contends that little has changed in terms of "how we mark
out the enemy as the other" in art and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Renaissance depictions of battles often rely on traditional
"artistic typologies, formal compositions or even the same themes.
And it continues into the 20th century," he says. One of the last
works in the exhibition, a 1965 lithograph by Leon Golub, tackles the
Greek subject of a gigantomachy, a struggle between gods and giants,
he notes. "In some ways, the Greek archetypes become symbols through
the ages. Certainly there is a reason Freud went back to the Greeks
to find archetypes for human situations in the psyche," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   As to why we are drawn to depictions of violence, Holliday asks a
few questions: "Why do we crawl to a standstill and crane our necks
when there is an accident on the freeway? Why is hockey so popular,
or stock car racing? Are we that different from the Romans who
watched gladiatorial combats at the arena?"</TE>
<TE>   Still, artworks that portray horrific events "have to be beautiful
enough that we want to look at them," he says. "Gloria and the Norton
Simon have taken on an ugly theme, but there are not going to be ugly
works of art in the exhibition."</TE>

<LD>As protests go, the one mounted five years ago outside the Orange
County Performing Arts Center to deplore the hiring practices of one
of the world's greatest orchestras was small, quiet and rather
elegant.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the 60 or so picketers came attired in evening gowns and
handsome suits. One of their signs said, "Vienna Philharmonic
Discriminates--Musical Ability Does Not Know Gender or Race." They
all wore big white buttons with a black musical note in the middle
and the slogan "Gender Blind" in large red letters. Among them were a
mother and son who played a duet on flute and violin.</LD>
<LD>   Deon Nielsen Price, one of the protest leaders, recalls that
patrons flocking to the charms of Mozart's Symphony No. 29 and the
mystical depths of Bruckner's Ninth on that early March evening were
not keen on stopping to hear about gender prejudice.</LD>
<TE>   "They were pretty unfriendly. They looked straight ahead, as
people do."</TE>
<TE>   But the protesters already had won their round. Their
informational picketing was the understated coda to a monthlong
crescendo against a visiting orchestra that, no matter how esteemed
for its music, was going to be hard put in America to justify its
155-year-old policy of excluding women.</TE>
<TE>   After convulsive weeks in which its then-president at one point
vowed to dissolve the orchestra rather than bow to pressure, the
Vienna Philharmonic made history Feb. 27, 1997, the eve of its
departure for Costa Mesa, by rescinding its ban on women. Anna
Lelkes, who had played the harp in the orchestra for 23 years as an
anonymous adjunct never accorded even a program credit, was declared
a member in time for the Vienna Philharmonic's arrival for shows in
Orange County and New York's Carnegie Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "They were terribly frightened by the possibility of
demonstrations by American women's rights activists," Lelkes told an
Austrian newspaper at the time. "I believe that this pressure was
decisive."</TE>
<TE>   The Vienna Philharmonic returns to Orange County Monday through
Wednesday for its first West Coast concerts since that turbulent
time. Orchestra leaders say they have entered a new era of fair and
full meritocracy for men and women alike. Leaders of the
International Alliance for Women in Music and the National
Organization for Women, which mustered the pressure in 1997, are not
so sure.</TE>
<TE>   This year, five women will be among the 90 touring philharmonic
players, but only as substitutes--the barrier-breaking Lelkes retired
in 2001. Among the current crop of women, two--a harpist and a
violist--are eligible to become full-fledged members of the Vienna
Philharmonic in a few years, the others are freelancers.</TE>
<TE>   Five years after the rules changed, more women than ever are
playing with the Vienna Philharmonic, but the members, all 142 of
them, are men.</TE>
<TE>   How can things be better and worse for women at the Vienna
Philharmonic? The answer has to do with the labyrinthine
institutional structure of the orchestra and how its members are
chosen.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe an analogy would help.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine that, in addition to playing the regular baseball season
at full salary, the veteran players on the Los Angeles Dodgers were
free to go barnstorming on their own. They could schedule games as
they pleased and keep all the gate receipts and money from souvenir
sales. But only three-year veterans of the Dodgers would get to be in
this barnstorming unit. Maybe some rookies could come along as
occasional fill-ins, but not as full-fledged members.</TE>
<TE>   The Vienna Philharmonic is the barnstorming unit that plays 120
concerts a year on tour and at festivals. It runs its own affairs and
keeps the cash from its concerts and CD sales. The Vienna State Opera
Orchestra is the regular, everyday franchise. It is a
government-funded operation that stays put and plays 300 performances
a year. Its 155 members include all 142 Vienna Philharmonic
barnstormers, plus 13 others who would like to be barnstormers but
aren't considered seasoned enough yet. To join the philharmonic, a
player has to serve three years in the Vienna State Opera
orchestra--and then be voted in by a majority of the Vienna
Philharmonic's members. Once in, tenure is for life--until the
group's mandatory retirement age of 65.</TE>
<TE>   From 1997 through 2002, according to the philharmonic, 16
positions have come open at the Vienna State Opera. Women have won
the auditions for three of them, achieving places in the pipeline for
philharmonic membership. One, a harpist, recently dropped out. She
resigned voluntarily, philharmonic officials say, unhappy about a pay
cut. Another harpist, Charlotte Balzereit, and violist Ursula
Plaichinger remain; they will be eligible for Vienna Philharmonic
membership in 2004 and 2005, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really poor progress," says Matthea Marquart, president of
the New York City NOW chapter. "I can't tell an orchestra from
another country that they should be doing quotas, but they're going
to have to make a better effort to recruit women."</TE>
<TE>   "You can't change things overnight or even in a few years,"
responds Mary Lou Falcone, a New York publicist for the Vienna
Philharmonic. "This process takes time and patience and
understanding."</TE>
<TE>   Are women getting a fair shot in rookie auditions for the Vienna
State Opera? When they reach the three-year mark, will this all-male
club vote them in?</TE>
<TE>   The philharmonic's two spokesmen, President Clemens Hellsberg, a
violinist, and percussionist Wolfgang Schuster, refused a request for
a telephone interview, but agreed to answer some questions in writing
and to let Falcone respond to others.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing like American-style affirmative action is going to happen,
Falcone said. The philharmonic will not set hiring goals or quotas
for women or change its three-year waiting period for membership,
which has been the rule since 1973. All spots will be awarded to the
musicians who can best achieve the philharmonic's distinctive style
and sound.</TE>
<TE>   Falcone said that Schuster has told her the Vienna State Opera
aims to grant auditions to "as many women as possible." Seiji Ozawa,
the longtime Boston Symphony conductor who has built
gender-integrated orchestras here and in Japan, will have a vote at
auditions starting this fall, when he takes over as music director
there.</TE>
<TE>   Auditions follow common practices used in America as well. The
judges--a panel of 25 orchestra members and officials of the Vienna
State Opera--listen without being able to see the players in the
early rounds. But finalists are seen as well as heard.</TE>
<TE>   Before 1997, in the men-only days, some philharmonic members did
not try to disguise their sexism.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we make music here is not only a technical ability, but
has a lot to do with the soul. The soul does not let itself be
separated from the cultural roots that we have here in Central
Europe, and it also doesn't allow itself to be separated from
gender," said one player in a 1996 German radio interview
disseminated by the International Alliance for Women in Music to
build support for its 1997 protest.</TE>
<TE>   Schuster says that the ban on women fell by a two-thirds majority
vote of the membership. And now, the holdouts, mainly members of the
philharmonic's old guard, are coming around--thanks in part to esteem
for Plaichinger, the viola player who auditioned successfully last
year. Schuster says she has impressed everyone as a substitute
performing with the Vienna Philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a very nice colleague, and she is accepted as a first-rank
musician by all colleagues," he wrote. "For sure she has contributed
to the fact that prejudices against the engagement of women have
broken up [among] the older musicians."</TE>
<TE>   If Plaichinger and harpist Balzereit make it through the pipeline,
the Vienna Philharmonic will have taken eight years to induct three
women. At that rate, says William Osborne, an American composer
living in Germany whose articles about exclusionary practices helped
spark the 1997 protests, it will take a generation or more for women
in the Vienna Philharmonic to attain even the 5% to 10%
representation he says is typical of other elite central European
orchestras. The average is 30% in top U.S. orchestras.</TE>
<TE>   "Having five [women] substitutes travel with the orchestra is,
absolutely, progress. It is tiny, though, because they are not
members," said Elena Ostleitner, a professor of music sociology at
Vienna's Hochschule fur Musik, a prestigious conservatory. She has
been working since 1980 to improve women's status in the Austrian
musical world. "Compared to past years, it is progress, but I will be
more happy if gifted young female musicians have the opportunity to
belong to this really marvelous orchestra."</TE>
<TE>   Each season since 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic has returned to
Carnegie Hall, and NOW and the International Alliance for Women in
Music have put up small informational protests each time. They argue
that even though women no longer are banned and some are in the
pipeline, the slow pace of inclusion signals tokenism rather than a
commitment to equal opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Still, no protest is planned in Southern California. Alliance
leaders say they will send letters urging the Philharmonic Society of
Orange County, the Vienna Philharmonic's local presenter, and
companies and individuals who underwrite the concerts to encourage
more rapid change in the orchestra. They hope American groups that
book the Vienna Philharmonic at least will raise the issue.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not likely. "It really is a nonissue now," said Robert
Harth, executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall, which will
host three concerts after the three in Costa Mesa. "The Vienna
Philharmonic has addressed the issue. We like the direction they're
going in" regarding the inclusion of women.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Corey, executive director of the Philharmonic Society of
Orange County, also finds complaints about gender problems "kind of a
moot point," given the changes that began five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   By the next decade, it should be clear whether it really is moot.
Over the next five to seven years, says Falcone, a third of the
orchestra's chairs--nearly 50 positions--will have to be filled due
to retirement, providing plenty of opportunities to improve its
gender balance.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, President Hellsberg hopes the public will follow its
ears in judging the Vienna Philharmonic. "Our statement is in our
music making," he wrote.  "Please let the music speak for us."</TE>
<TE>   Price, the Culver City pianist, composer and college music teacher
who helped guide the 1997 protests as International Alliance for
Women in Music president, grants that the music speaks beautifully.
But she wants audiences to listen with their eyes open.</TE>
<TE>   "I want people to notice what it looks like on stage [with just a
smattering of women], and how unusual that is in the United States,
because we are just not used to seeing such exclusivity. I hope they
enjoy the music. I would also like them to realize the music could
sound just as good with more diversity in the ranks, and it would be
much healthier."</TE>

<LD>More and more, classical radio stations shun vocal music. The vocal
recital is becoming a rarity in concert halls. Stellar soloists keep
getting dropped from record company rosters. Recording operas is less
and less economically feasible.</LD>
<LD>   It would be easy to conclude that there is not much of a future
for vocal discs, especially recitals of standard opera arias or art
songs, and it would be easy to be wrong.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, labels, little and large, are positively infatuated with
recital discs.</LD>
<TE>   For stars such as Bryn Terfel, it's costs-be-damned: His first
Wagner recording is accompanied by Claudio Abbado and the Berlin
Philharmonic. A young Czech mezzo-soprano, Magdalena Kozena, who is
glamorous-looking enough to pass for a fashion model, is lavishly
packaged and generously advertised. One young singer after another is
heralded as "the Fourth Tenor" and given major record company
promotion.</TE>
<TE>   Is all this one last vestige of classical recording folly, just
the kind of thing that got the industry into its current financial
difficulties? Or are the labels on to something?</TE>
<TE>   The Times' classical reviewers take a look at the latest crop of
vocal recitals to find out.</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   WAGNER: Various arias</TE>
<TE>   Bryn Terfel</TE>
<TE>   Deutsche Grammophon</TE>
<TE>   On his first Wagner recording, this all-conquering Welsh singer is
simply stupendous. He may yet be a bit too boisterous for Wagner's
bass-baritone roles--those old men who carry the weight of the
world's suffering, and their own sins, on their shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Try though he does, he cannot quite settle down into the weary,
dreary angst of Amfortas in "Parsifal." But there is no Wagnerian
baritone or bass today with the kind of immediate vocal presence and
personality of Terfel.</TE>
<TE>   The vitality he brings to Hans Sachs, in two arias from "The
Mastersingers of Nuremberg," makes the wise, lovable cobbler all the
more human. As Wotan singing his moving farewell to Brunnhilde at the
end of "The Valkyrie," Terfel's tenderness, his reserves of power
that rise through the tears, break the heart.</TE>
<TE>   Claudio Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic elevate every note they
play.</TE>
<TE>   One not too distant day, Terfel will likely become our greatest
Wagner singer.</TE>

<TE>   "FRENCH OPERA ARIAS"</TE>
<TE>   Ben Heppner</TE>
<TE>   Deutsche Grammophon</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   "FRENCH ARIAS"</TE>
<TE>   Marcelo Alvarez</TE>
<TE>   Sony Classical</TE>
<TE>   Heldentenor Ben Heppner's venture into 19th century French opera
repertory, accompanied by the London Symphony led by Myung-Whun
Chung, isn't a complete success. He sings with the power, heft and
evenness that have made him formidable in German repertory, but all
that vocal weight takes a toll against Gallic intimacy, light and
shade and charm. The slow tempos favored by both singer and conductor
expose Heppner's sustained notes pulsing ominously. He also often
pushes into the heights with more strain than ease. He is best in
Eleazar's heroic defiance of the crowds shouting for his death
(Halevy's "La Juive"), Rodrigue's call to arms (Massenet's "Le Cid")
or Berlioz's cantata-like setting of "La Marseillaise." Then things
take off.</TE>
<TE>   Argentine Alvarez (one of the heralded "Fourth Tenors") will never
conquer Heppner's heavy German repertory, but he has more of the
right stuff for passionate French and bel canto opera--lightness,
youthful idealism, varied shades of color, a caressing and
fascinating line, and a secure range from intimacy to heroic
declamation. If his high Cs aren't always totally thrilling ("Pour
mon ame" from Donizetti's "La fille du regiment"), they still blossom
ardently, beautifully. Highlights on this disc, in which Alvarez is
well-supported by forces from the Nice Opera, led by Mark Elder,
include "Seul sur la terre" (from Donizetti's "Dom Sebastien") and
"Ah! Fuyez, douce image" (from Massenet's "Manon").</TE>
<TE>   Like Heppner, he has trouble in the heights of "Plus blanche que
la blanche hermine" (Meyerbeer's "Les Huguenots"), the only aria the
two discs have in common. He's also taxed, as any human tenor would
be, in Arnold's rallying the troops from Rossini's "Guillaume Tell."</TE>
<TE>   --Chris Pasles</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   "LE BELLE IMMAGINI"</TE>
<TE>   Magdalena Kozena</TE>
<TE>   Deutsche Grammophon</TE>
<TE>   This Czech beauty has made three previous recordings, two of
Handel and one of her native art songs, and already she seems to have
as many looks as Madonna.</TE>
<TE>   This latest CD shows her in seductive soft focus with long
straight blond hair, lounging by the riverside in a ponytail, and
with Botticelli curls in front of Frank Gehry's famous Prague bank
building known as "Fred and Ginger." Should we be suspicious?
Absolutely. Should we listen? Absolutely. Hype or no hype, there
happens to be yet another outstanding mezzo on the scene. Kozena is a
high mezzo, almost a soprano, who brings a winning balance of vocal
poise and dramatic fire that seems just right for the selection of
lesser-known arias from Mozart, Gluck and Josef Myslivecek, a Czech
composer who was 19 years Mozart's senior. Like most singers in their
20s, she does not yet reveal a strong individual personality. But she
is marvelously musical, theatrically compelling and vocally alluring.
Her looks may accelerate her rise to stardom, but her voice is what
will keep her there.</TE>

<TE>   Ewa Podles</TE>

<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   ROSSINI: Arias and Sinfonias</TE>
<TE>   Maria Bayo, soprano</TE>
<TE>   Astree/Naive</TE>
<TE>   Showpiece arias sung by the veteran Polish contralto Ewa Podles
and by the relative newcomer Maria Bayo--who sang Susanna in L.A.
Opera's "Marriage of Figaro" in 2001--comprise the content of these
albums. Podles' performances were part of the 1998 Wratislavia
Cantans Festival in Wroclaw, Poland. Italian soprano Bayo recorded
her performances in July 2001 in Rome, with the period-instrument
ensemble Concerto Italiano.</TE>
<TE>   Podles effortlessly dominates the musical landscape in excerpts
from "Barbiere," "Tancredi," "Semiramide," "Maometto II," "La Donna
del Lago" and "L'Italiana in Algeri," artistically handling her rich
middle voice, deep lower octave and brilliant high notes with
practiced grandeur. The music is ennobling, but hearing all these
test pieces at one time is like eating a box of See's candy at one
sitting.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Bayo's huge talent embraces the listener with
an abundance of vocal beauty and heady technical accomplishment in
her Rossini survey. She sings six excerpts from "La Scala di Seta,"
"Tancredi" and "La Gazza Ladra," among others, with exceptional
adroitness, subtlety and creamy tone. She is felicitously accompanied
by the Concerto Italiano ensemble and an attentive conductor.</TE>
<TE>   --Daniel Cariaga</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   "WHILE I DREAM"</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Bonney</TE>
<TE>   Decca</TE>
<TE>   One of America's most popular sopranos, Bonney has proved to be
one of its more resourceful as well. On this recital disc--which
contains a dozen songs by Liszt and Schumann's song cycle
"Dichterliebe" (A Poet's Love)--she accomplishes something altogether
remarkable. It is unusual, but not unheard of, for a woman to sing
Schumann's cycle, in which a poet pours out the course of his love
from sexual awakening to lost love and despair. Lotte Lehmann sang
the songs in the '40s, simply reversing the gender. Bonney, however,
is more interesting, interpreting the songs, she writes in the notes,
as a woman interprets a man. It is his feelings she recounts, but in
her voice, as if reading his letters and internalizing his emotions.
As a result, there are different dramatic tensions than we are used
to, and a very familiar work takes on a new dimension. The singing is
gorgeous, as it is in the dreamy Liszt songs, and Antonio Pappano,
who takes over as music director of Royal Opera in the fall, is a
stimulating accompanist.</TE>
<TE>   -- M.S.</TE>
<TE>   ***  1/2</TE>
<TE>   CHAMINADE: "Mots d'amour''</TE>
<TE>   Anne Sofie von Otter</TE>
<TE>   Deutsche Grammophon</TE>
<TE>   This lively recording brings to the fore the too-little-known
music of French composer Cecile Chaminade (1857-1944), whose
popularity was limited by her 19th century tastes at a time of
transition into Modernism, not to mention the matter of her gender in
the male-dominated world of composing. Swedish mezzo-soprano Anne
Sofie von Otter has been working in the crossover trenches, on last
year's interesting if strange collaboration with Elvis Costello. Back
on firmer idiomatic ground, Otter gives persuasive and considered
readings of 25 Chaminade songs, many in their premiere recordings
here. Smartly accompanied by pianist Bengt Forsberg, the recording
states a case for wider recognition for this composer. Part of the
mission, though somewhat distracting to the album's sense of context,
are several of the composer's delightful little pieces, for violin
and piano and for two pianos, with assistance from violinist
Nils-Erik Sparf and pianist Peter Jablonski.</TE>
<TE>   --Josef Woodard</TE>
<TE>   ****</TE>
<TE>   ROSSINI: Arias</TE>
<TE>   Juan Diego Florez</TE>
<TE>   Decca</TE>
<TE>   Juan Diego Florez is yet another brilliant young talent from South
America. The 29-year-old tenor from Peru sings this unhackneyed
collection of eight showpiece arias with body, strength, heart, and
supreme ease and confidence. He has admirable agility and thrilling
high notes, and knows how to shape a phrase with assurance and
intelligence. You can detect a slight, tight vibrato, but the voice
opens gloriously on top. The only caveat is that in recording, the
size of the voice cannot accurately be determined. Word on the street
is that the disc doesn't do justice to Florez on stage. The chorus
sings with bright verve. Riccardo Chailly conducts Milan's Guiseppe
Verdi Symphony Orchestra and Chorus with stylish lightness, speed and
sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   --C.P.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   "AIRS BAROQUE FRANCAIS"</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Petitbon</TE>
<TE>   Virgin Veritas</TE>
<TE>   This young French soprano, who has a much wider repertory than her
reputation as a collaborator with the early-music group Les Arts
Florissants would indicate, she stays with French Baroque composers
here, tilting toward excerpts from Rameau's operas. The program
really takes off when Petitbon throws herself into her characters.
When keening about in "Madness" from Rameau's "Platee," her
deliberately unreliable pitch and slightly demented laughter do
indeed suggest madness. She pushes emotion over the top in two arias
from Lully's "Armide" as the wheezy period band backing her goes
crazy with drums and wind machine. Lucky for us that she has the
irreverence to close with Grandval's wicked cantata for aggravated
sopranos, "Rien du Tout" (Nothing at All)--which must be heard to be
believed.</TE>
<TE>   --Richard S. Ginell</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   "BEL SOGNO"</TE>
<TE>   Cristina Gallardo-Domas</TE>
<TE>   Teldec</TE>
<TE>   Chilean Gallardo-Domas is starting to get some prime assignments
on high-profile complete opera recordings. Yet one wonders what the
future holds for this rising diva. On track after track, she displays
a melting, winsome timbre in the middle register that slightly
resembles that of Maria Callas. But when she soars into the upper
reaches at top volume, her vibrato becomes a wobble and her tone
often turns abrasive. After opening nods to Cilea, Donizetti,
Catalani and Bellini, the rest of the program is mostly
meat-and-potatoes Verdi and Puccini. Although Gallardo-Domas is aware
of the drama and displays some temperament, do her interpretations
justify another recording of chestnuts like "Sempre libera" and "Un
bel di"? Not at this point.</TE>

<LD>Nobody depicts hell like Hieronymous Bosch. Even an American,
subjected to all kinds of kinetic mayhem on TV or at the movies, may
look into one of Bosch's painted nightmares and let out a gasp. Bosch
is famous for his landscapes of damnation, crammed with hapless
sinners being tortured--sliced, diced, roasted and chomped upon by
part-human, part-beast, part-machine denizens of the underworld.</LD>
<LD>   Since December, it's been possible for Southern Californians to
add Bosch, up close and personal, to their horror catalogs. A Bosch
triptych, "The Last Judgment," has landed in a two-work show,
"Choices and Inspirations: The Temptation of St. Anthony," at the
Timken Museum of Art in San Diego's Balboa Park. Borrowed from the
Groeningemuseum in Bruges, Belgium, the Bosch, painted circa 1480 in
the Netherlands, is paired with a painting from the Timken's
collection, Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo's "Temptation of St. Anthony,"
painted in Italy around 1527.</LD>
<LD>   The idea is to showcase the parallels between the hell depicted in
Savoldo's work and the hell in Bosch's painting. The fact that the
Italian artist borrowed heavily from his northern counterpart was
noted by art historians in the early 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   It is the Timken's coup to finally put the two together, side by
side. And it came about almost by accident.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a request from Bruges to borrow both our Petrus Christus
["Death of the Virgin"] and Savoldo," says Hal Fischer, director of
exhibitions at the Timken, a boutique museum begun by San Diego's
Putnam sisters, Anne and Amy, whose holdings number fewer than 60
works. "When you have a small collection but choice work, they're
often requested."</TE>
<TE>   In return, Till Borchert, guest curator for the Groeningemuseum,
suggested that the Timken might want to exhibit the Bosch. As a
Flemish paintings expert, Borchert was aware of the long-noted
connections between the "The Last Judgment" and the Timken's Savoldo.</TE>
<TE>   There are only a handful of Bosch paintings and drawings in the
U.S.--and no triptychs. The last time a three-panel Bosch had visited
the United States, Fischer believes, was for a 1991 National Gallery
of Art show, "Circa 1492: Art in the Age of Exploration."</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't dare ask for the Bosch," says Fischer, who immediately
jumped at the rare opportunity. "You could have knocked me off my
chair."</TE>
<TE>   "Choices and Inspirations" is the third and final installment of
small exhibitions the Timken began last year to highlight various
issues in art history. The first was on conservation and showed how
proper cleaning and restoration can change the look of a work. The
second, on provenance, traced the history of ownership of several
works, including the Timken's John Singleton Copley ("Mrs. Thomas
Gage") and Rembrandt ("St. Bartholomew").</TE>
<TE>   For the third show, Fischer says, he wanted to look at the process
of a painting's creation. He had already been thinking of using the
Savoldo as the centerpiece. "I deliberately picked [it]," he says,
"because it was unusual--he's mainly known for portraits."
Furthermore, he wanted to explore the increasingly popular idea that
there was cross-fertilization between northern and southern painting
traditions in the 1400s and 1500s. With the offer of the Bosch, that
topic became an even stronger element in the exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   "Art doesn't just spring forth," Fischer explains. "There are
precedents, antecedents, and yet an artist still brings his or her
own originality and inventiveness to this."</TE>
<TE>   In the exhibition, wall labels provide background on the artists
and the traditions they represent, and on the commercial and cultural
ties between Venice and cities such as Antwerp and Bruges.</TE>
<TE>   Bosch, born in 1450, was active from 1480 until his death in 1516
in what is now the Netherlands. His works, whose fantastical scenes
are thought to be keyed to specific Dutch folk sayings and lore, were
highly prized and often copied throughout Europe. "The Last
Judgment," which some scholars attribute solely to Bosch, may have
come out of his workshop. Although its exact provenance is unknown,
at least one work like it can be traced to a Venetian cardinal named
Grimani. A 1521 account lists three Bosch works in the cardinal's
collection, including a "canvas of hell with monsters."</TE>
<TE>   What seems to be beyond doubt is that Savoldo, born at about the
time "The Last Judgment" was painted, in Brescia, Italy, 500 miles
from Bosch's home territory, saw this particular painting--or a copy
or print of it--and borrowed heavily from it.</TE>
<TE>   Could it have been another Bosch that Savoldo saw? "No, no,"
Fischer replies, "and that is really what makes this a unique
situation. It's so direct, the appropriated images are so specific."</TE>
<TE>   In Bosch's triptych, Christ is enthroned in heaven, surrounded by
angels at the top of the central panel. The left panel shows the
blessed enjoying a blissful if slightly eerie afterlife listening to
music and cavorting in green pastures around a lake and a white
tower. Meanwhile, the lower part of the central panel and the right
panel show a host of diabolical ways the damned are being tortured
for all eternity. The painting is densely detailed, demanding close
inspection of every group of figures and each nook and cranny of the
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the three-panel paradise and hell format, Bosch's figures
and landscapes fill the entire triptych space, without clear lines of
separating the scenes. That, says Fischer, is indicative of the
northern Renaissance's ties to the overall compositional style of the
Middle Ages.</TE>
<TE>   Savoldo, on the other hand, clearly divides his single canvas in
two, with a rocky outcropping (an often-used symbol of hermit saints)
in the middle. This geometry is tied to the Italian Renaissance's
emphasis on Aristotelian ideals, according to the exhibition. It
makes a more unified impact, sending a clear message that this work
is about good opposed to evil.</TE>
<TE>   But Savoldo also uses that division to his own ends, to combine
two styles in one painting. The demarcation is emphatic. The left
side shows St. Anthony in a typical Italian manner, all painterly
modeling and fluttering robes, set against a rolling landscape with a
building in the distance, thought to be a monastery (St. Anthony was
a founder of the monastic tradition). The sun is out, the sky is
blue, and St. Anthony is fleeing from the dark torments opposite him.</TE>
<TE>   On the right side, flames engulf a ruined city and wretched humans
are tortured in a nocturnal landscape. The figures are gathered in
small groups that have to be carefully examined to see what is
actually going on. Out of all that generalized Boschian denseness,
detail and action, the exhibition calls out a handful of examples of
direct borrowing.</TE>
<TE>   One is a mill-wheel monster. In Bosch's painting and in Savoldo's,
a waterwheel--associated with futility or foolishness in Dutch
sayings--brings victims into the mouth of an oversized human head.
Both heads wear cages holding entrapped figures. The songbird--evoked
by the birdcage--also had an association with folly in Dutch lore.</TE>
<TE>   Other borrowed creatures include a lop-eared beast, which carries
a driver and a caldron holding huddled sinners on its back, and the
fish-cum-bird that has swallowed the upper half of a human being.
Even the colors of the half-eaten limbs and fish creature are the
same as those in "The Last Judgment."</TE>
<TE>   So what's a contemporary viewer to make of all of this plagiarism?
According to Walter Gibson, an art historian who has written on
Bosch, not much. Such blatant borrowing wasn't the transgression it
would be today. "If [patrons] couldn't get an original painting, they
would have a copy made," he says. Reproducing Bosch in whole or in
part "would have been a compliment" to the master.</TE>
<TE>   For Fischer, what's most important about Savoldo's work is not how
much the Italian painter borrowed from Bosch, but how he was able to
create out of it something that was his own--a "highly original work
of art," in the words of the wall labels at the Timken exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing the works side by side, he says, is "a real way of
communicating with audiences and giving them an expanded perspective
on looking at a work of art. It's not the artist working in his
atelier alone, but there's a very complex dialogue and interchange
and histories that go into a work of art."</TE>
<TE>   He happily notes that there has been record attendance at the
museum in January and February, and he assumes that the Bosch is the
biggest attraction.</TE>
<TE>   No matter, he says: "They may have seen a wonderful Bosch, but
they also have a new appreciation for something right in their own
community."</TE>

<DH>Hit songwriter Jeff Barry moved to Santa Barbara to relax,
but his neighbors had an idea for a musical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When songwriter Jeff Barry moved with his wife, Nancy, to Santa
Barbara six years ago, he planned on taking it easy and raising their
6-year-old twins in a peaceful setting. He could afford to relax: In
the '60s, Barry co-authored dozens of hits, including "Be My Baby,"
"Baby I Love You," "Doo Wah Diddy," "Da Doo Ron Ron," "Leader of the
Pack," "Sugar Sugar" "Iko, Iko" and "Chapel of Love."  He produced
the Monkees' "I'm a Believer." After moving to Los Angeles in 1970,
the Brooklyn-born tunesmith produced Neil Diamond's first singles and
later penned the theme song for TV's "Family Ties." That's a lot of
royalties.</LD>
<LD>   But a couple of years ago, two neighbors lured the 63-year-old
musician out of semi-retirement with their script about a
dysfunctional medieval kingdom. Which explains why, during a recent
interview, Barry found himself tenderly crooning a rueful ballad into
the telephone:</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a middle-aged woman in the Middle Ages and honey let me tell
you, it's a bad position/If life is like a battlefield and looks are
my weapon, I'm running out of ammunition."</LD>
<TE>   Without much prompting, Barry segued into the KISS-inspired
"Gratuitous Violence," then assumed the role of a court jester to
rattle off a Danny Kaye-like patter number called "I Am
Entertainment." They're among the songs featured in "Knight Life," a
new musical comedy Barry has composed, with book and lyrics by former
sitcom producers Robert Sternin and his wife, Prudence Fraser.
"Knight Life" opens Friday in a Music Theater of Santa Barbara
production.</TE>
<TE>   A few days earlier, Barry, Sternin and Fraser lunched at a
Hollywood restaurant around the corner from the rehearsal hall where
21 actors were about to begin their first "Knight Life" run-through.
It's the same show biz-saturated neighborhood where Sternin and
Fraser used to produce "Who's the Boss?" and seems a more likely
spawning ground for a cheeky musical than bucolic Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the young actors in "Knight Life" live and work primarily
in Los Angeles, but Barry said the posh beach community teems with
more established talent. Jeff Bridges, Rob Lowe, Dennis Franz, Dennis
Miller, John Cleese, Kirk Douglas, Sigourney Weaver and Jane Seymour
reportedly have homes in the Santa Barbara area. "What you have in
Santa Barbara are a lot of people who are successful enough to be
able to live up there, who think they're going to relax, and who all
eventually meet each other and become friends, and you have all this
creative energy that never stops flowing, so the next thing you know
the curtain's going up March 15!"</TE>
<TE>   That's pretty much how it happened for the "Knight Life"
collaborators. Barry met Sternin and Fraser three years ago at a
fund-raiser in Santa Barbara. The couple moved north in 1994 while
executive producing "The Nanny." When the series ended in 1999,
Sternin, 47, and Fraser, 48, decided to take a break to raise their
8-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   But Sternin had an idea that wouldn't leave him alone. He'd
pitched his first medieval comedy in 1982, three years after
graduating from UCLA with a master's degree in playwriting. In 1987,
he and Fraser created "The Charmings," a short-lived ABC sitcom
featuring Snow White waking up in contemporary times, then wrote a
Dark Ages comedy pilot for Fox in 1998. About two years ago, Sternin
and Fraser decided to revisit the premise once more, this time as a
musical comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Fraser and Sternin took turns describing the story: "It's a silly
comedy about a princess--she's the first liberated woman--and a noble
peasant named Sir Hansom Plotdevice who wants to be a knight. The man
the princess marries will succeed the king--but the king's conniving
trophy wife and his sniveling nephew will do whatever they need to
stop that from happening so they can come to power."</TE>
<TE>   Sternin sums up: "It's about true love conquering all, ultimately,
about good conquering evil. The fun of the show is that there are a
lot of things that were invented 500 years ago, only nobody knew it."</TE>
<TE>   After agreeing to compose "Knight Life," Barry promptly suggested
that his collaborators incorporate onstage musician-actors into the
story instead of using a traditional pit orchestra. The court
minstrel, for example, discovers rock 'n' roll after his lute is
electrified by a bolt of lightning during a storm.</TE>
<TE>   Barry took far more time coming up with the music. Sternin and
Fraser waited 11 months before hearing completed songs during a
staged reading in November. Said Fraser, "He was hatching but not
sharing." Barry: "I was absorbing it!" Sternin: "We panicked a
little." Barry: "Well, yeah, there was a deadline push, but the
longer you wait, the better it's going to be. It's an unconscious
thing. All of a sudden the melodies start to come.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like making a suit for somebody: You need to take the
dimensions and get the feel of it, how it's going to be used. It's
like the carpenter who came to our house said, 'Measure twice, cut
once,'" Barry continued. "I don't like to rewrite. I like to get it
all out the first time. And see, the way I created most of the songs
is I would become the character on stage and just start singing. It's
the most fun I've had in a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Barry tried his hand at a Broadway production in 1969, but "The
Freaking Out of Stephanie Blake" closed before it opened when its
star pulled out at the last minute. "[It was about] this Park Avenue
matron who goes to Greenwich Village in her pillbox hat to bring her
niece back home, but instead she freaks out and becomes a hippie,"
Barry said. "That was my last experience with creating for the stage.
This one I hope will have a happier ending."</TE>
<TE>   Sternin and Fraser had never written lyrics before, which
intrigued Barry. "Robert and Pru are wordsmiths, but what they create
is not necessarily in the form of songs," he said. "They just kind of
wrote with a loose structure, and part of my challenge was to not
necessarily mush it back into song form, but to create music that
would work in this odd structure, because the whole show is a little
out of the box--halfway between Mel Brooks and Monty Python. Our
director, Michael Michetti, totally got the irreverence, but
sometimes we had both feet out of the box and down the block, and
he'd say, 'That's a little too far out there.'"</TE>
<TE>   Michetti, a 1997 Ovation Award winner for directing "A Midsummer
Night's Dream" at the Stella Adler Theatre, came on board in
December. Michetti, who also staged Civic Light Opera of South Bay
Cities' production of "Titanic" and an Ovation-nominated Gold Coast
Plays' production of Stephen Sondheim's "Sweeney Todd," said, "My
first reaction to the material was clearly these were people who were
at the top of their game but different games than musical theater.
Their naivete about the form was an advantage in some ways because
their sensibility is so quirky. But there were also things, based on
my understanding of musical comedy, that needed to be reworked."</TE>
<TE>   Under Michetti's guidance, Sternin and Fraser restructured the
piece, replacing the quiet ballad that initially opened the show with
a big production number. And Barry, while casting the show, realized
that some of his melodies needed to sound a little more like
traditional show tunes.</TE>
<TE>   "I wished I had videotaped the auditions," he said. "I would have
edited the last note of each song--they all end on this high note,"
said Barry, throwing his arms out melodramatically. "They all ended
that way, whereas I was writing more pop, where you come down on the
end. So after days and days of auditions listening to hundreds of
people, you go, 'OK, at the end of the ballad, it can't be 'da da
da.' It has to be 'da da DAAAHHH.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not the tail wagging the dog," Barry concluded. "That's
adding the proper tail to the nutty dog. So that's what I learned:
Arms akimbo, high note."</TE>

<HD>Trumpeter Arturo Sandoval Takes to the Piano With a Tad Too
Much Passion</HD>
<DH>Jazz</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arturo Sandoval's credentials as a trumpeter and a jazz artist are
well established, his wider visibility enhanced by the biopic
featuring Andy Garcia as Sandoval. Less known, even though he
displays it fully in his live performances, has been his skill as a
jazz pianist. He finally has had a long-desired opportunity to
document that skill in a recorded outing.</LD>
<LD>   "My Passion for the Piano" (***, Columbia) is well titled. If
there is anything that bursts through the 12 far-ranging selections,
it is Sandoval's fascination with the instrument and with its
potential for personal expression.</LD>
<LD>   The first thing that needs to be noted about his playing is that
it is technically adroit, fully up to the virtuosic demands he
frequently makes of it. In fact, virtuosity is the keynote throughout
the album, with Sandoval rarely slowing down to play anything as
measured as simple eighth notes. Whipping through nonstop runs and
fast-paced scales and arpeggios, he seems determined to prove to any
doubters that he is up to the task of competing on piano at the same
high level at which he functions as a trumpeter.</LD>
<TE>   For the most part, he succeeds, most effectively with some of his
own material: "Romantico," "Marianela Says Goodbye" and "D.A.S.S."
But there also are passages in which he appears to be surprisingly
out of touch with the rhythmic flow--"Blues in F." And, despite the
awe generated by his sheer mechanical dexterity, there are times when
his musical effectiveness would have been enhanced by fewer notes and
a lot more open space.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, his live performances on piano often exhibit less
of a desire to prove his virtuosity in every measure. As good a
pianist as Sandoval is (especially given his extraordinary talents as
a trumpeter, a singer and a drummer), his passion for the piano would
be far more effective if he took a few more deep breaths.</TE>
<TE>   Although his piano work is almost universally admired among jazz
musicians, George Cables isn't heard as much as he should be. In
part, that may be because, at 57, he belongs to a kind of in-between
generation of jazz artists--too young to have participated in the
bebop glory days of the '50s, too old to be included among the
so-called "young lions" of the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   That said, however, Cables' resume is filled with major
engagements via performances or recordings with (among many others)
Freddie Hubbard, Art Blakey, Sonny Rollins, Art Pepper, Dexter Gordon
and Joe Henderson. Still, highly regarded though he may be as a
dependable rhythm section player, Cables rarely has had an
opportunity to display his wares as a composer/arranger.</TE>
<TE>   "Shared Secrets" (***1/2, MuseFX Records) solves that problem with
a program of music almost completely devoted to Cables' compositions.
(Originally released privately last year, it is now available in wide
distribution.)</TE>
<TE>   Although he has written for relatively small ensembles--never more
than eight pieces--with limited instrumentation, Cables has produced
a splendidly diverse set of works. In some cases (the unusual sounds
on "Phantom of the City" are a good example), he makes use of the
electronic Emulator to add textured layers. But he does so with an
obvious desire to retain as acoustic a quality as possible,
integrating the synthesized sounds smoothly into ensembles that
feature trumpet, saxophone, flute and rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   His pieces are well crafted and melodically appealing. One or two
have the accessibility of smooth jazz without paying the price of
musical simplicity. And his funky, revisionist version of "Let My
People Go," with Gary Bartz's insinuating alto saxophone upfront,
brings new life to this venerable song without diminishing its
importance as a social document.</TE>
<TE>   Equally important, Cables plays each of his instruments--from
acoustic and electric pianos to Emulator--with a feel for each of
their qualities. His marvelous electric piano solo on "Just Suppose"
defines the instrument as a jazz voice, and his fluent improvising
throughout make one wonder why this enormously talented artist
continues to labor in such relatively low visibility.</TE>
<TE>   The piano trio is one of the jazz world's essential chamber
ensembles, as vital and expressive within the genre as the string
quartet is for classical music. Pianists from Earl Hines and Bud
Powell to Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett have managed to find unique
ways to use it as a vehicle for improvisational expressiveness.</TE>
<TE>   The diversity present in the basic trio instrumentation--piano,
bass and drums--is noticeably apparent in two new recordings from two
very different players, Michel Camilo and Lynne Arriale. Although
they choose technically similar paths by emphasizing the connection
between piano and drums, and placing the bass in a more supportive
role, they come up with dramatically different results.</TE>
<TE>   Camilo, born in the Dominican Republic, was the winner of the best
Latin jazz album award (for his CD "Spain") at the first Grammy Latin
Awards in 2000. His "Triangulo" (***, Telarc Records), due March 26,
juxtaposes his fluent piano playing against the colorful drum set and
percussion work of Cuban-born Horacio "El Negro" Hernandez. The
results are stunning--impressively so in pieces such as "Mr.
C.I."--with their back-and-forth exchanges serving as the heart and
soul of the album. Anthony Jackson, a quintessential rhythm section
artist, takes a supportive role, which he handles with strength and
subtlety, as, so to speak, the wings beneath the Camilo-Hernandez
musical flights.</TE>
<TE>   Camilo's originals are typically tinged with body-moving Latin
qualities (check out his tribute to Tito Puente in "Descarga for
Tito"), and he adds a turbulently rhythmic version of Ernesto
Lecuona's classic "La Cumparsa" as well as an airy rendering of Dizzy
Gillespie's "Con Alma."</TE>
<TE>   As with Camilo, the nexus of Arriale's trio is her interplay with
a drummer, in this case, Steve Davis. The very first track of
"Inspiration" (***, TCB Montreux Jazz) makes that link crystal clear
via a percussive romp through Leonard Bernstein's "America." "It
Don't Mean a Thing," immediately following, is an even more appealing
version of the drums-piano alliance, simmering with an undercurrent
of sensual rhythm tinged with a slight touch of reggae. On yet
another exceptional track, loose, freely improvised segments of sound
and rhythm coalesce into Thelonious Monk's "Bemsha Swing," gradually
reconstructing the piece into a funk-energized groove.</TE>
<TE>   Arriale and Davis, along with bassist Jay Anderson (who gets the
opportunity to step out on his own in Lennon &amp; McCartney's
"Blackbird"), have been working on their musical togetherness for
years, and the resulting intuitive compatibility is obvious.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that long-term relationship, there are moments in which
Arriale's Evans-influenced harmonic style doesn't adapt well to the
constant drum presence. In ballads such as Keith Jarrett's "So
Tender" and "The Nearness of You," for example, Davis' cymbal ticks
and pops simply distract from Arriale's beautifully floating lines.
That caveat aside, Arriale, like Camilo, deserves praise for offering
yet another perspective into the seemingly infinite appeal of the
jazz piano trio.</TE>

<LD>Regardless of how elegant the design is, $200 million to $300 million
is a lot to spend on a curatorial whim, yet so far this is the only
argument the Los Angeles County Museum of Art has offered for
building a new museum ("Methodical Process, Radical Result," by
Suzanne Muchnic, March 3).</LD>
<LD>   As a LACMA member for several years now, I find the current
facility works better than ever with the recent improvements to the
plaza and park.</LD>
<LD>   It has its quirks, but is far more user-friendly than such mazes
as the Art Institute of Chicago, the Met or the Philadelphia Museum
of Art.</LD>
<TE>   Not that LACMA is asking for input from patrons (isn't this the
kind of thing that should be put to a vote?), but here's my two
cents' worth: Open the skylights in the Ahmanson Building and the
walled-up portals on the east and west sides of the atrium to let in
natural light as the original design intended. Next, build a new
parking structure on the vacant lot opposite the Anderson Building
with a pedestrian sky-bridge over Wilshire Boulevard, then tear down
the existing garage, close Ogden Drive and extend Hancock Park to
Fairfax Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Those are improvements that I'd donate money to.</TE>

<TE>   If LACMA director Andrea Rich says the five architects were asked
to join the museum's five buildings and three tried and failed, when
they decided on architect Rem Koolhaas' maquette, why weren't the
others given the chance to come up with a new building?</TE>
<TE>   Frank Gehry outright refused to do a remodel, but a whole new
building might have interested him.</TE>
<TE>   Why are there not three or four artists on the selection
committee?</TE>
<TE>   How are they going to expand the building in the future should
they acquire collections? MOMA went up. I don't see how you can add
floors on this plan.</TE>
<TE>   LACMA lost out on the Hammer, Simon, Gilbert and even the
Hirshhorn collections because the board of trustees was shortsighted.
This one is also.</TE>

<TE>   On July 29, 1992, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art said
goodbye to Earl Powell III, better known as Rusty or the man who had
made LACMA's stature rise.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a decade later, Andrea Rich is bringing LACMA beyond the
Powell years. Rich is positioning LACMA to surpass New York City's
art museums' collections and Chicago's old "architectural style"
museum buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Rich, along with MOCA and the Getty, has positioned Los Angeles to
become a world-class art center.</TE>

<TE>   As a 51-year-old native Angeleno, I have experienced much of what
is good and not so good about Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   While reading your piece on Rem Koolhaas' radical plan for LACMA,
I became aware of a breathless optimism gathering within my
being--filling me, and reminding me, that I too have a billowing
place filled with light and air and treasures. Brava to Andrea Rich
and all those who will make this dream a reality for the people of
Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   I applaud the committee's selection of Koolhaas' magnificent
vision for LACMA. It is long overdue, and will be an object of pride
and beauty for our city. But it doesn't quite go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese Pavilion has always been a visual thorn in the side
of LACMA, as evidenced in the aerial photo on Page 80. It is totally
out of harmony with the existing structure. How discordant it will be
juxtaposed with the new building is beyond comprehension.</TE>
<TE>   Why not include a plan to make the Japanese Pavilion more
artistically compatible with its new neighbor and still enable it to
retain its singular integrity?</TE>

<LD>Christopher Knight asks, "Which would you rather have: (a) a good art
collection housed in a lousy museum building, or (b) a good art
collection housed in a great museum building?" ("Art in a Proper
Setting," March 6).</LD>
<LD>   How about, (c) a museum whose board of trustees spends time and
money improving the collection, building up a relatively puny
endowment fund, and allocating only enough monies to capital
improvements so that the current hodgepodge look of the complex
(caused when structural changes dating to the 1980s weren't as
thorough as they should have been, undoubtedly due to the inability
of LACMA to raise a fraction of the millions and millions that the
Metropolitan, for example, gets for construction projects, not to
mention artworks, operations, etc.) is finally addressed.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that Edward Ruscha's "The Los Angeles County Museum on
Fire" is owned by one of the major art museums of Washington should
be a reminder that LACMA needs to spend precious time and finite
dollars on acquisitions, not knocking down and rebuilding its
galleries.</LD>

<TE>   Forgive the pun, but Rem Koolhaas' "translucent, tent-like roof"
for LACMA will result in a far from cool house in the summer. Has
anyone contemplated the hothouse effect of a plastic roof in Southern
California? What about the bankruptcy-inducing air-conditioning bill?
Koolhaas' design is ideal for a cloudy northern city. In perennially
sunny Los Angeles, it is wasteful and ecologically unsound.</TE>

<LD>For two weeks in a row, your writers have missed the perfect chance
to review a great new CD.</LD>
<LD>   Both Don Heckman ("Versatile Vocalists Who Shouldn't Be
Overlooked," Feb. 24) and Don Shirley ("Sometimes, the Good Songs Are
Preserved," March 3) should have got their hands on Susan Egan's new
CD. Titled "So Far . . ." and packed with show tunes, Egan's premiere
solo disc is breathtaking.</LD>
<LD>   Notwithstanding that I have no connection to Egan, and even though
the official release date was March 5, I was able to get an advance
copy of the album via her Web site. The disc has not left my player
yet. With songs from Andrew Lloyd Webber, Stephen Sondheim and
Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein, this collection is a must for theater lovers.
Egan's voice is flawless.</LD>

<HD>For His Film, You Really Have to Be There</HD>
<DH>One of a handful of site-specific documentaries, David
Vassar's 'The Spirit of Yosemite' screens only at the park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The lush imagery is almost hallucinogenic. The sounds, crisp and
vibrant, also make for a rich sensory experience. And for those
seeking a mini-history lesson, that's part of the mix too. In a mere
23 minutes, David Vassar's documentary film "The Spirit of Yosemite"
packs a powerful cinematic punch--but one that can only be
experienced at the park itself.</LD>
<LD>   Talk about exclusivity. Mainstream commercial filmmakers aren't
satisfied unless they cram the fruits of their labors into as many
theaters as possible. Many documentary filmmakers, meanwhile, are
happy to land brief runs in a handful of theaters before heading to
an afterlife on cable TV. Occasionally, however, filmmakers get a
genuinely unique assignment: a film that is intended primarily to be
shown in one specific location, indefinitely.</LD>
<LD>   "Spirit" was such an assignment for Los Angeles-born Vassar, who
shot the film in 36 days stretching over a two-year period so he
could capture the visceral changes of the four seasons.</LD>
<TE>   Produced by Greystone Films, it was commissioned by the Yosemite
Fund and the National Park Service, and recently won the award for
best non-broadcast program at the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film
Festival. Specifically made to introduce visitors to the splendors
and natural wonders within the park's 1,200 square miles, "Spirit"
was shot on 35-millimeter film and is presented on state-of-the-art,
high-definition digital video. Such high-tech visuals warrant the
optimum in acoustics, so it's no surprise that the accompanying
surround sound neatly completes the package. Indeed, the 131-seat
Yosemite Valley theater was renovated for the film, which premiered
last spring and has been screening up to 16 times daily since--and
will continue to do so for the next 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, Vassar made his first documentary at Yosemite, in
1970, when he was a student at Los Angeles City College. This led to
a summer job of presenting slide shows and evening programs to park
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "During my three summers" there, the filmmaker recalls, "I had the
opportunity to deepen my relationship with the park, which was one of
my intentions in making the film. You're going to learn a little
about the [history of] the park, but mostly it's the drama--like a
baptism--where your capillaries pop and you're open to the rhythms of
this vast, beautiful [land]."</TE>
<TE>   Vassar adds that he wants the visitor, after viewing the film, to
be in a receptive mode. "It's supposed to be a transcendental
experience, a meditation. It's a transitional device to actually
being in the park. It's nature. It's not Disney World--there wasn't
an art director."</TE>
<TE>   Vassar knows about art direction, at least in the commercial
arena. Though his curriculum vitae includes a Silver Hugo from the
Chicago International Film Festival for his multimedia production
"Replenish the Earth" and an Oscar nomination for his 1980
full-length documentary "Generation on the Wind," to pay the bills
Vassar worked for a number of seasons as a director of the television
series "Unsolved Mysteries." In addition, in 1995 he wrote, produced
and directed an episode for Time Life's "Lost Civilizations" on NBC,
with the series earning an Emmy.</TE>
<TE>   As for Yosemite, it's hardly a lost civilization. Abraham Lincoln
helped see to that. As Vassar's film recounts (he also wrote the
narration), while the Civil War was raging in 1864, the president
signed the Yosemite Grant for the express purpose of preserving and
protecting the park. Today some 4 million people visit annually. But
if you're one of those who haven't journeyed to the California
setting, it's likely that you may have gazed upon one of the many
photos that have captured the park's grandeur, especially those by
Ansel Adams.</TE>
<TE>   Adams' iconic imagery--including awesome shots of Half Dome and El
Capitan--actually posed a challenge to Vassar: How would he shoot
Yosemite in a new light?</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, Vassar and his director of photography,
Christopher Tufty, opted for a languid, hypnotic style. Particularly
memorable is the shot depicting the full tapestry of season changes,
beginning with a lone bird of spring and ending with the sublime
magnificence of a winter snowfall.</TE>
<TE>   "As a filmmaker, it's really nice to know that people are going
into a theater and you don't have to start off with a big bang,"
Vassar says. "In TV it's very formulaic. You have to get the show
going in the first 10 seconds or the [viewer] will flip the channel."</TE>
<TE>   With a budget of about $600,000, the director's work was a labor
of love. Shooting in Yosemite's back country required 21 mules to
move 2 tons of gear for the 12-person crew; helicopters were used for
aerial photography.</TE>
<TE>   Vassar has always been drawn to the great outdoors. In 1985 he
went to the Grand Canyon with saxophonist Paul Winter, and their
collaboration resulted in "Canyon Consort," a film portrait of the
musician made as the group rafted down the Colorado River. In July
1999, Vassar was one of three directors hired for the documentary
feature "Running on the Sun," a chronicle of the grueling marathon
that begins in Death Valley and ends 36 hours and 135 miles later on
Mt. Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   Although Vassar's niche may be the documenting of spectacular
settings, other filmmakers also make films for specific markets. Rhys
Thomas produced, wrote and directed a 22-minute film commissioned by
Nashville's Country Music Hall of Fame. It plays around the clock in
a continuous loop, also in a custom-built venue. Then there's the
granddaddy of documentary filmmakers, Charles Guggenheim, who is no
stranger to the niche concept.</TE>
<TE>   Guggenheim's Washington, D.C.-based Guggenheim Productions has
made hundreds of site-specific films, including documentaries about
Ellis Island and St. Louis' signature arch. The latter film, which
started screening in 1966 and still runs today, was nominated for an
Academy Award.</TE>
<TE>   Guggenheim, in fact, has been Oscar-nominated 12 times, winning
the statuette four times, most recently for 1995's "A Time for
Justice," the story of the civil rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Guggenheim produced a film for Pasadena's Norton
Simon Museum, with his son, Davis, directing. Made for $800,000, "The
Art of Norton Simon" includes shots of many works from the
industrialist's famous collection, among them Degas' best-known
sculpture, "The Little 14-Year-Old Dancer." There is also archival
footage, with one memorable scene showing the deal-loving Simon
making calls on a rotary phone. The 30-minute, 35-millimeter film
premiered in November 2000, and, according to the filmmaker, will run
indefinitely in the museum's 290-seat venue.</TE>
<TE>   "They put it in a first-class movie theater, and they tell me that
about 20% of the people who go to the museum see the film,"
Guggenheim says. "That's very good attendance."</TE>
<TE>   With these kinds of documentary films, you not only get to enjoy
the experience of a park, a museum or a hall of fame, but you can
prepare for the experience beforehand on celluloid or relive the
memory afterward.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, home videos and DVDs are also available for
purchase.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing quite takes the place of the real thing. Says Vassar:
"If you grew up in California, going to Yosemite was a rite of
passage. In the '90s, when the dot-commers were trekking to Nepal and
other exotic locations, they forgot that the most beautiful place on
Earth is just five hours from Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   As for the five weeks Vassar spent making his film, he notes
wryly, "It may [have been] a low day rate, but it was a day rate in
heaven."</TE>

<LD>At the Venice Film Festival last fall, director Alfonso Cuaron
screened his new movie, "Y Tu Mama Tambien" (And Your Mama Too),
about two teenage Mexican boys on a raucous road trip in search of
sex and adventure. A French journalist asked him why he made such a
superficial film when Mexico has so many overwhelming problems. Why
wasn't the crushing poverty and the social inequity addressed in the
film?</LD>
<LD>   The Mexican-born director's answer was typically blunt. "You are a
racist. You have the mentality of a classic liberal European. Your
own guilt is eased by creating a paternalistic view of what Latin
American film should be instead of seeing Latin America for what it
is--a very diverse society.... Why is it that when [Italian director
Michelangelo] Antonioni deals with issues of the so-called
bourgeoisie or when [Spanish director Luis] Bunuel does it, it's OK,
but if a Latin American uses characters from the upper or middle
classes we are considered sellouts and reactionaries?"</LD>
<TE>   Cuaron is a man with passion and a vision. His exchange of words
with the French journalist is just one of a number of justifications
he has had to make in defense of his film, which will be released in
U.S. theaters Friday. Not only did he have to break down stereotypes
about Mexico, but he also had to fight his countrymen when it came to
the rating of his sexually explicit picture. (In the U.S., the movie
is being released without a rating.) His battle with the Mexican
ratings board was one of many occasions on which the outspoken
director and the Mexican bureaucracy that oversees every aspect of
moviemaking--from funding to ratings to submitting movies for foreign
Oscar consideration--have clashed.</TE>
<TE>   And yet Cuaron says making "Tu Mama" was one of the most joyous
experiences he has had as a director. It put him back in touch
cinematically with his cultural roots after a decade in Hollywood
making such films as the critically acclaimed "A Little Princess"
(1995) and the disappointing "Great Expectations" (1998). It helps
that "Tu Mama" was a huge hit in Mexico. Perhaps most important, it
re-sparked the love of filmmaking he had lost.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like after 'Great Expectations' I was repeating myself,"
he says. "I needed to find my voice."</TE>
<TE>   Cuaron is one of a crop of Mexican directors--most between the
ages of 30 and 40--who have brought a new vibrancy to their nation's
cinema. They include Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, whose hard-charging
tale of violent, contemporary Mexico City, "Amores Perros," was
nominated for a foreign-language Oscar last year; Guillermo del Toro,
whose critically acclaimed "The Devil's Backbone," a horror story set
against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, was made in a
co-production of Spain and Mexico; and Salvador Carrasco, whose "The
Other Conquest," a historical epic about the Spanish conquest of
Mexico, made $1 million on a limited release in Los Angeles alone.
Their films have, in part, led Mexican audiences back into movie
theaters after a decades-long dry spell and opened Hollywood's eyes
to the talent south of the border.</TE>
<TE>   But Mexico is not alone in its brazen filmmaking. Directors in
Iran, Korea, Taiwan and Argentina, for instance, are also breaking
the mold with their stylish and bold movies. More than ever,
filmmakers who come from countries suffering through political or
economic turmoil are introducing the world to their stories. For
instance, Korean director Kang Je-Gyu's action thriller "Shiri,"
about a renegade group of North Korean commandos infiltrating South
Korea, was a No. 1 hit not only in Korea but also in Japan and Hong
Kong. Argentine director Juan Jose Campanella's Oscar-nominated "Son
of the Bride," a dramatic comedy about a man's relationships and his
inability to cope, typifies the kind of original filmmaking in that
country.</TE>
<TE>   These directors are not making your typical art-house fare.
Instead they are making entertaining, relevant and energetic films,
says MJ Peckos, president of First Look Pictures, one of the most
active distributors of independent and foreign films in the U.S. In
some ways, foreign filmmakers are filling the void left by
Hollywood's more formulaic movies, creating their own brand of
original and edgy material.</TE>
<TE>   "There certainly seem to be more countries turning out good
films," she says. "They are taking on issues that are contemporary
and important. I suppose it's people reacting to their environment
and making a statement and expressing themselves."</TE>
<TE>   "Y Tu Mama Tambien" began about 10 years ago with a flip
suggestion from Cuaron's closest friend, cinematographer Emmanuel
Lubezki ("Ali"): "What if we do a road movie about a couple of dudes
who go to the beach, dude?"</TE>
<TE>   Clumsy, full of bravado, clueless, tender, gross and, most of all,
horny, the teenage boy has long been the object of ridicule--and
affection--in such over-the-top comedies as "American Pie" and
"Porky's." Overheated teenage boys are at the heart of "Tu Mama," but
Cuaron had a different type of film in mind: He wanted to memorialize
those painful moments of self-discovery--most involving sex--that
mark adolescence. Indeed, Cuaron's graphic exploration of teenage sex
will no doubt shock many American moviegoers.</TE>
<TE>   And so "Tu Mama" began to come together as the story of two
teenage dudes, Julio and Tenoch, who take off to the beach with a
sexy older woman, Luisa, and find out a lot about themselves, their
friendship and sex along the way. The title comes from a Spanish
double-entendre used as an insult, similar to the expression "Yo'
mama."</TE>
<TE>   The idea floated in Cuaron's mind while he worked on other films,
such as his 1991 first feature, "Love in the Time of Hysteria," which
was not released in the U.S. but opened doors for him in Hollywood.
He continued making movies, this time in Hollywood with "A Little
Princess" and then "Great Expectations." But it was not until spring
1999 that Cuaron and his brother Carlos began writing "Tu Mama" in
earnest.</TE>
<TE>   The pair hunkered down in Cuaron's Manhattan apartment listening
to Frank Zappa's "Watermelon in Easter Hay" on an endless loop,
squirting squirrels with their garden hose and using Cuaron's
19-year-old son, Jonas, as a consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Like his films, the 40-year-old Cuaron has a youthful spirit. He
refuses to be trapped in societal conventions of adulthood. He has
lived in New York City for 10 years and still rents his apartment. He
despises wearing suits. He bristles at formality and becomes visibly
anxious when asked to hold a question-and-answer session for his
movie--he would prefer to make it casual, among friends, like college
buddies going out for coffee. He has an air of juvenile carelessness,
showing up for interviews with mussed hair, a soft gray cotton
sweater, gray nylon sweatpants and white Puma tennis shoes (an outfit
he wears two days in a row).</TE>
<TE>   "Losing your virginity is complicated," Cuaron said during a
recent visit to Los Angeles. "There is a great deal of idealization
that is usually shattered when the moment happens. It's like going to
Disneyland and figuring out that Mickey Mouse is really a guy in a
costume who is fed up because he is hot and he has to take another
stupid picture with another kid. You realize that magic is not that
magical."</TE>
<TE>   To be true to the story, Cuaron wanted the camera to act like an
omnipresent observer. As anyone who has seen teenage boys in action
knows, it isn't pretty. You see Julio and Tenoch (played by Gael
Garcia Bernal, who also starred in "Amores Perros," and Diego Luna)
in their element, getting high, masturbating, using profanity, having
sex with their girlfriends and learning the ropes with the older
woman, Spanish actress Maribel Verdu.</TE>
<TE>   The film's unapologetic take on teen sexuality begins from the
first act, with the opening scene showing a naked Luna in bed with
his girlfriend. She is going to Europe for the summer with her best
friend, and he is making her swear she won't have sex with "a smooth
Italian," a "hippie gringo," a "sissy Frenchman" or a
"huarache-wearing Mexican."</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican ratings board gave it a C--the equivalent of an NC-17.
Furious that the rating would shut out the very teenage audience
intended for the film, Cuaron sued. But the lawsuit is still pending,
and the film is already out on video. The rating did not seem to
affect the movie's success on the big screen.</TE>
<TE>   The film, which was released last spring in Mexico, brought 4
million moviegoers into the theaters (last year's Oscar-nominated
"Amores Perros" brought in 3 million) and raked in about $13 million.
It is now the second-highest-grossing Mexican film of all time, just
behind the 1999 hit "Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas" (Sex, Shame and Tears),
which grossed about $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Mexican Film Institute, only about 25 films a
year are produced in Mexico--and most of those are never seen in the
U.S., where getting distribution for foreign movies is an
increasingly difficult endeavor. Despite their successes in
international markets, Mexico's younger filmmakers seem to be at odds
with the aging bureaucracy that controls filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "They believe in a series of taboos that are remnants from the
'60s," says Cuaron, sipping on a glass of Evian water ("no ice, no
lemon, no gas--just as God intended"). "It goes something like this:
If you are entertaining, then you are superficial; if you are well
versed technically, then you must be a Hollywood wannabe; if you deal
with themes about the middle class, then you must be a bourgeois or a
reactionary; if you leave your country, you are a sellout."</TE>
<TE>   Cuaron's issues with the ratings board--that the ratings are
arbitrarily decided by a small committee of government appointees and
that it is unclear to filmmakers what criteria are used to decide on
a specific rating--are similar to complaints other filmmakers have
lodged with the entire Mexican filmmaking bureaucracy. Two years ago,
officials from the Mexican Film Institute were accused of sabotaging
the release of "La Ley de Herodes" (Herod's Law), a movie that darkly
satirized the corruption of the political party PRI. The film's
director, Luis Estrada, wrangled for months with the film institute
about buying his film back and releasing it independently.
Eventually, it was released, and it made a modest profit.</TE>
<TE>   Carrasco, director of "The Other Conquest," says he had to leave
Mexico because of the politics involved in making movies.</TE>
<TE>   "If you succeed here [in the U.S.], you tend to attract people
like a magnet. They want to be part of your success--not out of any
altruistic purpose but to benefit from it," says the director, who
now lives in Santa Monica with his family. "But in our countries, for
some complex reason that might have a lot to do with the scarred
psyche of colonization, success tends to ostracize you. I remember
when [novelist] Octavio Paz won the Nobel Prize and his effigy was
burnt in a public square in Mexico City."</TE>
<TE>   Cuaron had fought the same battles as Carrasco a decade earlier
with the release of "Love in the Time of Hysteria." Back then, he
accused the film institute leaders of corruption and ineptitude.
Because of his outspokenness, he says he burned his bridges in
Mexico. So he moved to New York and began making Hollywood movies.
Unfortunately, the complaints never seem to usher major change.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the first people to ever question or challenge the RTC
[radio, television and cinematography commission]," he says in
rapid-fire Spanish, referring to his recent lawsuit. "[In Mexico]
everybody lives in fear. When we filed our suit, we figured all the
liberals of Mexican society would back us. No one did. One senator
even said, 'Who cares? It's only film. We have bigger problems to
worry about.' And others said this was a publicity stunt. But I say
it's not about film or even one film, it's about freedom of
expression."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because of the controversy or because of its content, "Tu
Mama" was not submitted by the Mexican Academy as the country's
submission for foreign Oscar consideration. Instead, a little-known
film that, as of press time, did not have a U.S. distributor,
"Perfume de Violetas," was sent in. The move, seen as a slight by
some, follows a pattern in which the academy has, in the past, failed
to submit hits such as "The Other Conquest" or "Sexo, Pudor y
Lagrimas" for Oscar consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Cuaron believes Mexican filmmakers need to strike out on their
own, and that their reliance on government funding corrupts the
creative process and results in an unstable industry susceptible to
economic and political ups and downs. Unfortunately, he says, the
problems faced by Mexican filmmakers are similar to the challenges
other Latin American filmmakers face.</TE>
<TE>   "Latin American cinema needs to integrate itself into the
international scene," Cuaron says. "If we don't, it will continue to
be as fragile as it is. You will just continue to have individual
successes like Alejandro Gonzalez ['Amores Perros'], Memo [Guillermo]
del Toro ['The Devil's Backbone'], [Brazil's] Walter Salles ['Central
Station'] and Andrucha Waddington ['Me, You, Them']." He is hoping
Latin American filmmakers will unify as Asian filmmakers have; Korea,
China, Taiwan and Hong Kong are sharing directors, stars and stories
to create pan-Asian cinema. Cuaron says it's time for Latin Americans
to create a pan-American film industry.</TE>
<TE>   He has found a backer for his plan. Using capital from Mexican
millionaire and founder of Grupo Omnilife health products Jorge
Vergara, Cuaron founded Producciones Anhelo. They have also opened a
U.S. office under the name Monsoon Productions to produce movies in
Hollywood. "Tu Mama" was made solely with money from Anhelo and with
no help from the Mexican government. Cuaron says he was given
complete freedom in writing his script, with no strings attached to
the financing.</TE>
<TE>   The next two scheduled projects for Anhelo involve a Peruvian
director who lives in New York but will shoot in Mexico with a
Mexican cast, and a second film from Uruguay with a director who is
half Japanese. "This makes me so happy because it speaks to this
opening of borders--not even the opening but an erasing of borders,"
Cuaron says.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the challenges of making movies in countries with few
resources, entrenched bureaucracies hostile to young filmmakers and,
in some cases, outright government censorship, many filmmakers are
taking up their cameras and shooting contemporary stories that are
particular to their countries but universal in their appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Cheng-Sim Lim, a programmer who specializes in foreign film at
UCLA Film and Television Archive, says that for years, American
audiences have been missing out on some excellent foreign filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   This is partly because of U.S. distributors' lack of interest in
foreign films--and a lack of screens to show them on--but also
because of their Eurocentric perspective. Lim says this is changing
in the last few years, in part because of the rising popularity of
Asian films.</TE>
<TE>   For all his success and seriousness as a filmmaker, Cuaron remains
at heart a teenager, says the director's younger brother.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Alfonso has returned to his normal age," says
Carlos, 35. It helps that Cuaron has an exceptionally close
relationship with his son, who is now a freshman at Vassar. The two
are almost like brothers, with Jonas confiding in his father about
everything from girl troubles to drugs to an arrest once for jumping
over subway turnstiles.</TE>
<TE>   Cuaron alternately talks like a teenager and reverts to adult
mode.</TE>
<TE>   He is unmistakably from Mexico City's upper middle class, with
Mexico City slang such as "No seas guey" ("Don't be a jackass"), "Que
chido, mano" ("How cool, dude") and unprintable expressions often
flowing at the end of superbly phrased sentences.</TE>
<TE>   His directing style reflects his personality. He allows his actors
and crew a great deal of freedom--something so unusual in Hollywood
that "he scared people," says Mark Johnson, producer of "A Little
Princess."</TE>
<TE>   "I remember being in the bathroom and overhearing some of the crew
guys saying, 'The Mexicans have gone crazy on Stage 16,'" Johnson
recalls, laughing. "You see, Chivo [Lubezki] and Alfonso were
speaking Spanish, and nobody knew what they were doing. Some people
were worried that some of the stuff he was shooting would not work.
But I believed in him."</TE>
<TE>   On "Great Expectations," Cuaron was not so fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   "After 'Great Expectations' he was in a real funk," Johnson says.
"It just was not a good experience all around. After that movie he
said to me, 'I don't want to go do another big, elephantine movie. I
want to go off and get my hands dirty.'"</TE>
<TE>   "Tu Mama" was a cultural touchstone for Cuaron. He longed to write
with the richness of his native tongue and feel the familiarity of
the country he grew up in. The small, tightknit crew drove from
Mexico City, stopping in several small, poor towns as they wound
their way south to their destination on the beaches of Oaxaca. They
would film in the mornings and late afternoons, with long breaks when
they would play soccer and hang out on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The film was a family affair, with the Cuaron brothers and Lubezki
having known Garcia Bernal and Luna since they were babies. The
Cuaron brothers' nanny, who raised the boys and their two siblings
with their mother, has a cameo in the film as Luna's nanny. Cuaron's
father, a nuclear scientist, left the family when the boys were young
and doesn't keep in regular contact.</TE>
<TE>   Lubezki, who grew up in Mexico City with Cuaron and has worked on
all the director's movies, says his friend needed to return to where
he came from, cinematically and culturally.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the movie is the result of a lot of things that he
could not do in movies here," says Lubezki, who was nominated for
cinematography Oscars for "A Little Princess" and "Sleepy Hollow."
"[In 'Tu Mama'] he could do anything he wanted without having to
consult with anybody--no studio, no producer, nothing. It was a
totally freeing experience. He needed that. In 'Love in the Time of
Hysteria,' he tasted that fruit. And once you have tasted that
freedom it's hard to go back."</TE>
<TE>   Cuaron says "Tu Mama" was an important journey for him as a
filmmaker. Hollywood was starting to wear him down. Two years ago, at
a director's lab at the Sundance Institute, he found himself mentally
ridiculing the young filmmakers he was supposed to mentor.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'These guys--this is their first stupid movie. Soon
they will realize that making movies is about schmoozing, and it's
not all about enthusiasm,'" he says. "And suddenly I realized that I
had become jaded. I was really taken aback by the complete faith and
dedication these guys had about their work. That was when I said to
myself, 'I really need to reconnect with what my work is about.'"</TE>
<TE>   In the end, that reconnection probably paid off. "Tu Mama" was
nominated for a Golden Globe for best foreign film. At the Venice
Film Festival it won best screenplay and best emerging actor awards
for its two young stars. Johnson calls it "a Mexican 'Jules et Jim'
for the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   Cuaron admits that having tasted that sweet fruit of freedom,
maintaining his identity within the Hollywood moviemaking machine has
been challenging. His upcoming projects include "Children of Men" for
Universal, a futuristic thriller based on the novel by Tim Sexton.
Ideally, he would alternate making studio films in Hollywood and
indie films around the world.</TE>
<TE>   For filmmakers, Cuaron believes, globalization may not be such a
bad thing. "It is simply about being pragmatic. Rather than depending
on money from corrupt Latin American governments, you find your
financing from an international market." he says. "I think it is
vital for filmmakers to have their feet firmly planted in their
country's cultures. The color is very specific to that country--the
language, the feel of the movie. But the theme must be universal."</TE>

<HD>Surf and New Turf: A Sportswear Line Is Moving Into the
Record Business</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rock bands have been great marketing vehicles for clothes. Now a
clothing company is part of a plan to turn the tables.</LD>
<LD>   A new record label is being developed by associates of Costa
Mesa-based Hurley International, which since its 1998 founding has
been one of the top lines in the surf, skate and snowboard world and
highly visible in rock on the bodies of Blink-182 and other bands.
The record company is planned as a joint venture with Warner Bros.
Records, with the idea to use the market reach of the Hurley brand
and distribution as a launching pad for new acts.</LD>
<LD>   In part, the plan is to go beyond standard record retail outlets
and make the new label, which is still unnamed, a presence in stores
selling Hurley wear--a universe that last month expanded when the
company was acquired by Nike.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to use Hurley along with Warner Bros. to reach more
kids," says Jason Tappis, a former Hurley-sponsored professional
surfer who will head the label with Mike Piscitelli, a fashion
photographer and video director, and Hurley marketing director Paul
Gomez.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be able to do things like put ads on tags with the clothes
and even put interactive CD-ROMs on tags of some clothing so people
can hear a sample track or see a short clip of a band. Last year,
Hurley shipped $70-million worth clothes. If we can put even just a
little ad on some of the clothes, that's tons of publicity."</TE>
<TE>   Of course to do that, Hurley has to get bands to promote,
something that is still to come. But Warner Bros. Vice President of
A&amp;R Craig Aaronson, who is working on the venture, says that the
Hurley team is on the right track.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're really going to span genres, from punk to
hard-core to hip-hop and rock," Aaronson says. "They don't want to
pigeonhole themselves. The whole idea is for those guys to run the
company on their own and market on their own, and we're there to help
as things grow and can be brought to the major label system. It's our
opportunity to watch things grow at the retail level."</TE>
<TE>   As an example of the strength of that market, Aaronson mentions
the current rising profile of folk-flavored singer Jack Johnson,
whose debut album was originally sold primarily in surfwear boutique
shops and has now been picked up by Universal Records.</TE>
<TE>   Blink-182 manager Rick DeVoe notes that his band's association
with Hurley has benefited both parties.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul and [company founder] Bob Hurley are very smart and
definitely tapped into the whole music scene," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "It sets them apart from being just a regular surf company," he
continued. "We would go to shows and pull up and see kids wearing
Hurley shirts in Detroit, places where there's no [ocean] beach for
hundreds of miles. As far as the record label, they'll have great
distribution, so if they find a band out of San Diego or wherever,
they can start sending CDs out with the clothes to retailers and put
it on their Web site."</TE>
<TE>   ODD COUPLE: What would media goofball Adam Sandler and somber
musical prophet Dave Matthews have to talk about? Well, the first
time they met a few months ago, they found a common interest--hunting
small woodland creatures.</TE>
<TE>   "They talked about shooting beavers," says Bruce Flohr, the RCA
vice president of A&amp;R who works with the Dave Matthews Band. "In a
weird way they are the odd couple, but at the same time they're very
similar."</TE>
<TE>   The similarities paid off. The occasion of the meeting was a
private screening of Sandler's upcoming movie "Mr. Deeds," a remake
of the 1936 Frank Capra comedy "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town." After the
screening, Matthews and band agreed to provide a new song for the
film. "Where Are You Going" will be the first single from the movie's
soundtrack, which is due in May, with the film scheduled to premiere
in June.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Matthews and his band took pieces of the song and
wrote instrumental passages that will be used as part of the movie's
score. Although DMB songs have been used in films before, this is the
first original contribution to a movie soundtrack for the group.</TE>
<TE>   The song will also be featured on the band's next album, which is
being finished for a planned summer release.</TE>
<TE>   RED-HEADED FRIEND: An eclectic lineup is being put together for a
TV tribute to Willie Nelson, set to be taped April 14 at the Ryman
Auditorium in Nashville and to air May 6 on the A&amp;E cable channel.</TE>
<TE>   Acts confirmed to perform are Matthews, Matchbox Twenty's Rob
Thomas, Ryan Adams and Brian McKnight, along with country-related
artists Emmylou Harris, Lyle Lovett, Lee Ann Womack and Vince Gill,
all to be backed by Nashville resident Mark Knopfler and his band.
Thomas, Womack and McKnight sing with Nelson on his recent album,
"The Great Divide."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: A new Steve Earle song, "Some Dreams," will be
featured in the movie "The Rookie," which stars Dennis Quaid in the
fact-based tale of a 35-year-old college baseball coach who makes it
to the major leagues. The song will be the first single from a
soundtrack album, due March 26 from Hollywood Records, as well as a
cut on "Sidetracks," a collection of unreleased or rare Earle
recordings due April 9 from E Squared/Artemis Records. "Sidetracks"
also includes Earle versions of Nirvana's "Breed" and Bob Dylan's "My
Back Pages," plus songs he did for the films "The Horse Whisperer,"
"Dead Man Walking" and "Steal This Movie." ...</TE>
<TE>   Having sold out two nights at the small Troubadour their last time
in L.A., the White Stripes are moving up to three nights at the
900-capacity El Rey Theatre, May 31 and June 2-3, plus a June 1 date
at the Glass House in Pomona. Tickets for the Glass House go on sale
Thursday, and for the El Rey on Saturday.... The teaming of J Mascis,
Mike Watt and original Stooges members Ron and Scott Asheton will
record a live album of Stooges songs in a Saturday appearance at the
All Tomorrow's Parties festival at UCLA. Guest singers and other
artists playing the festival are expected to sit in.</TE>

<DH>Fittingly, a gay story about a woman who's straight is an
indie film shepherded by Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN RAUZI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a scene in the middle of "Kissing Jessica Stein" in which the
title character finally 'fesses up. Her best friend, about eight
months pregnant and fittingly impatient, has been grilling Jessica
for weeks about who she's been seeing. Jessica is cornered, squatting
on her sofa, so tightly sprung she's about to climb the bookcases.
She's got a throw pillow in a death grip when she spits out the truth:
She's been dating another woman.</LD>
<LD>   Are you freaked out? Horrified? she asks. Are you disgusted by me?</LD>
<LD>   "Are you kidding?" her friend responds, mouth agape. "I'm
impressed!"</LD>
<TE>   That is how the movie "Kissing Jessica Stein" works. It never
gives the answer you quite expect.</TE>
<TE>   The creation of two actresses who became writers, "Kissing Jessica
Stein" is something of a sheep in wolf's clothing. It's got a
low-budget, indie pedigree, to be sure. It was also groomed by
Hollywood and has the slick production values to match. It's being
distributed by Fox Searchlight, a company known for shepherding
idiosyncratic strays into the mainstream. In this case, it's a quirky
portrayal of how falling in love with the wrong woman can change your
life.</TE>
<TE>   "Kissing Jessica Stein" might have been controversial once, back
when two women kissing in an R-rated movie could still be considered
controversial. Maybe it'll still tweak the sensibilities of some
uptight folk--gay or straight--who go to movies looking to be
offended. There was, in fact, a moment during the gay film festival
Outfest last summer when things might have turned ugly. After a
screening, a woman asked writer-actresses Jennifer Westfeldt and
Heather Juergensen if they didn't see the danger in creating a
character who slips her sexual orientation off and back on like a
cardigan sweater.</TE>
<TE>   The two handled it with aplomb.</TE>
<TE>   "The gay women we talked to didn't identify with Jessica Stein,"
one of them said, "but they'd dated Jessica Stein."</TE>
<TE>   Tidy labels don't fit "Kissing Jessica Stein." Its stars,
Juergensen and Westfeldt, consider themselves actresses and writers.
Their characters dance up and down the continuum of
sexual orientation. The film itself is a gay movie about a character
who isn't gay. There isn't a pigeonhole big enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess they've just recently elongated the
gay-lesbian-bisexual-transgendered-and-questioning community. And
questioning!" lilts Westfeldt, cross-legged on a slipcovered chair in
her sunlight-filled Los Feliz apartment. "Did you not hear this? It's
de rigueur! You have to say, 'and questioning.'" she continues,
gesturing with a flip of her hand. "That, to me, is exactly what
we're talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Westfeldt has the look--and she knows it--of the quintessential TV
girlfriend, a lovely but uncomplicated face framed by thick,
amber-blond hair. After acting professionally since she was a teen in
regional theater, she slipped right into TV pilots when she moved to
Los Angeles in 1997. Casting agents found her perfect for the
understanding girlfriend from the Midwest or the ex-husband's new
love interest.</TE>
<TE>   Juergensen is striking in a different way: tall, dark hair, fair
skin, blue eyes. As a high schooler in Brooklyn, she had a thing for
acting but found the pursuit too daunting, until she faced a career
in advertising. She enrolled in acting classes and joined a theater
company in 1993, and eventually produced her own one-woman show,
"Letters to an Older Man."</TE>
<TE>   The two hit it off at a 1997 theater lab in the Catskills, the
kind that encourages getting things down on a page then up on a
stage. Westfeldt was supposed to start a recurring role (as a
girlfriend) on the ABC TV series "Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza
Place," but a six-week delay at its start gave the women a chance to
build on their momentum. Westfeldt came back to New York, they booked
six nights at a theater off-off-Broadway and started writing.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was an evening of scenes on the perils of dating. (Traces
of this survive in "Kissing Jessica Stein" as a two-minute montage.)
Among the characters were two straight women, fed up with men, who
meet in a day spa to negotiate becoming lovers. It was broad humor,
an over-the-top "what if" scenario. They got more and more interested
in that one kernel, but had to mount the play before they could
explore the deeper facets of that relationship. Says Juergensen, "We
all say what if, what if? But really, what if?"</TE>
<TE>   Still, that aspect of the show, called "Lipschtick," generated
immediate buzz and landed them meetings in Hollywood. As they started
to write a more focused movie script, they knew one thing: They
weren't giving up the roles that got them the attention. Jessica
(Westfeldt) is a frustrated artist who feels deeply alone, in a
hysterical, high-strung way. Helen (Juergensen) is a downtown
Manhattan hipster whose nonchalance about her bi-curiosity belies a
dissatisfaction with her relationships. "We created these characters
as actresses, and we identified with them so much," Juergensen says.
"You just don't want to give that to someone else."</TE>
<TE>   The script was quickly optioned by Interscope. The whole Hollywood
development process--the antithesis of "get it on the page and up on
the stage"--was a crash course in movie structure, screenwriting,
marketing. Westfeldt nods toward her computer and jokes about 300
different versions of the story; and then it seems she isn't really
exaggerating. Adds Juergensen, "It was like dog years." It came down
to this: Interscope wanted to make a Hollywood comedy, something like
"In &amp; Out." The director--actor-director Saul Rubinek ("Jerry and
Tom") was attached at the time--wanted a more edgy, art-house
approach. The women wanted it both ways. Can't we retain the
accessible comedy, but keep the un-Hollywood ending and the other
quirky elements? they asked.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'Yeah, that's called a 'tweener,' and we don't want to
make that movie," recalls Juergensen. "'That makes us nervous because
the theory is you lose both audiences.'"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, you could get both audiences--the indie movie lovers
and the mainstream comedy crowd. "The Full Monty" (1997) did it, for
instance, as Westfeldt was reminded each morning as she drove onto
the Fox lot. "Every day there was this banner for 'The Full Monty'
that said '"The Full Monty" has now made $200 million!' Every day I'd
come in and the number, like at McDonald's, would be changing."</TE>
<TE>   "The Full Monty" became their inspiration. It proved that a
laugh-out-loud comedy doesn't need a big budget and that a strong
story doesn't depend on stars. And it proved that comedy and
poignancy could peacefully coexist.</TE>
<TE>   But to pull a "Full Monty," Westfeldt and Juergensen needed to
find the right relationship.</TE>
<TE>   When Interscope's option on "Lipschtick" expired in 1999, the
rebound girl was practically living next door. Eden Wurmfeld, who'd
been the production manager on the indie hit "Swingers" (1996) and
produced "See Jane Run" (2000), had known Westfeldt since their early
20s and, coincidentally, was living just down the street in the
Fairfax district.</TE>
<TE>   She'd read the various drafts of the stage play and the script,
and loved the story.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like when you secretly have a crush on someone, but you
don't want them to know," Wurmfeld says. "They were at the studio;
they were married to someone else."</TE>
<TE>   The missing piece was a director, someone who could drop the
auteur mantle to collaborate with Westfeldt and Juergensen--there
would be no throwing the writers off the set in this production. That
ruled out a lot of people. Plus, directors who'd made indie hits
weren't interested in shooting a $700,000 movie for no pay anymore.</TE>
<TE>   The man for the job, it turned out, had been sleeping on
Wurmfeld's couch: Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, her brother, a film and
theater director who is also a serious student of acting.</TE>
<TE>   For him, "Kissing Jessica Stein" as a big opportunity with deep
personal resonance. When he was 21, he fell in love with his best
friend, a man who ended the relationship six months later because he
wasn't gay. That was just the beginning of a rocky coming out, during
which he took his mother's maiden name after a falling out with his
father. (Rifts healed, and he now uses both names.)</TE>
<TE>   While Juergensen and Westfeldt had done a lot of interviews,
Herman-Wurmfeld drew on experience. He advocated for the new title as
Jessica evolved into the clear protagonist. He helped shape Helen's
character and the arc of the relationship. An early scene shows Helen
snort down a stiff drink after a quick sexual encounter with a man.
And at the end, it's Helen who demands more of the relationship than
Jessica can really give.</TE>
<TE>   "The conscious choice for us was not just to tell one story, but
hopefully many," Westfeldt says. "If the women did end up together,
it would be like: two women who start out at the top of the movie
seemingly straight, try this experiment for all the wrong reasons,
and both have the exact same revelation at the exact same moment."
Instead, the ending is left somewhat open. There is a suggestion that
Jessica may rekindle a relationship with an ex-boyfriend, Josh (Scott
Cohen). But there are those, Herman-Wurmfeld says, who read the tale
as her first step in a longer coming out.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Kelley, director of programming for Outfest, said "Kissing
Jessica Stein" gets beyond girl-meets-girl. There's been a push to
establish a lesbian identity in American films, he said, but "Kissing
Jessica Stein" shows that "we've come to a point where the culture is
established enough to play around with it."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly the archetype of movie lesbians has been at best
humorless and more often tragic. The string of ruined lives that
began with "The Children's Hour" (1961) still hasn't ended if
"Mulholland Drive" (2001) is any indication. Even characters who find
lasting love are subject to prescribed amounts of suffering, as in
the critically acclaimed "Aimee &amp; Jaguar" (1999) or "All Over Me"
(1996).</TE>
<TE>   But while Helen and Jessica don't remain lovers, they're not left
damaged. In the end, Jessica has become a little gay for a period of
her life, and she's much better for it. "Each of them is shattered
and reassembled," Kelley notes. "But it's the fact that they're
reassembled that makes it different from other films."</TE>
<TE>   The film drew near unanimous praise at film festivals around the
country, including the Chicago International Film Festival and Jewish
film festivals in Boston and Louisville, Ky. Last month it won the
Audience Award at the Miami Film Festival. When it played the Los
Angeles Film Festival last April, Variety's Lael Loewenstein wrote in
her review, "A fresh take on sex and the single girl, this buoyant,
well-crafted romantic comedy blends pitch-perfect performances with
deliciously smart writing."</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles festival, it won the Audience Award for best
feature film, a special jury award for acting and writing, and the
biggest prize of all: a distributor.</TE>
<TE>   The "power breakfast"--as Herman-Wurmfeld still has it recorded in
his Palm Pilot--was at an outdoor cafe at a Century City hotel. He
and the writers and a film broker sat around a huge round table with
executives from Fox Searchlight, the company that had distributed
"The Full Monty."</TE>
<TE>   "It was like sending your child to boarding school," he said. "You
want to make sure the teachers are smart and sensitive and understand
your kid. You want to ask all the right questions, but you don't want
to offend them in any way."</TE>
<TE>   Westfeldt and Juergensen were excited but wary. They'd met with
other studios that had wanted to tinker with the film for theatrical
release.</TE>
<TE>   Softly but directly, Westfeldt asked Fox Searchlight
President Peter Rice: "So what do you foresee having to change in this
film?"</TE>
<TE>   Recalling his answer, Westfeldt impersonates Rice's confident
voice, his clipped British accent: "We will release this film,
literally, as is."</TE>
<TE>   The few things about the film that changed largely did because the
world changed around it. Nine skyline shots of New York were replaced
after Sept. 11. The film screened at the Toronto International Film
Festival only days after the terrorist attacks, and it was evident
that the shots were causing the audience to drop out of the story.</TE>
<TE>   They substituted shots that were more specific to their
story--ones of Chelsea, where Helen works at a gallery, or of Central
Park, where Jessica goes running. The new shots, like "Kissing
Jessica Stein" as a whole, capture a carefree energy and optimism
that are less evident in New York now, says director Herman-Wurmfeld.
For him, the film is "the last piece of a moment in time in New
York."</TE>
<TE>   But there's a certain kismet in the changes too. In one of the
shots they added, a taxi is driving past. On its side is a sign
advertising a new Broadway musical, "The Full Monty."</TE>

<LD>EELS</LD>
<LD>   "Souljacker"</LD>
<LD>   DreamWorks</LD>
<TE>   ****</TE>
<TE>   Eels frontman E (a.k.a. Los Angeles' Mark Oliver Everett) makes
viscerally melodic music that matches his emotionally intense
ruminations. Sometimes the results are quite accessible (1998's
"Electro-Shock Blues"), other times more introverted (2000's "Daisies
of the Galaxy"). This time, E has balanced the slip-slamming appeal
of the group's first radio hit, "Novocaine for the Soul," with an
idea nearly as sobering as the death musings of "Electro-Shock
Blues."</TE>
<TE>   According to E's message on Eels' official Web site, "Souljacker"
(due in stores Tuesday) stems from his thought that if you fail to
appreciate your soul, you could have it stolen and not even notice
it's gone. "I then realized that no one can take your soul if you
know what you have and you don't want them to," he writes. He
explores this idea from two viewpoints, in "Souljacker Part I," a
vaguely Doors-feeling number about a soulless life, and "Souljacker
Part II," a driftier tune in which a potential victim stands his
ground.</TE>
<TE>   These dozen vignettes tell odd tales that range from bleak to
chilling to weirdly uplifting, but the music is the innovative icing
on the cake. "Jungle Telegraph" blends thumping dance beats with
folk-blues elements a la Moby, and contributions from PJ Harvey
collaborators (John Parish co-produces and plays several instruments,
and guitarist Joe Gore appears on some tracks) enhance the essence of
Eels' fragmented fusion of hip-hop, rock and folk, while recalling
the lush/stark melodies on Harvey's last album.</TE>
<TE>   Yet E is his own man, and this unique collection is the closest to
perfection a rock record has reached so far in the young year.</TE>

<TE>   ELY GUERRA</TE>
<TE>   "Lotofire"</TE>
<TE>   Higher Octave/Virgin</TE>
<TE>   This brooding work (due Tuesday) marks the U.S. album debut by a
moody Mexican singer-songwriter considered a leading light of Latin
alternative music. Recorded in New York and originally released to
critical acclaim by EMI Mexico in 1999, "Lotofire" has been remixed
and repackaged with an extra song. The original 10 are written or
co-written by Guerra along with Venezuelan producer Andres Levin.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with the full-throttle melodrama of many Mexican pop
artists, Guerra is the anti-singer. Understated, breathy and
ethereal, her voice floats like incense over hypnotic electronica and
muffled trip-hop beats. She sings as if Spanish had no accents,
emitting syllables with a new-age detachment that can seem cold and
disembodied at first. A novice listener feels the fire underneath
only by lingering.</TE>
<TE>   Influenced by Peter Gabriel and compared to PJ Harvey, Guerra
creates a mystical stillness with her lone voice and solo guitar in
the prayer-like "El Mar" (The Sea). On "Vete" (Go Away), she speaks
for Mexico's exploited Indians with a steely resolve driven by
ritually escalating rhythms. And in the insistent "Yo No" (Not Me),
she demands respect as a woman.</TE>
<TE>   This remarkable collection requires time and meditation to
appreciate. The reward is discovering a world-class artist.</TE>
<TE>   --Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   N.E.R.D.</TE>
<TE>   "In Search Of ... "</TE>
<TE>   Virgin</TE>
<TE>   As the in-demand production team the Neptunes, Pharrell Williams
and Chad Hugo have tended to build hip-hop hits around hard,
in-your-face hooks that aren't easily forgotten. One thinks of the
clipped guitar figure that loops through Britney Spears' "I'm a Slave
4 U" or the sing-along chorus that chirps up Ol' Dirty Bastard's "Got
Your Money." For their debut album (due Tuesday) as the band
N.E.R.D., Williams, Hugo and third member Shay work that same
stratagem across 12 tracks.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second draft of the album. The first, made with drum
machines and samples, was scotched in favor of the live
instrumentation found here. It was good move--the warm guitars and
keyboards give "In Search Of ... " a sonic expansiveness that is all
too rare in hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   The overall tone is playful but pointed. Ebullient grooves that
owe as much to '80s new wave and garage rock as they do hip-hop
underscore lyrics about corrupt politicians, drug addicts and risque
role-playing. Williams and Hugo think a few thematic levels above
most rap artists--songs such as "Brain" and "Provider" alternately
mock and celebrate the big pimping life, while "Rock Star" decries
the plastic personae of celebrities. The most venturesome hip-hop
album in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   --Marc Weingarten</TE>
<TE>   **1/2</TE>
<TE>   BRANDY</TE>
<TE>   "Full Moon"</TE>
<TE>   Atlantic</TE>
<TE>   At age 23, singer-actress Brandy is all grown up--married to
producer Robert Smith, pregnant with her first child and offering
some sadder-wiser views of romance on her third album. Yet her
maturing voice, though inviting and more resonant, isn't the star of
this show.</TE>
<TE>   That would be producer-writer Rodney Jerkins. The principal figure
behind her previous collection, 1998's "Never Say Never," handles
most of the "Full Moon" tracks as well, and he has a singular way of
texturizing a track. Here he crafts conventional sentiments into
unusual shapes by blending wide-open space, angular beats and a toy
box full of bleeps, beeps and buzzes, resulting in such
innovative-sounding numbers as "I Thought," a squishy electro-funk
dissection of a bad romance, and the stark, shambling, accusation
"What About Us?"</TE>
<TE>   In addition to standing up for herself against a hyper-critical
lover in "Apart," Brandy unleashes her sexuality in such do-me-baby
numbers as "When You Touch Me," which evokes old-school quiet storm
with its tingly keyboards and breathy yearning. But she also
celebrates meeting the Right One with the giddily romantic "He Is."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the variety of moods, "Full Moon" feels overlong at 73
minutes, and the music is so electronic it starts to feel mechanical,
despite Jerkins' sonic brainstorms. Brandy's vocals are quite
agreeable but lack character, and not even this clever producer could
completely compensate for that.</TE>
<TE>   -- N.N.</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Brendan Benson, "Lapalco," Star Time. "Folk Singer," which
appeared on last year's International Pop Overthrow festival
compilation, portended great things for this Michigan native's first
album since "One Mississippi" in 1996. Benson--with the indefatigable
Jason Falkner as collaborator on five tracks--does not disappoint,
employing glistening harmonies, subtle production flourishes, and
unexpected stops and starts to apply a shine and a smile to his
charmingly self-effacing power pop.</TE>
<TE>   --Kevin Bronson</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Killa Beez, "The Sting," KOCH/In the Paint. The second
installment of this Wu-Tang Clan-fronted offshoot project (in stores
Tuesday) demonstrates the polarized ends of the Wu-Tang's musical
spectrum. Strong, clever, vivid raps from members Method Man and
Inspectah Deck anchor the edgy collection, but are sandwiched between
pedestrian offerings from the group's auxiliary B-level and C-level
artists. This "Sting" isn't as piercing as it could have been. Soren
Baker</TE>
<TE>   Freddy Fender, "La Musica de Baldemar Huerta," Back Porch/Virgin.
The 64-year-old Tex-Mex icon, known best for country hits such as
"Wasted Days and Wasted Nights," just won his first Grammy as a
soloist for this routine collection of Latin American standards.
Originally released on his own label last year and reissued last
month, the album retains a low-budget, homemade feel. Sadly, Fender's
triumph comes at a time when age and illness have ravaged his voice,
making it especially painful to hear the shaky reprise of his No. 1
pop hit from 1975, "Before the Next Teardrop Falls."</TE>

<HD>Drug Firms Trying to Ease Doubts of Investors</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Has a disease hit the renowned pharmaceutical industry?</LD>
<LD>   Respected companies are drawing doubts and questions. Merck &amp; Co.,
a leading firm with a reputation for strong scientific research and
financial returns, has hit a lean patch with few new drugs and no
growth in earnings. Its stock is down 33% in the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. is being judged foolish for investing $2
billion in ImClone Systems Inc., a small company with a promising
cancer drug that couldn't handle the intricate process of applying
for drug approvals with the Food and Drug Administration. Bristol-</LD>
<TE>   Myers' management has stepped</TE>
<TE>   in to rectify matters, but the company's stock is still down 20%
from its high of last year.</TE>
<TE>   What's going on?</TE>
<TE>   A crucial industry is demonstrating just how difficult
technological and financial success can be to maintain. It now
requires investment of $800 million on average to develop a major
drug. So stock market values are particularly important to drug
companies. They require enormous capital to finance the research and
clinical trials that go into drug development. A relatively low stock
price can force even the strongest firms to take short-term actions
that lead to long-term regrets.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the drug industry today is merging into larger firms,
operating from headquarters in the United States and Europe. Size is
needed for the ability to keep a continuing stream of new drugs
coming to market as other drugs go off patent.</TE>
<TE>   Patent protection on a prescription drug lasts for 17 years but
dates from a midpoint in the drug's research, so the average drug has
about 12 years of patent-protected earning in the marketplace, Merck
Chairman Raymond Gilmartin said recently in a speech.</TE>
<TE>   Merck today offers a particularly clear example of the
crosscurrents of modern medicine and modern capital markets.
Gilmartin has told investment analysts that after a decade in which
Merck's earnings growth averaged 16% a year, profit in 2002 would be
flat with last year--about $7 billion, or $3.14 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Merck has half a dozen of its most important drugs going off
patent, including the high blood pressure medicine Mevacor and the
ulcer drug Prilosec. Once patents expire, generic, cheaper versions
of the drugs hit the market and Merck makes little profit from them.</TE>
<TE>   A single major drug can support a global business by itself.
Merck's anti-cholesterol drug Zocor, for example, will have about $7
billion in worldwide sales this year. But it goes off patent in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Merck's problem is that for the next few years, it has no major
drugs coming along to replace the others. A drug it counted on, the
arthritis remedy Vioxx, is not delivering the sales anticipated and
has run into problems involving side effects.</TE>
<TE>   At times like this, companies often seek a merger, says analyst
Bob Kirby of investment firm Edward Jones &amp; Co. But not Merck.
Resisting Wall Street suggestions that it merge with</TE>
<TE>   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. or acquire Schering-Plough Corp., Merck's
executives say the company will be better off on its own, pointing to
its research and development.</TE>
<TE>   The company is certainly not cutting back. Merck this year will
spend $2.9 billion on R&amp;D, a 16% increase from 2001, and $2.5 billion
more on development of laboratories and other facilities for
research.</TE>
<TE>   A major part of Merck's research is pursuing brain and
nervous-system medicines, including drugs to alleviate the effects of
Alzheimer's disease, and new forms of tranquilizing and
antidepressant drugs. The company promises to introduce 11 major new
drugs by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   It planned ahead. In 1999, Merck paid $80 million to acquire Sibia
Neurosciences, a San Diego start-up that has become the nucleus of a
Merck research center in La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, scientific work continues on vaccines against AIDS and
medicines to help chemotherapy patients and asthma sufferers.</TE>
<TE>   Will the financial markets support all that research and
investment?</TE>
<TE>   "Probably they will, based on Merck's track record in drug
development," says analyst Mark Ravera of Mehta Partners, a New York
research firm that specializes in the global drug industry.</TE>
<TE>   And Merck may make a move or two to bolster its stock price. The
company announced recently that it would sell part of its Medco
division, which manages prescription costs for hospitals, in a public
offering and spin the rest of the division off to shareholders. The
Medco spinoff would bring in cash and leave Merck a
pharmaceuticals-only firm, which Wall Street analysts favor.</TE>
<TE>   And it could open the way for Merck to acquire Schering-Plough,
with which it already is pursuing joint research on anti-cholesterol
and arthritis medicines, says analyst Michael Krensavage of
investment firm Raymond James &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   "That kind of heavy petting often leads to more," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But why would Merck acquire Schering-Plough, which has</TE>
<TE>   $10 billion in annual sales, when it has said it feels no need to
merge? Because a merger could come in handy to bolster the stock
price if research on some of its new drugs hits a wall.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts recall that Pfizer Inc. three years ago said it had no
intention of merging but then fought off competitors to acquire
Warner-Lambert Co. and get full control of its Lipitor drug, the
leading cholesterol-reducing medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers, which is pursuing research on cancer drugs in its
own laboratories, may have felt the need to shore up its capabilities
in oncology by acquiring an interest in ImClone's Erbitux drug, which
may be able to shrink colorectal tumors.</TE>
<TE>   The need to balance the demands of science and finance is
critical.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a high-risk, high-growth industry and so investors demand
high returns," says analyst Kirby of Edward Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Successful companies such as Merck and Pfizer typically return 30%
to 40% a year on capital invested, among the highest rates  of profit
in U.S. industry.</TE>
<TE>   In recent decades, drug firms have earned those high rates of
return by developing drugs to alleviate heart disease, multiple
sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and other illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   But financial markets are impatient taskmasters and react with
alarm at any sign of faltering in the rates of financial returns or
scientific discovery. That's why Merck is scrambling to quell today's
doubts and fulfill tomorrow's promises.</TE>

<HD>Japan's Deposit Insurance Cap Adds to Weary Nation's
Financial Woes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>For Yoshihisa Watanabe, a Buddhist priest from Gunma prefecture, the
material world is looking a whole lot riskier these days.</LD>
<LD>   On April 1, the government will limit its liability for
certificates of deposit to $77,000 if the bank fails. A year later,
it will apply the same cap to ordinary savings accounts. Japan
currently offers full state protection of deposits.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm so worried that I'm beside myself," Watanabe said. "I'm
responsible for our temple's finances--several hundred thousands of
dollars worth built up over many generations--and just don't
understand why the government has to do this now."</LD>
<TE>   Watanabe isn't the only one. Corporate officers, local officials,
association heads and rich individuals across Japan are questioning
the logic even as they shift more money into gold, postal savings
accounts, government bonds and other safe havens.</TE>
<TE>   The United States capped federal deposit insurance at $100,000 per
account in the 1970s without too much difficulty. Japan also
maintained a $77,000 limit until the beginning of its "Big Bang"
financial deregulation in mid-1996 when the government decided to
provide an added degree of security.</TE>
<TE>   What's different now, however, is diminished confidence by the
Japanese that their local bank or credit union will be around given
the ballooning of bad debt.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts warn that a botched deposit insurance transition could
prompt a run on weaker banks or even trigger a financial crisis.</TE>
<TE>   At a more fundamental level, the insurance cap represents one more
sign--along with rising medical costs, a faltering pension system,
higher unemployment and more corporate bankruptcies--that Japan's
cradle-to-grave social system is coming off its tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a growing recognition nowadays that they must look out
for themselves," said Yoshimasa Nishimura, professor at Waseda
University in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   When the insurance cap was imposed on U.S. accounts, most people
with more than $100,000 divided their savings into smaller chunks or
rearranged it to better protect it. Japanese savers appear to be
doing the same. Time deposit funds fell 4.8% in December, the largest
decline since record keeping started in 1968. Ordinary accounts
surged by 15.8%, according to the Bank of Japan.</TE>
<TE>   What's disconcerting for many consumers, however, is the lack of
public information about the health of individual Japanese financial
institutions, which can make it more difficult to judge them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It May Be Difficult to Slice Up Nest Eggs</TE>
<TE>   Another key difference is the lack of financial alternatives in
Japan. U.S. companies, municipalities and nonprofits can park funds
in money market accounts, municipal bonds, mutual funds or other
options.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, banks and post offices are the main show, with interest
rates in this deflationary economy often less than 20 cents per $100
annually. Toshiba Corp., concerned about the insurance cap, recently
has paid down some debt but still keeps $2.9 billion in local bank
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The concentration of banks in Tokyo and Osaka also can make it
difficult to cut those nest eggs into enough slices.</TE>
<TE>   Only three financial institutions maintain branches near
Watanabe's Enkyo Temple. In theory, he could deposit money in Tokyo,
but it's important to support local financial institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Archaic industry practices limit Internet transfers, check use and
even ATM withdrawals at night or on weekends, denying the religious
order access to its funds.</TE>
<TE>   Financiers note a significant flow of funds into postal savings
accounts, considered safer bets than banks. Although these accounts
soon will see a $77,000 insurance cap, a so-called settlement account
still will offer unlimited protection.</TE>
<TE>   "The bankers and politicians scratch each other's backs so I don't
trust banks anymore," said Toshitaka Okamoto, a 39-year-old worker.
"I'm keeping most of my money in the post office."</TE>
<TE>   In theory, as bankers and credit association managers lose the
security of government bailouts, they're more likely to handle
capital prudently, reducing waste and mismanagement.</TE>
<TE>   Local governments find themselves in a particular bind given the
often huge sums in their accounts. Municipalities currently hold $153
billion in bank deposits nationwide, or $47 million on average per
town. A seminar held by Shiga prefecture recently to educate
bureaucrats on the changes was overwhelmed when 250 people showed up
for 40 seats.</TE>
<TE>   Outspoken Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara recently announced plans to
publicly rate banks the capital city uses and to withdraw portions of
its $9.2 billion in accounts from weaker players. The threat has
turned heads in a culture in which clearly distinguishing winners
from losers is considered bad form. "The Tokyo government has no
intention of going down together with [collapsing] banks," Ishihara
told reporters last month.</TE>
<TE>   The result of all this, analysts say, is that funds probably will
be concentrated in large city banks and strong regional institutions,
which already have more cash than they can lend.</TE>
<TE>   Second-tier regional banks and credit unions have seen their
deposits fall by 1.6% and 9.5%, respectively. In just one example,
Nihon University recently announced plans to switch much of the $923
million it collects annually in tuition into four large banks from 30
smaller institutions it's been using.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Multiple Bank Failures Could Tax System</TE>
<TE>   The deposit insurance system holds $115 billion, which some see as
woefully inadequate should a few major institutions fail
simultaneously. Forty-six small cooperatives failed last year as
regulators stepped up their inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Michiyasu Hirao, a director with the Mitsui Strategic Studies
Institute, a think tank, sees less danger of a bank failure from
individual depositors than by other banks withdrawing huge sums.</TE>

<TE>   Despite the growing fears of bank defaults, most analysts believe
the Japanese government will pay off accounts no matter the

<TE>   Stockbrokers also hope the change will force notoriously
risk-averse Japanese investors to put more of their $10.8 trillion in
personal savings into equities and other more adventurous
investments.</TE>
<TE>   After several false dawns, however, most aren't holding their
breath. "At this stage, we can't really see any sign of it," said
Garry Evans, HSBC Securities' strategist.</TE>
<TE>   Even generally safe corporate bond funds have been discredited
after the bankruptcy of Enron Corp. and Japanese retailer Mycal Corp.
In fact, there's evidence investors are moving in the other
direction, given a recent mini-gold rush and a sharp hike in
government bond purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Tanaka Precious Metal Jewelry Co. in Tokyo saw a fourfold jump in
gold sales in January pegged in part to bank worries, with a few
customers buying as many as 40 gold bars at $10,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   During the first three weeks of December, Japanese overall bought
20 tons of the precious metal, a 54% jump from year-earlier levels,
according to the World Gold Council.</TE>
<TE>   Yuji Watanabe, a 66-year-old retired railway employee, who is not
related to Yoshihisa Watanabe, emerged from Tanaka Precious Metal's

<TE>   "I'm terribly worried about the future given the state of Japan's
banking system," he said. "I don't want to lose my money after all
the sweat and blood it took to save it."</TE>
<TE>   "Who would have imagined Japan would find itself in such bad shape
now," he said before heading off with a worried look.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Petruno told it like it is ["Finding Stocks' True Value," Market
Beat, Feb. 24].</LD>
<LD>   He described how a major source of misinformation, or at least
obfuscation, in reporting true profits is associated with corporate
stock options. His quote from investor Warren Buffett was
particularly apt. He went on to explain that stock options became
popular because "investors didn't want bigger dividends because of
the tax bite."</LD>
<LD>   Thus he has shown how lowering capital gains taxes relative to
other sources of income has distorted the market and led to abuses.
It is interesting that the public has been brainwashed by scores of
highly paid economists into believing that money derived from labor
or interest is not used beneficially in the economy, but that capital
gains are.</LD>
<TE>   In other words, profit a company makes is of lower value to the
economy, presumably because it is wasted. Cashed-in stock options go
directly to job creation. This is not what they taught us in Econ
101.</TE>
<TE>   The honest way to resolve the distortion is to eliminate the
favoritism shown to capital gains and tax all sources of income
equally. Wow! That would be attacked more furiously than honest
reporting of profits.</TE>

<TE>   Petruno touched a nerve of past, present and future corporate
business troubles.</TE>
<TE>   What is the common thread that the leaders of successful companies
share?</TE>
<TE>   They all share and have developed the highest level of both
personal and corporate integrity, values, morals, responsibility,
leadership, trust and vision.</TE>
<TE>   The development and incorporation of strong character traits are
the common thread of respected leaders like Jack Welch, Warren
Buffett, Lee Iacocca and John Bogle. They have the ability and good
sense to surround themselves with people of equal abilities, talent
and good judgment who can serve as examples to be emulated.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders of today's headline corporate failures lack integrity,
moral values and good judgment and deserve to be exposed for their
greed, ineptitude, poor judgment and invisible responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Garbage in, garbage out" appears to reflect the new
accountability mantra.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate executives have a public fiduciary responsibility to do
more than manipulate tax laws and accounting loopholes to provide the
projected quarterly estimates Wall Street wants to hear.</TE>
<TE>   The 21st century boardrooms need to put that same kind of energy
into nurturing their strengths instead of feeding off their
weaknesses. Only then can they replace their shortcomings and
failures with credibility and promise.</TE>

figuring out a stock's true value. Hopefully it won't take another

<HD>Maybe Firms Should Be More Like Nonprofits</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Global Crossing Hurt by Board's Cronyism" [Feb. 24], an unnamed
former director said, "[Directors] are only as good as the
information that is given to them....You don't know if [staff are]
withholding something. You have absolutely no idea."</LD>
<LD>   From the perspective of someone who works extensively with
directors of nonprofit organizations, it is alarming to realize how
often directors of for-profit companies who are paid thousands of
dollars to attend a handful of board meetings a year, often in
luxurious settings like Bermuda, cannot be bothered to take
reasonable steps to assure themselves that they are getting good
information about the companies they oversee. In contrast, consider
the following:</LD>
<LD>   * Directors of nonprofit organizations typically serve as unpaid
volunteers, even when overseeing budgets in the millions and even
billions, such as for hospitals and universities.</LD>
<TE>   * Nonprofit directors are held to strict standards of
accountability. The first, most important lesson nonprofit directors
learn is that the law places ultimate responsibility with them, not
with staff, and that they cannot passively accept the information
staff offers to them.</TE>
<TE>   * Perhaps the most important charge of both a corporate and
nonprofit board is to review and supervise the chief executive.
Nonprofit directors face stiff sanctions under IRS rules and
California corporate law for approving excessive salaries for
executives.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate directors have approved extraordinary pay increases for
CEOs over the last decade, with precious little correlation between
corporate results and increased pay. One can only wonder how well
informed these decisions are too.</TE>
<TE>   "Nonprofits should operate more like businesses," we often hear,
but in the area of governance, at least, perhaps it should be the
other way around.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Loews Hotel in Santa Monica should be thanked, not fined, for
doing the job the government has charged employers with: verifying
that their employees are legally able to work in this country ["Loews
Hotels to Pay $12,000 Fine to Settle Union Complaint," March 4].</LD>
<LD>   The complainant's assertion that the expiration of a U.S.
citizen's passport would not have triggered any kind of a check on
their employment eligibility is absolutely right. A U.S. citizen is
eligible to work here by virtue of their citizenship, whether it be
by birth or naturalization. Passports permit international travel.
They have nothing to do with employment.</LD>
<LD>   A noncitizen legal resident, however, is living and working here
by permission of our government, and when that permission expires, so
do those rights. The expiration of a driver's license doesn't mean
one has lost their ability to drive, but they have lost the legal
right to do so. It's the same with a green card.</LD>
<TE>   Businesses seem now to have two choices: comply with the law by
verifying the legality of their employees and possibly be fined for
it, or don't verify and risk being caught and cited for hiring those
who shouldn't be working here.</TE>

<HD>For Most Couples, Marriage Is a Tax Bonus, Not a Penalty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My fiancee and I will be married in June. Neither
of us have been married, and we are curious whether we should file
our taxes jointly or separately. My salary is $120,000 and hers is
$50,000. We both contribute the maximum amounts to our company
retirement plans. I own a home valued at $355,000 with equity of more
than $210,000, and we have no credit card debt. With the exception of
four cars, two of which we are selling, I believe we're in pretty
good shape. Once married, we'll be changing beneficiary information
where required. Any advice?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Congratulations on your pending nuptials. It sounds like
your finances are in great shape, and they probably will get better.</LD>
<LD>   Although there's been a lot of talk about the marriage
penalty, the truth is that more couples benefit from a marriage
bonus--in other words, they pay less in taxes when they file as a
married couple than they would if they were single. Because there's
a big disparity in your incomes, you and your fiancee probably will
find that your combined tax bill will be lower after you tie the knot,
especially if you choose "married filing jointly" rather than
"married filing separately." Although filing separately can have
advantages in a few situations, more often you'll lose tax breaks
that would be available if you filed jointly.</LD>
<TE>   If you want a better idea of how marriage will affect your taxes,
you can talk to a tax pro or crunch the numbers yourself using a tax
preparation program such as TurboTax or TaxCut. These programs will
figure your taxes both ways so you can choose the better way to file.</TE>

<TE>   Family Matters Rarely Just About Money</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your response headed "Parents Aren't an Investment to Protect"
[Feb. 3] was the perfect example of why I read your column no matter
what the topic. The reader was helping to support his parents and
wanted to ensure his "investment" in them was repaid when his parents
died. You said he could consult a lawyer, but suggested that he
rethink his motives and perhaps abandon the idea of trying to get
more than his siblings. Your reply was not just about money; it was
about life and as generous and wise a perspective as I think I've
ever seen, not to mention simply accurate and practical.</TE>
<TE>   A: Thanks for the kind words. When it comes to family, the issues
are rarely just about money. Powerful emotions often come into play
that cloud people's judgment.</TE>
<TE>   That's why siblings often squabble bitterly about money and
property after--or even before--their parents die. They're often
using money to redress perceived wrongs, salve past hurts or make
things "fair," as if that's really possible. The truly wise let go of
the idea that money can make things right, and concentrate instead on
preserving relationships with their families--particularly the
siblings who will be around long after the parents are gone.</TE>
<TE>   But not everybody views it that way:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: I just read your column about "Parents Aren't an Investment to
Protect" and was so angry that I had to write. How dare you! That man
is helping his parents, the only sibling who is, and you treat him
like a mercenary. He was not trying to get more than his share, just
recoup a part of what he had given, which apparently was agreeable to
his parents. And just because he's single, he has nothing else to
spend his money on? Please!</TE>
<TE>   A: Perhaps parents should keep accounts, too, so they can "recoup"
their "investments" in their children. Everyone could draft long
legal documents that could be fought over in court when Junior,
instead of becoming a baseball star as his parents had planned,
chooses to become a low-paying teacher with not enough extra income
to feather his elders' golden years.</TE>
<TE>   Please.</TE>
<TE>   This man is doing the right thing by helping to support his
parents. It would be nice if the other siblings would contribute, but
they're not--and perhaps they can't.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of viewing his support payments as an investment</TE>
<TE>that needs to be repaid, he might consider the money a small token
of thanks for the sacrifices his parents made to raise him.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the man's father already has drafted a will
that gives the son the lion's share of the estate. The son was
worried that wouldn't be sufficient, but given the small amount
involved--about $60,000--it really doesn't make much sense for him to
battle with his siblings over what's left.</TE>

<HD>High-Cost Loans Often Disguised as Rapid Refunds</HD>
<DH>Taxes: Cash-strapped filers may discover that convenience
comes at a high-interest price.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Low-income taxpayers, attracted by the promise of fast cash, are
being lured into transactions that could drastically cut into their
tax-refund checks, consumer advocates say.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is the practice of coupling refund anticipation
loans--high-interest, short-term loans secured by income tax
refunds--with high-cost, check-cashing services. The
combination--available at many locations of tax preparer H&amp;R Block
Inc.--is popular with taxpayers who want to get their tax refund
quickly. But consumer advocates say that convenience comes at a high
price.</LD>
<LD>   "H&amp;R Block markets itself as 'America's most trusted tax partner,'
but it is encouraging its customers to use high-cost services," said
Shelly Curran, a policy analyst with Consumers Union in San
Francisco. "As a national leader in the tax preparation business, H&amp;R
Block has a responsibility to set a higher standard for the
industry."</LD>
<TE>   The annual percentage rate on refund loans is 67% to 774%,
depending on the size of the refund--much more costly than even the
highest-rate credit card loan, said Chi Chi Wu, staff attorney with
the National Consumer Law Center in Boston. Yet the loan is secured
by a tax refund from the U.S. Treasury, so the lender's risk is
virtually nil.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the purpose of the loans is to get refunds into
taxpayers' hands within two days if the return is filed
electronically. That saves time, but not much. The IRS promises to
mail refund checks--or directly deposit them to taxpayer
accounts--within two weeks of receiving an e-filed return. (Almost
all refund loans are made to taxpayers who file electronically,
mainly because most tax preparation firms won't make refund loans on
paper returns, which take longer to process and are far more likely
to contain errors.)</TE>
<TE>   H&amp;R Block's deal with Ace Cash Express Inc. to place check-cashing
machines in 9,000 H&amp;R Block tax preparation offices nationwide is
drawing fire from consumer advocates. The machines allow taxpayers
who may not have access to a checking account to immediately cash
their refund-loan checks--for a 3% fee.</TE>
<TE>   Between tax preparation fees, electronic-filing fees, refund-loan
fees and check-cashing fees, a consumer who expected a $1,600 tax
refund could see almost 17% of that amount--$267--wiped away, Wu
said.</TE>
<TE>   H&amp;R Block said that although consumer groups are critical of the
costs, consumers continue to clamor for the loans.</TE>
<TE>   "We offer them because some of our clients have demanded them,"
said Denise Sposato, spokeswoman for H&amp;R Block. "Until the IRS can
get refunds delivered in two or three days, some of our clients will
want to get their money faster."</TE>
<TE>   H&amp;R Block isn't alone in offering refund loans. Intuit Inc. offers
the loans, as do other tax preparers, which generally make the loans
in partnership with banks such as Household Bank and Bank One Corp.,
according to Bloomberg News. A January report by the National
Consumer Law Center showed that about 10.8 million of the
approximately 92million individual refund recipients take out refund
loans each year.</TE>
<TE>   Nor are the fees charged by the Kansas City, Mo.-based H&amp;R Block
particularly unusual. The Consumer Law Center estimated Americans
spend more than $800 million a year on refund loans.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates say tax refund loans are disproportionately
popular among low-income consumers. About 4.3 million of the loans
are obtained by people who also claim the earned income tax credit, a
tax break for the working poor. These individuals are arguably the
least able to afford high-cost tax services.</TE>
<TE>   Why do they do it? The National Consumer Law Center found that a
significant portion of low-income filers needed the refund loan to
pay tax preparation fees, Wu said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these fees are easily avoided. Low-income taxpayers can
visit Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Centers to have their returns
prepared for free. The IRS provides lists of these centers, which set
up on college campuses, senior centers and nonprofit groups during
tax season, on its Web site at www.irs.gov. Or they can call the IRS
help line at (800) 829-1040.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of the loans may diminish as the IRS improves its
computer systems. When the new system goes on line, taxpayers who
e-file will be able to get refunds in two or three days.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, consumer advocates urge taxpayers to consider all
their options before agreeing to a high-cost, short-term loan.</TE>

<HD>For Nasdaq, a Bittersweet Anniversary</HD>
<DH>Two years after reaching its peak, the market index is
rallying, but will investors ever see 5,000 again?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last week declared the
recession over and a recovery "well underway."</LD>
<LD>   It's purely coincidence that Greenspan's declaration arrived two
years to the week the Nasdaq composite stock index reached its
all-time high of 5,048.62. That turned out to be the exclamation
point on the technology stock mania that defined the late 1990s, and
the beginning of the "new economy's" painful comeuppance.</LD>
<LD>   If recovery is here for the broad economy, what about recovery for
the Nasdaq index, which at 1,929.67 on Friday still is down 62% from
its peak? Will most investors see 5,000 again in their lifetimes?</LD>
<TE>   Those questions have mere curiosity value for many people, but for
others--those who bought technology stocks in 1999 or early 2000 and
have held on--this is about serious money.</TE>
<TE>   Tech investors have to feel better after last week, which saw the
Nasdaq index surge 7% as Wall Street took Greenspan's upbeat views on
the economy to heart. The broad market also advanced, with the Dow
Jones industrials adding 2% for the week, to 10,572.49 by Friday, and
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rising 2.9%.</TE>
<TE>   If the Dow gains 11% from here, it will surpass its record high of
11,722 set in January 2000. The S&amp;P 500, by contrast, needs a 31%
advance to retake its all-time high, which like Nasdaq's was reached
in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   For Nasdaq, the challenge of getting back to 5,000 is truly
monumental, mathematically speaking: The index would have to soar
162% from Friday's close to eclipse the old bull-market peak.</TE>
<TE>   The temptation is to instantly dismiss the idea of a return to the
vicinity of 5,000 any time soon as wishful thinking or worse; given
the excesses that the Nasdaq peak represented in terms of rank
speculation and ignorance of basic investing tenets, asking for 5,000
would seem to be begging for another disaster.</TE>
<TE>   But as stocks and stock indexes go, it isn't the nominal price
level that's important, of course. What matters is that price level
relative to what's behind it in terms of corporate asset values and
earnings, and relative to what's happening in the economy as a whole,
especially with interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Recent history includes two drastic market declines that were
substantially recouped much faster than many investors imagined when
they were looking up from the bear-market bottoms:</TE>
<TE>   * In 1973-74, the S&amp;P 500 plunged nearly 50%, the worst decline
since the 1929-32 bear market, amid soaring oil prices and inflation,
President Nixon's resignation and a host of other troubles.</TE>
<TE>   But within two years of the S&amp;P's bottom (reached in December
1974), the index had gained back 80% of what it lost.</TE>
<TE>   * In 1987, the Dow index plummeted from a high of 2,722 to a low
of 1,738 in the course of two months, including the 508-point, 22.6%
decline of Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors at the time wondered whether they'd ever see a Dow
of 2,700 again. Yet by late 1989, the index was at a new high.</TE>
<TE>   For a number of reasons, however, many Wall Street pros say
Nasdaq's rise and fall probably are better compared with what
happened to blue-chip shares in the late 1920s and early 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   From its peak in the speculative frenzy of 1929, the Dow index
lost 90% by the time in bottomed in July 1932. In Nasdaq's case, the
decline from the March 2000 peak to Sept. 21, the low of the last
year, was 72%.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone hoping for a 5,000 Nasdaq in the next few years won't be
encouraged by the Dow's track record after the 1932 market bottom: It
wasn't until 1954 that the Dow returned to its 1929 level.</TE>
<TE>   Could a return to Nasdaq 5,000 likewise take 25 years? That may
seem to be an absurd proposition in the absence of the devastating
events what weighed on the market in the 1930s and `40s (the
Depression and World War II).</TE>
<TE>   But even if investors knew they had to wait 10 years for Nasdaq
and its major tech stocks just to get near their old peaks, many
might find that to be interminable.</TE>
<TE>   Louise Yamada, a market chart-watcher at brokerage Salomon Smith
Barney in New York, said she wouldn't hazard a guess about the time
required to retake the old Nasdaq peak. But the case against getting
there any time soon, she said, is that "it's unlikely that a bubble
is going to be followed [quickly] by another bubble," at least in the
same market sector.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say the best argument against a huge new rally in
most technology stocks is that the late-1990s bubble only deflated
somewhat, but didn't burst.</TE>
<TE>   How so? Because the bubble wasn't 5,000 itself, but tech shares'
price-to-earnings ratios at 5,000. Now, though tech stock prices have
collapsed since March 2000, so have the companies' earnings. As many
frustrated bargain hunters know all too well, tech price-to-earnings
ratios remain in the stratosphere when comparing current share prices
with estimated 2002 earnings and in some cases when comparing with
results expected in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Consider networking giant Cisco Systems. Friday's closing stock
price was $17.80, down 78% from the March 2000 peak of $79.38. But
Cisco is expected to earn 32 cents a share in the fiscal year ending
in July and 47 cents next year, according to the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/IBES.</TE>
<TE>   That means the stock is priced at 56 times this year's earnings
estimate and 38 times next year's estimate. The average blue-chip
stock, by contrast, is priced between 20 and 25 times this year's
estimated earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Another example: Shares of KLA Tencor, a maker of semiconductor
manufacturing equipment, helped stoke the Nasdaq rally last week,
reaching a 52-week high of $69.47 by Friday. At that price, investors
are paying 69 times the average analyst earnings estimate for this
fiscal year and 53 times the following year's estimated results.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible that analysts are severely underestimating the
potential earnings recoveries of tech firms such as Cisco and KLA
Tencor. But it's also possible that analysts are overestimating
earnings, if the economic recovery turns out to be a dud.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, there are few analysts on Wall Street who are arguing
that tech stocks in general are cheap today.</TE>
<TE>   If valuation concerns keep the stocks of Nasdaq's technology
titans, including Cisco, Dell Computer, Oracle and Intel, from
heading to the moon again, then the 5,000 level on the Nasdaq
composite index may be very difficult to get near. The simple reason:
The index is market-capitalization-weighted. That means the largest
stocks by market capitalization (stock prices multiplied by the
number of shares outstanding) matter most in determining the index's
price changes.</TE>
<TE>   Though Cisco, Dell and Intel shares are shadows of their former
selves, they still are the dominant stocks by market cap in the
Nasdaq market. Thus, as they go, so the Nasdaq index is likely to go.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the dominance of those tech giants has been abetted
by the loss of hundreds of other stocks from Nasdaq's ranks over the
last few years because of failures, mergers or delistings. Nasdaq now
lists shares of 4,072 companies, down from more than 5,500 at the
peak in the late `90s.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the small and mid-size stocks that are left on Nasdaq
continue to perform well. That's evident in the year-to-date gains of
indexes such as the S&amp;P small-cap 600, which is up 5%.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, in some non-tech Nasdaq sectors, stocks have been
reaching new highs lately. Financial stocks, in particular, have been
hot. The Nasdaq financial-100 index, packed with regional banks,
smaller brokerages and insurance firms, hit a record Wednesday and is
up 7.3% this year.</TE>
<TE>   But the weight of the tech giants is such that the Nasdaq
composite remains in the red this year, even after last week's rally.
The index is down 1.1% since Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Who cares if Nasdaq never approaches 5,000 again? some investors
rightly note: There still will be plenty of opportunities to make
money in Nasdaq stocks, as the financial sector is demonstrating.
(Don't drive the car while looking only in the rearview mirror, as
the old investing line goes.)</TE>
<TE>   There also are some analysts who warn that it would be a big
mistake to underestimate the potential for the technology sector to
spawn tremendous new products in this decade. When that happens,
companies that may be afterthoughts on Nasdaq today, or that aren't
yet even public, could become exciting new leaders, with market caps
to match.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a [tech] event out there that's going to capture
everyone's imagination, and there we will go again," said Jim
Glassman, economist at J.P. Morgan Chase in New York.</TE>

<HD>Pitt's Revised Agenda</HD>
<DH>Securities and Exchange Commission chairman concedes
missteps in pursuit of market reforms but presses ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In October, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L.
Pitt uttered three words that he's been trying to live down ever
since.</LD>
<LD>   In his first official speech since taking office two months
earlier, Pitt indicated to a gathering of accountants that he wanted
a "kinder and gentler" SEC that would be less combative with the
firms it regulates.</LD>
<LD>   Barely a month later, Enron Corp. disintegrated in a heap of
financial misdeeds, and Pitt was mobbed by criticism that he was too
cozy with the accounting industry and was failing to put investors'
interests first.</LD>
<TE>   Few SEC chairmen have become embroiled in controversy as early in
their terms as the 57-year-old Pitt, whose appointment as head of the
nation's market regulatory agency fulfilled his long-held dream.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the question is how Pitt's trial by fire will affect his
ability to shape the agency, and securities regulation, at what is a
watershed moment for both.</TE>
<TE>   The calls for change that have rung out in the wake of the
scandal-ridden failures of Enron and Global Crossing Ltd. offer a
chance to etch the most substantive market reforms since those that
followed the Great Depression, some say.</TE>
<TE>   But Pitt's early image problems complicate his task of navigating
between a skeptical public and a Congress agitating for action, while
staying true to his own beliefs and those of the conservative
president who appointed him.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Pitt's SEC staff of 3,000 is suffering heavy turnover
and sagging morale and is, by his own estimation, underpaid and
lacking critical resources.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Pitt implored Congress to free up $76 million to
boost SEC salaries, and an additional $15 million to hire 100 more
lawyers and accountants to handle the more aggressive market
oversight that lawmakers and the public now demand.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, this is a historic opportunity to do a lot," said
Patrick McGurn, vice president at Institutional Shareholder Services,
an investment-consulting firm in Rockville, Md. "Historic
opportunities don't come around too often. The question is whether
Pitt's commission has been so wounded that it has to spend all its
time nursing itself back to health."</TE>
<TE>   From the moment he was tapped by President Bush in July to be the
26th SEC chairman since the agency's founding in 1934, Pitt made
clear that he would differ in philosophy, and style, from the man he
succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   Former Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr.'s heated clashes with the
accounting and securities industries carved his reputation as a
fierce advocate for small investors.</TE>
<TE>   The Brooklyn-born Pitt, a renowned securities lawyer whose career
began in 1968 with a decade-long stint at the SEC, sought more of a
middle ground: He said he wanted to improve corporate financial
disclosure while also easing regulation on some fronts--for example,
by streamlining the process by which big companies sell securities in
capital markets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Greater Urgency for Reform Agenda</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview with The Times, Pitt said the Enron debacle
had not changed his mind about the agenda he originally wanted to
push at the SEC. Rather, he said he saw a greater urgency to speed
its implementation.</TE>
<TE>   At the top of his list, he said, were raising SEC staff pay and
gaining the legal authority to prevent executives or directors who
engage in wrongdoing from working at other companies.</TE>
<TE>   However, Pitt also said any and all reform ideas were now on the
table--a concession that would have seemed unlikely pre-Enron.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Bush gave Pitt's program a strong endorsement when
the president unveiled a financial-reform package that closely tracks
many recent Pitt initiatives. For example, Bush wants to expand the
list of significant events that companies must disclose immediately
to the SEC and investors. He also proposes speeding up insiders'
reporting of personal stock transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Almost "every one of these is something that emanates from recent
SEC proposals under Harvey Pitt," said John Coffee, a Columbia
University law professor. "The president has turned to him and said,
'What are the [policies] we can endorse without undercutting our own
constituency?' "</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said it was notable that Bush's plan excluded a
suggestion from Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill that Pitt was
known to oppose: O'Neill wanted to make it easier to punish
executives by lowering the legal standard for wrongdoing from
intentional "recklessness" to simple "negligence." Pitt and some
others feared that would spur additional litigation against
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics continue to deride Pitt as kowtowing to the big
accounting firms that he once represented as a private lawyer, and
say his reform proposals are too modest to prevent more Enrons in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt jabs back at his critics, saying people have twisted his
words.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people who are afraid that they will be
saddled with the blame for [Enron], so the best defense is a good
offense," Pitt said. "The notion is to go on the attack and question
the integrity of people who are actually serious about solving the
problem."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt said he still was seeking to establish a tone of respect and
cooperation with those the SEC regulates. That doesn't mean the
agency would go lightly on wrongdoers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Working with industry "does not mean that we have gone, or will
go, 'soft' on securities violations or financial fraud," he told a
lawyers group in early November, before Enron exploded.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that I was willing to listen to people and hear their
ideas and try to respond to them didn't mean that anybody could get
away with anything," Pitt told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitt Concedes He Made Some Gaffes</TE>
<TE>   Some say they are surprised that Pitt, a Washington insider,
seemed initially to not notice the furor that his words and actions
were stirring.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a guy who everybody called one of the power brokers in
Washington, and he showed himself to have a rough touch," McGurn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, well-respected for his sharp intellect and for his work
ethic, concedes that he has stumbled in trying to get his message
across.</TE>
<TE>   "I fault myself for not having communicated the way people are
required to communicate in significant public office and in
Washington. I've lived in Washington 33 years, and my approach to
life was somewhat a throwback to being a lawyer. Of course, now I
understand quite well that not only am I a lawyer ... but I'm a
policymaker and I have to communicate as a policymaker. That is an
area where I could have done a lot better."</TE>
<TE>   Post-Enron, he has displayed a notably toughened tone about the
SEC's mission--in part, experts say, to head off Congress from
usurping his agenda with legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been working hard to reposition himself," Coffee said.
"He's tried to find some new issues to get out in front of."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt has, for example, said disgraced executives and directors
should be made to give up any ill-gotten stock gains. And he has
admonished accountants and lawyers to follow the spirit, not simply
the letter, of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, whose father worked at a supermarket delicatessen, wasn't
born into Wall Street's culture. His image as someone closely tied to
the securities industry stems from the roster of clients he defended
in 23 years in private practice at New York law firm Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Critics Point to Private-Sector Ties</TE>
<TE>   His clients included the infamous insider trader Ivan Boesky, each
of the Big Five accounting firms and the accounting industry's chief
trade group, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.</TE>
<TE>   As an attorney for the trade group in the 1990s, Pitt successfully
beat back a plan by Levitt to bar accountants from consulting work
that could conflict with their audits.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the broad support that idea has generated in the aftermath
of devastating revelations about Enron's auditor, Andersen, Pitt says
he still doesn't favor it, labeling it a "simplistic solution to a
complicated problem."</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that people are missing in all of this is that
a firm that only does audit work becomes more dependent on its audit
clients, not less dependent on its audit clients," he said. "Firms
that have multiple sources of income can afford to be more
independent. It just means you have to make sure that they don't have
any ambiguity in where their loyalties lie."</TE>
<TE>   That stance hardens the view of critics who say he puts his
private-sector clients first. Pitt, in turn, has become visibly angry
when responding to that allegation.</TE>
<TE>   "Lawyers represent clients, but they [lawyers] aren't the
clients," he said. "The notion that people wanted to attribute the
views of my clients to me disserves everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Before Enron collapsed, Pitt won high marks for his first
challenge as SEC chairman: soothing markets and helping quickly
relaunch stock trading after Sept. 11. He coaxed rival brokerages to
share office space to get Wall Street functioning again and displayed
a cool behind-the-scenes demeanor.</TE>
<TE>   But by October and November, Pitt was out front with proposals
that instantly raised the hackles of Washington insiders and others
who feared the SEC's watchdog function would be weakened.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the SEC introduced a policy in October under which it
promised to consider lighter penalties--and in some cases no
penalties at all--for companies that voluntarily disclosed financial
wrongdoing and took steps to make amends.</TE>
<TE>   After Enron crumbled and attacks on the accounting industry
mushroomed, Pitt in January unveiled what would be his most
controversial plan so far: the formation of a new oversight
organization to monitor accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   Detractors, including some Republicans in Congress, say Pitt's
idea for a new oversight board is woefully inadequate. Pitt said this
new board would have strong disciplinary power, but opponents say it
would be controlled by the accounting industry. Even archconservative
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) took aim at Pitt's idea.</TE>
<TE>   The uproar increased when it was revealed that Pitt drew up his
proposal after a series of private meetings with the accounting firms
he once represented.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's supporters say his intentions and methods have been
portrayed unfairly. Whereas Levitt scrapped with the accounting
industry, Pitt is seeking reform through a cooperative approach, his
backers say.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a guy of tremendous integrity," said Stanley Sporkin, a
former federal judge who worked with Pitt at the SEC in the 1970s. As
for Pitt's overtures to accountants, "it wasn't in any way an attempt
to curry favor with those folks. That's not how he works," Sporkin
said.</TE>
<TE>   As a private attorney, Pitt routinely pressed clients to do what
was ethically proper, not just what was legally allowable, said Dixie
Johnson, a partner at Fried Frank.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen him inspire clients to do the right things many times,"
Johnson said. Pitt also dumped at least five or six clients in the
last decade over ethical clashes, she said.</TE>

<TE>   'It Is a Moment to Be Seized'</TE>
<TE>   On a personal level, Pitt was a demanding but sympathetic boss,
Johnson said. With Pitt's support, Johnson took three months off in
1988 to care for her dying mother, she said. When she stayed away
longer than expected, Johnson offered to have the firm discontinue
her salary during her absence. Pitt rejected the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the turmoil that has marked his seven months in office,
Pitt, a movie buff, said he remained thrilled with his job, even if
others say he has been forced to partly rewrite his script.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt is aware that his legacy may depend in large part on his
response to Enron and its aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   "As terrible as Enron is, it is a moment to be seized," he said.
"We have to move and move quickly to protect public investors. Enron
gives us the impetus to make sure we do that and we do that quickly."</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't anything that I have ever done that I don't think I
can do better. No matter what anyone else says, I always believe that
I can learn and improve. In that sense, I'm my own worst critic."</TE>

<LD>Improving Job Market Underscores Recovery</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. economy added jobs in February for the first time in
seven months, pushing the unemployment rate down to 5.5% and capping
a week of signs the economy is snapping back from recession faster
than anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   The new hiring knocked a tenth of a point off the January jobless
rate and pushed unemployment to its lowest level since October.</LD>
<TE>   For those employed in California, personal income in the state
shrunk 0.7% in the third quarter of 2001, the first quarterly decline
since at least 1970.</TE>
<TE>   The major culprit, analysts said, was a precipitous drop in income
derived from employee stock options, which had fueled spectacular
wealth creation in California in recent years.</TE>

<TE>   L.A. Firms May Bid for Global Crossing</TE>
<TE>   Two Los Angeles-based turnaround companies took an interest in
ailing Global Crossing Ltd., with sources saying formal bids for the
telecommunications company could come this week.</TE>
<TE>   Gores Technology Group, run by Alec Gores, and Platinum Equity,
run by Alec's brother Tom, are reviewing the books of Global
Crossing, which filed for Bankruptcy Court protection Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   The company's creditors remain unimpressed by an offer from two
Singapore firms to invest $750 million in Global Crossing for a 79%
stake in a reorganized version of the company. Responding to pressure
from creditors and bondholders, company officials announced further
cost-cutting measures. It will lay off 1,600 employees and consider
selling its European network and telecommunications conferencing
business.</TE>
<TE>   A Bankruptcy Court hearing this week will decide the fate of the
Singapore firms' offer and set up procedures for weighing other bids.</TE>

<TE>   Justice Department Steps Up Andersen Probe</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department sources said they were focusing increased
attention on Enron Corp.'s former accounting firm, Andersen, and its
admitted practice of shredding documents in connection with its audit
of the energy company.</TE>
<TE>   Justice officials would not confirm, however, whether they have
presented a grand jury in Houston with a request for an indictment,
but current and former officials said such action had been
contemplated for at least six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen officials have discussed the company's internal findings
of document shredding at its Houston office with the Justice
Department, other sources familiar with the investigation said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen fired the executive in charge of auditing Enron in
January, saying partner David B. Duncan organized an effort at the
firm's Houston office to destroy thousands of documents after
learning of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra said he could not
discuss anything related to the Enron-Andersen case, including
whether any enforcement actions were pending. Andersen also refused
to comment.</TE>

<TE>   HP Wins Key Support in Compaq Merger Fight</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett-Packard Co. scored a major victory in its hard-fought
campaign to take over Compaq Computer Corp., winning the endorsement
of an influential advisor to big investors.</TE>
<TE>   Institutional Shareholder Services said the $22-billion merger was
a better bet than a plan by dissident HP director Walter Hewlett for
the company to go it alone and reinvest in its profitable printing
business.</TE>
<TE>   With about 20% of HP shares committed to opposing the deal and a
much smaller number publicly in favor, opposition by ISS could have
left the merger's prospects all but dead. Now, HP's management may
have a slight edge ahead of a March 19 vote.</TE>
<TE>   About 23% of HP shares are held by ISS clients, some of whom
automatically follow the firm's recommendations.</TE>

<TE>   Boeing Wins Military Contract Worth Billions</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Co. won a highly coveted contract to develop a network of
new weapons, communication systems and intelligence-gathering sensors
that the Pentagon hopes one day will revolutionize the way the Army
fights wars.</TE>
<TE>   In a major boost to Southern California's defense industry,
Boeing's space and communications unit, headquartered in Seal Beach,
upset two other top defense firms to win the contract, which has a
potential value of at least $4 billion over the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   Defense analysts said the overall value could top $10 billion as
elements of Future Combat Systems are deployed over the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   The Army for the first time is asking a single defense contractor
to oversee development of new technologies that would bring the
service into the digital age.</TE>

<TE>   Northrop Launches Hostile Bid for TRW</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman Corp. launched a hostile bid for TRW Inc. after
TRW directors rejected as financially inadequate an initial proposal
to purchase the automotive parts and aerospace company for $5.9
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Escalating tensions, Northrop also filed lawsuits in Ohio
challenging that state's anti-takeover statutes as directors of
Cleveland-based TRW asked shareholders to delay responding to
Northrop's proxy solicitation to purchase the company's stock.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based Northrop, which recently completed the
acquisition of Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. to become the world's
largest military shipbuilder, wants TRW's defense and aerospace
business, and said it would sell the automotive unit if it was
successful.</TE>

<TE>   President Calls for Investor Safeguards</TE>
<TE>   In formally announcing a set of reforms designed to protect
investors from the kinds of abuses seen in the Enron Corp. collapse,
President Bush said corporate officers must be held to a higher
standard.</TE>
<TE>   He proposed that executives who mislead investors or sign off on
inaccurate financial statements be required to return bonuses or be
barred from serving at public companies.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush declined to endorse a proposal advocated by Treasury
Secretary Paul H. O'Neill that would have made it harder for
executives to rely on company-paid insurance policies to pay the
legal costs of defending them in shareholder lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The president feared such a requirement might encourage investors
to sue corporate officers.</TE>

<TE>   California Drivers to See Jump in Gas Prices</TE>
<TE>   California drivers are bracing for a new surge in gasoline prices
brought about by refinery problems, higher oil prices and increased
demand.</TE>
<TE>   Wholesale gasoline prices in Los Angeles and San Francisco have
jumped about 25 cents in the last week, and that increase is expected
to appear soon at the pump.</TE>
<TE>   California gasoline prices have been rising steadily for weeks
because of annual refinery maintenance, the yearly switch to
summer-grade gasoline and a boomlet in gasoline demand sparked by the
improving economy.</TE>
<TE>   The state's wholesale market is being roiled by outages at the
Valero Energy Corp. refinery in Wilmington and the ChevronTexaco
Corp. refinery in Richmond. And higher crude prices are contributing
to the gas price increase.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Justices to Decide on NextWave Licenses</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the government must pay
billions of dollars to reclaim unused wireless spectrum space from
NextWave Telecom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The high court's action will further delay resolution of the
long-running dispute over valuable spectrum that could provide better
mobile phone service in several cities, but some analysts think it
will prompt a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   At stake is extra spectrum space for wireless transmissions in
overcrowded markets such as Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San
Francisco, Seattle and Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The stake for the federal government is huge too. The Federal
Communications Commission is on the hook for $16 billion after
reclaiming the spectrum from NextWave when it filed for bankruptcy
and holding a second auction. The appellate court ruled the new
auction violated bankruptcy laws.</TE>

<TE>   Buying Spree Leads to Big Loss for Vivendi</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal reported an $11.8-billion loss for 2001, as it
wrote down the costs of a string of acquisitions that built it into
the world's second-largest media company. The loss, contrasted with a
profit of $2 billion in 2000, was the largest in French corporate
history.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 18 months, Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier
has turned a sewage disposal and water company into a rival of AOL
Time Warner Inc. by acquiring Universal and European cable TV giant
Canal Plus. Vivendi is close to buying the TV and film assets of USA
Networks Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But as the 149-year-old Vivendi shifts to U.S. accounting rules
this quarter to build its profile here, the company has faced growing
scrutiny by analysts and investors who have grown impatient with its
complex balance sheet and the French accounting methods it uses.</TE>
<TE>   Messier downplayed the significance of the write-down, calling it
a "bookkeeping concept." The company's books are "totally
transparent," he said.</TE>

<HD>UPS Talks to Present Hoffa With Key Test</HD>
<DH>Labor: Teamsters chief must win over skeptical members as
firm tries to avoid repeat of '97 strike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Teamsters union and United Parcel Service Inc. are back at the
bargaining table in their first major matchup since 1997, when a
15-day strike disrupted U.S. commerce and raised hopes for the
renaissance of organized labor.</LD>
<LD>   The negotiations pit a storied union against one of the nation's
largest employers, raising issues familiar to many American workers:
rising health-care costs, part-time work and the recessionary drag on
wages.</LD>
<LD>   They also will be a key test of the leadership of International
Brotherhood of Teamsters President James P. Hoffa, who must prove to
skeptical UPS employees that he can be as aggressive as his
predecessor and former rival, Ron Carey.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the first big Hoffa battle," said Tom Juravich, director
of the Labor Center at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
"He's got to deliver enough so he can legitimately claim victory. If
he doesn't, I think the dissent in his union will grow."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Hoffa's personality is far less combative than
Carey's was, and he has shown himself ready and willing to work with
employers, as evidenced by the Teamsters' successful lobbying to help
open China to UPS.</TE>
<TE>   UPS increasingly is important to the Teamsters, which has shrunk
in size over the last two decades as the package delivery company
grew. Company spokesman Norman Black said UPS has been the union's
sole growth engine in recent years. Now, with 230,000 represented
employees, the company has the largest single group in the
1.4-million-member union.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides have a new appreciation for how our futures are
inextricably linked," Black said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hoffa, who sat down to his first bargaining session last
month with 60 union subordinates at his side, already has come out
swinging. "We're going to be asking for a lot of money," he said in a
telephone interview. "We think our people are behind for the kind of
work they do. Look at the profits this company is making. The workers
should share in that too."</TE>
<TE>   Although Hoffa talks tough, Atlanta-based UPS is portraying the
negotiations as amicable and destined for early resolution. The
company, which ships 13.6 million packages a day, lost an estimated
$750 million in revenue during the strike and spent months afterward
rebuilding customer trust.</TE>
<TE>   Black said thousands of customers who were stranded in 1997 still
hedge by sending a portion of their business to other carriers. The
last thing the company wants is to give them a reason to divert more
of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Our employees are the best, and they will be rewarded for being
the best," Black said. Still, he noted that the economy is in
recession and rivals such as FedEx Corp. are nipping at UPS' heels.
"We are not asking for rollbacks even though we are in a recession.
We are not going to call for any reductions in benefits. We will
reward our employees while still maintaining our ability to compete."</TE>
<TE>   The current contract expires at midnight July 31. Business
analysts and labor experts said they expect negotiations to continue
at least until midsummer, despite UPS' pledge to wrap up early.</TE>
<TE>   Already, dissidents within the Teamsters are pressuring Hoffa to
go slow, arguing that the union's clout grows as the threat of a
strike increases. In a recent newsletter to UPS employees, the
Teamsters for a Democratic Union, which opposed Hoffa in the last two
union elections, wrote, "We need to organize to show UPS that we
won't settle for anything less than what we deserve. And we need to
tell top union officials that we will vote down any contract that
doesn't meet our needs."</TE>
<TE>   So far, only noneconomic proposals have been exchanged. The thorny
issues of wages, benefits and pension contributions will be among the
last to be addressed.</TE>
<TE>   Black said UPS wages are the highest in the business. Full-time
drivers earn on average $23.11 an hour, compared with $15.72 an hour
at FedEx and $19 at the U.S. Postal Service. Benefits also are
"dramatically better" than those offered by competitors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But part-time drivers, who represent 58% of the 230,000
Teamsters-covered workers at UPS, earn substantially less, starting
at $8.50 an hour, which Hoffa claims is an industry low. Part-time
wages average $10.72 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Part-time work was a leading issue in the 1997 strike and one that
resonated strongly with an American public that had watched jobs
throughout the economy shift toward part-time, temporary and other
contingent arrangements. To end the strike, UPS pledged to convert
2,000 part-time jobs to full-time jobs each year of the five-year
contract. UPS later resisted the shift, saying business volume did
not warrant the increase, but an arbiter eventually forced the
company to comply.</TE>
<TE>   The Teamsters head into this contract demanding the company move
3,000 more jobs to full time each year. Black would not address
specifics, but said, "That depends solely on whether or not we have a
growing business. You can't create jobs when you're shrinking."</TE>
<TE>   Another sticking point may be the Teamsters' demand that UPS allow
the union to easily organize the company's fast-expanding side
business of providing logistics planning for other firms. The union
also is asking UPS to absorb any increases in health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   Although the number of workers alone warrants attention, these
negotiations will be watched closely because of what happened in
1997. At the time, the strike--which received a surprising amount of
public support--was seen as a watershed for organized labor. "I
remember viewing it as the end of the decline," said Harley Shaiken,
a labor expert in the sociology department at UC Berkeley. "Looking
back, it was a significant moment. It wasn't a turning point. It
stopped the bleeding but didn't signal a turnaround in labor
fortunes."</TE>
<TE>   Months after the strike, Teamsters President Carey, a former UPS
driver, was caught up in a campaign fund-raising scandal that
eventually led to his ouster from the union.</TE>
<TE>   A new election followed, which Hoffa won despite having little
support from UPS employees. Two months ago, he won reelection against
the same rival, Tom Leedham. The vote count was by union local, and
those representing UPS employees were about evenly split on Hoffa,
according to both camps. The Leedham campaign focused strongly on how
well Hoffa would handle these negotiations.</TE>

<HD>Pay It Forward, With Music</HD>
<DH>A high school band director makes good on a debt by
instilling in his students a philosophy of giving back to the
community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUANE NORIYUKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fernando Pullum studies the faces of band students at Washington
Preparatory High School in South-Central Los Angeles. In their eyes,
he sees reflections of himself long ago, before he understood the
hope in music, before he made his promise.</LD>
<LD>   It was a promise that went back decades, linking Pullum to two
other music teachers, one now deceased, one still teaching. From one
to the other, it was handed down like a torch, and as Pullum stands
before his students, he passes the flame to them.</LD>
<LD>   You pay back those who have helped you, the promise goes, by
helping others. Based on that concept, Pullum has built one of the
most successful high school music programs in the city.</LD>
<TE>   Through a program he founded, Kids Helping Kids, Washington Prep
band members spend Saturday mornings giving free lessons to younger
children, the youngest just 4 years old. About 100 children
participate, and they pay back the favor by performing at
convalescent homes around the city.</TE>
<TE>   "If each one of my students helps 10 people, and if they help 10
people, and then they help 10 people, look at the numbers," Pullum
says.</TE>
<TE>   As in the movie, "Pay It Forward," good deeds have grown, touching
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of lives beyond the three men, all
graduates of the University of Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Like his predecessors, Pullum is demanding. If students are late
to class or fail to do homework, he will have them run laps. If they
hit a wrong note, he will have them "celebrate"--drop to the floor
and do push-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Such stringency, he says, does not come naturally. He pushes
because he feels he must, because he teaches at a time and place in
which tragedy seems to lay in wait for the young and because malaise
ignites him. At age 44, he has attended the funerals of too many who
died too young.</TE>
<TE>   His students live complicated lives. About 40% are in foster care
or live with relatives other than their parents. An equal number of
students are from families in which no one has gone to college. So
Pullum gives them music and his home telephone number. He writes it
on the chalkboard next to his name on the first day of class, and it
doesn't take long for the phone to start ringing.</TE>
<TE>   He is, says his wife, Akilah Bakeer Pullum, constantly working to
solve his students' problems, most of them having nothing to do with
music. Two years ago, he drove every morning to Glendale to pick up a
student and drive her to Washington Prep, a magnet school, so that
she could graduate.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want any of them to slip through your fingers," he
says. "So you do whatever you need to do to help them, and when you
do lose one, you cling a little tighter. You try harder."</TE>
<TE>   If there is a bottom line to his work, it might be this: Of 163
band members who have graduated during the past 10 years, 161 have
gone on to four-year schools. One opted for culinary school, and
Pullum is still working on the other student.</TE>
<TE>   For Pullum, music is important only when it enters the soul and
becomes a part of something greater. It is a means of communicating
important ideals, he says, among them hope and love and
determination. It is a way to give, a tool to foster change.</TE>
<TE>   He knows music is powerful because as a young man growing up in
Chicago he held a gun in one hand, a horn in the other and,
ultimately, it was the horn that saved his life.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has played on "The Tonight Show" and "Saturday Night
Live" and with artists including Cab Calloway, Ella Fitzgerald and
the Temptations, his most important gig is here, in a room with tiles
missing from the walls, in front of young musicians.</TE>
<TE>   "Who can explain why we are here?" Pullum asks. "What is it we're
trying to do?"</TE>
<TE>   Students, with instruments in hand, look at him from behind music
stands containing "Allegro Barbaro" by Bartok. Paulette Oubre, a
ninth-grader seated in back, speaks out clearly, softly.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to change the world," she says, "a little bit at a
time."</TE>
<TE>   "Good," says Pullum.</TE>
<TE>   And then the music begins.</TE>
<TE>   It started in the mid-1960s in Detroit, where a teacher named
Anderson White taught band, at various times, in elementary, junior
and senior high schools. White was a big man, 220 or 230 pounds, and
according to one of his students, not opposed, if a student had a
problem with him, to step inside the gym, close the doors and settle
differences.</TE>
<TE>   He also would reach into his own pocket if a child needed clothes
or food, and on weekends he would load students and instruments into
his station wagon and drive them to concerts, workshops and
competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Bonita White, his wife of 14 years, says it was not unusual for
several of his students to be seated with them at the dinner table on
any given night. One of their more frequent guests was a student at
Durfee Junior High, Marcellus Brown.</TE>
<TE>   For Christmas 1965, White gave Brown the sheet music for the Haydn
Trumpet Concerto. "I want you to listen to it," he said. "You should
learn this piece." Brown, now a music professor at Boise State
University in Idaho, is still working on it. He has performed it
throughout his career, most recently with the Boise Summerfest
Orchestra. He teaches it to his students.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy White made me believe I could do whatever it was I wanted to
do in music," says Brown, one of many former students now teaching
music all over the country who mourned White's death a year and a
half ago at age 66.</TE>
<TE>   "If you expose people to great things and help them understand and
see the greatness in it, you help them become successful,'' Brown
says. "That's what Andy White did, that's what I have tried to do,
and that's what Fernando is doing."</TE>
<TE>   Brown was teaching at Chicago State University in the late 1970s,
when he met Fernando Pullum, who was working in a shoe store at the
time. As a child, Pullum lived with his great-grandmother for the
most part, but there were times when he stayed with his mother, and
that is when he would knock on strangers' doors to ask for food.</TE>
<TE>   His early role models were the drug dealers and pimps on Chicago's
Madison Avenue, in their fancy cars and fine clothes. He bought his
first gun in seventh grade for $5. People told Pullum he was destined
for prison or early death. Only one, a neighbor, Miss Pearson, would
look at him and say, "You're going to be president one day." He
remembers to this day her words and the feeling of having someone
believe in him.</TE>
<TE>   He had an uncle who played the drums, and one day Pullum, while
listening to him play, picked up a bugle that was lying on the couch.
No one had been able to get a sound out of it, but when Pullum lifted
it to his lips, he made it play. That one note, he says, changed his
life.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody started clapping. I got a positive response from
people. Before that, everything had been negative."</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, when he was in the sixth grade, he took up the
trumpet and played in the school band. He gave it up in high school,
but then one day he carried his horn to school in a paper bag and
played for the band teacher. He received more positive reinforcement.</TE>
<TE>   He started playing in the band, in street alleys, in a salsa band,
but he never considered going to college until one day when he
visited a friend who was attending Chicago State University. His
friend introduced him to one of his teachers, Marcellus Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "He was desperately serious about making music," says Brown. "He
was very talented and needed someone to point him in the right
direction."</TE>
<TE>   Brown helped Pullum receive financial aid and enroll at Chicago
State. Then a year later, just as White once had done for him, Brown
helped Pullum into the University of Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think I was going to make it," Pullum says. "The
pressure for me was that Marcellus worked really hard to get me into
college, and he told me to make sure I made room for someone else
after me. I wasn't just doing it for me, I was doing it for the next
person Marcellus sent to Michigan. I couldn't let him down."</TE>
<TE>   Pullum received his bachelor's degree and, in 1983, his master's
at Michigan. Before moving to Los Angeles, he went to Brown to
discuss how he might pay him back for all he had done.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, now 50, told Pullum he couldn't pay him back with money.
Using words that could have come out of Anderson White's mouth, Brown
said, "Help 10 other people, and we'll be even."</TE>
<TE>   Pullum couldn't stop at just 10.</TE>
<TE>   When Pullum came to Los Angeles, he thought it was to become a
musician, but over the years it is teaching that has settled into his
heart.</TE>
<TE>   "I had some friends ask me when I first started how many musicians
I was going to create, and I said I didn't care. What I'm trying to
do is create a whole person. Music is a tool. Yes, we have some
professional musicians now. That's icing on the cake. It's exciting
to turn on the television and see one of my kids play, but it's more
exciting to see a kid become a father, get a job."</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, his students have found success through music.
They became good musicians, but Pullum felt something was missing.
Too many of them, he says, were thinking only of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   That's when he started building his program around the concept of
giving back. Corey Hogan, who graduated from Washington Prep in 1997,
is a senior at UCLA. During his first three years of college, he
returned to Washington to tutor students as part of the UCLA Music
Partnership Program, which pairs college musicians with students in
six Los Angeles schools.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not enough to be successful on your own," he says. "Mr.
Pullum taught us we had to give back."</TE>
<TE>   Other former Washington students also tutor students, who then,
through the Kids Helping Kids program that Pullum has run for years,
give free lessons to young children, who perform at convalescent
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to be accountable for their own community," Pullum
says. And when the old people in the homes hear the music, he says
"you see them become energized, young again. It humbles you."</TE>
<TE>   Although Washington Prep is a magnet school for math/science,
communication arts and the performing arts, performing arts are not
funded by the Los Angeles Unified School District. A foundation known
as Friends of Washington Prep raises more than $200,000 a year to pay
for those programs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the music department suffered a blow when the building
housing their instruments burned down the night before the citywide
marching band competition. No arrests were made, but arson was
suspected. The following day, using borrowed instruments, Washington
claimed its third city title in four years.</TE>
<TE>   But as director of the Performing Arts Department, Pullum, father
of two, says he doesn't want programs to focus on competition; he
wants them to focus on young people.</TE>
<TE>   "Music is a device to raise someone's self-esteem. I try to
convince people that the skills you learn here you can use across the
board. You have to be organized, dedicated, persistent, no matter
what you do."</TE>
<TE>   For Nichol Luebrun, a junior at Washington, music is both an
escape and an opportunity. "It makes me feel like a whole different
person," she says. "Before I got into music, it was horrible. I was
hanging with gangbangers ... I was in the principal's office all the
time."</TE>
<TE>   She and senior Lorenzo Johnson Jr. hope to attend UCLA. Both want
to become teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson says he wants to make music in public schools his mission.
"The government talks about how education is first, but where do they
put all their money? Not in the schools. ... The arts are the only
means of expression for a lot of kids, especially in the inner city,
in our community, and I want to make sure all kids have an
opportunity, a way out, an escape."</TE>
<TE>   Luebrun sees teaching as a way to allow her to continue a
legacy--one that began in Detroit with a man named Anderson White,
traveled to Chicago through Marcellus Brown, then came to Los Angeles
through Fernando Pullum.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody helped me become a better person," Luebrun says. "I want
to give that gift to somebody else."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>* I love the oceans and beaches where I can go swimming and surfing,
and the snowy mountains where I can ski and snowboard, and the rocks
and hills where I can hike and climb. My cousins can build a snowman
in Chicago at the same time I go Boogie boarding in Malibu. Only in
America!</LD>
<LD>   --Anton, 6, Hawthorne</LD>
<LD>   Elementary, Beverly Hills</LD>
<TE>   * I love America because we have freedom. We have the right to
vote for people who run our government. We have the freedom to make
our own decisions about religion and where we want to live. I also
love America because it's a beautiful place to live. There are many
pretty gardens and nice schools.</TE>
<TE>   --Sara, 8, El Rodeo</TE>
<TE>   Elementary, Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   * I love America from the tall, tall mountains to the open
prairies. I love America from Canada to Mexico. I love America from
north to south and east to west, and from Washington to Texas. Why do
I love America? No. 1: I'm an American. No. 2: It's so pretty. And
No. 3: I'm free!</TE>
<TE>   --Rebecca, 8, Temple Beth Hillel</TE>
<TE>   Day School, Valley Village</TE>
<TE>   * I love America because the schools here teach me a lot. There is
food to eat and toys to play with. America has movies to see and
places to go to. I can wear whatever clothes and shoes I want.</TE>
<TE>   --Yaser, 8, Will Rogers Learning</TE>
<TE>   Center, Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   * America is a great country. Americans went to the moon in 1969.
We have a strong army. We have freedom. I love the U.S.A.!</TE>
<TE>   --Jennifer, 7, Helmers</TE>
<TE>   Elementary, Valencia</TE>
<TE>   * What I like about America is that there is a lot of good stuff
like school and houses. We have a good president. Other countries are
not like America. It has good shoes and good laws that help me
protect my freedom and safety. America has good toys too. And people
can celebrate any holiday they want.</TE>

<HD>A Beautiful Journey to Professional Nirvana</HD>
<DH>In seeing his name on the cover of a book, Akiva Goldsman
accomplished a lifelong goal. An Oscar nomination is the icing on the
cake.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a balmy Tuesday night in West Hollywood. And no one's enjoying
it more than the mid-size guy who's ambling up Sunset in navy T-shirt
and chino pants, hands in pockets, looking like he might be mentally
whistling a happy tune. Akiva Goldsman, Oscar-nominated author of the
screenplay for "A Beautiful Mind," is about to realize a dream.</LD>
<LD>   As a child in Brooklyn, Goldsman never hankered for Academy
Awards. His constant fantasy, his singular goal, his absolute most
steadfast ambition since he was 8 years old, was to someday see his
name on a book. To be the author of "something good." Now 39, he is
that and more. Here at the rambling, cluttered Book Soup--a West
Hollywood literary hub--he is about to perform the first book signing
of his life. He will autograph copies of a new paperback, the film's
screenplay (Newmarket Press, $17.95). No fanfare, no cameras, no
tickets sold. He is greeted outside by a store representative. "I'm
ready to sign," he says. "First you'll speak for a while," she says.
"Who, me? I didn't know I was speaking. OK, I can do that."</LD>
<TE>   About 40 people have waited quietly on little brown folding chairs
for almost an hour. One is there because her mother has acute
paranoia and schizophrenia, she says. Another says she has been
diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism
found in people with normal or high IQs. Some say they are working
screenwriters, who want to hear Goldsman "discuss the craft." Others
are hopefuls just starting out.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Rimmerman, an author and professor at Hobart College in
Geneva, N.Y., has come because he's filled with admiration and
indignation. He found the film "riveting," but wants to know why
Goldsman left out the fact that John Nash was bisexual for much of
his life. Katharine Kramer, daughter of producer-director Stanley
Kramer, is there to see Goldsman because "his is my favorite movie of
the year." They are old, young, thin, fat, some highly groomed and
buff, others not. There is reverence in the air, as more people
filter in and stand silently at the back. Goldsman takes the measure
of the crowd, and appears moved. He launches out:</TE>
<TE>   "I am the son of two therapists," he starts. He outlines an early
life with parents Tev Goldsman and Mira Rothenberg, pioneering child
psychologists who ran one of the earliest group homes for emotionally
disturbed kids.</TE>
<TE>   "They were kids with diagnoses that don't even exist any
more--infantile autism and childhood schizophrenia," he tells the
crowd. "These were children who never knew you were not supposed to
dream when you were awake. I lived in a household with five or seven
of these kids." They hung him out the windows, used him as a ball,
generally made him mad. Worse yet, whatever he needed from his
parents, whatever problems he had, paled in comparison to the
problems that plagued the other kids. "By the time I was 10 or 12, I
realized they had taken my parents away from me. I wanted nothing
more to do with that world. I wanted to be a writer. I had a fantasy
that someday I'd see my name on a book."</TE>
<TE>   Goldsman graduated from high school at 16--"I still had hair." In
the summer of 1983, before starting Wesleyan University in
Middletown, Conn., he visited his mother at the camp where she was
clinical director. His first evening there, the staff was
celebrating. They'd taught a child who'd been terrified of the water
to love it instead, Goldsman recalls. "In the middle of that night,
the little boy went to find that which he had learned to love. The
water. He was 8. He drowned."</TE>
<TE>   Goldsman says he stayed on at the camp for weeks and ended up
beginning what turned out to be a 10-year career working with
autistic and schizophrenic youngsters, much of it at his parents'
pioneering Blueberry Treatment Centers. (To this day, he always wears
the symbol of the Blueberry centers somewhere on his person, he
says.) He had an intense connection with one autistic boy named Eric:
"I met him when he was 5, and lying on the ground, emitting an
extraordinary, deep, agonized wail. I worked with him for the next
five years. I toilet trained him. I loved him.... " Goldsman's voice
falters, fails, he is near tears.</TE>
<TE>   He has been speaking seamlessly, to a mesmerized audience, for
half an hour. They remain soundless as he composes himself and goes
on. For a few years, he ran one of the children's mental health
facilities, he says. Then he went on to create a training model for
others working with such children.</TE>
<TE>   All that time, he kept alive the fantasy that one day he would see
his name on a good book. He went to NYU postgraduate school, where
some of his writing teachers were E.L. Doctorow, Gordon Lish,
Margaret Atwood, Russell Banks. He amassed a shoe box impressively
full of rejection slips from all the best publications. One day,
after he'd won a debate at Harvard University against a guy who
advocated mandatory mainstreaming for troubled children, he asked
himself: "What have I won? I have no kids....I had nothing I really
wanted at that point." So he enrolled in a screenwriting course that
"provided me with rules and structure--which are wildly elusive
commodities."</TE>
<TE>   He sold the first screenplay he wrote--a film called "Silent Fall"
(about an autistic youngster who's the only witness to his parents'
bloody murder). Then Joel Schumacher hired him to write "The Client,
" he says. Goldsman skips over the next few years of film writing
("Batman Forever," "A Time to Kill," "Batman &amp; Robin," to name a
few), often in association with Schumacher--except to tell the
audience that he suddenly became "a very fancy person. God, was I
fancy. I didn't know it really didn't go that way."</TE>
<TE>   He soon realized it was no longer enough to write just
anything--"that if I don't write something very particular to me, I
will have squandered this enormous opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   After reading "the excellent biography of John Nash by Sylvia
Nasar," he says, he was inspired to reflect on the great man's life:
"From genius to madness to Nobel Prize." He noticed that what was
"entirely missing from the book was Nash's inner life. Nash didn't
talk to Nasar for the book. His madness was entirely absent from it."</TE>
<TE>   Goldsman says he decided to write the film. But producers he
pitched "were thinking biopic and genius. I was thinking no biopic
and madness."</TE>
<TE>   He began to "build this construct of delusions. I made them up. I
had to. John Nash doesn't remember his delusions." The delusional
characters in the film, Goldsman says, are his own attempt to
illustrate to an audience how people with schizophrenia experience
delusions. "To show how people in this mental state do not know what
to believe any more, the total betrayal that sufferers experience--a
betrayal of their own minds."</TE>
<TE>   He asks the crowd to imagine how they would feel. "You know for
sure that you are sitting in a store called Book Soup, and you are
hearing Akiva Goldsman talk. You come back to this very street
tomorrow. You learn there is no store called Book Soup. Never has
been one. And Goldsman never talked. How would you feel?"</TE>
<TE>   He says his script was written with "blatant disregard for fact--I
threw biography out the window." He did that in order to uncover what
was the more essential truth of Nash's illness, and of his life, he
says. He took his script to the Nashes, "and they said they loved
it." They told him "it was true to the spirit of our journey."
Goldsman pauses. "I think it is true. It is not their journey, but it
is true to the spirit of it."</TE>
<TE>   From then on, Goldsman's little talk coasts all the way. He tells
the crowd that Universal green-lighted his first draft; Ron Howard
said he'd like to direct. The year he spent making the movie was in
New Jersey, near his childhood home and his mother, now in her 80s.
"My mom is in the last scene of the film," he says. "It was a coming
home in the greatest sense ... it was all that I wanted to be in
life. Now I am kind of done." Unburdened, he stops talking.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd forms a queue that wends all the way out the door.
Goldsman begins signing paperbacks, posters, original working scripts
cadged by insiders from the studios, a poignant, enlarged color photo
of a woman and her schizophrenic mother. The college professor, at
first irate that Nash's sexual ambivalence was left out of the film,
now stands in front of the screenwriter. "I thought I'd have a lot to
ask you, but I don't. After hearing you speak I completely understand
why you left some things out," he says. "I will be able to explain
this to my students."</TE>
<TE>   "I left out his first wife, his first son--I was reckless in an
intentional way," Goldsman tells him.</TE>
<TE>   The next man asks him to sign the paperback "To my former
teacher.... " Goldsman looks up, says, "Oh, my God, it's my high
school English teacher from Saint Anne's in Brooklyn." He rises from
behind the desk to embrace Mark Haefele, now City Hall columnist for
the L.A. Weekly paper. He asks for Haefele's phone number, says he
wants to get together. "Jennifer Connelly [who plays Alicia Nash in
the film] went to the same school," Goldsman tells a bystander.</TE>
<TE>   Goldsman is alternately adorable, compassionate,
comedic--depending on the person at the table. For the young woman
diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, he suggests "a really smart guy
at UCLA who might help answer some questions"--and then spells the
doctor's name slowly. A Nigerian woman learning Hebrew asks him to
sign in that language. "Don't know how, but I'll do it in English,"
he says with a smile. Another person asks him to write "To a
beautiful mind."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know you well enough to write that," he says with a
chuckle, as he writes "Good luck" instead.</TE>
<TE>   A tall, slim woman has positioned herself at the very end of the
line. Deliberately. When it's her turn at the table, she slants her
body toward Goldsman, shakes her auburn curls, and whispers that she
too is from New York, that she too is not scared of talking to people
she doesn't know.</TE>
<TE>   "You were so charming tonight, so self-effacing, so bright," she
says in a low, husky voice. "I hope you don't find me too forward,
but I'd really like to get together some time and talk." She hands
him her card, a Goldsman groupie. Suddenly, it's clear we are back in
the heart of Hollywood.</TE>

<HD>Amid All the Talking, Meaning of 'PC' Got Lost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandy Banks</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is one of those phrases we throw around reflexively, convinced
that we share with our fellow citizens a collective notion of what it
means. But every now and then a debate emerges on radio talk shows,
in the workplace, in news stories or magazines.</LD>
<LD>   What does "politically correct" mean to us these days? Is
political correctness an outlook, a set of values, a political
ideology?</LD>
<LD>   I found myself facing those questions last week, when several
readers used the phrase to characterize a column I'd written
suggesting that a woman whose drinking binge resulted in her
children's death deserved more than a year in jail.</LD>
<TE>   "Thank you for taking what is probably a politically incorrect
stand--demanding justice for those babies," wrote Loretta Moss.</TE>
<TE>   "You are right on with your assessment," said Irene Baker. "It may
not be politically correct to take such an attitude, but I'm anti-PC
anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe I'm a bit out of step, but I don't consider valuing
children's lives and touting personal accountability to be
anti-anything. What, I wondered, does politically correct really
mean?</TE>
<TE>   The phrase was first coined in the 1980s, during campus debates
over freedom of speech. Then, academic institutions were moving to
ban "hate speech" that expressed intolerance for any racial, ethnic
or special interest group. Opponents charged that the new rules
promoted "political correctness" at the expense of intellectual
exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Soon the phrase "politically correct" became associated with a
liberal political agenda that embraced concepts such as feminism and
multiculturalism. Liberals complained that conservatives hijacked the
term and used it to suggest that ideas once considered politically
progressive were, instead, the result of mindless pandering.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the phrase has morphed even more, so that it represents a
valueless sort of uber tolerance; a refusal to condemn anyone for
anything. And it has infiltrated our conversation. A check of Los
Angeles Times files shows the terms "politically correct" or
"politically incorrect" cropping up just 10 times in the newspaper in
1988. In 1989 it was 30, the next year 64. By 1992, they appeared 461
times, in stories on every subject from sports to music to fashion to
religion. And since the start of 2002, we've deemed something
politically correct or incorrect more than 60 times, almost once each
day.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Maher, host of the television talk show "Politically
Incorrect," characterizes political correctness as "the elevation of
sensitivity over truth." He says his brand of political incorrectness
sets him apart from the crowd. But is that really true anymore? "It's
all gotten pretty confusing," admits Bruce Herschenson, conservative
political commentator now teaching at Pepperdine University. "I
stopped watching 'Politically Incorrect' because it became so
politically correct, it made no sense to me."</TE>
<TE>   Some say we can blame the "talk show mentality" that pervades
society. We've been primed to view the world as left versus right,
good against evil. We've been deluded by reliance on sound bites into
thinking that a single view on a single subject sets your place on
the political spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   And the term "politically correct'' has become our shorthand way
of dismissing some idea or person with whom we disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "The charge of political correctness wipes away all the thinking
that led to those views ... by implying that they are merely
fashionable, that they don't have content, that they are not
legitimate dissent," says professor Martin H. Kaplan, associate dean
of USC Annenberg School for Communication. "That diminishes their
power and elevates the opposing view."</TE>
<TE>   It stifles debate, Kaplan says, by casting some in the role of
unthinking sycophants and others as brave renegades. "It's a way of
saying, 'If you hold that view, you're not a free thinker.' No one
wants to be labeled that way."</TE>
<TE>   Now, the battle over political correctness is claiming prisoners
on both sides, as our cultural landscape shifts and values once
considered unpopular--such as patriotism and religious faith--have
emerged to carry the day.</TE>
<TE>   So we see an instructor at an Orange County community college
temporarily yanked from the classroom for insulting Muslim students
as he denounces terrorism, and a university professor in Texas
threatened with firing after he protests the war in Afghanistan and
insults our sense of patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   And we wind up uncertain over whether it was the political
correctness or incorrectness of his stance on issues such as gay
rights and abortion that cost Richard Riordan a shot at the
governor's seat last week. And we wonder whether political
correctness really has anything to do with politics.</TE>
<TE>   Because my views--and probably yours--are drawn not from politics,
but from values and experiences. And if they are conservative some
times and liberal others; correct in some eyes and incorrect in
others; messy and unpredictable and contradictory ... well so,
sometimes, is life.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For their extraordinary dedication to education and the enhancement
of the quality of life of children in Southern California, Marion and
John E. Anderson have received KCET's 2002 Visionary Award. More than
400 supporters packed the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel ballroom for
the tribute, which raised more than $900,000 for the public
television station.</LD>
<LD>   "If they wanted to, the Andersons could be honored every night of
the week and twice a night on weekends," said KCET board chairman
Bruce Ramer. "But that's not why they do what they do; they do it
because they believe so deeply in giving back the benefits of their
own hard work that did not come easily." Among the beneficiaries of
their largesse are the Anderson Graduate School of Management at
UCLA, the Anderson Building at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, the
YMCA and the Music Center of Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   "What makes them remarkable," said Ramer, "is that they are
teaching their children and grandchildren the rewards of giving by
creating a family partnership in which each member recommends a
donation to a worthwhile cause."</LD>
<TE>   Jess Marlow, co-anchor of KCET's "Life &amp; Times Tonight," emceed
the doings Tuesday, which included accolades from KCET president Al
Jerome, board member Peg Yorkin, Sherry Lansing and Bill Friedkin,
Marcia Hobbs, Merle and Peter Mullin, a video tribute created for the
occasion by David Nemer, and performances by the UCLA marching band
and the UCLA Alumni String Quartet.</TE>
<TE>   Along with two generations of the Anderson clan, attendees
included Sherry and Tom Barrat, Barbara Goen, Robin and Gerald
Parsky, Carol and Jim Collins, Joanne and Roger Kozberg, Paula Kent
Meehan, Louise and John Bryson, Jim Kindel, Phyllis and Jim Easton,
Aulana and Bruce Peters, Victoria Simms, Stuart Siegel, Yoshie and
Kaoru Hayama and UCLA chancellor Albert Carnesale and his fiancee,
Robin Gerber, who revealed that they'll tie the knot on April 6.</TE>

<TE>   Burn Foundation</TE>
<TE>   In a benefit that raised more than $500,000 for the Children's
Burn Foundation, cousins and kindred spirits Brindell Gott- lieb and
Sheila Weisman were honored for their longtime devotion to children's
causes.</TE>
<TE>   A black-tie crowd of more than 600 turned out for the event at the
Beverly Hilton Ballroom. Gottlieb and Weisman serve on the council of
the foundation, which was established in 1985 by plastic surgeon Dr.
A. Richard Grossman and actor McLean Stevenson to meet the needs of
children who have suffered severe burns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to look at the innocent face of a young burn survivor,
and what is even more shocking is to know that the child was injured
intentionally by a caregiver or relative," said Tommy Hawkins, a
former foundation honoree, who emceed the event. "The statistics are
staggering," he said. "Every year 440,000 children suffer burns
requiring professional treatment, almost half of them under the age
of 4."</TE>
<TE>   Foundation board president Douglas Mancino noted that since the
foundation was restructured in 1995 it has raised more than $5
million to aid young patients seen at the Grossman Burn Center at
Sherman Oaks Hospital as well as other centers from Fresno to San
Diego. The Feb. 27 event was chaired by Lynda Fadel and Barbara Fodor
and council president Carol Mancino. The dinner chairs were L.A. Fire
Chief William R. Bamattre, Joanne and Roger Kozberg and Andrea and
John Van de Kamp.</TE>

<TE>   Youth Symphony</TE>
<TE>   Renowned pianist Misha Dichter--who played his first concert here
while a student at Beverly Hills High School--made a rare Southern
California appearance last weekend to benefit the American Youth
Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   "These young people are fantastically gifted and respected by
their peers," said Herb Gelfand, symphony board chairman. "Last
season we had over 300 applications for just 20 openings. Today more
than 100 of our alumni are playing in great orchestras around the
world--11 of them with the L.A. Philharmonic."</TE>
<TE>   The concert at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion featured Liszt's
Piano Concerto No. 2 in A major and Dvorak's masterpiece Symphony No.
8 in G major, conducted by music director Alexander Treger.</TE>
<TE>   The evening's honoree, Mehli Mehta, who founded the orchestra in
1964 and led it until his retirement in 1998, was sidelined by
illness. Elizabeth Pitcairn, his former concertmistress, accepted the
award on his behalf from AYS board member Leah Mendelsohn.</TE>
<TE>   Dichter and his wife, Cipa, also a concert pianist, stopped in at
the post-concert dinner held in the pavilion's Grand Hall, then
dashed to catch a red-eye flight home to New York. Yvette Fierstein
chaired the dinner for 400, which raised more than $190,000.</TE>
<TE>   Spotted in the crowd were Mary Levin Cutler and husband Gilbert
Cutler, Milla Treger, Gabriella Bashner, Dhunmai and Phiroze Dalal,
Lois Levin, Leah Brockman, Marion and Ernest Goldenfeld, Hakeem
Holloway, Vicki Jacobs, Teddi Silverman and Jack Shine.</TE>

<TE>   Golden Opportunity</TE>
<TE>   Olympic gold medal winner Paul Kariya, a member of the winning
Canadian hockey team and captain of Anaheim's Mighty Ducks, was the
star attraction at a Rio-themed casino benefit for the Orange County
Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. He sat at a
gaming table in the ballroom at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport
Beach, autographing jerseys and playing blackjack with dozens of
admiring fans.</TE>
<TE>   Winning the gold with his fellow Canadians was a thrill, Kariya
said. "But I'm not winning tonight. I'm a bad gambler."</TE>
<TE>   The athlete was among the more than 20 Mighty Ducks who joined MS
Society supporters on March 1 to try their luck in a Vegas-style
casino and help raise $75,000 for patient services.</TE>
<TE>   Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, debilitating disease of the
central nervous system with no known cause or cure. It affects more
than 450,000 people in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Services provided by the society include self-help programs led by
peers who have learned to cope with the unpredictable effects of the
disease, said Jamie McDonald, chapter president.</TE>

<TE>   Championing Children</TE>
<TE>   Child advocates Brian and Anissa Gurnee of Newport Beach received
the Children's Champion Award from Court Appointed Special Advocates
during its black-tie gala at the Sutton Place Hotel in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Gross proceeds of $310,000 from the benefit will go toward CASA
programs that recruit, train and supervise community volunteers to

<LD>"Matt!" Rachel called. "What did Mom leave for an after-school snack?
Mali and I are hungry."</LD>
<LD>   Matt came into the family room.</LD>
<LD>   "Hi Mali," he said. "It's nice to see you again."</LD>
<TE>   "Matt, you didn't answer my question," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh!" Matt said. "Here's the answer." And he handed Rachel a piece
of paper.</TE>
<TE>   "Not again!" Rachel said. And she sighed.</TE>
<TE>   "What is it?" Mali asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Matt made up a crossword puzzle," Rachel said. "To find out what
Mom left for us to eat, we'll have to solve the puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   "But there aren't any clues on the paper," Mali said.</TE>
<TE>   "Matt will give us the clues," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh!" Mali said. "That sounds like fun. Let's both do the puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   "All right," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   Mali got a pencil. Then she and Rachel sat down at the game table.</TE>
<TE>   "We're ready for the first clue, Matt," Mali said.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," Matt said. "Number 4, across. A fruit that is used in a
shortcake dessert."</TE>
<TE>   "Hmmm," Mali said. "Strawberry shortcake is the only one I can
think of."</TE>
<TE>   She counted the spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "It fits!" she said. And she printed s-t-r-a-w-b-e-r-r-y.</TE>
<TE>   "Good for you, Mali," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Next clue," Matt said. "Number 2, across. Cold that comes in
cubes."</TE>
<TE>   "That's easy," Mali said. And she printed the answer in the
spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "Right!" Matt said. "Next. Number 1, down. The coldest place in
the house."</TE>
<TE>   Mali frowned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 'freezer,'" Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   Mali nodded and printed the word in the spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "Last clue," Matt said. "Number 3, down. It's the part of milk
that can be whipped."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel and Mali looked at each other. They looked at the puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel counted the spaces. Then she laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "I know!" she said. And she ran to get their after-school snack.</TE>
<TE>   Do you know what Rachel and Mali had for an after-school snack?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Antique-Expert Twins Offer Twice the Entertainment Value</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JURA KONCIUS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you don't know who the Treasure Twins are, stay tuned.</LD>
<LD>   Leigh and Leslie Keno, 44, identical twin-antiques appraisers,
have been revving up the restrained and refined world of 18th century
ball-and-claw feet and Philadelphia highboys. With their
central-casting good looks and easy banter, they are already well
known to the millions of fans addicted to PBS' "Antiques Roadshow."</LD>
<LD>   Leigh owns Leigh Keno American Antiques in New York City. Leslie
is Sotheby's senior specialist and director of business development
for Americana. Together they also are part of the team of appraisers
who travel around the country examining family heirlooms and attic
treasures that people drag before them, and dazzling the TV audience
with their immediate and blunt (but good-humored) assessments: Yes,
that tea table you snagged at a yard sale for $24 is a 200-year-old
treasure worth $75,000; No, your great-grandpa's prized Civil War
rifle is an obvious fake.</LD>
<TE>   The brothers are clearly on a roll. They have written a book on
the roots of their collecting obsession and made a raucous appearance
on "The Tonight With Jay Leno" (on which they were filmed riding
around to L.A. tag sales with Leno and admiring his vintage car
collection). In January, they launched a sassy antiques column in
House Beautiful called He Said, He Said.</TE>
<TE>   The book "Hidden Treasures: Searching for Masterpieces of American
Furniture" (Warner Books, $29.95), written with Joan Barzilay Freund,
recounts their childhood on a farm in New York, where parents Norma
and Ronald Keno collected and sold Americana, taking their kids along
with them to flea markets and antiques shows.</TE>
<TE>   The towhead twins grew up digging for 19th century marbles and
scavenging hand-wrought barn hinges. They studied decorative arts
books and kept copious journals of their finds.</TE>
<TE>   A collection of salt-glazed stoneware they gathered in their teens
eventually helped pay their college tuition. Both went on to work at
New York auction houses and traveled extensively. (And successfully:
They once found valuable antique chairs in a chicken coop in New
Jersey and a 1740s bookcase in Paris that was auctioned at Sotheby's
for the owners for $8.2 million.)</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, they were asked to become part of an American remake of a
popular BBC show of the same name. "Antiques Roadshow," a jewel in
the PBS crown, is now in its sixth season.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers were made for the limelight. They are deeply
knowledgeable, funny, breezily articulate and always perfectly
turned-out.</TE>
<TE>   "This show has increased their notoriety," says the show's senior
publicist, Judy Matthews. "They love the twin part--not that it
diminishes their expertise and the reason that they are successful.
They are a novelty act."</TE>
<TE>   We talked to them in a three-way phone interview (no easy
assignment with identical-sounding twins on the line from Manhattan).</TE>
<TE>   Q. Why is "Antiques Roadshow" so popular?</TE>
<TE>   A. Leslie: It certainly struck a nerve in America. A lot of our
viewers are baby boomers; I think we all grew up with our
grandparents' things around. It's a perfect formula for TV. It
combines the treasure hunting, the lottery-ticket aspect with the
possibility of having a small fortune and education and learning. It
has suspense. It's a perfect formula for success.</TE>
<TE>   A. Leigh: The show has such high ratings, even without sex or
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Q. What style of furniture is hot in America right now?</TE>
<TE>   A. Leigh: I think the Queen Anne style has always been popular and
still is. People love curves in furniture because curves remind us of
ourselves. A chair has nice knees and ankles; we use those terms to
describe humans.</TE>
<TE>   Q. What do you think of being celebrities?</TE>
<TE>   A. Leigh: We are not celebrities. We are used-furniture salesmen.</TE>
<TE>   A. Leslie: It's nice used furniture.</TE>

<KH>JOHN BALZAR</KH>
<HD>MIA: A War on Greed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I could say, I told you so. But so what? This was an easy one to see
coming: Greed still rules. Congress and the administration are too
timid and too beholden to confront Enron on the scale it deserves.</LD>
<LD>   The big issues of corporate citizenship and executive compensation
are passing right over the heads of our elected leadership. For many
Americans, the Enron scandal and everything we've learned since hit
our society with a staggering blow. We were rocked down deep in our
beliefs. Our sense of social integrity was undermined, not to mention
the security of thousands of people.</LD>
<LD>   But in this case, Washington is too deeply infiltrated to go to
battle.</LD>
<TE>   If President Bush had been as tepid in responding to Al Qaeda as
he has been to Enron et al, you could lop the zero off his 80%
approval rating. As for Congress? Milquetoast.</TE>
<TE>   Is it enough, or 1/1,000th enough, to say that if you're an
executive on the scam you have to give back your bonus and your
country club membership? The president's proposal is about as
fangless as telling burglars that they have to give the loot back if
they get caught.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, but they're going to save our 401(k) plans in Washington. Ha.
Imposing formulaic diversity in our retirement investments is the
heavy hand of government clamping down on the wrong neck. If I
believe in the Tribune Co. and want to stake my future with my
employer, should government tell me I cannot? Do we order Microsoft
workers to invest in other companies?</TE>
<TE>   Government--that is, us together acting in our collective
interest--owes the country a free-enterprise system we can trust. One
motivated by honorable incentives. We don't need Washington to devise
an investment plan for us.</TE>
<TE>   The lessons of Enron and Global Crossing and the rest are simple:
Corporate gamesmanship has wandered out of control. Public
corporations and their officers have a responsibility to the public,
and when they abuse it, the ax must fall just as surely as it does on
the thug who snatches your purse.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is correct in saying we don't need more tedious investor
lawsuits. But he is wrong in overlooking that our social system,
which includes the business of business, is fundamentally based on
checks and balances. We desperately need some now.</TE>
<TE>   This is not liberal corporate-bashing. This tired partisan
argument about freedom versus regulation is the reason we're in this
fix. The most conservative idea in the free-enterprise playbook is
honesty. If you suggest that this is a matter of interpretation or
discussion, then you're no different than those excuse-makers who
would forgive the armed robber because he got picked on in grade
school.</TE>
<TE>   The securities laws of the U.S. were written to guarantee that
investors have access to the basic financial information about public
companies. Like worms in the hull of a wooden boat, lawyers and
lobbyists and their courtesans in government have spent a
half-century hollowing out the law with exceptions, loopholes and
qualifiers--all of them tantalizing enticements to test the limits.</TE>
<TE>   To keep this leaky ship from sinking, what we need now are not
ever more complicated regulations, which is Washington's way of
trying to paper over this scandal. We need far fewer pages of
regulation, and better ones. We need to go back to fresh planking:
Corporations reporting their earnings and obligations. Those who make
mistakes should be accountable. Fraud is a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Stealing with a fountain pen is no different than with a six-gun,
as the old folk song goes. No more of this polite white-collar crime
that is pardoned by paying a fine and admitting no guilt.</TE>
<TE>   That is the "check." Honest, well-managed companies thrive. As for
the "balance," we need to redirect the incentives for economic
competition.</TE>
<TE>   How many millions of dollars are enough for the wheeler-dealers?
We should be careful not to lump all entrepreneurs in the same rotten
barrel, but it's obvious now that the fiercest competition in
American boardrooms is for the singularly venal purpose of obtaining
the biggest salary, the most overinflated bonus, the largest stock
options, the most outrageous pension, the fanciest ranch in Aspen.</TE>
<TE>   Give us back a progressive tax structure. Ratchet up those
brackets so that anything over $10 million--or $50 million, or
whatever million--is taxed mercilessly. Remember those 90%-plus tax
rates for millionaires in the salad days of the 1950s?</TE>
<TE>   If they cannot keep the money--worse, if they have to give it to
government--corporate leaders will stop competing so frantically for
it. Put the cash in R&amp;D, or modernization, and let's watch as
executives try to outdo themselves for something better, like
customer service or product quality.</TE>

<HD>The Lucha Libre That Is Latino Politics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You've heard the one about the sleeping giant. But how about lucha
libre?</LD>
<LD>   For several elections now I've tried to phase out the hoary
cliches political analysts use to categorize the rapidly growing
Latino vote in this country. Variations on "the sleeping giant is now
awake" are the most common. But that metaphor is increasingly
inaccurate because it implies that Latinos are a single-minded voting
bloc.</LD>
<LD>   The reality is much more complicated than that; Latinos are just
as varied in their political views and voting habits as other
Americans.</LD>
<TE>   Last week's California primary election--and next Tuesday's
primary voting in Texas, the state with the second-biggest number of
Latino voters--brings to mind a better metaphor. Think of Latino
politics as a free-for-all, like the popular Mexican wrestling shows
known as lucha libre.</TE>
<TE>   Like the sleeping giant in the old cliche, wrestlers are big and
strong. But in lucha libre, several can be inside the ring at the
same time. And when a match really gets going, it's hard to determine
not just who is going to win but who is on which side at any given
moment.</TE>
<TE>   Consider some California results from last week:</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Council President Alex Padilla and his political
mentor, state Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City), suffered a
setback in their effort to build a Latino political machine in the
San Fernando Valley. Cardenas narrowly lost his bid for a vacant City
Council seat to Wendy Greuel.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the woman that Cardenas endorsed to replace him in the
state Legislature, Yolanda Fuentes, lost to San Fernando Mayor Cindy
Montanez. The results create a new dynamic in Los Angeles City Hall,
where Padilla's hold on the council presidency may now be at risk.</TE>
<TE>   Another local Latino political brawl that got national attention
was in a new congressional district in southeast Los Angeles County,
which sprawls from Whittier to Hawaiian Gardens. That is where Linda
Sanchez, a labor union official and sister of Orange County
Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez, held off a challenge from South Gate
City Councilman Hector de la Torre.</TE>
<TE>   With fund-raising help from her sister, Linda Sanchez won by
linking De La Torre with the notoriously nasty politics of South
Gate, where virulent infighting has led to a corruption probe by the
Los Angeles district attorney. Ironically, De La Torre is one of the
few South Gate officials who has not been dragged into that probe.
But that didn't help him against the Sanchez sisters' tag team.</TE>
<TE>   There are at least two contests in next Tuesday's primary in Texas
that also fit the lucha libre metaphor.</TE>
<TE>   The big matchup in that state is at the top of the ticket, where
two Mexican American Democrats are vying for a chance to take on
Republican Gov. Rick Perry in November.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, former state Atty. Gen. Dan Morales, of San Antonio, and
Tony Sanchez, a Laredo oilman and rancher, faced off in televised
debates with a uniquely Tejano twist. The first hour was in English,
the second in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Texans are more at ease with English-Spanish bilingualism than
Californians, so the campaign there has been heated in both
languages. Morales accuses Sanchez, the scion of a wealthy south
Texas family, of trying to buy the election. Sanchez says Morales is
"embarrassed to be Hispanic."</TE>
<TE>   But the Texas race I find the most fascinating is further down the
ballot. U.S. Rep. Henry Bonilla, one of three Latino Republicans in
Congress, represents the 23rd District near San Antonio. He faces no
opposition and will be nominated for another term. The unopposed
Democrat who will run against Bonilla in November is former Texas
Secretary of State Henry Cuellar.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, Cuellar is getting financial help from a political
action committee affiliated with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus,
of which Bonilla is a member.</TE>
<TE>   The PAC in question is known by the acronym BOLD, for Build Our
Leadership Diversity. It is headed by California Rep. Joe Baca
(D-Rialto), who makes no apologies for opposing a Latino Republican
if it will help Democrats win the six new seats they need to take
control of Congress in November.</TE>
<TE>   Baca also points to congressional votes on issues impacting small
businesses and bilingual education where Bonilla voted contrary to
the majority of Hispanic Caucus members, 18 of whom are Democrats.
"He's a Johnny-come-lately," Baca says of his Republican colleague.
"Too lately."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Bonilla has blasted the Hispanic Caucus for
partisanship in a statement issued by his office. "Simply put, the
Hispanic Caucus is Democrats first, second and foremost," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With all due respect to Bonilla, it must also be noted that the 21
Hispanic Caucus members are, first and foremost, politicians. And
politics, like lucha libre, is a contact sport.</TE>

<HD>Why Get in Trouble When You Can Lie?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Yesterday my wife and I discovered that one of our closet doors was
broken. After a bit of back and forth, it emerged that our older son
had broken it when he was roughhousing with his brother. He hadn't
told us, he said, because he was afraid of getting in trouble.</LD>
<LD>   I thought of that when I saw this story:</LD>
<LD>   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP)--A nurse's aide hit a homeless man with her
car, drove home with him stuck headfirst in her broken windshield,
and ignored his cries for help as he bled to death in her garage over
the next two or three days, police say.</LD>
<TE>   One of the most disturbing features of the story is that the
nurse's aide, Chante Mallard, allegedly told police she periodically
went into the garage to apologize to the man for hitting him and
leaving him to die in her windshield.</TE>
<TE>   Someone had taught her, no doubt, that if you do something bad you
should apologize, thus accepting responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Philosophers and pundits like to rant in the teeth of modernity
that no one takes responsibility for anything anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Former drug czar William Bennett, for example, has made a career
of bemoaning our era and our former president on these grounds.</TE>
<TE>   But it's always been hard to take responsibility for something
bad. The first impulse really is to lie or say nothing, to be
invisible to moral radar with your stealth technology.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know Chante Mallard, but I picture her letting the man
bleed and starve in her garage because she didn't want to get into
trouble. It was a lie of silence.</TE>
<TE>   When philosophers discuss good and evil, they often do it, as
Aristotle did, in terms of virtues such as courage or temperance.
Others, called utilitarians, say that you must relieve as much
suffering and cause as much pleasure as possible. Yet others, such as
Immanuel Kant, say that you must do what is in accordance with duty
or a moral law that ultimately has its origin in God.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt Chante Mallard fails on all counts. But the various
theories, though they can condemn her, don't explain exactly what is
wrong with Mallard. The best way to say what Mallard allegedly did is
to say that she couldn't face or tell the truth, which was that she
did something wrong or harmful.</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to predict that when she stands trial for murder, she
will plead insanity and enumerate a variety of psychological
problems. When finally arrested, she allegedly told police that she
had been drinking and taking Ecstasy. The drinking and drugs are
likely to figure in her defense.</TE>
<TE>   Then she'll be claiming "diminished responsibility" on the grounds
that her mental state did not allow her to fully intend her action,
or that she could not understand her action's moral implications.
That goes for her friends, too, who allegedly helped her dump the
body.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps responsibility does not actually require sanity.
Perhaps we are responsible for what we do no matter what our state of
mind at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps all that responsibility asserts is that the actions we
take are our own actions. Perhaps taking responsibility--on the
trivial level that my son needed to or on the monstrous level that
Chante Mallard needs to--is saying the horrible truth and taking the
consequences.</TE>

<HD>Ideology Hiding Behind a Word</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN V. WHITBECK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia</DL>
<LD>The greatest threat to world peace today is clearly "terrorism"--not
the behavior to which the word is applied but the word itself.</LD>
<LD>   For years, people have recited the truism that "one man's
terrorist is another man's freedom fighter." However, with the
world's sole superpower declaring an open-ended, worldwide war on
terrorism, the notorious subjectivity of this word is no longer a
joke.</LD>
<LD>   The word is dangerous because many people apply it to whatever
they hate as a way of avoiding and discouraging rational discussion
and, frequently, excusing their own illegal and immoral behavior.</LD>
<TE>   There is no shortage of precise language to describe the diverse
acts to which the word "terrorism" is often applied. "Mass murder,"
"assassination," "arson" and "sabotage" are available. However, such
precise formulations do not carry the overwhelming, demonizing and
thought-deadening impact of the word "terrorism," which is, of
course, precisely the charm of the word for its more cynical and
unprincipled abusers.</TE>
<TE>   Most acts to which the word "terrorism" is applied are tactics of
the weak, usually against the strong. Such acts are not a tactic of
choice but of last resort. To cite one example, the Palestinians
would certainly prefer to be able to fight for their freedom using
F-16s, Apache attack helicopters and laser-guided missiles such as
those the U.S. provides to Israel. If the U.S. gave such weapons to
the Palestinians as well, the problem of suicide bombers would be
solved.</TE>
<TE>   Until the Palestinians can see some credible hope for a decent
future, no one should be surprised that they use the weapons-delivery
system available to them--their own bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, virtually every recognized state confronting an
insurgency or separatist movement has jumped on the war-on-terrorism
bandwagon, branding its domestic opponents "terrorists" and taking
the position that, since no one dares to criticize the U.S. for doing
whatever it deems necessary in its war on terrorism, no one should
criticize whatever they now do to suppress their own terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Even while accepting that many people labeled terrorists are
genuinely reprehensible, it should be recognized that respect for
human rights isn't likely to be enhanced by this apparent carte
blanche seized by the strong to crush the weak as they see fit.</TE>
<TE>   If everyone recognized that the word "terrorism" is fundamentally
an epithet and a term of abuse with no intrinsic meaning, there would
be no more reason to worry about the word now than prior to Sept. 11.
However, with the U.S. relying on the word to assert an absolute
right to attack any country it dislikes, many people around the world
feel a sense of terror as to where the U.S. is taking the world.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Bush administration appears to be feeding the U.S.
Constitution and America's traditions of civil liberties, due process
and the rule of law into a shredder--mostly to domestic applause or
acquiescence. Who would have imagined that 19 men armed only with
knives could accomplish so much, provoking a response beyond their
wildest dreams, which threatens to be vastly more damaging to their
enemies even than their own appalling acts?</TE>
<TE>   If the world is to avoid a descent into anarchy, in which the only
rule is "might makes right," every "retaliation" provokes a
"counter-retaliation" and a genuine "war of civilizations" is
ignited, the world--and particularly the U.S.--must recognize that
"terrorism" is simply a subjective epithet, not an objective reality
and certainly not an excuse to suspend all the rules of international
law and domestic civil liberties that have, until now, made at least
some parts of our planet decent places to live.</TE>

<LD>With more sky marshals boarding commercial flights and stronger doors
on cockpits, U.S. skies are certainly safer than they were last fall.
Let's not kid ourselves, though. As the seven shutdowns of entire
terminals due to security lapses at Los Angeles International Airport
in the last two weeks have shown, nerves are still jittery and
Washington's new Transportation Security Administration still has
glaring safety holes to close.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the first reforms, including the sky marshals and the new
doors, were widely supported. But President Bush should lend his
weight to at least two more controversial ones:</LD>
<LD>   * Training security screeners to effectively use the high-tech
scanners installed at major airports to detect explosives and weapons
in luggage. This month the government began recruiting some 30,000
federal security screeners at salaries from $13 to $20 an
hour--significantly higher than the fast-food wages that baggage
screeners had been earning. However, Transportation Secretary Norman
Y. Mineta has yet to explain how his agency will train screeners to
use the new CTX scanners--complex instruments similar to the CAT
scanners that hospital workers spend years learning how to use. Lack
of training, not an instrument  flaw, is the fundamental reason why
the scanners failed anonymous testing by the Federal Aviation
Administration.</LD>
<TE>   * Giving pilots more tools to foil hijack attempts. In the last
few weeks, hundreds of pilots have posted anguished complaints on the
FAA's Web site. They allege that the agency has shrugged off their
pleas for permission to carry firearms since 1999, when a delirious
passenger barged into the cockpit of an Alaska Airlines jet and
wrestled with the captain and co-pilot. As one pilot wrote
anonymously, referring to the fact that U.S. combat jets are now on
patrol ready to shoot down  hijacked airplanes: ''Arm the pilots. I
would rather risk a stray shot in the cabin than a Sidewinder
[missile] up the engine exhaust.''</TE>
<TE>   Airlines and Mineta adamantly oppose pilot firearms, fearing that
bullets would dangerously damage planes and prompt lawsuits if
passengers were struck. The airlines and the FAA should at least let
pilots carry tasers--devices that can deliver high-voltage jolts to
temporarily disable attackers.</TE>
<TE>   There is much to reassure travelers in the progress toward safer
skies. Still, the raw frustration of the pilots' comments to the FAA
shows that the people who know the most are far from satisfied.
Cockpit guns may not be the answer, but the pilots should not be
forced to fend off intruders with their bare hands.</TE>

<HD>Belmont: Take the Next Step</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District is asking teachers, students,
parents and other taxpayers to trust that it can capably and safely
complete the Belmont Learning Complex despite its poor history on a
project that has been nothing but a trail of trouble and broken
promises. That's a big leap. But it may be possible if the district
can negotiate an agreement with a competent developer that guarantees
safety, an ironclad maximum cost, unyielding independent oversight
and full liability protection over the life of the high school. That
is what Supt. Roy Romer says he can deliver. If so, it will be  a
180-degree turnaround for the school district.</LD>
<TE>   The new Belmont was supposed to open in 1999, allowing thousands
of students bused away from overcrowded neighborhood campuses to stay
closer to home. They're still waiting. Romer is set on resurrecting
Belmont, now a collection of half-finished buildings sitting on an
abandoned oil field contaminated with potentially explosive methane
gas. In theory, well-tested technology exists to fix the
environmental problems, which were ignored during the original
construction. In practice, completing this school just west of
downtown will require a dedicated "A team" of outside experts to
design, build, operate and maintain it safely. Such an expectation
would have been laughable a few years ago, under the different
leadership that led Belmont to disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Today, it is a serious question for the school board, which is
scheduled to vote on it Tuesday. The board should allow the
superintendent to negotiate a contract with his chosen developer,
then it should evaluate the results and go from there. What the board
and the state's safety overseers need to see are a firm contract and,
after that, detailed plans.</TE>
<TE>   There is an old rule of thumb for estimates for huge public
projects. It goes like this: Double the numbers. Double the time.
Hold your breath. That applies easily to Belmont. In 1994, the
original estimate was $60 million. The district has already spent
$154 million, and the proposed fix is estimated to cost $67 million
to $87 million. No numbers can be trusted until the district
negotiates a fixed maximum price from a developer willing to assume
the risk.</TE>
<TE>   The design, the construction, the monitoring and everything else
must be approved by the California Department of Toxic Substances
Control, the state agency that originally recommended a halt to the
flawed project. State law now gives substantial jurisdiction over
this project to the department, which has a reputation for upholding
public health and safety. One promising suggestion would have USC
engineering professors monitor a new venting system, starting with
design and continuing for the long term.</TE>
<TE>   If each step is successfully completed in the fullest possible
public view, public confidence will incrementally return. The
district's tentative successes on primary-grade reading scores and
its starts toward building other schools are causes for hope.</TE>
<TE>   Romer understands that his reputation is on the line and that any
new Belmont failure would be disastrous not just for the school
system but for the city. That said, the school board should launch
the next step of this project but not provide any blank checks.</TE>

<HD>A Hand for the Left Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's get something clear left off the bat: Society is biased against
left- handers in language, attitude and  social and physical
structures. That needs to change. So, many thanks to UCLA's Daniel
Geschwind and colleagues for their new study confirming the genetic
component of brain structures, destigmatizing and suggesting among
other things that left-handedness is not some willful decision or
environmental accident.</LD>
<LD>   The findings continue medicine's gentle study of the brain's
complex engineering. They also suggest intriguing avenues for future
research on why an elite 10% of the population becomes left-handed
while everyone else, like Dr. Geschwind himself, gets stuck in the
boring majority.</LD>
<LD>   What's clear is that right-handers designed and built our society.
Where's your car gearshift? The radio? Seen many left-handed
dictionary or address book tabs lately? Try pulling open most
building doors with your left hand. Turn over a check; the endorsing
line is just right for--my, what a surprise!--right-handed signers.
In fact, the bank's little counter pen is probably perfectly placed
for righties and the chain too short for lefties. You'll look hard
for left-handed fishing reels, power saws or stove mitts with thumb
and Teflon positioned for lefties.</LD>
<TE>   And it's been this way for centuries--gauche is French for left
and awkward. Latin for left is sinister, which explains why wedding
bands go on the left hand and spilled salt goes over the left
shoulder, both to ward off evil.</TE>
<TE>   For generations teachers tried to break left-handed writers;
fortunately, that didn't change Lewis Carroll, Mark Twain,
Michelangelo, Cole Porter, Leonardo da Vinci. Being gauche didn't
seem to thwart Napoleon, Alexander the Great, Norman Schwarzkopf--or
Babe Ruth, Sandy Koufax and Pele. Left-handed talkers dominate TV in
daytime (Oprah) and nighttime (Jay Leno, David Letterman, Ted
Koppel). Never mind their politics, Presidents Truman, Ford, Bush I
and Clinton were lefties (so too James Garfield and onetime
presidential candidate Ross Perot). And Robert Redford, Bruce Willis,
Whoopi Goldberg and Julia Roberts haven't fared poorly with dominant
left hands.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe what we need is a new Bill of Lefts requiring sensitivity
training for right-handers to understand how left-handers cope. Maybe
right-handers should feel, well, left out for a while. Let's make
northpaws sit in left-handed school desks, use left-handed scissors,
potato peelers, ladles and ice-cream scoops. Wouldn't you think Ben
Franklin could have invented some solution? He was left-handed. But
then so was Jack the Ripper.</TE>

<LD>Re "Forget Test Scores; Teach Kids a Love of Reading," Voices, March
2: Love of books and learning to read are not mutually exclusive. In
my 20 years of teaching kindergarten in Central Los Angeles, the
children I've taught have always responded to the books I've read to
them and that have filled my classrooms.</LD>
<LD>   Until recently, I had to buy them all myself, but our school
library now has thousands of beautiful new books. Because of the
reforms that have substituted systematic reading instruction for a
curriculum based on vague theories of learning by osmosis, now my
kids can actually read their books themselves, not just pretend to,
and they love them even more.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, books and computers are not an either/or proposition.
The printing press was an invention of the 17th century, the Internet
one of the 20th century. A hundred years from now, books printed on
paper will be interesting antiques.</LD>

<TE>   "I didn't know reading could be fun!" a struggling 14-year-old boy
recently told me.</TE>
<TE>   "Find me another good book," requests a student who has just
passed her first book test and tells me that she has never read a
whole book on her own before.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to try something harder to read next time. Can you help
me?" asks an immigrant student.</TE>
<TE>   After 30 years of teaching, the last eight as a credentialed
librarian, I couldn't disagree more with Regina Powers. The reading
incentive program, Scholastic Reading Counts, has produced amazing
changes in attitudes about reading at our school.</TE>

pass computerized comprehension tests on their selections and then

<LD>Re "Community Colleges Fear Loss of Funds for Support Program," March
5: In the past, California has had enough money to provide not only
the federally required level of funding for CalWORKS recipients but
to exceed those funding levels to provide an additional variety of
programs and services. Given California's current fiscal situation,
the state can no longer afford to provide funding at levels exceeding
federal requirements.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis' proposed spending plan does not eliminate these
programs but requires counties to work with community college
districts to identify the most effective forms of outreach and
service for the CalWORKS population within existing resources. If the
county and community colleges believe the CalWORKS model is the most
effective for serving that population, they have the discretion to
allocate funds to continue its support.</LD>

<LD>Re "Young Scientist Lonely at the Top," March 6: For 60 years
California has not had the most finalists, even once, in the Science
Talent Search for outstanding high school science students (despite
having one-ninth of all Americans for many years now). But this year
is a new low: We have only one of the 40 finalists! New York
invariably leads with the most. This is no accident; New York--and
most states--have science programs superior to California's.</LD>
<LD>   Last year California came in last in the National Assessment of
Educational Progress test in science. Science teachers can, and often
do, earn much more elsewhere. About half of our California high
school physics teachers do not even have a minor in that subject.
Unless parents become aroused and demand change, nothing will
change--it hasn't for a long time.</LD>

<LD>'''Martyrs' Leading War on Israel'' (March 8), about the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade, shows the fallacy of believing in the Oslo accords.
These murderers are affiliated with Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat, who is supposed to be the peacemaker. The West trained
them and armed them, and now they are killing innocent men, women and
children. Until they are disarmed there will be no peace.</LD>
<LD>   It also shows Arafat's true colors. These are his men. So he is
either unable to control them or unwilling to control them. In either
case he is not a partner to peace, and until new Palestinian
leadership that is willing to stop this violence takes control there
will be no peace. Israel's job is to defend itself. These killers
readily admit that innocent victims are their targets. We in the U.S.
would never allow killers to just do as they wish. Why should Israel?</LD>

<TE>   Whoever was in charge of security at the Atzmona site of the
tragic massacre should be court-martialed (''Violence Escalates in
Fresh Round of Bloody Attacks,'' March 8). There is absolutely no
excuse for why security cannot be maintained and settlers protected.
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon continually blasts out that he wants to
protect Israelis. He is doing a pretty poor job. Is anyone in charge
of internal security? If security cannot be maintained then Israel
should get out of the settlements.</TE>

<TE>   Finally, Secretary of State Colin Powell has spoken against the
escalating atrocities committed by Sharon and his government
(''Powell Criticizes Israeli Strategy,'' March 7). For too long, the
blame and the responsibility to end the violence have been placed on
the oppressed--the Palestinians. But the one that truly has the power
to stop the violence is the Israeli government.</TE>

<TE>   It is not only the Saudis who face a disastrous future if the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict drags on (Commentary, March 1). Everyone
in the region, including the Israelis, is looking at a gloomy future.
By 2020 the population of the region will have doubled. Over 350
million people will live in cities that are already overcrowded and
underserved. Shortages of water, among other things, will be
regionwide events.</TE>
<TE>   Israel cannot remain insular while all this is going on. It will
not remain immune from these regional developments. There is a lot to
look forward to when there is peace based on a two-state solution to
this conflict: Israel and Palestine living side by side based on
mutual respect and coexistence. In war, Israelis will suffer and
Palestinians will suffer. In peace, both will prosper.</TE>

<LD>Neal Halfon and Peter Long decry the cutbacks in health care,
especially in the children's health insurance programs ("Society Will
Pay the Price of Cutbacks," Opinion, March 3). I deplore the cutbacks
that seriously affect those most in need. But the simple fact is that
the money just isn't there. The state is facing a large deficit and
is cutting funding to counties that administer the programs. The
counties don't have the money either.</LD>
<LD>   So what is the solution? Obviously money. But where is it going to
come from? Neither the state nor the counties can run deficits. The
federal government isn't going to be of much help either. What it
boils down to is a lose-lose situation that, however deplorable, just
happens to be a fact of life. I'd like to have a beach house, a
convertible and an SUV, but the money just isn't there for me either.
Sometimes we just have to bite the bullet and admit there are no
readily available solutions.</LD>

<LD>In the ongoing debate over school vouchers, one reason for having
vouchers goes unsaid: They can provide parents leverage in dealings
with school districts. A top-heavy district bureaucracy and go-along
school board might react differently to angry parents holding
petitions with hundreds of signatures threatening student departure.
The threat of loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars--if not
millions--might cause districts to pay heed to parents' voices.</LD>
<LD>   Actually using a voucher to remove a child from a district would
be a secondary effect. Given this, why not vote to have a voucher?</LD>

<LD>Re "Now Davis Faces His Real Challenger," by Dan Schnur, Commentary,
March 7: Wow! Gov. Gray Davis must think that a large portion of his
constituents, California's Republicans, are really stupid. He spent
$10 million on attack ads to convince us to vote for Bill Simon
instead of Richard Riordan? Gee, I thought I voted for Simon because
he is not a career politician, he will put education first, maybe he
can deal with the utility problems Davis cannot seem to grasp and
because he received the endorsement of New York's former mayor,
Rudolph Giuliani.</LD>
<LD>   Guess I was wrong. Whatever shall I do in November? Please, Gov.
Davis, tell me how to think!</LD>
<LD>   Shayne Hood</LD>
<TE>   Newhall</TE>

<TE>   What are the chances that Simon will mention his being a
conservative Republican in his advertising now?</TE>
<TE>   Michael McKinnon</TE>
<TE>   Pomona</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Running opposed by three all-but-invisible, no-name, no-budget
candidates, Davis got only 81% of the Democratic vote in the March 5
primary. Nearly one-fifth of Democrats found it too distasteful to
vote for Davis. I am not unhappy with Davis' handling of the
California energy crisis. But I am very unhappy with his past vetoes
of increases in workers' compensation and "driving while black"
tracking legislation, his dishonest maneuvers to kill limits on
unwanted telemarketing calls, his support for bringing large-scale
casino gambling to California and his massive fund-raising and
servicing of large donors and special interests.</TE>
<TE>   I cannot and will not vote for either Davis or Simon. For many
Democrats and moderate Republicans our only hope in November is a
large, organized write-in campaign. Candidates?</TE>
<TE>   David Reisner</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The conservative wing of the Republican Party has greatly reduced
the chances of kicking Davis out of office by selecting Simon as the
man to face the governor in November. Though I do not agree with all
of Riordan's ideas or proposed policies, he was the best man to
capture a great majority of dissatisfied Democrats and moderate
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Simon will alienate the moderate voters of the state. Maybe, just
maybe, the voters will be so completely disgusted with Davis that
they will vote Simon into the governor's office. However, Republicans
just made that goal much harder to reach with Simon as the only other
choice.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Zamoyski</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the language of psychobabble, the California Republicans need
an intervention. Last Tuesday they hurt themselves by nominating
Simon for governor. This attempt at political suicide is a cry for
help by a party that feels isolated and disconnected from the voters
of the state.</TE>
<TE>   The only way for the GOP to end its downward spiral is to realize
that most people dislike social conservatives almost as much as they
dislike taxes. We'll all be better off when one of the parties
realizes this and runs candidates who are fiscally conservative and
socially liberal.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Small</TE>
<TE>   Isla Vista</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even as a lifelong Democrat, I find it difficult voting for
Davis--a governor preoccupied with raising campaign cash. Now that
Republican voters have defeated the moderate Riordan in favor of a
more right-wing candidate, however, it looks like I'm stuck with
voting for Davis in November.</TE>
<TE>   Now, let's see what else is in the news: "Davis Names Former
Edison Chief to PUC," March 6. Well, on second thought, just to be
fair, maybe I should be giving this guy Simon a closer look: "A"
rating by the National Rifle Assn. . . . endorsement by the
California Pro-Life Council . . . White House and its allies . . .
reaching out to Simon" ("Simon's Conservative Image Could Play Into
Davis' Hands," March 6). Nah, I guess it'll have to be Davis after
all.</TE>

<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a senior fellow at the Johns
Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in
Washington and an adjunct professor at the U.S. Air Force School of
Advanced Airpower Studies. He is also a consultant to a number of
nongovernmental organizations and a regular contributor to the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration, in a secret policy review completed early
this year, has ordered the Pentagon to draft contingency plans for
the use of nuclear weapons against at least seven countries, naming
not only Russia and the "axis of evil"--Iraq, Iran, and North
Korea--but also China, Libya and Syria.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the U.S. Defense Department has been told to prepare
for the possibility that nuclear weapons may be required in some
future Arab-Israeli crisis. And, it is to develop plans for using
nuclear weapons to retaliate against chemical or biological attacks,
as well as "surprising military developments" of an unspecified
nature.</LD>
<LD>   These and a host of other directives, including calls for
developing bunker-busting mini-nukes and nuclear weapons that reduce
collateral damage, are contained in a still-classified document
called the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which was delivered to
Congress on Jan. 8.</LD>
<TE>   Like all such documents since the dawning of the Atomic Age more
than a half-century ago, this NPR offers a chilling glimpse into the
world of nuclear-war planners: With a Strangelovian genius, they
cover every conceivable circumstance in which a president might wish
to use nuclear weapons--planning in great detail for a war they hope
never to wage.</TE>
<TE>   In this top-secret domain, there has always been an inconsistency
between America's diplomatic objectives of reducing nuclear arsenals
and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, on
the one hand, and the military imperative to prepare for the
unthinkable, on the other.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Bush administration plan reverses an almost
two-decade-long trend of relegating nuclear weapons to the category
of weapons of last resort. It also redefines nuclear requirements in
hurried post-Sept. 11 terms.</TE>
<TE>   In these and other ways, the still-secret document offers insights
into the evolving views of nuclear strategists in Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld's Defense Department.</TE>
<TE>   While downgrading the threat from Russia and publicly emphasizing
their commitment to reducing the number of long-range nuclear
weapons, Defense Department strategists promote tactical and
so-called "adaptive" nuclear capabilities to deal with contingencies
where large nuclear arsenals are not demanded.</TE>
<TE>   They seek a host of new weapons and support systems, including
conventional military and cyber warfare capabilities integrated with
nuclear warfare. The end product is a now-familiar post-Afghanistan
model--with nuclear capability added. It combines precision weapons,
long-range strikes, and special and covert operations.</TE>
<TE>   But the NPR's call for development of new nuclear weapons that
reduce "collateral damage" myopically ignores the political, moral
and military implications--short-term and long--of crossing the
nuclear threshold.</TE>
<TE>   Under what circumstances might nuclear weapons be used under the
new posture? The NPR says they "could be employed against targets
able to withstand nonnuclear attack," or in retaliation for the use
of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, or "in the event of
surprising military developments."</TE>
<TE>   Planning nuclear-strike capabilities, it says, involves the
recognition of "immediate, potential or unexpected" contingencies.
North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Libya are named as "countries that
could be involved" in all three kinds of threat. "All have
long-standing hostility towards the United States and its security
partners. All sponsor or harbor terrorists, and have active WMD
[weapons of mass destruction] and missile programs."</TE>
<TE>   China, because of its nuclear forces and "developing strategic
objectives," is listed as "a country that could be involved in an
immediate or potential contingency." Specifically, the NPR lists a
military confrontation over the status of Taiwan as one of the
scenarios that could lead Washington to use nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Other listed scenarios for nuclear conflict are a North Korean
attack on South Korea and an Iraqi assault on Israel or its
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The second important insight the NPR offers into Pentagon thinking
about nuclear policy is the extent to which the Bush administration's
strategic planners were shaken by last September's terrorist attacks
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Though Congress directed
the new administration "to conduct a comprehensive review of U.S.
nuclear forces" before the events of Sept. 11, the final study is
striking for its single-minded reaction to those tragedies.</TE>
<TE>   Heretofore, nuclear strategy tended to exist as something apart
from the ordinary challenges of foreign policy and military affairs.
Nuclear weapons were not just the option of last resort, they were
the option reserved for times when national survival hung in the
balance--a doomsday confrontation with the Soviet Union, for
instance.</TE>
<TE>   Now, nuclear strategy seems to be viewed through the prism of
Sept. 11. For one thing, the Bush administration's faith in
old-fashioned deterrence is gone. It no longer takes a superpower to
pose a dire threat to Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "The terrorists who struck us on Sept. 11th were clearly not
deterred by doing so from the massive U.S. nuclear arsenal," Rumsfeld
told an audience at the National Defense University in late January.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, U.S. Undersecretary of State John R. Bolton said in a
recent interview, "We would do whatever is necessary to defend
America's innocent civilian population .... The idea that fine
theories of deterrence work against everybody ... has just been
disproven by Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, while insisting they would go nuclear only if other
options seemed inadequate, officials are looking for nuclear weapons
that could play a role in the kinds of challenges the United States
faces with Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Accordingly, the NPR calls for new emphasis on developing such
things as nuclear bunker-busters and surgical "warheads that reduce
collateral damage," as well as weapons that could be used against
smaller, more circumscribed targets--"possible modifications to
existing weapons to provide additional yield flexibility," in the
jargon-rich language of the review.</TE>
<TE>   It also proposes to train U.S. Special Forces operators to play
the same intelligence gathering and targeting roles for nuclear
weapons that they now play for conventional weapons strikes in
Afghanistan. And cyber-warfare and other nonnuclear military
capabilities would be integrated into nuclear-strike forces to make
them more all-encompassing.</TE>
<TE>   As for Russia, once the primary reason for having a U.S. nuclear
strategy, the review says that while Moscow's nuclear programs remain
cause for concern, "ideological sources of conflict" have been
eliminated, rendering a nuclear contingency involving Russia
"plausible" but "not expected."</TE>
<TE>   "In the event that U.S. relations with Russia significantly worsen
in the future," the review says, "the U.S. may need to revise its
nuclear force levels and posture."</TE>
<TE>   When completion of the NPR was publicly announced in January,
Pentagon briefers deflected questions about most of the specifics,
saying the information was classified. Officials did stress that,
consistent with a Bush campaign pledge, the plan called for reducing
the current 6,000 long-range nuclear weapons to one-third that number
over the next decade. Rumsfeld, who approved the review late last
year, said the administration was seeking "a new approach to
strategic deterrence," to include missile defenses and improvements
in nonnuclear capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Russia would no longer be officially defined as "an enemy."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, almost no details were revealed.</TE>
<TE>   The classified text, however, is shot through with a worldview
transformed by Sept. 11. The NPR coins the phrase "New Triad," which
it describes as comprising the "offensive strike leg," (our nuclear
and conventional forces) plus "active and passive defenses,"(our
anti-missile systems and other defenses) and "a responsive defense
infrastructure" (our ability to develop and produce nuclear weapons
and resume nuclear testing). Previously, the nuclear "triad" was the
bombers, long-range land-based missiles and submarine-launched
missiles that formed the three legs of America's strategic arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   The review emphasizes the integration of "new nonnuclear strategic
capabilities" into nuclear-war plans. "New capabilities must be
developed to defeat emerging threats such as hard and deeply-buried
targets (HDBT), to find and attack mobile and re-locatable targets,
to defeat chemical and biological agents, and to improve accuracy and
limit collateral damage," the review says.</TE>
<TE>   It calls for "a new strike system" using four converted Trident
submarines, an unmanned combat air vehicle and a new air-launched
cruise missile as potential new weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond new nuclear weapons, the review proposes establishing what
it calls an "agent defeat" program, which defense officials say
includes a "boutique" approach to finding new ways of destroying
deadly chemical or biological warfare agents, as well as penetrating
enemy facilities that are otherwise difficult to attack. This
includes, according to the document, "thermal, chemical or
radiological neutralization of chemical/biological materials in
production or storage facilities."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials stress that the development and
integration of nonnuclear capabilities into the nuclear force is what
permits reductions in traditional long-range weaponry. But the
blueprint laid down in the review would expand the breadth and
flexibility of U.S. nuclear capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the new weapons systems, the review calls for
incorporation of "nuclear capability" into many of the conventional
systems now under development. An extended-range conventional cruise
missile in the works for the U.S. Air Force "would have to be
modified to carry nuclear warheads if necessary." Similarly, the F-35
Joint Strike Fighter should be modified to carry nuclear weapons "at
an affordable price."</TE>
<TE>   The review calls for research to begin next month on fitting an
existing nuclear warhead into a new 5,000-pound "earth penetrating"
munition.</TE>
<TE>   Given the advances in electronics and information technologies in
the past decade, it is not surprising that the NPR also stresses
improved satellites and intelligence, communications, and more robust
high-bandwidth decision-making systems.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly noticeable is the directive to improve U.S.
capabilities in the field of "information operations," or
cyber-warfare. The intelligence community "lacks adequate data on
most adversary computer local area networks and other command and
control systems," the review observes. It calls for improvements in
the ability to "exploit" enemy computer networks, and the integration
of cyber-warfare into the overall nuclear war database "to enable
more effective targeting, weaponeering, and combat assessment
essential to the New Triad."</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, when Bush administration officials talked about
the implications of Sept. 11 for long-term military policy, they have
often focused on "homeland defense" and the need for an anti-missile
shield. In truth, what has evolved since last year's terror attacks
is an integrated, significantly expanded planning doctrine for
nuclear wars.</TE>

<HD>Cities Exaggerate Cost of Water Cleanup</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>To hear the city of Lakewood tell it, new regulations aimed at
controlling the county's No. 1 source of water pollution--urban
runoff--could well end up raising property taxes by nearly $1,300 per
parcel of land. Meeting the new standards, the city's Web site says,
will cost the region's cities some $53 billion, an amount, the
anonymous writer cautions, that is "four times higher than the
combined property-tax revenues collected by all the cities in Los
Angeles County each year."</LD>
<LD>   The trouble with the city's Web site proclamations--and many other
statements being made by cities and other entities trying to evade
the new mandates--is that they're simply not true. Not even close.</LD>
<LD>   Public policy debates usually involve disagreements about the
facts, and they often are politicized. But the developing battle over
urban runoff goes way beyond politics and honest disagreements. Some
50 cities--including Los Angeles--have joined forces with Los Angeles
County and the Building Industry Assn. to block a crucial effort to
clean up coastal waters off Southern California, and they're
blatantly distorting facts in the process.</LD>
<TE>   The dispute stems from a long-established mandate of the federal
Clean Water Act that requires cities to take steps to clean up the
witches' brew of toxics, pesticides, bacteria, trash and other
pollutants that accumulate on lawns and pavement. During rainstorms,
this toxic mess is flushed into storm drains, which feed directly
into rivers and flood channels and ultimately into the ocean. This
runoff is nearly always toxic to aquatic life, and it is laden with
germs that have been shown to sicken swimmers at beaches where it is
discharged. It is the most substantial source of coastal water
pollution in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   For 10 years, until state officials at the Regional Water Quality
Control Board approved a new, tougher Clean Water Act plan in
December 2001, cities were free to take half-steps without regard for
the law's bottom line: demonstrating progress in reducing pollution.
Whatever the conceptual merits or demerits of previous plans, one
truth is inescapable: The plans failed, largely because cities never
committed to measurable goals in pollution reduction.</TE>
<TE>   After a decade of efforts to coax the cities into action, the
regional water board decided last year to take more decisive steps.
New rules were passed aimed at eliminating trash on beaches and along
local waterways through a combination of increased public education
and new devices that can keep trash from ever entering the flow.
Clear standards were established for pollution reduction along all
waterways in the region. No longer would cities, responsible under
federal and state law for improving the region's water-quality
problems, be given free rein to implement plans without having to
prove that their efforts were actually improving water quality.</TE>
<TE>   While some cities simply got busy trying to comply with the new
regulations, more than 30 others, led by Signal Hill, formed an
organization that calls itself by the Orwellian name of "Coalition
for Practical Regulation." The group has filed legal appeals and
motions seeking to overturn the new plan and is threatening to sue
over efforts to reduce bacteria levels at local beaches.</TE>
<TE>   And the coalition's efforts are not limited to fighting in the
courts. Taking a cue from "court-packing" efforts in the 1930s, the
coalition is sponsoring legislation in Sacramento that would
radically reconfigure the regional water board, reconstituting it
with members sympathetic to the group's goals. The bill, introduced
last month by Assemblyman Edward Chavez (D-Industry), would dissolve
the current board and allow local governments to handpick one-third
of the new board.</TE>
<TE>   But the willingness of local bureaucrats to prevaricate about the
costs and implications of the new clean-water efforts is, ultimately,
the most shameful element of this story. Lakewood's claim that the
new plans will cost more than $50 billion, with per-parcel
assessments of $1,300, is a grotesque exaggeration, based on a
discredited 1998 study that estimated the costs of treating each drop
of runoff to standards beyond those applied to sewage--something not
required or even contemplated by the new plans.</TE>
<TE>   Cleaning up the region's biggest source of water pollution and
protecting public health will certainly not be cost free. And
estimating those costs is, at best, approximate. But cities in South
Orange County have estimated that a similar cleanup plan there,
albeit for a smaller area, will add $15 million a year to its current
water-quality expenditures of $7 million, a far cry from the tens of
billions bandied about by Lakewood. And even the Orange County number
is inflated by the fact that it incorporates programs like street
sweeping, which serve purposes other than water-quality improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Cities have also contended that under the new regulations they
will face ceaseless and frivolous rounds of lawsuits from
environmental groups determined to enforce the letter of the law. In
fact, similar runoff-pollution prevention requirements have been in
place for two to three years in Long Beach and in the cities of
Ventura County without provoking lawsuits. The recalcitrance of
cities not even attempting compliance is far likelier to provoke
litigation as environmental organizations grow increasingly
exasperated. Southern Californians, polls show, highly value clean
water, and large numbers of them are simply fed-up with the
do-nothing bureaucratic gang that has hijacked clean-water policy at
the local government level.</TE>
<TE>   Debates are based on disagreements, but disagreements need not and
should not be propelled by blatant misinformation. Making matters
worse is that local residents, who largely fund city coffers, are
unwittingly paying the bill for legal and lobbying campaigns designed
to overturn policies designed to protect them. The public deserves
far better. So, too, does the coastal environment that animates the
Southern California lifestyle and propels a tourist and recreational
economy worth far more than the real costs associated with
maintaining it. Its time for Mayor James K. Hahn, the City Council
and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to call off their
appeals and rein in city officials who are attacking clean water in
Southern California. If these regional policymakers actually show
environmental leadership, they can play an instrumental role in
setting a more constructive course toward clean water.</TE>

<HD>The Face of Botox Economics</HD>

<AU>NEAL GABLER</AU>
<BD>Neal Gabler, a senior fellow at the Norman Lear Center
at USC Annenberg, is the author of "Life the Movie: How Entertainment
Conquered Reality."</BD>
<DL>AMAGANSETT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>As its former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling has been recently telling it,
bankrupt Enron was not mismanaged. Rather, it was the victim of a
"run on the bank" when Enron's lenders panicked and called in their
loans. This is a highly creative analysis of the situation, but, in a
way, Skilling may be right. What most of us economic laymen know
about Enron is that a crafty cadre of top executives signed off on
partnerships designed to shift risk and eventual debt from Enron's
balance sheet to that of the partnerships, where it could be hidden
from the company's lenders and investors. Although Skilling wouldn't
exactly put it this way, he seems to be saying that if only Enron's
lenders hadn't learned about the company's mounting debt, or if they
hadn't cared, everything would still be all right, and Enron would be
flying high.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the ridicule he has endured, what Skilling and his fellow
Enron conspirators are articulating is a new and, it turns out,
widely practiced economic theory--one that has less to do with
finance than with a larger cultural phenomenon. Call their theory
"Botox economics," after the faddish treatment for wrinkles, because,
like that treatment, it is predicated on the idea that the only thing
that really matters in America is how something looks. In Botox
therapy, muscle tissue is injected with a form of botulinum toxin
that paralyzes the surrounding tissues, weakening facial muscles and
thus temporarily eradicating wrinkles. The only hitch is that one may
also lose a degree of facial control--the little crinkle of the eye,
the turn of the lip, the furrow of the brow--that enables us to
express emotion. Personality is sacrificed for appearance.</TE>
<TE>   In the same way, Botox economics eradicates some of the nastier
financial wrinkles by presenting a neat set of books, but the
appearance comes at the expense of substance.</TE>
<TE>   In arriving at their theory, what Skilling, his predecessor
Kenneth L. Lay, Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow and the rest
of the Enron gang discovered--and they certainly weren't the
first--is that business is no different from anything else in modern
American life. Perception is everything. The Enron boys had only to
look around them to see a nation obsessed with image--in the clothes
one wore, the car one drove, the neighborhood one lived in, the
schools one's children attended, the books one read, and, yes, the
Botox one injected into one's face. Everyone was performing for
everyone else. Or, in historian Daniel Boorstin's words, Americans
had learned to live within their illusions. Enron simply adapted this
cultural phenomenon to business. The trick wasn't making a sound
company, which was a difficult thing to do and which depended on too
many variables. The trick was making a company that seemed to be
sound, which was much easier and much more American.</TE>
<TE>   In traditional economics, investors and analysts examined a
company's fundamentals in determining whether the company was sound.
They wanted good management and a vigilant board of directors. They
wanted a far-sighted business strategy. They wanted a healthy, which
is to say a sensible, price-to-earnings ratio. (For the record, at
its height in mid-2000, Enron sold at 267 times its pretended
earnings.) Or in everyday language, they wanted a well-run company
producing goods or services for which there seemed to be a growing
market.</TE>
<TE>   That's a standard not easy to meet, which is where Botox economics
comes in. Botox economics isn't concerned with fundamentals or
price-to-earning ratios or good management or visionary strategies or
any of the other hallmarks of sound business practice. It is
concerned with appearances. Enron prided itself on being an energy
company without actual oil or gas or electricity assets; it simply
brokered energy between suppliers and those in need. (In contrast,
Dynegy, a rival energy company that was negotiating to merge with
Enron late last year, is now running ads proclaiming that it has
"real assets.")</TE>
<TE>   But in fact, Enron did produce something--illusions. The main
illusion was that Enron was a booming company on the cutting edge of
the economy. To sustain that, it not only jiggered its books, but it
engaged in more pedestrian forms of image-mongering. It threw lavish
parties with Tiffany glassware as door prizes. It contributed mammoth
amounts of money to charity and politics and had friends in high
places. It provided Starbucks coffee for its employees and Cristal
champagne for its executives at lunch. In 2000, it even bought the
rights to put its name on the new stadium of the Houston Astros,
which the baseball team has since paid Enron to remove.</TE>
<TE>   But just how insubstantial it all was was revealed in a story
first reported by Dow Jones Newswires. To impress a group of visiting
Wall Street stock analysts, Enron executives once ordered about 75
employees, including secretaries, throughout its headquarters to come
down to the trading floor to man phones and pretend they were making
deals. It was a scene right out of "The Sting"--and it worked. The
analysts left believing Enron couldn't make deals fast enough.</TE>
<TE>   While it may be comforting to think of Enron as an aberration, in
this respect at least the company's publicity may have been right.
Enron was in the business vanguard. The economic boom of the 1990s
was fueled by many factors--among them, increased productivity,
expanding technology, growing markets, weakened unions and
consolidation. But it was also a product of hype and show and
illusion, which is why stock prices could soar whether companies'
fundamentals supported the rises or not.</TE>
<TE>   Companies like Enron pretended to be booming, and gullible
investors, caught up in the mania of fast money and the rush of
investment itself, were entranced. Increasingly, investors weren't
betting on the success of a company in traditional terms like how
many goods it was selling or how much money it was making; they were
betting on the success of its stock price, and that was often more a
function of the company's image than of its balance sheet or, as
Enron demonstrated, a function of the image of its balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing new in companies' burnishing their images. What
is new is that this wasn't an adjunct to their main business. For
many, this was their business. Enron purveyed its images, and
investors stayed within the bubble of these images, giddily bidding
up its stock price, which kept going up because it became
disconnected from anything but image.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't economics, either. This was a form of entertainment
that demanded that investors, like the audience of any movie or TV
show, suspend their disbelief. And it wasn't just ordinary folks who
fell victim. Some of the country's largest banks, like Citigroup,
poured money into Enron. Virtually the entire tech boom was a
testament to investors' bedazzlement by the illusion of being in the
vanguard even when there were no profits to show for it and none in
the offing. In the end, then, it wasn't just Botox economics.
Image-obsessed America had created a whole Botox economy, of which
Enron was a symptom.</TE>
<TE>   The one check on this hoodoo might have been the financial press,
but it had been co-opted by Botox economics, too. Financial
journalists used to pride themselves on analyzing which companies
were poised to soar and which to fall, based on traditional
bellwethers. It wasn't glamorous or exciting work, but it was
functional.</TE>
<TE>   With the rise of cable television and the transformation of
investment from analysis to recreation, that changed. Financial
journalists seemed less interested in digging beneath a company's
image than in polishing it as a way of enhancing the thrill of
investment entertainment. In Enron's case, Skilling appeared as a
cover boy on business magazines, which gave him the same gushy
encomiums that entertainment reporters lavish on stars. When one
intrepid Fortune magazine reporter did begin doing some old-fashioned
spadework on Enron, Skilling lacerated her for being a party pooper.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of providing that kind of investigation, all day long the
business cable network CNBC carts out analysts and executives to tout
stocks and provide a rosy picture of the market, so much so that some
astute investors apparently are now getting an advance roster of
guests and then buying the stocks of their companies on the theory
that the executives, naturally, will always praise their business. In
a Botox economy, that is enough to make the stock price rise.</TE>
<TE>   If all this sounds more like Hollywood than Wall Street, it is.
The two have been converging for years, with the latter, like so much
else in America, modeling itself after the former. What Enron
demonstrates is just how far the transformation had gone, and how
much everyone had bought into it. In effect, the company and the
economy had become an elaborate show, a blockbuster movie, engineered
to entertain investors and enrich executives by doing precisely what
entertainment has always done: provide the illusion of happiness.
That the happiness didn't last can be attributed not to the fact that
it was all air but, rather, as Skilling has been telling us, to our
sudden unwillingness to suspend our disbelief in the face of the
flood of red ink that the company was no longer able to conceal.
Living by the image, Enron ultimately died by the shattering of that
image. Or in Botox terms, the wrinkles finally began to show.</TE>

Gottlieb is the director of the institute.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High school bands played. Proceedings were broadcast live on radio.
Participants feasted at a VIP buffet. All this to celebrate the
January 1994 opening of a Vons market in the Compton Renaissance
Plaza, the first full-service supermarket to be built in the inner
city after the 1992 riots.</LD>
<LD>   Danny Bakewell, whose Compton Commercial Development Corp. was the
project developer, said, "People give rhetoric to wanting to help
inner cities--this is the way to do it.</LD>
<LD>   But just six years later, Vons quietly closed the doors of its
ballyhooed Compton store, citing its lack of profitability. The
promise of a supermarket-led economic boom, like so many other
promises made to neighborhoods affected by the riots, had been
broken.</LD>
<TE>   In July 1992, representatives of Vons and Rebuild L.A. held a
press conference to announce the company's plans to build stores in
riot zones. Vons promised to build no fewer than 12 markets in the
inner city. Rebuild L.A. chairman Peter V. Ueberroth proclaimed that
the action "provided a Good Housekeeping seal of approval to all
those corporations throughout America who wonder: 'Should we really
invest in the inner city?'" Vons "stepped up," said Ueberroth. It's
the "bell cow."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, Ralphs, Smart &amp; Final and Food 4 Less made similar
announcements. All told, the four food-market chains vowed to build
more than 30 new supermarkets in the inner city, and other
supermarket companies were also expected to increase their
investments in such neighborhoods. "Over a long period of time," said
Vons chairman Roger Strangeland, "we simply lost sight of the
[profit-making] opportunity that existed in the neglected areas--and
shame on us for being so late to rediscover the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Rebuild L.A.'s campaign to build supermarkets in the inner city
made sound economic sense. The stores would be a major source of new
employment, creating between 1,000 to 2,000 jobs, with some paying
above the minimum wage. During the previous 30 years, supermarkets
had significantly abandoned the inner city for suburban locations. A
UCLA study done in 1993 quantified the exodus: The number of
inner-city chain markets had declined by nearly half.</TE>
<TE>   Inner-city residents' lack of access to fresh and affordable food
was another concern. A 1995 survey done by RLA, Rebuild L.A.'s new
coinage, asked 1,100 residents living in a 52-square-mile area
affected by the civil unrest what goods and services their community
lacked. Quality grocery stores and supermarkets were their
overwhelming response. Economically, this represented enormous unmet
demand. In the riot-affected areas, a supermarket typically served
16,571 people, compared with 7,795 people in greater Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   So, what happened? Of the 12 stores promised by Vons, six were
built. One was a rebuild of a store damaged in the riots. A second
was located in an area of Pomona that did not meet RLA's definition
of neglected areas--those with poverty rates of 20% or higher. Two of
the new stores have since closed, including the one in Compton.</TE>
<TE>   But it's unfair to single out Vons. In evaluating the 10-year
period since the civil unrest, the Urban &amp; Environmental Policy
Institute (UEPI) at Occidental College inventoried chain and
independent markets in the RLA survey area. In 1992, there were 32
chain supermarkets and 23 independents. Today, there are 31 chain
supermarkets and 26 independents. The change, such as it is, is
marginal, at best. The ratio of stores owned by the four major chains
to population is even more striking: one supermarket for every 42,000
people in the area, compared with one supermarket for every 24,000 in
L.A. County as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the lack of progress is consolidation in the
supermarket industry. After Ralphs merged with Food 4 Less in 1995,
55 stores were either eliminated or merged with other ones, resulting
in a loss of 1,000 higher-paying union jobs, including some in the
inner city. The replacement stores--independent or other retail--were
largely nonunion, which could mean as much as a $162-a-week pay cut,
loss of benefits and little, if any, job security.</TE>
<TE>   Access to fresh and affordable food in the inner city is not much
better, either. The rapid spread of fast food, with its high fat and
salt content, in the inner city has compounded the problem. One
recent survey, by the South Los Angeles Community Coalition, of a
two-square-mile area in South-Central found 52 fast-food
establishments and only one sit-down restaurant. The one chain
supermarket in the area offered a far poorer quality of meats and
produce compared with an equivalent chain market in a middle-class
neighborhood. The health and nutritional consequences of this
development are clear.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few success stories, however. A couple of supermarkets
have been built in joint ventures with community organizations, with
government facilitating the permitting process and waiving various
rules. A handful of independent inner-city markets have adopted
innovative programs, like van shuttles, to serve their
transit-dependent customers. And some inner-city neighborhood and
community-development organizations have taken up the cause of fresh
and affordable food for inner-city residents, sponsoring farmers'
markets, community gardens or food enterprises like the Mercado La
Paloma.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most important lesson to be gleaned from our recent
experience of building supermarkets in the inner city is that
private-sector investment isn't enough to solve the problems of too
few supermarkets and lack of access to fresh food. We also need to
see these problems as community-development and public-policy issues.
The successful stores not only involve the private sector, but also
government and the community. As important, if stores in Compton or
in other low-income neighborhoods are to survive and even flourish,
they need to reach out to the community they want to serve.</TE>

<BD>Marc B. Haefele is a reporter for the LA Weekly.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It should have been so easy. The Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors wanted to send its message of condolence to relatives of
a former colleague, Baxter Ward. Ward, swept from his 5th
Supervisorial District seat by conservative Mike Antonovich in 1980's
Reagan revolution, was famous for his politically premature devotion
to rail transit and his otherwise cantankerous ways. One of the most
colorful and memorable, if not exactly the most likable, men ever to
sit on the board in its 150-year history, Ward made a lot of news in
his day.</LD>
<LD>   He had, presumably, been collecting county benefits until his
death. Despite all this, the supervisors and board staff could find
nowhere among the county's files a record of his home address.</LD>
<LD>   That raises an embarrassing question: If the top officials of the
nation's most populous county can't find the address of one of their
own former colleagues, what does that say about the accessibility of
the rest of L.A. County's history?</LD>
<TE>   The county had already come under heavy criticism for what many
scholars consider its Orwellian institutional memory hole.
Particularly when it comes to maintaining documents that constitute
our community's factual recall.</TE>
<TE>   "It simply hasn't done a good job of keeping historical records,"
says Roy Ritchie, director of research at the Huntington Library,
perhaps Southern California's premiere archives. At a symposium at
the library last November, entitled the "Future of Los Angeles
History," many local historians seconded Ritchie's complaint. Noting
that the city of Los Angeles has an archivist, they singled out
local--particularly county--government's negligent record-keeping as
a major stumbling block in the historian's primary task of "finding
out what really happened."</TE>
<TE>   In his keynote paper, George Sanchez, a USC professor of history
and American studies, noted that "with a population greater than 42
states in the nation, and an annual budget of $16.2 billion, it is
scandalous that L.A. County has no archives and no countywide
archivist. Beginning researchers currently find out about the
presence of documents through folklore passed on by more senior
researchers, then have to negotiate ... to find [their] whereabouts."
Once the documents are found, Sanchez complained, it's often
difficult for researchers to get access or find a place on the
premises to work.</TE>
<TE>   Other historians offered their own archival tales of terror. One
even recalled that, when she attempted to return county records she'd
checked out, the agency's clerk told her she could keep them since
they weren't needed any more.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, space requirements and perpetually strained finances
are part of the problem. But the problem with county records seems
cultural, too. No single standard of preservation exists, and there
appears to be little institutional sensitivity to old documents'
value.</TE>
<TE>   David E. Janssen, L.A. County's chief administrative officer, was
skeptical that money for a county archivist could be found in this
year's budget. "For the first time in four years, the county is
facing a general-fund deficit of $60 million," says Janssen. That
means county officials are already looking at cuts in welfare,
library, parks and mental-health services.</TE>
<TE>   County records accrue the minutiae of our lives--birth, deaths and
sickness; deeds, taxes and lawsuits; land boundaries, crimes and
punishment. There are 37 county departments, including the big ones:
the superior courts, assessor's office, county registrar-recorder and
Health Services Department. Each has its own procedures for record
retention and disposal. There is no central agency responsible for
all the millions of records.</TE>
<TE>   County officials acknowledge that the situation worsened in the
1980s, when powerful and controversial Chief Administrative Officer
Richard T. Dixon exiled crucial agencies like the
registrar-recorder's office from downtown to Norwalk and other
far-flung locales. According to Ritchie, few departments meet more
than the minimum legal requirements to hold records for a certain
period of time.</TE>
<TE>   "At one point," he recalls, "they were ready to sacrifice all the
county court records up to the 1890s. They were loaded on a skid,
ready to be dumped" when the Huntington intervened to save them,
Ritchie added. Other historians and officials have noted that
countless old land maps, deed transfers, criminal and
public-employment records--even records of changes in county
government procedures--have vanished or been depleted.</TE>
<TE>   Records such as these are crucial, many historians feel, to the
understanding of the city's tumultuous first half-century, in which
Los Angeles exploded from a village to a town to a city. All with the
concomitant exploitation, expropriation and even attempted
extermination of various minority populations, as well as the
stakeholders' subsequent attempts to submerge these ugly facts into a
fictional harmonious past.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are losing are the statistics of life," Ritchie says. And
where those statistics belong is in one of the most vibrant and
growing fields of local history in America--that of Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   The very term "Los Angeles history" was long considered an
oxymoron by Clio's more staid devotees. Now, however, it's attracted
a growing batch of smart youngsters and not-so-youngsters who see the
Southland prototype as a mode for, if not the forerunner of, patterns
of social development elsewhere in America and all over the world.</TE>
<TE>   "But historians remain tied to a very traditional research
method," notes William Deverell, an associate professor of history at
Caltech who is on the board of the California Council for the
Humanities. "If we don't have the sources from the past, we cannot
reconstruct it or interpret it. And if we can't do that, we've lost
the opportunity to draw knowledge, lessons and connections with our
past."</TE>
<TE>   New York City, which has slightly less population than L.A.
County, is contrastingly rich in archival institutions. At about the
same time that this county launched its record diaspora, New York
moved many of its own scattered older records to a central site, the
old downtown Surrogate's Court.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Public Library and venerable private institutions
such as the New York Historical Society and Brooklyn's Long Island
Rail Road Historical Society also record, accumulate and make
available the minutiae of the nation's greatest city. This county,
obviously, has no comparable resources. Maybe, some speculate, that's
because our region hasn't yet reached the critical mass of
self-awareness, a sense that we all share a past, that the past has a
record, and the record helps define who we are.</TE>
<TE>   Not just, as Deverell notes, for the sake of scholars: "There's a
community, a big one, inside the jurisdictional entity known as the
County of Los Angeles, and these [10 million] people deserve to have
their community, their history and their lives taken much more
seriously."</TE>

<HD>Brand USA</HD>
<DH>America's attempt to market itself abroad using advertising
principles is destined to fail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NAOMI KLEIN</AU>
<BD>Naomi Klein is the author of "No Logo: Taking Aim at
the Brand Bullies."</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>When the White House decided it was time to address the rising tides
of anti-Americanism around the world, it didn't look to a career
diplomat for help. Instead, in keeping with the Bush administration's
philosophy that anything the public sector can do the private sector
can do better, it hired one of Madison Avenue's top brand managers.</LD>
<LD>   As undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public
affairs, Charlotte Beers' assignment was not to improve relations
with other countries but rather to perform an overhaul of the U.S.
image abroad. Beers had no previous State Department experience, but
she had held the top job at both the J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp;
Mather ad agencies, and she's built brands for everything from dog
food to power drills.</LD>
<LD>   Now she was being asked to work her magic on the greatest branding
challenge of all: to sell the United States and its war on terrorism
to an increasingly hostile world. The appointment of an ad woman to
this post understandably raised some criticism, but Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell shrugged it off. "There is nothing wrong with
getting somebody who knows how to sell something. We are selling a
product. We need someone who can re-brand American foreign policy,
re-brand diplomacy." Besides, he said, "She got me to buy Uncle Ben's
rice."</LD>
<TE>   So why, only five months in, does the campaign for a new and
improved Brand USA seem in disarray? Several of its public service
announcements have been exposed for playing fast and loose with the
facts. And when Beers went on a mission to Egypt in January to
improve the image of the U.S. among Arab "opinion-makers," it didn't
go well. Muhammad Abdel Hadi, an editor at the newspaper Al Ahram,
left his meeting with Beers frustrated that she seemed more
interested in talking about vague American values than about specific
U.S. policies. "No matter how hard you try to make them understand,"
he said, "they don't."</TE>
<TE>   The misunderstanding likely stemmed from the fact that Beers views
the United States' tattered international image as little more than a
communications problem. Somehow, despite all the global culture
pouring out of New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta, despite the fact
that you can watch CNN in Cairo and Black Hawk Down in Mogadishu,
America still hasn't managed, in Beers' words, to "get out there and
tell our story." In fact, the problem is just the opposite: America's
marketing of itself has been too effective. Schoolchildren can recite
its claims to democracy, liberty and equal opportunity as readily as
they can associate McDonald's with family fun and Nike with athletic
prowess. And they expect the U.S. to live up to its promises.</TE>
<TE>   If they are angry, as millions clearly are, it's because they have
seen those promises betrayed by U.S. policy. Despite President Bush's
insistence that America's enemies resent its liberties, most critics
of the U.S. don't actually object to America's stated values.
Instead, they point to U.S. unilateralism in the face of
international laws, widening wealth disparities, crackdowns on
immigrants and human rights violations--most recently in Guantanamo
Bay. The anger comes not only from the facts of each case but also
from a clear perception of false advertising. In other words,
America's problem is not with its brand--which could scarcely be
stronger--but with its product.</TE>
<TE>   There is another, more profound obstacle facing the relaunch of
Brand USA, and it has to do with the nature of branding itself.
Successful branding, Allen Rosenshine, chairman and CEO of BBDO
Worldwide, recently wrote in Advertising Age, "requires a carefully
crafted message delivered with consistency and discipline." Quite
true. But the values Beers is charged with selling are democracy and
diversity, values that are profoundly incompatible with this
"consistency and discipline." Add to this the fact that many of
America's staunchest critics already feel bullied into conformity by
the U.S. government (bristling at phrases like "rogue state"), and
America's branding campaign could well backfire, and backfire badly.</TE>
<TE>   In the corporate world, once a "brand identity" is settled upon by
the head office, it is enforced with military precision throughout a
company's operations. The brand identity may be tailored to
accommodate local language and cultural preferences (like McDonald's
serving pasta in Italy), but its core features--aesthetic, message,
logo--remain unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   This consistency is what brand managers like to call "the promise"
of a brand: It's a pledge that wherever you go in the world, your
experience at Wal-Mart, Holiday Inn or a Disney theme park will be
comfortable and familiar. Anything that threatens this homogeneity
dilutes a company's overall strength. That's why the flip side of
enthusiastically flogging a brand is aggressively prosecuting anyone
who tries to mess with it, whether by pirating its trademarks or by
spreading unwanted information about the brand on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   At its core, branding is about rigorously controlled one-way
messages, sent out in their glossiest form, then hermetically sealed
off from those who would turn that corporate monologue into a social
dialogue. The most important tools in launching a strong brand may be
research, creativity and design, but after that, libel and copyright
laws are a brand's best friends.</TE>
<TE>   When brand managers transfer their skills from the corporate to
the political world, they invariably bring this fanaticism for
homogeneity with them. For instance, when Wally Olins, co-founder of
the Wolff Olins brand consultancy, was asked for his take on
America's image problem, he complained that people don't have a
single clear idea about what the country stands for, but rather have
dozens if not hundreds of ideas that "are mixed up in people's heads
in a most extraordinary way. So you will often find people both
admiring and abusing America, even in the same sentence."</TE>
<TE>   From a branding perspective, it would certainly be tiresome if we
found ourselves simultaneously admiring and abusing our laundry
detergent. But when it comes to our relationship with governments,
particularly the government of the most powerful and richest nation
in the world, surely some complexity is in order. Having conflicting
views about the U.S.--admiring its creativity, for instance, but
resenting its double standards--doesn't mean you are "mixed up," to
use Mr Olins' phrase, it means you have been paying attention.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, much of the anger directed at the U.S. stems from a
belief--voiced as readily in Argentina as in France, in India as in
Saudi Arabia--that the U.S. already demands far too much "consistency
and discipline" from other nations; that beneath its stated
commitment to democracy and sovereignty, it is deeply intolerant of
deviations from the economic model known as the "the Washington
Consensus." Whether these policies, so beneficial to foreign
investors, are enforced by the Washington-based International
Monetary Fund or through international trade agreements, the U.S.'s
critics generally feel that the world is already far too influenced
by America's brand of governance (not to mention America's brands).</TE>
<TE>   There is another reason to be wary of mixing the logic of branding
with the practice of governance. When companies try to implement
global image consistency, they look like generic franchises. But when
governments do the same, they can look distinctly authoritarian. It's
no coincidence that the political leaders most preoccupied with
branding themselves and their parties were also allergic to democracy
and diversity. Think Mao Tse-tung's giant murals and red books, and
yes, think Adolf Hitler, a man utterly obsessed with purity of image:
within his party, his country, his race. Historically, this has been
the ugly flip side of politicians striving for consistency of brand:
centralized information, state controlled media, reeducation camps,
purging of dissidents and much worse.</TE>
<TE>   Democracy, thankfully, has other ideas. Unlike strong brands,
which are predictable and disciplined, democracy is messy and
fractious, if not outright rebellious. Beers and her colleagues may
have convinced Colin Powell to buy Uncle Ben's by creating a
comforting brand image, but the United States is not made up of
identical grains of rice or assembly-line hamburgers or Gap khakis.</TE>
<TE>   Its strongest "brand attribute," to use a term from Beers' world,
is its embrace of diversity, a value Beers is now, ironically,
attempting to stamp with cookie-cutter uniformity around the world.
The task is not only futile but dangerous: brand consistency and true
human diversity are antithetical--one seeks sameness, the other
celebrates difference; one fears all unscripted messages, the other
embraces debate and dissent.</TE>
<TE>   Making his pitch for Brand USA in Beijing recently, President Bush
argued that "in a free society, diversity is not disorder. Debate is
not strife." The audience applauded politely. The message may have
proved more persuasive if those values were better reflected in the
Bush administration's communications with the outside world, both in
its image and, more importantly, in its policies.</TE>
<TE>   Because as President Bush rightly points out, diversity and debate
are the lifeblood of liberty. And they are enemies of branding.</TE>

<HD>Conservative Jewish Groups Have Clout</HD>

<AU>MICHAEL MASSING</AU>
<BD>Michael Massing is a New York-based writer.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The delayed reaction of the Bush administration to the peace
initiative floated by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah has left many
perplexed. With violence in the Middle East escalating daily,
officials in Europe and the Arab world had beseeched Washington to
intervene. The Saudi idea, which offers Israel normalized relations
with the Arab world in return for a pullback to its 1967 borders,
strikes many as at least a good starting point for discussion. Yet,
the White House, while applauding the Saudi interest, was slow to
take concrete action, waiting until Friday to send its special envoy,
retired U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, back to the region.
Various explanations for this have been advanced. The Saudi ideas
were not a genuine proposal. The White House did not want to push the
Israelis and Palestinians beyond the point they themselves wanted to
go. Fighting terrorism remains the administration's top priority, and
the Israelis are a valuable ally in that fight.</LD>
<TE>   But there's another factor that has not received much attention:
the disproportionate influence in Washington of a small number of
quite conservative groups within the American Jewish community. There
are dozens of Jewish groups in the U.S. directly concerned with
Israel, and their views span the spectrum. But, in the end, only two
really matter: the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations, based in New York, and the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee (AIPAC), based in Washington. Both groups have
considerable clout with the Bush administration and have used it to
push a policy toward Israel that is well to the right of the American
Jewish mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   According to public-opinion polls, most American Jews support an
active U.S. role in promoting peace in the Middle East. Surveys taken
in the late 1990s showed that more than 80% of American Jews wanted
the United States to apply pressure to both sides to help reach a
settlement. In recent months, as Israeli citizens have come under
attack, Jews in this country have grown more conservative on the
issue, but even so, an October 2001 survey, sponsored in part by New
York's The Jewish Week, found that 85% of American Jews believe it is
important for the United States to become more involved in ending the
violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Still, Jews with more
hawkish views on Israel tend to be more politically active on the
Mideast, and it is they who control the two groups with the most
impact on U.S. foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations has a staff of only six and a budget of less than a
million dollars, but it has an impressive board made up of the heads
of 51 Jewish organizations. Among the largest are the Union of
American Hebrew Organizations, which represents America's estimated
1.5 million Reform Jews, and the United Synagogue of Conservative
Judaism, which represents America's estimated 1.5 million
Conservative Jews. Both are traditionally liberal and supportive of
actively pursuing peace in the Middle East, but they are outnumbered
by the many smaller conservative groups on the conference's board,
and since each group gets one vote regardless of size, the influence
of the larger, more liberal groups is easily neutralized.</TE>
<TE>   It is a situation that suits the organization's executive vice
chairman, Malcolm Hoenlein. A dynamic and tireless activist who made
his name working on behalf of Soviet Jewry, Hoenlein has very strong
views on Israel. In conversation, he asserts the absolute right of
Jews to settle the West Bank--or "Judea and Samaria" as he prefers to
call the area, harking back to biblical names. For several years in
the mid-1990s, Hoenlein served as an associate chairman for the
annual fund-raising dinners held in New York for Bet El, a militant
West Bank settlement that actively worked to scuttle the peace
process with the Palestinians. As head of the Conference of
Presidents, Hoenlein has developed ready access to the U.S. State
Department, Defense Department and National Security Council, and he
has used it to encourage the U.S. government to give unequivocal
support to the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon while
shunning Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   While Hoenlein concentrates on the executive branch, the American
Israel Public Affairs Committee focuses on Congress. Long regarded as
one of the most effective foreign-policy lobbies in Washington, AIPAC
has an annual budget of $19.5 million, a staff of 130, and some
60,000 members. From its office near Capitol Hill, it researches
issues, tracks legislation and lobbies Congress. Most of all, it
gives money--lots of it. Between 1997 and 2001, the 46 members on
AIPAC's board together gave political candidates and parties well in
excess of $3 million, or an average of more than $70,000 apiece. Many
of its members give money as well. Much of this money is distributed
through a network of pro-Israel political action committees.
Recipients include many key members of Congress on both sides of the
aisle, from Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer, Charles E. Schumer and
Paul Wellstone to GOP Sens. Christopher S. Bond, J. Dennis Hastert
and Trent Lott. It is not surprising, then, that Congress tends to go
along with whatever AIPAC wants.</TE>
<TE>   What AIPAC wants, meanwhile, is determined by its wealthy and
powerful board of directors, which is united in its commitment to a
strong Israel and to securing unwavering U.S. support for it. Since
Sharon became prime minister, AIPAC has steadfastly backed him. With
the United States coming under strong international pressure to rein
in both Israelis and Palestinians, AIPAC has pressed the Bush
administration to crack down on Arafat--and leave Sharon alone. Thus,
last fall, when U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was preparing
a new peace initiative with Zinni serving as a special envoy, AIPAC
sent a memo to its members in the field, urging them to meet with
their congressional representatives and press them to keep the
administration off Israel's back. The memo, notes a former AIPAC
official, was part of "an aggressive campaign to get AIPAC members to
call on their congressmen to put pressure on the administration not
to send Zinni to the region. Their emphasis was clearly to try to
minimize any effort by the administration to say Israel must exercise
restraint."</TE>
<TE>   That effort has largely succeeded. Although Powell has recently
been more critical of Israel, noting that "Prime Minister Sharon has
to take a hard look at his policies and see whether they will work,"
the White House still puts the bulk of the responsibility for ending
the violence on Arafat, something both the Israeli government and the
leaders of AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents have pushed for.</TE>
<TE>   While neither group has yet taken a position on the Saudi peace
proposal, Abraham Foxman, the national director of the
Anti-Defamation League, which works closely with both groups, told
The Jewish Week that Crown Prince Abdullah's statement was "mostly a
rehash of the old stuff. We're not even sure he's going to publicly
offer it." This is not the statement of a man truly interested in
peace.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, the United States has clear strategic and
ideological reasons for supporting Israel and would no doubt do so
regardless of any pressure from the organized Jewish community. The
fact that Israel is the sole democracy in the region further cements
its ties to this country. What's more, the power of the Jewish
"lobby" has often been exaggerated, especially in the Arab world.
Nonetheless, the Bush administration's inactivity at such a critical
moment cannot be understood without taking into account the influence
of AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents. In seeking to shield
Israel from American pressure, these groups are making an epic
miscalculation, one that in the end can only prove costly to Israel's
own interests, in terms of both its security at home and its image
abroad.</TE>

<HD>Simon's Best Hope: Be a New Riordan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY QUINN</AU>
<BD>Tony Quinn is co-editor of the California Target Book,
a nonpartisan analysis of state congressional and legislative
campaigns.</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The man who made the biggest difference in last week's primary was
not Gov. Gray Davis, Bill Simon Jr. or even Richard Riordan. It was
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Two years ago, Scalia
wrote the majority opinion declaring California's blanket-primary law
unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   In a blanket contest, any voter can vote for any candidate. Thus,
the primary electorate for the GOP race for governor would have been
100% of the voters. But after Scalia and company ditched the blanket
primary, that electorate shrunk to the 35% who are registered
Republicans and the few independents who chose to vote in the GOP
primary. Put another way, Scalia's opinion changed the electorate
from the 4 million-plus people who voted last Tuesday to about 2
million registered Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   That fundamentally changed the dynamics of the election and, as
much as anything else, dictated its outcome. Among the many mistakes
the Riordan campaign for governor made was its failure to appreciate
its shrinking universe. Riordan ran a campaign aimed at all voters;
the victorious Simon campaign was keyed to voters who were going to
vote in the GOP primary.</LD>
<TE>   The Davis campaign also understood the changed circumstances.
Davis ran well in the 1998 blanket primary, when he won the
Democratic nod, and had strongly supported the reform because it
meant more choice and a more engaged electorate. But when the court
forced California back into a closed primary, the Davis campaign saw
an opening to shape the nominee it wanted.</TE>
<TE>   The blanket primary, in theory, pushes major-party candidates
toward the center, giving Republican moderates a better opportunity
to nominate a less conservative candidate for the general election. A
closed primary, on the other hand, enables conservative Republicans
to elect one of their own, but a candidate potentially less
competitive in the general. Numerous polls buttress this view. For
example, support among the general population for abortion rights far
exceeds that among Republicans. Ditto for gun control.</TE>
<TE>   This theory will be tested in the upcoming general election,
because Davis got the opponent he wanted--the one most strongly
supported by Republican conservatives. The heart of the problem faced
by Simon is that 35% support doesn't win general elections.</TE>
<TE>   From the gubernatorial election of Ronald Reagan in 1966 through
Pete Wilson's victory in 1990, Republicans won all but two statewide
races for governor and every statewide vote for president. That's
because the 35% Republican base--it has changed little over the
years--could be combined with about 15% of the electorate that was
nominally Democratic but quite conservative, the Reagan Democrats as
they were known.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, however, Reagan Democrats disappeared. Although
Democratic registration in the state fell--at 44.98% of voters, the
lowest since 1934--Democratic-voting loyalty rose. Even more
important, new voters tend to favor Democratic candidates even if not
party members. Twenty years ago, 53% of the state's electorate
registered Democratic, 9% independent. But that 53% split their vote,
and the independents did not really count.</TE>
<TE>   Today, one of every five voters is independent or belongs to a
minor party. They are the new swing vote. In the 2000 presidential
contest, then-Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush
held 90% loyalty among their party adherents in California, but Gore
won the independents, 54% to 38%, and that contributed to his big win
in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Who are these independents? A lot of new and first-time voters,
including many Latinos. As many as one in three Latino voters
registers independent. Independents also include high-tech workers
and wealthy women, who are fiscally conservative but socially
liberal. If Simon is to break through against Davis, he must win over
independently thinking voters.</TE>
<TE>   Wealthy white voters have abandoned the California Republican
Party. In November 2000, The Times national exit poll found that,
among families earning $40,000 to $59,999, Bush received 46% of the
vote. Among voters making more than $60,000, Bush got 43%. Newly
wealthy working women--lawyers, doctors, executives, etc.--have voted
Democratic, often against their own economic interests, because of
social issues like abortion. As men move up the economic ladder, they
become more Republican; this has not happened with women. The
Republican Party's image problem with women, crystallized in the
abortion issue, has kept high-income women from moving to the
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   So, the conventional wisdom goes that Simon, the "anti-abortion
conservative," cannot win in November because the independent
electorate of high-techies, Latinos and rich women will vote against
him. Problem is, Simon may not be that conservative. It turns out
that this "conservative Republican" enrolled as neither Republican
nor Conservative, but as an independent, when he lived in New York,
where you enroll by party and could choose either the Republican or
Conservative parties.</TE>
<TE>   His sole foray into California politics, before running for
governor, seems to have been a contribution of $10,000 to a liberal
ballot measure making it easier to raise property taxes, done at the
behest of Riordan. He also cannot be tied to the "great Satan" of
Latino politics, the 1994 anti-immigrant Proposition 187, since it's
not clear how he voted on it.</TE>
<TE>   Simon may be an improbable hero to the right-wing movement, who
rallied to him more out of distaste for Riordan. He may also be the
most improbable gubernatorial nominee since Reagan burst on the scene
in 1966. While Reagan was unabashedly conservative, he had taken few
stands on state issues before he ran for governor, and his campaign
shaped an appealing figure who could not be demonized by the
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Simon should become what the Bush White House, 80% of GOP
representatives and most GOP legislators thought Riordan was when
they endorsed him--the guy who can reach out to independents and
voters disaffected with Davis. He also needs to be seen as Reagan
was--a candidate who's philosophically conservative but not
threatening.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-six years ago, Gov. Pat Brown's handlers figured he would
more easily beat a right-wing ex-actor than a liberal Republican
big-city mayor, and intervened in the GOP primary to get Reagan
nominated. Now Davis has tried the same trick. We'll know in eight
months if it worked.</TE>

<HD>Who's Liable for Leased Unit's Rent If Tenant Dies?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN POSTEMA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: If an elderly tenant signs a one-year lease but then dies
before the term of the lease is up, can the landlord hold the
tenant's heirs liable for the rent for the remaining time the unit is
unoccupied even though they were not privy to nor a party to the
contract? Also, can the owner charge the heirs for alleged repair
costs that exceed the tenant's security deposit?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The heirs cannot be held liable for any unpaid rent or
damages arising from the death of a tenant. The estate of the
deceased, however, can be held liable for unpaid rent for the balance
of the lease or until the unit is re-rented, and for damages and
cleaning costs. The owner must still make good-faith efforts to
re-rent the apartment as soon as possible, and he cannot charge the
estate any rent after the apartment is re-rented.</LD>
<LD>   Charges for repairs are limited to damages that exceed "normal
wear and tear," and cleaning costs are limited to the actual costs of
cleaning. Damages can include such things as unreturned or lost keys
or remotes. If you don't return all of the keys and the owner has to
re-key the lock, you are liable for those costs too.</LD>
<TE>   If there is insufficient estate money to pay all claimants, the
payoff is prorated among the creditors. The owner still can use
security deposit money to pay for unpaid rent, damages and cleaning
until it is gone.</TE>
<TE>   New Owner Wants Fee for Space in Garage</TE>
<TE>   Q: We have lived in a Los Angeles rent-controlled apartment for 12
years. The apartment sold recently, and I received a notice from the
new owner saying that I am no longer allowed to park my car in the
garage unless I pay an additional fee of $100 per month per car space
or $200 for the whole garage.</TE>
<TE>   Although the rental agreement doesn't say anything about it, I
have been allowed the full use of the two-car garage during my entire
tenancy. In fact, the former owner even allowed me to install an
automatic garage door opener after I got my first car.</TE>
<TE>   Yesterday, the apartment manager called me and threatened to evict
me if I continue to use the garage without paying the additional
$100. Can I be evicted if I continue to pay my rent on time and park
my car in the garage without paying?</TE>
<TE>   Because I cannot afford to hire an attorney and may have to
represent myself in court, could you cite the part of tenancy law
that pertains to this problem?</TE>
<TE>   A: All of the terms and conditions of your rental agreement pass
over to the new owner when he takes title to the property. And while
he may not be aware of it, rental agreements can be both written and
oral. It may be a little harder to prove that your oral contract with
the former owner--allowing your use of the garage--exists,
particularly when there is a written agreement that does not
reference it. But it is still valid. Since you had the use of the
garage for 12 years, you should have little trouble proving your case
in court.</TE>
<TE>   If you were allowed use of the entire two-car garage as a part of
your former tenancy, and not just the half in which you park your
car, you still have the use of the entire garage under the new
ownership at no additional rent or fees.</TE>
<TE>   That may not completely solve your problem. Under rent control,
the owner can take away the use of the garage from you, called a
reduction of services. He also must decrease the rent for reducing
services by the amount of the value of the service, apparently $100
to $200, depending upon how much use of the garage you had, half or
all.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, even if you had rented the garage under a separate
services agreement, which is required under rent control, you could
not be evicted from the apartment for not paying the garage rent. You
could be evicted from the garage for failing to pay its rent.</TE>
<TE>   All of this is covered in the city of Los Angeles' Rent
Stabilization Ordinance. To get a copy of the law, call the Rent
Stabilization Division at (213) 367-9099.</TE>
<TE>   Correct Language for Use in Rental Agreement</TE>
<TE>   Q: In a previous column, you specified language to include in a
lease or rental agreement allowing a landlord to collect attorney's
fees from a tenant after an eviction in court. Your language is
different from mine, and yours limits the amount of the attorney's
fees to $500.</TE>
<TE>   Does the language used in the contract have to be exactly what you
wrote or can it be different? Also, are attorney's fees limited to
$500? Is there a disadvantage to using my language instead of yours?</TE>
<TE>   A: The language in your agreement does not have to exactly match
the language in the rental agreement of the Apartment Assn. of
Greater Los Angeles, which I quoted. The language in your agreement,
"The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all expenses which
may be incurred, including reasonable attorney's fees, by reason of
any breach of this agreement," is fine.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is that you are not limited to recovering $500 in
attorney's fees with your language. Placing a $500 ceiling in the
agreement limits both your and the tenant's liability to that amount.</TE>

<HD>Lending to Minorities Examined</HD>
<DH>Ratings* Lawmaker asks why banks with few loans going to
underserved buyers receive high marks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to close the homeownership gap between whites and
minorities, Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland) has requested a meeting this
month with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, banking
regulators and high-ranking Bush administration officials to question
the Community Reinvestment Act rating system.</LD>
<LD>   The rating system tracks and evaluates a bank's performance in
making loans to low-income home buyers. Under the current system,
which Greenspan endorsed in a recent hearing, many of the largest
banks in California--those with $10 billion or more in assets--have
received "outstanding" lending grades, even when less than 3% of
those banks' conventional home loans went to African Americans.</LD>
<LD>   A conventional home loan is a loan that is at or below the Fannie
Mae/Freddie Mac conforming loan limit of $300,700 and written to
their standards.</LD>
<TE>   The lending pattern for Latinos was about the same, according to a
study conducted by the Greenlining Institute, an alliance of church,
consumer, civil rights and small-business groups based in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Homeownership is the only way of acquiring equity and achieving
the American dream," Lee said. "We need to see how these ratings are
evaluated and make sure homeownership rates increase in the minority
communities."</TE>
<TE>   Lee asked the Greenlining Institute to analyze home-lending data
provided by the Federal Reserve Board, in response to Greenspan's
comments at a July appearance before Congress' Financial Services
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   At that hearing, the Fed chairman said that the reinvestment act
rating system is an effective method to influence banks to increase
lending to underserved minorities.</TE>
<TE>   The Greenlining Institute's analysis revealed, however, that of
the 13 major banks that made more than 200 conventional home loans in
California in 2000, the majority provided less than 3% of those loans
to African Americans. Despite these low percentages, all of the
institutions making less than 3% received either an "outstanding" or
"high satisfactory" grade on the rating system's lending test.</TE>
<TE>   Citibank ranked lowest in the percentage of conventional home
loans to Latinos, less than 5%. Yet it, too, received an
"outstanding" CRA rating. United Bank of California received a "high
satisfactory" rating, although less than 1% of its conventional home
loans went to African Americans, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   "When you euphorically state that banks are doing a good job, the
pressure is taken off those banks to increase the number of home
loans they make to minorities," said Robert Gnaizda, general counsel
for the Greenlining Institute. "If we can change the CRA rating
system, I believe it would double, at a minimum, the number of home
loans made to African Americans, Latinos and Southeast-Asian
Americans over the next three years."</TE>
<TE>   Bob McNeely, the community reinvestment officer at Union Bank of
California, said that the reinvestment act rating system is an
income-based instrument that evaluates how banks lend and reinvest in
low-income communities; it is not racially or ethnically based.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the law, it is illegal to ask information about race, so we
can't track it; that was instituted so that banks would be blind in
their decisions about lending," McNeely said. "Rep. Lee's heart is in
the right place, but at the end of the day, she happens to be
targeting the wrong law to try to affect change. It would be better
to create a new one."</TE>
<TE>   McNeely added that Union Bank of California has placed community
development officers in low-income neighborhoods to help provide
homeowner counseling and other outreach activities.</TE>
<TE>   The bank also provides "equal opportunity" loans that are
one-eighth below the market rate for similar loans.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual, which made 1.9% of its 1999 home loans in
California to African Americans and 13.2% to Latinos, has made a
commitment to double that number over the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   It also has earmarked $375 billion nationwide for single-family
home loans to borrowers earning less than 80% of the area median
income, said Bob Flowers, president of community investment and
development for Washington Mutual.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America, whose percentage of home loans to Latinos dipped
to 16.5% in 2000 from 18.5% a year earlier, made a 10-year,
$350-billion commitment in 1998 to invest in low- and moderate-income
communities nationwide, said Bank of America spokeswoman Julie Davis.</TE>
<TE>   In a Feb. 20 letter to Greenspan, Lee recommended that the Senate
and House hold hearings at which bank regulators could explain their
grades, and financial institutions and community groups would have an
opportunity to offer suggestions about closing the homeownership gap.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to increase minority homeownership, period," Lee
said. "It's good for the banks and good for the families."</TE>

<LD>Betty Harvey offers this advice for buying or selling a house: "Ask,
ask and ask some more."</LD>
<LD>   That was Harvey's strategy when she set out to buy in La Quinta, a
growing desert community of 25,000 about 20 miles southeast of Palm
Springs.</LD>
<LD>   An educator, Harvey asked co-workers if they knew of any homes for
sale, she asked locals how much they paid for electricity to cool
their homes during blistering summer months and she asked an escrow
officer what steps were required to buy directly from an owner. Then,
she walked the streets of La Quinta Cove, a slightly bohemian
neighborhood at the foot of the Santa Rosa Mountains where she
considered buying, and asked neighbors about the area.</LD>
<TE>   Harvey began her search in 2000 after accepting a position with
the Coachella Valley Water District. Putting her Escondido home on
the market, she first investigated renting in La Quinta for herself,
her Rottweiler-boxer mix and her two cats. She quickly discovered two
things: "Rents are through the ceiling," and "It's hard to find a
nice place to rent when you have a dog."</TE>
<TE>   Before looking to buy, Harvey got pre-approved for a loan through
Eli Lopez, a loan broker with Sea Breeze Mortgage in Rancho
Cucamonga, who determined that a federally insured FHA loan would be
best for her.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a lot of great questions," Lopez said. She asked about
fixed versus variable rates, prepayment penalties, federal
nondiscrimination disclosure requirements and a host of issues that
arose as she carefully read the stacks of forms she was asked to sign
throughout the process.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey then searched newspapers and looked for for-sale signs on
front lawns. She took her time and, having successfully bought and
sold at least six properties since first becoming a homeowner in
1972, she felt confident she would find something.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2001, a co-worker pointed out an ad in the Desert Sun
newspaper for a French country, three-bedroom, two-bath,
1,700-square-foot tract house being sold by the owners for $137,000.
As well as being in Harvey's price range, it had features she wanted:
a kitchen open to the living room so she could see the fireplace
while cooking, and sliding French doors leading from the living room
and the master bedroom to a patio. The mountains lay to the east and
the garden faced south, an orientation she liked.</TE>
<TE>   The house was being sold by Jan and Larry Haggart, who bought it
new in 1990 and had rented it for a year after retiring to Idaho.
When the renters moved and the couple decided to sell, they brought
sleeping bags and camped out for a month while they painted and
primed the house before putting a sign on the lawn. Selling their
house without a real estate agent was not a difficult choice for the
Haggarts because they had sold their previous home in 1990 by putting
a sign out front.</TE>
<TE>   When Harvey went to look at the La Quinta house, the sign had been
up for about a week. She returned several times to look at the house
and ask the neighbors about the immediate community. At one point,
Larry Haggart took her around to meet several neighbors. "We didn't
want [to sell to] someone who would irritate the neighbors," Haggart
said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Harvey has developed a strategy for viewing homes
that are being shown by the owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell them: 'I love what you've done with it,'" she said, rather
than saying this or that feature should be torn out and replaced.
"You don't want to do that to the owners. They love their home....
Think to yourself what you would do with it."</TE>
<TE>   Once Harvey decided on the house, she offered the couple
$130,000--$7,000 less than the asking price. They countered with
$133,500, and Harvey accepted. "We split the difference," she said,
"and that characterizes everything [we did]."</TE>
<TE>   As the process moved forward, Harvey and the Haggarts developed a
good working relationship. While the couple had been approached by
three real estate agents who wanted to list the house, and raise the
price by $10,000 to cover their commission fees, the Haggarts were
glad they turned down those offers. "Betty would have had to pay
that," Larry Haggart said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, when Harvey put her Escondido house on the
market, she happily engaged the services of an agent who could show
the house while Harvey started her new job in La Quinta. Plus,
Harvey's house and its half-acre lot were in an out-of-the-way
location where a front-yard sign would be useless.</TE>
<TE>   When the offer on the La Quinta house was accepted, Harvey made a
deposit, which was immediately put into an account by an escrow
office that the Haggarts had suggested and Harvey had checked out.</TE>
<TE>   A home inspection two days later, paid for by Harvey, revealed the
house was in excellent condition save for a needed repair on a patio
post bracket, which the Haggarts paid for.</TE>
<TE>   Before the 30-day escrow was complete, the escrow on Harvey's
Escondido house closed, and she asked the Haggarts if she could move
into the house early and pay prorated rent.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone told us not to do it," Haggart said, recalling horror
stories he heard from friends. But he and his wife had faith in
Harvey (they jokingly suggested she move in with them until escrow
closed) and confidence in the paper she signed saying she would move
out if the deal fell through.</TE>
<TE>   The escrow closed without a hitch. "I think we were very, very
fortunate to meet each other," Haggart said.</TE>
<TE>   "We maintained close, clear communication," Harvey said, "and bent
over backward, on both sides, to be reassuring that the transaction
was in both our benefits."</TE>

<HD>Mortar Smooths Out the Rough Edges of Tiling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES CAREY and MORRIS CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The big problem with installing tile--even with the small jobs--is
the unevenness of the surface (counter top, wall, ceiling or floor)
to which the tile is going to be applied. Tile seems to exacerbate
waviness in a surface. Most uneven surfaces look worse after tile is
applied.</LD>
<LD>   In a home, most surfaces are wavy to some extent. Mortar is used
to correct this kind of problem. Mortar is a substrate that can be
made to be smooth no matter how wavy the surface. In short,
troweled-in-place mortar is a backing that adds strength and
smoothness for tile.</LD>
<LD>   A mortar bed can be built to work over a waterproof layer, such as
in a shower. First, a waterproof membrane is installed, then the
mortar bed, and finally the tile and grout. When the grout fails and
water gets behind the tile and mortar, the waterproof membrane
protects the framing. All of these layers make tile in mortar very
expensive.</LD>
<TE>   Thirty years ago, builders decided to try a new technique--tiling
directly to wallboard. No mortar. At first everything looked great
and tile showers in modern subdivision homes were the rage. Soon
after the warranties ran out, however, unlucky homeowners were
spending big bucks repairing those tiled showers.</TE>
<TE>   Discovering that tile-on-wallboard wasn't a good application,
better building departments started to outlaw the technique. But
before long it was apparent that another alternative had to be found.
Wallboard wasn't the answer and mortar-in-place installations were
too difficult and expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a material was developed to replace wallboard for
wet-tile installations. It's known generically as "cement-backer
board" or "mortarboard." Mortarboard can be installed over a
waterproof barrier and has the same water-stopping qualities of tile
in mortar installation.</TE>
<TE>   Mortarboard is very different from the old-fashioned and
far-too-flimsy tile-on-wallboard. Once the grout starts to leak, the
surface below doesn't fall apart.</TE>
<TE>   Even though mortarboard resists moisture better than does
wallboard, it doesn't smooth the surface. If the studs are crooked,
the mortarboard will telescope the problem through. If you want good
results, you have to make sure the wall studs are perfectly straight
and that the face of each stud perfectly aligns with the face of each
adjacent stud before applying the waterproof plastic and the
mortarboard. Shimming and planing the studs as needed would be a
smart thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   Each manufacturer will recommend a different fastening method.
Follow the manufacturer's installation instructions to the letter.
What you do with one product might not be recommended with another.
Once the board is up, joints are taped and filled with joint
compound--usually latex-fortified mortar. Latex-fortified mortar is a
fancy way of saying mortar mixed with glue. Be sure to leave a
1/8-inch gap between sheets for expansion. Mortarboard expands and
contracts just as wood does.</TE>
<TE>   Some say that mortarboard is the answer as a base for tile floors.
We don't agree completely. Yes, mortarboard is an alternative to
plywood. However, troweled-in-place mortar is still the finest way of
doing any tile job.</TE>
<TE>   With mortarboard, the floor that it will rest on must not vary in
height more than 1/8-inch. This is a rather stringent tolerance. Most
manufacturers recommended that a thin coat of mortar be used to level
the floor before the mortarboard is applied.</TE>
<TE>   If you are extremely careful with mortarboard, the job can look
magnificent--without a lot of work, experience or cost.</TE>

<HD>When Toilet Tank Leaks, Determine the Cause First</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: How do I change a leaking toilet tank?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The first step in repairing a leaking toilet tank is to
determine where the leak is located and what is causing it.</LD>
<LD>   There are several possible causes, the most obvious of which is a
hairline crack in the tank--often virtually undetectable.</LD>
<TE>   Other possible causes are: the four factory penetrations at the
bottom of the tank where connections are made to the water supply,
where the tank is bolted to the bowl, and at the location where water
flows from the tank to the bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these locations has a rubber washer designed to ensure a
watertight connection. Over time, the connections might become loose
or the washers might deteriorate, requiring replacement.</TE>
<TE>   An easy means of determining the location of the leak is by
placing a few drops of food coloring into the toilet tank.</TE>
<TE>   Wait about an hour and return to the scene to search for colored
water at the outside of the tank. If the leak is at one of the
factory penetrations, use a wrench or a screwdriver to tighten the
connection.</TE>
<TE>   Dry the area and return in another hour to see if the problem has
been solved. If it hasn't been, try replacing the washers.</TE>
<TE>   Drain the tank by turning off the water supply and flushing the
toilet. Disconnect the water supply and remove the two bolts that
anchor the tank to the bowl. Clean the connections and openings with
a soft dry cloth and install new washers. Also install a new washer
where the tank discharges into the bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Before you tear out your toilet tank, be certain that your leak
isn't a sweating tank. This condition is caused by condensation that
occurs on the outside surface of the tank because of the difference
in temperature between the water in the toilet tank and the air in
the room. If the problem is, in fact, condensation, it can be
remedied in one of two ways--with a tank liner or a tempering valve.
The tank liner consists of a rubber membrane that is installed in the
interior surface of the tank as a layer of insulation.</TE>
<TE>   The tempering valve is a bit more complicated. It requires
removing the existing water supply valve and replacing it with a
model that mixes a small amount of hot water so that the water in the
tank isn't so cold. This eliminates condensation. The former is a
common do-it-yourself project, whereas the latter often requires a
plumber.</TE>
<TE>   A Clog in the Sewer Line May Be Causing Problem</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have a plumbing problem wherein the toilet appears to bubble
up water, and the bowl completely fills with water upon flushing. It
requires about 30 minutes for the water to drain out. When it does,
it almost completely drains out. I have tried using a plunger, but to
no avail. Please advise.</TE>
<TE>   A: You might have a clog somewhere in your sewer line. To clear
it, do the following: First get a mirror and use it to look deep into
your toilet's drain. If you see nothing, remove the toilet and see if
anything is stuck in the lower portion of its drain.</TE>
<TE>   If the toilet is OK, then the next step is to use a closet auger
(a short, flexible coil-spring cable that is used to dislodge debris
in a sewer line).</TE>
<TE>   It's usually safe for a do-it-yourselfer to attempt to dislodge
debris with a closet auger. A closet auger is made for short cleaning
runs and doesn't have the potential to damage a sewer line like the
full-sized model. The sales clerk at the hardware store can explain
how to use the smaller device.</TE>
<TE>   Once the sewer line has been cleaned, the toilet will have to be
reinstalled. Don't forget to use a new wax ring to create a
watertight seal between the toilet and the sewer line. The old wax
ring will almost certainly leak. A closet auger often solves the
problem--eliminating the need to call a plumber.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- After more than a year of defying economic trends,
home-value appreciation nationally finally has slowed.</LD>
<LD>   A new federal study confirms that the growth rate in home values
declined late last year, with the national appreciation rate nearly
flat at one-quarter of 1% during the final three months of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Note that the government did not document net deflation in
American home values, but rather a drop in the rate of appreciation
in the months following the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Home values continued to increase moderately in many major markets
around the country, despite the aftershocks of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   One such market was Los Angeles, which experienced a
fourth-quarter appreciation increase of 1.25%.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of markets, however, did experience deflation in home
values in the final quarter of 2001, most notably San Francisco, with
a 1.83% decline in values, and San Jose, with a 3.38% decline. Twelve
of the 50 states registered small declines in property values during
the same three months. But overall, housing hung on despite
recession--retaining market value in the face of an overall 2.5% drop
in the national Consumer Price Index. Virtually every major sector of
the economy saw prices decline during late 2001, but not home values.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, according to data compiled by the agency that tracks
values of existing homes, the year 2001 produced a net appreciation
rate of 6.92% for the typical home nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight measures
home-value movements through a giant database that tracks more than
15 million refinancings and repeat-sales of homes whose mortgages
were purchased by giant investors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</TE>
<TE>   Its quarterly index is considered the most sensitive in tracking
appreciation in values of existing homes.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the Los Angeles market did better than the national
average, with a net appreciation rate of 8.72% for 2001.</TE>
<TE>   What should you make of the latest federal report? Should you be
troubled by the apparent end to the heady days of high appreciation
rates? Should you fear the prospect of relatively flat home values in
the months ahead? Or is there a different message buried in the
numbers?</TE>
<TE>   For starters, be aware of the historical perspective. Seven
percent appreciation is a high annual rate of gain for houses
nationwide, even in expansive economic times. Last year's home
appreciation far outperformed just about any other financial asset
category--including stocks, bonds, gold and collectibles. National
appreciation rates for much of the last decade were in the 3% to 4%
annual range, as measured by the same agency.</TE>
<TE>   During the recession years of 1990-91, home values in several
regions of the country actually deflated. In Southern California
during the early 1990s, some communities saw housing values decline
by as much as 30%. So, on balance, 6.92% for 2001 represents a
remarkable performance.</TE>
<TE>   Moderating home appreciation rates have other economic benefits as
well.</TE>
<TE>   The housing market is like a giant food chain, with owners often
moving up and buying higher-cost properties as their incomes and
equities permit.</TE>
<TE>   But for the food chain to function, houses at the lower price
range have to be affordable to newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   Prices have to be in sync with current income levels, all the way
up and down the chain. If they're not, the sequential buy, sell and
move up process comes to a halt. Single-digit appreciation is much
healthier for the home-buying system as a whole than
double-digit--even if the latter produce huge capital gains riches
for lucky sellers.</TE>
<TE>   Moderate housing inflation also has benefits on local employment.
When companies find they can't relocate employees to certain housing
markets because of sky-high prices, they tend to shift resources--and
jobs--to more affordable markets. That, in turn, cuts at the base
supporting the high-cost local economy. The price bubble can burst.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, if you're stretching to find silver linings in low
appreciation rates, there is the matter of property taxes. Taxpayers
around the country who had been enjoying annual jumps of 10% to 15%
in value on their homes now have begun confronting the downside of
real estate run-ups: sharply higher property assessments, which
produce sharply higher property tax bills, assuming no change in the
property tax rate.</TE>
<TE>   Look for national appreciation rates more in line with the
historical average as this year unfolds--about 4%.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Picklefork Ranch in Ventura County is a working 237-acre avocado,
lemon, orange and cherimoya ranch, but it is also an estate with a
rich history.</LD>
<LD>   Edmund Converse Jr., an East Coast native known as "the
millionaire cowboy," bought the ranch plus 1,260 surrounding acres in
1908.</LD>
<LD>   Converse built a Craftsman-style house on the ranch and used
adjacent land for cattle and horses. He was survived by his second
wife, Estella, when he died in 1926.</LD>
<TE>   His widow continued to live on the ranch where she was visited by
her godfather, Charlie Duesha, described as an Arizona gunman who was
a contemporary of Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson.</TE>
<TE>   While cleaning his gun, Duesha accidentally shot a bullet into the
fireplace mantle in the main house at Picklefork Ranch. The bullet
remains in the mantel, according to the current ranch owners.</TE>
<TE>   After Estella died, the ranch was purchased by an exotic-animal
lover who kept giraffes, zebras, gnus, monkeys and ostriches in
corrals, which remain amid the longtime orchards.</TE>
<TE>   The current owners named the ranch Picklefork for their champion
English terriers, whose names all start with Picklefork and are
raised on the property.</TE>
<TE>   About the home: Among the five buildings on the ranch are the main
house, a carriage house (with upstairs chauffeur's quarters and a
downstairs apartment) and part of the barn, all of which were built
in 1908. There is also a blue-and-white cottage perched on a hill and
a rustic two-bedroom bungalow.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $2.85 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: The Craftsman-style main house has five bedrooms and three
bathrooms in 6,100-plus square feet. The house was restored in the
late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The main house also has a breakfast room, butler's
pantry with soapstone counters, a wine cellar, a river-rock fireplace
with Victorian mantel, a formal dining room with wainscoting and oak
floors, a trophy room with the Converse logo worked into a frieze and
a Victorian sunroom. There is also a 25- to 30-foot-long,
black-bottom swimming pool with river-rock walls and a waterfall.</TE>

<LD>Ben Affleck, who stars as author Tom Clancy's character Jack Ryan in
the upcoming movie "The Sum of All Fears," has purchased a Beverly
Hills-area home for close to $3 million.</LD>
<LD>   The actor purchased a compound on 2.5 acres. Built in the early
1920s, it includes a four-bedroom, two-bathroom main house plus a
guest house, separate theater, tennis court and pool.</LD>
<LD>   The gated estate is reached by way of a private drive.</LD>
<TE>   Affleck's former home in the Hollywood Hills was listed early last
year at $2.3 million, but it was taken off the market. Affleck has
owned that home since April 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Affleck, 29, co-stars with Samuel L. Jackson in the thriller
"Changing Lanes," scheduled to be released April 12. "The Sum of All
Fears," based on Clancy's novel of the same title, is expected to be
released May 31.</TE>
<TE>   Affleck, who shared a best screenplay Oscar with Matt Damon for
"Good Will Hunting" (1997), was an executive producer this year of
"Project Greenlight," an HBO series about a scriptwriting contest he
co-sponsored.</TE>
<TE>   He was also an executive producer of "Stolen Summer," the film
that won the Project Greenlight competition.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Lawyer of Nourmand &amp; Associates, Beverly Hills, represented
Affleck in his Beverly Hills-area home purchase, said sources not
involved in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Katey Sagal, who starred on the sitcom "Married ... With Children"
and is the voice of the Cyclops-like alien Leela in the Fox animated
series "Futurama," and musician Jack White have listed their Encino
home at $3.85 million.</TE>
<TE>   The couple bought the home in 1997 from actress Kirstie Alley. At
the time Sagal, an animal lover, agreed to allow two lemurs owned by
Alley to remain on the property. Alley has a private zookeeper tend
to them daily. The lemurs, Lucy and Ethel, may remain if the new
homeowners allow it.</TE>
<TE>   Built for entertainer Al Jolson in 1935, the East Coast
traditional-style home on 2.26 acres behind gates has eight bedrooms
and three fireplaces in nearly 8,400 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The estate also has a guest house, den, study, gym, pool, gazebo
and koi pond.</TE>
<TE>   Sagal, in her 40s, starred as Peg Bundy in "Married" for 11
seasons, ending in 1997. Earlier this year she played Hank Azaria's
boss on the NBC sitcom "Imagine That," which has been canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Adamson of Coldwell Banker, Brentwood, shares the listing
with Robert Bluman and Dianne Merryl of Prudential John Aaroe,
Encino.</TE>
<TE>   PGA star Denis Watson and his wife, Susan Loggans, a
personal-injury attorney, have purchased a Malibu Colony home for
about its $6.95-million asking price. The couple also have a
residence in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1993, the Malibu home has four bedrooms in 4,500 square
feet. Situated behind gates, the Tuscan-style home has an office,
gym, maid's/guest quarters, master suite with a deck on the beach and
a courtyard with a fountain.</TE>
<TE>   The home, with 32 feet of beach frontage, also has ocean views
from every room.</TE>
<TE>   The house will be available to lease from June to August at
$90,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Watson, 46, teaches and plays PGA and Nike Tour events. His best
season was in 1984 when he won three PGA Tour victories. Watson came
close then to winning PGA player of the year honors.</TE>
<TE>   Loggans, named one of the country's top 15 trial attorneys by the
National Law Journal in 1985, has appeared on such TV shows as
"Oprah" and NBC's "Today" show. She also has hosted her own
syndicated radio talk show and weekly TV show on Fox News.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Rogers of Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills, represented the
buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Actor John Stamos and his wife, actress-model Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos, have listed a 3.23-acre parcel of land in Benedict
Canyon, where they once planned to build, at just under $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The couple originally listed the land in December 2000 at about
$2.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the couple have sold their home in the mountains of
Malibu for about $2.25 million and moved to a 20-acre ranch that they
owned in the L.A. area. They refurbished one house on the ranch and
plan to build another.</TE>
<TE>   Stamos, 38, starred on the ABC series "Thieves" and played Uncle
Jesse on the ABC sitcom "Full House." He made his Broadway debut in
1995, replacing Matthew Broderick in the revival of "How to Succeed
in Business Without Really Trying."</TE>
<TE>   Romijn-Stamos, 29, is a former host of MTV's "House of Style" and
has appeared in such movies as "X-Men" (2000). She was cast as the
female lead in the remake of "Rollerball."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Babajian of Prudential Estate Properties, Beverly Hills, has
the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Former MGM Chairman Frank Mancuso and his wife, Fay, have sold
their Bel-Air home of 16 years for close to its $4.8-million asking
price. The couple has been building a new home in Holmby Hills.</TE>
<TE>   They sold their Bel-Air home to Christopher Browne, a New York
financier, and his partner, Andrew Gordon, a New York designer.</TE>
<TE>   The one-story home, on more than an acre on a promontory, has four
bedrooms, including a library-office, and six bathrooms in 9,000
square feet. Designed by architect Edward Fickett when it was built
in 1956, it was updated and enlarged later by designer Ted Grenzback.</TE>
<TE>   The house has dual master suites, each with a bathroom, a dressing
room and maid's quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Frankel of Coldwell Banker Previews, Beverly Hills,
represented the buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Robinson of DBL, Beverly Hills, and Yves Mieszala of
Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills North, had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Bieber, a producer of the upcoming comedy film "The Cat's
Meow," has purchased one of the last houses designed by the late
architect Rudolph Schindler.</TE>
<TE>   Bieber, 32, bought the Hollywood Hills house for $931,000 and now
plans to spend up to $300,000 restoring it, with the help of
DesignARC Architects of Los Angeles. The house has been considerably
altered since it was completed in 1952, a year before Schindler died.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not much like a Schindler now, but it will be when I'm
finished," Bieber said of the house, which is her first major
restoration. Her last project was a 1909 hunting cabin in Beachwood
Canyon. It had no bathroom or kitchen until she renovated the
1,000-square-foot building.</TE>
<TE>   The Schindler house has four bedrooms and four bathrooms in 2,700
square feet now, but it will have only two bedrooms and two bathrooms
in 1,500 square feet when work is completed. There were two additions
that "destroyed its integrity," Bieber said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't need 3,000 square feet," she said. "I'm a single woman,
and I'll live in it when it's finished."</TE>
<TE>   Bieber views it as an important project, "because people in L.A.
should revere their homes," especially the architectural ones, she
said. "The Cat's Meow," based on a play Bieber produced in West
Hollywood, is due out April 12. It was directed by Peter Bogdanovich
and stars Kirsten Dunst, Eddie Izzard and Jennifer Tilly.</TE>
<TE>   Konstantine Valissarakos, director of historic properties for DBL,
Los Feliz, represented Bieber.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Please warn our favorite Broadway star Carol Channing ("Her Desert
Stage" by Ruth Ryon, March 3) to remove that four-drawer file cabinet
and lamp from her bedside in Rancho Mirage. One mild 4 a.m.
earthquake tremor could send the lamp crashing down on the bed
pillows. Two two-drawer files placed side-by-side (with lamp for
bedside reading) will enhance the bedroom appearance and make an
excellent place for one more of the Hirschfeld sketches.</LD>
<LD>   While we're on subject of quake safety, clay or quake "glue" to
hold wall pictures securely above a headboard is another needed quake
safety reminder.</LD>
<LD>   You can't dodge falling objects in one or two seconds of quake
heaving, so anchor each object securely, and avoid regret and injury
later.</LD>

<HD>Make Sure Your Remodel Fits Into the Bigger Picture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Too often, demolition precedes design, according to a designer who
routinely sees home improvers tiptoe their way to results that are
skillfully done but short on aesthetics.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners should copy the "user base" approach taken by
professional designers, said Melissa Birdsong, director of trend
forecasting and design for Lowe's, a national chain of home centers.
This process examines the relationship of design to who will use the
room and how they will use it.</LD>
<LD>   "People need to begin, always, with the purpose of the project,"
Birdsong said. "They must decide if the project will increase value,
livability, function or their happiness and well-being."</LD>
<TE>   Everyone with a stake in the project must be on board to avoid
post-improvement finger pointing. "The purpose for making home
improvements should be driven by family needs and wants," Birdsong
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of bath remodeling, design should revolve around the
family's daily routines and cleanup habits--if users are right- or
left-handed, how many will use the bathroom, or if it is a child or
guest bath.</TE>
<TE>   "Only after the old vanity is removed and the great new pedestal
lavatory is installed do [people] realize they forgot to think about
where towels will be stored," Birdsong said. "Then they have the
reaction, 'Oh, I didn't think about that.' Despite perfect
workmanship, the results can be less than hoped for."</TE>
<TE>   She suggests homeowners retreat to the three Rs--reading, research
and reconnaissance. Check out what's new in magazines. Ask questions
of friends and contractors. Go online. Visit stores and explore, not
just for tools for but the latest materials to lend beauty,
continuity and function to the final product.</TE>
<TE>   A common pattern, Birdsong said, is for do-it-yourselfers to cram
too much task into too little time. The sprint to the finish and the
temptation for immediate gratification often rule, and design time
gets scant consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Projects create a domino effect of sorts. Birdsong said if you
change a kitchen counter top, for example, the ripple effect impacts
floors, back splash, sink and faucets, walls, cabinets and
appliances. But if homeowners consider only matching items by color,
Birdsong said, they don't open themselves to the larger
possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We tend to treat rooms in certain ways," Birdsong said, "but it
doesn't mean we have to stay with how they are. We need to see how
rooms can be."</TE>
<TE>   Take time to think through your projects and consider your budget,
your time and your ability.</TE>

<LD>What can you do to be certain you don't have a water leak somewhere
in your home?</LD>
<LD>   First, turn off all appliances that use water, such as the washing
machine and dishwasher.</LD>
<LD>   Next, make sure that no one uses any water for at least an
hour--no toilets, sinks or faucets--inside or outside. Then record
the reading on your water meter. At the end of the hour, recheck the
meter reading. If the needle hasn't moved, no leaks exist.</LD>
<TE>   If the meter has moved, a leak exists and each fixture in your
home should be checked. If you don't find the leak, it might be wise
to enlist the services of a plumber. Hidden leaks can cause
substantial amounts of damage.</TE>

<HD>Keep Track of Extra Payments</HD>

<AU>JACK GUTTENTAG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I have read your columns about the benefits of paying
early, but how do I know that my extra payments are being properly
credited?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: I have never heard of a case where a servicing agent
misappropriated a prepayment. That would be outright larceny
committed against the borrower, which is rare in this industry.</LD>
<LD>   That said, mistakes do happen, and it is a good idea to keep an
eye out for them. A few lenders have begun to give borrowers access
to their payment history on the Internet, but it will be a while
before this becomes standard practice.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, you can use an Excel spreadsheet I developed for just
this purpose. It shows your entire amortization schedule, with an
empty column for prepayments. When you enter a prepayment in the
month you pay it, the entire schedule is recalculated.</TE>
<TE>   For example, you take out a loan for $200,000 at 6.5% for 15
years. You enter these numbers at the top of the spreadsheet, and it
gives you the complete schedule, including the balance at the end of
every month. It shows, for example, that after 12 months you will
have a balance of $191,854. If you make an extra payment of $1,500 in
month five, the schedule recalculates to show a balance in month 12
of $190,296. If the lender has properly credited you with the
prepayment, the balance shown for month 12 on the lender's statement
should be identical.</TE>
<TE>   If you enter every prepayment in the spreadsheet and save it,
monitoring your lender's bookkeeping will be a breeze.</TE>
<TE>   Monitoring amortization on an adjustable rate mortgage, or ARM, is
a little trickier. You must create a new loan on the spreadsheet
every time the rate changes. The new loan amount is the balance just
before the rate change, and the new term is the original term less
the number of months that have expired.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if the loan described above is an ARM on which the
rate changes at the end of one year, and assuming prepayment of
$1,500 in month five, the new loan is for $190,296 and 168 months.
Using the new rate determined by the lender, the spreadsheet will
calculate the new payment and the new amortization schedule.</TE>
<TE>   When Extra Payments Are at Irregular Intervals</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have tried to use the extra payments calculator on your Web
site to see when my loan will pay off, but it is for people with
regular habits who pay a certain amount at regular intervals. My
extra payments are scattered and for varying amounts. Can you help?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes, the Excel spreadsheet I just described will take account
of any number of extra payments of any amount in any month, and show
you when payoff occurs. You just scroll down the worksheet until you
get to a zero balance. Extending the example I gave above, the first
extra payment of $1,500 in month five results in payoff in 177
months. If I add extra payments of, say, $2,200 in month 11, $1,200
in month 25 and $4,500 in month 39, I find payoff in 167 months.</TE>
<TE>   You can download the Excel spreadsheet from
www.mtgprofessor.com/xtrapmts.xls. Be sure you save it to your hard
drive so you can maintain a continuing record under your own control.</TE>

<DH>By Leading China Into its First World Cup,  Milutinovic Has
Become a Folk Hero</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YUXI, China</DL>
<LD>Bora Milutinovic's weathered features and mop of gray curls seem out
of place among the pictures of lanky, young Chinese soccer players
pasted into Cai Xiaomei's scrapbook.</LD>
<LD>   But for 16-year-old Cai, watching from behind the fence as the
national team works out in tropical southwestern China, the Yugoslav
coach is every inch her hero.</LD>
<LD>   "Milu is so cool," she said, using the nickname by which he is
universally known in China.</LD>
<TE>   Millions of Chinese agree.</TE>
<TE>   They credit 57-year-old Milutinovic with making history by leading
China into the finals of the World Cup for the first time ever. The
Cup takes place in Japan and South Korea from May 31 to June 30.</TE>
<TE>   The success has made Milutinovic a folk hero in China and a
high-paid pitchman. Already ubiquitous in the sports press, he does
TV ads for rice wine and language-learning devices--a fitting
endorsement, since he doesn't speak Chinese.</TE>
<TE>   A former professional player in Yugoslavia, Milutinovic was
coaching a New York team, the Metro Stars, when China called.</TE>
<TE>   The Stars were having their worst year ever, which Milutinovic
blames in part on his being distracted and saddened by NATO bombing
in his homeland.</TE>
<TE>   China offered a fresh start.</TE>
<TE>   Milutinovic is the third foreigner to coach China. The
others--Klaus Schlappner of Germany and Bobby Houghton of
Britain--served only briefly before being fired.</TE>
<TE>   Milutinovic was already a World Cup veteran who has coached four
countries to the second round--Mexico, Nigeria, Costa Rica and the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview at the Chinese team headquarters in Yunnan
province, Milutinovic said he tries not to take Chinese praise too
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "People said, 'We waited 44 years.' I say, 'Why didn't you call me
before?'" he said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Milutinovic calls coaching a largely untested Chinese team the
"biggest challenge of my life."</TE>
<TE>   When he started, goal-hungry Chinese fans were unhappy with his
conservative style of play. They booed even when his team won.</TE>
<TE>   Sentiment shifted as he racked up wins.</TE>
<TE>   China cruised unbeaten to victory in its Asian qualifying group,
then allowed just one loss and one draw in the next round.</TE>
<TE>   When China clinched a finals berth Oct. 7, millions poured into
the streets of Chinese cities in celebration. Many hoisted pictures
of Milutinovic with "Thank You" written on them.</TE>
<TE>   "When you win games, everybody loves you," he said with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   Milutinovic warns fans not to expect too much. He calls China one
of the four weakest teams in the Cup and says just getting into the
final is a tremendous achievement. He says moving on to the next
round is far from assured.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to understand, they've never played the World Cup. It's a
different ambiance. Everything is different, but we're going to work
hard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   China is in Group C, where it faces formidable competition from
former world champion Brazil, plus Costa Rica and Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   But Milutinovic says China has strong assets in its excellent
teamwork, good strategic play and massive fan support.</TE>
<TE>   The first games of the finals in South Korea are just a short
flight or ferry ride away for fans in China's northeast.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our team is really much better than the other teams. This
is reality," Milutinovic said. "We play better. We play a lot of
soccer. We have excellent attitude, excellent spirit."</TE>
<TE>   On the field, Milutinovic shouts orders and approval in a
disorienting, sometimes off-color mix of Serbian, Spanish and
English. A translator who is always at his side renders it into
Chinese.</TE>
<TE>   Coaching through a translator poses no special challenge, because
"the game is the same around the world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Often, Milutinovic jumps in on practice drills like a man
one-third his age.</TE>
<TE>   The enthusiasm has rubbed off on players, who run through a
strenuous but good-humored practice. Used to stern drills, they call
it "happy soccer."</TE>
<TE>   "I can't run like 20 years ago, but always I try to play the game
to show them what it's like to enjoy what you do," Milutinovic said.</TE>
<TE>   At other times, he's deadly serious.</TE>
<TE>   For two hours after lunch, Milutinovic bans cameras as he runs an
experimental goalie drill with the help of Yugoslav trainers.</TE>
<TE>   An Qi, a goalkeeper, said Milutinovic has a rare insight into what
makes a team mesh.</TE>
<TE>   "Milu has rich experience. He's brought cohesion and
competitiveness to our team and unity is extremely important to a
team," An said.</TE>
<TE>   Fans watching through the fence call Milutinovic the key to
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say success this time is definitely 80 percent due to Milu's
leadership," said a college student who would give only his surname,
Hu.</TE>
<TE>   Milutinovic won't rule out coaching in China in the future but
says the Cup is all that matters for now.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm only thinking now of sharing with the players my experience
in the World Cup, my soccer experience to help them to learn as much
as possible in the next months," he said.</TE>

<HD>Nothing Minor About Their Dreams</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: The NBA's developmental league is keeping
hopefuls in the sights of scouts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FAYETTEVILLE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Omar Cook knew he had messed up.</LD>
<LD>   Cook had left St. John's as a freshman and entered the NBA draft,
becoming a second-round pick of the Denver Nuggets. He was cut in
October, and signed with the Dallas Mavericks a month later.</LD>
<LD>   But he arrived out of shape and didn't work hard enough once he
got there--a combination that forced the Mavs to cut him five weeks
later.</LD>
<TE>   That sent him to Fayetteville, where he plays in front of sparse
crowds for blue-collar pay -- all to get back to the big time through
the National Basketball Development League, the NBA's first-year
minor league.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't matter that fewer than 1,900 people saw his 18-point,
19-assist effort in a win against the North Charleston (S.C.)
Lowgators on Feb. 8. Cook and the rest of the NBDL players cling to
one fact as tenaciously as they do their hoop dreams: The scouts are
watching.</TE>
<TE>   "Something always happens in the NBA--guys get hurt," Cook said
before the game. "A whole bunch of things happen and you know the
first league that they're looking at is here.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is probably the best thing that ever happened to
me."</TE>
<TE>   This league is made for guys like Cook, the has-beens and
not-quites who are trying to turn dream into reality for $27,500 a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Many had stellar college careers or have spent time with NBA
squads.</TE>
<TE>   Asheville's Chris Carrawell was the 1999-2000 Atlantic Coast
Conference player of the year while at Duke. His teammate on the
Altitude, Jimmy King, was a member of Michigan's Fab Five in the
early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   North Charleston's Makhtar Ndiaye played on two Final Four teams
while at North Carolina. Teammate Terry Dehere was Seton Hall's
all-time leading scorer and 3-point shooter.</TE>
<TE>   With the league's eight teams pushing into the final weeks of
their 56-game seasons, six NBDL players have signed NBA contracts as
of Tuesday. Four were for the remainder of the season.</TE>
<TE>   But Rob Levine, NBA senior vice president of new league
development, said he hoped to see several NBDL players compete in NBA
summer leagues and training camps heading into next season.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very optimistic," Levine said. "I think it's a long-term
project, a slow build, that is benefiting the NBA in so many ways.
...</TE>
<TE>   "Not everybody is going to be an NBA player or star. But you can
keep playing ball and we'll give you the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the draw is chasing that opportunity in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell McIntyre, Cook's backcourt mate in Fayetteville, spent two
seasons in Europe before signing with the NBDL. He was allocated to
the Patriots because of his regional ties; he graduated from high
school in nearby Raeford.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-9 guard was NBDL player of the month in January. He
ranks among the league's leaders in four categories and owns the
league single-game scoring record of 36 points in the win against the
Lowgators.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really a no-brainer," said McIntyre, who finished his
career as one of Clemson's all-time scoring and assists leaders. "You
get seen by NBA scouts every night. You weren't getting that kind of
look overseas. The money was OK--a lot better than here--but the
opportunity here is a lot better."</TE>
<TE>   Players aren't the only ones getting a look. The NBA is also using
the league to develop referees and front-office personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Levine points out, there's more to it than just shooting
drills.</TE>
<TE>   There's a continuing education program to help players complete
unfinished coursework or pursue other opportunities. The league helps
players find offseason jobs and internships. It pairs them with
former pro players as mentors.</TE>
<TE>   There's even career counseling--complete with resume writing and
interview skills--to prepare them for life after basketball.</TE>
<TE>   That life will come sooner than many players hoped.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very important part of what we do," Levine said.</TE>
<TE>   As with any first-year venture, however, there have been growing
pains, said Patriots coach Jeff Capel, the former Old Dominion coach.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the travel is by bus--a tiring prospect considering 650
miles separate the league's northernmost city--Roanoke, Va.--from its
southernmost--Mobile, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be better, but that gives you something to work for,"
Capel said. "If we were flying in our own jets and everything, I
don't think the guys would be as inclined to work as hard.</TE>
<TE>   "It ain't bad when you're flying. But when you're on an eight-hour
bus ride, you realize that, 'Hey, I want to get to that next level
where I've got private jets, so I'm going to shoot an extra 100 shots
tonight.'"</TE>
<TE>   Attendance hasn't been quite what officials had hoped, averaging
around 1,600 fans a night through mid-February. League officials
hoped to average around 3,000, but lowered their expectations because
of Sept. 11 and the economic slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots lead the league in attendance with an average of
2,060.</TE>
<TE>   Levine said the numbers have steadily increased since the league
opened in November, and that the average attendance for the weekend
of Feb. 23-24 hovered around 3,000.</TE>
<TE>   League games feature promotions and contests. The Patriots hand
out surveys at games, allowing fans to evaluate everything from the
quality of play to the arena's music--even whether the team gives 100
percent .</TE>

<LD>How the mighty have fallen! Or maybe they simply were pushed off
their pedestals by the previously downtrodden. What has happened in
the Big East Conference this season may be nothing more than a
reflection of college basketball dynamics throughout the country in
2001-2002.</LD>
<LD>   After all, what could be more surprising than the utter collapse
of North Carolina, which will miss the NCAA Tournament for the first
time since 1974, unless it's the implosion of the Arkansas program
and the departure of Coach Nolan Richardson? Well, look to the west
where the top team in a region generally dominated by the likes of
Arizona, UCLA or Stanford is none other than the big spoke of
Spokane, Gonzaga.</LD>
<LD>   Compared to that kind of upheaval, the shifting fortunes of the
Big East appear relatively tame.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, it is noteworthy the schools that once comprised the
backbone of the wildly successful basketball union, that accounted
not only for its first two national championships but for its
television networking--Georgetown, Syracuse, St. John's and
Villanova--have been commanded to appear today at Madison Square
Garden for the initial games of the Big East postseason championship.
Meanwhile, former have-nots Pittsburgh, Miami and Notre Dame, along
with a Connecticut program that Jim Calhoun has built into a
powerhouse in his 16 years on the job, have earned first-round byes.
Consider it a triumph of meritocracy.</TE>
<TE>   And it mirrors the transformation that has taken place across the
land. Is there a better example of parity than the Big Ten where four
schools--Illinois, Ohio State, Indiana and Wisconsin--finished the
regular season in a tie for first place, relegating Michigan State, a
participant in the Final Four in the previous three seasons, to
fifth? And what about the goings-on in the Pac-10, where Oregon
clambered past Arizona, Stanford, USC, California and UCLA to claim
the top spot for the first time in memory? Then again, those
perennial SEC powers Kentucky, Florida, Tennessee and Arkansas all
wound up trailing Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   In that context, it's perfectly understandable that Pitt, with one
winning season in the conference in the previous 10 years, would zoom
to the top of the conference's West Division after being relegated to
sixth place in a preseason vote of the league coaches. Or that
Rutgers would rise from a history of futility in the conference to
beat four ranked teams at home and achieve a .500 mark in the Big
East. For the Scarlet Knights, a first-round game against defending
champion Boston College is infinitely preferable to no game at all,
which was their postseason fate a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The times they are a-changing almost everywhere. Duke continues to
rule in the ACC, of course, but even there the Blue Devils face a
severe challenge from Maryland. And Kansas, as usual, is the top bird
in the Big 12, where Oklahoma presents a pretense of a chase. As for
the other major conferences, however, the Big East, SEC, Pac-10 and
Big Ten are represented by only one member in the AP Top 10. And none
of the four--No. 7 Pitt, No. 8 Alabama, No. 9 Oregon and No. 10
Illinois--appears to be a significant threat to win a championship.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, the lack of a heavy favorite appears to give added
significance to conference tournaments that exist mainly to pad the
general funds of the member institutions. The presence of Georgetown,
Syracuse, St. John's and Villanova on the first day is reason enough
to believe each needs to win a minimum of one game to justify a berth
in the NCAA Tournament field that will be selected Sunday. Any
guarantees have been claimed by the four teams with byes.</TE>
<TE>   It's an interesting position in which to find the former Big Four.
Dick Vitale gushed over the coaching trinity of John Thompson, Lou
Carnesecca and Rollie Massimino, never more so than in 1985 when
their teams all reached the Final Four. Two years later, Jim
Boeheim's Syracuse Orangemen achieved the first of their two
appearances in a championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Calhoun has become a coaching star but the names showcased at the
Garden this week include Ben Howland, Mike Brey, Perry Clark, Mike
Jarvis, Craig Esherick, Jay Wright and Gary Waters.</TE>
<TE>   The old order changeth. Those who think of the Big East in
conjunction with the fierce battles for supremacy among Georgetown,
Syracuse, St. John's and Villanova may stand accused of living in the
wrong century.</TE>

<HD>Suddenly, Jaguars are a Tough Sell</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Owner and coach are pressing the flesh in
attempt to turn around a downward spiral in attendance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>With a drink in hand (ice water), and a story or two to tell,
Jacksonville Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin worked the room--shaking
hands, signing autographs and making nice with all the fans who came
to see him.</LD>
<LD>   "No, this really is not me," Coughlin conceded, looking strangely
out of place in the country club dining room, dressed in his black
suit, blue tie and wearing an unmistakably painted-on smile.</LD>
<LD>   But this is a different time in Jacksonville, and the Jaguars find
themselves in a strange situation.</LD>
<TE>   Once an easy sell in the NFL's second smallest market, the Jaguars
have had two straight losing seasons. Ticket sales are down. Coughlin
is getting a contract extension even though the area's coaching icon,
Steve Spurrier, was available.</TE>
<TE>   In the move that might best symbolize their problems, the Jaguars
let Tony Boselli -- the first draft pick in franchise history -- go
in the expansion draft to alleviate their salary cap problems.</TE>
<TE>   It has added up to a sizable public-relations mess, and now, the
Jaguars have some explaining to do.</TE>
<TE>   They're doing the talking in a unique set of cocktail parties in
which fans can get to know Coughlin, owner Wayne Weaver and other
coaches and front office figures.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a saying we've always had in my business, and it's that
the definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing over and
over and expect a different result," said Weaver, who made his
fortune selling women's shoes before buying the Jaguars.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver came up with the idea: cocktail hour, handshaking, a formal
presentation and an extensive Q&amp;A session at about a dozen country
clubs and rotary clubs around town.</TE>
<TE>   It's a format college coaches are used to. They make annual tours
through their states to pump boosters for support and money.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that's just not done in pro football," Coughlin
said.</TE>
<TE>   In pro football, especially in a one-sport town like Jacksonville,
the product is supposed to sell itself.</TE>
<TE>   But while that axiom held true the first five years in
Jacksonville, things changed when the team slipped to 7-9 and 6-10
the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance dwindled to an average of just more than 60,000 --
8,000 fewer than the first five seasons. Season-ticket renewals went
down. A team that had never blacked out a home game in six years did
it three times in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll win more football games next year," said Weaver,
who is committed to keeping the Jaguars in Jacksonville and is
preparing the city to play host to the 2005 Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "But do I need to get Tom Coughlin out there, talking to the
public? Absolutely," Weaver said.</TE>
<TE>   Coughlin's speech to fans could have come straight from a
corporate CEO's restructuring memo. The theme: Change and
reality--the Jaguars have changed plenty lately, and now fans must
face the reality that this roster will never look the way it did when
Jacksonville made the AFC title game twice in four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "But I also want to make them understand that there is hope,"
Coughlin said. "We've become a one-year league."</TE>
<TE>   As much as the message, however, fans are coming out to meet the
man. In seven seasons, Jaguars fans have never really gotten to know
Coughlin much beyond the militaristic caricature he's portrayed as in
local and national media.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't do TV commercials. He keeps public appearances to a
minimum. He doesn't make a splash about his charity work.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mind doing that stuff, but it's just a question of how
you're going to spend your time," Coughlin said. From early reviews,
the mix-and-mingle act appears worth the trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Anderson says he'll renew his season tickets based largely on
his positive experience with Weaver and Coughlin.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see him every day," Anderson said. "It's kind of nice
just to stand there and talk to him."</TE>
<TE>   Another fan, Harvey Bernhardt, was equally impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "He's no Bobby Bowden, but it was great," Bernhardt said. "It's
nice to have him talk about the issues, and try to explain some of
the salary cap stuff the general public doesn't understand."</TE>
<TE>   Coughlin is, in a sense, the opposite of Spurrier, who built the
program at Florida largely on the cult of his sometimes-prickly,
always-entertaining personality.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier turned Jacksonville into a key recruiting base, and
adopted it as something of a home away from home. He seemed the
perfect fit for the Jaguars when he resigned in January. When Weaver
all but ignored Spurrier--the owner announced he would give Coughlin
a contract extension on the day Spurrier resigned--Jaguars fans
howled in protest.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Tom has done a brilliant job, and he's the coach for this
franchise," Weaver said. "We tied his hands with our salary cap."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Coughlin played a big role in it, too. He has final say
on all personnel matters.</TE>
<TE>   Besides passing on Spurrier, the decision to let Boselli go in the
expansion draft was one of the most unpopular in the franchise's
short history. Mark Brunell complained. Fans were outraged. Weaver
called it the most distasteful thing he's ever had to do in business,
and now he's trying to make amends.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there comes a time when you have to say, 'It's time to
move forward,'" Weaver said. "I think there are a lot of thoughtful
people out there who have come to recognize what we did and why we
did it."</TE>

<HD>McGwire, Cards Both Move On</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Both the player and his ex-team are doing a good
job of handling the end of the Big Mac Era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JUPITER, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Jim Edmonds' cell phone rang, awakening the St. Louis Cardinals'
centerfielder from a nap as the team rode a bus to Fort Lauderdale to
play the Baltimore Orioles.</LD>
<LD>   It was Mark McGwire, calling from his southern California home and
reveling in his new life of leisure.</LD>
<LD>   According to Edmonds, the former home run king isn't missing
baseball, or spring training, or the media.</LD>
<TE>   "I said, 'Everybody's still talking about you.' I told him that
they're still bugging me every day and he said, 'Tell them to stop!"'
Edmonds said.</TE>
<TE>   McGwire, 38, appears to be happy in retirement. He's engaged,
wants to start another family, has bought a new home and is not
interested in revisiting the glory years.</TE>
<TE>   General manager Walt Jocketty has never made a better deal than
getting McGwire on the trading deadline in 1997. Big Mac ushered in
home run inflation to the game, hitting a then-record 70 in 1998 and
65 more the following year.</TE>
<TE>   Financially, the McGwire years were the best of times for the
team, with lots of sellouts at Busch Stadium and on the road.</TE>
<TE>   He even turned batting practice into an event, routinely swatting
10 or more balls over the wall and sometimes denting scoreboards in
the process. Fans lined up hours before game time just to watch him
get his early cuts, oohing and ahhing with each moon shot.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of days, what he was doing and when he was taking batting
practice, it was part of the show," manager Tony La Russa said. "We
don't have that same situation now."</TE>
<TE>   La Russa managed McGwire for all but one of his 16 major-league
seasons, and he tried mightily to persuade Big Mac to return after he
batted just .187 last year. La Russa reasoned that McGwire, with an
offseason of rehabilitation and conditioning, could easily contribute
30-40 home runs to the Cardinals' quest for a third straight NL
Central championship.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew what I felt, and he was dead-set on retiring," La Russa
said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, even La Russa has let go. Partly, he does this in deference
to Tino Martinez, the free agent first baseman they signed as
McGwire's replacement.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a definite presence," La Russa said. "It's fair to say we
miss him as a teammate. But I think we're excited we have the first
baseman we have."</TE>
<TE>   La Russa also isn't certain what McGwire's departure will mean to
the team's bottom line. The Cardinals didn't exactly founder the last
two seasons while he was battling knee injuries, going to the
playoffs both years, and they were also-rans his two biggest years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the big leagues are a distraction anyway," La Russa said.
"There's distractions every day. I just think it's one of those
non-issues."</TE>
<TE>   They will miss his leadership, although it wasn't prototypical.
From time to time McGwire felt compelled to speak out on baseball's
big-ticket issues, often railing about the lack of a labor deal.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a definite leader in the clubhouse, even if he didn't say
a whole lot," Drew said. "To not have him over there is a little bit
different."</TE>
<TE>   Now there's a void that no one really is eager to fill. Edmonds is
the resident big star now, but he's not claiming the clubhouse as his
own.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Tony's clubhouse, or Walt's," Edmonds said. "It's the team's
clubhouse. We're not trying to be a one-man show. And we don't sit
and talk about who's going to be the leader."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez comes from years on top with the New York Yankees, but
he's only three weeks or so into his first spring training with the
team.</TE>
<TE>   Teammates give McGwire a lot of credit for allowing the team to
reload. Beyond that, they believe it's simply time to move on.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of if we didn't get anybody for him and had a young
guy trying to take his spot, you still couldn't really say much
because he's gone. No matter what you say, he's not coming back,"
pitcher Garrett Stephenson said. "I just think we've got to turn the
page."</TE>

<HD>He's Just Happy to Be a Tiger</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Dmitri Young wanted to play regularly, and he's
showing all concerned he's glad to be getting the opportunity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAKELAND, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Dmitri Young has been perfect for the Detroit Tigers so far this
spring.</LD>
<LD>   He hits, he hustles, he smiles--and unlike some other recent
acquisitions, he's glad to be a Tiger.</LD>
<LD>   "I was looking for the first ticket out of Cincinnati," Young
said. "The one thing I've always wanted was the opportunity to play
every day, at first base, and to bat in the same spot in the lineup,
which will be fourth here. I also wanted to put some roots down in a
city for my family, and I'm excited to be able to do that in a great
city like Detroit."</LD>
<TE>   Juan Gonzalez, who left the Tigers after just one season, was one
of the first players to hate Comerica Park, with its deep fences.</TE>
<TE>   Young can't wait to hit there.</TE>
<TE>   "Other people look at it and wonder, 'How do you hit home runs?'
But I'm not trying to hit 70 home runs," Young said. "I'm trying to
hit the ball through people and into gaps, and the park is perfect
for that mindset."</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers didn't have to give up much for a switch-hitter who has
hit .300 the past four seasons. They traded outfielder Juan
Encarnacion, who hit .242 with 52 RBIs last year, and minor-league
pitcher Luis Pineda.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the significant players Detroit traded for the past two
seasons--Gonzalez and Roger Cedeno--Young made it clear he wanted to
stay and he proved it by signing a $28.5 million, four-year contract
in February. The deal could be worth up to $44 million for six
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to get a guy who wants to be in Detroit," general
manager Randy Smith said. "He's given us everything we hoped for when
we made the trade. He hits the ball extremely hard from both side of
the plate and he plays with a lot of energy, all the time. And he
already has shown that he's a great guy to have in the clubhouse,
which is another reason we went after him."</TE>
<TE>   If Young isn't smiling, it's probably because he's sleeping.</TE>
<TE>   When the 28-year-old makes eye contact with a teammate, coach, fan
or clubhouse attendant, he always seems to respond with a handshake,
a grin or a joke.</TE>
<TE>   "He's cool with everybody," second baseman Damion Easley said.
"And he's a heck of a player."</TE>
<TE>   Young hit .302 with a career-best 21 homers and 69 RBIs last year.
He had 88 RBIs in 2000, and in 1998 he hit 48 doubles, tying the best
mark in the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a superstar that is going to hit 40 homers, but he's a
good player that can hit 50 doubles and do a lot of other good things
for us," team president Dave Dombrowski said. "He's not afraid to get
his uniform dirty and he has a vibrancy about him that is special on
and off the field. And, he's not afraid to speak his mind."</TE>
<TE>   That was clear last month when Young echoed the critical comments
made by his former teammate, Pittsburgh's Pokey Reese, regarding the
special treatment given to Ken Griffey Jr. in Cincinnati last season.</TE>
<TE>   Young said he's finished bashing Griffey, but explained why he did
it.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to take the heat off Pokey," Young said. "I may
have burned some bridges in the process, but if the truth hurts, so
what?"</TE>
<TE>   Young is just beginning to show the Tigers that he was worth the
investment.</TE>
<TE>   He had eight hits, including three doubles and two homers, in his
first 13 at-bats during spring training. The 6-foot-2, 235-pounder
also has proven he's a wide body with agility by stretching singles
into doubles, and by making diving stops down the line at first.</TE>

<HD>How the West Is Done Down Under</HD>
<DH>Pioneer spirit lives on in the wineries, galleries and inns
of Margaret River.</DH>

<DL>YALLINGUP, Australia</DL>
<LD>Thirty years ago, people came to this part of Western Australia's
coast to smoke pot and ride the waves. The Indian Ocean still pounds
relentlessly, and surfers still search for the perfect tube, but when
I visited last June, the only hemp I saw was braided into macrame
plant hangers and woven into stylish clothes.</LD>
<LD>   This corner of Australia--the Margaret River region--has grown up.
Named for the river and the town that lie near its center, the area
has established a reputation as the continent's premier wine country.
Its limestone caves are renowned for their dramatic beauty. Its
forests of karri trees rival California's redwoods in age, height and
grandeur. Its scores of country inns and fine restaurants rival those
anywhere in the country.</LD>
<LD>   And then there are the beaches. Dozens of secluded stretches of
sand beckon with the promise of quiet afternoons snoozing or
smooching on isolated spits. Some are long and wide (Boodjidup Beach
in Margaret River comes to mind), while others (Lovers Beach in
Yallingup) are little spots nestled by azure water.</LD>
<TE>   Such beauty goes by many monikers. Locals call the region
"Margaret's," following the Australian propensity to shorten most
every name. The area is also known as the Cape because it sits
between Cape Leeuwin to the south and Cape Naturaliste to the north.
The latter lies about 150 miles south of Perth and its neighbor,
Fremantle, where my daughter Katie, 20, was wrapping up a semester
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Both capes boast 100-foot lighthouses that have warned mariners
away from the rocky coast for more than a century. A 75-mile hiking
trail connects the two lighthouses--icons of a rugged land.</TE>
<TE>   "Western Australia still has a bit of the pioneer spirit about
it," said Jo Tait, who converted a private home into one of
Margaret's most luxurious hotels, the 18-room Cape Lodge in
Yallingup, where we stayed. "People still believe there is
opportunity to build something of their own out here."</TE>
<TE>   The winding blacktop lane to the lodge took my wife, Colleen, our
17-year-old daughter, Betsy, and me past rows of chardonnay
grapevines bracing for winter. The low afternoon sun painted the
remaining foliage a brilliant gold as we made our way into a little
valley.</TE>
<TE>   The landscape was soothing, but our nerves were still frayed by
the four-hour drive from Perth in a tiny rented Toyota: me driving on
the wrong side of the road, my directionally challenged mate barking
instructions, all of us expecting kangaroos to bound across the
highway at any moment. Colleen needed a rest. I needed a drink.</TE>
<TE>   We parked and made our way to the entrance, native stone crunching
beneath our feet along the way. A staff member showed us to the
drawing room, where a fire roared on the hearth, leaving a hint of
pinyon in the air. Cool pink and beige walls, beautifully carved
ceiling moldings and comfortable overstuffed furniture created an
immediate and welcome respite.</TE>
<TE>   It was midweek in the off-season, so even though Colleen and I
have been married 22 years, we were given the honeymoon suite, the
lodge's nicest accommodation. We reveled in the simple elegance of
the 600-square-foot living room, which had views of a small lake and
garden beyond. Betsy was ushered down a winding path to one of the
garden villas, a 400-square-foot room that also had a view of the
lake, as well as a charming patio that caught the vestiges of the
sun. Because of the favorable exchange rate, our room was only about
$176, Betsy's about $137--full breakfast and afternoon wine tasting
included.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite time at Cape Lodge was early morning. I got up with
the sun, slipped into pants and a sweatshirt and headed out into the
morning dew to tour the estate.</TE>
<TE>   To the east lay a small stand of karri trees, a variety of
eucalyptus with skinny trunks, smooth bark and foliage that resembles
giant broccoli florets. Sunlight penetrating the forest canopy
created a strobe effect as I jogged toward the vineyards beyond.
Ring-necked green parrots broke the morning calm with their
screeches. Smaller songbirds clung to the branches of conifers around
the lake.</TE>
<TE>   Staying in the honeymoon suite, I could do no less than play the
dutiful husband, ending my morning rounds with a stop in the lodge's
kitchen for Sumatra coffee--one cup for me, one for my just-awakening
bride.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining hours of our days were spent navigating the region's
geography, which proved simple. Caves Road and Bussell Highway are
the main routes, running north-south from one cape to the other.
Caves Road hugs the coastline, while Bussell Highway slices through
the interior. Wineries, inns and galleries line both routes, with the
towns of Margaret River about halfway down the coast and Augusta at
the southern end.</TE>
<TE>   It was at Augusta where ships offloaded British settlers in 1830.
In the early 1920s, the government launched the Group Settlement
Scheme, which transported migrants from Britain's crowded cities to
Augusta and Margaret River's summer swelter. The idea was to build a
dairy industry in Margaret's. The government organized the clearing
of land, the building of houses, the digging of wells--and rewarded
settlers with real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Life was hard, and by the mid-'20s about one-third of the 3,400
"Groupies" had left. The remaining settlers, however, plodded on, and
to this day locals proudly carry on what they see as a legacy of
communal effort and hard work.</TE>
<TE>   As we drove down Caves Road, the scenery was vaguely reminiscent
of back roads in Napa Valley, at least the way they were 20 years
ago--handsome, rustic, quiet. Our next stop, arranged for us by the
lodge, was at Gunyulgup Galleries, where we visited with photorealism
painter Ashley Jones and his wife, Nina.</TE>
<TE>   The Joneses have owned the gallery for 14 years and have seen it
grow into one of Western Australia's largest, with more than 100
artists represented at any given time. Jones, 50, a surfer turned
painter, named it after an aboriginal word that means "resting place
near water."</TE>
<TE>   "You can be really free out here," he said. "And there's something
about being on top of a 20-foot wave, then looking down and seeing
the coral below. It's you, your God and the forces of nature. It's a
natural high."</TE>
<TE>   We asked Jones to show us some of his favorite spots, and he
obliged, taking us first to his studio and then to Smith's Cove, a
stone's throw away. The sun was just breaking through the afternoon
clouds, and mist hung delicately over the cove where waves pounded
one after another. Jones paused, picked up a handful of wet sand and
rubbed the little crystalline granules between his hands like a
potter smoothing out clay.</TE>
<TE>   "Come on back sometime when you have longer," he shouted as we
departed, trudging up a narrow path to the cliffs above. "You Yanks
never take the time to really get to know a place."</TE>
<TE>   Next time, he said, we would go out on surfboards so I could see
how peaceful the place can be--and then when the waves hit, I would
experience just how bloody scary they sometimes are.</TE>
<TE>   "You betcha," I mumbled hesitantly. "Can't wait."</TE>
<TE>   "When kangaroos fly," Colleen countered under her breath.</TE>
<TE>   We were ready for more roads less traveled, and the Margaret River
Regional Wine Centre pointed us in the right direction, to the
vineyards (and offered an economical way to ship bottles home).</TE>
<TE>   We drove past Leeuwin Estate, where Tricia and Denis Horgan make
some of the best Chardonnay in the country. Past the contemporary
facade of Voyager Estates and what's dubbed as "the largest
Australian flag on the continent." Past all the glassblowers,
woodworkers and other artisans whose signs dot the highway.</TE>
<TE>   A hard right along Sebbes Road took us to little-known Green
Valley Winery, operated by Ed Green, 68, a retired meteorologist, and
his wife Eleonore, 70, a retired oral surgeon. For 15 years they
commuted from Perth to a hillside vineyard at the southern edge of
the Margaret River area. Here they toiled in the vineyards on
weekends: planting, pruning, nurturing more than 30 acres of grapes.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a labor of love," Ed said as he poured Green Valley
Premium Dry White, a nice blend of colombard, chenin blanc and
Muller-Thurgau grapes. We adjourned to the kitchen table for a late
lunch of local meats and cheeses. The Margaret River Camembert and
the Tasmanian olive cheddar paired nicely with Ed's Gelignite Shiraz.
It was a lively lunch, the Greens as interested in our life in Kansas
as we were in their routine in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   The next day we visited Green Valley's winemaker, Keith Mugford,
at his more renowned winery, Moss Wood. He led us through a warren of
small buildings, ducking into a series of dark cask rooms to sample
wine in various stages of fermentation. The rooms' earthy scent
blended with the sharp smell of oak barrels stacked high all around
as Mugford poured samples of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and a hearty
Cabernet. We sniffed, swilled, spat--again and again.</TE>
<TE>   We asked Mugford what wines he had in his own cellar. His
favorites included delicate Pinot Noirs from Oregon, complex reds
from Bordeaux and Burgundy, Cabernets from Napa wineries such as
Stags' Leap and Heitz Cellars and, not surprisingly, vintages from
his own winery. (Critic James Halliday agreed with the last choice,
writing in the Australian Wine Compendium, "If I were marooned on a
desert island, and given the choice of one Margaret River vineyard,
it would rest with Moss Wood.")</TE>
<TE>   We left the quiet of Moss Wood and continued down Metricup Road to
rejoin Bussell Highway. In the town of Margaret River we stopped for
lunch at Wino's, a wine bar and restaurant with a laid-back ambience
and a southern European menu. The restaurant proved to be much like
the town: unpretentious and friendly. The roasted eggplant dip came
with toast points; the yabbies (crawfish) were bathed in white wine,
herbs and garlic butter.</TE>
<TE>   Our exploration continued with stops in the boutiques and art
galleries that line Margaret River's main thoroughfare and other
glassblowers and woodcarvers in the region. Collectors find their way
to Alan Fox's glass studio in Karridale, where Queen Elizabeth II is
said to have picked up a piece of Fox's signature blue-hued glass
when she visited last year. We saw the work of Greg Collins, who
fashions furniture from river banksia, a shrubby subspecies of
eucalyptus called mallee, 400-year-old Tasmanian pine and black palm
from Queensland.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was back to Cape Lodge for a stroll and a nap before
dinner. We were wise to rest before the culinary workout to follow.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Howell (surfer by day, chef by night) conjured delicacies
from land and sea, perfectly cooked and artistically presented:
freshly shucked oysters with a tomato-caper-lime salsa; king prawn
risotto with shaved Parmesan; char-grilled Pemberton marron
(freshwater lobster) on palm sugar-dressed greens; and braised lamb
shanks on creamy polenta. A Leeuwin Sauvignon Blanc and a Moss Wood
Cabernet accompanied the parade of dishes, which ended with a
toffee-crusted ginger-and-cardamom brulee--all fine and fitting
tastes of the new Margaret's.</TE>

<HD>Chinatown's New Fortunes</HD>
<DH>Avant-garde art and classic dining enliven this corner of
downtown L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BENDER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LOS ANGELES</DL>
<LD>In most places, Chinatown equals food, and that's usually reason
enough to visit--for lunch.</LD>
<LD>   But in the last few years, L.A.'s Chinatown has increasingly come
to mean contemporary art galleries. When my friend Andrea and I spent
a weekend here recently, we discovered a culturally rich and hip
enclave. As in other parts of downtown, commercial spaces in
Chinatown are being claimed by the avant-garde. A dozen or so
galleries lie on or near Chung King Road, a pedestrian thoroughfare
of mostly one- or two-room spaces exhibiting works by up-and-coming
artists.</LD>
<LD>   Some galleries wryly keep their buildings' original signage (Black
Dragon Society, China Art Objects, New Chinatown Barbershop), while
others are named for their owners (Diannepruess, Goldman Tevis, Lord
Mori) or contents (Electronic Orphanage). Shows tend to change about
every six weeks, so there's always a reason to return.</LD>
<TE>   While some of the galleries are cutting edge, Chinatown lodgings
are not. With top downtown hotels offering weekend specials, we
looked outside Chinatown for a deal and found it at the Wyndham
Checkers, about a mile away, which had a $69-per-night Internet
special (plus tax and an "energy fee").</TE>
<TE>   We arrived from the Westside one Friday, and the congenial staff
proceeded to "Mr. Bender" me all weekend. Our room, though not huge,
had nice linens and a marble bathroom. The rooftop spa featured a
fitness room, small pool and--the best part--a whirlpool with views
of Bunker Hill skyscrapers.</TE>
<TE>   For dinner, the concierge recommended Plum Tree Inn on Chinatown's
Hill Street, a quick drive away. We were concerned when our table was
set with forks and not chopsticks, but the Cantonese cooking proved
itself: plump vegetable dumplings, delicately sauteed asparagus and
crisp, pillowy fish filets sprinkled with diced vegetables in a light
sweet-and-sour sauce.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner we strolled around the block to Chung King Road, past
the sounds of mah-jongg tiles being shuffled and a schoolyard full of
boys playing dodge ball. Even late on a Friday we found some action:
one gallery setting up, another hosting a birthday party. Lanterns
strung above the street were too colorful to be stately, too romantic
to be kitschy.</TE>
<TE>   We ended up across Hill Street at Hop Louie, a restaurant with a
retro bar. Over a Singapore sling and a martini, we watched sports
with a mellow crowd, then drove back to the hotel for a
star-and-skyscraper-lighted whirlpool.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning the subway took us to Union Station, the site of
the former Chinatown (which is why the present enclave is sometimes
referred to as "New Chinatown").</TE>
<TE>   Our first stop was the 1890 Garnier Building on Los Angeles
Street. The structure housed Chinese immigrants until it was
half-demolished to make way for U.S. 101. The Chinese American Museum
is slated to open here next year, and plaques in the sidewalk tell
the history of L.A. County's Chinese community, which has grown from
two people in the 1850s to an estimated 330,000 today.</TE>
<TE>   We walked through Olvera Street to dim sum at CBS Seafood on
Spring Street. Dim sum is one of our favorite ways to eat: carts full
of steamed and fried treats whirring about the dining room. CBS has
one unique offering: crab claws with shrimp--deep-fried,
tennis-ball-size dumplings of crabmeat and ground shrimp, each with a
crab claw protruding from the top ($9 for three) and so crispy they
crunched. Inside they were sweet, light and juicy.</TE>
<TE>   The walk toward Chung King Road felt like China; only the
multicultural crowd reminded us where we really were. We peeked into
restaurants (some Cambodian or Vietnamese), talked with jade and gold
merchants, and browsed shops selling tea, pottery, apparel, seafood
and live poultry. Grocers hawked pistachios, pomelos and kicky
ginger-chew candies.</TE>
<TE>   At Saigon Sandwiches on Broadway we bought Vietnamese-style
baguettes ($1.89 each) of marinated chicken or shredded pork.
Outside, a man pressed juice from sugar cane, a concoction ($2) we
found dense and almost overpowering.</TE>
<TE>   Medicinal herb shops on practically every block sold ginseng (one
variety costs $888 per ounce), dried sea cucumber, red dates and
roots that looked like witches' fingers. At one shop, the
conversation went something like this:</TE>
<TE>   Me: What are these white discs for?</TE>
<TE>   Man in lab coat: What's the problem?</TE>
<TE>   Me: No problem. Just curious.</TE>
<TE>   Man: You are overweight! [Then to Andrea] You too. Stick out your
tongue.</TE>
<TE>   Me: Aaaa.</TE>
<TE>   Man: Your tongue is gray.</TE>
<TE>   Me: I just ate a ginger candy.</TE>
<TE>   Man: And your lips are dry! Do you sleep well?</TE>
<TE>   After more questions, the man in the lab coat diagnosed me with
liver and chi imbalance and prescribed two capsules of this, another
of that.</TE>
<TE>   We moved on to Chung King Road, where we spent a leisurely hour or
two strolling galleries, antiques shops and boutiques. Andrea checked
out Sling Ting for women's fashions. Most gallery owners were happy
to chat with us, and we were even invited to an opening that night at
China Art Objects.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea kept talking about David Deany's sculpture "Untitled (Floor
Jazz)" at Diannepruess Gallery. Wooden planks served as a platform
above the floor; blue light and occasional smoke emanated from below.
The sculpture on top looked like melting mint chocolate chip ice
cream.</TE>
<TE>   At Acuna-Hansen Gallery on nearby Bernard Street, works by Eric
Rosciam made us chuckle: "Super Stuff" was a heap of Oreo cookies
with the middles painstakingly sliced out; next to it, the white
fillings were stacked into a sort of totem. In the center of the
floor, Rosciam had placed "Backwash: Flowers," a cluster of mostly
empty soda bottles, each partly refilled with colored liquid,
creating the effect of a stylized flower field.</TE>
<TE>   New Chinatown Barbershop on Hill Street was showing Robin
Klimach's and Seth Ludman's contemporary photos of China: temples,
old men playing board games on street corners, and, appropriately,
hair salons. In keeping with the theme, owner Annie Shaw set up
mah-jongg and Chinese chess tables and offered free lessons. We
promised to come back Sunday and caught one of the downtown DASH
buses (25 cents per person) back to the hotel for a nap, workout and
soak in the whirlpool.</TE>
<TE>   That night we drove to Chinatown for dinner at Batavia Cafe, an
Indonesian restaurant on Broadway, where we feasted on excellent ayam
goreng Batavia (game hen marinated in soy and garlic, then fried) and
"kangkung hot plate" (a heaping dish of beef, watercress, quail eggs
and vegetables).</TE>
<TE>   By the time we arrived at China Art Objects for the opening of
Edgar Bryan's oil paintings (impressive and often moving), Chung King
Road was even busier than before. Dozens of people were dressed in
black--some looking worldly wise, others like newly minted art school
grads.</TE>
<TE>   The party was going strong at Grand Star nightclub, around the
corner from Hop Louie. Yasuko Kuwano headlined a surprisingly
talented jazz combo that occasionally took randy turns with its
lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   For breakfast the next morning, Andrea stayed at the hotel for
Tuscan eggs (poached and served on sourdough toast with
tomato-and-wild mushroom puree and a side of pancetta). I couldn't
resist driving to Philippe, a downtown institution, for a comforting
breakfast of French toast, sausage and eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea and I decided to walk off all this food with another trip
through Chinatown. Off Hill Street, the Far East Center was as busy
as Hong Kong with its crowded markets, music stores and restaurants.
We had lunch at Kim Chuy, a fusion of northern Chinese and Southeast
Asian cooking: noodle soups with duck leg or fish cakes, stir-fried
noodles, plenty of seafood dishes, Vietnamese-style fried bread. Most
entrees were under $5, and we left with plenty to take home.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinatown Heritage &amp; Visitors Center on Bernard Street (open
Sunday afternoons only) had small but smart exhibits on local
history, as well as an enthusiastic, knowledgeable staff.</TE>
<TE>   Before hitting the road, we returned to the New Chinatown
Barbershop for that mah-jongg lesson. Shaw, the owner, said she never
has been a great player, but she creamed us anyway. Mah-jongg depends
largely on luck, Shaw said, and "every time I've played in here since
the gallery opened, I've won. I think there's a spirit here."</TE>

<LD>Stock up on those energy bars. In much of the United States it will
soon be warm enough to spend the day outdoors without the Gore-Tex,
and cyclists will be eager to hit the road.</LD>
<LD>   But how and on what programs? You could choose a group tour that
costs hundreds per day, but why would you?</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of states and bicycling organizations sponsor tours every
year for as little as $20 a day (and there's one listed below for
only $10 per day), covering camping, baggage support and, frequently,
food and beverages.</LD>
<TE>   The key to these rates is the National Bicycle Tour Directors
Assn., a network of bike organizations--of which many are nonprofit
and run by bike enthusiasts, not entrepreneurs looking to make a
buck.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, most of their tours are super-cheap and beloved by
regular as well as occasional riders.</TE>
<TE>   The NBTDA Web site, www.nbtda.com, allows you to search where and
when you would like to ride and how much you are willing to spend.
You can choose a specific area of North America or just plug in a
price and time range and see what comes up. Most tours limit the
number of riders, so it's important to reserve early. And in many
cases you'll have to take your own camping gear and other supplies,
but vans or buses will carry everything except you and your bike.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a sampling of what I recently found for this spring and
summer, priced at less than $400 per person:</TE>
<TE>   * A four-day trip through Cajun country will take place from April
18 to 21. The 200-mile "Cycle Zydeco" ride is a leisurely journey
through French Louisiana; local favorites, such as crawfish and red
beans and rice, are served along the way. The cost of participation:
$200. Camping and luggage support come with the fee. Call (800)
346-1958 or go to www.cyclezydeco.com to find out more.</TE>
<TE>   * From June 9 to 15, the Oklahoma FreeWheel group winds its way
through Oklahoma and a small section of Arkansas. The price for
adults for the seven-day tour is $70--$10 per day!--and that includes
camping, luggage transport, maps, portable toilets and snacks.
Children ages 6 to 14 pay $40. For information, visit
www.okfreewheel.com or call (918) 592-BIKE (2453).</TE>
<TE>   * Wisconsin is a bike-crazed state, and one testament to that is
its eight-day "Great Annual Bicycle Adventure Along the Wisconsin
River" (or GRABAAWR). The 500-mile tour starts near the upper
Michigan border and follows the river down to the Mississippi River
at the Iowa border. Most of Wisconsin is flat or slightly hilly, and
the weather for this ride, starting June 29, should be nice. The fee:
$180 for camping and luggage transport. For details, call (888)
575-3640 or visit www.bikewisconsin.org.</TE>
<TE>   * Farther west, you can wind through 400 miles of Wyoming over six
days for $135. The "Tour de Wyoming" runs July 21 to 26 and includes
camping, trucks to carry your bags, some snacks and beverages,
T-shirts and daily continental breakfast. Go to www.cyclewyoming.org
or call (307) 742-5840 for more information.</TE>
<TE>   * At the northeast tip of the United States, an eight-day bike
tour departs July 26. The ride, called the "Lighthouse Tour," makes
its way through parts of Maine and Nova Scotia, covering 360 miles.
This tour is a bit more expensive than the others ($390), but it
includes ferry fees, hot showers, most meals, support vans and a
T-shirt, as well as baggage transport and camping. Call (207)
743-9018 or visit www.canamwheelers.com.</TE>
<TE>   It might seem obvious, but you'll need to be in decent shape and
to ride fairly regularly to make it through a bike tour and not be
miserable. As a general guide, the tours with special rates for
children or families are a little less demanding.</TE>

<HD>Baseball Exhibition Has Opening Day in New York City</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The great American pastime is getting major league treatment from a
New York museum, which on Saturday will open an exhibit that focuses
on baseball in American culture.</LD>
<LD>   "Baseball as America" at the American Museum of Natural History
will feature about 500 items, including historic bats and uniforms,
photographs, films, advertisements and paintings. It marks the first
time collections from the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum
have traveled from their home in Cooperstown, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Among the memorabilia on display will be Jackie Robinson's 1956
Brooklyn Dodgers jersey, a ticket to the grand opening of Dodger
Stadium in 1962, the bat that Babe Ruth used to score his
record-setting 60th home run in 1927 and what has been called the
most valuable baseball card ever: the T206 Honus Wagner, featuring
the 1909 Hall of Fame shortstop, which a Santa Ana businessman bought
for more than $1 million in 2000. There will even be a section
explaining the physics of fastballs and curve balls.</LD>
<TE>   The exhibit runs through Aug. 18 in New York, then will travel to
several other cities. (The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County is in negotiations aimed at offering the exhibit, a
spokeswoman said last week.) In New York, timed-entry tickets may be
bought online at www.amnh.org or by calling (212) 769-5200. They cost
$15 for adults and $9 for children ages 2 to 12, plus a $2 per ticket
service charge.</TE>

<LD>The State Department last month updated its earlier public
announcement on Colombia. Citing a worsening security situation after
peace talks between the government and rebels collapsed, it urged
U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to the South American country.
Recent warnings by the department include Iran, Liberia, Madagascar
and Pakistan. For an updated list, call (202) 647-5225 or visit
www.travel.state.gov.... After the completion of millions in
engineering work, London's Millennium Bridge reopened. The pedestrian
bridge, which spans the Thames between St. Paul's Cathedral and
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, was shut shortly after it opened in June
2000 when it began to sway, wire services reported.... In what must
be a milestone in the transformation of cruising from elite to
mass-market transportation, discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has begun
selling cruises on the Internet at www.walmart.com. (Click on
"Wal-Mart Vacations.") It's promising to refund the difference if you
can find a better deal for the Carnival, Costa, Cunard, Holland
America, Seabourn or Windstar cruises it sells.</LD>

<HD>Midway Atoll Tours Stop After Manager Pulls Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tours to Midway Atoll, the former World War II battle site in the
Pacific that was opened to eco-tourists, divers, anglers and other
visitors in 1996, were suspended after the company that managed the
tourist services pulled out. Commercial flights ended in January;
charter flights this month have been returning staff home.</LD>
<LD>   Georgia-based Midway Phoenix Corp., which managed the site, cited
an "unacceptable" relationship with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service for the decision to suspend operations at Midway. It
reportedly has lost millions on the venture. But no formal notice
ending its contract with the agency had been received as of last
week, and the two sides were still in negotiations, said Barbara
Maxfield, a spokeswoman for U.S. Fish and Wildlife. Aloha Airlines,
under contract since 1998 to make weekly flights between Hawaii and
Midway, has stopped the service.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the San Francisco-based Oceanic Society, which had
about 250 people signed up for eco-trips beginning after Jan. 19,
said the cancellation was a blow. The Oceanic Society has taken
nearly 2,000 people to Midway in recent years.</LD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A hotel at LAX is letting guests stay a full 24 hours instead of
having to observe the typical 3 p.m. check-in and noon check-out
common in the industry.</LD>
<LD>   Although some high-end hotels indulge their well-heeled guests
with 24-hour stays, the Four Points by Sheraton at Los Angeles
International Airport has extended the practice to what general
manager Phil Baxter calls "the great middle." The 573-room hotel is
rated three diamonds by AAA and three stars by Mobil (both on a
1-to-5 scale, with 5 tops).</LD>
<LD>   The 24-hour stay is good, with advance notice, on rooms priced at
$95 or more. Rooms average $99 on weekdays and $79 to $89 on
weekends, Baxter said. The hotel also offers a $99-per-night rate
that includes parking and breakfast. (800) 529-4683,

<LD>Already one of the most confusing elements of a travel purchase, trip

departure.</LD>

travel site Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com/columns/ed),
"Before Sept. 11, many trip cancellation insurance policies included
coverage for supplier failure. Following the attack, however, a
handful of companies withdrew that coverage from new policies, and
others limited their coverage to a specific list of tour operators
and cruise lines.</LD>
<LD>   "When unexpected illness or accident was the main reason to cancel
a trip, I recommended that travelers shop for the lowest price,"
Perkins added. "Now I recommend shopping for the best coverage--for
both terrorism and possible supplier failure. The issue now isn't a
small price difference; it's a big difference in potential recovery."</LD>
<TE>   While there are some glaring discrepancies in the amount of travel
insurance information you'll find online, the Web is a good place to
start the hunt.</TE>
<TE>   Once you do make a choice, most insurers provide online enrollment
and claim forms.</TE>
<TE>   Though it doesn't address post-Sept. 11 changes, the insurance
primer on the Independent Traveler site
(www.independenttraveler.com/resources, then click on "money &amp;
insurance") provides a good overview and links to several insurance
companies, including such major players as Travel Guard International
(www.travelguard.com) and Travelex (www.travelex-insurance.com). (Two
other heavyweights that aren't on the Independent Traveler list:
Access America, www.accessamerica.com, and CSA Insurance Services,
www.csatravelprotection.com.)</TE>
<TE>   A helpful site called TripInsurance.net (tripinsurance.net) offers
succinct, side-by-side comparisons of travel policies from eight
providers, including the leading four.</TE>
<TE>   The site's "financial default" line lets would-be travelers see at
a glance, for example, that CSA offers no coverage whatsoever if your
tour company or cruise line goes belly up--and that Access America
covers "selected carriers, if purchased within 14 days of initial
trip deposit."</TE>
<TE>   But to get to the nitty-gritty, you'll have to keep clicking--and
you may not like what you find.</TE>
<TE>   Because TripInsurance.net does not list terrorism as a separate
category, you'll have to scroll through the "policy highlights" to
learn what they include.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Travelex covers "terrorism in a country which is part
of the covered trip which causes the United States Department of
State to issue a travel warning that you should not travel within
that country for a period of time that would include the covered
trip."</TE>
<TE>   Travel Guard covers "a terrorist incident in a city to which the
insured is scheduled to arrive within 30 days following the
incident."</TE>
<TE>   Insurers' own sites may provide even more current information on
the constantly shifting post-Sept. 11 landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Click on Travelex's "special notices" link, for example, and
you'll find a list of airlines, cruise lines and tour operators that
Travelex will no longer insure.</TE>
<TE>   The home page for Access America, meanwhile, touts its new
"Free-to-Go" terrorism provision, included as part of the company's
existing trip cancellation/interruption policies.</TE>
<TE>   But keep reading: Among the restrictions are exclusions "for
cities in which a terrorist incident has occurred within 30 days
prior to purchase of insurance; for cities in which large, multi-day
public events attended by more than 50,000 people (the Olympics, for
example) are taking place during any portion of your trip; and for
terrorist incidents involving biological, chemical or nuclear
agents."</TE>

<LD>Taking care of your health is especially important when you are away
from home. The following items may be available in area stores.
Unless noted, price does not include shipping.</LD>
<LD>   Medications minder: Those travel pill organizers with the pop-up
lids for each day of the week may be fine for those who take only a
few pills a day, but what about folks who require more medication
than a single compartment will hold? Enter the E-Pill 7-Day
Medication Organizer &amp; Reminder Combo. Seven slim plastic cases, each
labeled with the day of the week, come with a clear lid that slides
open over four large compartments. The cases come in a
61/2-inch-square canvas storage pack with an external pocket for
stashing prescriptions or other small papers. The organizer comes
with a small battery-operated alarm (batteries included) that can be
set to beep up to 31 times a day with easy-to-program slide switches.</LD>
<LD>   E-Pill's 7-Day Organizer &amp; Reminder Combination is $59.95; (800)
549-0095, www.epill.com.</LD>
<TE>   Herbal help:  The Travel Herbal Medical Kit combines botanical
components with other first-aid essentials. Housed in a green nylon
folding bag with three zippered clear plastic pockets are echinacea
and goldenseal extract, ginger extract, aloe vera gel and arnica gel.
There's also aspirin and antihistamine, bandages, bandage scissors,
tweezers, moleskin, sterile dressing tape, gloves and other supplies.
The kit comes with instructions on the use of herbal medicine and a
guide to wilderness and travel medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Travel Herbal Medical Kit is about $55. For information, contact
Adventure Medical Kits; (800) 324-3517, www.adventuremedicalkits.com.</TE>
<TE>   Open, says me: Tamper- and child-resistant bottles may provide
extra security, but they can pose a serious challenge to people with
arthritis or other limitations.</TE>
<TE>   The inexpensive OpenAid Cap Remover solves the problem. Line up
the bottle and cap arrows, hook the plastic OpenAid over the cap top,
and pull back to open the bottle. The hooked front of the tool can be
used to tear off tamper-resistant bottle seals, puncture foil liners
and remove cotton packing.</TE>
<TE>   OpenAid Cap Remover (item 10009947) is 99 cents from the Container
Store; (888) 266-8246, www.containerstore.com.</TE>
<TE>   Smell and tell: BreathAlert, a palm-size battery-operated odor
detector, warns you if your mouth is sending out offensive
smells--and becoming a habitat for health-threatening germs.</TE>
<TE>   Just hold the monitor up to your mouth, press the button, breathe
into the microchip sensor (which detects the presence of sulfur
compounds and gas) and wait for the beep. The LED screen shows four
levels of odor. One dot means you're OK; four means get to a
toothbrush and mouthwash pronto. It runs on two AAA batteries.</TE>
<TE>   BreathAlert (WW-1335-85001) is $49.95 from TechnoScout; (866)
877-2688, www.technoscout.com.</TE>
<TE>   CO detector: The COstar P-1 Portable Carbon Monoxide Detector
detects the presence of carbon monoxide, which can be deadly to
people in a closed car.</TE>
<TE>   About the size of a beeper, the battery-operated detector clips to
the visor. Using an infrared sensor, the unit sends out a 70-decibel
alarm when carbon monoxide is detected. It comes in two models: a
small one for cars and a larger one with wall-mounting hardware for
recreational vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   COstar P-1 Portable CO Detector is $39.95 for cars, $45.95 for RVs
from the Quantum Group; (800) 432-5599, www.QGinc.com.</TE>

<HD>Do Homework on Sanitation Record Before Boarding Ship</HD>

<LD>More than 7 million North American passengers are expected to take a
cruise by year's end, according to industry estimates. Besides
concerns about safety in the post-Sept. 11 world, they want to be
reasonably assured they won't get sick while they're away. And many
also want a ship that's smoke free, or as close to it as possible.</LD>
<LD>   Cruise ship sanitation has improved in recent years, says Dave
Forney, chief of the Vessel Sanitation Program, administered by the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Under the
program, established in 1975 as part of the National Center for
Environmental Health, all passenger cruise ships arriving at U.S.
ports are subject to unannounced inspections. The program is
voluntary, but Forney prefers to call it cooperative.</LD>
<LD>   "We have the legal authority ... to conduct the inspection," he
says, "and we have a long-standing relationship with the cruise
lines." Both U.S.- and foreign-flag ships are subject to inspection.</LD>
<TE>   "The number of cruise ships scoring 100 [%] has gone up
dramatically," Forney says, crediting the improvement to increased
efforts by the cruise industry and to new ships, which are designed
for easier cleaning and maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Vessel Sanitation Program, CDC inspectors rate a ship's
water supply, food preparation and storage, the potential for
contamination of food and general cleanliness, storage and repair.
According to a revised operations manual issued in late 2000, ships
are expected to maintain more-detailed records than they formerly did
of food temperature, refrigeration logs and other data. The current
guidelines are more consistent with FDA standards. Details about a
ship's sanitation record are available from the Vessel Sanitation
Program's Web site, www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp, and by fax at (888)
232-6789.</TE>
<TE>   The scores of all inspected ships are posted on the Web site. In
mid-February, the online report included four ships with perfect
scores (100) and eight with failing scores (below 86); a score of 86
or higher "indicates that the ship is providing an accepted standard
of sanitation."</TE>
<TE>   You also can find out why a ship failed by clicking to the
inspection report. If the ship posted its corrective action, you'll
find that too. For instance, Holland America's Noordam scored 82.
Among the infractions: There was no sign posted at the spa warning
those with health problems to avoid it, and raw chicken was stored in
a refrigerator on top of raw beef flank steaks. In its corrective
action report, the line noted that a spa sign had been ordered and
that staff members had been retrained in food storage.</TE>
<TE>   If significant illness strikes the ship's passengers, the
sanitation program is set up to alert the CDC. Twenty-four hours
before a ship arrives at a U.S. port, it reports the number of
passengers and crew who have sought medical attention for diarrhea,
Forney says. If more people seek medical help after that first report
but before the ship's arrival, another report is filed four hours
before docking. Infectious diseases such as measles or tuberculosis
are also reported, and a special report can be sent any time if the
situation warrants, he says.</TE>
<TE>   If the illness rate exceeds 2% of the ship's population, the CDC
is alerted and the situation is considered a potential outbreak,
Forney says. The CDC contacts ship officials, and a plan of action is
formulated. (Sometimes clusters of passengers become ill because of
food they ate in port, not on the ship.) When the illness rate hits
3%, "we would almost in all cases send in a team," Forney says.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers should maintain perspective when searching for a
sanitary ship. "The reality of it is, when we do an inspection, it is
a point in time," Forney says. "We could be on a ship today, and it
would pass. But tomorrow they set sail, and there is an outbreak. If
you look at the scores over time, it will give you an indication of
how the ship is maintained. If you go to the list and look up a ship,
look at the previous three, four or five inspections. If they are all
in the 96, 97, 98 range, that's pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Besides relying on the government program and checking ship
scores, consumers can take other measures to minimize disease and
sickness afloat. "At buffets, make sure the hot food is kept hot and
the cold, cold," Forney says. "If food is obviously at the wrong
temperature, alert the staff."</TE>
<TE>   Food on a buffet table, including bread, must be shielded behind a
sneeze guard or must be individually packaged.</TE>
<TE>   Besides cleanliness, many cruise passengers want a smoke-free
environment. When booking, ask which parts of the ship are
smoke-free, suggests a spokeswoman for the Cruise Lines International
Assn. Reservations agents usually can tell you at least basic
information about the ship's smoking policy. The trend is toward
smoke-free dining rooms, but travelers looking for a totally
smoke-free environment may have a hard time.</TE>
<TE>   The Carnival Paradise may be the only large cruise vessel that is
totally smoke-free. And the line is stringent about enforcing the
policy: Passengers sign a no-smoking contract, and anyone caught with
smoking materials is fined $250 and put off the ship. Since the
Paradise was launched in 1998, about four people per month have been
removed for this reason, says cruise line spokesman Vance Gulliksen.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers hoping to cruise in Europe--say, on a river cruise or
barge--have a tougher time avoiding cigarette smoke, travel industry
experts say, because smoking is still more accepted overseas. Linda
Prosk, an agent with Travel Syndicate in Woodland Hills, advises
smoke-sensitive travelers to take a cabin with a balcony so they can
get fresh air.</TE>
<TE>   Once on board, if smoke from other passengers bothers you, speak
with the cruise director or other appropriate staff members to
resolve the problem.</TE>

<HD>Country Walks, Books in Wales' Wye Valley</HD>

<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Wye Valley in Wales has long beckoned travelers with books.
Bibliophiles make a beeline for the village of Hay-on-Wye, where more
than two dozen shops offer hundreds of thousands of used books, many
old, rare or otherwise collectible.</LD>
<LD>   Although books may have put Hay-on-Wye on the map, the appeal for
me during a visit in October was the area's lovely montage of hill
and dale, woods and fields, and castle ruins and drowsy villages near
the English border.</LD>
<LD>   On the advice of a fellow hiker and book lover, I sampled the Wye
Valley Walk and Offa's Dyke Path, two of Britain's best (yet
relatively unknown) long-distance trails. With judicious use of maps
and guidebooks, and by tapping the wisdom of local tourist boards and
trail organizations such as Offa's Dyke Assn., travelers can plan a
superb week or more in the Wye Valley. These groups can offer trail
suggestions, lodging options, transportation ideas and advice on
moving luggage from inn to inn.</LD>
<TE>   The Wye Valley Walk follows the Wye River Valley, crisscrossing
the border. The 112-mile route visits dramatic limestone gorges,
rolling green hills and historic market towns.</TE>
<TE>   The walk's southernmost sections lead through what the British
call ancient woodland--trees that date to the Middle Ages. Oaks are
particularly impressive, but beech, ash, poplar and sycamore also
grow on land colored by rhododendron.</TE>
<TE>   Offa's Dyke Path offers not only a walk through history but a walk
on top of it as well. Ruthless King Offa of Mercia (now the English
Midlands) ordered his 8th century subjects to construct a long
barrier to keep out the Welsh. About 80 miles of ditches and raised
banks remain, and the border is still roughly defined by the dike.</TE>
<TE>   For most of its length the path sticks to the dike, although
occasional detours cross the quiet Wye Valley and lead onto higher
ground that affords grand views. Hikers usually allow about 12 days
to walk the entire 177-mile path.</TE>
<TE>   The Wye Valley Walk and Offa's Dyke Path are best walked south to
north so the sun and wind are at your back most of the time. A
leaping-salmon logo guides hikers on the Wye Valley Walk; Offa's Dyke
Path is marked with acorns.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring, the Wye Valley blossoms with Queen Anne's lace,
campion, hedge parsley, bluebells and daffodils. Summer days are warm
but rarely hot; in the fall, temperatures are mild, and the woods
display a bit of autumn color.</TE>
<TE>   The locally published "Wye Valley Walk Official Route Guide" is
printed on plastic--a hint that hikers should be prepared for rain in
any season. Other local trail maps often show an icon of a
clothespin, which represents facilities for drying wet clothes and
boots.</TE>
<TE>   When it's not raining, you may see peregrine falcons, buzzards and
rare red kites fly across the valley; kingfishers, swans and ducks
congregate by the river, as do minks and otters.</TE>
<TE>   The most memorable sights are the castles. When you approach these
hilltop fortresses on foot, you can better appreciate their military
intent and strategic location. Chepstow Castle, perched above the
River Wye at the start of the Wye Valley Walk, was started just after
William the Conquerer's victory at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and
was Britain's first stone stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers walking a pilgrim's path to Tintern Abbey, the
best-preserved medieval monastery in Wales, may find that its grace
and beauty leave them at a loss for words. The abbey was founded by
Cistercian monks in 1131, and its great walls, soaring archways and
vast windows are outstanding examples of Gothic architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Such sights prove there's certainly more to see in this valley
than the bookstores of Hay-on-Wye. Travelers seeking an enchanted
walk in Wales would do well to heed the words of a Tintern Abbey monk
who wrote, "You will find among the woods something you never found
in books."</TE>

<HD>Some Changes Are Afoot in Frequent-Flier Land</HD>
<DH>Elimination of blackout dates, higher mileage minimums are
just two of the tweaks being imposed by some of the airlines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you are a business traveler enrolled in one or more elite airline
clubs, you probably check your frequent-flier miles often.</LD>
<LD>   But this column is for the rest of us, the leisure travelers who
occasionally dip our toes into the arcane waters of awards, rewards
and other mileage minutiae. It's time to take the plunge because the
mileage rules are changing. Booking that free trip now instead of
later could be one of the smarter travel decisions you make this
spring.</LD>
<LD>   A roundup of recent changes in the frequent-flier world:</LD>
<TE>   * Higher mileage minimums: Some airlines are getting rid of
off-peak award levels, which typically allow travelers to book free
flights for fewer miles between September and May. Instead of using
20,000 miles to book a domestic trip in that period, for instance,
you'll need 25,000 miles, the same as in peak travel periods. At
Continental and Northwest, you have until June 1 to book under the
current, more generous rules.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska Airlines is revising its unique "bonus" miles program that
adds miles to your account when you reach various thresholds within a
calendar year. You now get 10,000 bonus miles when you reach 35,000
miles, then 10,000 more at 10,000-mile increments. But as of April 30
you will have to rack up 75,000 miles in one year to receive any
bonus miles. (You'll get 50,000.) Also starting that day, a
round-trip upgrade from coach to first class will cost 10,000 miles,
not 5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Booking online can boost miles. Among current offers: For travel
through May 31, America West offers 3,000 extra miles for every round
trip bought at www.americawest.com. For travel through March 20,
Delta knocks 5,000 miles off award minimums for domestic tickets
confirmed at www.delta.com/awardticket. In January, Southwest
announced it would extend its program of double credit for online
bookings at www.southwest.com through Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   * Buying miles with cash: Need a few more miles to get a ticket?
Buying them is an option that has been around for a while, but "in
the last half of last year ... everyone got into mileage sales," says
Randy Petersen, publisher of Inside Flyer magazine</TE>
<TE>   When should you use this option? Typically, the airlines charge
about 2.5 cents per mile, but add-ons such as service fees of $15 to
$25 plus 7.5% federal tax may boost the actual price to more than 3
cents per mile.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the miles they sell are prohibitively expensive," says
Petersen, who estimates the airlines' cost at less than a penny per
mile. But he says it may be worth it for a leisure traveler who is a
few thousand miles short of qualifying for a free domestic ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Say you have 22,000 miles but need 25,000 for a domestic ticket.
At 3 cents per mile, you pay $90 for 3,000 miles to top off your
account and get to use the free ticket. But if you need to buy 15,000
miles, you'll pay $450--more than many round-trip domestic fares.</TE>
<TE>   A little-known way to top off miles is to go into debt on your
frequent-flier account, which some airlines let you do if you're a
very frequent flier or if you use the airline's credit card
regularly, Petersen says.</TE>
<TE>   Among recent converts to mileage sales are American, which last
month extended its program through July 31; US Airways, which began
the program last month for a limited time (it has expired for
domestic tickets but is still open for transatlantic, Mexican and
Caribbean travel); and America West, which started it in November.
Northwest plans to add a program this year. In many cases you can buy
miles to give as a gift.</TE>
<TE>   * More ways to earn awards: There are, of course, thousands of
ways to get miles without ever stepping on a plane, using
airline-allied credit cards or doing business with hotels and other
airline partners--far more than could be listed in this column. Here
are some deals that expire soon:</TE>
<TE>   Until March 31 Continental frequent fliers can earn double points
on KLM flights. Through March 20, Delta frequent fliers can earn
double miles on selected flights and classes. Through May 31,
Northwest frequent fliers can earn 2,000 miles by checking in for
flights online or at airport kiosks; through April 30, first-time
buyers earn 2,500 miles for booking online at www.nwa.com. For travel
through April 28, US Airways offers 5,000 to 30,000 bonus miles for
trips between the U.S. and Europe, depending on the class and
frequency of travel.</TE>
<TE>   A quirky but timely option: You can earn miles through some
carriers while paying income taxes. Delta, for instance, awards two
miles for every dollar you pay Uncle Sam through its SkyMiles credit
card from American Express. America West gives you 500 to 2,000 miles
for using H&amp;R Block tax services for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   * A less taxing idea: More good news for frequent fliers came last
month when the IRS clarified its policy on miles earned on business
travel. It said such miles would not be taxed as income when they are
converted to personal use. Some legal experts had viewed these miles
as compensation that should be taxed, but the IRS indicated it is too
difficult to place a value on miles or to separate personal from
business accounts.</TE>
<TE>   * The end of blackouts: Northwest in January announced it was
eliminating blackout dates, the practice of barring award travel
during certain holiday periods in the U.S. and on transatlantic
travel on summer weekends. Some other airlines copied the move. But
the benefit to travelers is less than it might appear.</TE>
<TE>   As competitors note, eliminating the blackout label without
actually making more seats available for award travel on those dates
doesn't help frequent fliers get more flights. Petersen estimates
major airlines set aside an average of 10% of their seats for award
travel, but it varies widely by route and season. Not being able to
book award travel remains a persistent complaint of frequent fliers.
And often only a handful of dates are officially blacked out in the
U.S. Alaska Airlines, for instance, had 13 last year, 11 this year
and only eight planned for 2003, says spokesman Jack Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer mailings: If you haven't heard from your frequent-flier
program in a while, this may be the reason: Some airlines have cut
back on mailings and instead post updates on their Internet sites or
via e-mail. "If you haven't decided to be an electronic junkie,
you're almost never going to hear about the offers out there,"
Petersen says. Besides signing up on the airlines' sites, it's
worthwhile to surf www.webflyer.com, www.smarterliving.com and other
services that regularly scan and post the latest frequent-flier
offers. A savvy travel agent should be on top of these offers too.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In her article "Travel Agents Cry Foul Over Internet Fare Deals"
(Travel Insider, Feb. 17), Jane Engle raises an important issue: Are
Internet fares fair to consumers?</LD>
<LD>   The answer is yes. Suggesting that Internet fares aren't fair
overlooks a basic economic fact: It simply costs the airlines less to
sell tickets online. Orbitz, for example, enables airlines to reduce
the cost of the middleman and pass the savings on to consumers in the
form of discounted Web fares. In this case, the middlemen are the
computer reservations systems that traditional travel agents use but
that add $12 to $15 to the cost of an air ticket, besides the
commission charged by the agent.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers know that buying direct saves them money, and they have
proved more than willing to shop around to take advantage of those
savings. That's certainly the case with Internet fares, which provide
discounts of up to 75% off other available fares.</LD>
<TE>   More important, the U.S. Department of Transportation has agreed
that when airlines sell certain fares only by the Internet or other
channels, it promotes competition to the benefit of travelers. The
DOT ruled in October 2000 that if airlines were required to make
Internet fares available to offline travel agents, which add
commission and computer reservations system costs, fares would
increase. And that would be bad for consumers.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "In the Red Amtrak has no Deficit of Devotees" (Travel
Insider, March 3): I travel 20,000 to 30,000 miles a year on Amtrak
and enjoy the passengers, scenery and food. On one of my trips in the
last two years I traveled to Los Angeles, then on to Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the main reasons Amtrak carries only 1% of the traveling
public is that it has never had: the proper funding for equipment to
meet the demand; adequate promotion; incentives for the freight
railroads to keep Amtrak on time; or investment incentives. The
federal government provides 80% of highway funding, with 20% match
from the states. Rail receives no such match in investment.</LD>
<LD>   A survey by Marist College Institute for Public Opinion showed
that 97% of New York voters think intercity passenger train service
should be improved and modernized, not eliminated; 82% believe that
having improved and modernized intercity passenger train service is
at least as important as having good highways and airports. Other
surveys around the country show big support for passenger rail.</LD>

<CP>PHOTO: Mary Best calls this photo her "Sunset Steer," a bull
silhouetted in the dusk of El Chapulin in Baja California, Mexico, an
hour southeast of La Paz on the Gulf of California. Best was visiting
the region last year with her husband, George Howell, when she saw
the animals roaming near a coastal ridge. "They were moving from the
beach back toward the desert, and I didn't want this one to go over
the ridge and disappear," says Best, of Mt. Rainier, Md. What to do?
Follow the bull, of course. Despite her husband's objections ("You're
on your own," he said), she called out to this steer for about 10
minutes--long enough to slow its retreat and snap this picture.</CP>

<DL>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam</DL>
<LD>This was going to be fun! Up and down Le Duan Street, where the U.S.
Embassy once stood, laughing teenagers in denim and silk were racing
their motorbikes, eating ice cream and smiling and waving at the
American strolling toward Notre Dame Cathedral.</LD>
<LD>   Then I met my Dien Bien Phu. I could not cross the street. There
was no traffic signal, no policeman and no order whatever. The sea of
motorbikes never parted.</LD>
<LD>   "Ride, sir?" asked a cyclo, or pedicab, driver named Thien. "Yes,"
I said.</LD>
<TE>   I was in Ho Chi Minh City, by myself, after my wife and I had a
disagreement about where to travel after the events of Sept. 11. She
had said no way, nowhere--go by yourself. So I thought I would come
to a land with which I had long been fascinated, a land of pagodas,
Buddhist monks, prayer wheels and rice paddies. Thus, in January, I
ended up in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   The scene of the 20th century's longest war is today an oasis of
peace. Over eight days I found everything I was seeking: serene
temples, jasmine and incense, straw conical hats, hushed children
sitting cross-legged in the streets and painting in oils. I also
found incredibly low prices.</TE>
<TE>   With amazing ease, Thien pedaled me down Dong Khoi Street past art
galleries and young women in orchid-and-white tunics selling roses. I
knew Dong Khoi well--from novels and newsreels--though I was new
here. It had been Tu Do Street during the Vietnam War and Rue Catinat
under the French, who ruled here from 1859 until their rout by Gen.
Ho Chi Minh at Dien Bien Phu in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Thien dropped me off at a French cafe called Brodard, charging me
about $3.30. I asked an Englishman at the next table how he dealt
with the traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "Just step off the curb and walk right into it," Nick said. "Don't
stop or slow down or speed up or make a run for it. You'll get the
rhythm of it. Just remind yourself: They're only these bloody little
bikes."</TE>
<TE>   Brodard resembled an ice cream parlor in a small Provencal town,
with ceiling fans and sepia paintings on caramel-colored walls. It
was comforting and soothing, and it gave me the strength to grapple
with Ho Chi Minh City again.</TE>
<TE>   I came to Nguyen Hue Boulevard, a broad thoroughfare designed by
the French, and froze. There were motorbikes as far as my eyes could
see. I remembered what Nick had told me, but I just could not get off
the curb. Then a girl, maybe 6 years old, stepped out smartly beside
me, and I walked in her shadow to the other side.</TE>
<TE>   I ducked into the marble-floored lobby of the Rex Hotel. Here,
during the Vietnam War, the U.S. military briefed correspondents on
the battles of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Rooms at the upscale Rex were going for $49. At Ho Chi Minh City's
six five-star hotels, prices started at $80. Although I was traveling
on a package in which individual costs were not broken down, I
figured I was paying about $95 for a huge, bright room at the
luxurious Sofitel Plaza, including a buffet breakfast with
Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese and American food.</TE>
<TE>   The Rex's lobby was filled with Americans. While American visitors
see Vietnam as a historic battleground, half of Vietnam's 78.5
million people are under 20 years old, and for them the war is not
even a memory. Over my five days here, older Vietnamese rarely made
eye contact with me, but younger people smiled and often initiated
conversations.</TE>
<TE>   Americans have been visiting Vietnam in growing numbers since
1994, when the U.S. lifted the trade embargo that had been in place
since 1975. Vietnam's Communist government still forbids opposition
parties but now allows much private enterprise and encourages foreign
investment. I myself was staying in a French hotel and traveling on a
Chinese tour package.</TE>
<TE>   My Cathay Pacific holiday included a city tour with a guide. Pham
Anh Ngoc was of college age, bubbly and giddy, and her tour on my
second day in the city began this way: "Would you believe it? Long
ago there were two Vietnams, a north and a south."</TE>
<TE>   Ngoc--her first name--told me I didn't have to keep saying "Ho Chi
Minh City" because everyone else still calls it Saigon. She took me
to the War Remnants Museum, which is four galleries of photos and
exhibits on what the Vietnamese call the "American War." The photos
were graphic and gruesome, showing massacres, beheadings, tortures
and deformed babies. The museum was packed, and nearly all the
visitors were American.</TE>
<TE>   When I was finished, I found Ngoc under a tree. "So how did you
feel about it?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little unbalanced," I said. "There was nothing about
what the North Vietnamese did to the South Vietnamese. And some of
the captions were false. But how do you feel about it?"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I've never gone inside," Ngoc said. "It's just for tourists."</TE>
<TE>   After the tour, I got up the nerve to walk the four blocks from
the Sofitel Plaza to Notre Dame Cathedral. The last street was the
hardest, but I followed Nick's advice and made it across.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the cathedral, a woman carrying a basket filled with
postcards and guidebooks pushed a thick book of Vietnamese postage
stamps on me. For $7 it was a good deal, and I bought it. In seconds,
every vendor on the plaza was on me, so I ran into a guarded orange
brick building. It was the Central Post Office, designed in the late
1880s by French engineer Gustav Eiffel, a cavernous vault with 11
interior arches and, at the back, a painting of Ho Chi Minh. Ho was
president of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from 1946 to 1954,
and then, after the partition into two Vietnams, of North Vietnam
until his death in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve long lacquered wood benches near the entrance were filled
with people writing letters in longhand. Some used fountain pens.
When they finished, they went to one of 37 windows, each labeled in
Vietnamese and English. Although there were easily 200 customers in
the post office, there were no lines.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the driver of a motorbike taxi, or honda om, offered to
take me to Pham Ngu Lao, the budget hotel district where many
backpacking visitors stay, for $2. Chung told me to sit on the back
of his bike, holding onto his waist, and I began the most
hair-raising ride of my life. We were inches away from the thousands
of other motorbikes, weaving around trucks and buses and leaning over
a bit too far whenever Chung took a curve. But after a while I
started to like it.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the 20th century, Saigonese traveled on bicycles. But
in 1986, Vietnam's Communist rulers evolved a plan called doi moi,
"renovation," to raise living standards and improve the economy.
Under the plan, motorbikes became affordable. While $500 is more than
a year's pay in much of Vietnam, it's only five months' earnings in
thriving Saigon, a city of about 7 million.</TE>
<TE>   He dropped me off in front of the 333 Cafe, a long, narrow
restaurant open to the street, across the road from an Internet cafe
and next to a restaurant called Good Morning, Vietnam. In front,
signs in English advertised pizza, hamburgers, Vietnamese food,
vegetarian food, pastas and sandwiches. All the tables were taken but
the front one, the one I wanted, and I ordered a bottle of water for
50 cents.</TE>
<TE>   I soon learned why no one had taken the front table. Street
hustlers offered me calculators that shot flames and dozens of other
fine collectors' items. Boys tried to shine my running shoes.</TE>
<TE>   But the view of sidewalk life was worth the annoyance. A woman
wearing fuchsia silk pajamas buffed the toenails of another whose
teeth and lips had turned dark red from chewing betel nuts. A bicycle
repairman found leaks in tires. Two high school girls in white silk
ao dai--the national costume of tunic and matching pants--lifted
their trouser legs as they walked through a puddle. A scribe battered
out letters on a vintage typewriter. A pretty young woman wrapped
mounds of sticky rice in banana leaves and handed them to a mother
and a girl in a dirty dress. Two wrinkled women wearing conical straw
hats carried a baby to a doorway and rubbed ointment on his red
bottom. Coconut sellers balanced trays on bamboo rods.</TE>
<TE>   I left to check out the dinner clubs on Dong Khoi, the Fun Zone,
which runs from Notre Dame to the Saigon River. Maybe I could even
find something authentically Vietnamese in this cosmopolitan city.
Through the windows I saw an all-Vietnamese crowd at Paloma Cafe, so
I took a seat at the dark walnut bar.</TE>
<TE>   Paloma was decorated like a Spanish grotto, dark with strings of
gold doubloons hanging from the walls. At one end of the room, an
alto in a green ao dai sang sweet-sounding Vietnamese songs, and at
the other, Elmer Fudd cartoons were showing on a big-screen TV.</TE>
<TE>   From a menu that included beef stroganoff and tournedos in
bearnaise sauce, I ordered grilled sea bass en croute with lemon
butter sauce for $3. It turned out to be stunning, one of four great
meals I had in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Enjoying the show, I listened as a violinist played "Roll Out the
Barrel." I loved the sweet and dated innocence of Paloma, the boys
bouncing on their father's knees, skinny teenagers in bobby socks.</TE>
<TE>   The following afternoon I took an air-conditioned taxi to the
Saigon River. Taxis cost 65 cents for the first kilometer and were
super-clean. Drivers always used their meters and never claimed to be
out of change.</TE>
<TE>   I was now down to five main streets that I couldn't cross, and the
highway along the river, called Ton Duc Thang, was one of them. I
took one look at the traffic on Ton Duc Thang and ducked into the
Lobby Lounge at the Renaissance Riverside, another of Saigon's top
hotels. A waitress wearing a light green ao dai brought me a Georges
Duboeuf Chardonnay for $3, and bowls of cashews and crisp dried peas.
I relaxed in a wicker chair, looking past the table of gleeful
American men smoking Cuban cigars, and out the huge windows
overlooking my dreaded Ton Duc Thang.</TE>
<TE>   When I got up the courage to cross the street, I left. But the
traffic defeated me again. A cyclo driver offered to take me across
Ton Duc Thang to the river for 50 cents. He edged into traffic, made
a U-turn after a few blocks, tried to sell me a massage, a watch and
a radio, then deposited me on the riverbank.</TE>
<TE>   That evening I added Le Loi, site of the Municipal Theater, to the
list of streets I could cross without the aid of a child, as I walked
to Augustin, a French restaurant. Its 11 tables were brightly
spotlighted. On the wall were posters from the Cezanne museum in
Aix-en-Provence, France, along with faux Renoirs whose Parisian
picnickers looked Vietnamese. The sweet smells of olive oil and
freshly baked bread filled the air. From a long list of classic
French main dishes, I picked the canard a l'orange, since duck is a
Vietnamese specialty. It was served with carrots and cauliflower, all
wonderful. In time I got a bill for $14.</TE>
<TE>   When I arrived at the nightclub Apocalypse Now, four blocks east,
the Rolling Stones were singing "Brown Sugar" and Manchester United
was playing Liverpool on one giant screen, and Britney Spears was on
another. Ngoc, my guide, had told me her parents did not allow her to
go to Apocalypse Now because it was no place for nice girls. A bad
girl wearing a crimson top and a short black skirt told me the
dancing would begin in two hours, at midnight.</TE>
<TE>   I walked two blocks toward the Saigon River and crossed Ton Duc
Thang--twice.</TE>

<HD>On Virginia's Antiques Trail</HD>
<DH>Hunting for treasures in shops both dusty and chic on a
route that's steeped in history.</DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL>MIDDLEBURG, Va.</DL>
<LD>They are the kinds of tales that tease out the fortune seeker in all
of us.</LD>
<LD>   There's the one about the $40,000 Stickley music stand cloaked in
neglect and nabbed for $500, and the $1,100 Steuben Arts and Crafts
bowl with a $3 price tag.</LD>
<LD>   But antiquing here in Northern Virginia's fox-hunting country is
like the sport itself. It's mostly about the thrill of the chase and
the spectacular ride through gorgeous countryside. It turns out that
the gold-mine find is as elusive as the crafty little fox.</LD>
<TE>   That doesn't mean you'll go home empty-handed. I've been
successfully trolling hunt-country antiques shops for the last decade
on my own and with an antiques dealer who knows the obscure places
where treasures might lurk. Although my house is crammed with
interesting and odd pieces, I've yet to find a hidden gem I can buy
for a song.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's been a great ride. And you won't find prettier country
for your quest. This is a place where four-board fences and intricate
stone walls edge manicured green fields; where the soft peaks of the
Blue Ridge Mountains define the horizon; where the lazy Shenandoah
River flows.</TE>
<TE>   The countryside is peppered with grand country estates with
palatial barns, and the picturesque towns have more antiques shops
than churches. There are hundreds of them within 75 miles of
Washington, but the area around Middleburg, about an hour west of the
capital, has the best combination of landscape and antiquescape.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in Middleburg, I made a weekend loop in December with my
companion, John Muncie, through the part of Northern Virginia tucked
up between West Virginia and Maryland, revisiting favorite antiques
shops and finding new ones.</TE>
<TE>   We saw it at its dowdiest, when all the trees were bare and the
fields tinged beige. In early spring, Northern Virginia begins to put
on its party clothes. Jaunty daffodils brighten a landscape that's
popping with new green everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Middleburg is a historic village of 600. It's small, walkable and
so quaint it looks like a Hollywood set, which it has been. When TV's
"The West Wing" needed a picturesque New Hampshire town to film, it
took its cameras to Middleburg, which is lined with old stone
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Middleburg was established in 1787 by Leven Powell, a colonel in
the Revolutionary War. Powell named it Middleburg because it was
midway along the Ashby Gap trading route (now U.S. Route 50) between
the cities of Alexandria on the Potomac River and Winchester at the
foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Among some of Middleburg's 160 buildings listed on historic
registries are numerous, mostly up-scale antiques shops where prices
often hover in the four- to five-figure range. For example, Skandina,
which specializes in big, blond Scandinavian pieces, is crammed with
large wardrobes, sideboards and armoires ranging from $1,975 (an 1860
Danish armoire) to $6,900 (an 1840 yellow Swedish secretary).</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner on Main Street, Hastening Antiques has two
stores a block apart. They're the kind of hushed places with
carefully printed cards for each item. Hastening specializes in 17th
and 18th century European furniture and you-must-be-kidding prices.
When we were there, an 1840 French provincial extended walnut dining
table with four leaves was going for $23,000 and a 1710 George I red
pine sideboard for $12,500.</TE>
<TE>   Just three blocks away is the far less pretentious and far more
fun Powder Horn Gunshop.</TE>
<TE>   For the past 26 years, owner Bob Daly has filled the Powder Horn
with antique firearms and accouterments of war. Even if you're not a
military buff, the Powder Horn is a fascinating mini-museum of
surprising memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   Like the display of pre-Revolutionary flintlock rifles behind the
cash register. Daly took one down and held it up next to himself. It
was taller than he. (He said it was 6 feet, 1 inch long.) The rifle
dates to about 1730-40, and Daly was asking $3,500.</TE>
<TE>   Is it shootable? John asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who would fire one of these is insane," Daly replied. "It
would break the spring mechanism and blow out the bottom of the
rifle."</TE>
<TE>   It just doesn't get horsier than Middleburg, home to the
12,000-plus volumes of the equine-themed National Sporting Library,
the Chronicle of the Horse (a weekly magazine that dutifully reports
in agate a blinding number of horse show results from around the
world), three tack shops, a custom chap maker and a heavily medaled
assortment of Olympic riders and trainers. The town's yearly calendar
of events lists fox hunting, stable tours, polo matches,
steeplechases and horse shows. Pedestrians here wear britches and
boots; horse trailers crowd the roads; and the local newspaper even
has an editor just for horse sports.</TE>
<TE>   Middleburg to Upperville</TE>
<TE>   We drove west the next morning on U.S. Route 50, officially named
the John S. Mosby Highway, after the Confederate raider. We were
headed toward Upperville, about nine miles west through open rolling
hills.</TE>
<TE>   We stopped for brunch at Hunter's Head Tavern, built in 1793 by
John Carr, the founder of Upperville. It has three cozy dining rooms
and an English theme.</TE>
<TE>   The food, which ranged from bubble and squeak to portabello
burgers, is better than most of what you'll find in Middleburg.</TE>
<TE>   The English theme of Hunter's Head continues down the street at
Yesterday's Riches, housed in a building that, more than 100 years
ago, was the Upperville Town Hall. Owner Carol Sherman, who lived in
England, stocks her place with 18th and 19th century English
furniture and a bewildering assortment of wooden boxes: sewing boxes,
glove boxes, tea boxes, writing boxes. If it's an old box from
England, she has it. Prices ranged from $385 for an 1860 rosewood
glove box with satinwood inlay to $850 for an 1870 walnut tea caddy
with mother-of-pearl inlay.</TE>
<TE>   Upperville to Paris</TE>
<TE>   Our next stop was Paris, just three miles west on Route 50.
Founded in 1786, Paris is a handful of restored buildings nestled in
a postcard-pretty setting that bumps up against the foothills of the
Blue Ridge Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   We visited the town's new American in Paris antiques shop, which
I'd never been to. This two-story building sits on the site of what
was once Ashby's Tavern, first visited by George Washington in 1759.</TE>
<TE>   The shop occupies two snug rooms downstairs; owners Carol and Gary
Konkel live above. American in Paris features mostly American pieces
from the late 18th and early 19th centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Hanging on one wall were 150-year-old kitchen implements,
including an iron strainer for $125 and a copper ladle for $75. On
another wall hung a 1920s child's wicker chair from Maine ($320)
above a green child's twig chair ($95).</TE>
<TE>   Nearby was an 1830 needlepoint Empire stool for $550 and an 1840
mahogany Empire chest from Baltimore priced at $3,900.</TE>
<TE>   Paris is known for the gracious Ashby Inn. Begun as a residence in
1829, the inn and its adjunct "School House" have 10 guest rooms,
lovely gardens, a respected restaurant and a deserved national
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   For this trip, though, we stayed at the Red Fox Inn and Tavern in
downtown Middleburg. Established in 1728, the Red Fox bills itself as
the "oldest original inn in America." It's steeped in history and
looks the part--original fieldstone facade, worn wood floors, low
ceilings, fireplaces--but the main building is noisy and a bit
rundown. The rooms needed updating. Upholstery was threadbare, paint
was chipped, the bathrooms were gloomy and some of the furnishings
looked as if they had come from a thrift store. Dinner was a little
better than routine, but there was no buffet breakfast as promised.
After we reminded the hostess, she brought us a couple of stale
Danish.</TE>
<TE>   The Ashby Inn is a better bet. The rooms, appointed with antiques,
look like something out of a magazine. The walls are painted in deep,
rich reds, yellows and browns (it works), and the planked floors are
painted with colorful diamonds. I've eaten at the inn's restaurant
numerous times, and it's been consistently terrific.</TE>
<TE>   Paris to Millwood</TE>
<TE>   From Paris we continued west on Route 50 down through the
1,100-foot Ashby Gap and across the Shenandoah River, its banks
flanked by stands of white-barked sycamores looking like ghost trees
against the stark winter landscape. We turned north on Virginia Route
723 to the village of Millwood.</TE>
<TE>   The town is accented with Victorian homes, white churches and, of
course, antiques shops. The most impressive of these is Red
Schoolhouse Antiques, which occupies a cavernous 10-room building
that was most recently a private school.</TE>
<TE>   Red Schoolhouse features half a dozen dealers specializing in
antiques from the U.S. and the British Isles. A butcher-block table
on the front brick steps carried a tag that said "wonderful old
butcher block table, $698."</TE>
<TE>   John asked Priscilla Miller, the dealer on duty, how old it was,
and she said, "You have to look it over carefully and come to your
own conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't as cagey as it sounds. Age, origin and method of
manufacture are not always certain when you're treasure hunting. Ask
questions; be skeptical. One thing is fairly certain, however: Most
antiques dealers are willing to come down at least 10% on price. But
don't stop there, and never pay what's on the tag. (Just be careful
not to offend with an offer that's too low.)</TE>
<TE>   Red Schoolhouse has a large selection of furniture and
accessories. I was particularly taken with an 1890 child's horse,
with original paint, for $165; an 1840 French chestnut armoire from
Brittany, with original hardware, for $3,895; and a gym-size room
full of farm tables.</TE>
<TE>   Millwood to Boyce</TE>
<TE>   Our next stop was just three miles up Route 723. Boyce is not as
much a town as a small collection of nondescript buildings. Among
them is another new find for me: the General Store Antiques at Boyce,
whose interior is anything but nondescript.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the General Store's charm comes from owner Emile Borel. A
tall, exuberant Frenchman with a small gray ponytail and a quick
smile, Borel, 70, speaks with an accent as thick as goose pate. Every
fifth word is French. When I asked him whether a set of wooden garden
tools was old, he answered, "Ooh la, la! Of course!"</TE>
<TE>   The General Store, which opened in November, features a potpourri
of antiques: furniture, toys, tools, commercial culinary and wine
equipment, knickknacks. A child's wooden rocking horse was selling
for $295; an 1890 butcher's table for $5,400; a charcuterie sign for
$800; a 1930 Paya red race car for $2,350.</TE>
<TE>   Most everything is from southern France. As it says on the
business card, "Un Petit Air de Provence"--a little breath of
Provence. As Borel walked us around telling stories about every item,
French sidewalk music played in the background.</TE>
<TE>   Boyce to Purcellville</TE>
<TE>   The next stop was Purcellville, a town of pre-Revolutionary
history and Victorian homes. In 1874 a railroad line connected
Purcellville and Washington, D.C. But in 1968 the trains stopped
running (the rail bed is now a 45-mile linear park), and until
recently the town kept its remote, country flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Purcellville is barely hanging onto its charm. The area has boomed
in recent years, and D.C. sprawl has brought fast-food outlets and
cookie-cutter developments.</TE>
<TE>   The town has several antiques shops, including half a dozen within
a block of the central crossroads of Virginia routes 690 and 7, which
is called "The Colonial Highway" for its historic antecedents.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the shops house a mishmash of furniture, china, dolls and
colored glass bottles of dubious antiquity. Rich Bottom Antiques
offers an upscale and high-dollar collection of 18th and 19th century
American furniture and accessories. An 1810 painted pine cupboard was
selling for $7,450; a New England painted pine chest from 1800 for
$985; an 1890 hardware store sign for $1,250.</TE>
<TE>   When we stopped by, it had been open only six months, but owner
Art Richmond, a commercial property developer by trade, said he had
been collecting all his life. His Rich Bottom farm is crammed with
antiques, including 39 clocks made before 1840, all in working order.</TE>
<TE>   Purcellville to Hamilton</TE>
<TE>   By the time we left Rich Bottom it was nearly 5 p.m., so we
hustled east on Route 7 to the village of Hamilton, our last stop of
the day.</TE>
<TE>   Our main goal was John Ware Jr.'s Hamilton Antiques Inc. Ware's
original place was about 10 miles away at Hillsboro (where his
parents live and where he still has a workshop), but last fall he
moved to this former 1930 car shop, and we wanted to see what his new
place looked like.</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon Ware's inventory included his usual assortment of
handsome Mission and Arts and Crafts pieces he has restored. This is
the kind of furniture that has good bones. A Gustav Stickley H-back
rocker was selling for $900, a cottage washstand from the 1880s for
$165.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the show is Ware himself. He loves to talk about the ups
and downs and ins and outs of the antique treasure hunt, and he has
plenty of stories to tell. Like the one about the Steuben Arts and
Crafts bowl.</TE>
<TE>   He saw it in a cluttered antiques store. He thought the tag said
$300. Ware knew the piece was worth at least $1,100, and he was more
than willing to pay the asking price, but because antiquing is as
much about bargaining as buying, he asked the store owner if she
couldn't do better. "Sir," the woman said, "it's only $3. I can't do
much better than that."</TE>
<TE>   When I laughed at the punch line, it was without regret. Chances
are I'll never find a deal like that, but I've already found my
treasure just by traveling around the countryside and being on the
hunt.</TE>

<DH>Strange happenings during the making of a 'Firestarter'
sequel add to its aura. The movie airs on Sci Fi Channel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one will actually say that the set of the new Sci Fi Channel movie
"Firestarter: Rekindled" was cursed. But the star and executive
producer admit a lot of strange and unexplained things happened
during production in Salt Lake City on the sequel to the Stephen King
horror classic.</LD>
<LD>   "Everything that could possible go wrong went wrong on this
movie," says executive producer Tom Thayer. "A bizarre set of
circumstances during production forced us to bring in somebody at one
point to 'cleanse' the set. You are used to things going wrong during
a production, but these were strange, off the wall."</LD>
<LD>   The first day on the set, says star Marguerite Moreau, her mother
suffered a brain aneurysm and nearly died. "She is fine now," says
Moreau. "But that is how we started. The next day, part of the crew
who were busy exploding things almost died. The fire would start at
certain times, and then it wouldn't. We had problems with sets and
crews--whole crews leaving and designers leaving."</LD>
<TE>   The local psychic, says Moreau, not only "cleansed" the set but
also gave it her blessing. So did the psychic's visit stop the
mayhem?</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on who you talk to," says Thayer. "I kept saying
during production ... they are going to capture Osama bin Laden the
night this picture is going to air!"</TE>
<TE>   "Firestarter: Rekindled," which can be seen Sunday and Monday on
the cable network, is set 10 years after the conclusion of King's
original story. Charlie McGee (Moreau) has spent her young life on
the run.</TE>
<TE>   Both cursed and blessed with a pyrokinetic ability, Charlie is
known as a "firestarter" and wanted by the government agency that
created her--especially the psychotic scientist John Rainbird
(Malcolm McDowell). Rainbird has become obsessed with her and is
determined to gain control of her powers, having spent the last
decade perfecting the drug that gave Charlie her abilities. During
those years, he has also cultivated a dangerous array of young boys,
each with a different psychic ability.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Nucci plays a researcher who unwittingly leads Rainbird to
Charlie, while Dennis Hopper is a half-mad professor named Richardson
who was one of Rainbird's first test subjects.</TE>
<TE>   McDowell ("A Clockwork Orange," "If") welcomed playing such a
complex character. "He is not just a sociopath," he says. "I found it
very interesting, this sort of 'Beauty and the Beast' kind of
thing--the fact that he created her and was in love with her. It gave
me a place to go."</TE>
<TE>   Originally, there wasn't a scene between Rainbird and Richardson,
but when Hopper was cast, writer Philip Eisner quickly wrote a
sequence in which Rainbird tortures him. "That was one of the great
days for me to work on that project," says McDowell.</TE>
<TE>   "I have known [Hopper] since '69, when I first met him," McDowell
says. "He was doing 'Easy Rider' and I was doing 'If.' We were both
at the Cannes Film Festival together.... I hung out with him and Jack
[Nicholson] and Peter Fonda."</TE>
<TE>   King, says Thayer, has no involvement in the movie. Universal
Studios owned the rights to the book, having turned it into a popular
movie in 1984, starring Drew Barrymore as Charlie. But Thayer says
they have kept King's agents in the loop since the project was
ordered.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been trying to sell this movie off and on for about four
or five years, in one incarnation or another," says Thayer. "I kept
saying to people, 'You can't ignore the title. You can't ignore the
concept. You can't ignore the author.'"</TE>
<TE>   If the movie is a success, Thayer and Sci Fi will transform
"Firestarter" into a weekly series. "There is a lot to examine [in a
weekly series]," he says. "There are certainly elements of 'The
Fugitive,' and you have elements of 'The Incredible Hulk.' She has
really become addicted to aspects of her alter ego. It's like a drug
to her. She detests what it does to her, but once it's turned on, she
craves it. She is loath to turn it off. To me, that's very
interesting."</TE>
<TE>   "Firestarter: Rekindled" can be seen Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m.
on the Sci Fi Channel. The network has rated it TV-14-VS (may be
unsuitable for children under 14, with special advisories for
violence and sexuality).</TE>

<HD>Bren Carefully Plans His 11,000-Acre Gift</HD>
<DH>Land: The Irvine Co. chairman wants the open space managed
just so before it goes public in a decade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After three decades of master planning Orange County housing
developments and shopping malls, Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren
and his staff are now just as meticulously designing 11,000 acres of
open space in the rugged Santa Ana mountains.</LD>
<LD>   The developer, who announced in November that he was donating the
land, will maintain control of the property for a decade, gradually
increasing public access before signing it over to a government
agency or nonprofit.</LD>
<LD>   "Having the land set aside is a good thing," said company Senior
Vice President Monica Florian. "But what really is important is how
that land is managed, the stewardship, and how the resources are
protected in the long term.... That isn't something you just do in
one day, say, 'Oh here's 11,000 acres, have a nice day.'</LD>
<TE>   "This is a very fundamental and valuable part of the Irvine Ranch
Master Plan, and we are trying to devote as much attention to the
care and designing ... on the natural side as we do on the
development side," Florian said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Sim, who retired last summer as head of the company's
commercial properties division, said he thought Bren visualized it as
a "great park, like a Central Park in New York City."</TE>
<TE>   There would be jogging, bike and horse riding trails, and other
recreational assets, combined with extensive wildlife habitat, Sim
said.</TE>
<TE>   While the land is unquestionably remarkable, with remote canyons,
rare grasslands and forests full of rare plants and animals, some
wonder how and when the public will actually get to enjoy it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's huge and stunning and beautiful," said Tom Anderson, a
retired Orange schoolteacher and avid horseback rider who leads the
Equestrian Coalition, dedicated to more riding opportunities in the
county. "Public access, that's what I want ... although I recognize
it is a paramount responsibility to protect the habitat and the flora
and the fauna."</TE>
<TE>   Other open land preserved by the Irvine Co. generally is
off-limits, with guards patrolling miles of fences strung with
no-trespassing signs.</TE>
<TE>   Hikes led by Nature Conservancy docents and mountain bike rides
are allowed in certain areas. But reservations must be made, groups
are limited to a few dozen people, excursions must stick to certain
trails, and trespassers can be cited or arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Company and conservancy officials say that will eventually change,
with a goal of "more liberal access," according to Florian. Both
groups said protecting natural resources while guaranteeing public
access was a delicate balance.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be clear that one of the key points that the Nature
Conservancy and the Irvine Co. have talked about is being able to
provide opportunities for public access," said Graham Chisholm,
director of the California Nature Conservancy office, which will be
paid $20 million to manage the lands for the next 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Some access will come within 18 months, and that gradually will be
increased, said company spokesman Rich Elbaum, as studies about the
treasure trove of rare species and environmental risks of allowing
recreational use are completed.</TE>
<TE>   Bren, who routinely stays out of the limelight on business matters
but is known for his scrupulous attention to detail, is watching the
preparations closely.</TE>
<TE>   "I think any agreement is blessed by Mr. Bren, and he's clearly
aware of the details," said Chisholm. "This is Mr. Bren's vision. I
think part of his vision is he wants this to be done to the highest
standard of successful land managers."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Nature Conservancy, the company is meeting with
a variety of community and recreational groups. But the final
decisions will rest with the company. Public hearings and government
approvals will not be required, although environmental reviews would
be needed for any nature centers or other park facilities that might
be built.</TE>
<TE>   Some agree that having the park privately designed and managed for
a number of years is a plus.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Small, a Boston-based attorney who has prepared several
hundred conservation easements, said "private stewards are more
careful ... and aren't tied up in political issues in taking care of
their land."</TE>
<TE>   Craig Atkins of O'Donnell Atkins, California's largest land
broker, said the careful design and upkeep of the open space would
also drive up values on adjacent land that Bren still plans to
develop.</TE>
<TE>   "You get premiums for being near this 11,000-acre 'Bren Park.' You
can walk, jog, enjoy the views.... He's beautified Orange County and
enhanced the value of the remaining lands," Atkins said. "It's better
to have him as the steward, as opposed to a bunch of kids scrawling
graffiti all over it. Don Bren does a great job of creating fantastic
atmosphere in his housing communities. He'll do the same thing here."</TE>
<TE>   One looming question is who will manage the lands after the Nature
Conservancy's 10-year commitment runs out. Nationally, the
organization has been bowing out of land management projects, and
Chisholm said he is not sure what will happen.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of 10 years, our hope would be they would be happy to
extend that role here," said Florian. Even if the conservancy
doesn't, she said, the goal of the company and the nonprofit was to
"help get these lands basically turnkey-ready to turn over to a
public agency owner."</TE>

<HD>New Hope on Immigrant Amnesty</HD>
<DH>Law: Thousands rejected under 1986 legislation for briefly
leaving the U.S. hope a new ruling will alter that. Critics say they
had their chance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Gloria Alcantar came to the United States 22 years ago, she
imagined the golden opportunities she had seen in the movies.
Instead, trapped in a legal battle over a 15-year-old immigration
law, she feels she never got a fair chance.</LD>
<LD>   Like hundreds of thousands of immigrants in a decades-long legal
dispute over the 1986 immigration amnesty law, Alcantar says she
could have earned more money, secured health insurance and visited
family in Mexico--if only she'd been granted a green card.</LD>
<LD>   "I would have been a different person," said the Ventura resident,
who just had surgery for lung cancer at age 40.</LD>
<TE>   "I could have developed myself as a person. I could have a future.
Now I just hope there is a way I can get residency. It would still
help."</TE>
<TE>   Alcantar is one of the thousands of plaintiffs in three lawsuits
filed after they were disqualified from applying for amnesty under
the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. The INS rejected
Alcantar's application because she indicated she had left the country
for a month to celebrate Christmas with her parents in their native
state of Guanajuato.</TE>
<TE>   Now, after years of murky legal maneuvering, a Feb. 15 court
ruling raises hope for her and others who contend that brief absences
from the U.S. should not have disqualified them for amnesty.</TE>
<TE>   "This ruling opens the door for these people," said the leading
plaintiffs' attorney in one of the class-action lawsuits, Peter A.
Schey of the Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights and
Constitutional Law.</TE>
<TE>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service's rejection of certain
applications, he added, "changed people's lives dramatically. Tons of
people lost jobs. Children could not attend college. People were
detained unnecessarily. People could not visit their families in
times of illness and death. Most of all, they were deprived of the
opportunity to become American citizens. It caused untold suffering
over the years."</TE>
<TE>   The immigration act resulted from a debate over how to treat
millions of workers who had contributed to the national economy for
decades but were in the country illegally. Those granted amnesty
gained legal residency and the ability to apply for citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Undocumented immigrants had to show they had lived continuously in
the U.S. and had left for only "brief periods." The suit, originally
filed in 1986, challenged INS implementation of the law. It
disqualified anyone who had left the country without INS permission.</TE>
<TE>   The Feb. 15 ruling, by U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton, also
allows others to join the class action if they can show their amnesty
application was rejected because they left the country briefly.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say undocumented immigrants should not be given another
chance at amnesty, especially those repeatedly entering the U.S.
without documentation.</TE>
<TE>   Schey, in a motion filed Thursday, asked the court to approve a
publicity campaign to increase the number of class-action
participants, to set an 18-month application deadline and to order
the INS to process the applications within six months. A hearing is
scheduled April 1 in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Alvaro Ramirez Hernandez, 43, of Orange said he has been haunted
by the INS rejection of more than a decade ago. He had hoped a green
card would help him get him a better job. Using a fake Social
Security card for nearly 20 years, he has earned no Social Security
benefits. His salary as a cook is $8 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Until the mid-1990s, when enforcement of the U.S. border became
stricter, he would travel to Mexico to visit his wife and two
children, who didn't want to live in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had a green card, I would have tried to bring them here, not
with a coyote [immigrant smuggler] but the right way," said Ramirez
Hernandez. "If had a green card, I would visit them. Right now, I
can't. This has kept my family divided."</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez Hernandez is now seeking residency under the Legal
Immigration and Family Equity Act Amendments of 2000, known as the
LIFE Act, which set up an alternative program for plaintiffs in one
of the lawsuits to seeking residency.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Fernandez Hernandez, 35, of Santa Ana was not a party to the
lawsuit but hopes the latest court ruling will allow her to join it.
In the late 1980s, while attending high school in Santa Ana, she
returned to Mexico for several months when her grandmother died. She
and her mother returned to the United States, only to learn they had
missed the amnesty deadline. Her mother has since died.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez Hernandez tried to attend college but could not afford
the out-of-state tuition assessed students without proper immigration
documents. She now works two jobs, in a restaurant and as an
attendant to an older woman, earning about $7 an hour and $440 a
week.</TE>
<TE>   "There are rules and we have to follow them, but sometimes you
wonder why the rules could not be developed so that someone like me
is not left behind," Fernandez Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration
Reform, which opposed the 1986 amnesty legislation, does not think
undocumented immigrants who failed to meet INS guidelines in 1986
deserve a second chance.</TE>
<TE>   "The rules laid down by Congress were clear," Mehlman said. "They
did say you had to have continuous presence in the United States.
There is no God-given right to break the law and get amnesty. It's
not so bad that someone went to celebrate Christmas in Mexico. It's
that they came into the country illegally again. Even if you came in
with a tourist card, you are not eligible to live in the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA.com, which seeks to
reduce immigration levels, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1986 amnesty was an incredible and unprecedented gift to
about 3 million immigration lawbreakers," Beck said. "It was not an
entitlement or some kind of human right. If some lawbreakers failed
to get in on the spoils, we as a nation have no reason to be
concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Kice, an INS spokeswoman, said the law's larger purpose
has been lost in the debate. "The whole debate got to be, when has
someone abandoned their illegal residence, when they did leave and
for how long," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Alcantar, who came to the United States from Guanajuato state to
visit a sweetheart from her village, married at 18 and made the U.S.
her home, even though she left to celebrate Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   And when her husband abused her physically and verbally, she said,
she had no choice but to stay in the United States. She had no
financial support in Mexico. In the United States, she could get only
low-paying jobs. Meanwhile, her husband threatened to turn her in to
the INS if she complained.</TE>
<TE>   When she tried to apply for amnesty in 1986, she was denied
because she had visited family in Guanajuato. Still undocumented, she
endured years of domestic abuse because she feared being turned over
to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, through a new law that protects immigrant victims of
domestic violence, she got a work permit that expires in August.</TE>
<TE>   She said she might have developed a real career instead of earning
less than $5 an hour cleaning a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, she developed cancer in a leg. Recently, she was
diagnosed with a tumor in her lung. Again, she is relying on the man
who abused her for health insurance after she was rejected for it
because she used a false Social Security number before being given
the work permit. A live-in boyfriend helps with other expenses
because she can't work.</TE>
<TE>   "All these years, so much hinged on the card," she said. "Time
passed, and I was never able to get a good job or have the real
liberties that the United States has to offer."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the high desert, amid the open spaces and blowing tumbleweeds, the
jam-packed highways of the Antelope Valley seem as out of place as
Joshua trees in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   But the increasingly big-city-like congestion is no mirage.</LD>
<LD>   With the region's population of 400,000 expected to triple within
20 years, transportation officials are scrambling to head off a
crisis on the valley's roads and highways.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like a little Mt. Vesuvius," Palmdale City Councilman Rick
Norris said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem has become more urgent as pressure mounts to reopen
and expand Palmdale Airport. Los Angeles World Airports, which owns
the airport, wants it to eventually pick up some of the passenger
load from Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   In the next few months, the Los Angeles Airport Commission is
expected to grant a right of way allowing the California Department
of Transportation to construct a 5.3-mile expressway that would
connect Palmdale Airport to the Antelope Valley Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans hopes to complete the $165-million expressway by 2010.
The agency still needs $140 million.</TE>
<TE>   The six-lane expressway would feed into the proposed High Desert
Corridor, a 65-mile network of highways that would cross the valley.</TE>
<TE>   The corridor would provide an east-west alternative to Pearblossom
Highway, starting from the Antelope Valley Freeway and stretching to
Victorville in San Bernardino County.</TE>
<TE>   It is far from breaking ground. The final price tag might exceed
$1 billion, and only about $36 million has been allocated so far,
Caltrans project manager Abdi Saghafi said. More funds could become
available from Proposition 42, last week's successful ballot measure
that dedicates state sales taxes on gasoline to transportation
projects.</TE>
<TE>   At the earliest, the corridor likely would not be completed for 20
years, Saghafi said.</TE>
<TE>   The corridor would also carry traffic to Palmdale Airport, which
has not had commercial service since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are in discussions with five airlines, and commercial
flights could resume by the end of the year, Norris said.</TE>
<TE>   LAX serves about 61 million passengers a year. By 2025, that
number is expected to grow to 78 million, said Jim Ritchie, deputy
executive director of Los Angeles World Airports, which also runs the
Van Nuys and Ontario airports.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale Airport is expected to serve 1.7 million passengers by
2025, Ritchie said, but for that to happen the region's highway
system must improve. "Ground transportation is critical for the
success of an airport," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Plans also are being developed to widen Pearblossom Highway, known
as the "Highway of Death" because of its steep accident rate.
Caltrans expects to complete that project by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "Every elected official is working desperately to relieve the kind
of congestion we have," said Lancaster Mayor Frank C. Roberts, who is
a member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board.</TE>
<TE>   The officials have been lobbying the California High Speed Rail
Authority to lay tracks in the Antelope Valley. The authority is
planning a high-speed line from Sacramento to San Diego and will
decide whether to route it through Palmdale or the Grapevine.</TE>
<TE>   If Palmdale isn't chosen, "we're going to be drowning in people
and cars" from the region's ballooning population, said Jerry
Epstein, a member of the rail agency and former chairman of the
California Transportation Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Another idea, now on ice, is a decades-old proposal to bore a
15.5-mile auto tunnel through the San Gabriel Mountains from Palmdale
to La Canada Flintridge. A recent study concluded the project could
cost up to $2 billion, which makes it unfeasible, Norris said.</TE>
<TE>   The airport expressway would not require tunneling, but it would
plow through Unity Church of the Antelope Valley. That doesn't bother
the Rev. Al Johnson. He said his flock of about 100 is outgrowing the
sanctuary and needs to move. The church members also strongly support
any effort to improve transportation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We need that airport in terms of growth and we need that
[expressway]," Johnson said.</TE>

<LD>In the high desert, amid the open spaces and blowing tumbleweeds, the
jam-packed highways of the Antelope Valley seem as out of place as
Joshua trees in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   But the increasingly big-city-like congestion is no mirage.</LD>
<LD>   With the region's population of 400,000 expected to triple within
20 years, transportation officials are scrambling to head off a
crisis on the valley's roads and highways.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like a little Mt. Vesuvius," Palmdale City Councilman Rick
Norris said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem has become more urgent as pressure mounts to reopen
and expand Palmdale Airport. Los Angeles World Airports, which owns
the airport, wants it to eventually pick up some of the passenger
load from Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   In the next few months, the Los Angeles Airport Commission is
expected to grant a right of way allowing the California Department
of Transportation to construct a 5.3-mile expressway that would
connect Palmdale Airport to the Antelope Valley Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans hopes to complete the $165-million expressway by 2010.
The agency still needs $140 million.</TE>
<TE>   The six-lane expressway would feed into the proposed High Desert
Corridor, a 65-mile network of highways that would cross the valley.</TE>
<TE>   The corridor would provide an east-west alternative to the
Pearblossom Highway, starting from the Antelope Valley Freeway and
stretching to Victorville in San Bernardino County.</TE>
<TE>   It is far from breaking ground. The final price tag might exceed
$1 billion, and only about $36 million has been allocated so far,
Caltrans project manager Abdi Saghafi said. More funds could become
available from Proposition 42, last week's successful ballot measure
that dedicates state sales taxes on gasoline to transportation
projects.</TE>
<TE>   At the earliest, the corridor likely would not be completed for 20
years, Saghafi said.</TE>
<TE>   The corridor would also carry traffic to Palmdale Airport, which
has not had commercial service since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are in discussions with five airlines, and commercial
flights could resume by the end of the year, Norris said.</TE>
<TE>   LAX serves about 61 million passengers a year. By 2025, that
number is expected to grow to 78 million, said Jim Ritchie, deputy
executive director for Los Angeles World Airports, which also runs
the Van Nuys and Ontario airports.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale Airport is expected to serve 1.7 million passengers by
2025, Ritchie said, but for that to happen the region's highway
system must improve. "Ground transportation is critical for the
success of an airport," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Plans also are being developed to widen the two-lane Pearblossom
Highway, known as the "Highway of Death" because of its steep
accident rate.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans expects to complete that project by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "Every elected official is working desperately to relieve the kind
of congestion we have," said Lancaster Mayor Frank C. Roberts, who is
a member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board.</TE>
<TE>   The officials have been lobbying the California High Speed Rail
Authority to lay tracks in the Antelope Valley. The authority is
planning a high-speed line from Sacramento to San Diego and will
decide whether to route it through Palmdale or the Grapevine.</TE>
<TE>   If Palmdale isn't chosen, "we're going to be drowning in people
and cars" from the region's ballooning population, said Jerry
Epstein, a member of the rail agency and former chairman of the
California Transportation Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Another idea, now on ice, is a decades-old proposal to bore a
15.5-mile auto tunnel through the San Gabriel Mountains from Palmdale
to La Canada Flintridge. A recent study concluded the project could
cost up to $2 billion, which makes it unfeasible, Norris said.</TE>
<TE>   The airport expressway would not require tunneling, but it would
plow through the Unity Church of the Antelope Valley. That doesn't
bother the Rev. Al Johnson. He said his flock of about 100 is
outgrowing the sanctuary and needs to move. The church members also
strongly support any effort to improve transportation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We need that airport in terms of growth and we need that
[expressway]," Johnson said.</TE>

<LD>Bordered by smokestacks and slag heaps, Ormond Beach hasn't yet
caught the wave of ecotourism, but the possibility intrigued more
than 100 people gathered on the Oxnard shoreline Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Toting binoculars and cameras, the crowd traipsed down the beach,
on the lookout for natural wonders. Here, a bunch peered down at the
slithering tracks of Globose dune beetles; there, a woman shouted
that she had spotted a black-legged kittiwake, a gull more common to
Siberia than Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The event came at what environmentalists see as a time of both
promise and peril for the relatively unused strand just down the
coast from the Hueneme Pier.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, the state cracked down on Halaco, an aluminum recycler
that over three decades has spewed out a 40-foot high ridge of gray
waste at the edge of the beach's environmentally fragile wetlands.
The firm was ordered to stop the deposits by December.</TE>
<TE>   But even as environmental activists celebrated the state's
decision, they were troubled by the city of Oxnard's interest in
plans for more industrial construction around the beach. In addition
to Halaco, the Ormond Beach area already is home to a paper mill, a
power plant and a sewage treatment facility.</TE>
<TE>   For all that, an impressive array of migratory birds, some of them
fixtures on the endangered lists, touches down at Ormond. Ten percent
of the state's California least terns nest on fenced-off patches of
sand. Snowy plovers--little puffballs that are barely visible as they
skitter down the beach--bunk in the dunes. The pygmy blue, the
world's smallest butterfly, flits amid the marsh grasses that support
it.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news at Ormond is that there's still a lot to work
with--even in a degraded environment," said Wayne Ferren, a wetlands
ecologist at UC Santa Barbara. "Think of what it could be if it were
cleaned up."</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood groups want the city to restrict development and turn
Ormond's 1,400 acres into a wildlife preserve.</TE>
<TE>   But mindful of boosting their city's tax base, Oxnard officials
have expressed interest in several development plans, including a
food distributor's proposal for a 50-acre regional headquarters. They
say none of the projects would harm the environment, and point to
their intent to keep as much as a quarter of the area undeveloped.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council is to discuss the matter at its Tuesday meeting.</TE>
<TE>   At a talk before Saturday's beach outing, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service biologist David Pereksta said a bird refuge could be the
ideal economic development scheme for the site.</TE>
<TE>   An Audubon Society member, Pereksta said that bird festivals are
"a vital part of the economy" at spots throughout the nation.
Bird-rich Ventura County would do well to spread its wings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   When he lived in New Jersey, Pereksta logged 301 bird species on a
list he had kept for years, he said. In Ventura County last year, he
said he spotted 333.</TE>
<TE>   "People come from all over the U.S. to see the birds on the
Channel Islands and they want to know other good birding spots," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, a woman from Indiana was on the track of a bird
called a red-throated pipit. When she heard that a few were seen on
the sod farms of the Oxnard Plain, she called Pereksta to confirm it.</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'I'll fly out tomorrow,'" he recalled.</TE>

<LD>Retired Bishop Norman F. McFarland was honored Saturday in Anaheim by
a national Catholic organization that promotes family values and
anti-communism.</LD>
<LD>   The St. Louis-based Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation, named after a
Hungarian cardinal imprisoned by that country's communist government
in 1948, recognizes Catholic figures who have excelled in upholding
the principles of faith, family and freedom, foundation officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   About 200 foundation members and local Catholics assembled at the
Sheraton Hotel in Anaheim to honor McFarland, who served as bishop of
the Diocese of Orange from 1986 to 1998, when he retired.</LD>
<TE>   McFarland, who said he met Mindszenty when the cardinal visited
the United States in 1974, urged those gathered to follow in the
footsteps of the late Hungarian activist.</TE>
<TE>   "The word 'martyr' means witness, and that's what he was," the
80-year-old bishop said.</TE>
<TE>   And quoting a 19th century English essayist, McFarland said "the
greatest thing a soul can do is see something and tell clearly what
it saw."</TE>

<LD>Two Norwalk men have been arrested in connection with the fatal
shooting of a 20-year-old college football player at a party in
August, according to Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies.</LD>
<LD>   The suspects, Jose Luna, 23, and Rafael Isaac Picado, 21, were
arrested Friday night at their homes on suspicion of murdering Kevin
Morris, said Deputy Roberta Granek.</LD>
<LD>   Luna and Picado are being held at the department's Norwalk station
in lieu of $2-million bail each.</LD>
<TE>   Morris, a native of Panorama City and a defensive back for
Antelope Valley College, was shot in the upper torso while attending
the party in Norwalk on Aug. 12. His teammate, 21-year-old Jerome
Wright, was shot in the arm.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies said they believe the shooting was racially motivated.
Both victims are black, and both suspects are Latino.</TE>

<LD>A 3-year-old girl was critically injured and two adults were wounded
when a gunman opened fire on their vehicle Friday night on the Pomona
Freeway, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   Three other children, ages 6, 7 and 8, and two other adults were
riding in a blue van when two men in a beige van opened fire,
according to Det. Steve Mills.</LD>
<LD>   The beige van had followed the victims' van south on Hacienda
Boulevard and then onto the freeway about 11:15 p.m., Mills said. As
the two vehicles headed east, at least one of the men in the beige
van began shooting, the detective said.</LD>
<TE>   The 3-year-old, who was shot in the back, was in stable condition
Saturday at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. Her mother, who was also
shot in the back, is in stable condition at County-USC Medical
Center. A man who was shot in the hand was treated and released.</TE>

<HD>Police Learning to Deal With Mentally Ill</HD>
<DH>Safety: After spate of officer-involved shootings last
year, a new training program at sheriff's academy is showing results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clutching her month-old daughter like a rag doll, the distraught
woman warned Ventura police that she would slam the infant on the
pavement if they didn't back off.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Ramiro Capa trained his flashlight on the woman and
immediately began talking, trying to win her confidence. After a few
tense minutes, the baby was safe in the hands of officers and the
woman was on her way to a clinic for treatment. Mission accomplished.</LD>
<LD>   "You try to build a rapport with the person and find something you
have in common," Capa said in describing the delicate negotiations
that took place in late January. "You get a little bit nervous
because you don't know what this lady may do. She was very
unpredictable."</LD>
<TE>   Law enforcement and mental health officials credit a new training
course for officers such as Capa with helping save the baby's life.
Capa and 33 other officers were the first to complete the 40-hour
mental health training program at the Ventura County sheriff's
academy in Camarillo in December.</TE>
<TE>   Such training has become increasingly important because police
often are confronted with incidents involving the mentally ill,
officials said. Last year, Oxnard police fatally shot three disturbed
people.</TE>
<TE>   During the past decade, county law enforcement officers have been
involved in the homicides of at least 17 mentally ill people,
according to a new grand jury report.</TE>
<TE>   After a review, the grand jury recommended that all local police
officers and dispatchers take the new academy training course,
modeled after successful programs at other agencies across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Such training "will decrease the number of police shootings," the
grand jury concluded, and "the lives of citizens and police will, as
a consequence, be saved."</TE>
<TE>   The hope among the program's creators is that officers will learn
to exercise restraint whenever possible in dealing with an
emotionally or mentally troubled person. It is important to think all
the options through, to determine what kind of help a person needs
before acting, said Ventura Police Sgt. Mark Stadler, who helped
design the county's Crisis Intervention Training program.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't regular police work and we realize the danger
involved," Stadler said. At the same time, when dealing with mentally
disturbed individuals, "we don't want to corner them where they feel
trapped."</TE>
<TE>   Stadler, who teaches a class on officer-involved shootings at the
academy, is no novice when it comes to dealing with such cases.</TE>
<TE>   In June, he was summoned to talk to a man threatening to leap from
a railroad trestle above the Ventura Freeway. After three hours of
negotiations, the man agreed to climb down.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was an incident that occurred 14 years ago. Six weeks
out of the training academy, the then-Santa Barbara police officer
confronted a machete-wielding man who had wounded several people
during a rampage.</TE>
<TE>   When Stadler encountered the assailant, the man lunged toward him
and the officer opened fire. The wounded man staggered toward Stadler
and collapsed at his feet.</TE>
<TE>   Had he known then what he knows now, Stadler said, he may have
tried to handle the situation differently when he arrived on the
scene.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have done anything different after he attacked me,"
Stadler said. "But before, I would have tried to communicate with him
and find out what was bothering him and find out what it was that
brought him to that point ... I didn't come to this job to take
lives."</TE>
<TE>   Organizers Hope to Train 10% of Officers</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of the new training program hope it will reduce the
number of officer-involved shootings. At least 150 police officers
and dispatchers are expected to complete the course this year.</TE>
<TE>   The training includes courses taught by mental health officials
that cover everything from role playing to drugs used by the mentally
ill. Every local police agency sent officers to the program in
December. The goal of the training coordinators is to have 10% of all
officers trained eventually.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis of the program is on "increased people skills," said
Dr. Michael Ferguson, a psychiatrist who works with inmates and
helped craft the course's 100-page training manual.</TE>
<TE>   In typical police training, officers are taught the importance of
establishing an aggressive and commanding presence in potentially
violent situations.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time that's appropriate," Stadler said. But when
dealing with the mentally ill, the emphasis is on "talking softly and
listening."</TE>
<TE>   Having trained officers at the scene will allow more time for a
member of the county's busy mental health crisis unit to respond,
said Patrick Oviedo, a member of the crisis unit. The program has
already helped officers in the field diffuse situations before they
spiraled out of control, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The trainees "have had a profound effect on the mortality rate,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is a noble effort, it will take more than just a week of
training to fix the problems that led to the spate of
officer-involved shootings last year, said attorney Greg Ramirez. He
formerly represented the family of Robert Jones, a man with a history
of mental problems who was shot by Oxnard police on Aug. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard police said they had no choice but to shoot Jones because
he moved toward them with a 13-inch knife. Jones' family has sued the
department for negligence.</TE>
<TE>   "Training in and of itself does not change people," Ramirez said.
"The change in the mental attitude has to start at the top. The
leadership sets the standard."</TE>
<TE>   Since last year's shootings, there has been mounting community
pressure for police agencies to better prepare their officers for
dealing with the mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   The string of officer-involved shootings began in January 2000
when the Oxnard SWAT team shot and killed a 17-year-old boy holding a
female student hostage at Hueneme High School and ended in October
with the shooting of a knife-wielding man in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office has ruled that police were
justified in three of the four fatal shootings involving mentally ill
suspects. But investigators have yet to rule on the Jones case.</TE>
<TE>   With the closing of Camarillo State Hospital in 1997 and continued
budget cuts for mental health facilities and programs, the number of
confrontations between police and mentally ill people will continue
to rise, the grand jury report warned.</TE>
<TE>   The problem boils down to the fact that there are numerous
mentally ill people on the street with little oversight, said Lou
Matthews, a consultant for the police training course and a member of
the county chapter of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.</TE>
<TE>   The new police program is "like putting your finger in the dam,"
Matthews said. "It's not solving the whole problem."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez said he is in full support of the
specialized training but warned that it won't stand in the way of
police protecting themselves and the community.</TE>
<TE>   "The mental health system is broken down ... the first responders
are going to be the ones thrown into the situation more and more,"
Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be able to bring these situations to a peaceful
conclusion where there isn't a use of lethal force," he said. "But
the fact is that sometimes [suspects] leave us with no other choice."</TE>

<HD>LAPD's Elite Units Being Scaled Back</HD>
<DH>Police: Labor shortage, tight budgets prompt redeployment
to bolster the patrol force. Even the popular DARE program may be
slashed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A labor shortage and tight budgets have combined to force sharp
cutbacks in the Los Angeles Police Department's most elite units,
including narcotics, and the crunch is now so severe that city
officials are considering slashing the DARE drug education
effort--long one of the LAPD's most popular programs.</LD>
<LD>   Retirements and resignations have outpaced recruitment of new LAPD
officers. The resulting shortages have affected the entire
department, but specialized divisions--staffed mainly by
investigators and more highly trained officers--have been especially
hard hit.</LD>
<LD>   This is not an accident. Police Chief Bernard C. Parks has
deliberately allowed vacancies to soar in such divisions so they
don't stack up in another, more critical area: patrol.</LD>
<TE>   The point is to redirect the LAPD's resources toward its most
essential function--providing uniformed officers to answer emergency
calls and patrol the streets, he said.</TE>
<TE>   So, as the number of LAPD officers has fallen to about 8,910 from
a pinnacle of 9,852 in June 1998, Parks and his command staff have
made a series of Solomonic redeployment decisions, cutting deeply
into the narcotics, organized crime and vice, and financial crimes
units, so more officers can be assigned to black-and-whites.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said that the upside has been a strengthened patrol force,
and that today there are more officers working patrol than in 1993--a
year in which the LAPD's force was of a similar size.</TE>
<TE>   But despite these efforts, patrol functions continue to be
strained. Police emergency response times have crept up slightly
citywide to a current average of 8.7 minutes, while the amount of
discretionary time officers have to spend on non-emergency problems
has diminished.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like we're in a sinking boat and the water is rising, and we
only have a little cup to keep bailing," said Police Commission
President Rick Caruso.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a looming citywide budget shortfall is adding to the
difficulties, forcing city leaders to take an even harder look at
LAPD deployment.</TE>
<TE>   One possible target for trimming may be the Drug Abuse Resistance
Education program launched in 1983, in which police officers teach
schoolchildren about the risks of illegal drug use.</TE>
<TE>   Although it has received criticism from some quarters, DARE is
considered a proud achievement by LAPD officials because the
department invented the concept, which has since been adopted in
communities nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the officer shortage, positions in the DARE program
have been reduced over the last two years. DARE Capt. Mark Perez said
he has 73 officers rather than the 119 allotted in his budget.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Caruso has urged the department to go further. He
has proposed temporarily reassigning DARE officers to more critical
functions, such as patrol, in the interests of "putting them on the
street where they are needed."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal is supported by the Police Protective League, which
represents LAPD officers, and the commission will consider it in the
coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Mayor James K. Hahn has proposed cutting all
officers from DARE, except for seven based at law enforcement magnet
schools, to help balance next year's city budget. The move would free
up about 75 officers for patrol cars if their supervisors are
included.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting more officers on the street to help address the crime
problem is a top priority for the mayor," said Deputy Mayor Matt
Middlebrook. Alternatives, such as seeking volunteers among retirees
or reserves to maintain DARE, are being considered, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said he will argue for maintaining at least a portion of the
program because of its value in preventing crime and fostering
community involvement. A possible alternative, he said, is to
eliminate positions from joint task forces with other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome, there remains the long-standing problem of
finding more recruits to fill officer positions already approved.</TE>
<TE>   Police departments across the country have had difficulties
recruiting new officers recently. But the LAPD, whose attempt to
expand its force rapidly generated much public controversy amid the
Rampart Division corruption scandal, has had an especially hard time.</TE>
<TE>   Unless its ranks grow, the LAPD is stuck with "managing by
crisis," Caruso said.</TE>
<TE>   Several LAPD commanders echoed Caruso's view that, given the labor
crunch, Parks' redeployment decisions have been reasonable, even
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The chief "doesn't get credit for putting emphasis on patrol,"
said 77th Street Division Capt. James Miller.</TE>
<TE>   But, in the process, some of Parks' choices have been
controversial.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the officers union, for example, are critical of the
number of those reassigned to jobs related to risk management and
investigating and disciplining officers while the Patrol Division
struggles.</TE>
<TE>   Those changes in large part are mandated to fulfill demands of a
federal consent decree signed in 2000. Transfers of 126 sworn
officers and 33 civilians have been approved for such functions,
augmenting Internal Affairs, auditing and use-of-force
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The chief said he doesn't have much choice in this. But Police
Protective League President Mitzi Grasso--a Parks opponent--said the
department should find ways to perform the jobs more efficiently.</TE>
<TE>   The deployments also have generated more public reaction.
Community activists from Boyle Heights recently appealed to the
Police Commission to remedy what they say is a lack of narcotics
enforcement in their neighborhood, which is troubled by gangs.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy, centered in the LAPD's Hollenbeck Division,
erupted after police resources were further strained by security
demands following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Elite investigators from the already depleted ranks of the
narcotics staff were among those temporarily reassigned to
anti-terrorist investigations.</TE>
<TE>   That happened just as some Boyle Heights residents were asking for
more officers to perform surveillance of houses used for drug sales.</TE>
<TE>   "We found out that, lo and behold, the city is unprotected," said
William Murray, a Montecito Heights resident who has been among those
organizing the political push.</TE>
<TE>   The activists succeeded in getting the commission to study issues
of specialized gang and narcotics forces--not just for Boyle Heights
but citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Eastside residents also staged a march on police
headquarters to further highlight the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Their criticisms of the chief have added to the political
controversy surrounding the commission's consideration of whether
Parks, who is nearing the end of his first five-year term, should be
reappointed.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials say many of the reassigned narcotics officers have
since gone back to their regular jobs. But the more long-standing
staffing problems remain acute.</TE>
<TE>   The number of vacancies in the LAPD's specialized divisions has
expanded to about 350. Sept. 11 aside, narcotics has declined by 100
positions to 220 in 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   The Metro Division has pared about 50 positions from
crime-suppression platoons. That move required LAPD officials to back
away from a function they had fought for years to expand, and meant
sending some officers who had advanced to coveted downtown jobs back
to the precincts.</TE>
<TE>   Also diminished are the Training and Juvenile divisions.</TE>
<TE>   At the precinct level, Parks told captains to observe a 15% cap on
the portion of patrol forces reassigned to special duties, such as
gang details, in order to maintain patrol numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Some precinct captains have had to eliminate bicycle and foot
patrols. The pressure to staff black-and-whites has also meant
tapping community outreach officers known as senior leads, a
hard-fought issue that has played into the question of whether Parks
should be reappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has made the LAPD's labor shortage one of his chief
criticisms of Parks, whose reappointment he opposes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate we have to make any of these types of
decisions," said Middlebrook, the deputy mayor. "They are the result
of the inability to recruit officers and grow the department."</TE>
<TE>   Parks said that the department must not look to increasing
recruitment as the cure for all of its problems, and that he is
working to ensure that existing resources are used more effectively.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he and Hahn agree with Caruso that the need to
maintain sufficient forces in patrol duties simply outweighs other
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials concede that the redeployments may have made the
department less able to prevent future crimes; for example, there are
fewer narcotics officers to upset drug markets.</TE>
<TE>   But, said Cmdr. Dan Koenig, "We can't say to you, 'Wait two more
minutes for an officer because in six months you won't be calling,'
because you'll say, 'I don't have two more minutes--someone is coming
through my door now.'"</TE>

<HD>Ron Howard Wins Acclaim of Directors</HD>
<DH>Movies: Guild award for his work on 'A Beautiful Mind'
boosts prospects that he will garner his first Oscar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of watching the Oscar elude his grasp, director Ron
Howard saw his chances of winning his first Academy Award
strengthened Saturday night when his peers in the Directors Guild of
America singled out his work in "A Beautiful Mind" for the top
directors' achievement in feature films.</LD>
<LD>   Howard's film, about how mathematics professor John Nash wins the
Nobel Prize despite his long battle with schizophrenia, was honored
at the 54th annual awards dinner at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Only five times since the DGA awards' inception in 1949 has the
winner not gone on to win best director at the Academy Awards. Until
this year, Howard had been overlooked by the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences, winning a DGA award for 1995's "Apollo 13"
but watching Mel Gibson walk off with the Oscar that year for
"Braveheart."</LD>
<TE>   Howard, who grew up before millions of television viewers as the
carrot-topped Opie on "The Andy Griffith Show" and later as teenager
Richie Cunningham on the hit sitcom "Happy Days," has long been one
of Hollywood's top-grossing directors.</TE>
<TE>   For the DGA contest, he beat out Peter Jackson for "The Lord of
the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Christopher Nolan for
"Memento," Ridley Scott for "Black Hawk Down" and Baz Luhrmann for
"Moulin Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   Other winners Saturday night included Bob Kerstetter for
commercials; Amy Schatz for children's programs; Chris Hegedus and
Jehane Noujaim for the documentary "Startup.com"; and William Ludel
for the ABC soap opera "General Hospital."</TE>
<TE>   Also honored were Frank Pierson for movies for television for
HBO's "Conspiracy"; Alan Ball for dramatic television series for the
pilot to HBO's "Six Feet Under"; Todd Holland for comedy series for
an episode titled "Bowling" for the Fox sitcom "Malcolm in the
Middle"; and Joel Gallen and Beth McCarthy-Miller in the musical
variety category for "America: A Tribute to Heroes."</TE>
<TE>   A few hours before the awards ceremony, DGA President Jack Shea
announced his resignation during a special meeting of the guild's
National Board of Directors.</TE>
<TE>   The board elected First Vice President Martha Coolidge to succeed
Shea, according to a DGA statement. Coolidge will be the first woman
president of the guild.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a tradition at the DGA for the president to only
serve two terms," Shea said in the statement. "At our national
convention last June, I advised the delegates that I would run for a
third term in order to provide continuity of leadership for our
upcoming contract negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   Shea was picked to take the helm of the DGA for another term.</TE>
<TE>   "I also informed the delegates at that time that I intended to
step down as president following a successful conclusion to our
negotiations," he said</TE>
<TE>   ."Thanks to our outstanding negotiating committee, our
negotiations were successfully concluded and our contract
overwhelmingly ratified by our members," he said. "I feel it is now
time for me to do what I said I would do."</TE>
<TE>   Coolidge has directed such works as "Valley Girl," "Rambling Rose"
and "Real Genius," which won Grand Prix honors at the Paris Film
Festival in 1986.</TE>

<HD>Rock Stars, Kids Join to Aid Hospice</HD>
<DH>Linkin Park concert organized by Mirman students raises
$85,000 for gravely ill children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The kids in Mirman School's seventh-grade community service class are
on a roll.</LD>
<LD>   Let them loose on the nation's budget deficit. Send them to the
Middle East. They seem to have a knack for pulling off the big play.</LD>
<LD>   A few months ago, youngsters who attend the private Santa Monica
school decided to help a charity, TrinityKids Care, a pediatric
hospice that provides home care to terminally ill children and their
families.</LD>
<TE>   The seventh-graders, led by 13-year-old Matthew Geffner, thought
that putting on a student concert to raise money for TrinityKids
would be a cool idea. But these Mirman students don't think small.
They wanted Linkin Park, a Grammy-winning Los Angeles group that is
among the hottest tickets in rock, and they wanted the House of
Blues.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday they put it all together in a benefit that attracted
more than 800 screaming fans, raised more than $85,000 for the
charity and left everyone involved a little dazed by it all.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the front dancing with all my friends, just having so
much fun and feeling like it was incredible to get this great
opportunity," Matthew said. That a gaggle of 12- and 13-year-olds was
able to pull off such a feat is a testament to their determination,
the warmheartedness of a group of hard rockers and the ability of
dogs to make their owners chummy with one another. More on that
later.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a longshot, and we got so lucky," Matthew, sitting with a
group of fellow students who coordinated the benefit, said modestly.
"We were originally going to put on a small dance at school with a
B-list band. But it got bigger and bigger."</TE>
<TE>   When the students decided they wanted to take on a project to get
credit in their community service class, Matthew approached Brook
Dougherty, a family friend who runs a small marketing firm that works
with nonprofit groups.</TE>
<TE>   Dougherty said she was impressed by their ambition and commitment.
And the cause they embraced was close to their hearts--one of their
classmates had become gravely ill.</TE>
<TE>   But their chances of getting a group like Linkin Park were slim to
none, Dougherty thought. And then another of the fortuitous
coincidences that has seemed to hover over the project fell into
place.</TE>
<TE>   Dougherty's daughter had been watching television one evening when
she shouted out, "Mom, we're on MTV." The program, "Cribs," profiles
rock stars at home and on that night featured Linkin Park.</TE>
<TE>   Dougherty caught a glimpse of her neighborhood and discovered that
band member Chester Bennington and his wife, Samantha, lived across
the street. Samantha Bennington and Dougherty had frequently
encountered each other walking their dogs.</TE>
<TE>   When the students said they wanted Linkin Park for their benefit,
Dougherty knocked on the Benningtons' door at 11 p.m. to deliver a
letter the students had worked on for days.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just taken by the whole story," said Samantha Bennington.
"Chester and I are very much involved with charities, as is the
entire band. As soon as he got home, I talked to him. He discussed it
with the band, and there was no hesitation--they all said, 'Let's do
it.'"</TE>
<TE>   Linkin Park exploded in popularity last year with a best-selling
album that mixes rap and rock through songs that speak to the rage,
bewilderment, vulnerability and yet hopefulness of youth. The
six-member band won a Grammy at last month's award ceremony for best
hard rock performance.</TE>
<TE>   The group had played on a San Diego radio station for a Red Cross
benefit after Sept. 11. But this was its first in-person charity
event, which members promoted on their Web site and in interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "It worked out the way it did because it was so genuine," Chester
Bennington said. "It wasn't like they wanted new uniforms for the
football team. New uniforms are important, but it's just not the same
as helping seriously ill kids. The students have done something
really great, and it came from a sincere place."</TE>
<TE>   After Linkin Park signed on, the group approached the House of
Blues, which agreed to host the benefit.</TE>
<TE>   The students met on campus each week, planning their special
night, enlisting volunteers, designing menus and writing letters to
each member of Linkin Park to express their gratitude.</TE>
<TE>   At the concert they also got to meet young kids who are battling
life-threatening illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Ten-year-old Alan Garcia, suffering from a brain tumor, was there
with his mom, Angie; dad, Abel; and 13-year-old brother, Abel Jr.
"I'm very excited," said Alan, who celebrated a birthday last week.
"I know a lot of their songs."</TE>
<TE>   As he waited to meet the band, he proudly showed off an autograph
he'd gotten from comedian Robin Williams through the Make-A-Wish
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   But Alan is a budding rock drummer, and when Linkin Park drummer
Rob Bourdon handed him a pair of autographed sticks, he didn't know
what to say.</TE>
<TE>   Trinity Care Hospice President Claire Tehan said the evening was
like a dream for her organization, which last year opened TrinityKids
Care as a specialized pediatric division of the Torrance hospice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only having kids helping kids and the money they will
raise, but getting the word out to parents that this service is
available," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Mirman students, meanwhile, got double credit for their
project, Matthew said. But they're not through.</TE>
<TE>   "After the concert, we went home and just slept a lot," he said.

<HD>Tax-Break Gold in Donated Hills</HD>
<DH>Development: The Irvine Co. may get a huge IRS break in its
transfer of 11,000 acres to O.C. Site may be valued at $500 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren's gift of 11,000 acres of open
space to the people of Orange County could also reap the company
hundreds of millions of dollars in tax deductions, in what appears to
be the largest tax break of its kind.</LD>
<LD>   Using "conservation easements"--an increasingly popular method of
preserving land--the company is signing over development rights on
the land while retaining ownership for 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   That will yield not just hefty tax breaks but also the ability to
design and control public access as the company sees fit.</LD>
<TE>   By writing off thousands of acres of steep, nearly unbuildable
terrain prone to landslides, along with prime smaller pieces slated
for development, the company also could maximize value on land that
is worth as little as 3 cents a square foot on the latest tax rolls.</TE>
<TE>   Bren's gift, announced in November, has been widely praised by
company critics and admirers alike. The subject of tax breaks for the
company has drawn speculation but no criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tax benefit, all of it is legal, all of it's correct,"
said Theresa Sears, an Orange resident who has fought Irvine Co.
developments in east Orange, including some on lands that will now be
preserved.</TE>
<TE>   "The people benefited, and Bren, a smart man, will benefit too.
It's a win-win for everybody. So none of us over here that got our
gift have to be beholden to the Irvine Co. down the road, because Don
Bren got a gift too."</TE>
<TE>   Craig Atkins, partner at O'Donnell Atkins Co., California's
largest land broker, said the tax breaks are part of the beauty of
the package.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fantastic deal for everyone," Atkins said. "You can't pave
over everything. If you're a neighbor living in Orange County, it's
great, and if you're [Bren's] banker, it's also great.... That's Don
Bren. He's got it wired.... The guy is brilliant."</TE>
<TE>   Bren is sole owner of the Irvine Co. Company officials declined to
be interviewed about the tax ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't discuss finances," said spokesman Rich Elbaum.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Florian, group senior vice president of corporate affairs,
said: "Whatever charitable contribution would be permitted under law
is what would be applicable here."</TE>
<TE>   She said she was not familiar with the details but "ultimately,
that is decided by the IRS."</TE>
<TE>   An IRS spokesman confirmed the legal structure of conservation
easements but said no information about specific cases could be
released by the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation easements allow a donor who signs away development
rights to deduct the difference between what the land would have sold
for if it could be developed and what it would sell for without such
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Income-tax records and land appraisals are private, but several
land-sales professionals, including Atkins, said that in the red-hot
Southern California real estate market, the total acreage with
development rights would sell for at least $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   Without the potential for development, the land would be worth as
little as $88 million, those same experts said. The tax deduction
under this scenario would be $412 million--the value of the lost
development rights.</TE>
<TE>   Experts interviewed emphasized that those figures probably
understate the value of the property and the ensuing deduction.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lack of supply of housing and a glut of demand in
Orange County," which drives up the worth of land that can be
developed, said Bob Holman, a certified general appraiser at CB
Commercial in Orange County. "Appraisal is an art as much as a
science, and there's always a range of potential values.... [$500
million] is a conservative figure," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the amount of the deduction, "it will absolutely be the
largest" of its kind, said Stephen Small, who wrote the original IRS
code on conservation easements and has written four books on land
ownership and taxes. Small, now a Boston-based private attorney, has
prepared hundreds of conservation easements and said the most
substantial yielded tax benefits of $10 million to $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Land Trust Alliance, a national nonprofit that tracks open
land, said the number of conservation easements is "skyrocketing."</TE>
<TE>   Usually they are used to preserve smaller, prized pieces in resort
areas like Jackson Hole, Wyo.; Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts; or
Aspen, Colo.; or large rural lands. In the largest acreage
conservation easement to date, the Pingree timber family signed over
development rights to 750,000 acres of Maine woods and was paid $30
million. Because the family was paid, it did not receive income-tax
deductions.</TE>
<TE>   But because of its size and location in fast-growing, wealthy
Orange County, "there is no land like Bren's anywhere else in the
U.S.," said Atkins, the California land broker.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation easements can be tailored to the landowner's wishes
as long as they do not irrevocably destroy ecological values.</TE>
<TE>   Bren and the Irvine Co. are dividing the 11,000-acre gift into
seven conservation easements to be signed over to the Nature
Conservancy by the end of June.</TE>
<TE>   Only one has been recorded so far. Records on the so-called Laguna
Laurel easement, 173 acres in Irvine near Laguna Canyon Road, show
the Irvine Co. has reserved the right to send urban runoff from an
adjacent new development across the preserved land.</TE>
<TE>   A similar tactic led to costly delays a few years ago for the
company on its upscale Newport Coast development, after the state
Coastal Commission questioned rights the company had retained to
drain runoff across Crystal Cove state park when it sold the parkland
to the state.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are no immediate plans to put in utility lines and
roads, the company also has reserved rights to do so, and even
conduct "slant" drilling under the site from adjoining lands.</TE>
<TE>   Company and Nature Conservancy officials said the impact and size
of any such construction would be extremely limited and would require
approval by appropriate government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Small called the runoff, roads and other rights "novel."</TE>
<TE>   He said the "first line of defense" in monitoring a landowner's
compliance with conservation values is the designated environmental
group that is the recipient of the easement.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, that group is the Nature Conservancy, which is being
paid $20 million by the Irvine Co. to manage all its open space.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime activist Sherry Meddick said possible roads through the
open space in east Orange, along with other new roads and development
nearby, will destroy essential wildlife corridors.</TE>
<TE>   "The mountain lions are going to need a road map and crossing
guards," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Trish Smith, senior biologist in Orange County for The Nature
Conservancy, is overseeing the gift land. She expressed concern over
roads that might be built in easement areas. But she said the
proposed development nearby would not block wildlife corridors.</TE>
<TE>   She said studies had shown mountain lions and other animals
primarily move through the lands that are being set aside.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'd been asked a year and a half ago what was needed [for
wildlife corridors], these are exactly the lands I would have
selected," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Florian said the Irvine Co. does not necessarily think new roads
needed to be built on the gift lands. But, because of concern by some
local officials about increasing traffic, she said, the company
didn't want to rule out the possibility of building any previously
planned roads.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the final language and tax deductions of the easements,
the company will finally find a use for some swaths of land that, on
the books, are worth as little as $1,300 an acre. It would probably
cost hundreds of millions of dollars to even prepare the tangled
virgin wilderness in steep, narrow canyons for construction.</TE>
<TE>   "It's mostly 'hilly-to-waste' category land. It goes straight up,"
said the Orange County tax assessor's managing appraiser Steve Grimm,
of 900 acres known as Fremont Canyon that are part of the land being
set aside. "It's almost impossible to build on."</TE>
<TE>   Although the property may not be worth much on the books, the
inability to bulldoze or otherwise touch it has left a treasure trove
of wildlife. From golden eagles and mountain lions to spadefoot
toads, newts and seven species of bat, the land is full of rare and
endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   Nature Conservancy of California director Graham Chisholm said
that, whatever the tax ramifications might be, the gift brings an
important additional layer of protection.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that there is now a conservation plan is a huge plus,"
he said. "You can sleep better at night."</TE>

<HD>Cityhood Is the Talk of Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Secession: Issue piques residents' interest as decision on
possible ballot measure nears.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These days, there's a new buzz on the streets of Hollywood, and it
has nothing to do with who might walk away with an Oscar come March
24.</LD>
<LD>   It's about the possibility of a November ballot measure by which,
if successful, Hollywood could secede from Los Angeles and become its
own city once again.</LD>
<LD>   "The L.A. City Council is not concerned about Hollywood,"
construction worker Glenn Davis said as he puffed on a cigarette at
Wilcox and Selma avenues the other day. "We've been under the L.A.
City Council's thumb for far too long. I've known about this
[secession] for a couple of years. I thought it was just pie in the
sky, but now that it's economically feasible, let's go.</LD>
<TE>   "Like our president likes to say, 'Let's roll.'"</TE>
<TE>   Like the 40-year-old Davis, a lot of Hollywood residents and
workers were full of opinions in the wake of a government report last
week that concluded that Hollywood would be financially viable as a
city separate from Los Angeles, which it has been part of since 1910.
A final decision is expected shortly on whether the measure on
Hollywood will appear on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes sense," Adam Rose said while visiting the Hollywood
regional library. "It's a big enough town that it doesn't need to
rely on L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Graphic designer Ricardo Marenco, who works in Hollywood, added,
"They really should be separate from Los Angeles. That'll clean up
the neighborhood, that's for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Others were just as vocal about keeping Los Angeles whole.</TE>
<TE>   Julio Hernandez, the manager of a clothing store on Vermont
Avenue, said if Hollywood becomes a city, it might set off a chain
reaction of other communities attempting the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always been Los Angeles," said Hernandez, 35. "We should
always be Los Angeles. There is no need to change that."</TE>
<TE>   Mher Tavidian, owner of the Dziner Sign Co. on Sunset Boulevard,
said he would "definitely be against" secession if it came to a vote.
The Glendale resident's business has been in Hollywood since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's better if we stay a part of a greater entity that is
L.A.," Tavidian said. "Economically, in every way I can think of, it
benefits from being a part of the city."</TE>
<TE>   Some residents didn't feel Hollywood could survive as an
independent city.</TE>
<TE>   "If they [Los Angeles] take their own power and water, they can go
on," said James Hall, 49. But would Hollywood survive?</TE>
<TE>   Hall also worried that the powerful movie industry might end up
having too much say in the new Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "The big interest groups, the movie industry, they would be
roaming all over this place, romping and stomping like they own it,"
Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   Still others didn't know anything about the secession.</TE>
<TE>   One resident of the Fairfax district--a portion of which lies in
the proposed new Hollywood--said he has heard little about it. But he
wanted to know more.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to be misled," said 33-year-old Gregory Beylerian, an
artist. "There are issues about running a city. It's not easy. You
have to know what the benefits would be to be your own city versus
not."</TE>
<TE>   The recent findings about Hollywood in the study by the Local
Agency Formation Commission remind some that Hollywood was once a
separate city.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1883 by Kansas transplants Horace H. Wilcox and his
wife, Daeida, the area was to be a haven for temperance advocates.
They wanted no saloons. They offered free lots to anyone who would
build churches there.</TE>
<TE>   When it was incorporated in 1903, one year after Horace Wilcox
died, Hollywood had a population of about 700.</TE>
<TE>   The city of small wooden bungalows, open fields and citrus groves
was consolidated with Los Angeles in 1910 to ensure a larger supply
of water. At that time, Hollywood's population had swelled to about
4,000.</TE>
<TE>   The 1920s heralded a new era for Hollywood as film studios began
to line Sunset Boulevard and Melrose Avenue, while Hollywood
Boulevard became its major thoroughfare. New housing tracts, hotels,
restaurants and studio facilities opened.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of that decade, Hollywood's population stood at 50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, some chafed that Hollywood--the world's film
capital--was lost in the shuffle of a sprawling megalopolis that L.A.
had become.</TE>
<TE>   They said that downtown officials were slow or unable to respond
in a timely manner when Tinseltown's fortunes soured in the late
1960s as runaways flocked to its increasingly seedy streets. Drugs
and prostitution were chronic problems. And businesses started to
close.</TE>
<TE>   When Hollywood's biggest booster, Johnny Grant, persuaded U.S.
postal officials to officially change the "Los Angeles" postmark on
letters to "Los Angeles/Hollywood" two years ago, it made sense to
old-timers like Larry Benson.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time," Benson, a longtime studio soundman, said the
other day. "We're due a little respect for helping out Los Angeles
the way we do. Maybe we'll get more respect if we become our own
city."</TE>
<TE>   However, some Hollywood boosters are, for now, steering clear of
stating opinions on the area's future.</TE>
<TE>   They are the officials of groups such as the Hollywood Business
Improvement District, a merchants and business group that voluntarily
taxes its members to promote Hollywood Boulevard and provide other
services.</TE>
<TE>   Since the group was allowed to be formed by a Los Angeles city
ordinance, Kerry Morrison, the district's executive director, said
the group would have to research whether it could remain in existence
if Hollywood becomes its own city.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that we've read that there's a good chance it'll appear on
the November ballot, it behooves us as a business district to
aggressively evaluate what it means for us," Morrison said.</TE>
<TE>   Leron Gubler, president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, took
a similar line, but added that he expected the organization to take a
position on the proposed secession.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, a survey indicated that most chamber members either
opposed or had no opinion about Hollywood cityhood, Gubler said,
noting, "A lot of people didn't take it as a credible effort."</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, the chamber will study the pros and cons. To
succeed, a secession measure would have to be approved by a majority
of Hollywood voters and a majority of voters citywide.</TE>
<TE>   One secession supporter says the cityhood campaign will be
difficult if the measure, as expected, is put on the November ballot
along with similar proposals for the San Fernando Valley and the
harbor area.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is time," said Joe Shea, president of the Ivar Hill
Community Assn. "It's March right now. You can't mount a major
campaign like that in six months. It's no small thing to persuade the
voters in Hollywood and the voters in Los Angeles that Hollywood
ought to go its own way. I think we need more time to examine the
issues."</TE>

<HD>Civil Cases to Focus on Liability in Dog Attack</HD>
<DH>Lawsuits: Deciding who is financially responsible for fatal
mauling could affect landlords, pet owners, insurance firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From his office in Redwood City, attorney Rick Williams is keeping
close tabs on the Los Angeles trial of two San Francisco lawyers
charged in the fatal dog mauling of their neighbor.</LD>
<LD>   When the criminal case of dog owners Marjorie Knoller and Robert
Noel is resolved, Williams will have to defend his clients--the
owners of the apartment building where tenant Diane Whipple was
killed--against wrongful death civil suits filed by the victim's
partner and mother.</LD>
<LD>   The civil cases arising from the fatal mauling raise a difficult
question: Who should be financially responsible for dog attacks? That
answer could affect dog owners, property owners and the companies
that insure them. Since Whipple's death, many landlords have taken
steps to ensure tenant safety by controlling the pets in their
buildings. But rental laws in San Francisco make it difficult to
evict tenants with problem pets.</LD>
<TE>   To win involuntary manslaughter convictions in the ongoing
criminal case, prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
the defendants acted in a criminally negligent manner.</TE>
<TE>   To earn a civil judgment against a building owner, the plaintiff
must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the dog was
dangerous, the landlord knew so and could have either evicted the
tenant or required the tenant to remove the dog.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely difficult because the victim or survivor has to
prove what was in the landlord's mind," said Los Angeles attorney
Kenneth Phillips, who represents dog attack victims in criminal and
civil cases. "It's not enough that they should have known. It has to
be proven that they actually knew."</TE>
<TE>   The civil suit filed by Sharon Smith, Whipple's partner for seven
years, alleges that owners Rudolph Koppl and Annette Pucci-Koppl and
their management company, Marina Green Properties, had a "shocking,
willful and conscious disregard for the obvious danger that [the
dogs] posed to the safety of others," and that Whipple's death was
foreseeable and preventable.</TE>
<TE>   Though only surviving spouses, parents and children historically
have been entitled to sue for wrongful death in California, Smith
helped get legislation passed last year to extend those rights to
same-sex partners.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple was attacked Jan. 26, 2001, by two Presa Canario dogs in
the hallway outside her upscale San Francisco apartment. Knoller and
Noel are charged with involuntary manslaughter and keeping a
mischievous dog in connection with their neighbor's death. Knoller
also faces a second-degree murder charge and could be sentenced to 15
years to life in state prison if convicted. Noel faces a maximum
sentence of four years.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller, 46, and Noel, 60, also have been sued for wrongful death.
That civil case against the couple will be easier for Whipple's
survivors to prove, because state law says dog owners are liable for
bites unless the victim was trespassing or provoked the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of Whipple's mauling reverberated throughout
traditionally pet-friendly San Francisco in the last year. Complaints
about dog bites to police and animal control rose dramatically, more
dog owners enrolled their pets in training classes and more landlords
attended seminars on how to deal with problem animals, according to
animal control officials.</TE>
<TE>   Apartment owners statewide have the right to ban dogs from their
buildings, except for guide or service dogs for the disabled. About
75% of rental units in San Francisco forbid dogs, according to Rent
Tech, a rental referral service that lists most of the city's
vacancies. The percentage rose slightly following Whipple's death.</TE>
<TE>   "It is becoming more and more difficult for the good, big dog to
find a place in San Francisco to live," said Kat Brown, deputy
director of San Francisco Animal Care and Control, which runs the
city and county municipal shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Janan New, director of the San Francisco Apartment Assn., said she
provides landlords with a rental agreement for pets that requires
tenants to keep their pets under control and to cover any damages or
injuries caused by the pets.</TE>
<TE>   In most California cities, a landlord can evict tenants who
violate such an agreement. But in San Francisco, the rental laws make
it nearly impossible for landlords to do so, because having a
potentially dangerous pet does not qualify as a specific cause for
eviction, New said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all apartment building owners purchase insurance policies
that cover damages from dog attacks, said Pete Moraga, spokesman for
the Insurance Information Network of California. And every year,
insurance companies pay out $310 million nationwide because of dog
bites.</TE>
<TE>   There are 15 to 20 dog bite fatalities every year nationwide and
more than 300,000 bites send the victims to hospitals, attorney
Phillips said.</TE>
<TE>   Since Whipple's killing, more insurance companies have been
excluding from their policies certain breeds of dogs, such as pit
bulls and Rottweilers, or specific dogs with a history of violence,
Moraga said. "Whenever you have a very high-profile case, like this
one, it definitely has an impact on the way insurance companies look
at [dog liability]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Koppl family has insurance for the apartment building where
Whipple lived and was attacked, Williams said. But he declined to
discuss the specifics of his clients' policy.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Cardoza, who represents Smith, said the landlords' policy
is for $2 million to $4 million. "There is insurance here, and we
plan to go after it," he said. Cardoza said he doesn't know whether
Noel and Knoller had renter's insurance, but he said they are not the
"deep pockets" in this case.</TE>
<TE>   If the civil cases against the San Francisco landlords do go to
trial, attorneys said Whipple's death could elicit sympathy among
jurors and result in multimillion-dollar verdicts against the
landlords. The landlords and the insurance company could be
responsible for paying Whipple's survivors. The insurance company may
not renew the policy or may raise the rates if there is a large
verdict or settlement against the landlords, Moraga said.</TE>
<TE>   The case that set the law on landlord liability stemmed from a dog
attack in 1971 in Stanislaus County. A 5-year-old girl was seriously
injured after being bitten by a large German shepherd at a friend's
house. There were "Beware of Dog" signs posted on the yard and the
dog twice had bitten people. The friend's parents were renting the
house, so the girl's family sued the owners.</TE>
<TE>   A state appellate court ruled that the landlord could be held
liable because he knew about the dog's dangerous nature and he could
have evicted the family or ordered them to get rid of the dog.</TE>
<TE>   In a later Riverside County case, a cable installer was working at
a rental house when a German shepherd jumped on him, causing the man
to fall and break his back. Even though the landlord knew that the
tenant at the house had a dog named Thunder, he had never heard any
complaints about the dog and did not know it was dangerous. The
appellate court ruled in the landlord's favor.</TE>
<TE>   In the criminal trial resulting from Whipple's death, several
residents of the upscale, six-story building told jurors about their
own frightening encounters with Bane and Hera. They said the dogs
lunged, bit and charged.</TE>
<TE>   Only 1 Witness Reported the Dogs' Behavior</TE>
<TE>   But only one witness said he reported the dogs' behavior to the
apartment manager, in a letter that mostly complained about the dogs
making too much noise.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of complaints benefits the landlords' case, Phillips
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole community has shown up at court to talk about the dogs
in hindsight," he said. "But there were no police reports, no animal
control reports, no insurance claims, no lawsuits and no letters to
the landlord."</TE>
<TE>   Williams said his clients could not have anticipated the fatal
attack on Whipple. "If all these people who testified they were
afraid of the dogs had been that scared, why didn't they say
something to someone?" he said. "It's an unfortunate situation as can
be, but my clients aren't responsible for it. They didn't know the
dogs were dangerous or posed a threat to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Smith's attorney, Cardoza, said the landlords should never have
permitted the massive Presa Canario dogs into the building in the
first place.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do you allow two horse-type dogs into an 800-square-foot
apartment?" he said. "They are walking time bombs. It's not fair to
the animals ... it's not fair to the public and it's not fair
especially to the tenants."</TE>
<TE>   Ronald H. Rouda, who represents the victim's mother, Penny
Whipple-Kelly, said the fact that the dogs weighed more than 100
pounds each should have alerted the landlords to the potential for
harm. Rouda said the apartment manager should have confronted Knoller
and Noel and asked them to put muzzles or choke chains on the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who has set up a foundation in Whipple's name, said any
money she receives from her lawsuit will help fund it. Whipple-Kelly
said her goal is to prevent what happened to her daughter from
happening to anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter had a reasonable expectation to be safe in her own
apartment," she said. "Maybe other apartment owners will pay more
attention to what's going on in their buildings."</TE>

<DH>Education: Popular annual seminar in Westminster schools
provides guidance to moms and dads. Give respect to get respect, one
teacher advocates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hong Tran wants to know what to do about her daughter. The girl does
her homework with the television blasting, and a telephone seems
permanently attached to her ear, even when she's supposed to be
working on the computer.</LD>
<LD>   "I am the rock in the house," the Westminster mother said, "and
she wants to see how far she can push me."</LD>
<LD>   To learn how to avoid getting pushed any further, Tran, 47, went
back to school Saturday, to Parents' Academy at the Westminster
School District.</LD>
<TE>   The daylong annual event teaches parents how to help their
children; covering issues from discipline to reading to healthy
living. About 150 parents gathered at Neomia B. Willmore Elementary
School Saturday morning to attend workshops.</TE>
<TE>   They listened to speakers discuss bullying, how to get kids ready
for college and ways to motivate them.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the workshops were in Spanish, others in Vietnamese, and
many in English, with parents listening to translations over
headphones.</TE>
<TE>   Event coordinators said the workshops have become an indispensable
means of reaching parents in this increasingly diverse city. The
student body is 32% Asian, 36% Latino and 26% white.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't address language barriers, we won't have parent
involvement," said Adriean Tuzzolino, chairwoman of the Westminster
Community Collaborative, which sponsored the event.</TE>
<TE>   The collaborative is a network of local agencies, including the
school district, faith-based groups and family centers.</TE>
<TE>   To entice parents to come, organizers offered day care for about
40 youngsters, and 90 older children were sent to a Boys and Girls
Club next door where they played games and tackled many of the same
issues their parents were learning in the Parents' Academy.</TE>
<TE>   It was a new experience for Antonio Saucedo, 43, and his wife
Maria, 25, who immigrated from Michoacan, Mexico, eight years ago.
They have two children in the district.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was going to school in Mexico," Antonio Saucedo said in
Spanish, "there was nothing like this. I learned a lot today."</TE>
<TE>   So did Tran, the Vietnamese mother.</TE>
<TE>   She attended a workshop on discipline for teenagers given by Sue
Nettleton, a community day school teacher who handles some of the
most difficult students in the district.</TE>
<TE>   "It's OK to give reasons for your decisions, but not to negotiate
them," Nettleton told about a dozen parents in her workshop. The
children have to know, "I am not here to be your friend, I'm here to
be your mother."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Nettleton warned, "Don't treat them like
children, because they will do everything to prove they are not
children; they are developing adults ... If you don't show respect,
don't expect to get any respect back."</TE>
<TE>   Those words, translated into Vietnamese, registered with Tran.</TE>
<TE>   Her 12-year-old daughter, a seventh-grader at Dr. Russell I.
Johnson Middle School, doesn't always come straight home from school,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   So the mother turns to threats in the heat of the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Tran said. "I'll control my anger."</TE>

<LD>In defense of dumb blonds ...</LD>
<LD>   A 26-year-old Playboy playmate with an eighth-grade education
marries an uncommonly rich 89-year-old oilman. He dies a year later,
and she makes a claim to part of his fortune.</LD>
<LD>   You've already chosen sides, haven't you?</LD>
<TE>   Maybe that's what E. Pierce Marshall was counting on as he
contested Anna Nicole Smith's claim to part of his late father's
fortune. She was nothing but a gold digger, Pierce Marshall claimed,
and his father, J. Howard Marshall, had no intention of leaving any
of his estate to the former stripper with the Marilyn Monroe
fixation.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps you're thinking, "The poor old guy, taken to the cleaners
by the blond bombshell."</TE>
<TE>   I was too, until I read the 79-page ruling that federal Judge
David O. Carter issued last week in Santa Ana. Carter awarded Smith
$44.3 million from the estate, and then doubled it after finding that
Pierce Marshall and a family attorney tried to defraud Smith of her
rightful share.</TE>
<TE>   If you're keeping score at home, the former waitress from east
Texas who became a Playmate of the Year and a Guess jeans model
netted more than $89 million. Not bad for someone whose car was
repossessed about the time she met Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   Carter's narrative is wry and bristling. He didn't find that Smith
had undying love for her husband, who died in August 1995, but
neither did he find her to be a calculating temptress.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, Smith was looking for financial security for herself and
her son, and it came to her. "What he might lack in youth, vigor and
looks," Carter slyly wrote about Marshall, "he made up for with his
great wealth."</TE>
<TE>   Though the latter part of Carter's ruling becomes a blistering
assault on Pierce Marshall and attorney Edwin Hunter, it's the first
half that illuminates the human nature at the core of the case.</TE>
<TE>   The answers, Carter concludes, lay not in Smith's heart and soul
but in those of the aging oilman with the Yale Law School education
and the immense fortune.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, Marshall divorced his first wife. Later that year, he
remarried. Though Pierce Marshall was his father's best man, the
other Marshall son has said he believes his father and new bride had
had a long-running relationship during his parents' marriage.</TE>
<TE>   During that second marriage, Marshall met "Lady" Diane Walker. As
Carter wrote: "Feeling the need for a drink after a day at the
office, Marshall went to a strip joint.... Lady Walker was one of the
strippers who took everything off for [him] in return for his
generous dollar bills. Thus, at the age of 78, he began his pursuit
of Lady Walker."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall showered the stripper with gifts and cash, to the tune of
$2 million a year. The affair ended when Walker died in 1991 from
complications from a face lift.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall was devastated. He called her death the most tragic thing
that ever happened to him. Coincidentally, his second wife also had
died that year, after suffering from Alzheimer's disease.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Marshall bounced back quickly. Three months after Walker's
death, Marshall went to the afternoon strip show at Gigi's in
Houston. He repeated the pattern he had employed with Lady
Walker--this time with Anna Nicole.</TE>
<TE>   When she danced in front of him, he tried to grab her breasts. He
was 86. They had lunch the next day; he gave her $1,000 in cash, and
she quit her job. From then on, Carter found, he plied her with cash
and gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, in 1994, Smith had established her modeling
career and had become Playmate of the Year. Only then did she agree
to the last of Marshall's multiple marriage proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Carter had to determine whether Marshall intended to leave Smith
anything. In ruling that he did, Carter wrote, "Their lives were
intertwined in need, driven by greed and lust. Nevertheless, the
court is convinced of his love for her. [Marshall] referred to her as
the 'light of my life' and the lady that saved his life."</TE>
<TE>   As for Smith, Carter was more cautious. Marshall "used his money
to get [her] to fall in love with him, and in her own way, she loved
him."</TE>
<TE>   Smith testified for three days in Carter's court. "Her illiteracy
is striking," he wrote. Still, he ruled, her testimony was credible.</TE>
<TE>   Far from feeling sympathy for Marshall, Carter notes that he spent
much of his adult life writing off gifts to his mistresses as
business expenses, hiding and manipulating his assets and assiduously
avoiding paying income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Carter found that the blond bombshell made life fun
for the decrepit tax dodger and that he intended to make right by
her.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, she could have walked away, but I refuse to judge her.</TE>
<TE>   To the contrary, I'm cogitating: For $44 million, I'd marry an
89-year-old guy.</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Giuliani GOP's No. 1 Running Mate</HD>
<DH>Politics: Sept. 11 made the former New York mayor a
national icon and coveted supporter. Simon is top priority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who just six months ago
seemed at the end of his political career, has been transformed into
a leading Republican Party standard-bearer whose endorsements and
appearances are benefiting candidates nationally--particularly
California gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr.</LD>
<LD>   Before Sept. 11, Giuliani was criticized from the right and the
left; he was divorcing his wife, bunking with two roommates and
fighting prostate cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Today, Giuliani has been reborn as a hero. His support is coveted
by Republican and even some Democratic candidates. And he is using
his new influence to help steer money and media attention to friends
and allies, especially Simon, a longtime friend to whom Giuliani has
devoted more time and energy than any other candidate.</LD>
<TE>   "Cameras are attracted to Rudy like bees to honey," said Marshall
Whittmann, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a conservative
analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a dozen cameras greeted Giuliani and Simon Saturday as
they campaigned in Hollywood. They were at each other's sides all
morning, among the shawl-wrapped Hasidic men of the crowded Chabad of
Hancock Park and later strolling through Canter's Deli.</TE>
<TE>   In the synagogue, Giuliani told the congregants that Simon is "a
truly exceptional person who has the same values that you do, just in
a different tradition."</TE>
<TE>   At Canter's, he pledged to do anything Simon wanted. "I've
enlisted in his army," Giuliani said.</TE>
<TE>   That was the latest in a series of joint appearances and ads that
Simon and Giuliani have produced, and their effect upon the
electorate has been notable. In a Times exit poll, 30% of those who
voted for Simon last week said Giuliani's endorsement was a major
influence on their decision.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani's new national role has implications for himself and his
party. It keeps him in the public eye at a time when there is no
obvious next step politically for the former New York mayor--and it
translates his Sept. 11 heroism into a marketable GOP asset.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts caution that no endorsement--not even one from
Giuliani--can make a winner. Indeed, several of the politicians he's
endorsed since Sept. 11 have lost. But Giuliani's presence next to a
candidate draws money, credibility and a reflected glow that few
politicians can deliver. And it can nudge swing voters, including
Californians who may be bothered by Simon's antiabortion,
anti-gun-control views--two topics where Giuliani's stands are more
moderate than those of his endorsed candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were Bill Simon, who would I like to have wrap their arms
around me?" asked Charles Cook who publishes the nonpartisan Cook
Political Report in Washington. "For a Republican conservative in
California trying to mainstream myself as quickly as possible ...
Rudy Giuliani and Colin Powell would be my choices."</TE>
<TE>   Although Republicans don't like to use the word, Giuliani has
become a celebrity, eclipsed only by the president himself and former
First Lady Nancy Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday night, Giuliani sat with the former first lady at a
$1,000-a-plate Reagan Presidential Library Foundation fund-raiser
dinner in Beverly Hills. Giuliani, the main speaker, was presented
the Reagan Presidential Foundation's Ronald Reagan Freedom Award.</TE>
<TE>   An Award-Winning Backer Shares the Glory</TE>
<TE>   That gave Giuliani his chance to bask in the recognition, but he
also parlayed the moment into a strategic advantage for a friend:
Bill Simon sat at the table with him.</TE>
<TE>   Their appearance there comes as Simon is pivoting into his general
election contest against Gov. Gray Davis. And Simon's upset victory
in the primary--he gained nearly 50 points in some polls over a
three-month period against the far better known former Los Angeles
Mayor Richard Riordan--was in large part attributable to Giuliani's
help.</TE>
<TE>   During the primary, the 57-year-old former New York mayor
campaigned on two days in January in California for Simon and cut
four commercials for the candidate.</TE>
<TE>   He returned in February, showing up with Simon at a sold-out
luncheon in Newport Beach. And in Sacramento, they descended from an
airplane to the theme song from "Top Gun" and the cheers of a
boisterous rally.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani intends to keep up those appearances for Simon through
the general election, said Bruce Teitelbaum, the managing partner of
Giuliani Partners, a business consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   "He's made a decision that he is going to do as much as he can for
as many people as he can, but of course he has time constraints,"
Teitelbaum said, adding that Giuliani juggles work, a personal life
and speaking engagements. He's also received dozens of requests to
speak at university commencement events, Teitelbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   Since leaving office, his most high-profile campaign help has gone
to Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill is very special," Giuliani said Saturday. "The endorsement
of Bill is obviously political. We're both Republicans. [But] he's
someone I worked with in the U.S. attorney's office. I watched him
handle cases against the Mafia.... I'm one of the people who
encouraged him to run a year and a half ago, when this seemed
impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Although Simon stands out, Giuliani also has traveled to Georgia
for one candidate, and more than a dozen others have requested his
help.</TE>
<TE>   "I have on my desk right now about 17, 18 requests from 14
different states--from the South to the West to the Northeast,"
Teitelbaum said. Half of those seeking help, he said, are
congressional candidates. A couple are incumbent senators. And two
are Democrats--one running for Congress, another for mayor--who face
non-Republican opponents.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of Giuliani's support in some races is hard to discern
precisely, but analysts say he brings stature, along with exposure
and money.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few politicians have coattails," Whittmann said. "What he
does is he legitimizes a candidate."</TE>
<TE>   In office, he added, some of Giuliani's biggest problems were with
conservatives who opposed the mayor's relatively liberal social
agenda. Now, however, "Conservatives are seeking his support because
he gives them credibility among swing voters--moderates, people in
the middle with weak party identification," Whittmann said.</TE>
<TE>   GOP Liberal Now Sought by Conservatives</TE>
<TE>   Although Giuliani is lending support to some candidates, his aides
and others note that he has been careful not to squander his impact.
His appearances are thoughtfully chosen. So far, consultants say, he
has not been the kind of political star who shows up at one cocktail
party for one candidate and then goes on to a dinner for another
candidate in the same city on the same night.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see him out there a lot, everywhere for everything," said
Anne Dunsmore, a professional Republican fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   Teitelbaum said that although the requests for help are
flattering, Giuliani approaches the solicitations as a chance to
build party solidarity and nurture alliances with colleagues across
the country.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Giuliani is rapidly building a list of people who owe
him a favor, "picking up chits for the future," said Whittman.</TE>
<TE>   But what of Giuliani's future?</TE>
<TE>   "I think people will always have a warm and fuzzy feeling toward
him, a respect," said Cook. But he and others agree that Giuliani's
drawing power could dwindle in a year or two.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an ADD nation," said Cook.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the former mayor's sway over voters, reporters and donors
may fade as the events of Sept. 11 recede further into history. That
could affect Giuliani's influence on races such as Simon's and could
temper his political ambitions, which for now are thwarted by the
lack of any obvious office to seek.</TE>
<TE>   "He's all dressed up with no place to go," Cook said. "He's not
going to run for governor against [George] Pataki." The New York
governor is seeking his third term.</TE>
<TE>   "No Senate seat opens until 2004," when Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.)
would be up, he added. "And Chuck Schumer is not going to be the
easiest person to beat."</TE>
<TE>   There is, of course, the presidency itself. But Americans
historically have been skeptical of New York mayors for the nation's
highest office, and in any event, the White House already is occupied
by a Republican who will almost certainly seek reelection in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani would not discuss his ambitions Saturday. And Dunsmore
says he should keep it that way; the uncertainty only enhances
Giuliani's influence and draw for other candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "Keeping your visibility is keeping your options open," she said.
"You never ever want to have all your eggs in one basket."</TE>

<HD>Melissa Gilbert Is Elected to Lead SAG</HD>
<DH>Labor: The former 'Little House' star easily defeats
'Rhoda's' Valerie Harper in a fractious election rerun. Now, she
faces job of healing the union.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES and RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After trouncing fellow 1970s TV star Valerie Harper on Saturday in
balloting for president of the Screen Actors Guild, actress Melissa
Gilbert now faces the daunting task of trying to heal a union whose
bitter election mirrored its chronic infighting.</LD>
<LD>   Gilbert, whose election in November was nullified because of
alleged election irregularities, received 21,351 votes, or 56.6%, in
the rerun election, compared with Harper's 12,613, or 33.4%. The
turnout was a record for a SAG presidential race. Two other
candidates, Angeltompkins and Eugene Boggs, pulled in slightly more
than 3,000 votes combined.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very upset we had to go through this again," Gilbert said
early Saturday after learning of the results. "But the silver lining
is that so many members voted in this election."</LD>
<TE>   Gilbert, 37, said the election clears the air at SAG, allowing its
top officials to resume trying to tackle the union's problems,
including an effort that starts in May in which the union will insist
that producers hire actors under SAG contracts even when filming
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement after the results were made official, Harper, best
known as Rhoda Morgenstern on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and
"Rhoda," did not mention Gilbert by name, but thanked supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "In this election--rerun in a fair and uniform manner--the real
winner is the democratic process," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an aggressive campaign, Harper, 61, was unable to convince
members that her opponent allegedly was too cozy with agents, studios
and other Hollywood unions at SAG's expense.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert's margin of victory far exceeded what it was in November,
when she pulled in 45.3% of the vote compared with Harper's 39.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Starting at noon Friday, the vote count had been expected to end
early in the evening. But the pace inside the James Cagney boardroom
at SAG's Mid-Wilshire headquarters was clearly slowed by the
avalanche of votes.</TE>
<TE>   The 37,742 ballots cast represented more than 41% of the members
eligible to vote, nearly double the typical turnout for most SAG
elections.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, counting was slowed by some equipment snafus and
extra caution by election officials wanting to make sure there was no
repeat of November's controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert's election to the two-year term wasn't formally announced
until shortly after 1 a.m. Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We erred on the side of caution to make sure this was perfect,"
said Ira Sidowsky of Optimum Solutions Corp., which designed the
technology used by the American Arbitration Assn., which oversaw the
election.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the campaign had deteriorated so badly into
name-calling by supporters of each side that one prominent actor,
James Cromwell, likened it to "a cat fight." At one point, Harper
supporter Elliott Gould called actor Mike Farrell, a Gilbert
partisan, "a slug" during a rally.</TE>
<TE>   The wounds may not easily heal, presenting Gilbert with perhaps
her biggest challenge in ensuring that actors are well represented
amid the continuing corporate consolidation of the entertainment
industry.</TE>
<TE>   SAG's factional disputes frequently have been played out messily
in public. "You don't even have to watch the soap operas anymore,"
said actress Tess Harper (no relation to Valerie Harper). "Just read
about SAG."</TE>
<TE>   The new election, which cost about $115,000, produced an identical
outcome to November's vote, which many SAG members argued was
unnecessary to rerun. In two other races, Gould again was elected
recording secretary and Kent McCord won again for treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert, best known as Laura Ingalls in "Little House on the
Prairie," was two months into her term as president of the
98,000-member guild when a SAG elections committee upheld a challenge
from Harper and other members who complained that last fall's vote
was tainted.</TE>
<TE>   The committee ruled that the integrity of the election was
compromised when New York members were given two extra days to vote,
and ballot envelopes sent to New York members contained no signature
lines. The company hired to run that election was dismissed and SAG
employees were publicly chastised for their actions.</TE>
<TE>   But Gilbert supporters countered that the decision to overturn the
election was really a coup attempt by Harper supporters, including
the committee that scrapped the results.</TE>
<TE>   Led by former "MASH" actor Farrell, Gilbert supporters immediately
pounced on the decision and made it the central campaign issue.</TE>
<TE>   They dubbed Harper's camp "the refuse to lose ticket," arguing
that the violations were inconsequential, that the election followed
past procedures and that Gilbert's victory was fair and unaffected by
the extra two voting days given New York members. Gilbert backers
petitioned the Department of Labor to overturn the decision to scrap
the election. Though the department is still investigating, the issue
is presumably moot, given Saturday's outcome.</TE>
<TE>   A volunteer position, SAG's president is the most visible face in
Hollywood representing actors. Past presidents have included Charlton
Heston, Patty Duke, James Cagney and Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike the days when those actors headed SAG, the union today
is a balkanized collection of actors with varying interests,
including stars, middle-class actors who work sporadically, dancers,
stunt people and background actors. Roughly nine out of 10 actors are
unemployed at any given time, and most don't earn a full-time living.
Thousands more SAG members perform infrequently or no longer act at
all.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a large bureaucracy with a staggering 107-member
board also has burdened the union. SAG has been aggressively trying
to reorganize more efficiently, recently agreeing to a plan that will
eventually trim its board size to 69 members.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Hollywood labor leader Brian Walton, SAG's chief
negotiator in last year's contract talks with studios and a former
Writers Guild of America executive director, said SAG's volatile
board needs to take the initiative in trying to heal the union.</TE>
<TE>   "It needs to be in sync, and the board needs to come together," he
said. "It needs some sort of plan for unity. It can't work if people
are going to pound on each other and accuse each other of wrongdoing
and evil."</TE>
<TE>   Harper had tried to make a heated campaign issue out of a
tentative agreement between SAG and agents that would allow such
things as limited investments by advertising companies in talent
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, which Gilbert supports and helped negotiate, includes
financial sweeteners in the form of money for SAG's health and
pension fund, a commitment to help battle runaway production to
foreign countries and establishment of a special fund for actors
whose agents fail or misappropriate funds.</TE>
<TE>   Harper vehemently opposed the deal, arguing that it creates
conflicts of interest for agents. Saturday's election results clearly
bode well for passage of that agreement, which SAG's board will
consider Monday. Should it approve the agreement, the membership will
be asked to ratify the document.</TE>
<TE>   But given the recent rancor within SAG, and opposition by such
prominent actors as Richard Dreyfuss, nothing seems assured.</TE>

<HD>Rally Urges Three-Strikes Reform</HD>
<DH>Prisons: Marchers support a bill to require that the severe
sentences be given only for serious or violent crimes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opponents of California's three-strikes law took the first steps
Saturday in an effort toward reforming legislation they say
prosecutors have misapplied to target the poor, minorities and
nonviolent drug offenders.</LD>
<LD>   In a rally and march through Westwood, members of Families to
Amend California's Three Strikes bore placards and told stories of
friends and family members they say have been given life sentences
for petty theft, drug possession and other minor offenses.</LD>
<LD>   "It's cruel, it's unusual," said Robin Steffen, who said her
husband, John, got a sentence of life plus four years for possession
of half a gram of rock cocaine.</LD>
<TE>   "He's addicted, and all his offenses from day one were
drug-related," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Steffen, a recovering addict who has served seven prison terms,
said she was ordered to attend inmate-staffed firefighting camps as
part of sentencing three times, but was never offered treatment for
her addiction.</TE>
<TE>   Passed by ballot initiative in 1993 and enacted the next year, the
three-strikes law was touted as a get-tough solution to violent
crime. It requires sentences of 25 years to life for any offender
convicted of two serious or violent felonies who is convicted of a
third felony of any kind.</TE>
<TE>   In California, 340 people are serving 25-to-life for petty theft;
6,400 have received 25-to-life since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Marchers said they were drawing attention to a bill, AB 1790,
introduced by Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) to
mandate that strikes be given only for serious or violent crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "Change is going to come," Goldberg said after the march. "It's
going to come either at the hands of the people or the courts, and it
should come from the hands of the people because they may not like
what the courts come up with."</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court last month struck down 25-year sentences
imposed on two men convicted of petty theft, calling them "grossly
disproportionate." The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said it was
not overturning three-strikes, however.</TE>
<TE>   Several participants in the march said the intent of the law is
often thwarted by overzealous prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Marcher Fred A. Zullo said his mentally ill son faces up to 90
years in prison for making terrorist threats against the Ventura
County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Zullo said his son grew despondent after being diagnosed with
bipolar disorder in 1999, and left the threats on an answering
machine. "He was trying to commit suicide by cop, but he's never hurt
anyone," Zullo said.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd at the protest, estimated at about 200 by police, wound
its way through Westwood Village led by three costumed participants.</TE>
<TE>   One played the part of Gov. Gray Davis, a staunch supporter of
three-strikes. Another man, dressed as a prison guard, wore the logo
of the California Correctional Peace Officer Assn., a powerful
lobbying group. The third man wore a business suit, representing,
according to participants, a member of the "prison industrial
complex."</TE>
<TE>   The pockets and belts of all three men were stuffed with fake
money, and they walked in front of a rolling cage holding two young
African American men.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Lyon, who took a break from studying to watch the protest,
said he supports reform. "I think the nature of the law is stocking
our prisons with too many people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Others in the midday crowd, such as Eric Schirding, were critical
of the march.</TE>
<TE>   "How many strikes do you want?" he muttered as the procession
moved past. "I'm all for three-strikes," he said. "They may go to
jail for something small, but what are the other two strikes for?"</TE>

<HD>Point Fermin Lighthouse Kept Ships From Danger</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here at the southern tip of Los Angeles, on a rocky promontory
jutting into the Pacific where the fog swirls and the whales spout,
Los Angeles' first lighthouse has stood guard for 128 years, marking
the western boundary of the harbor.</LD>
<LD>   The Point Fermin Lighthouse stands as a relic of the region's
maritime past, a place steeped in true tales of hardy
lighthouse-keepers, among them several women, and of the lore of
rusted and rotted remnants of sunken ships that lost their way.</LD>
<LD>   Point Fermin was named by English navigator Capt. George Vancouver
in honor of Father Fermin Francisco de Lasuen, colleague of Father
Junipero Serra in building the California missions. The point has a
lighthouse today because of 20 years of incessant lobbying by Yankee
pioneer Phineas Banning, whose labors earned him the title "Father of
Los Angeles Harbor."</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't until the 1850s, during the Gold Rush, that California
needed lighthouses. In the decades before, Spain had barred foreign
ships from making landfall. But miners, politicians and
prostitutes--not to mention a goodly amount of supplies--began being
lost in a number of wrecks of ships bound for gold-crazy San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   So in 1852, Congress authorized 16 lighthouses for the Pacific
Coast, among them one on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, the
first to be lighted in 1854; and at Point Loma in San Diego in 1855.
Los Angeles' lighthouse would not be ready for nearly 20 more years.</TE>
<TE>   Land Disputes Prompt Lawsuits</TE>
<TE>   Banning began buying up coastal land in anticipation of a
deep-water port for landlocked Los Angeles. Some things don't change:
While Banning was busy trying to get Congress to pay for the harbor
and lighthouse, disputes that would extend to 78 different lawsuits
began heating up over who owned the land and what permits were
needed. Disgusted, a wealthy landowner and former Los Angeles mayor
named Jose Diego Sepulveda wound up selling the land to the city of
Los Angeles for $35.</TE>
<TE>   So the federal lighthouse ended up being built on San Pedro land,
in 1874. A multiprism lens mounted in brass, the recent invention of
Augustin Fresnel, was shipped from France at a cost of about $12,000.
The light was fueled first by lard and coal oil, then by kerosene,
and finally, more than 50 years later, by electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Mary L. Smith was the first to take the $700-a-year federal job as
lighthouse-keeper, in 1874. She and her sister, Helen, listened to
the waves crash on the rocks below and the cry of the gulls overhead
as they maintained the 2,100-candlepower oil-lamp beacon, which was
visible from 13 miles, on land and sea. Apart from the moan of the
foghorn that they also operated, and the occasional thump of a
luckless bird attracted to the light, they at first enjoyed the
tranquillity.</TE>
<TE>   But after bedding down for eight long years in the Cape Cod-style,
two-bedroom lighthouse with a 55-foot tower, the sisters packed up
and left. The utter loneliness and isolation, along with a wind that
whipped along the bluff and chilled them to the bone during storm
season, finally took a toll.</TE>
<TE>   They were succeeded by a procession of keepers of the flame, known
as "wickies" for their skill in keeping wicks trimmed, fueled and
glowing. One of the most durable was Capt. George N. Shaw, who
succeeded the Smith sisters and held his position for more than two
decades, living in the lighthouse with his wife and daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Long-Ago Disaster Still Resonates</TE>
<TE>   On a sunny afternoon in 1888, the Shaws were watching the British
coal carrier Respigadera coming toward the shore when it stopped
dead, goring itself on a reef. The ship was forced out to deeper
waters and destroyed by dynamite. To this day, coal still washes
ashore after a southeast gale.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the white picket fence and garden, Shaw claimed he was
unable to keep either vegetables or chickens alive on the barren
headland. Vermin ate the seeds he planted. Weasels and badgers preyed
on the chickens.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1899, as the harbor population began to grow, Shaw had a
red-letter day as 14,000 Angelenos gathered near his lighthouse. As
President William F. McKinley symbolically pressed a button in the
White House, railroad cars dumped the first rocks to build the San
Pedro breakwater.</TE>
<TE>   At the turn of the century, developer George Peck dedicated land
adjoining the lighthouse property to create Point Fermin Park, less
for charitable reasons than to enhance his nearby Ocean View
subdivision. A park pavilion hosted Sunday dances and later roller
skating and boxing events.</TE>
<TE>   But when the beacon's circular, rotating light cast its searing
brightness into new residents' privacy, it triggered an early NIMBY
moment. They complained, and a half-lens was soon installed and
directed out to sea.</TE>
<TE>   In 1908, Angelenos flocked to the lighthouse to offer a rousing
welcome to President Theodore Roosevelt's 16 mighty warships, the
"Great White Fleet" commanded by Rear Adm. Robley D. Evans, "Fighting
Bob," who steamed into the harbor on the fleet's historic voyage
around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a decade later, former sea captain and cowpuncher
William L. Austin and his family moved into the lighthouse. His wife,
Martha Avila Bunce, a descendant of a prominent Spanish land-grant
family in San Luis Obispo, was a rebellious beauty who captured
Austin's heart. After they were married in 1897, Austin worked as a
lighthouse-keeper at Point Arena in Mendocino and at Point Conception
near Santa Barbara, two lighthouses without indoor plumbing.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking a better education for their children--not to mention
plumbing--the Austins moved to the Point Fermin Lighthouse in 1917.
Austin was paid $750 a year, while Martha received $300 a year as his
helper. Here, their eight children attended a nearby school and lived
in luxury, with indoor plumbing.</TE>
<TE>   The children disposed of kitchen garbage by tying a rope to one of
the younger boys, who clutched an armload of trash, then lowering him
about 100 feet below the cliff, where he left the trash to be
engulfed by the sea. As a joke, the boy once untied himself and
retied the rope to a bush, then watched as his siblings tugged vainly
on the rope trying to pull him up.</TE>
<TE>   On March 1, 1921, the Austin family watched as the Coast Guard
towed a German U-boat out to sea off Point Fermin and a destroyer
lobbed shells into it before it sank--part of Germany's compliance
with treaties that had ended World War I nearly three years earlier.
The submarine's propeller was later salvaged, melted down and poured
into souvenir paperweights, according to Steve Lawson, a researcher
with California Wreck Divers. But 25 pounds of unexploded TNT still
remain aboard the U-boat, which now cannot be found, Lawson said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1925, Martha Austin died unexpectedly; her husband died three
months later, heartbroken. Maintaining her family tradition as keeper
of the light, 24-year-old Thelma Austin applied for her father's job.</TE>
<TE>   "Why, the sea and this lighthouse seem to me like a holy shrine,"
her letter of application stated. She got the job.</TE>
<TE>   Her sister, Juana, eloped with a sailor a short time later, and
several of the other siblings joined the Navy. Thelma was alone there
in 1926 when the steamer David C. Meyer went aground. She radioed for
help, and no lives were lost.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity Ends Keeper's Role</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, the final changeover to electricity increased
the beacon's visibility to 18 miles--and signaled the end of Thelma's
job.</TE>
<TE>   Her duties were reduced to a flick of a switch. She supplemented
her federal income with a daytime job at a dentist's office in
Wilmington.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, blackout
warnings along the Pacific Coast forced the Point Fermin Lighthouse
to extinguish its beacon--forever, as it turned out. The Navy soon
moved in and used the lighthouse as an experimental radar station.
The lens and equipment were removed, and would soon surface in the
window of a Malibu real estate salesman who to this day refuses to
give them up.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, the lighthouse stood useless. The U.S. Coast Guard
instead mounted a utilitarian airport-style beacon on a plain pole
several yards away. The beacon was cheap, efficient, oh so
governmental--and devoid of romance. In 1948, Los Angeles regained
possession of the lighthouse and turned it into a residence for a
park maintenance supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   The nationally designated historic landmark was restored in the
early 1970s in time for its 100th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   It is the one-acre centerpiece, owned by the Coast Guard, of Point
Fermin Park, which is maintained by the city's Parks and Recreation
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Austin McKinzie, a schoolteacher and granddaughter of the
former lighthouse-keepers, is a member of the Point Fermin Lighthouse
Society, a citizens' group spearheading a project to turn the empty
lighthouse into a living-history museum. At present, the grounds are
open to the public but the interior is not.</TE>
<TE>   Although the impressive beam that once swept the land and cast a
glow for miles in all directions is gone, the lonely outpost can
still evoke powerful images of California in the age of sailing and
steamships.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Letter From New York" (by Eric Pape, Feb. 17), Pape describes a
city that is depressed, shellshocked and hemorrhaging residents by the
bucket load. I'm sorry to contradict his missive of doom and gloom, but
nothing could be further from the truth. I live a few miles from the
former World Trade Center, and I admit that the first month after Sept.
11 was rough. But things are better now.</LD>
<LD>   I know of one person who left Manhattan after the terrorist attack. He
was a British ex-pat, and he had just broken up with his girlfriend and
was unemployed. So he probably would have left anyway. Everyone else I
know is still living in New York--living and going out to dinners and
nightclubs and doing good work and having sex and watching movies and
reading books and going for walks in the park and all of the other things
that people do who live in dirty and lovely New York City.</LD>
<LD>   New York is a proud city. We've endured something of unspeakable
horror. And now we're thriving again. We might occasionally gasp and feel
the wind knocked out of us when we recall what happened on Sept. 11, but
we're not whimpering in corners licking our wounds.</LD>

<HD>James Turrell: Exhibitionist or Artist?</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>According to the article on James Turrell ("At Play With Night and
Day in the Desert," by Wade Graham, Feb. 17), art is an expression of
"faith in the possibility of liberation through a deep experience of the
world." Really? Whose experience and whose world? Do we have to destroy
the world to save it? What I see in Turrell is arrogance and hubris of
the highest order. His $20-million Roden Crater project is an appalling
desecration of nature and a waste of money. Is it a coincidence that it
overlooks "the haunting expanses of the Painted Desert, adjacent to the
Navajo and Hopi reservations"? Surely it is an insult to our Native
American neighbors, who respect and honor the earth. It also speaks
volumes about the foundations that throw money at this senseless
exhibitionism. I'm an art lover, but the $20 million could have been used
to create art centers for children and other public projects that enrich
the community, promote creativity and enhance the public sphere.</LD>

<TE>   At last, an update on brilliant James Turrell's Roden Crater project.
After attending his MOCA exhibit during the early days of the Santa
Monica art scene, being awed by his giant aerial photos of the crater and
landscape, and buying the fine museum show catalog that featured them, I
developed a fascination with the  mind-bending earthwork in Arizona, a
place I hope to visit someday.</TE>

<LD>It was refreshing to read your "Home Design Issue" (Feb. 10). It
brought back old, fond memories of the original Sunday L.A. Times Home
Magazine that always featured the same quality and inspiration as your
issue. For the first time in ages, I truly enjoyed your magazine from
cover to cover. Can we expect more of this warm and inviting home-style
quality, or will it be back to more divisive political and controversial
issues that already clog the pages in every newspaper?</LD>

<TE>   It was with a sense of disquiet growing toward revulsion that I read
your issue-length veneration of the private spaces of mega-wealthy
Angelenos. The pictures of bathrooms that cost more than a modest house,
closets the size of boutiques, stacks of dozens of indistinguishable
sweaters and rows of virtually identical shoes said volumes more about
self-indulgence and purposeless wealth than it did about home design. In
the weeks after Sept. 11 our nation was racked by a question that we
since have abandoned: Why do they hate us? Flip through this issue again
with that question in mind, and perhaps you will find the glimmerings of
an answer.</TE>

<LD>The Feb. 17 magazine was incredibly elegant, starting with the
cover image of an incredible green crater. I was not aware what was
giving me so much pleasure as I leafed through the magazine until I hit
the photograph of the tree in "Lawn Alternatives" (by Susan Heeger). That
discontinuous palm shifts abruptly to the right to get out of the way of
the stream of words extending into the image. The crown of the tree is
actually taken from a lower angle to give an additional sense of height.
That stopped me. Cubism has always been its own reward. Then I went back
through all of the pages to enjoy the designer's inventions again, one by
one.</LD>

<LD>Los Angeles is the world capital of the two most influential mixed
blessings of the past 100 years, television and the automobile. Over time
I've managed largely to swear off the former. Swearing off the latter is
another matter in such a sprawling and public transit-challenged place as
this one.</LD>
<LD>   The miseries and unwisdoms of our enforced motoring are obvious. More
insidious is that, no matter how utilitarian we are, the sheer number of
hours we spend behind the wheel leaves us highly vulnerable to the
special wantonness of cars.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps you sense a confession coming.</LD>
<TE>   The cars I've driven have always been determined by income that, given
children, mortgages, etc., failed to fabulously exceed outgo. They were
old and/or frumpy and/or small and/or economical. I once owned a rattly
Volkswagen beetle whose back-seat foot wells became miniature swimming
pools whenever it rained. For a couple of years, I tooled about in a
10-year-old Saab I'd picked up for 900 bucks; it was so rusty that my
adolescent daughters made me drop them off a block from their
destinations. They called the car "The Swedish Meatball." The only new
cars I ever owned were a cramped and tinny Mazda sedan and a Honda Civic
that had no air conditioning, no automatic transmission and no power
steering.</TE>
<TE>   The car I drove across the country to a new life in Los Angeles could
not have been less "L.A." It was a used 1994 Mercury Sable, the very soul
of middle-class, middle-West, middle-age bland. It was, as though it
needed to be, gray. Gray on the outside, gray on the inside, gray in the
minds of restaurant parking valets, who invariably deposited it in the
next area code so it wouldn't devalue their eatery's image.</TE>
<TE>   For five years I drove it stoically, even proudly, around this
image-obsessed city. Mine was a classic example of what Aaron Ahuvia, a
management professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn and a scholar
of consumer proclivities, refers to as "people getting really attached to
their choices and their tastes because those things are, at a subtle
level, political, in the sense of social politics."</TE>
<TE>   Then, a couple of months ago, I acquired a large, fancy car, whose
name I am loath to mention (suffice it to say it's often top-rated in
what's called the "premier luxury" category). I want it on the record,
though, that I put up good fight trying not to acquire it.</TE>
<TE>   My friend, a Hollywood agent, wanted to get rid of the car, and
offered to sell it to me. "What would I do with a - - - - -?" I told her
righteously. "I'm not a - - - - - kind of guy." She asked me, then, to
help her sell it. So, I researched a fair price and put the car in the
classifieds and on the Internet. No calls. She lowered the price several
times. No bites. Finally, weary of seeing it sitting in her driveway
while she drove a new, more practical, conveyance, she begged me to take
it off her hands, and quoted a ridiculously low price.</TE>
<TE>   Let me emphasize the car is 7 years old, 8 if you consider
model-years. Also, I bought it for less than half of what a new
garden-variety smaller car costs. Also, if you look at it closely, you'll
see it has plenty of nicks and dings, my agent-friend being about as
careful with her cars as she is with her cell-phone minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, since acquiring my new ride, I've come down with a mild case of
schizophrenia about it.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, I'm relieved to feel less conspicuous when in the city's tonier
precincts. I also admit to experiencing acceleration exhilaration
whenever I press down on the gas pedal and the car's engine (one
automotive reviewer called it a "creamy V-8") surges into action.  It's
curious, too, how leather upholstery as soft and smooth as caramel
mousse; power seats and lumbar supports; church-like quiet, programmable
seat back-seat bottom-steering wheel configuration; a power tiltable
sunroof; and an automatic six-disc CD changer connected to a premium
sound system can grow on a person marooned in rush-hour creep on the San
Diego Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Not so gratifying is the thought that my creamy V-8 runs on high-test
gasoline, which only a few months ago was flirting with $3 a gallon for
full-serve. Or that, at a time when Americans ought to be rethinking our
dependence on Saudi Arabian oil, I'm now consuming more of it than ever.
Or that Corolla drivers might mistake me for the sort of ostentatious
swell I've always wished flat tires on.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Ahuvia sees in my situation a classic consumer dilemma: how
to harmonize wanting to feel frugal, prudent and responsible with wanting
to take la joie de vivre in a great big bearhug. "Let me make a
prediction," he says. "A Saab or a Volvo eventually will reconcile this
for you. They come from a good socialist country. They're low-emission,
safe, and good investments. For guilt-ridden liberals, they're the
perfect ride."</TE>
<TE>   I don't know about that. Wafting along in the expansive fluidity of
this present car, John Coltrane blowing mellowness at me from six
different directions, it's hard to imagine ever returning to The Swedish
Meatball.</TE>

<HD>A Disc Jockey's Notes on Camp</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARA SCHWARTZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Webster's defines "camp" as "something so outrageously artificial,
affected, inappropriate, or out-of-date as to be considered amusing." But
for disc jockey Chris Fabbro, host of KXLU radio's weekly "Camp Stop the
World" show, camp is a world view. Once a writer in Warner Bros. TV's
international marketing department, Fabbro now is an Inyo National Forest
employee on fire-lookout duty who commutes to L.A. to broadcast from the
Loyola Marymount campus, plumbing his vast collection of LPs for
"historical 'n' hysterical" nuggets ranging from Eartha Kitt to Phyllis
Diller to the soundtrack from the 1970s kiddie-TV program "Zoom."</LD>
<LD>   When is a record right for your show?</LD>
<LD>   Is it out of style? Is it about to go out of style? Are you
embarrassed to admit to your friends that you dance around to this stuff?
It's anything that might make a person roll their eyes, or make their
ears prick up in excitement. It has to have lost its luster. I wouldn't
play any of the boy bands right now. But in a couple of years . . .</LD>
<TE>   What makes camp camp?</TE>
<TE>   I can only go on what makes me giggle. I use the word "giggle" because
if you were to say "snicker," it wouldn't necessarily be camp. It's about
art and beauty being in the eye of the beholder.</TE>
<TE>   But there are things that everyone could agree on.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody would agree that early John Waters films are campy, and
Donna Summer is a pop legend. Anything that once might have had some
legitimacy, that now few people legitimize. Is camp a philosophy of life?</TE>
<TE>   If you look at drag from the '50s and '60s, it was a rebellion. Back
then, drag queens were serious about changing the world and upsetting
everybody's ways of thinking. We forget that anything that makes us laugh
isn't just a tension release--sometimes it's hard-core therapy. Drag now
[isn't] so much about statements; it's about having fun.</TE>
<TE>   Why was camp originally associated with gay men?</TE>
<TE>   When times were much more oppressive, people needed an outlet of
expression, and camp was one of the few legal ways to do that. When you
consider it was illegal to hold hands or kiss, let alone live like
spouses, there had to be ways your working stiffs and your poets and your
philosophers could express themselves.</TE>
<TE>   What's your most-requested song?</TE>
<TE>   One is "He'd Rather Be a Girl," by Ruth Wallis. The other is called
"Why Me, God?" by Modine Gunch, but everyone calls it by its refrain,
which you can't print. The rest are early '80s soundtrack songs, like
"Nine to Five."</TE>
<TE>   Was there a camp epiphany that changed your life?</TE>
<TE>   Much to my chagrin, in a group setting, I always laugh at things that
nobody else is laughing at. And it's always been like that. I don't know
why I have this skewed view of the world. I remember once I was with my
parents [at] a play, and during intermission I said, "I'm sorry that I'm
laughing when nobody else is laughing." My mother said, "Maybe learn to
laugh more to yourself." [But] my father was like, "The hell with that.
Laugh!"</TE>
<TE>   What can camp teach us?</TE>
<TE>   That question is campy.</TE>

<LD>Invited To: Women With Heart, a benefit auction of
celebrity-designed jewelry presented by Platinum Guild International and
Sotheby's at Sotheby's Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Vital Signs: "It's always been somewhat of a girlish fantasy to design
a piece of jewelry and work with my two favorite materials, diamonds and
platinum," says actress-about-town Thora Birch, though she wonders, "How
many variations of a heart can you do?" Well, 22, it turns out, each
conceived by a female celebrity and auctioned for that starlet's pet
cause. Birch has chosen Best Buddies, which aids the mentally disabled.
Britney Spears' faceted bead thingy, whose pendant displays a briolette
diamond, benefits the Britney Spears Foundation; Cameron Diaz's platinum
choker helps Adopt-A-Classroom; Gwyneth Paltrow's tiny diamond-encircled
heart with platinum chain benefits the Robin Hood Foundation. Tara Reid
recalls, "It didn't take that long. I drew a necklace." And, presto!
Thanks to one of the Rodeo-caliber jewelry makers who executed the
designs, her fetching studded heart with dangling rubies has made AmfAR
$4,600 richer.</LD>
<TE>   If I Can Just Call Your Attention To: "I don't think we've had this
much blond hair in the room since I've been here, at least this much
natural blond hair," goes the lead-off bon mot from Sotheby's auctioneer
Richard Wolf. Four pieces are auctioned live (the rest will be sold
online over the next few days.) Candy Spelling's creation fetches $5,000
for the John Wayne Cancer Institute, which she credits with saving the
life of her husband, Nielsen titan Aaron Spelling. "I'd have bid, but I
got her heart years ago, so what's the sense?" cracks the still-feisty TV
baron, patriarch of a Spelling presence tonight that also includes Randy
and Tori. "My heart is to benefit the N.Y. Fire and Police Widow and
Children's Benefit Fund," announces Kristin Davis. To drive the point
home, the "Sex and the City" kitten sports a member of Manhattan's Engine
Co. 23 on each arm--and she matches the $9,000 high bid. But
the-heart-that-broke-the-bank (at $21,000) turns out to be Catherine
Zeta-Jones'</TE>
<TE>   "Hope"--inscribed pendant (on a platinum chain pave set with fine
diamonds) to benefit Planet Hope. In Zeta-Jones' absence, Melissa Joan
Hart says a few words. Ironically, TV's Sabrina hasn't created any
jewelry herself ("I wasn't asked," she pouts, "and my name is Hart!").
Finally, and with some fanfare, Dylan McDermott of "The Practice" steps
up for a "surprise" auctioneer cameo. He spurs bidding to an
anticlimactic $5,500 for a Renee Zellweger, and then he's gone.</TE>
<TE>Celeb Quotient:</TE>
<TE>   The cream of the designing women--Britney, Cammy, Catherine Zeta,
Drew--only give their hearts. Others bring their bods as well.</TE>
<TE>Wow Factor:</TE>
<TE>   Sotheby's, with its above-Wilshire patio, could have real party venue
potential were   people not being directed to a  restroom four stories
higher.</TE>
<TE>Grazing Level:</TE>
<TE>   Sold on the shrimp pancake hors d'oeuvres and "carousel of caviar"
buffet; pass on the funky-tasting beef with Stilton and the take-out
boxes of bland Chinese chicken salad.</TE>

<HD>Living on the Wedge: When Platform Shoes Ruled Tinseltown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN COMPO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unfortunately, today's platform shoe devotees don't have Fred
Slatten's shop to clomp around in anymore. The premier platform designer
in '70s L.A., Slatten held court for more than 20 years in a former pet
store near Santa Monica and San Vicente boulevards. When he first opened
Fred Slatten Shoes in 1970, the area wasn't yet prime shopping turf, but
the shop got noticed--not surprisingly, since it was lit 24 hours a day,
with a rainbow of platforms spinning on turntables in the display
windows. "Before we knew it, we had a captive audience," he says.</LD>
<LD>   "There was every shape, every color," recalls Slatten aficionado Sally
Struthers, who wore Slatten creations as Gloria Bunker Stivic on "All in
the Family." "Leather, satin, marabou, glitter--you got one pair and you
couldn't stop."</LD>
<LD>   There were shoes with real goldfish in their wedges and live birds in
their heels. Shoes painted with city skylines or the faces of David Bowie
or Marilyn Monroe, shoes decoupaged and shoes diamante'd. There were also
boots. "Nancy Sinatra was our biggest customer," says Slatten, who worked
as a buyer for Bullock's and later as a wholesaler before opening his
store.</LD>
<TE>   Cher indulged; Sonny, too. Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand, Goldie Hawn,
Marvin Gaye and Lana Turner ("the only customer we kept the store open
late for") were all fans, Slatten says. "Then there was this little pudgy
guy who turned out to be Elton John," he laughs. "He bought every shoe we
ever made." Playboy playmates shopped by the passel. "Every centerfold
for 15 years wore our shoes. Barbi Benton wanted a pair that lit up, so
we powered them by batteries." Each sales assistant had an indivdually
decorated office--a Graceland for footwear. "Gene Simmons from KISS came
in a lot," Slatten says, "but I think he just liked our girls."</TE>
<TE>   The store closed in 1992, a victim of more conservative times.
Slatten, 79, free-lances occasionally but mainly indulges hobbies such as
detailing his sports car. His take on the current platform renaissance?
Today's platform, says Slatten, is "kind of gross looking. Our shoes
flattered the foot."</TE>

<LD>As a child, Blanca Apodaca was fascinated by the pinup girls
painted on the noses of fighter planes in photos collected during World
War II by her father, a veteran. Today the 31-year-old artist illustrates
children's books, but she also pays homage to those cheesecake ladies in
oil portraits of L.A. bohemians--dancers from the neo-burlesque Velvet
Hammer troupe, which then included designer Maria Basaldu and journalist
Hope Urban.</LD>
<LD>   The artist's pinup-style "Dream Girls" series celebrates cartoonishly
sexy babes in retro-style fantasy scenarios--decorated with tattoo art
motifs such as skulls and roses--and has been reproduced as a calendar
available on Apodaca's Web site, www.blancaapodaca.com. Apodaca
emblemizes a new phase in lowbrow, the raunchy upstart art movement that
gestated among surfers, custom car designers, cartoonists and tattoo
artists in postwar Southern California. Today Apodaca and other female
artists are reveling in the hot rods-and-hot-babes imagery long seen as
men's fantasy territory. "I know that, to some people, exaggerated
superhero female curves are sexist," says Apodaca, who grew up in El
Segundo, Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley. "But I see that as a
matter of [lowbrow] style, along with bulging eyeballs and impossibly
twisted cars."</LD>
<TE>   Robert and Suzanne Williams, the artist couple who co-founded lowbrow
art bible Juxtapoz magazine, encouraged Apodaca to submit the "Dream
Girls" paintings for "Hot Rod Mamas," a group show of female artists
March 16 at the Burbank store 8 Ball. The exhibit, which includes several
Apodaca works, showcases female lowbrow artists, who have often
participated in the alternative art scene more as cheerleaders, models
and girlfriends. Another benchmark is "Vicious, Delicious and Ambitious:
21st Century Lady Artists" (Schiffer Publishing), due later this year,
which features several Southern California lowbrow artists, such as Stacy
Lande, Liz McGrath and Suzanne Williams.</TE>
<TE>   While Apodaca thinks it's high time lowbrow's female talents won
exposure on the other side of the canvas, she acknowledges that their
output doesn't veer far from the genre's basic (some might say base)
joys. "Exaggeration is a major component of the appeal," says Apodaca.
"It's not about reproducing some comfortable reality."</TE>

<LD>Dave Kronen was an abstract painter moonlighting as a rare-animal
importer when his monitor lizard died. "The vet said he could tell me
what happened if I prepared the neck bone," he recalls. A local museum
instructed him how to skin, gut, boil and bleach the carcass, and the
emerging skeletal structure had an unexpected effect on Kronen. "The
shapes of the bones were abstract forms, and everything about them--the
texture, the holes, the way they were formed--meant something," he says.
"Everything about them had developed through time to do a usable
function."</LD>
<LD>    When the museum offered to buy the skeleton, Kronen's fate was
sealed. "I was an artist," he says. "I needed money, and this fascinated
me." Fortified with a supply of fatalities from California zoos, Kronen
launched a career preparing rare-animal bones for museums and schools.</LD>
<TE>    Twenty-five years later, Kronen happened upon a replica of an ancient
mastodon cast in foam that had been made for a golf course. It was a good
copy, Kronen thought, but he could do better. He made it his mission to
use his artistic skill to create synthetic skeletons with an accuracy
that had never before been achieved. Eight years later, Kronen Osteo/Bone
Clones nestles in a Canoga Park warehouse, where Kronen's 14 artisans and
craftsmen painstakingly cast, sculpt and paint replicas of rare-animal,
fossil and hominid bones. Kronen, 59, has developed new resins and
plastic which more closely resemble bones, as well as painting techniques
to "age" them more cunningly. His showroom is a charnel house filled with
skeletons of harpy eagles in mid-flight, "super crocs" in mid-snap and
snarling saber-toothed tigers poised to pounce. All hover with an eerie
sense of vitality. "We re-create the power of the animal," Kronen says.
"We give bones life."</TE>
<TE>    Kronen makes more than 350 products from nearly 2,500 individual
bones. Most of his business comes from institutions, but retail sales are
surprisingly brisk (prices can range from $5 for a shark tooth to $7,900
for a complete saber-toothed tiger). "Sharks are very popular," he says.
"Thank the Discovery Channel. And things with long fangs that are deadly
sell." His most popular product is that saber-toothed cat. "A lot of
lawyers buy them and put them on their desk," he says. Lawyers? "I think
because it's macho. Politicians, too. Fortune 500 executives. It makes a
great piece for your captain-of-industry type."</TE>
<TE>    Bone Clones also supplies the entertainment industry with everything
from fanciful alien skulls to crime victim remains for the TV show "CSI."
But speaking with Dave Kronen, you get the sense that making a living
comes second to his passion for the extra-credit rewards of making
artificial bones. "We're helping endangered species by reducing the
pressure on poaching," he says. "We're filling the gaps for people who
want to teach anthropology but couldn't because the materials weren't
there. My life is about revealing the unseen structure in things, and the
way things function. Bone Clones is my legacy."</TE>

<HD>The Indisputable Mr. Scruples</HD>
<DH>What to Some Might Seem a Little White Lie or a Trivial and
Necessary Compromise Is, to L.A.'s Michael Josephson and Other Secular
Ethicists, Figure-Skating Scandals, Enron and the Collapse of
Civilization as We Know It.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The audience on this weeknight at St. Genevieve High School in the
San Fernando Valley numbers no more than 250--mostly St. Genevieve
students and faculty and a handful of athletic officials from other
schools--but clearly Michael Josephson needs no added incentive to get
himself up for the occasion. Microphone in hand, suit jacket unbuttoned,
he paces across the matted gymnasium floor while delivering an
impassioned 20-minute prologue on America's declining sportsmanship.
Rivulets of sweat trickle down his face, and his fresh white dress shirt
has wilted by the time he turns his attention to the five panelists
seated at a dais behind him.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. women's national soccer team cheated in the final game
against China to win the 1999 World Cup, Josephson declares. On the
decisive penalty-kick block, goalkeeper Briana Scurry came off the end
line too soon, he says. She intentionally violated the rules and then
shamelessly boasted about it.</LD>
<LD>   Does anybody have a problem with that?</LD>
<TE>   This is hardly the genteel, cookies-and-punch demeanor we might expect
from the 58-year-old gentleman who delivers those 90-second entreaties on
virtue on KNX radio, who trades in the currency of goodness, whose life's
work for the past 15 years has been promoting virtue and raising the
level of human comportment. The self-styled ethicist's teddy bear
appearance is unimposing--5-foot-7, a little wide at the belt, fair skin
and hair, wire-rimmed glasses framing a round face--but the mind behind
that soft facade is deadly. Josephson's manner reveals the residue of his
earlier life as a university law professor skilled in the art of
interrogation. Partial to the Socratic method, he begins a dialectic
strip search of the panelists, sparing only the lone student, a St.
Genevieve football player rightfully terrified by the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   He requires but a few rounds of sparring to elicit agreement from
Marlon Archey, the school's soccer coach and athletic director, that
Scurry's crucial World Cup play was unsportsmanlike. But Archey was
thrilled with the victory anyway and would be thrilled to see his
goalkeeper at St. Genevieve make such a play.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm having trouble reconciling those things, Mr. Archey," Josephson
says in his scratchy voice. Then he turns his attention to Brother John
Montgomery, principal of downtown Los Angeles' Cathedral High School.</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose this is happening at your school, Brother John. Are you
thrilled, too?" Montgomery, the picture of rectitude in his black robe
and white collar, contemplates this hypothetical dilemma for a moment.
Like Archey, he was proud of the World Cup victory, never mind what
Briana Scurry did.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is why people don't like lawyers," Brother Montgomery
says. "If you're not careful," Josephson parries when the laughter and
applause die, "we'll show why they don't always like priests either."</TE>
<TE>   A risky quip in such Catholic company, but it goes over well enough.
Certainly nobody's bored. In short order the ethicist has everyone on the
ropes. Parent Tom Iaccino thinks the burden should lie with the
officials, and athletes should be coached to probe the limits of what
they can do without getting caught. Los Angeles Times sportswriter Eric
Sondheimer stakes out the same position.</TE>
<TE>   Josephson asks if it's all right for kids to cheat in the classroom as
long as the teacher doesn't catch them. Why don't we just drop the
pretense that you care about sportsmanship, he suggests, and authorize
coaches to teach athletes to get away with whatever they can? "Would you
be in favor of that, Eric?"</TE>
<TE>   Sondheimer rambles off in an unresponsive direction.</TE>
<TE>   "I must have been unclear with my question, since you obviously didn't
understand it," Josephson says, "so let me ask it one more time. The
question I asked you was--"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not answering the question," Sondheimer says</TE>
<TE>   . "And I'm not relenting in asking it."</TE>
<TE>   Josephson has made sportsmanship one of his focuses because he
believes that the values youngsters learn through sports influence their
behavior as adults. Before the evening closes, he has unflinchingly laid
out his case. Coaches bent on winning often fail to make the distinction
between playing hard and violating rules to gain an edge. Administrators
look the other way. The system tacitly endorses cheating. Is this the
message we want to send to our children?</TE>
<TE>   "You guys are so larcenous in your hearts," he says, "and you're
sitting in front of all these people here and saying, 'Aw, that's the way
sports is.' Is that the way it ought to be?"</TE>
<TE>   Josephson found his mission in life the way so many people do--
entirely by accident. He was contentedly teaching "the lawyerly
courses"--criminal law, criminal procedure, evidence, trial practice--at
Loyola Law School in Los Angeles in the mid-1970s when the American Bar
Assn., chagrined over having so many attorneys tarnished by the Watergate
scandal, required all accredited law schools to improve their ethics
instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola assigned Josephson to teach a course in the subject in 1976, so
he prepared by doing the obvious thing: He studied ethics. He remembers
taking his "standard approach, which was looking for loopholes and
ambiguities, which is the way I had been taught to do it." It was while
comforting his colicky infant son at 3 a.m., though, that this adroit
professor of obfuscation, witness manipulation and courtroom
deception--all widely practiced litigation techniques--was struck by a
sobering realization: "I wouldn't go about teaching my son ethics the way
I'm preparing to teach it in law school."</TE>
<TE>   That's how it started for Josephson. He volunteered to teach the
course every semester after that until he left academia in 1987. That
same year, he established the Joseph and Edna Josephson Institute of
Ethics, a nonpartisan, nonprofit education and outreach foundation named
for his parents and headquartered in a Marina del Rey commercial
high-rise. His staff now numbers 34, from writers and editors to program
managers, finance types, mail clerks and information technologists. But
Josephson is the franchise. "He's the jockey," says Tom DeCair, the
institute's special projects coordinator, "and the rest of us are
horses."</TE>
<TE>   Josephson, a 1960 Westchester High graduate, launched the organization
with $1 million of his own money, having realized 10 times that amount
from the sale of a national chain of bar-review courses he had formed
years earlier to provide his out-of-work father with a livelihood. Though
he works long hours as the institute's president and chief rainmaker,
bringing in about $500,000 a year through speaking fees and consultancy,
Josephson says he has never taken a salary.</TE>
<TE>   By now Josephson has gained a following through his radio
commentaries, which he recently began syndicating to markets outside Los
Angeles. Not long ago, he started offering free weekly packages of the
commentaries via e-mail. Within two months the subscriber list had
reached 20,000. The institute trains and certifies 3,000 to 4,000 people
a year to teach ethics using its "Character Counts!" program, which
Josephson says reaches more children--at least 3 million in more than
2,500 schools--than any of the numerous other character education
programs in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The institute also has become a prodigious publisher of books,
newsletters, videos, CDs and workshop training materials. Perhaps most
eye-catching, though, is the organization's list of past and present
clients, which ranges from Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pacific Bell, 3M and the
Los Angeles Times to the FBI, the CIA, the American Heart Assn. and the
California Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Josephson's quest may seem like a lonely one, this pitching of ethics
to a nation of individuals who don't especially like to be told how to
behave, but he is hardly laboring in isolation. A secular ethics movement
fomented by discontent with our national character has quietly evolved
and intensified since the mid-1970s, gradually finding a role in nearly
every niche of American society. Secular humanism, loathed by the
religious right for rejecting God, has been around for decades, but the
current phenomenon differs in that, while nonreligious, it has nothing to
do with atheism.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of its achievements surround us, from an increased emphasis
on ethics in university curricula to the presence of media ombudsmen,
ethics officers in business and nonprofit corporations, revived character
education in our schools, required ethics courses for public
officeholders and an ethics provision in federal sentencing guidelines.
An estimated 500 applied ethics centers that didn't exist 25 years ago
have been founded to promote moral thinking and decision making. Most are
on college campuses, many funded or endowed by individuals concerned
about humanity's future. In just the last two years, philanthropic
donations have created new ethics centers at Penn State, Arizona State
and Clemson University in South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   In the broadest terms, Josephson's goal is nothing less than to alter
America's moral trajectory by making ethics part of the national
conversation. Our indignation over the moral depravity of Sept. 11 and
the unfolding Enron scandal can only help, but even without the impact of
those events, we may finally be recovering from the quiet disillusionment
that began with Watergate. At the very least, we are better positioned to
address more than three decades of social decay marked by an
all-too-familiar list: drugs, violence, sexual laxity, family
disintegration, declining civility, educational malaise, surging prison
populations, civic noninvolvement.</TE>
<TE>   But pushing ethics is a tricky business. Just whose ethics are you
pushing, and what gives you the right to push them? Inevitably, the
ethicist reminds us of our own lapses and imperfections, which we don't
necessarily wish to contemplate. If the ethics of ancient Athens
prevailed today, we could simply give Josephson hemlock and be rid of him
and enjoy our World Cup victory in peace.</TE>
<TE>   While an undergraduate and law school student at UCLA in the 1960s,
Josephson was not an obvious candidate for the ethics business. Named
valedictorian in 1967 for all of the university's graduate schools, he
avoided reading his speech at the graduation rehearsal the day before the
ceremony for fear the administration would censor his criticisms of Los
Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty, California Gov. Ronald Reagan and Franklin D.
Murphy, UCLA's chancellor at the time. He has never affiliated with a
political party, he says, because, "I'm just too stubborn and a renegade,
and I don't like to accept anybody's prepackaged views."</TE>
<TE>   In his UCLA days he was loath to pass judgment on anyone else's views
either, having swallowed whole the precepts of moral and cultural
relativism. "I really thought that the only thing that was wrong was to
be judgmental," he says with apparent dismay. "I thought, 'They eat dogs
in Singapore, they burn widows in India. Who am I to judge?' I probably
reserved my most serious moral judgments for moralists."</TE>
<TE>   He was a product of the times.</TE>
<TE>   In his provocative 1987 book "The Closing of the American Mind," the
late University of Chicago professor Allan Bloom decried in plaintive,
angry rhetoric the rising tide of relativism in our institutions of
higher learning. The university ethos prized nonjudgment to a fault,
tolerance to the point of meaninglessness. Aloft with good intentions and
flower-child appeal, so-called values clarification blew in with the
1960s, was embraced by legions of students and professors in the 1970s
and 1980s, and even now has its disciples. It's the philosophical
equivalent of a shoulder shrug, which is one thing when Briana Scurry
cheats off the line in the World Cup finals but quite another when, for
example, the Taliban strips women of their humanity.</TE>
<TE>   For a man preoccupied with morality, Josephson still possesses a
nonjudgmental streak, largely out of respect for the notion that
reasonable people of high character often disagree, sometimes vehemently.
He long ago saw relativism for what it is and rejected it, but in a
pluralistic society, exactly what values should we promote?</TE>
<TE>   This may be an easy question for sectarian clergy, but in the temporal
world it's more difficult. Certainly Josephson isn't the only one to
wrestle with it. In the mid-1990s, the Institute for Global Ethics,
founded in 1990 and headquartered in Camden, Maine, with offices in
London and Toronto, did Gallup polling and focus-group research to
explore a related question: Is there a set of shared core values that can
be taught to any individual or group because they are globally understood
to be the moral values of humanity? The answer is unambiguous, says
Rushworth Kidder, the institute's founder and president and a former
columnist and senior editor at the Christian Science Monitor.</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk to people anywhere in the world about what they think
are the most important values to hand on to the next generation, they
will talk to you about five things: compassion, fairness, responsibility,
honesty and respect. It's uncanny the commonality with which those
particular five values keep coming up."</TE>
<TE>   Josephson pursued the same question but used a different technique,
studying every major philosophical, religious, psychological and moral
system he could find--from Confucianism to the Boy Scout oath--to compare
lists of sins and virtues. "I literally put them on a template and asked,
'What are the similarities here?' " he remembers.</TE>
<TE>   His research resulted in what he calls the Six Pillars of Character,
five of which--caring, fairness, responsibility, trustworthiness and
respect--are essentially identical to the values identified by Kidder's
organization. The sixth is citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Josephson's objective was not only to determine universal values but
to define them in language clearly acceptable to conservatives and
liberals, secularists and religious people. "Then we had political
immunity, the bulletproof curriculum," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever someone challenges his authority to lecture others about
ethics, he replies that he's just someone who thinks and worries about
ethics a lot and has some insights to share with those who are willing to
listen. And then he asks, "Which of these six pillars do you have
problems with?" Trustworthiness? Fairness? Respect?</TE>
<TE>   The secular ethics movement appears almost darwinian when one
contemplates how much greater the potential consequences of immorality
have become. While at the Monitor in the 1980s, Kidder interviewed
eminent people in various fields--Jimmy Carter, author Norman Cousins and
historian Barbara Tuchman, among others--for a series on the most
important problems the world would have to address in the 21st century.
Six issues emerged above all others, five of which Kidder considered
fairly obvious: the threat of nuclear catastrophe, environmental
degradation, overpopulation, education reform and the global economic
disparities between the haves and have-nots.</TE>
<TE>   "The sixth one I found fascinating, and I kept hearing it again and
again," Kidder says. "And that was, as Barbara Tuchman first put it to
me, the breakdown in private and public morality. Here was a group of
people from all around the world who, looking into the 21st century, were
saying, 'Look, if we don't get a handle on this question of ethics, it
has the capacity to doom us.' "</TE>
<TE>   Human ingenuity has indeed raised the stakes exponentially, and will
continue to do so. Sophisticated weaponry, nuclear waste, human cloning,
genetic manipulation--every blessing of science and technology also
carries a curse. Even the Internet, for all its magnificence, increases
beyond calculation the risk to personal security, property and even life
itself, facilitating the ability of immoral people to connect and
conspire or gain technical know-how for their malevolent designs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm coming to the conclusion more and more that ethics is absolutely
essential to our survival," Kidder says. "We probably won't survive the
21st century with the ethics of the 20th century. Something profound has
got to change, and unless we begin thinking very hard and very
systematically about this, we run the risk of having the technology get
so far ahead of the ethics that there really is no restraint on it."</TE>
<TE>   Many Americans wistfully remember better times. Schools' biggest
problems were running in the halls and fistfights at the flagpole. You
could walk the streets at night without a care. Song lyrics didn't
celebrate cop killing or misogyny. Ten-year-old boys weren't openly
profane and dismissive of adults. The most controversial thing on
television was Elvis' pelvis. Television news programs valued news over
entertainment, and the president of the United States had enough sense to
keep his pants on in the Oval Office, or so we assumed.</TE>
<TE>   But any longing for those quieter, more innocent times requires a
certain revisionism or, better yet, amnesia. For all its merits, the
"Ozzie and Harriet" era also gave us college basketball scandals,
television quiz show scandals, disk jockey payola scandals, McCarthyism,
unchecked racism and institutionalized sexism. Is America really a less
ethical place now than it was then?</TE>
<TE>   In recent national opinion polls, the majority has said yes: the moral
climate is worse than it was in the 1950s; the positive influences of
religion and the family are declining; education should have a positive
effect on morals but is failing to fulfill that responsibility. A 1998
Christian Science Monitor poll found that nearly 80% of Republicans and
53% of Democrats said the country's morals had fallen significantly in
the previous 40 years. Three of four Americans old enough to have
experienced the 1950s expressed that view.</TE>
<TE>   Josephson's verdict is more mixed. "There are certain areas in which
we're better than we ever were. Our sensitivity to civil rights, women's
rights, children's rights, being sure that we are more diverse as a
culture, dealing with sexual harassment--" Then again, he adds, "I do
believe there has been a moral drift that is very troublesome. All across
the board. As a country we have so degraded the idea that there really
are values, core values, a way a human being ought to be, that we have
packaged [our behavior] in all kinds of rationalism and excuses . . .
We've had all the books of self-indulgence and all the books of looking
out for No. 1 and the like. I believe we are probably individually more
comfortably selfish than we used to be."</TE>
<TE>   Josephson allows himself to go only so far down that path before he
dismisses the usefulness of such assessments. "We keep wanting to measure
whether it's worse or better, and then we get hung up with every example,
which can tie us into knots," he says. "My analysis is simpler: We're not
good enough."</TE>
<TE>   The notion that Americans, and by extension America, are not good
enough can get lost in a haze of self-congratulatory moral isolation, as
David Sedaris points out in his book "Me Talk Pretty One Day." "Every day
we're told that we live in the greatest country on earth," he writes.
"And it's always stated as an undeniable fact: Leos are born between July
23 and August 22, fitted queen-size sheets measure 60-by-80 inches, and
America is the greatest country on earth. Having grown up with this in
our ears, it's startling to realize that other countries have
nationalistic slogans of their own, none of which are, 'We're number
two!' "</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing to intellectualize about good and bad or right and
wrong, but how do you communicate about ethics on a practical level? How
do you apply it to the real world in a way that actually makes a
difference in how people behave? How do you talk about virtue and
character and responsibility in ways that don't alienate people?</TE>
<TE>   These constitute particularly vexing questions in a society that,
beginning with the cultural revolt of the 1960s and 1970s, has moved
significantly away from received morality toward a more relaxed
ethos--the age of designer ethics. More than ever, we insist on
determining for ourselves what it means to be virtuous rather than
allowing doctrinaire codes from higher authorities to be imposed on us.</TE>
<TE>   Thoughtful observers of American values, including David Brooks in his
2000 book "Bobos in Paradise" and Alan Wolfe in "Moral Freedom,"
published last year, describe a culture in which even those who consider
themselves religious choose what they like from the moral doctrines of
their religion, or from several religions, and discard the rest. "There
is a moral majority in America," Wolfe writes. "It just happens to be one
that wants to make up its own mind."</TE>
<TE>   From his earliest days as an ethicist, Josephson has recognized the
need to be strategic, "to package this in a way that doesn't turn people
off." Don't be self-righteous, he counsels others who want to teach
ethics. "I suppose I'm exceptionally sensitive to this because I'm real
easily turned off by self-righteous, finger-wagging moralists."</TE>
<TE>   His direct methodological opposite is Laura Schlessinger, who, as
radio's Dr. Laura dispenses swift, decisive moral advice to her callers
based on Orthodox Judaism, her adopted faith. The combination of
religious judgment on secular airwaves earns her a large, diverse
audience, but also fierce detractors.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a point of view," says the 54-year-old talk-show host. "So
does the pope, so does the president. If the fact that somebody has a
point of view and they represent it and defend it is now worthy of
attack--that's the problem that we've had in the culture wars. Somebody
who has a conviction gets attacked simply for the conviction."</TE>
<TE>   Individuals are free to do whatever they please, she adds, but, "God
made the Commandments, and there's really no room for disagreement with
them."</TE>
<TE>   Josephson finds Schlessinger's tone "harsh." Kidder recoils at her
rigidity. "I have never felt that it was as helpful to the public
discourse to tell people what they ought to think as to tell them how to
think," Kidder says, rejecting the notion that "the way you ought to go
about ethics is to stake out sort of a take-no-prisoners position on one
side of the moral spectrum and say, 'This is what I believe, and anybody
else who doesn't believe this is a dunce.' You're teaching people that
the way to go about public discourse about ethics is at a high volume,
with a certain amount of belligerence and an unwillingness to listen to
the moral nuances. I don't think that's the way we're going to advance
our culture."</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether the growth in secular ethics, with its
less dogmatic persuasions, can advance our culture either. Ethics,
unfortunately, is not a natural product of human maturation. Whatever
attributes one may choose to assign to goodness, they must be learned,
developmental psychologists tell us, which means they must be modeled and
taught. The family and the church have traditionally functioned as
provinces of moral instruction, but these days many families rarely sit
down to dinner together, let alone discuss values. The church undoubtedly
remains society's dominant moral institution, but a majority of polled
Americans have said that religion is losing its influence.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly there is room--some would say a dire need--for the growing
secular ethics movement to play a role in determining how America
behaves, but reliable studies on whether it is doing so are scarce.
Character education in schools logically represents the best hope to
improve future generations, but even that movement's umbrella
organization, the 8-year-old, Washington, D.C.-based Character Education
Partnership, admits to "a dearth of substantive research supporting its
effectiveness."</TE>
<TE>   A notable exception may be an ongoing South Dakota State University
study of Josephson's character education program in middle and high
schools in four South Dakota counties. The study, currently in its fifth
year, relies on student self-reporting; nevertheless, findings from the
past two years show reductions of between 32% and 56% in the commission
of several types of misdeeds, including theft, vandalism, using fake IDs,
taking illegal drugs and engaging in racial or ethnic harassment.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how well conceived or intelligently delivered a program of
ethical guidance may be, however, its success depends entirely on how
receptive people are to its message. In early 2000, the board of the Los
Angeles Unified School District asked the Josephson Institute to assess
its organizational ethics. After considerable research, Josephson and his
staff rendered a highly unflattering written report alleging, among other
transgressions, "concealment and distortion of information, persistent
unaccountability and finger pointing, backbiting, leaking to the press,
violation of confidentiality rules and agreements, personal attacks,
discourtesy, [and] mischaracterizations of motives and positions."</TE>
<TE>   The day after the report came out, Josephson was scheduled to go
before the school board to discuss these rather disturbing findings. Less
than two hours before he was to appear, LAUSD'S executive officer,
Jefferson Crain, called Josephson's chief of staff with a last-minute
change in the agenda. Josephson's presence, it seemed, would not be
needed after all.</TE>

<HD>Organize or Die</HD>
<DH>As Chief of the Powerful United Brotherhood of Carpenters and
Joiners, Douglas McCarron Has Made Plenty of Friends and Enemies. Is He
the Fresh New Face of Labor, or a Throwback to the Days of Bosses and
Patronage?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Douglas J. McCarron enters the room, takes it over, really, with
his lanky 6-foot-5-inch frame, his striking white hair and beard, his
penetrating intensity. He is a man who inspires superlatives, and his
commanding physical presence helps explain why.</LD>
<LD>   Chief of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America,
he is among the most aggressive and controversial of modern labor
leaders: a genius to some, a manipulative tyrant to others.</LD>
<LD>   He offers his hand, the beefy hand of a working-class man though
without the calluses, then settles into a chair that seems far too small
for him. He rarely grants interviews but approaches this one with
apparent ease, folding his hands on the table in his Los Angeles office
and leaning slightly forward, eager, he says, to set the record straight.</LD>
<TE>   Portions of his 550,000-member union are in open revolt. A
lawsuit--since dropped--alleges that he misused a $2-billion pension
fund. And a respected pro-labor foundation is lobbying federal lawmakers
to curb his power.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he is drawing scorn for shrugging off decades of
history and pulling the carpenters out of the AFL-CIO, the national labor
federation. In his bluntly worded withdrawal letter, delivered a year
ago, he portrayed federation leaders as tired bureaucrats stuck in "an
era that passed years ago" and said he could do better on his own.</TE>
<TE>   The letter enraged those loyal to John J. Sweeney, the federation
president who was elected six years ago on a reformist platform.</TE>
<TE>   Some suspect McCarron's real motive was to get free of federation
rules that blocked him from going after the work of other unions, such as
roofing and painting. They say he wants to establish an empire in the
building trades, now a fractious collection of 15 unions.</TE>
<TE>   His enemies--and he has acquired many during his 30-year climb to
power--describe him as arrogant and controlling. They say his $260,000
salary has distanced him from the rank-and-file, that he has grown too
cozy with wealthy contractors and money managers. They question the
union's generous campaign contributions to mayors, governors and
senators, and wonder about McCarron's blossoming relationship with
President George W. Bush, who gave the carpenters' chief a lift on Air
Force One last Labor Day.</TE>
<TE>   But his bold ideas and exuberance also have earned McCarron admirers,
including several of the most active and progressive union presidents in
the federation.</TE>
<TE>   "Doug is committed to organizing and he's putting his money where his
mouth is, and his aggressiveness is right on," says Terence O'Sullivan of
the hefty Laborers International Union of North America. "If we're not
doing aggressive things, we're not going to survive."</TE>
<TE>   The man who churned up these passions is no easy read. At 51, he
recalls with nostalgia the old days of union solidarity. In the next
breath, he dismisses critics within the carpenters as fearful, selfish
bureaucrats or deranged loners or communists. "God bless them," he says
at one point. "They are very hateful people."</TE>
<TE>   He boasts of having blue-collar roots, says he loves to work with his
hands and speaks of a craftsman's pride in a job well done. Then he
launches into the sort of corporate-speak that makes even some supporters
cringe.</TE>
<TE>   In justifying the union's new $22-million training facility in Las
Vegas, McCarron compares his approach to that of retired General Electric
Chairman Jack Welch, guru to the modern CEO. He refers to skilled union
members as "a strong product."</TE>
<TE>   He is easy to misjudge, says Richard Bensinger, a former AFL-CIO
organizing director who now consults for the carpenters. "McCarron
presents a very complicated figure for people," he says. "In some ways I
think he is heartbreakingly good, because I don't think the world is
ready for him."</TE>
<TE>   The question, then, remains unanswered: Is McCarron the fresh new face
of labor or a throwback to the days of bosses and patronage?</TE>
<TE>   The son of a supermarket meat cutter, McCarron dropped out of
Chatsworth High School 33 years ago to hang drywall in housing tracts
sprouting across the San Fernando Valley. Construction work was mainly
union then, and there was plenty of it. McCarron, who was already married
with an infant daughter, says he preferred the physical labor to his
father's dream of a college education.</TE>
<TE>   Before long his knack for maneuvering the rough world of hiring-hall
politics became apparent. He was not yet 30 when elected to his
drywallers' local and named to the Southern California Council of
Carpenters, the negotiating team for contracts covering union carpenters
in 11 counties. Those roles put him across the bargaining table from some
of the region's top construction magnates, including a newcomer named Ron
Tutor, who would later play a major role in McCarron's career. They also
exposed him to senior national officers in the carpenters' union, who
recognized a potentially strong ally in the outspoken delegate from Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   As McCarron's star was rising, however, organized labor was sliding
into its worst slump in history. The mood in business and politics in the
early 1980s was bottom-line and decidedly anti-union. Viewed by many as
bloated, insular and wasteful, unions were losing members and relevancy.
Nowhere was that more painfully true than in the Southern California
housing market, where builders squeezed by high interest rates were
turning union jobs over to recent immigrants willing to work for a
fraction of the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions culminated in 1983 with a divisive three-month strike, mainly
over the use of nonunion labor. It ended when contract language was added
to protect union jobs from subcontracting. But residential construction
kept going nonunion anyway.</TE>
<TE>   As he watched the jobs disappear, McCarron says, he understood the
need for radical change in the way the carpenters did business.</TE>
<TE>   What followed over the next decade and a half is chronicled in more
than 20 crates of legal files stored in the federal archives office in
Laguna Niguel--a trail of lawsuits and countersuits that have McCarron's
name as their common denominator. They detail his ascension to the top
carpenters job in Los Angeles, his expansion of authority in the region
and finally his rise to the national presidency. They flesh out dozens of
rivals who tried to stop him and failed, and were left bitter and
powerless.</TE>
<TE>   The trail begins in 1986, when McCarron, a relatively new trustee of
the carpenters' Southern California Pension Fund, helped instigate a
civil suit in federal court against longtime fund trustees, alleging that
they had made sweetheart loans to developers. The suit was filed by the
newly composed pension board, which included Tutor. Several defendants
today recall that Tutor and McCarron were the leading forces behind the
legal action.</TE>
<TE>   They were aligned against the old guard of Los Angeles construction,
including the region's top carpenters' union officials and several
prominent union contractors, who shared responsibility for making pension
investments. Court documents show that several deals had gone sour,
saddling the fund with foreclosed hotels and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The longtime board members denied doing anything wrong. They said they
openly made low-interest loans for large commercial projects to generate
union jobs at a time when there were few to be had. They argued that they
should not be blamed if some investments failed.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was settled in 1989 when insurance companies agreed to pay
the pension fund nearly $30 million. There was no admission of guilt; no
criminal charges were filed. To satisfy insurance demands, however, all
defendants agreed to permanently resign from the board.</TE>
<TE>   "We became more or less lepers," says Sam Heil, a former pension
trustee who was once Ventura County's top carpenters' official and was
named in the suit. He retired soon after the settlement. Speaking
recently from his home in Ventura, Heil chalks the experience up to a
power play between generations of union leaders. "It's very political,"
Heil says of the carpenters' union. "McCarron was just a little better at
it than most."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Miller, who was the principal carpenters official in Los Angeles
and the defiant leader of the 1983 strike, left the union under a cloud.
McCarron was elected to replace him in the spring of 1987, a year after
the suit was filed. He took office determined to make his mark quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The organization that McCarron inherited was an unwieldy old boys'
club that hadn't changed much in 100 years. Although nominally organized
under a regional council run by an elected secretary-treasurer, the union
was divided into tiny, autonomous fiefdoms, or locals--32 in Los Angeles
County alone. Each local employed a set of full-time elected officers
who, in their small worlds, were privileged and powerful men.</TE>
<TE>   Regional contractors hated the structure and wanted it streamlined.
They wanted to deal with just one jurisdiction, one set of rules, one
pool of workers. "It was ludicrous," recalls Tutor, now one of the
largest public works contractors in California. "All general contractors
complained about that for years."</TE>
<TE>   The builders found a kindred spirit in McCarron, who started
consolidating the union's scattered parts as soon as he took office as
secretary-treasurer. In early 1988, invoking his new powers, he merged 18
locals into four, appointed leaders of the new bodies and transferred
most of their assets to the regional council, which he controlled.</TE>
<TE>   In a sworn declaration to a federal judge several months later,
McCarron said that the mergers were intended to make the union more
efficient, more attractive to contractors. Bringing jobs to members, he
said, was his only consideration. "I have received no personal benefit,
pecuniary or otherwise, from these changes," he asserted.</TE>
<TE>   Five locals refused to go along with McCarron's decree. They sued in
federal court, claiming the new structure stripped members of their
democratic rights. The case did not go well, however, and the
disempowered local chiefs began to make their peace with McCarron. The
last holdout was Stanley Oakley, then secretary-treasurer of Local 769 in
Pasadena and an aspiring political rival of McCarron's for union
leadership. Oakley resisted the takeover for three years. Then he lost an
important court appeal and knew it was over.</TE>
<TE>   "We waited 30 days after the appeal," Oakley recalls. "They didn't
talk to us, so we just stood there and waited. It finally happened one
day at 1 or 2 in the afternoon. There were six of them who came in. I was
there by myself. They kept me in a corner. They wanted my books and my
money. There was a guy screaming in my face, 'Where's the money?' "</TE>
<TE>   Stripped of his office and power, Oakley returned to the old hall
every day for several months. He stood on the sidewalk with shellshocked
members and seethed. He could not let it go. He still cannot let it go.</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, Oakley carries his bitter memories around in a frayed
silver gym bag: Pocket calendars that detail a pre-McCarron life of perks
such as afternoon golf outings and conventions at Lake Tahoe. Yellowed
letters of protest to a succession of national carpenters officials, most
of whom sided with McCarron. An old union constitution. A copy of the
lawsuit. The failed appeal.</TE>
<TE>   One day Oakley, now 72 and living in Pasadena, delivers the bag to a
journalist, saying he wants nothing more to do with it. The old battle is
a burden, he says with a raspy voice. It has ruined his marriage and his
health. Sometimes, he says, he wants to pile up all the papers inside
that bag and burn them. A month later, Oakley has a change of heart. He
calls with an urgent request to retrieve the bag. He is sure there is
damning evidence against McCarron in there, somewhere. He holds on to it
still, despite a creeping certainty that no one will care.</TE>
<TE>   Through the early 1990s, McCarron kept on consolidating and expanding
territory. Where he expected resistance, his agents arrived without
notice, backed by uniformed police officers or sheriff's deputies.
According to old news reports and the recollections of ousted leaders,
the agents grabbed books and money and changed the locks behind them.</TE>
<TE>   Some screamed foul. Others filed lawsuits. But McCarron moved forward
steadily, determined. Dissident members began to call him Pac-Man.</TE>
<TE>   He concedes that he "made some mistakes" in those early days, but
defends the abrupt seizures as necessary. "We're talking about
carpenters' families being exploited," he says. "It's terrible out there.
I don't believe we moved fast enough."</TE>
<TE>   As raucous as it was, the turmoil in Southern California was
overshadowed by a nastier power struggle at the top levels of the
carpenters' union, one that ultimately propelled McCarron to national
office.</TE>
<TE>   Two camps were vying for the general presidency. McCarron cast his lot
with General President Sigurd Lucassen, who won a rumor-shrouded election
at Atlantic City in 1991. Lucassen in turn named McCarron as his second
vice president.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Labor later charged that the election was rigged and
reached a settlement that called for a new election. Lucassen did not
run. His No. 2, Paschal McGuinness, had recently settled charges of labor
racketeering in New York, so he was out. McCarron, the organization's
third in line, was swept to office in 1995, unopposed.</TE>
<TE>   To signal a new era, McCarron ordered the demolition of the union's
historic marble-halled headquarters in Washington, D.C., in the northwest
corner of the U.S. Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   The building was a symbol of everything he hated about the union--its
stodgy bureaucracy, its blind allegiance to the past. "There were rotary
phones in the phone booths," he says, shaking his head in disbelief.
"They never wanted to change anything. They had a printing press that
looked like something Benjamin Franklin would be working on. They were
just stuck."</TE>
<TE>   In its place, a 10-story office building was built. The union rents
out 9 1/2 floors, generating an estimated $18 million in annual revenue.
The remaining half floor holds what is left of the union's once-grand
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   For the future of the carpenters, McCarron says, look West, to a
lonely stretch of desert 10 minutes from the Las Vegas airport. There a
$22-million complex of concrete and glass gives form to McCarron's recipe
for rebuilding the carpenters' strength.</TE>
<TE>   Completed in January 2001, the UBC's International Training Center is
178,000 square feet of dormitories, classrooms and hangar-sized
warehouses where trainees can learn to build stronger scaffolds or to
outsmart anti-union consultants.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 120 member-trainees stay there at any given time, in
surroundings that are both comfortable and spare, just as McCarron
envisioned. Private dorm rooms with cinder-block walls are furnished with
extra-long queen beds and computer hookups, but no televisions. The
cafeteria offers plenty of complimentary food, but no alcohol. A pool and
sauna sit conveniently close to the self-serve laundry room.</TE>
<TE>   The center embodies the pragmatic mind-set of a carpenter, says
McCarron spokesman Monte Byers as he shows a reporter around. Solid, no
frills, hands-on. "Carpenters tend to be concrete, operational guys," he
says. "They don't want theories, they want practical skills."</TE>
<TE>   Here trainees can try out a $90,000 computerized cabinet-milling
machine or operate a heavy crane or build a roof over and over again
until it's perfect. Dozens of skills, from laying carpet to driving a
forklift, are taught in sessions ranging from two days to two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Las Vegas center also churns out instructional books, videos and
CDs, which are shipped to training centers at cost. "We've got over $1
million in training manuals here," says Dudley Light, the center's
training director, patting a row of glossy white videos on hardware
installation.</TE>
<TE>   All told, the union spends $110 million a year on training, funded
through member paycheck deductions, says Light, a carpenter for 31 years
and an enthusiastic McCarron fan. With a growing national shortage of
skilled carpenters, the training in Las Vegas and at 180 smaller union
centers in the U.S. and Canada will give members an edge in a tight job
market, Light says. And the investment shows employers the union is
serious about providing value for higher wages. The center plays another
essential role in McCarron's comeback plan: It is boot camp for his young
army of union organizers.</TE>
<TE>   Rebuilding union strength through aggressive organizing is not a
revolutionary idea; most active unions, fighting a decades-long decline
in membership, have been moving resources in that direction for years.</TE>
<TE>   But McCarron has taken the concept to an extreme. His slogan: Organize
or Die. He devotes half of the union's budget to organizing, far more
than most. (The AFL-CIO's Sweeney is urging unions to spend one-third on
organizing, but only a handful have done so.)</TE>
<TE>   McCarron's dream is to build a corps of street-savvy labor evangelists
who can sell the union to ambivalent workers and hostile employers. He
already has hired 700 full-time organizers, most pulled from the ranks of
working carpenters. All of them learn the basics in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Boot camp offers two weeks of immersion in the high-stakes, cutthroat
world of union organizing. Trainees are given a hypothetical union
campaign and come up with strategies for winning it. Then they are hit
with daily plot twists. As they respond, the trainees are critiqued and
coached by visiting professionals on federal labor laws, common employer
tactics and the whims of the press.</TE>
<TE>   Trainees, who work in teams, huddle into the night to map strategies
for the next day, Byers says. The lessons stick with them, he says,
preparing them for the real pressures they will soon face.</TE>
<TE>   Organizing is tough work, particularly in the building trades, where
job sites, bosses and crews are fluid and subcontracting is routine. It's
hard to keep track of workers, let alone persuade them to stand up to
employers who may never hire them again.</TE>
<TE>   But McCarron, who occasionally makes house calls with organizers,
genuinely seems to enjoy the challenge of taking a prospective member
"from fear to trust." He speaks of it with the zeal of a missionary.</TE>
<TE>   Only by controlling at least 70% of the work in a given industry or
region can the union significantly influence pay, benefits and working
conditions, he says. That was the case a generation ago, when nearly all
of the construction work force was organized and wages topped $30 per
hour. Now the union represents one-third or less of eligible workers,
McCarron says, and is close to zero in some regions such as the South.
Wages have stagnated in the industry and many employers have cut pensions
and health benefits. "Think about it at 10%, how bad it would be," he
says. "There's got to be strong unions. Otherwise, everybody's gonna
hurt."</TE>
<TE>   To make it stronger, he says, he had to streamline the union,
consolidating nationally as he did in Los Angeles a decade earlier. Now,
he says, he can go toe to toe with regional contractors. But critics say
the new structure gives too much power to one man. "No other union has
quite the autocratic setup," says Carl Biers, executive director of the
Assn. for Union Democracy, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based foundation that
promotes the rights of union members. "The system allows for abuse. In a
way, it's the perfect dictatorship."</TE>
<TE>   Since assuming the presidency, McCarron has squeezed the assets and
decision-making of 2,200 autonomous locals into 55 regional councils and
appointed most of their leaders. Some of the largest councils are run by
longtime associates of McCarron. The Southwest Region, which covers
Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, is directed by his younger
brother, Michael.</TE>
<TE>   Adversaries say that the regime moves quickly to silence dissenters
and offer two recent examples:</TE>
<TE>   Eight months after it openly defied McCarron in the summer of 2000, a
union local in Atlanta was placed under trusteeship, its elected
officials made powerless overnight. McCarron said there had been
complaints that the officials--who had been in office less than a
year--were spending union funds without approval. Yet the most damning
evidence he offered was testimony that some legitimate expenditures were
not announced and voted on at membership meetings. The ousted board
members have hired an attorney and asked for a Department of Labor
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   A year earlier in San Francisco, veteran activist John Reimann was
permanently expelled from the union after leading a four-day wildcat
strike to protest a new master contract covering carpenters in the Bay
Area. The contract, which was never put to a vote by members, covered
work on a major airport expansion that involved McCarron's old friend Ron
Tutor.</TE>
<TE>   Reimann's protest, which caused union contractors to lose money for
four days, was intolerable, says Byers, McCarron's spokesman. "You just
don't do that on a project labor agreement," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Biers says the examples fit a long-standing pattern, and that his
organization has been lobbying members of Congress to address it for
several years. Their efforts led to a 1998 hearing on union democracy
before the House Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron testified. He was polished and diplomatic. Speaking
patiently, he assured committee members that all the changes he had made
were legal and for the good of the union. "I take my members' democratic
rights--and their participation in the governance of our
union--seriously," he said. "Our councils are a representative democracy,
not unlike the system that brings each of you to the House of
Representatives."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, committee members drafted legislation guaranteeing union
members' rights to vote directly for their leaders and restricting the
use of trusteeships. The proposal was not vigorously pursued, however,
and never made it out of committee. Similar bills have been introduced
every year since, says Biers. They have stalled in committee each time.</TE>
<TE>   some say that whatever his motives, McCarron's single-mindedness
eventually will backfire by driving members away. They mention what
happened last spring in British Columbia, where angry carpenters voted
for autonomy from the international group in order to escape McCarron's
control. "He takes virtually all the democratic rights away from the
members," says Dave Flynn, secretary-treasurer of the British Columbia
Provincial Council of Carpenters, which is now negotiating its
independence. "We view the union as an organization that's run by the
membership. His view is it's run like a business, very top down."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn says that carpenters in British Columbia are free spirits who
don't like being told what to do. That was made clear early on, when
McCarron came to a meeting hall to explain the structure he planned to
impose. Members demanded the right to vote on any changes and to elect
their new officers. When McCarron refused, they walked out en masse,
turning out the lights and leaving McCarron standing at the podium.</TE>
<TE>   Today he shrugs off the slight, dismissing the British Columbia rebels
as misguided and incompetent idealists. "They only have seven to 10% of
the market," he says of the locals. "They're about out of business. And
there's a high influence of the Communist Party."</TE>
<TE>   Similar rebellions have popped up around North America, giving birth
to political rivals and a few virulent anti-McCarron Web sites. Still,
the opposition lacks the sense of a cohesive movement. At the last
international carpenters' convention, held in Chicago in August 2000,
protesters were lonely voices outside the hall on a day when 91% of
delegates voted in favor of McCarron for a second term.</TE>
<TE>   Dissidents note that a majority of delegates are union staff members
whose jobs ultimately depend on McCarron. But there are, without a doubt,
some genuine McCarron fans among the members, including at least one who
lost status and power under his regime.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Catalano, the former top elected carpenters officer in Ventura
County, was moved to a staff job a year ago when Ventura was merged with
the Southern California region. He lost his freedom, his autonomy, his
identity. But Catalano says the restructuring makes sense for the members
and will help the union grow. "You have to put the welfare of the whole
brotherhood ahead of your own personal concerns," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Catalano acknowledges that members have lost voting rights under
McCarron and that the president has assumed unprecedented powers. Under
some circumstances, that could be a scary thing, he says. But Catalano,
who watched the union share of Ventura construction workers plummet 30%
over two decades, says he is ready for desperate measures.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I look at it, it makes you hope he's right," he says. "From
what I have seen, we're back on the right track of gaining members."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron's future and legacy will likely rest on whether he can indeed
build market share as promised. Supporters point to a few small
successes, such as the rebirth of a union local in Boise, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   "The local had been closed down. There were no signatory contractors
left," McCarron says. "We went up there and reissued a charter, put in a
training program and said come down here and look at the training we can
give. We signed two drywall contractors right away. Now we've got six.
And we're up to 220 members in Boise."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron says that the carpenters'  union has gained 70,000 members
since he took office--a figure some dissidents dispute. Even at that,
union membership would not have kept pace with the booming growth of the
construction trades in the late '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Gasperow, executive director of the Construction Labor Research
Council in Washington, D.C., says about 25% of building trade workers are
union. The mechanical-electrical trades, which include electricians, pipe
fitters and sheet metal workers, tend to have higher-than-average
unionization rates, Gasperow says. The civil trades, including laborers,
operating engineers, painters and carpenters, are below average.</TE>
<TE>   For all of McCarron's bluster, the carpenters are no better or worse
than most, Gasperow says. The union missed its best chance to expand
during the last spurt of construction. Although the jury is still out, he
says, "holding their own in market share is probably the best they can
hope for."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron says that the numbers don't yet reflect his initiatives.
Building an effective campaign takes time and organizers are still green.
He has no doubt that he's leading the carpenters in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting better and better and better at what we're doing,"
McCarron says. "You wait another five years and you're going to really
see an organizing machine. We've got a pretty good one now, but it's
nothing like what we can be. I mean, we can be great."</TE>
<TE>   So far, McCarron has outmaneuvered or outlasted his enemies. One of
his fiercest critics, a retired drywaller named Horacio Grana, died of
liver cancer in January soon after dropping a lawsuit that challenged
McCarron's stewardship of the $2-billion Southern California Carpenters'
pension fund.</TE>
<TE>   The suit claimed that the fund, managed by a board that included
McCarron and Tutor, overpaid investment manager Richard C. Blum, who
earned $54 million in fees over an eight-year period in the mid-1990s. A
spokesman for Blum, who is married to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, maintained
that the payments were reasonable for investments that earned $459
million. Blum handled a small part of the fund.</TE>
<TE>   Grana, a cranky Argentine immigrant who came out of the same union
local as McCarron, alleged a murky web of political and financial
intrigue involving McCarron, Tutor and Blum, but was never able to prove
it. In the end, his complaints often came down to personal vitriol fed by
envy. Like many critics, he couldn't accept that a one-time equal had
risen so far beyond him so fast. "He's a man who doesn't have principles,
no scruples. He doesn't care about the working carpenter," said Grana,
who lived on a $577 monthly pension and complained bitterly about
McCarron's six-figure salary.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit had been the latest longshot hope for McCarron opponents;
Grana's retreat dealt a stomach punch to their campaign to undermine the
union leader's integrity.</TE>
<TE>   It is a tribute to McCarron's power that AFL-CIO leaders are still
trying to woo him back a year after his stinging rebuke. Sweeney, the
president of the national federation of 66 unions, has met regularly with
McCarron, spokesmen for both camps confirm. Neither side will discuss the
nature of the talks.</TE>
<TE>   A Sweeney confidant who asked not to be identified says the federation
continues to hope that the carpenters will return, boosting the AFL-CIO's
clout and finances with $4 million in annual dues. But he notes glumly
that several deadlines for resolution have come and gone.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, other building trades unions are working with McCarron
outside of official federation channels, exacerbating a crack in the
so-called House of Labor at a time when the union movement is struggling
to appear solid.</TE>
<TE>   Construction unions involved in heavy highway work, which had been
organized under an AFL-CIO department, recently established a separate
alliance so that the carpenters could participate. And officials from the
14 construction unions belonging to the AFL-CIO Building Trades
Department offered an olive branch late last year. Although some had been
openly hostile toward McCarron, they voted unanimously to ask him back.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the chief of the carpenters has been publicly mute,
taunting his critics with his silence as his friends wait, confident that
McCarron will emerge with what he wants.</TE>

<LD>In the courtyard of our Koreatown apartment complex, roses run riot
and bougainvillea blooms hang like hearts. At Christmas, the box hedge is
threaded with tiny white lights, and the carriage lamps are garlanded
with swags of balsam. Beneath our bedroom window lies a garden featuring
orchids, a koi pond and several statues of nude men.</LD>
<LD>   For this wondrous landscape, we have our next-door neighbor Emil to
thank. My family and friends back East think L.A. is peopled exclusively
by transients, but Emil, a beacon of stability in this changing world,
has had the same townhouse apartment--a showcase of mirrored walls, red
silk moire, gilt--and the same lover, Bob, for 36 years. In summer, Emil
pads around the courtyard in a jungle print lava-lava, dousing the
agapanthus with a vat of Miracle-Gro. In winter, he emerges in his sable
coat and cries, "Dar-ling! Have you seen my ruby earring?"</LD>
<LD>   Here in L.A., where history is short, Emil, 71, is a window onto a
bygone world. He serves salads of iceberg lettuce and "she-crab," sends
away to places advertised in the back of Town &amp; Country for filet mignon
and pheasant. He eats at the kind of restaurants you see in
black-and-white photos from the '40s--Cassell's, the HMS Bounty, Taylor's
Prime Steak--and shops for upholstery fabric at Michael Levine downtown
in the garment district.</LD>
<TE>   Emil loves to cook, and he has one basic recipe--consisting of olive
oil, dried basil, lemon, and "freshly ground" pepper--that he puts on
everything from London broil to pasta salad. Generous to a fault, he is
always running upstairs to deliver a new culinary delight. "Just call me
Martha," he says, holding out an artfully arranged platter of
breadsticks, canned olives and hearts of palm, all drenched with his
special dressing. He and Bob, a quiet man of 79 whose favorite pastime is
reading, have us down for dinner. We perch on the edge of the
zebra-striped sofa and try to find a place to set our drinks on a coffee
table covered with Waterford bowls and velvet-lined silver boxes. Mozart
plays softly; candles glow.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you think about Proposition 209?" Bob asks conversationally.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you seen my armoire?" Emil interrupts. "It's been appraised at
$20,000."</TE>
<TE>   Bob tries again and queries my husband. "How's the nursing business,
Tim?"</TE>
<TE>   "That Venetian glass candelabra in the hall?" Emil interjects. "It's
worth nine grand." The table is set with Irish lace and Limoges, Baccarat
wine glasses and sterling silver serving tongs. The entree is chicken
with olive oil, dried basil, lemon and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   When Emil and Bob moved to the area in 1960, 8th Street was lined with
jazz clubs, women still wore white gloves and the neighborhood was
entirely Anglo. Back in the '60s, they threw an annual costume party that
required months of preparation--Monte Carlo, Arabian Nights, Disco
Fever--we've seen the slides. Even now, they put on a barbecue each
Fourth of July, featuring mounds of Beluga caviar and minced egg yolk,
lobster-stuffed tomatoes and a cake with boiled frosting meticulously
tinted red, white and blue.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Emil says his fondest wish is to leave the neighborhood, a goal
he intends to accomplish by winning the lottery. Twice a week he makes a
pilgrimage to Vons to purchase $30 worth of tickets.</TE>
<TE>   He leafs through real estate guides in search of Shangri-La. One week
it's an eight-bedroom, three-fireplace condo in Santa Fe, the next, a
shingled mansion on an island off the coast of Maine. He has it all
worked out: He's taking us with him. Tim will be the caretaker of the
estate, Emil and I are going to shop, and Bob, apparently, will go along
for the ride.</TE>
<TE>   Then, every few months, Emil maxes out his credit card, has a moment
of clarity and declares sadly, "Let's face it, Mommy" (he calls me Mommy
Dearest), "I'll probably croak right here in this old dump."</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that he loves it here and would be lost anywhere else. He
knows everyone--every old white or gay person, that is--for blocks
around; he's gone to the same cleaners, post office and veterinarian for
30 years. "Isn't it gorgeous?" he sighs one sunny afternoon, gazing over
his rose-strewn courtyard. "Truthfully, where else could we live like
this for what we pay?"</TE>
<TE>   Emil has one minor quirk. Every six months or so, he picks a huge
fight. One year it was because he felt a yellow ceramic flowerpot I'd put
on the patio clashed with his terra cotta; one year it was because we
kept talking to another neighbor with whom he was feuding. This time,
Emil and Tim finally have a showdown over the stray cats.</TE>
<TE>   Emil has seven cats of his own-- his "kids," he calls them--but he
also leaves food outside his door for strays. This has always been a
minor irritation, but recently it reached critical mass. We have one cat,
Blanche, whose life of leisure and minuscule brain have left her
ill-equipped to deal with the street-smart bullies who flock to Emil's
meals. Not only do they beat her up, they also urinate on our steps and
spray our door. Every morning, I have to go out with a bucket of ammonia
and scrub the whole area down.</TE>
<TE>   Tim begs Emil to stop feeding the strays. The landlord orders him to
stop feeding the strays. Emil swears up and down he isn't feeding the
strays. The only problem is that every morning, Tim checks Emil's front
steps, and every morning he still finds a huge bowl of Friskies and a
saucepan full of milk.</TE>
<TE>   Then one morning (Tim was at work), Emil bangs on our door, brandishes
a blue plastic bowl in my face and screams, "I found this in the garbage!
He picked this up and threw it in the garbage! You tell him if he ever
touches anything of mine again, I'll call the cops . . . ."</TE>
<TE>   "No, you tell him," I say, and quietly shut the door.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, even I think Tim has gone too far--"You can't touch his
stuff, honey!" I tell him that night--but he is unrepentant.</TE>
<TE>   "Emil has the run of this whole place and the one thing I ask, he
won't do," he fumes. Emil is equally intransigent: "After all I've done
for you two," he murmurs, shaking his head when I pass him near the
clothesline.</TE>
<TE>   Guilty by association, my lot is naturally cast with Tim's. Months
pass without a single word exchanged. Then one day, as I traverse what I
think is a vacant courtyard, Emil springs out from behind a hydrangea and
lays a solicitous hand on my arm. "How's Tim?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Fine," I say, edging backward. "Why?"</TE>
<TE>   "Well, it's just that he's been so rude, Bob and I have been worried
about him," he says, his voice dripping concern. "I didn't want to tell
you, Mommie, but he pushed me that day when I asked him about the bowl.
He became violent! With me, a feeble old man . . . ."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, he did not," I snap. "He wouldn't hurt a flea and you know it."</TE>
<TE>   "Of course you would side with him," Emil says. "A wife has to be
loyal no matter how wrong her mate. But just to show I've forgiven him
completely"--here he dashes inside, runs out and hands over a package
decorated with silver sequins, purple feathers and an oversized
glitter-speckled bow--"I bought him a little something today. Tell him
it's from old Emee. Tell him I love him just the same . . . ."</TE>
<TE>   When we moved in eight years ago, Emil took it upon himself to arrange
our living room and lend me the sheer white curtains that still flutter
at the window. Across our plant-filled balcony lies his bedroom, which he
redecorated with tobacco walls, leopard print sheets and a rosewood
screen he swiped, before the relatives arrived, from the apartment of a
friend who died of AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   A few nights later, I play the piano, not very well: "Traumerei" and
"Clair de Lune." Emil and Bob have already finished their cocktails and
dinner, and I know he's over there lying in bed playing with the cats,
mulling over whether he should paint his walls cafe au lait next time,
looking forward to watching his new video of "Auntie Mame."</TE>
<TE>   I falter on Chopin's "Nocturne in E-flat," and Emil's voice drifts
across the darkness. "You're so talented, Mommy Dearest! I don't know
what we'd do if you two ever moved, you're just like family . . . ."</TE>
<TE>   It all passes before me--the shared food, the laughs, the fights.</TE>
<TE>   "You said it, Emee," I call back, butchering another trill. "We're
just exactly like family."</TE>

<HD>Lost Vegas</HD>
<DH>In the Beginning, There Was Fremont Street--the First Incarnation
of  the American Capital of Sin. Today This Boulevard of Faded Signs Is
a Way Station for Hopeful Immigrants and a Last Stop for the Desperate.</DH>

<LD>Before there was the Strip, there was Fremont Street. Decades ago,
as the East Coast mobsters began transforming Las Vegas from a small-time
oasis of vice into America's capital city of sin, visiting gamblers and
vacationers stayed in Fremont Street motels like the Para-Dice and the
Blue Angel. Now, crowded from view by the billion-dollar pleasure domes
just a mile away, eastern Fremont Street is an all-but-forgotten fragment
of history in a town habitually hostile to the past.</LD>
<LD>   There are no tourists at this end of Fremont. Instead, this weathered
string of vintage motels, pawnshops and check-cashing outlets is home to
an assortment of people who are as invisible to the city's millions of
visitors as is the street itself. Though police have stepped up patrols
in the last couple of years, the area is still known as one of the most
dangerous in downtown Vegas--a place crawling with feral losers in a city
built on the idea that anyone can be a winner.</LD>
<TE>   Amid the criminal types living there are a surprising number of
ordinary families, optimistic immigrants and clean-living Christian
evangelists. Some people wind up on Fremont Street at the end of their
road, having nowhere else to go. For others it's not a terminus but a
place of transition: a gateway into America or a place to recover after a
bad marriage, a lost job or bad decisions. People with histories of
terrible hardship and bad behavior live next door to others whose tales
are startlingly normal. Families from India run motels inhabited by
prostitutes and job-hunting young couples, blue-collar workers and
Bosnian refugees. Crackheads and alcoholics loiter on Sunday mornings in
front of an African American church.</TE>
<TE>   City developers have turned a couple of blocks at Fremont's western
end into a theme-park caricature of its former self, a frantically
overlit string of nickel-slot casinos collectively dubbed "The Fremont
Street Experience." But on eastern Fremont, it's dark at night--except
for the modest neon signs of the surviving motels.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: This is the first and last time I stay on Fremont Street,"
says Stanley Alexander, 35, who's been staying at the Vegas Motel for a
couple of months. His room is rife with roaches and spiders, the walls
are smeared with grease, and drunks hassle him every morning on his way
to work at a nearby Big O Tires. "I wouldn't be staying here at all, but
I got stuck," says Alexander. "Once you start in paying $500 a month,
it's hard to save up the money to go somewhere else."</CP>

<CP>PHOTOGRAPHER: His name is Raymond McIntosh, but everyone knows him
as The Bishop. Every day, in his "Jesus Is the Answer" storefront church
on an especially scabrous Fremont block, the former drug dealer goes
toe-to-toe with the devil. Most of his flock are former or current
denizens of the street: prostitutes, dealers, people addicted to alcohol,
drugs or gambling. His pulpit-pounding Sunday morning services leave them
weeping, shouting and fainting in the aisles. The Bishop has helped many
find what he considers a better path. His wife, for instance, is a woman
whom he helped cure of "a 20-year  addiction to lesbianism."</CP>
<CP>PHOTO: Since 1996, the Hialeah Motel has been a business and home
for the Mehtas--one of about a dozen Indian immigrant families operating
motels along Fremont Street. The Mehtas came here straight from a village
of a few thousand people in Gujirat province. "We had seen Las Vegas on
TV, but we had no idea," says patriarch Satish Mehta (left). "I had never
seen so much light in my life."</CP>

from all the craziness there." There are crackheads and shootings at the
Tiv-On Apartments next door, but McLain feels safe at the Vagabond; no
trouble there beyond occasional fistfights. "Everyone here keeps an eye
out for each other," she says.</CP>

says he won $87,000 in a national rodeo competition in the '80s but lost
it all in a divorce from a greedy wife. Now he collects disability and
drinks beer in the mornings on a Fremont Street sidewalk.</CP>

hotel-casinos.  A syndicate tied to Bugsy Siegel bought it back in the
early 1940s, in the first stage of  a campaign to turn Vegas into a world
center of sin and sybaritism. The mobsters soon moved on to the Strip.
These days, the El Cortez is one of the city's cheapest places to stay
and gamble.</CP>

<LD>The mystery safe had been on the sales floor at the St. Vincent De
Paul store ever since she started going there five or six years ago. The
safe was a murky aqua blue and about 3 feet high, and it had a $69 price
tag. I'm sure it was a pretty good safe, but the combination had been
long lost. I don't know much about safes, but I suspect this would
compromise its value.</LD>
<LD>   "There could be a million dollars in there, just sitting there," she
said. "Or an unpublished Dostoevsky manuscript. Or a human head."</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe we should buy it," I suggested. "We could blow it up. Or hire a
safecracker. Knowing you, you've probably got one in your address book."</LD>
<TE>   "I wonder if they'd let us blow it up here. That way we wouldn't have
to move it."</TE>
<TE>   She loved thrift stores, along with rummage sales and EBay. Basically,
she just really loved stuff. All sorts of it. She collected milk glass,
Bauer pottery and old ceramic pot lids for tooth powder. Lately she had
also developed a troubling fixation with scissors. She wasn't so much a
pack rat as a collector whose passions were so numerous and eclectic as
to converge into something that might resemble compulsive hoarding. I was
the opposite, with a tendency to junk any item in the household I hadn't
used or read or played with for more than my arbitrary time frame of 14
months. If we stayed together, this would be a problem: Before me lay a
specter of shelves groaning with dishes, closets stuffed with other
people's photo albums, avalanches of three-legged chairs in the garage
and the paralyzing frustration I feel when confronted with clutter. Could
a purger and a binger find domestic bliss?</TE>
<TE>   Her fondness for thrift stores extended well beyond her thrill over a
good treasure hunt, although that was a good part of it. Thrift stores
were her supply depot. Her job took her all over town, and there were
days when she was working double shifts and all but lived in her car. If
she needed a clean outfit, she popped into a thrift store and plucked one
off the rack.</TE>
<TE>   She grew up in Los Angeles but was the daughter of hardscrabble
Midwestern parents who'd grown up poor. For them, the Great Depression
was a phantom that may have been pushed off center stage but was always
ready for a curtain call. Scavenging was in her blood; her father was  a
raider of dumpsters and refuse heaps who brought home boxes of wine,
unopened chocolates, old television sets and broken typewriters, all of
which were either used, fixed or sold. On our first date, she spotted a
chest of drawers discarded in an alley. She ran to her car, plucked a
screwdriver from the trunk and pulled off the drawer handles. They were
ornate, and she would use them in her art.</TE>
<TE>   She had style in abundance. And yet she was wearing rags and feathers
from Salvation Army counters. "I refuse to wear anything but handmade
leather-soled designer shoes, and I refuse to pay more than $6 for them,"
she liked to say. Women at the parties she catered in Beverly Hills and
Hollywood were always asking what boutiques she shopped in. When she told
them Goodwill, they were never sure whether to take her seriously.
Certainly she had an eye, if not an internal homing mechanism.</TE>
<TE>   Among America's mythic, puritanical virtues, frugality has not so much
been lost as actively and scornfully flung away. People these days are
less apt to talk about economizing than the "psychology of abundance,"
which to me always sounded like a mental tactic to ignore the fact that
you don't have any money. She did not need Suzie Ormand to tell her there
was gold in the loose change that fell between the car seats. Coming out
of a marriage with $5,000 and a 10-year-old car, she rented a room in a
friend's house for $200 a month, reinvented herself as a caterer and
floral designer, and within two years had squirreled away enough for a
substantial down payment on a house. In those two years of hard work, she
probably averaged $12 an hour. I loved this about her, and while I've
always enjoyed shopping about as much as time-share sales pitches, I came
to look forward to our weekend thrift store expeditions. At first it was
vicarious: Her enthusiasm for plunging into a bin of chipped pottery and
emerging with some semi-significant artifact was contagious. After a
while, I started getting into the spirit of it. We bought a lot of
cookware together, which when you're dating is laden with unspoken
expectation. We were testing the idea of settling down together.</TE>
<TE>   Our first thrift store excursion was in Bakersfield, where she'd lived
for several years. I'd come along to hold her hand while she saw the
lawyer handling her divorce, which for a number of complicated reasons
had been stalled for two years. On the way up she drove, as always, like
a bat out of hell, doing her makeup in the rearview, managing the
steering wheel with her knee. She kept telling me I'd get used to it, not
to worry, that she'd never had an accident, St. Christopher was looking
out for her. But it made me nervous. I figured it was a matter of time
before something happened.</TE>
<TE>   After the legal consultation, we had lunch in a Basque restaurant and
went to the Goodwill there, one of her favorites. As a joke for a friend,
I bought a coffee mug emblazoned Houchin Bloodbank Gallon Member, but I
ended up keeping it. I thought it a humorously macabre image to
contemplate before one's breakfast, sort of like getting ashes on your
forehead during Lent. I also found a battery-powered cocktail mixer--a
glass vessel with a plastic rotary stirrer. Stenciled on it were the most
amazing cocktail recipes, such as the one for a gin and tonic. "One ounce
gin; add tonic." It was magnificently heroic in its uselessness and oddly
priced at $1.81, which got me wondering about what sort of strange value
logic was at work here.</TE>
<TE>   As we stood in the checkout line, she told me about a conversation
she'd had in this very store. She'd started chatting with a man who
confessed to her, "I come here to meet the women. It's the best place to
find ladies who don't have too high expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Thrift stores are heavy with ghosts. At some point in your life you
have to make friends with ghosts, and thrift stores are a good place to
do this. I was very sensitive to ghosts at this point. It was winter and
I had had a birthday, one that punched me in the head with the fact I was
irrevocably in my 40s, a trend I'd tried to convince myself was
reversible. One day we were at the St. Vincent de Paul (home of the
mystery safe) and had wandered into the "art section." There were
pictures of sad-eyed dogs, rustic scenes of red barns, landscapes of
sylvan streams illuminated by golden Jesus-light bolting through the
clouds, nouvelle-deco prints from the early '80s framed in plastic. Then
we came across a man's portrait, done in pastel. He looked to be in his
late 50s, and judging by the floppy collar and powder blue hue of his
sport shirt, the portrait was probably done in the '70s. He had the
wistful, boyish and sheepish smile of a man who spent too much time on
the golf course away from his family, then got cancer and regretted
it--but of course, I am projecting, and what I have come to love about
thrift stores is the way they conjure up such flights of imagination.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the story with this?" I asked her. "This guy must have been
somebody's father, or grandfather. Didn't anybody love him enough to keep
his portrait?"</TE>
<TE>   She almost started crying. I was fairly good at accidentally making
her cry, so I moved her along.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the ghosts hung with us. Thrift stores promote a kind of time
travel. Looking at an old hair-dryer chair made me think of the beauty
parlor where my grandmother got her hair done in the early '60s. There
were old phonographs, the ones with the lasers that shine on the grid
around the turntable so you could sync it to the right speed, and I
thought of one I bought in college that my roommate spilled beer on the
day I brought it to the dorm brand new. There was a lot of old cookware
with handles made of bakelite, an early form of plastic that smells of
camphor when you rub it, and old suitcases with name tags filled in by
little old ladies who once lived in Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   Thrift stores are eco-systems, archeological treasure troves, museums
of obsolescence. Thrift stores are time machines and they are social
levelers: There are not many places where you see, as I did at Valley
Thrift in Sunland, a Mexican grandmother rifling through a rack of
clothes and standing next to a blue-haired, art-damaged, tattooed,
nose-ringed bohemian young woman of about 20. The girl spoke pigeon
Spanish and trolled for a size 6 jumpsuit for one of the lady's
grandkids, and the elder woman was zeroing in on funky paisley blouses in
return.</TE>
<TE>   By summer, our relationship had frayed beyond repair. The timing had
been wrong, I guess. Each of us had carried into it too much unchecked
baggage, and when it finally came across the transom, our parting was not
completely amicable--although against our better judgment, we kept
talking. She continued to drive like a maniac, knee on the steering wheel
as she did her makeup or opened cans of dog food for the basenji in the
back seat, her constant companion. Finally it caught up with her. A few
days before her divorce was finalized, her crazed and often
sleep-deprived driving habits landed her in some very hot water.</TE>
<TE>   Basically, she was flipping out. I brought her to my house and put her
to bed.</TE>
<TE>   The divorce was settled; now loomed another court date. The judge gave
her a choice between a hefty fine and a hefty contribution to community
service. Ever frugal, she chose the latter. She would have ended up
picking up trash on the side of the freeway, but she told them she was
expecting.</TE>
<TE>   This was more of a wish than a lie, but it gave her the option to
fulfill her service obligation by working at the Goodwill. One Sunday I
stopped in, not knowing if she would be there. I found her in a back
room, sorting through clothing donations, and spied on her for a few
minutes as she organized garments into piles. Coming across what looked
like a vintage dress, she glanced around to see if anyone was looking,
and with that particular kind of nonchalant efficiency that only women
have, tried it on for size.</TE>

<HD>Proper Asparagus</HD>
<DH>The Etiquette and History Behind the Popular Vegetable</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID DOWNIE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It all started in a San Diego share-rental with a fern dangling
from one of those 1970s macrame potholders. Classes were about to begin
at UCSD, and I had an appointment to see an apartment. As I assessed the
barefoot landlady, her fern kept tickling my neck.</LD>
<LD>   "Wild asparagus," she whispered. "Reminds me of dinners with Mom.
Loved the asparagus, not Mom." She nipped off a branch and munched
distractedly. "Ever read Euell Gibbons?"  I decided against taking the
apartment and wouldn't read Euell Gibbons' 1962 book "Stalking the Wild
Asparagus" until much later in life. And it was nearly 20 years before I
encountered another wild asparagus. But this time, the circumstances were
less sinister. I was hiking through pre-Roman ruins in Sardinia.</LD>
<LD>   A winemaker was showing me his family's Nuragus vineyards, stitched
among rolling orchards north of Cagliari. Probably the oldest native
Sardinian grape variety, Nuragus got its name from the island's 7,000
Bronze Age cyclopean stone mounds called Nuraghi, many of which are edged
by grapevines and wild asparagus.</LD>
<TE>   The owner, Giuseppe Argiolas pinched the scaly head off an asparagus,
indicating I should taste it. Hesitantly I sniffed and took a bite. I've
been a wild asparagus addict ever since.</TE>
<TE>   A wispy weed with grass-green stalks 5 feet long, Liliaceae Asparagus
officinalis is the mother of all commercial varieties and, to my palate,
more intensely flavorful than most varieties. It grows from a cluster of
underground rhizomes that yield pencil-thin, edible spears for more than
30 years. My Sardinian encounter piqued more than curiosity: I began
stalking books about asparagus in public libraries, snapping up the
cultivated version in open markets and the wild ones wherever I found
them growing. In parts of California, for instance, escapees from
cultivation thrive among the coyote shrubs, to the delight of Euell
Gibbons' wild-food followers.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the Italians who've always been fanatical worshipers of the
vegetable. There are numerous annual asparagus festivals around the
country. The ancient Romans grew the vegetable to obscene sizes,
dedicating it to Venus and ascribing it aphrodisiac qualities that have
never been scientifically proved. I once trekked to Bassano del Grappa, a
farm town inland from Venice, where I discovered that each newlywed
couple indeed receives a single spear flanked by two boiled eggs.</TE>
<TE>   The ancient Romans were also probably the first to recognize that
asparagus should barely be cooked. Whenever Augustus Caesar felt rushed,
it's said, he ordered underlings to accomplish tasks in "less time than
it takes to cook an asparagus." Old Italian recipes haven't changed much.
One calls for parboiled or grilled spears to be dipped in olive oil and
mixed with crumbled boiled eggs--a surprisingly exquisite combo. Lemon
and olive oil with a pinch of freshly ground black pepper is a
centuries-old favorite asparagus dip of Mediterranean nations. There
etiquette says that when asparagus is correctly cooked al dente, one
should be able to hold the spears by the base between thumb and
forefinger and savor them like a banana. In Italy, slicing asparagus with
a knife and fork is an insult, indicating the cook has rendered this
gourmet treat flaccid. After all, few things are worse than limp
asparagus, wild or cultivated.</TE>
<TE>Asparagi Con le Uova</TE>
<TE>   (Asparagus with Crumbled Eggs)</TE>
<TE>   Serves 4</TE>
<TE>   4 large eggs</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds green asparagus</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   4 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus 1/4 cup for
garnish</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground black pepper</TE>
<TE>   Put eggs in a small saucepan filled with cold water, bring water to a
boil and simmer for 12 minutes. Pour off boiling water and run cold water
over eggs until easy to handle. Peel, roughly chop and place in a
medium-size mixing bowl. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a large pot or frying pan. Rinse
asparagus and with a vegetable peeler or paring knife, scrape the stems
and snap off the woody ends. Toss asparagus into boiling water, cover,
and when the water returns to a boil, remove lid and cook until barely al
dente, 5-8 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   With a fork stir the oil, grated cheese and a generous pinch of salt
and freshly ground black pepper into the chopped eggs, crushing to form a
coarse paste. With a ladle, add 1-2 teaspoons of the asparagus boiling
water, thinning the paste.</TE>
<TE>   Drain asparagus through a colander, rinse with cold water and transfer
to serving platter. Garnish with the chopped egg mixture and additional
cheese if desired.</TE>

"This year is Valentino's 30th birthday. I am old, and this place is
ancient!" he adds with a rueful groan. In fact, the Sicily-born
restaurateur doesn't look a day over 40, and in a city where it's hard to
name more than a handful of good restaurants over a decade old, Valentino
continues to have quite a run. It's a movie with a happy ending for the
charismatic Selvaggio, who came to California to study and ended up
proprietor of a renowned Italian restaurant that he named for silent film
star Rudolph Valentino.</LD>
<LD>   Today Selvaggio is as famous in Italy as he is in the States, a
familiar figure at every important wine and food event, with Valentino
perhaps best known for its splendid Italian wine list.</LD>
<LD>   Not bad for a place that started out as a beer joint with food. In
1972, Selvaggio and his then-partner Gianni Paoletti saved enough to buy
the restaurant and began working the tables themselves. Like some of the
biggest stars in the Michelin firmament, Valentino evolved from modest
beginnings. Bit by bit through the years, Selvaggio has added rooms,
redecorated and redefined his restaurant. The look is more stolid than
elegant, but I doubt many people notice as they are swept off their feet
by the effusive welcome.</LD>
<TE>   For the past 16 years, Angelo Auriana, a native of Bergamo in northern
Italy, has been executive chef. In the early days, Valentino turned out
the generic Italian fare typical of the '70s in Los Angeles. But
Selvaggio, himself not a chef, decided to go beyond the predictable,
helping revolutionize Italian cuisine here.</TE>
<TE>   Selvaggio was also one of the first Italian restaurateurs in this
country to look beyond the cliche of straw-wrapped Chianti flasks to
explore the entire palette of Italian wines. In the last couple of
decades, as Italian winemakers have made tremendous strides, Selvaggio
has been right there, encouraging, buying and broadcasting the news.</TE>
<TE>   Today his 200,000-bottle cellar is arguably the best in the world for
Italian wines, put together by someone absolutely passionate about wine.
It includes not only Tuscany and Piedmont, the two best regions for
Italian reds, but also cutting-edge wines from all over Italy. Now that
the south of Italy is producing some extraordinary bottles, Valentino is
the champion and showcase for these little-known producers. At the same
time, the list is deep in older vintages from heavy hitters such as
Angelo Gaja, Tignanello and Sassacaia.</TE>
<TE>   Dining at Valentino always is suffused with a sense of occasion, from
the ceremonious greeting at the door to the lingering arrivederci.
Selvaggio's genius is his warmth and charm, in the way he makes each
guest feel they have his entire attention for the time they are there.
That may be why few, with the exception of first-time diners, consult the
printed menu. It seems almost rude not to put yourself in the hands of
Selvaggio and his capable staff. Everything conspires to seduce you into
ordering what Valentino does best, the extravaganza menu, a series of
little courses that can be tailored to the night, the wines and the whims
of either the customer or the chef.</TE>
<TE>   The chef may send out a dainty portion of grilled, sweet cuttlefish on
a yellow pepper puree or a beguiling taste of pesciolini fritti, fried
whitebait with a squeeze of lemon to tempt you. Somehow, before you know
it, everyone at the table has jettisoned any ideas of ordering a la
carte. The sommelier, resplendent in double-breasted jacket with satin
lapels, white pique shirt and burgundy bow tie is at the table suggesting
a new white from Friuli or Alto Adige. Or something made from an antique
grape that would be hard to find in any wine dictionary. Moderation? Not
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   On my last visit, the meal began with a few spoonfuls of earthy
cannellini bean soup garnished with ochre sea urchin and San Marzano
tomatoes framed in a white porcelain bowl. It turns out sea urchin and
beans are made for each other. Then came a small portion of farro salad.
That's the ancient grain from Tuscany, nut brown and chewy, lightly
dressed and topped with snowy white lump of crab meat from Australia. It
was inscribed with a swirl of 25-year-old mahogany aceto balsamico with
enough acidity to balance its sweetness.</TE>
<TE>   Twice a week, seafood arrives directly from the Mediterranean. That's
when you might be plied with a minimalist composition of scorpionfish and
monkfish with musky porcini mushrooms from Italy. The pasta might be an
Abruzzese dish of fedelini (thin noodles) sauced in the fragrant,
garlicky juices of a fish ragu. The fresh seafood is one reason why wine
buffs and bon vivants like to show up for Friday lunch, a leisurely meal
for which Auriana does some of his most inspired cooking.</TE>
<TE>   While initially modeling Valentino after such restaurants as San
Domenico in Imola, Italy, which get raves from the French Michelin,
Selvaggio has belatedly come to appreciate regional cuisine, the cooking
of the heart, as he puts it. Yet he's got a chef who, in truth, seems
more interested in elegantly minimalist contemporary cuisine in the style
of Gualtiero Marchesi (the first three-star Michelin chef in Italy). This
creates a conflict, but also a dialogue, and out of this has come some of
the most engaging cooking I've had at Valentino in a while. Now even the
bland molded vegetable purees that are a hallmark of fancy Italian
cuisine taste bolder. I'm thinking of the artichoke tortino, which can
taste like baby food but here has the full flavor of the artichoke. And a
miniature thin-crusted tart filled with raschera cheese under a blizzard
of fresh white truffle shavings does justice to Alba's famous fungi.</TE>
<TE>   The kitchen is turning out more soulful pastas, too. Selvaggio is
enthusiastic about an artisanal pasta producer he's found in Torre
Annunziata, south of Naples. One of the antique pasta shapes there is
candele, tall tubes of pasta the size of church tapers. Auriana cuts them
in four and serves them with a sauce of San Marzano tomatoes grown in the
volcanic soil of Mt. Vesuvius and some tender burrata cheese made just
that morning. Nothing could be simpler. Nothing could be tastier. The
same goes for Latini spaghetti, from another artisanal pasta maker,
served with spring onions and pungent pecorino Romano.</TE>
<TE>   Now, along with the predictable venison or veal chop, you can get
something as interesting as wild rabbit with snails and rosemary, a
wonderfully earthy dish for red wine. If my recent meals are anything to
go by, Valentino is continuing to evolve. That being said, the normal
main courses (those on the menu) can be dull--for example, a filet mignon
of Piedmontese beef that's both too tender and without much flavor, or
pigeon in a sticky-sweet fig and honey sauce. These verge on generic
restaurant food that you could find anywhere in the world. When it comes
to the finale, you may be happier with the well-edited cheese plates than
most of the uninspired--though technically well-executed--desserts.
Instead, live a little and order a glass of glorious vin santo from
Tuscany or any of the other unique Italian dessert wines on the list.</TE>
<TE>   Valentino may have the best service in all of Southern California.
Under the direction of maitre d' Giuseppe Mollica, it has not only a
clockwork precision but a warmth and thoughtfulness that's notably
missing from many high-end restaurants. It's to Selvaggio's credit that
Valentino has become a beloved institution where a long list of loyal
customers celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and the important occasions
in life. It's even more beautiful that, at 30 years of age, Valentino has
found the cuisine of the heart.</TE>

<HD>Woeful Health Facilities Putting Indians at Risk</HD>
<DH>Medicine: A lack of funds and other systemic failures have created
an emergency situation for Native Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT KELLEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ADA, Okla.
</DL>
<LD>A nurse midwife pulled a limp and blue Tyler Bryant Tipton into the
world at a Native American hospital that wasn't ready for him.</LD>
<LD>   The midwife used a suction cup device to help pull Tyler out of his
mother, tugging so hard that the cup popped off twice and she fell back
against the wall. Once Tyler was delivered, nurses and doctors couldn't
find an infant-sized breathing mask. A worker sent to find one came back
with an adult-sized mask.</LD>
<LD>   Tyler has cerebral palsy, which a medical expert hired by the Tipton
family concluded was caused by a string of mistakes at his 1997 birth. If
the midwife had called a doctor to perform a Caesarean section, Tyler
probably would not have had brain damage, Dr. John R. Marshall concluded.</LD>
<TE>   The government has since paid the family $5.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes you wonder why nothing's been done," said Tyler's mother,
Misty Tipton. "They're just damaging babies. It seems like they would do
something about it."</TE>
<TE>   An Associated Press analysis of court and government records and
interviews with outside experts, agency officials and patients found
problems like the Tiptons' at facilities run by the Indian Health
Service, the federal agency that provides health care for American
Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Although Indians get more services than uninsured Americans, IHS care
has been called substandard by federal judges and is usually less
comprehensive than what privately insured Americans get.</TE>
<TE>   IHS officials acknowledge the shortcomings, but say their agency has
helped Indians make dramatic health gains in recent decades.</TE>
<TE>   "We're way underfunded," said Dr. Craig Vanderwagen, the agency's
chief medical officer. "But we do well with what we have."</TE>
<TE>   What the IHS has is a budget of $2.9 billion this year, although not
all that budget goes for patient care.</TE>
<TE>   While Americans average $3,800 each in health care per year, the IHS
provides about $1,300 per person.</TE>
<TE>   The IHS really needs about $15 billion a year to adequately serve
Indian health needs, said Dr. Michael Trujillo, the agency's head.</TE>
<TE>   AP examined hundreds of government documents, interviewed dozens of
people in 13 states and visited Indian communities in New Mexico,
Oklahoma and South Dakota. Among the findings:</TE>
<TE>   * At least 21 of the more than 900 doctors who have worked for the IHS
in the last six years have been punished by state medical boards, AP
checks of disciplinary records found. The medical boards, which are
independent of the IHS, punished the doctors for administrative, ethical
or competence problems including chronic drug abuse, negligence involving
patient deaths and sexual misconduct with patients. About 2.6% of the IHS
doctors had been sanctioned--more than four times the average for the
federal government and the highest of any federal agency that employs
doctors.</TE>
<TE>   * Since 1997, 16 of the 49 IHS hospitals have been cited as among the
worst in the nation for at least one quality criterion by the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. That means
hospitals did not meet the minimum standards in one or more areas set by
JCAHO, which sets national quality standards for hospitals. For example,
the rating agency cited the Phoenix Indian Hospital in 1999 for not
meeting any of its standards in the care of patients during operations.
Less than 1% of hospitals nationwide ranked that poorly.</TE>
<TE>   Vanderwagen, IHS' chief medical officer, said the problems went well
beyond mere record-keeping. "It was a host of other issues working at
quality," he said. "How do we know we're getting the quality we want if
we're not putting it down?"</TE>
<TE>   * Patients or relatives filed 342 formal malpractice complaints
against the IHS from January 1997 through Sept. 30, 2000, according to
records released under the Freedom of Information Act. That's more than
one complaint for every three doctors. Although most claims were denied,
the agency has paid at least $23.6 million in malpractice settlements and
judgments in the last four years. No federal agency tracks malpractice
claims against private-sector doctors and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   IHS officials say the number of malpractice complaints is low for a
system its size.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have our failures, like anybody does," Vanderwagen said. "And,
interestingly, most of those are system failures as opposed to
individual-practitioner failures. . . . And each one of those failures is
a lesson, and we share those with the providers in the field."</TE>
<TE>   * The diagnosis was wrong for one in five patients listed in IHS
computer files as diabetic or infected with common diseases, according to
a study of 1996 and 1997 data by researcher Kelly Gonzales of the
Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board.</TE>
<TE>   * Due to a lack of money, IHS rations specialty care. That means
patients in some areas are forced to do without some treatments and
tests, such as mammograms or gall bladder surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "You can be suffering with gall bladder attacks, in a lot of pain, but
if it's not life-threatening [the response is], 'I'm sorry, you're going
to have to put up with that pain,' " said Deanna Bauman, health director
for the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   The government has promised to provide health care to American Indians
in treaties and laws dating to colonial times.</TE>
<TE>   IHS was created in 1955 to meet that obligation. It provides health
care to more than 1.5 million Indians, or about 60% of the Americans who
identify themselves solely as Indian.</TE>
<TE>   Even the agency's harshest critics say IHS has many talented and
dedicated caregivers and has helped Indians make dramatic health gains in
recent decades.</TE>
<TE>   Indian infant death rates have dropped by more than half since the
early 1970s, to a rate of 8.9 per 1,000 births. That's still far higher
than the national average of 7.2 infant deaths per 1,000 births, however.</TE>
<TE>   Indian children are vaccinated at higher rates than the general
population, but Indians are still plagued by serious health problems.</TE>
<TE>   A 1998 IHS study found that Indians are 7.4 times more likely to die
from alcoholism, five times more likely to die from tuberculosis, four
times more likely to die from diabetes and nearly twice as likely to die
from suicide or homicide than the general population.</TE>
<TE>   The strain on IHS is only increasing as the Indian population booms.
The number of Indians living in areas served by IHS facilities jumped
27.6% between 1990 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's problems have real-life consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Patients allege that some IHS facilities are so dirty they are
dangerous. Renee Knepp sued the Albuquerque Indian Hospital because her
6-year-old son cut his finger on a scalpel he found in the waiting room
in 1998. Government lawyers acknowledged the boy found the scalpel but
denied IHS wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides moved to dismiss the lawsuit earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Patients with life-threatening conditions have been sent home. In New
Mexico, lawsuits have accused IHS workers of sending home four patients
who later died of heart attacks or infections.</TE>
<TE>   Blaise Magooshboy Jr., a baby boy, died on the Mescalero Apache
reservation in 1998. When his parents brought Blaise to an IHS hospital
emergency room, a nurse told them he had chicken pox and sent them home,
according to the family's lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   When the boy's mother and grandmother brought him back two days later,
the lawsuit said, he waited hours to get treatment, then stopped
breathing as workers were drawing blood for tests. Attempts to revive him
failed. He died of septic shock, his system overwhelmed by the chicken
pox.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers defending IHS said Blaise's mother took him home from the
first hospital visit before a doctor could see the boy. The government
denied malpractice.</TE>
<TE>   The family settled the lawsuit out of court in December. The terms
weren't disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the Tiptons measure Tyler's achievements in smaller steps
than parents of other 4-year-olds. His head often lolls to one side. His
hands are curled and clumsy, his arms and legs loose and shaky.</TE>
<TE>   But he can smile. He can laugh. He can make friends at school.</TE>
<TE>   The Tiptons sued IHS after they heard from other parents at Children's
Hospital of Oklahoma that other children had been injured at birth at
Carl Albert Indian Hospital. The Tiptons said they didn't know about any
problems with IHS before Tyler's birth.</TE>
<TE>   "When we went to the hospital, we figured, they're the professionals,
it was their job," Misty Tipton said. "We put our trust in them."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, JCAHO cited the 53-bed Carl Albert hospital for lapses in
medication use, staff training and assessments, record-keeping and
infection control.</TE>
<TE>   After a follow-up visit in March 2000, JCAHO investigators still gave
Carl Albert the lowest possible rating for assessing staff competence and
screening incoming patients.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital spokeswoman Kelley Allison declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   IHS, without admitting wrongdoing, settled the Tipton case last year.
Most of the $5.3 million will pay for Tyler's medical care for the rest
of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government is the one having to foot the bill for all of
this," said Tyler's father, Jeff Tipton, a Choctaw tribal member. "For
what they spent they could have hired them some excellent doctors."</TE>

<DL>NKAYI, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>Jonas has not slept peacefully for six months. He wakes at the
slightest noise as he keeps vigil in a village he says has been cowed by
political violence ahead of this weekend's presidential elections.</LD>
<LD>   The human-rights activist was one of only two people in Nkayi, a
mostly rural region 100 miles north of Zimbabwe's second city of
Bulawayo, willing to talk to reporters.</LD>
<LD>   The run-up to this weekend's contest, which pits President Robert
Mugabe and his ruling ZANU-PF party against opposition Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai, has been marred by
political violence.</LD>
<TE>   Jonas, who declined to give his full name for fear of reprisal, said
gangs of pro-government youths had been beating up villagers perceived to
be Tsvangirai's supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "People are very afraid because of the violence they have witnessed
here. If these ZANU-PF youths see you talking to strangers they will
hassle you about why you are talking to them. Some people have been
beaten up and others have gone missing," Jonas said.</TE>
<TE>   Another villager said people in the area were also being forced to buy
ruling-party cards in order to get basic foodstuffs that were in short
supply.</TE>
<TE>   "If that man [Mugabe] wins, we are finished," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Former union leader Tsvangirai presents Mugabe's toughest challenge
since he won power at independence from Britain in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   His MDC has accused Mugabe and his ruling ZANU-PF party of attempting
to steal the election and attacking its supporters and sympathizers. It
also estimates that 107 of its activists have been killed over the past
two years.</TE>
<TE>   ZANU-PF has consistently denied it supports election violence and says
its own followers have been victims of attacks by opposition supporters.</TE>

<HD>Czechs Seek to Put a Face on Holocaust Victims</HD>
<DH>History: Due to the threat of the former Communist regime, little
is known about the fate of the country's Jews. But a new project seeks
answers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NADIA RYBAROVA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic
</DL>
<LD>For half a century, all that remained of Zikmund Winterstein was
his name and two dates: the day he was born, and the day he was
considered to have died.</LD>
<LD>   Winterstein and most of the 80,000 other Czech victims of the
Holocaust, whose names were painted decades ago on the inside walls of
Prague's Pinkas Synagogue, have languished in obscurity since the end of
World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Now a campaign is underway to put faces to the names of those who
perished in Nazi concentration camps.</LD>
<TE>   Over the past several months, major Czech newspapers have been
publishing ads calling on Czechs who may have documents or pictures of
Jews who never came back to make them available to the Jewish Museum in
Prague.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's director, Leo Pavlat, says the "Lost Neighbors" project
is an attempt to gather as much information on Czech Jews as possible
before those who still remember are gone.</TE>
<TE>   "About most of the victims, we know absolutely nothing. It's a pity
this was not done right after the war," Pavlat says.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes, however, that people may have long-forgotten papers or
pictures at home as well as documents that Jewish friends or neighbors
left with them before being sent away. Perhaps most important, he hopes
for "the memories those Jews left among their non-Jewish fellow
citizens."</TE>
<TE>   "We get some really nice letters," he says. "For example, one from a
woman who since the war has not been able to go to a street in which she
had several Jewish friends when she was a child" because she would be
overcome by emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 120,000 Jews lived in Czech territory before the war; 80,000
did not survive.</TE>
<TE>   Many Holocaust survivors tried to suppress their memories after the
war and refused to talk about their experience.</TE>
<TE>   After the communists came to power in Czechoslovakia in 1948, at least
18,000 Jews fled, and those who stayed were too afraid to openly
acknowledge their identity. Today, there are only about 3,500 Jews in the
Czech Republic, according to Jewish community registers.</TE>
<TE>   Czech efforts to shed light on the country's Holocaust victims have
lagged behind those of other nations. Even the Pinkas Synagogue memorial
has been neglected. It deteriorated so badly that it had to be closed in
1968 and wasn't reopened until 1996, after the demise of the communist
regime.</TE>
<TE>   Czech Jews hope "Lost Neighbors" will reawaken the nation to a
forgotten past.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very good project," says Peter Weiss, 47, a Jewish
psychologist whose mother survived the Auschwitz concentration camp.</TE>
<TE>   "It may cause many people to search not only for the history of Jews,
but also for the history of the place they live in. And it can also make
them think about how Czechs were behaving during the Holocaust."</TE>
<TE>   Although the drive to learn more about the victims is purely
domestic--the plea hasn't gone out to Czechs living abroad--it has
already succeeded in filling in some of the blanks about victims like
Zikmund Winterstein.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, all that was known was that he was born on Aug. 8,
1873, and left Prague in October 1941 in one of the first transports to
the ghetto in Lodz, Poland, from which many Jews were taken to death
camps. Because nothing else was known about Winterstein, his departure
from Prague was registered as the day he died.</TE>
<TE>   But documents and letters brought to the museum by a man whose
grandfather received them from a Jewish friend of Winterstein add a few
brush strokes to his life.</TE>
<TE>   A certificate of apprenticeship shows Winterstein was a tinsmith. His
correspondence to a travel agency reveals his last address was in Prague.
A receipt for 50 German marks sent to him by a relative suggests he may
still have been alive on May 6, 1942.</TE>
<TE>   Jana Splichalova, who heads the Jewish Museum's Holocaust department,
says cables from the travel agency to Winterstein and his wife, Anna,
show they apparently were making plans to emigrate to Cuba before they
were shipped to Lodz.</TE>
<TE>   The cables, dated Nov. 11, 1941, said Cuban visas were waiting for the
Wintersteins at the Cuban diplomatic mission in Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   They arrived too late. The Wintersteins had been put on a transport
bound for Lodz on Oct. 31.</TE>

<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The six soldiers stood at attention in the old Soviet airplane
hangar Friday to receive Purple Hearts, the medal reserved for Americans
wounded in combat.</LD>
<LD>   One was a helicopter pilot grazed in the head by shrapnel when a
rocket-propelled grenade shattered the cockpit of his aircraft. Others
were infantrymen caught in a terrifying 18-hour mortar assault on the
first day of Operation Anaconda in eastern Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The men were praised for their sacrifice and courage by a phalanx of
generals assembled in the leaky old building--a decrepit remnant of the
last foreign military force to operate in Afghanistan. But the emotional
ceremony also underscored a change in tactics that has put U.S. ground
troops square on the front lines in the war against Al Qaeda and Taliban
forces.</LD>
<TE>   Initially, American commanders had hoped that local Afghan fighters
would take the lead in the attack launched last weekend, with U.S. and
coalition forces assuming blocking positions outside.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the Afghans to go after these guys. It's their country," Maj.
Gen. Frank L. Hagenbeck told reporters in an operation briefing Feb. 26.</TE>
<TE>   But when the Afghan forces proved ineffective and the American
"blockers" came under immediate, intense fire, the plan was quickly
reversed.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Col. Joe Smith, chief of staff for the 10th Mountain
Division here at Bagram air base, said the attack forces were now
arranged in "concentric circles: Afghan forces on the outside and the
rest of coalition forces on the inside," like an anaconda suffocating its
prey.</TE>
<TE>   The results have been striking: According to U.S. commanders, more
than 500 "hardened Al Qaeda fighters" have been killed in six days of
ground fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Ground fire from the Al Qaeda and Taliban holdouts has eased in recent
days, officials said Friday at the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   But the Pentagon believes that perhaps 200 fighters are still
entrenched in the caves, tunnels and cliffsides, a senior Pentagon
official said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen sporadic firing, sporadic fighting" in the last several
days, said Air Force Brig. Gen. John W. Rosa Jr., deputy director of
operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "The fighting we saw in the
first day has not been as intense. But it's still a very dangerous
place."</TE>
<TE>   Rosa told reporters at the Pentagon that "a couple hundred" Al Qaeda
remain in the mountainous battlefield but said their losses appear to
have reduced their ability to organize defenses.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said foul weather had slowed the
pace of U.S. aerial bombing, but Rosa said later that the weather Friday
night in Afghanistan had improved.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa said U.S. aircraft, B-52 bombers, Navy fighter jets, Apache
attack helicopters and AC-130 gunships among them, had flown more than
200 missions Friday and dropped 75 bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld also said he expects the battle would last seven to 10 more
days. On Thursday, he said it could end as early as this weekend,
although in both instances he cautioned it is impossible to know for sure
how long the militant fighters will hold out.</TE>
<TE>   The battle against the holdouts has had a high price: It has resulted
in the highest level of U.S. dead and wounded in the Afghan war.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 43 men who landed in the Chinook helicopter with Army Sgt.
David Smith and other members of Charlie Company early Saturday morning,
12 were wounded. So far, eight Americans have died in Operation Anaconda,
with dozens more wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, all of us thought we were going to die," said Smith, of
Philadelphia, a squad team leader whose legs were gashed by a mortar
explosion and who was one of the Purple Heart recipients Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. fighters, set down in what they were told was a secure area,
spent most of the time dragging their fallen comrades to a series of
hiding places to avoid the incoming mortars until more troops transported
by two Black Hawk helicopters came to their aid under cover of night.</TE>
<TE>   Miraculously, none of the Americans was killed. A chaplain at the
Purple Heart ceremony offered a prayer for "keeping the men alive when
death was all around them."</TE>

<HD>U.S. General Urges Detainees in Cuba to Resume Eating</HD>
<DH>Military: The officer's translated assurances of fair treatment and
requests for cooperation will become a weekly occurrence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IAN JAMES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba
</DL>
<LD>With the number of hunger strikers declining, a U.S. Marine general
told captives of the war on terrorism Friday to cooperate with
interrogators and follow camp rules.</LD>
<LD>   "Refusing food and drink is not the answer," Brig. Gen. Michael
Lehnert said, his voice echoing over the loudspeaker of the detention
compound on the 10th day of a waning hunger strike. "You only punish
yourself."</LD>
<LD>   The commander of the compound known as Camp X-Ray spoke shortly after
21 men refused breakfast--down from a high of 194 refusing food a week
ago.</LD>
<TE>   He told detainees claiming they were not Taliban or Al Qaeda that they
will have their day in court.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of you have said you are innocent and that you are not Taliban
or Al Qaeda," Lehnert said. "To you I would say that America is a nation
of laws. Your case will be heard, and you will be judged fairly."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials are determining whether and how to prosecute the 300
men held at the naval base in southeastern Cuba. Those not tried by a
military tribunal could be prosecuted in U.S. courts, returned to their
home countries for prosecution, held indefinitely, or released outright.</TE>
<TE>   Lehnert told the men he couldn't say how long they would have to
remain at the base.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay are being treated at a
field hospital, many recovering from war wounds.</TE>
<TE>   The rest appeared to listen to Lehnert's speech inside their
chain-link cells. An Arabic translation followed over the loudspeakers,
and interpreters were on hand to translate the general's words into other
languages.</TE>
<TE>   "Within five weeks, all of you will be moved to another place nearby
where you will each have a bed, running water, a sink and a toilet,"
Lehnert said.</TE>
<TE>   Work recently began on a more permanent detention center to replace
Camp X-Ray, hastily built during the war on Afghanistan, and the first
408 cells are to be finished about April 12.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be an exercise area, and conditions will be better for
you," the general said.</TE>
<TE>   He also touched on recent improvements, noting that meals now include
hot tea, and that reading glasses would be given to those who need them.</TE>
<TE>   Lehnert warned that camp rules must be followed. "If you attack, or
talk back to a guard, you will be punished."</TE>
<TE>   "You must tell the truth during questioning. Then, and only then, will
we be able to determine who will be allowed to return home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The hunger strike--the first mass protest since detainees began
arriving at the base nearly two months ago--began Feb. 27 after guards
stripped an inmate of his turban during prayers.</TE>
<TE>   Lehnert said that guards have taken classes and are now better able to
tell when captives are practicing their religion.</TE>
<TE>   In urging all to resume eating, the general referred them to a verse
in the Koran, the sacred text of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "You must take care of yourselves and exercise patience, giving
yourself up to the will of Allah," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the general's second address to detainees, and he now plans to
speak to them on a weekly basis, said Marine Maj. Stephen Cox, a
spokesman. "It relieves tension," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, U.S. sailors raised a New York City flag at the entrance
to the camp as a reminder of those killed in the Sept. 11 attack on the
World Trade Center.</TE>

<HD>Poor South Africans Feather Nests</HD>
<DH>Culture: Using castoff materials to innovative ends, residents are
making the most of their humble quarters.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>KHAYELITSHA, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>Maphepheni Ncokotwane's home sounds palatial: two floors, six
bedrooms, leather panels on the walls, sweeping views.</LD>
<LD>   But like the hundreds of thousands of poor people in the sprawling
Khayelitsha suburb near Cape Town, the 53-year-old merchant lives in a
shack. Its relative sophistication is testimony to the flair for
innovation shown by some residents.</LD>
<LD>   An estimated 7.3 million South Africans lack proper shelter, a problem
dating from the apartheid era, when blacks were confined to the fringes
of the economy. They were kicked off prime land--which was reserved for
whites--and moved into remote rural homelands or townships on the
outskirts of cities and towns.</LD>
<TE>   The bulk of shacks are spartan one-room structures of wood, corrugated
iron and plastic, hastily nailed together at minimal expense.</TE>
<TE>   Amid these, however, are some remarkable displays of ingenuity. People
turn billboards into walls, old car tires into fences and flattened oil
cans into roof shingles.</TE>
<TE>   "People use materials in incredibly inventive ways," said Jo Noero,
director of the University of Cape Town's architecture school.</TE>
<TE>   The leather panels in Maphepheni's home are covers torn from old
diaries he found in a rubbish dump. They provide good insulation against
the southeasters that blast the sandy township streets.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want a brick house," he says, proudly displaying how the
second floor of his shack can hold up to 60 people for church meetings.</TE>
<TE>   The structure, which sits beneath a towering electricity pylon, took
four months to build. The second floor stands on a large, enclosed wooden
platform attached to beams suspended between a series of sturdy poles
cemented into the ground.</TE>
<TE>   In other shacks, colorful wallpaper is fashioned from pages torn from
old magazines, plastic bags weighted down with rocks are used to
waterproof leaky tin roofs and scrap metal is welded together to create
artistic divisions between tiny dirt yards.</TE>
<TE>   Noero believes there is a danger in celebrating the efforts of the
poor to provide shelter for themselves, saying it detracts from the
government's obligation to build new low-cost homes.</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of all-white rule, the government has built 1.2 million
houses, mostly one- or two-room brick structures that many residents
complain are too small and poorly constructed.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the program, housing shortages in many cities are worse than
ever. A survey by the Institute of Race Relations found rapid
urbanization between 1994 and 1999 resulted in about 653,000 new informal
dwellings springing up, an increase of 97%.</TE>
<TE>   With about one-third of South Africans unemployed, few people can
afford to build their own formal dwellings.</TE>
<TE>   "I want a beautiful and strong place, but I have little money," said
Zukili Ludidi, 22, who runs a barber shop in a flimsy wooden structure on
a Khayelitsha sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Vicky Ntozini, 32, makes the most of living in a shack. Since 1998,
she has run a bed and breakfast at her home, charging foreign tourists
150 rand ($13) a night for an authentic township experience, which
includes a meal of sheep's head and tripe.</TE>
<TE>   The shack's walls are lined with roughhewn logs--an original touch
based on sound financial logic.</TE>
<TE>   "It costs seven rand (60 cents) for a board, but only 2 rand (17
cents) for a log," Ntozini said.</TE>
<TE>   She and her mechanic husband plan to add a second floor to their
four-room shack when they have the time and money.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a lot of time to renovate, especially when you are living in
the place," she said. "You can have a dream, but if you don't have money
it can be a bit difficult to see it through."</TE>

<HD>Tourism Expected to Bring Sea Change to Lifestyle in Honduras</HD>
<DH>Culture: Some Indian tribal members fear negative impact as others
welcome potential economic opportunities.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TRIUNFO DE LA CRUZ, Honduras
</DL>
<LD>The gaunt teenager walked barefoot for days along narrow, muddy
paths and caught rides from an occasional passing car to reach the
nearest city.</LD>
<LD>   But the trip was worth it for Margarito Lored, a Garifuna fisherman
headed to a regional meeting aimed at preventing planeloads of tourists
from descending to sunbathe and party on the quiet beaches where his
people have lived for more than 200 years.</LD>
<LD>   Honduras, looking to generate tourism dollars, is searching for
investors for two resorts--one with 1,600 hotel rooms, two beach clubs, a
water park, a campground and an equestrian club--on its northern coast,
long home to the descendants of black slaves and Carib Indians known as
the Garifuna.</LD>
<TE>   For some Garifunas, the hotels and shops could mean fewer people will
have to work in the United States. For others, it is a threat to a way of
life that to an outsider's eye has changed little from generation to
generation.</TE>
<TE>   The Garifuna have adopted few Honduran traditions, maintaining their
own language, their own culture and their own closely linked communities.</TE>
<TE>   Former inhabitants of the free island of St. Vincent, they were
defeated by the British and deported to the island of Roatan off
Honduras' northern coast in 1797.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, they spread to settlements along the Caribbean coast in
Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Belize. They maintain their Garifuna
language--which is influenced by Arawak, French, English, Spanish and
various African languages--while also adopting Spanish and, in the case
of Belize, English.</TE>
<TE>   Experts estimate more than 160,000 Garifunas live in Central America,
and at least 50,000 have migrated to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Their culture is reliant on the sea. Their homes are built along the
beaches, or on stilts above the waves. Their children play soccer in the
ocean's shallows while men fish from dugout canoes or dive with spears
for fish along the reefs.</TE>
<TE>   But the same beaches that have served as a backbone to their culture
for generations could soon bring an entirely different way of life.</TE>
<TE>   A disease has killed most of the palm trees along the coast, robbing
residents of one of their main food sources--coconuts--while Hurricane
Mitch in 1998 forced many fishermen to sail hours out of their way to
find their catch.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no highways, and they are deforesting the land," Lored
said, arriving for a meeting to organize residents against encroaching
tourism.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Garifuna leaders say, residents are coming under
increasing pressure to sell their land to developers. In the coastal
village of Triunfo de la Cruz, 190 miles north of Tegucigalpa, the
capital, a few residents sold a yucca field because they didn't know they
had the right to say no, community leader Edgardo Benedeth said.</TE>
<TE>   "They think that if they don't sell the land, it will be stolen" and
they won't receive any money, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Once other villagers discovered what had happened, the yucca field was
already being plowed under and construction had begun on seven luxury
vacation homes, complete with swimming pools and two-story picture
windows. The community is fighting the construction in court and trying
to educate residents about their property rights.</TE>
<TE>   But that development is just the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Small hotels and restaurants are sprouting up nearby, and Honduran
officials are searching for foreign investors for a multimillion-dollar
resort located in the swamps next to the Garifuna village of Tornabe, 12
miles to the west.</TE>
<TE>   A similar resort is being planned 100 miles to the east, amid several
Garifuna villages.</TE>
<TE>   "We have hundreds of kilometers of beaches that aren't developed, and
it's a waste," Tourism Secretary Ana Abarca said in Tegucigalpa. "We want
strong tourism. We are going after the sun and the beach."</TE>
<TE>   Although government officials say the resorts will include day tours
of Garifuna villages, community leaders want to develop sustainable,
small-scale ecotourism--and not become sideshows to giant resorts with
spring breakers and water parks, said Miriam Miranda of the Central
Office of the Fraternal Black Organization in Honduras.</TE>
<TE>   "They are just going to come to take pictures and dance," she said of
future tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Government leaders have agreed to help the Garifuna build walking
paths between some villages, possibly helping residents attract people
interested in taking cultural tours.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to happen; the question is how to prepare," said
Natividad Rochez, the Tourism Ministry's coordinator of ethnic projects
and himself a Garifuna.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Chavez, 72, hired to rake a beach outside a Canadian-owned
hotel for $1.30 a hour, welcomed the idea of more tourism in the hopes
that he might be able to get a better job. He already has been forced to
give up his life's work.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no fish," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But tourism hasn't always been good to the Garifuna. Community leaders
say residents often are offered only menial jobs--if any.</TE>
<TE>   On the island of Roatan, the isolated community of Punta Gorda has
become reliant on the occasional busload of visitors who make the nearly
two-hour trip from the trendy restaurants, bars and hotels of the West
End.</TE>
<TE>   Residents there say they'd like to have some resorts nearby so more
tourists come. The appearance of one or two foreigners brings people
running from their wooden homes with homemade crafts while others offer
to prepare curry-flavored soups or put together an impromptu traditional
dance.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want to see the Garifunas, she gets the boys to beat the
drums," Eludia Honk said, pointing to her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Yet most come to the island to dive, and even full-time residents say
Punta Gorda has little to offer, despite the community's pristine beach
and undisturbed coral.</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty much they just make bread and dance. That's pretty much the
extent of their talents," Sunni Bergess, manager of the Mermaid Beach
Cabins, told an Idaho family one evening.</TE>

<HD>Big-Game Hunting Threatening Parks</HD>
<DH>Africa: A Tanzania company is accused of altering migratory
patterns of animals in the region to benefit business.</DH>

<DL>LOLIONDO GAME CONTROL AREA, Tanzania
</DL>
<LD>At a dirt airstrip in rural Tanzania, a desert camouflaged cargo
plane from the United Arab Emirates air force taxis up to pallets stacked
with large coolers full of game meat, the harvest of a successful hunting
season.</LD>
<LD>   As Tanzanian immigration and customs officials fill out documents
under a thatched shelter, new, four-wheel-drive trucks and dune buggies
drive to and from a nearby luxury campsite, the base for one of
Tanzania's most expensive--and secretive--game-hunting operations,
Otterlo Business Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of members of Arab royalty and high-flying businessmen spend
weeks in the Loliondo Game Control Area each year hunting antelope, lion,
leopard and other wild animals. The area is leased under the Otterlo name
by a member of an emirate royal family who is a senior officer in the UAE
defense ministry.</LD>
<TE>   Although neighboring Kenya outlawed big-game hunting in 1978, the
Tanzanian government says hunting is the best use of the land and
wildlife. But villagers and herders say big money has led government
officials to break all the hunting rules, resulting in the destruction of
most of the area's non-migratory animals and putting East Africa's most
famous national parks under threat.</TE>
<TE>   Loliondo is on the main migratory route for wildlife north of
Ngorongoro Crater, east of Serengeti National Park and south of Kenya's
sprawling Masai Mara National Reserve.</TE>
<TE>   The summer hunting season coincides with the migration of wildebeest
and zebra through the area, where they eventually cross into the
Serengeti and the Masai Mara. Predatory animals follow the migration.</TE>
<TE>   During the colonial era, Loliondo was set aside for European royalty
as a hunting area. Since independence, Loliondo has remained a hunting
reserve, but it is supposed to be managed by area residents for their
benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Local leaders, who refuse to speak publicly because they fear
retribution, say they were not consulted about the lease granted in 1995
by national officials in Tanzania's political capital, Dodoma. They say
that government officials have tried to silence criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "The lease was given by the government and the Maasai landowners were
not involved," said one Maasai leader. "All the resident animals have
been killed. . . . [Now] they carry out hunting raids in the Serengeti
National Park, but the government closes its eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Maasai warriors told Associated Press that hunters give cash to anyone
who can lead them to big game, especially leopards. They also said that
Otterlo officials have pumped water into some areas to attract more
animals and that what the warriors call suspicious fires in the Serengeti
have caused animals to move into Loliondo.</TE>
<TE>   An Otterlo manager, who gave his name only as Khamis, initially agreed
to an interview with AP but later did not return repeated phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the newspaper, the East African, Otterlo managing
director Juma Akida Zodikheri said his company adheres to Tanzanian law,
and he denied hunters killed animals indiscriminately. He said the owner
of the company is Maj. Gen. Mohammed Abdulrahim al Ali, deputy defense
minister of the UAE.</TE>
<TE>   Although Tanzania has strict rules on game hunting, Maasai who have
worked at the lodge say guests are never told of the limits and hunt as
much as they want. Tanzanian officials deny that.</TE>
<TE>   Col. A.G.N. Msangi, district commissioner for Ngorongoro District,
said all applicable rules are enforced. He accused the Maasai of being a
rumormonger in an effort to discredit Otterlo.</TE>
<TE>   The company "is following the system the government wants," Msangi
said. "OBC has invested more money here than any other company in the
district."</TE>
<TE>   Msangi said hunting companies request permission to kill a certain
number of animals. Once the request is approved by wildlife experts at
the Ministry of the Environment, the company pays a fee based on that
number whether they actually kill the animals or not, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have police and ministry people making sure they don't exceed what
they have paid for," Msangi said. The tourists are also required to
employ professional hunters to ensure no female or young animals are
killed, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with the numbers in Serengeti National Park, very few large
animals were seen during a three-hour drive through Loliondo. But without
any independent survey of the animal population, it is impossible to know
whether Msangi's conservation efforts are working.</TE>
<TE>   Msangi described his main duty as balancing the needs of people,
animals and conservation. He said not only does hunting revenue finance
wildlife conservation, but Otterlo, like most tourism companies, also
makes charitable donations to help pay for schools and development
projects and it provides much needed jobs.</TE>

<HD>Self-Mutilation Syndrome Also Scars Victims' Self-Image</HD>
<DH>Psychology: So-called cutters are usually women who are reacting to
sexual attacks or feelings of inadequacy, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA IRVINE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MOUNT PLEASANT, Mich.
</DL>
<LD>Long sleeves couldn't hide the secret--not from her parents and a
college roommate, who began to notice inconsistencies in the stories she
made up about her scars.</LD>
<LD>   Now Elizabeth Franas is going public with her problem and even gearing
her studies at Central Michigan University to prepare for research that
could eventually help her and others.</LD>
<LD>   Franas is a "cutter," a commonly used term for the estimated hundreds
of thousands of people who injure themselves regularly--and deeply enough
to draw blood--in times of stress, anxiety and depression. Some have
called the practice the anorexia of a new generation, particularly for
girls who seem to have a hard time expressing anger and frustration.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't know how to verbalize our pain, so we write it on our
bodies," says Franas, who is almost 20 and finishing her sophomore year.
"I bleed it out instead of talking it out."</TE>
<TE>Uses Whatever Objects Are Available</TE>
<TE>   She's used everything from broken glass and staples to her own
fingernails to draw blood on her arm, belly and hip--inexplicably, all on
her left side.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, Franas occasionally gives in to the urge to cut herself with
razor blades, thought to be the most common way cutters and other
self-injurers hurt themselves. For some, the alarming trend also includes
biting, burning and even self-strangulation (generally without the
intention of suicide).</TE>
<TE>   It is a quiet and often shame-filled obsession.</TE>
<TE>   "You think you're the only one. You feel like you're absolutely
crazy," says Franas, who has also been diagnosed with an eating disorder
and obsessive-compulsive disorder, both common diagnoses among
self-injurers.</TE>
<TE>   A trip to the hospital for stitches--one of three since she's been at
college--revealed her secret to her roommate and a dorm advisor. Their
support prompted her to slowly start sharing it with others. And she
found she was far from alone.</TE>
<TE>   "Literally every person I talked to knew someone like me," she says.</TE>
<TE>More Common Than Many Think</TE>
<TE>   Steven Levenkron, a New York psychotherapist who treats cutters, says
that's not surprising. He used to believe that one of every 250 people
was a self-injurer.</TE>
<TE>   "But in interviewing school guidance counselors, they literally laugh
at me," says Levenkron, author of several books on cutting, anorexia and
obsessive-compulsive disorder. "They're saying one out of 50, [or] one
out of 100."</TE>
<TE>   Levenkron says therapy and prescription drugs, including
antidepressants, have helped his patients subdue urges to hurt
themselves. About 80% of his patients are girls and young women. Although
the source of their anger has many sources, he says, as many as 70% have
been molested.</TE>
<TE>   Despite successes, he and others note that help for self-injurers can
be difficult to find, or at the very least expensive, in a profession
that is grappling with its own misconceptions of the disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Levenkron says some therapists are afraid cutters will kill
themselves. "But this is not a suicide attempt. They all assume they will
live to cut again," he says, noting that the cuts are generally less than
an inch long.</TE>
<TE>   Support groups for cutters have formed at some schools, including
Central Michigan and Bryn Mawr College. But they are still the exception,
partly because shame keeps some students from coming forward.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still so underground," says Franas, who began speaking at public
forums on the issue last year.</TE>
<TE>   A psychology major, she's also taking upper-level courses in
neuroscience and is among the youngest students helping with Parkinson's
and Huntington's disease research at the university's Brain Research
Laboratory. It's all part of her plan to eventually do research on
self-injuring.</TE>
<TE>   She's also writing a memoir for her senior honors project, which
she'll complete in two years. "I've learned that I can get my emotions
out with a pen," says Franas, who has reduced her cutting from one to
three times a day to once "every couple months."</TE>
<TE>   Her parents, who live about two hours south in suburban Detroit, are
both pleased with her progress and astounded by her decision to go
public.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'It's going to be like coming out of the closet for a gay
person back in the old days,' " her father, Ben Franas, says. "But she
said, 'I'm ready to do this, Dad.' "</TE>
<TE>   This from the daughter they dragged from therapist to therapist after
her mom first saw deep scratches on her shoulder in late 1999, as Franas
was getting out of the shower.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time they found out, my dad cried," says Franas, who was a
high school senior at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the question that was tough to answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do you do this?" asked her parents, who had never heard of
cutting.</TE>
<TE>   She was, after all, a good student and an accomplished gymnast with a
dream of competing at the college level.</TE>
<TE>   But her parents had been consumed by the emotional troubles of their
older daughter, Tara, and didn't realize that their younger had developed
an eating disorder. Tara eventually worked things out, after an ordeal of
her own: She told her parents she'd been raped but was too scared to
reveal it to them for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>Strong Feelings of Isolation Grew</TE>
<TE>   The family turmoil took its toll on the younger Franas, leaving her
feeling ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "My sister was running the family," says Franas, whose eating disorder
began to sap her strength and ability to train for six hours a day. "It
wasn't her fault, but there wasn't much left for me."</TE>
<TE>   Then Franas' much-loved gymnastics coach decided to return to Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the beginning of the downfall for Elizabeth," her dad says.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to hold herself together to train, the self-described
"adrenaline junkie" quit the sport--and, with that, lost her stress
outlet and her dream.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like an animal in a caged box that's trying to get out," she
says. "That's pretty much what it felt like."</TE>
<TE>   The feeling led her to repeatedly dig her fingernails into her arm.
Six months later, she started cutting and ended up spending the rest of
her senior year studying at home.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of friends gave up on me really quickly," she says, recalling
one boyfriend who told her to quit to prove her love.</TE>
<TE>   "As if it was about him," she says, rolling her eyes.</TE>
<TE>Looking for a Fresh Start</TE>
<TE>   As rough as it got, Franas stuck with plans to go to college--a move
her parents nervously supported.</TE>
<TE>   "At home, my identity was gymnastics," says Franas, whose bedroom in
her parents' house is still filled with medals and trophies. "Here, I
could start again."</TE>
<TE>   She has since found a therapist she likes and, last year, made the
decision to take medication. Through it all, she says, family and a few
close friends have stuck with her.</TE>
<TE>   "I've tested their support, pushed them away," she says. "But they
say, 'I'm going to be there for you, like it or not.' "</TE>
<TE>   She's also slowly letting go of the gymnast image.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a writer. I'm a good student. I'm a good friend," she says. "I'm
slowly learning to take that in."</TE>
<TE>   And maybe she'll be a researcher who's able to help those like her.</TE>
<TE>   "I may not cut every day, but that urge will always be there," she
says. "I know I'm going to be dealing with this for the rest of my life."</TE>
<TE>   'We don't know how to verbalize our pain, so we write it on our
bodies. I bleed it out instead of talking it out."</TE>

<HD>Warning Leaves Boomers Weak-Kneed</HD>
<DH>Health: Doctors say patients who have undergone joint replacements
must scale back exercise options.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRA DREYFUSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Exercising baby boomers must realize new knees are not like new
tires: You can't just wear out one set and buy another.</LD>
<LD>   Active middle-aged patients with arthritic knees should try switching
to lower-impact activities before deciding on surgical replacement of the
joint, orthopedic surgeons say. If they have surgery, patients should
realize that tennis, basketball and a daily run may be out afterward.</LD>
<LD>   What to do with patients who insist on doing things they love, even if
it endangers compromised joints, was the subject of a presentation at the
American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons' annual meeting in Dallas in
February.</LD>
<TE>   "People are healthier and more active into their 60s, and they expect
to be more active," said Dr. Arlen Hanssen of the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., who moderated the program. "You can't do everything,
but a lot of people attempt that."</TE>
<TE>   The surgery often is done to relieve pain and improve joint movement
that deteriorates due to osteoarthritis. In this condition, cartilage on
the bone surfaces inside the joint wears away, and the leg bones rub
against each other. Doctors remove the joint and put in a
metal-and-plastic replacement. The joint surfaces are cemented to the
bones, or the bones are allowed to grow through mesh surfaces on the
replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Potential patients might avoid surgery by switching to activities that
put less impact on their damaged joints, Hanssen said. This conservative
approach could be the best alternative, potentially preserving their
knees while letting them continue activity that is healthful for the rest
of their bodies, he said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300,000 knee replacements are done each year, and most work
out quite well, Hanssen said. But the first ones are the best, because
each subsequent operation opens the possibility of more scarring and bone
loss, he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 95% of first-time knee patients think the results are good or
excellent, but the percentage drops with each subsequent operation,
Hanssen said. The subsequent operations have higher risks of scarring
that can lead to stiffness.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, patients will be honest after knee-replacement surgery, but
sometimes not. "It's hard to know who is doing what," Hanssen said. "Some
are very honest and will point-blank say, 'I'm still playing singles
tennis.' Others, I believe they are not truthful. I've observed patients
doing things I've told them not to."</TE>
<TE>   There are no reliable demographics on who will listen and who will
not. But in Hanssen's experience, racquet-sports players are among the
more bullheaded. Tennis players don't want to give up something they see
as part sport and part social activity, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aging athletes need to expand their horizons or change their patterns,
or both, doctors say. The goal is to stay active and get the health
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Nicholas Di Nubile of Haverton, Pa., team physician for the NBA's
Philadelphia 76ers, recommends runners switch to biking, walking and
using an elliptical trainer, a machine that uses a low-impact sliding
motion.</TE>
<TE>   Weight training can help keep the knee stable by strengthening the
muscles around it, Di Nubile said.</TE>
<TE>   As for tennis, with its dashes and turns, players should at least
substitute gentle doubles for tough singles, he recommended.</TE>
<TE>   But not all doctors agree that boomers with artificial knees have to
give up what they love. Dr. Norman Scott, chairman of orthopedics at Beth
Israel Medical Center in New York, is one of them. "We let people play
tennis. We let the good skiers ski. I have people who were skaters. I let
them skate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   They may have to cut back, to engage in their sport for fun instead of
conditioning, Scott said. But the pain of arthritis probably had made
them cut back before they opted for knee replacement, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for replacing the replacement, Scott noted that the odds that the
patient will leave very happy with the results drop with each subsequent
operation. However, "there is nothing people can do to destroy their
knees so much that we can't put a replacement in," he said.</TE>

<HD>Lethal Means Explored to Fend Off Birds' Predators</HD>
<DH>Nature: Wildlife experts say crows, ravens and foxes may pay the
ultimate price if they prey on snowy plovers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BANDON, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>Federal wildlife experts say the snowy plover is endangered because
their eggs are being eaten by birds, skunks, feral cats, raccoons and red
foxes. This month they will start allowing the killing of plover
predators.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Mangan, a senior wildlife biologist with the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management, which oversees much of Oregon's plover habitat, acknowledged
the plan is controversial with biologists and among land managers.</LD>
<LD>   "But we've tried as much as we can with nonlethal means in the past,"
he said. "And we've come to the conclusion that we really can't recover
the species in Oregon without more predator management."</LD>
<TE>   The decision authorizes methods such as shooting, poisoning,
euthanizing trapped animals and destroying nests and eggs of airborne
predators. The plan urges that nonlethal alternatives be fully explored
before killing begins, however.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists and others have struggled to protect the nests, finding as
many as possible and surrounding them with large wire exclosures to keep
out airborne predators.</TE>
<TE>   But the predators often find their way in, or kill the fledgling
plovers when they make their way out.</TE>
<TE>   The main culprits are crows, said Mark Stern of the Nature
Conservancy's Oregon Natural Heritage Program. He said crows and ravens
sit on the edge of the exclosures, then drop between the wires, which are
about 4 inches apart.</TE>
<TE>   According to the environmental assessment, crows and ravens accounted
for more than 40% of the predator-caused nest failures along the Oregon
Coast over a 10-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Frounfelker, a Siuslaw National Forest wildlife biologist, says
he would like to try nonlethal means, such as electrifying the wires on
the top of the exclosures.</TE>
<TE>   Mangan said the last resort would be poison.</TE>
<TE>   Foxes and other four-legged predators would be caught in "soft"
leg-hold traps, Mangan said. Except for feral cats, trapped animals would
most likely be euthanized rather than relocated, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The cats would probably be taken to nearby humane societies. None of
the lethal measures would be used in areas where humans or pets might be
endangered, he said.</TE>
<TE>   There have been some public objections to the plan, including
arguments that predators are being made a scapegoat for plover losses
that could be better addressed through habitat improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Mangan and Stern agreed that measures such as improving habitat and
reducing conflicts with human activity are important, but they also see
better predator control as an important part of the effort.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Williams is director of the Portland wildlife services office of
the Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,
which will contract for the control work.</TE>
<TE>   He said he expects more protests after predator killing begins, noting
that some people object to killing any wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   How much the new predator-control program will help the plover
recovery remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Mangan hopes it will lead to more nests that produce fledglings, and
more fledglings that survive the month between hatching and the time
they're able to fly.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't do this if we didn't think there was good chance for
success," he said.</TE>

<HD>Lax Physician Oversight Threatens Care for American Indians</HD>
<DH>Health: Doctors who have records as sex offenders or sub-par
credentials are cleared to work in tribal hospitals.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Dr. Thomas W. Michaelis spent two months in an Ohio prison in 1991
for trying to molest four teenage girls.</LD>
<LD>   He then worked for eight years as an obstetrician-gynecologist in an
Indian Health Service hospital in Arizona, paid $101,000 a year by the
government despite a law barring the hiring of sex offenders in agencies
serving American Indians.</LD>
<LD>   IHS officials fired Michaelis last year. By then, he had examined
hundreds of women at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center after registering
with local authorities as a sex offender.</LD>
<TE>   Michaelis said he told IHS officials about his convictions for
attempted molestation, but the agency hired him in 1993 anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew about it up front," Michaelis said. "I guess they needed a
doctor eight years ago."</TE>
<TE>   At least 21 doctors who worked for the IHS between 1996 and 2001 have
been punished or denied licenses by state medical boards for offenses
ranging from abusing drugs to neglecting patients who later died, an
Associated Press review of disciplinary records found.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at IHS, the federal agency charged with providing care to
1.5 million American Indians, acknowledge that background checks on their
doctors are often inadequate. It's just one of many problems they blame
on a lack of money.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, there is no secretarial staff to support the medical
staff activities," said Dr. Craig Vanderwagen, the agency's chief medical
officer.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of our people are seeing 40 patients a day or so. Then, your
attention to take care of that [background check] paperwork goes right
out the window," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several sanctioned doctors told AP that IHS officials knew about their
backgrounds before they were hired. Documents from the State Medical
Board of Ohio show the IHS requested, and Ohio sent, records detailing
Michaelis' crimes.</TE>
<TE>   IHS officials rejected a Freedom of Information Act request from AP
for records detailing what they knew before Michaelis was hired.
Likewise, IHS officials declined to discuss any specific disciplined
doctors, citing privacy concerns.</TE>
<TE>   IHS managers have the power to hire doctors despite past troubles as
they try to fill vacancies that include more than 10% of their physician
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Vanderwagen said recruiting IHS doctors is often difficult, especially
for relatively low-paying jobs on the most remote, poverty-ravaged Indian
reservations.</TE>
<TE>   Records show about 2.6% of IHS doctors have been punished by state
boards--a rate more than four times the average for all government
doctors and the highest of any federal agency.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, just 0.5% of doctors who provide care to military
veterans at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals have ever been
disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   The IHS discipline rate is about the same as the national average for
all doctors. But critics say the federal agency has an obligation to do
better--especially because Indians have suffered from substandard health
care for more than a century and are vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   "There are perpetrators out there who tend to look for the state or
county or federal systems that have loopholes," said Yvette Joseph-Fox,
executive director of the National Indian Health Board, which represents
tribal health officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been haunted by these problems for more than a hundred years .
. . and for some strange reason, the perpetrators know that," she said.</TE>
<TE>21 Doctors Singled Out</TE>
<TE>   AP identified 21 disciplined IHS doctors through state medical board
files and a database of punished doctors compiled by the consumer
watchdog group Public Citizen.</TE>
<TE>   IHS doctors need only be licensed to practice medicine in one state,
and not necessarily the one where they work.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Michaelis relied on his Ohio medical license even though
Arizona rejected his application. That means the only place Michaelis
could practice in Arizona was a federal facility like an IHS hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael D. Cerny's medical licenses have been revoked, denied or
suspended in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa and Illinois for drug problems and
for tearing a woman's bladder during a hysterectomy, according to records
from the states' medical boards.</TE>
<TE>   Cerny now practices at the IHS hospital in Pine Ridge, S.D., earning
more than $103,000 a year. He holds a valid medical license in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Cerney said a fellow surgeon tore the woman's
bladder, not him. As for the drug problems, he admitted a history of
addiction to amphetamines. He said he sought treatment, as the hospital
employing him demanded.</TE>
<TE>   "Afterward, they would give me a good reference and mention nothing of
my prior history," he said. "That has come back to haunt me I don't know
how many times."</TE>
<TE>   His current employer, Pine Ridge hospital administrator Vern Donnell,
did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>History of Sex With Patients</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Paula J. Colescott surrendered her Colorado medical license in
1995 after she admitted having sex with a 19-year-old patient, according
to Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners records. She also was
reprimanded in 1991 for a similar sexual relationship with another
patient, medical board records show.</TE>
<TE>   Colescott, who now makes $98,310 a year at the Alaska Native Medical
Center in Anchorage, said she was upset by news coverage of the 1995
case.</TE>
<TE>   "So you're going to publish again, and publicly humiliate me again?"
Colescott said when interviewed. "You never let it die, do you guys? No,
I am not willing to comment."</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, Paul Sherry, chief executive of the tribal
consortium that runs the Alaska hospital, said Colescott "meets all of
the requirements of the Medical Bylaws and Rules and Regulations to
practice as a licensed physician."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Richard Chilian, a surgeon, had his North Dakota license suspended
in 1997 and then reinstated with restrictions after he took 20 tablets of
the antidepressant Wellbutrin and became so disoriented that he couldn't
complete a surgery, according to North Dakota medical board records.</TE>
<TE>   Chilian now makes $90,549 at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center. He
said the North Dakota incident resulted from depression and IHS officials
knew that.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew all about it, 100%," Chilian said. "There was never any
attempt to cover things up."</TE>

<HD>College Hopefuls Feel Push to Start Early</HD>
<DH>Education: Competition forces students to pick their schools too
soon, critics say. And even then, applicants may be left hanging.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARLENE LEVINSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>METUCHEN, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>William Hoffman started his college search in 10th grade. By the
start of his senior year last fall, he knew his first choice was Harvard.
The school even sent him a letter encouraging him to apply.</LD>
<LD>   So Hoffman, ranked third academically at Metuchen High School in
northern New Jersey, applied early to Harvard last October and did the
same with the University of Chicago, as a fallback. But months later,
Hoffman still doesn't know where he'll go to college--illustrating just
one of the problems critics find with early admission.</LD>
<LD>   The practice has become a powerful draw in a market where colleges
covet the best candidates and students pursue a belief that the better
the diploma, the better their future.</LD>
<TE>   But some critics, including Yale's president, say it can force
teenagers into premature decisions and gives unfair advantage to those
with money and admissions know-how. It also stretches the wait for people
like Hoffman.</TE>
<TE>   Early admission was first used in the 1950s by elite colleges, but the
practice spread about a decade ago. Now more than 400 colleges and
universities invite high school seniors to apply ahead of the crowd, a
College Board survey found.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, these schools offer "early decision," which requires those
admitted to withdraw applications elsewhere, or nonbinding "early
action," offered by both Harvard and Chicago. Some offer both.</TE>
<TE>   Of 1.2 million applicants for the freshman class of 2000, about
163,000 sought early admission--nearly 14%, the College Board found.</TE>
<TE>   Yale President Richard Levin has called for an end to early
admissions, and has floated the idea to the school's governing board and
fellow college presidents. (Last fall, 2,118 youngsters applied under
Yale's binding early decision--a 17% increase from the previous year--and
550 got in.)</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure admissions has brought to America's teenagers is pretty
substantial," Levin said. Early admission only makes it worse, he
believes.</TE>
<TE>   Ostensibly, early admission serves people like Hoffman, who began
senior year ready to apply. But it also helps colleges secure a chunk of
the freshman class and burnish their image as selective.</TE>
<TE>   "My sense is that the universities and colleges that practice early
admission have focused mainly on the advantages that practice brings
them," Levin said. They "haven't listened sufficiently to parents,
students, counselors and principals about the adverse effects."</TE>
<TE>   Growing rivalry for admission to places like Yale, which will enroll
some 1,300 freshmen next fall, compels too many teens to pick a first
choice too soon, Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   For those rejected in the early round, it prolongs the preoccupation
with entry to a good school, he said. Now those students must wait until
March and April, the peak for regular admissions.</TE>
<TE>   Levin also echoes those who say early admission favors rich families
that don't need to shop for the most affordable college, and gives an
edge to kids at schools with counselors who can closely oversee
applications.</TE>
<TE>   Recent research seems to support another suspicion, which schools
deny: applying early improves a candidate's odds.</TE>
<TE>   Two Harvard professors and a former Wesleyan University official
looked at 14 selective colleges and found that among students with
comparable credentials, applying early was equal to raising their SAT
score about 100 points.</TE>
<TE>   But defenders call early admission efficient. They say problems occur
only when it's used to fill too many slots.</TE>
<TE>   Dartmouth College admissions dean Karl Furstenberg admits no more than
a third of the school's 1,050 freshman by early decision. "The concept
makes sense if the college operates it responsibly and thoughtfully," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard accepted 1,174 students under early action this year,
potentially 71% of next fall's 1,650 freshmen. Based on past patterns,
admissions director Marlyn McGrath Lewis expects up to 20% of those
accepted early to enroll elsewhere.</TE>

<HD>Cervical Cancer Cuts Swath Along Border</HD>
<DH>Southwest: With medical checkups rare, thousands of women are at
risk from a disease that's largely been eradicated elsewhere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN BREZOSKY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WESLACO, Texas
</DL>
<LD>Neighbors of Maria Guadalupe Hernandez call her "la flaquita," the
thin one.</LD>
<LD>   She was sick when she sneaked across the border from Mexico five years
ago, penniless from paying doctors who misdiagnosed her cervical cancer.</LD>
<LD>   "I had to sell my house to pay medical bills in Mexico," she said in
Spanish during an interview in her hospital room. "The children were
hungry."</LD>
<TE>   She is still battling the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez represents a statistic that continues to baffle and shame
health officials. At 35, the mother of eight and grandmother of two
likely will die from a cancer that health officials say should have been
eradicated decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   For women around the world, the Pap smear has detected cell
abnormalities that can be treated long before they develop into cancer.</TE>
<TE>   But mortality rates have held frustratingly steady in some regions
plagued by poverty, language barriers and young motherhood. The rates
indicate that women are not getting the Pap test or are not pursuing
follow-up care when the tests show abnormalities.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-county U.S.-Mexico border area known as the Rio Grande Valley
is one of those regions. Other trouble spots include five counties in
Maine; 14 counties in rural Alabama; a chunk of West Virginia; parts of
California; and concentrations of Native Americans in the Southwest and
Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   Worldwide, almost 360,000 cases of cervical cancer were detected in
1990, with 190,000 women dying of the disease. Women in Third World
countries have relatively high incidence of sexually transmitted
diseases, including the human papilloma virus that is a precursor to
cervical cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The Rio Grande is hardly a boundary when it comes to health issues.
Young doctors training in crowded hospitals here may encounter diseases
seen nowhere else in the country, including dengue fever and canine
rabies.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing this, the federal health department is funding basic
health needs including reproductive care, vaccinations for children and
treatment for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis.</TE>
<TE>   There also is a lack of education about preventive care. Women with no
health insurance who are isolated by language and culture may go years
without seeing a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw one woman who was over 50 years old and having her first Pap,"
said Sister Mary Nicholas, a registered nurse with the Texas Department
of Health's regional office.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the cancer is caught, it's often far advanced. The
incidence rate for cervical cancer in the Rio Grande between 1995 and
1997 was 13.6 per 100,000 women. From 1994 to 1998, that figure was 8.5
per 100,000 women nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Just as much a factor is a failure at continuing care. Even when a Pap
smear comes back abnormal, a woman may forego the follow-up. The results
are a regional mortality rate at 3.8 per 100,000, compared to 2.3 per
100,000 nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "They may be afraid; they don't want to know they're sick. But the
message we have to convey is: 'Get that Pap,' " said Jane Delgado,
president and CEO of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health and author
of "Salud," a health guide for Hispanic women.</TE>
<TE>   The National Cancer Institute is generating a report on the
disproportionate rates of cervical cancer around the United States and
what can be done about them.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifty years after the introduction of the Pap smear, which should
eliminate cervical cancer, we still had these high rates in these
counties," said NCI's Dr. Jon Kerner, who is working with several
agencies to eradicate the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act
passed by Congress last year, states are eligible for federal Medicaid
matching funds to provide free medical care to low-income women diagnosed
with breast or cervical cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Texas plans to take advantage of the initiative. A state law that went
into effect Sept. 1 provides free breast and cervical cancer treatment to
women who have no insurance but whose incomes are too high for Medicaid.</TE>
<TE>   The effort may come too late for Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   Tucked here and there along the border are "colonias"--settlements of
mostly poor Mexican nationals that take root wherever a landowner allows
trailers, old school buses or flimsy shacks.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, community outreach workers known as "promotoras" have
tried to get colonia residents in touch with health care and other
services.</TE>
<TE>   One such "promotora" found Hernandez in a cinder-block shack last May,
lying nearly unconscious on the floor in a pool of blood.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably the most advanced cervical cancer any of us had
seen," said Dr. Hhabib Ghaddar, an oncologist. "Frankly, any cervical
cancer is advanced because we shouldn't be seeing invasive cervical
cancer at all."</TE>
<TE>   Media reports about Hernandez prompted an outpouring of donated
clothes and toys for the children--the youngest is 3, the eldest 17. The
county helped move the family into a rental house. Health officials saw
to it that the children were immunized so they could attend school.</TE>
<TE>   But within months, the money was running out and Hernandez moved the
children into a trailer. The cost: roughly $250 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the disease has left Hernandez weakened, often unable to eat.
The children have been sent home from school with lice. They share one
mattress on the floor. The only shower is an outside garden hose.</TE>
<TE>   An account opened by Texas State Bank in Hernandez's name recently had
a balance of $6.</TE>

<HD>Study of Newborns Has Ugly Results</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MORIN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looks matter, even at birth--particularly for babies born
prematurely, according to nursing professors Lina Kurdahi Badr of UCLA
and Bahia Abdallah of the University of Balamand in Lebanon.</LD>
<LD>   Badr and Abdallah found that premature infants considered by the
nursing staff to be attractive "thrive better as measured by weight gain
by discharge and length of hospital stay than those who are perceived as
less attractive, presumably because they receive more nurturing." They
reported their results in the publication Infant Behavior and
Development.</LD>
<LD>   It's a deeply troubling finding--so troubling that many nurses don't
want to hear it, Badr said. "They want to say, 'We don't do that; we
treat all babies the same.' "</LD>
<TE>   But many don't, Badr said--a point she drills into the nursing
students in her child development classes.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers tracked the progress of 56 babies born prematurely at
two hospitals in Beirut. The infants had no congenital problems and were
generally healthy. Twenty nurses rated the physical appeal of each infant
on a scale ranging from 1 ("very attractive") to 5 ("very unattractive").</TE>
<TE>   Even after Badr and Abdallah controlled for the babies' birth weight
and overall health, they found the "cutest" babies fared "significantly"
better, gaining much more weight than the "least attractive" infants and
spending, on average, two to three fewer days in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually from the start, Badr faced obstacles that delayed but did
not derail the study. Hospitals in the United States would not permit her
to conduct research in their neonatal care units. Administrators "don't
want to hear that their nurses pay less attention to some babies because
of the way they look," she said. So she decided to do the study in her
native Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers got an equally chilly reception when they attempted to
publish their findings in scholarly journals. "They didn't doubt my
results," she said. "They didn't want me to use the words
'less-attractive' babies" or other phrases that suggested looks mattered.</TE>
<TE>   Badr said she wasn't surprised by the results. "I have worked
extensively in neonatal units" in the United States and abroad, she said.
"I saw that nurses played much longer with the cuter babies, held them
longer and spent longer feeding them."</TE>
<TE>   Still, her findings bothered her.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really upsetting," Badr said. "It's not fair. What if you have
an ugly kid?"</TE>

<HD>Panting Polar Bears Getting Animal Advocates Steamed Up</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Use of arctic creatures in tropical climate raises ire of
PETA activists, who say they are being mistreated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATY DAIGLE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>JUANA DIAZ, Puerto Rico
</DL>
<LD>On a hot Caribbean night under a circus tent, seven furry polar
bears lumber into a caged-in arena and the glare of the spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   One by one, they take their places atop blue podiums around the ring
and wait for their trainer to offer bits of raw steak in exchange for a
trick.</LD>
<LD>   Their show is the featured attraction at the Suarez Brothers
Circus--and an outrage to animal welfare groups, which argue that
tropical Puerto Rico is no place for bears accustomed to subzero
temperatures.</LD>
<TE>   "I have seen a lot of animal abuse, but this is among the worst," said
lawyer Lori Kettler of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
In November, PETA sued two U.S. government agencies for allegedly failing
to enforce U.S. laws and confiscate the bears from the Mexican circus.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent nearly sold-out show in the 1,600-seat tent, the audience
had a mixed reaction best summed up by 7-year-old Sohemi Pagan Leon.</TE>
<TE>   "My favorite was the polar bears. I have never seen them before, but
they looked sad," said the second-grader from the southern town of Ponce.
"You could tell they didn't want to be there doing tricks."</TE>
<TE>   Nine times a week the bears perform the 10-minute act, towering on
hind legs and taking turns sliding down a ramp. They move stiffly and
pant heavily through the routine, directed by pokes and swats from the
trainer's wooden stick.</TE>
<TE>   In the audience sit giggling children and parents, who pay $8 to $15 a
ticket. Some watch the bears intently, while others focus on their sticks
of cotton candy or on ushers selling pina coladas.</TE>
<TE>   "A circus has to have a main animal attraction--lions, elephants. We
are the only circus that has polar bears," said Roberto Suarez, 62. He
and his two brothers, Raul and Jose, are the fourth generation to run the
130-year-old family circus from Guadalajara.</TE>
<TE>   According to PETA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture should have
confiscated the bears when it learned they were kept without air
conditioning and swimming pools, which U.S. law requires.</TE>
<TE>   The animal-rights group argues the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
shouldn't have issued the import permit allowing the circus to bring the
arctic bears from Canada. The agencies declined to comment while the case
is pending.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is so enraged. There have been so many opportunities to
correct this situation," said Debbie Leahy, PETA's captive animal
specialist.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Suarez said the circus has since bought air conditioners and a
swimming pool for the bears. Last month, a Puerto Rico District Court
judge acquitted a younger brother, circus owner Raul Suarez, of a
misdemeanor charge of animal cruelty.</TE>
<TE>   But Carla Cappalli, whose complaints on behalf of the Humane Society
of Puerto Rico led to the charge, promises to bring a new case against
the circus in federal court.</TE>
<TE>   She says she filmed a video--used in the Puerto Rican court as
evidence--showing the caged bears drooling and swaying in 113-degree
August heat without water.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, with the air a humid 80 degrees, the bears were
sprawled in cages, motionless but for the twitching of their ears against
flies.</TE>
<TE>   The Suarez brothers have applied for an export permit, which would
remove them from U.S. legal jurisdiction. Until it is issued, they say,
they will continue to tour Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   As polar bear exhibitors, they legally must offer education or
materials about the animals and their conservation. But the audience
didn't seem to notice that the man with the microphone gave no lecture
and the ushers passed out no educational pamphlets.</TE>
<TE>   "A circus isn't a circus without animals," said technician Maria
Tardaguila, 54, from Juana Diaz. "And the bears look OK. The man, I see,
he gives them pieces of meat."</TE>

<HD>Drought Conditions Grip a Third of U.S.</HD>
<DH>Climate: The warm winter and changes in atmospheric conditions
spell trouble for water supplies this summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF DONN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Drought has engulfed nearly a third of the United States,
threatening to confront some places this summer with what experts say
could be their worst water shortages in years.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a sleeping giant," says climatologist Mark Svoboda at the
National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Neb. "The impact is still
to come."</LD>
<LD>   Already, New York and Baltimore are pumping water from temporary
supplies normally avoided for their potentially less desirable color or
taste. Thousands of shallow wells in New Hampshire and Georgia have run
dry. In Kansas, some ranchers are hauling in water or selling off cattle.</LD>
<TE>   But a much stiffer test will come this summer when farmers water
crops, homeowners douse lawns and gardens, and high temperatures
evaporate more water faster. Without a rainy spring, some places in the
East may face a summer of water problems that rival record droughts of
the 1960s, according to Harry Lins at the U.S. Geological Survey.</TE>
<TE>   In typically dry Southern California, the recent feeble wet season is
apt to harden into full-blown drought, say government and private
forecasters. Bernie Rayno, a forecaster at the private AccuWeather
service in State College, Pa., is more worried about that region than the
East.</TE>
<TE>   "They're missing their window of opportunity," he says. "Once you get
past that, you're not going to get rain there."</TE>
<TE>   In the last six months, Los Angeles has seen just over a third of its
usual 11 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, drought has spread to about 30% of the country, according to
forecaster Richard Tinker at the Climate Prediction Center of the
National Weather Service. That is an unusually broad reach but still far
short of the 1930s Dust Bowl. In those years, up to 70% of the country
was parched, and dust clouds sometimes blotted out the sun for days at a
time.</TE>
<TE>   Drought conditions now run in two vast Eastern and Western strips,
each hundreds of miles across, from Maine to Georgia and Montana to
Texas, according to a federal-academic partnership that puts together the
U.S. Drought Monitor map.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters say it's especially difficult to make long-range forecasts
for the Northeast. But they are hopeful that the rains typical of spring
will relieve some of that region's drought conditions, which took hold
only last fall. Drought has lingered elsewhere, including Texas and
Georgia, for up to six years.</TE>
<TE>   There is no single accepted definition of drought. But one popular
standard defines it as 70% of normal rain or snow for three months
straight.</TE>
<TE>   Several factors have combined to parch so much territory, drought
experts say. La Nina, a cooling of Pacific Ocean surface waters, is
blamed for recent warm, dry winters in the Southeast and warm, dry
summers in the northern Rocky Mountain states.</TE>
<TE>   A northern track taken by high-altitude winds of the jet stream has
steered this winter's storms toward the Pacific Northwest and Midwest.
Persistent high pressure in the East has also locked out storms.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, one of the warmest winters on record in some places on the
East Coast is letting water soak into soft ground, instead of running off
to replenish surface supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Communities on the coast have issued drought watches and warnings.
Many have already appealed for voluntary cuts in water use.</TE>
<TE>   Some governments have taken their own steps. Connecticut environmental
officials said last week they were suspending the annual opening of dams
for the first time since 1981. The water release is meant to scour
riverbeds to improve fish habitats.</TE>
<TE>   With about half of the normal 23 inches of precipitation over the past
six months, New York City's reservoirs have sunk to 48% of capacity.
Water managers have doubled the share used from the New Croton
Reservoir--actually an older system--to 20%, though people sometimes
complain of its darker color and unpleasant smell. City officials say
mandatory reductions in water use could be imposed within a month.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating water management, a slight increase in two common
diarrhea-causing microorganisms, giardia and crytosporidium, has been
detected in the untreated water from the New Croton and Kensico
reservoirs, environmental officials say. Chlorinated water is deemed safe
for the general population, but doctors were warned Feb. 14 to advise New
York City-area residents with weak immune systems to boil water.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Sturcken, spokesman for the city Department of Environmental
Protection, says the higher readings may stem from more sensitive tests
in place since last fall. Another theory holds that lower water levels
from drought are boosting germ concentrations.</TE>
<TE>   Around Baltimore, reservoirs are lower than ever for this time of
year. The Prettyboy, one of three city reservoirs, has dropped to
one-third of capacity.</TE>

<HD>New York Alone in Answering Call for Safety</HD>
<DH>Law: While other states debate the issue, N.Y. drivers have gotten
2,000 tickets for cell phone use.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES HANNAH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DAYTON, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>Many states over the past year have considered banning the use of
hand-held cellular phones while driving, but so far only one--New
York--has taken that step.</LD>
<LD>   More than 2,000 tickets have been issued since the ban took effect
Nov. 1 and at least 20 states have begun tracking cell phone involvement
in traffic accidents, according to the National Conference of State
Legislatures.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, states may be reluctant to single out cell phones, which
businesspeople on the go consider essential, said conference spokesman
Bill Wyatt.</LD>
<TE>   "State legislatures are looking at it within the bigger picture,"
Wyatt said. "Are cell phones the only problem? How different is using a
cell phone while driving than putting on your makeup or tuning the
radio?"</TE>
<TE>   Last year, cell phone legislation was introduced in 43 states, 35 of
them calling for an outright ban on the use of hand-held cell phones
while driving.</TE>
<TE>   Some safety advocates believe the legislation has been stalled by
powerful cell phone lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Pena's 2-year-old daughter Morgan Lee Pena was killed in 1999
when a driver dialing a cell phone ran a stop sign and hit the car the
mother was driving in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   She said many lawmakers don't bother to research the issue themselves,
and the cell phone industry has convinced them that bans are unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   "They hire lobbyists to cover every state capital in the nation and
put on the pressure," said Pena, of Perkasie, Pa. "The telecommunications
lobby is huge, powerful and has lots and lots of money."</TE>
<TE>   Travis Larson, spokesman for the Washington-based Cellular
Telecommunications &amp; Internet Assn., said his group does not lobby at the
state level. However, he said the association supplies information to
cell phone companies that do.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the Cleveland suburb of Brooklyn became the first community
in the country to ban the use of hand-held cell phones by drivers.
Brooklyn fines drivers $35 for a first offense, with a possible $100 fine
for a second offense.</TE>
<TE>   Brooklyn Patrolman Rich Hovan, who wrote the first of what now totals
650 cell phone tickets in the city, jots the initials of Morgan Lee Pena
on tickets and gives each motorist a photo of the girl.</TE>
<TE>   "They always have an excuse about why they use the phone," Hovan said.
"I ask them, 'Would you accept that as an excuse if somebody killed your
daughter?' I haven't had anyone tell me 'Yeah.' "</TE>
<TE>   Brooklyn is among at least 14 communities nationwide that have
restricted the use of cell phones by drivers, according to the state
legislature conference. A statewide ban for Ohio was introduced in the
Legislature last year but is languishing in committee.</TE>
<TE>   A few states have adopted lesser restrictions. Arizona and
Massachusetts ban school bus drivers from using cell phones while
driving.</TE>
<TE>   Since Brooklyn imposed its ban, local freelance photographer Jamie
Janos said he has been using an earpiece with his cell phone, which he
relies on for assignments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely important to me because this is my way to
communicate," Janos said, adding that his business doubled when he began
using a cell phone. "Without it, I can't work effectively."</TE>
<TE>   He said the change has been an inconvenience, but he puts up with it
because of safety.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hurd, spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, said there are no reliable statistics on crashes
involving cell phones, but he estimated that 25% of crashes are related
to distractions.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a broad problem of driver distraction that includes cell
phone use, but is not restricted to cell phone use," said Stephanie Faul,
spokeswoman for the Washington-based AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.</TE>
<TE>   "People feed their babies. People write. People read. People eat. They
put on makeup. They comb their hair," Faul said. "Any legislation should
encompass the full range of distractions."</TE>

<HD>Blood Test Explored to Back Up Mammograms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURAN NEERGAARD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Scientists are testing blood from more than 1,000 women for a
protein that might signal breast cancer, hoping to create for women the
kind of blood test men have for prostate disease.</LD>
<LD>   It's too soon to know if the experiment will work. But the quest for
new ways to catch early tumors or even precancerous cells--from blood
testing to analyzing nipple fluid--is heating up amid controversy over
mammograms. Proponents foresee a day when the X-ray routinely comes with
a backup test.</LD>
<LD>   "Mammography is not the end-all," says Dr. Alan Hollingsworth of
Oklahoma City's Mercy Health Center, one of seven U.S. hospitals
participating in Matritech Inc.'s blood-test research.</LD>
<TE>   With a hint from another test that a tumor might be forming, "you
could look harder. There are ways to look harder than just with
mammography."</TE>
<TE>   Mammograms can detect tumors when they're tiny, often meaning the
difference between surgery that removes or spares the breast. Whether
they also save lives is under hot debate. The U.S. government thinks so,
and strongly urges women over age 40 to get one at least every other
year. Regardless, an estimated third of women don't get regular
mammograms.</TE>
<TE>   Other scientists argue that studies backing mammograms are too flawed
to determine if the procedure reduces death.</TE>
<TE>   Mammograms are certainly not perfect. They can miss tumors or flag
suspicious spots that turn out to be benign. More powerful imaging
techniques, like ultrasound or MRI, can better pinpoint tumors but are
too complex and expensive to use on everybody.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protein in men's blood
suggests they may have either an enlarged or cancerous prostate. So why
not a blood test for breast cancer?</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear matrix proteins, or NMPs, help form the skeleton of cell
nuclei as cells reproduce. Changes in nuclei size or shape can signal
cancer. The theory: Different cells use different NMPs, so changes in the
type or amount of a certain NMP in the blood could signal cell changes
that mean cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Matritech Inc., which licensed rights to NMP research from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, already sells a test that helps
diagnose bladder cancer by finding NMP-22 in urine.</TE>
<TE>   Now Matritech says a related protein, NMP-66, appears specific to
breast cancer. In a preliminary study of blood samples from 78 women,
NMP-66 was found in everyone with invasive cancer; four of five who had a
noninvasive tumor of the milk ducts; and no one with a normal mammogram.
The downside: It also was found in two of 24 women with benign breast
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Matritech is looking for NMP-66 in 700 women who will receive biopsies
to check for breast cancer, and another 400 women whose regular
mammograms show nothing suspicious. Results are expected later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Even if this first clinical trial of NMP-66 is promising, it will take
much more research to prove the test works, Hollingsworth cautioned.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are concerned about those false positives--positive tests
that turn out to be benign. It's not too hard to tell when a mammogram
causes a scare, but it will probably take longer to tell if a blood test
result is wrong, says Robert Smith of the American Cancer Society.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Matritech hopes to sell NMP-66 as a routine mammogram
backup.</TE>
<TE>   There is another breast test, called ductal lavage, that some women
are clamoring to get. Doctors put an anesthetic on the nipple and insert
a threadlike catheter to flush milk ducts with fluid that dislodges and
draws out cells.</TE>
<TE>   Ductal lavage is still experimental. It does not hunt for actual
tumors but it can detect abnormal cells that may signal precancerous
changes. It is recommended only for women at high risk of getting breast
cancer, to help them decide such things as how often to get mammograms or
whether to try the drug tamoxifen in hopes of preventing tumors.</TE>
<TE>   Until these experimental tests are better understood, the best advice
is to get a regular mammogram from a radiologist who does lots of
them--because more experience means more accuracy, says the cancer
society's Smith.</TE>

<HD>Old Economy Bedrock for New Recovery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The nation seems to be emerging from a new breed of high-speed
recession, one that's over almost before it's begun. Most of the credit
is going to the very same trends that helped fuel the 1990s boom--the
high-tech investments intended to reshape the country into a lean, mean
New Economy.</LD>
<LD>   But don't tell that to Tony Raimondo, whose Columbus, Neb., metal
fabrication business "fell off the shelf" 18 months ago and shows no sign
of recovering despite substantial investments. Or to Peter Dalinis, a
27-year-old Seattle Web developer who may have to move in with his
parents for lack of work. "It's embarrassing, but I can't find anything,"
he said.</LD>
<LD>   The nation is patching itself up from the triple whammy of a
technology stock bust, corporate investment contraction and the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. And it's doing so more rapidly than most expected.</LD>
<TE>   But the improvements are not coming at the headlong pace some
economists claimed last week. And, according to a variety of analysts,
the chief cause is not New Economy advances but a distinctly Old Economy
trend: ordinary Americans, buoyed in large part by rising home prices and
strong employment, continuing to buy.</TE>
<TE>   "The two most striking qualities of this recession are its mildness
and the fact that consumers have held up so well," said Harvard economist
Jeffrey Frankel, a member of the six-person panel that declares when
recessions begin and end. Frankel cautioned that he was speaking only for
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that housing wealth kept rising through the recession and
that people could take advantage of it through mortgage refinancing and
home equity loans kept them buying," said Karl E. Case, a Wellesley
College economist and an expert on real estate markets.</TE>
<TE>   What's behind the nascent--and unexpectedly quick--recovery could help
determine whether the country can resume the sharply upward arc of the
late 1990s and quickly help people like Raimondo and Dalinis.</TE>
<TE>   It also is of substantial political importance. Treasury Secretary
Paul H. O'Neill already has claimed that credit is due President Bush's
10-year, $1.3-trillion tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has argued that recent
improvements are a triumph of the central bank's aggressive interest rate
cuts and the kind of deregulated, technology-driven market economy he
endorses.</TE>
<TE>   New Economy advocates have gone still further and asserted that the
improvements vindicate the notion that the country is undergoing a
fundamental change to a wired, agile, entrepreneurial state.</TE>
<TE>   "This proves there is a New Economy. It proves we're able to react
more rapidly and effectively to change," declared Joel L. Naroff, a
Holland, Pa., economic consultant. "We do everything more quickly--even
recessions."</TE>
<TE>   One problem with New Economy claims, according to analysts, is that,
if true, they could paradoxically make it harder for the country to snap
back from recession.</TE>
<TE>   For example, statistics released last week showed continued surprising
improvement in productivity, the economy's ability to make more goods and
services for every hour of work. While the trend means business is more
efficient--a key aim of New Economy theorists and companies' high-tech
investments--it also means firms can boost production without adding
workers.</TE>
<TE>   The result: The economy may grow even faster than it has been without
reducing unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   A second problem is that the grandest of the New Economy claims simply
don't square with recent developments. That seems especially true in the
nation's manufacturing sector, where high-tech inventory systems and
global competition have worked immense changes, yet goods-makers have
suffered more than almost anyone else in the current downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Plagued by a strong dollar and overcapacity, the sector has been in
depression for more than a year, with output falling and layoffs of more
than 1.6 million workers. Statistics last week suggesting the worst may
be over haven't translated into new business for Raimondo and many of his
colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see a recovery," said the chairman and chief executive of
Behlen Manufacturing Co., which makes everything from metal buildings and
grain silos to dog kennels. The firm has lost more than one-fourth of its
business and has laid off 400 of its 1,600 employees.</TE>
<TE>   "We're struggling month to month," said Don Wainwright, chairman and
chief executive of St. Louis-based metal fabricator Wainwright Industries
Inc. and chairman of the National Assn. of Manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just a paralysis out there. Nobody wants to take a chance."</TE>
<TE>   That paralysis has carried over to corporate America generally, where
tumbling profits and stumbling stock prices have produced a sharp
contraction in business investment and a string of spectacular
bankruptcies that includes Enron, retail giant Kmart and
telecommunications operator Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   But there--to almost everyone's surprise--the trouble has stopped, and
a firewall seems to have arisen between the economy's corporate and
consumer sectors.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is pretty weak, but consumers have stayed strong," said
Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Robert M. Solow, a Nobel
Prize winner. "They're not worried about debt. They're not scared of
unemployment. There's not any panic. It's a puzzlement."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts have come up with an answer to the puzzle: that the
layoffs and stock market losses that analysts feared would wreak havoc on
the economy have taken their tolls on unexpectedly narrow groups or
regions, leaving the rest of the country to go about its business.</TE>
<TE>   Although the recession was widely reported to have touched virtually
all industries and parts of the country, government statistics show that
layoffs fell predominantly on young workers, temporary employees and
certain regions.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the employment shrinkage over the last year was
among 16- to 24-year-olds, who either were laid off or did not enter the
labor force in the numbers they had during the boom years, according to
U.S. Census Bureau figures.</TE>
<TE>   Although temporary workers make up only 2% of the work force, they
accounted for more than one-third of the job losses between February 2001
and last month, Labor Department figures show.</TE>
<TE>   As for regional concentration, the West Coast--hit hard by the
technology and telecommunications collapses and setbacks in commercial
aerospace--has been the big loser. Washington reported the highest
unemployment rate in the nation, at 8% in January, the latest month for
which figures are available. Oregon and California were close behind at
7.5% and 6.2%, respectively, both well above the national average of
5.6%. In February, the nation's unemployment rate stood at 5.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Dalinis, the Seattle computer programmer, knows about the
concentration of layoffs, having been a temporary worker and from a state
with high unemployment. He says that when he arrived from Chicago four
years ago, he would get 30 calls a day from potential employers. Now, he
gets none.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be one of those millionaires by the time I was 25," he
said ruefully of his move West. As he collects the last of his
unemployment checks, he said he is considering a career change--to
cooking. That, or sell his car and move back to Chicago and in with his
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "We've really concentrated the job losses and let the rest of the
nation kick back," said Paul E. Harrington, associate director of the
Center for Labor Market Studies at Boston's Northeastern University.</TE>
<TE>   During the late 1990s, the richest 20% of Americans owned the lion's
share of stock, enjoyed an outsize portion of the paper profits, and were
responsible for a disproportionate amount of consumer spending, Greenspan
said. But the same households bore the brunt of the market's fall since
March 2000, and reacted by curbing spending, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinarily, a sharp drop-off in spending would have been disastrous,
setting off a vicious cycle of production cuts, layoffs and plummeting
demand. But no such drop occurred because the bottom four-fifths of
Americans--those with moderate incomes--kept on buying.</TE>
<TE>   "Moderate-income households have a much larger proportion of their
assets in homes, and the continuing rise in the value of houses has
provided greater support for their net worth," Greenspan said.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing high-tech or New Economy about that. In the end, it is
ordinary Americans buying routine goods and services who have salvaged
the economy from the damage of the dot-com bust and telecom collapse.</TE>

<SE>A CHANGED AMERICA. ABOUT THIS SERIES: This is the 10th report in an
occasional series exploring the effects of Sept. 11 on various aspects of
American society.

<LD>American civil liberties are as fixed and steady an influence in
national life as the stock market--and every bit as elastic.</LD>
<LD>   Like the market, the rights enjoyed by U.S. citizens have grown to an
extent that the Founding Fathers probably never imagined. But in times of
danger, civil liberties have shrunk, suffering what market analysts might
call a correction.</LD>
<LD>   Since Sept. 11, the federal government has approved secret military
tribunals for accused terrorists, given law enforcement unprecedented
powers to tap phones and read e-mail, and helped foster an atmosphere of
self-censorship summed up shortly after the attacks by White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer, who warned Americans to "watch what they say."</LD>
<TE>   None of this compares to the internment of Japanese Americans during
World War II or the widespread suspension of liberties during and after
World War I. But after decades of steady advances in civil liberties, the
government's actions seem to mark a historical shift.</TE>
<TE>   The weight of change has fallen most heavily on foreigners,
particularly Middle Easterners. The shift is all the more striking
because before September noncitizens had been enjoying their greatest
period of freedom in U.S. history, the result of a series of U.S. Supreme
Court rulings.</TE>
<TE>   In one of those decisions, Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote last summer
that once immigrants enter the United States, they are protected by the
Constitution "whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary
or permanent."</TE>
<TE>   The spirit and letter of government policy changed drastically after
the terrorist attacks. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft ordered the detention of
more than 1,000 foreigners suspected of posing a security threat or
believed to have information about the hijackers. Information about the
detainees has been scanty. Many have had little or no access to lawyers
and family.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Justice Department, 327 people remain in detention
for immigration violations, such as overstaying a visa. One hundred and
fourteen are behind bars on criminal charges, mostly minor and none
directly related to the terrorist attacks. An undisclosed number are
being held as material witnesses, meaning the government suspects they
know something about the hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   Human Rights Watch, an international rights organization, complained
last month that the U.S. "continues to refuse to disclose basic
information" about the imprisoned foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   The change is palpable in such places as Brookhurst Street in Anaheim,
a neighborhood of immigrants from Egypt, Syria, Jordan and other Middle
Eastern nations. A new vocabulary has taken root in places where people
gather to talk amid curling smoke trails from water pipes. Conversations
are peppered with references to interrogations, searches, detentions and
hate crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Stephen Mashney works here in a third-floor office
overlooking Arab shops and restaurants. "There is a very severe chill
among Arabs and Muslims who are Arab," said the Palestinian immigrant.
"The U.S. that exists today is not the same place that existed before
Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>'It's Beautiful for Americans Only'</TE>
<TE>   Omar Mohamed spent six months in the United States, a time that seemed
divided between two countries.</TE>
<TE>   For the first three months, the 19-year-old Egyptian explored the
America of his dreams: the Empire State Building, the casinos of Atlantic
City, N.J., even the "dollar menu" at McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   "It was beautiful," Mohamed said in accented but proper English.</TE>
<TE>   The next three months he spent behind bars at the Hudson County Jail
in Kearny, N.J. By the time he was deported Dec. 14, he had come to a new
understanding of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beautiful," he said, "for Americans only."</TE>
<TE>   The government will not say why Mohamed was detained for so long.
Investigators found no evidence that he was involved in terrorism. He was
charged with violating the provisions of his tourist visa by working.</TE>
<TE>   In a jailhouse interview hours before he was deported, Mohamed
described himself as a third-year mechanical engineering student at Ain
Shams University in Cairo. He had come to the United States on a
round-trip ticket given to him by his parents, both of whom work for
EgyptAir. The trip was intended, he said, as a break in his studies, an
opportunity to see the world. He was invited to stay with a family friend
who owns a gas station in Toms River, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Mohamed began pumping gas there. After Sept. 11, the FBI got a tip
that one of the 19 hijackers had worked at the station. Agents
investigated and quickly determined that the tip was erroneous. They
nevertheless detained one attendant, who was later released.</TE>
<TE>   Mohamed was also picked up--perhaps, he said, because he had told
American friends he wanted to take flight lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true," he said. "My father works for the airline, my mother
works for the airline. I thought they could help me get a job."</TE>
<TE>   After he was arrested Sept. 18, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service gave him two options, Mohamed said. He could agree to deportation
or fight to stay in the United States. He chose deportation but was then
told he needed FBI clearance to leave.</TE>
<TE>   It was a frustrating case, said his lawyer, Sohail Mohammed of
Clifton, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how to keep someone in the country," he said. "But trying to
get someone out is a lot more difficult than I thought it would be."</TE>
<TE>   Mohamed said he wasn't allowed to call his family in Egypt. He
estimated that he was among 200 Middle Eastern men at the jail. He said
the rooms were cold, the food violated Muslim dietary laws and he was
taunted by American prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "They tell me, 'Osama will help you,' " Mohamed said, smiling wryly.
"They say, 'You're Arab. Why don't you just make a hole in the wall with
a bomb?' "</TE>
<TE>   He said he was angry.</TE>
<TE>   "People have a right to be told why they are being held," he said. "We
know we were wrong for violating our visas, but why do they hold us for
this long?"</TE>
<TE>   For lawyer Mohammed, Sept. 11 sparked a boom in business. After the
attacks, he took on about a dozen detainees as clients and became a
spokesman for their plight. He also saw a sharp increase in the number of
Middle Eastern immigrants who want to apply for citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, he said, "they would say, 'What's the difference? I
have all the rights a citizen has.' "</TE>
<TE>   They no longer say that.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a clear line in the sand being drawn now," he said, "and
which side of the sand you're on makes a big difference."</TE>
<TE>   There is no such thing as absolute civil liberty. "It is not simply
'liberty,' " observed Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in his 1998
book, "All the Laws but One." The qualifier "civil" comes from the same
root as the word "citizen" and implies obligations as well as freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   A modern American has the liberty to hop in a sport-utility vehicle
(as long as it's registered) with personalized (but not obscene) license
plates and go wherever he or she wants--assuming he or she doesn't exceed
the speed limit, which is one of the "civil" parts of that liberty. The
limit changes from time to time and place to place.</TE>
<TE>   In the same way, other liberties have ebbed and flowed throughout the
nation's history.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian, said it is a relatively
recent phenomenon for civil liberties to be considered "very ingrained in
our culture. For most of our history, the Bill of Rights was pretty
irrelevant. There were egregious violations well into the 20th century."</TE>
<TE>   Foner, author of "The Story of American Freedom," a history of civil
liberties, said the idea of those freedoms as a central national ethos
did not gain broad currency until the 1920s, in reaction to governmental
excesses during and after World War I.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, the government effectively banned dissent, and federal
agents led by a young J. Edgar Hoover rounded up hundreds of suspected
communists and anarchists, held them without trial and ultimately
deported them.</TE>
<TE>   World War II witnessed the detention of 110,000 people of Japanese
descent, two-thirds of them U.S. citizens. The detainees, most of whom
were from California, lost homes and businesses; many also lost faith in
the American values of equality and fair play. It would be nearly 50
years before the government formally apologized and paid reparations.</TE>
<TE>   The war era also yielded the Smith Act, which made it a crime to
advocate the violent overthrow of the government or to belong to a group
that espoused revolution. The act provided the underpinnings for the
McCarthy-era repression of communists and their purported allies.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, a legal controversy sparked by Nazi repression
contributed to the enshrinement of civil liberties as a core American
value.</TE>
<TE>   In 1933, German officials banned the Jehovah's Witnesses for refusing
to join in the "Heil Hitler" raised-palm salute. Thousands of Witnesses
were imprisoned in German concentration camps.</TE>
<TE>Wartime Case Proved to Be Watershed</TE>
<TE>   In response, Jehovah's Witnesses in the United States denounced
compulsory flag salute laws everywhere. When Witness schoolchildren in
Minersville, Pa., refused to salute, they were expelled for
insubordination. The expulsions were upheld by the Supreme Court, 8 to 1,
in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   Writing for the majority, Justice Felix Frankfurter extolled the flag
as "the symbol of our national unity, transcending all internal
differences."</TE>
<TE>   The issue was before the high court again in 1943. With two new
justices and three who had changed their minds since 1940, the court
reversed its earlier ruling.</TE>
<TE>   In the majority opinion, Justice Robert H. Jackson linked the issue to
the nation's battle against fascism. In quashing unpopular liberties, he
suggested, the U.S. was stooping to the level of its enemy.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who begin coercive elimination of dissent soon find themselves
exterminating dissenters," he wrote. "Compulsory unification of opinion
achieves only the unanimity of the graveyard."</TE>
<TE>   Civil liberties were considerably broadened during Earl Warren's term
as U.S. chief justice from 1953 to 1969, starting with the landmark Brown
vs. Board of Education decision of 1954, which outlawed segregated
schools.</TE>
<TE>   The Warren Court also restricted wiretapping, upheld the right to be
secure against unreasonable searches and seizures, broadened the
parameters of free speech and strengthened the right to counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the case names are part of the American lexicon--prime among
them "Miranda," the 1966 ruling requiring police to inform a suspect that
anything he says can be used against him and that he can confer with a
lawyer before being required to answer any questions.</TE>
<TE>   Like previous crises, Sept. 11 sparked a curtailment of liberties in
the name of national security.</TE>
<TE>   The USA Patriot Act, signed into law by President Bush on Oct. 26,
broadened the government's power to monitor private conversations and
e-mail, allowed police to obtain a search warrant and enter someone's
home without his knowledge, and made it easier to deport noncitizens
suspected of activity that endangers national security.</TE>
<TE>   A separate change in immigration rules permits the attorney general to
keep foreigners in detention even when an immigration judge has ordered
them freed.</TE>
<TE>   Many argue that the Patriot Act and the detentions of noncitizens are
reasonable under the circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures," said Rep.
Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), a strong advocate of civil liberties who
nonetheless voted for the Patriot Act. "There will be a time when it's no
longer extraordinary and we go back to more ordinary times."</TE>
<TE>   Aspects of the administration's policies have come under vigorous
attack, however. In particular, many liberals and civil libertarians have
expressed horror at Bush's order permitting suspected foreign terrorists
to be tried by military tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   Such tribunals typically afford defendants fewer rights than a regular
criminal court. They may be held in secret. A panel of military judges
can decide guilt or innocence, and even impose the death penalty, by a
less-than-unanimous vote. Defendants may not appeal to a higher court;
only the president or the secretary of Defense may overturn a verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Philip B. Heymann, a Harvard University law professor and former
deputy U.S. attorney general, strongly supports most of what the Bush
administration has done. But when it comes to the military tribunals, he
said, "I think they have gone absolutely crazy."</TE>
<TE>   The order shows that Bush "deeply misunderstands what the U.S. is
about," Heymann said. "The idea that the president could say . . . 'You
are involved in terrorism and therefore you can be tried by three or five
colonels of my choice whose promotion depends on how they behave at
trial--a private trial with no judicial review' . . . absolutely staggers
me."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the idea has popular support. Roughly two-thirds of the
respondents in two national polls late last year said such tribunals
should be used.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that's a justified tool," said Andrew Powell, a commercial
leasing agent in Ankeny, Iowa. "The people in the [World Trade Center]
didn't have a right to appeal when the buildings were coming down. I feel
the tribunals are very justified."</TE>
<TE>Free Speech Gives Way to Self-Censorship</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps just as important as the changes in law are the more subtle
changes in American culture. No new law dictates what people can or can't
say. But there has been a narrowing of the parameters of what society
deems acceptable, and many people find themselves exercising
self-censorship.</TE>
<TE>   Some American Muslims have become fearful of speaking out for
unpopular causes, said Salam Al-Marayati, national director of the Muslim
Public Affairs Council, based in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The message basically is, you cannot talk about certain issues," he
said. "You cannot talk about foreign policy, you cannot talk about the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict. That if that were to be brought up, we
would immediately be branded as being on the other side. . . . And our
concern is that we're going to lose the America that we're trying to
protect."</TE>
<TE>   Abdo Khouraki owns the Sindbad Ranch grocery, which sells Middle
Eastern food on Brookhurst Street in Anaheim. A naturalized American
citizen, he came to the United States 27 years ago and is grateful for
this country's freedoms. But the climate since Sept. 11 has begun to
remind him of his native Syria.</TE>
<TE>   "In Syria," he said, "when you talk politics, you make sure you know
everybody in the room, and you whisper."</TE>
<TE>   Not only Middle Easterners have felt the chill.</TE>
<TE>   "Do us all a favor and die," read an e-mail sent recently to Steve
Benson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist for the Arizona
Republic in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of dozens of abusive, threatening or obscene messages
Benson received after drawing cartoons critical of the U.S. military
campaign in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "You should have been in the towers on 9/11," said another.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing new about a political cartoonist receiving hate mail.
But Benson said that what he has gotten since Sept. 11 has been
exceptional in volume and venom. The anger swelled as the thrust of his
cartoons shifted from sympathy for the victims of the terrorist attacks
to outrage at U.S. policy.</TE>
<TE>   The foment peaked after a Nov. 8 cartoon titled "Dumb Bombs." It
featured a grinning Bush flying a military jet, dropping bombs labeled
"Killing Innocent Civilians" and "Starving Millions of Afghans."</TE>
<TE>   So great was the outcry that two newspapers, the St. George Spectrum
in Utah and the Greeley Tribune in Colorado, apologized to readers for
running the cartoon, which was made available to them through the United
Feature Syndicate.</TE>
<TE>   Benson, an auxiliary police officer and iconoclast whose views resist
categorization, said he has been "appalled by what I see as the
intolerance of many Americans for allowing views that digress from their
own. I think if we put up the 1st Amendment and some of the other basic
freedoms to a vote, they'd go down in flames."</TE>
<TE>   Benson said his own newspaper has been very supportive. That has not
been a universal experience.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Guthrie said he realized in advance that his Sept. 15 column for
the Daily Courier of Grants Pass, Ore., would stir up readers. "I knew
the timing was terrible," he said. But he didn't expect it to cost him
his job.</TE>
<TE>   In the column, he accused Bush of cowardice for shuttling to two Air
Force bases instead of returning immediately to the White House after the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "His first time under real pressure, he bolted," Guthrie wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Guthrie was pilloried by readers. Eventually, the editor of the
Courier published an apology. A week after the column appeared, Guthrie,
61, was fired. He said he was told it was because of the way in which he
responded to critical e-mails, not because of the column itself. The
Courier's publisher has declined to comment. But Guthrie said he is
convinced he lost his job for expressing an unpopular view.</TE>
<TE>   The changed mood was also evident at a California State University
commencement ceremony in Sacramento on Dec. 15. The speaker, publisher
Janis Besler Heaphy of the Sacramento Bee, expressed concern that the war
on terrorism was undermining basic American freedoms. She was booed off
the stage before she could finish.</TE>
<TE>   The willingness to put security ahead of long-cherished protections
reflects in part the shock of seeing terrorists kill thousands of
Americans on U.S. soil.</TE>
<TE>   Akhil Reed Amar, a professor at Yale Law School and author of a book
on the Bill of Rights, believes that of all the factors contributing to
American civil liberties, the most important has been the country's
"unique geostrategic location."</TE>
<TE>   "Once we succeeded in throwing off the British yoke," he said,
"Americans were able to become hegemonic in their own continent without a
lot of military enemies surrounding them."</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11, Amar said, demonstrated that the world is much smaller than
it used to be.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," he said, "we are vulnerable in ways the rest of the world
always has been vulnerable."</TE>

<TE>Limiting Civil Liberties</TE>
<TE>    Americans tend to think of civil liberties as fixed and
immutable. In fact, they have expanded and contracted throughout the
nation's history. Those freedoms have often been compromised during
times of crisis and war.</TE>
<TE>   1798: Congress passes the Alien and Sedition Acts in anticipation
of war with France, restricting the rights of pro-French immigrants
and the press.</TE>
<TE>   1861: At the outset of the Civil War, President Lincoln suspends
habeas corpus, allowing draft-resisters and Confederate sympathizers
to be jailed indefinitely without charges.</TE>
<TE>   1917: Congress passes the Espionage Act, which allows the
government to prosecute almost any critic of World War I on charges
of disloyalty. Post office refuses to distribute a popular leftist
magazine, The Masses. A federal appeals court says the magazine does
not speak with the voice of patriotism and therefore does not deserve
to be distributed.</TE>
<TE>   1918: The Espionage Act is tightened and becomes the Sedition Act.
Socialist leader and four-time presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs
is convicted of sedition and stripped of his U.S. citizenship for
speaking out against the act. He remains in jail through the 1920
presidential election, in which he is also a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 2, 1920: Government agents in 33 cities round up thousands of
foreigners suspected of being anarchists or communists, and hold many
of them without charges for long periods. The sweep becomes known as
the Palmer Raids, after Atty. Gen. J. Mitchell Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   1940: Congress passes the Smith Act, formally known as the Alien
Registration Act, which makes it a crime to advocate the overthrow of
the U.S. government or to belong to any group that does so. After
World War II, this law is used to prosecute suspected communists.</TE>
<TE>   March 1942: The government establishes 10 relocation centers for
110,000 people of Japanese descent--U.S. citizens and Japanese
nationals--and interns them for the duration of World War II.
Congress offers a formal apology and compensation to the internees 46
years later, in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   1956-71: FBI conducts counterintelligence operations against
domestic dissidents under a campaign called COINTELPRO. Tactics
include disinformation, infiltration and disruption of the activities
of targeted groups, which are mostly on the political left. In 1974,
the Justice Department says some of the operations could only be
considered abhorrent in a free society.</TE>
<TE>   October 2001: Congress passes the USA Patriot Act, which creates a
crime of domestic terrorism, authorizes "sneak and peek" searches
conducted without the target's knowledge, broadens the government's
power to monitor phone and Internet communications, and lets the
attorney general detain any foreigner believed to threaten national
security.</TE>

<HD>Gains and Gaps in Sept. 11 Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: U.S. officials say they've foiled many attacks. But Al
Qaeda's 'middle managers' are still at large.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Six months after the Sept. 11 skyjackings, the Justice Department
is planning to send specially trained federal counterterrorism
prosecutors to Europe to help press charges against the dozens of
suspects taken into custody in recent months.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said they hope to reinvigorate law enforcement and
intelligence gathering efforts that have achieved major success on some
fronts--most notably by preventing numerous attacks against U.S.
embassies and other facilities abroad--but also remain frighteningly
incomplete.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators have failed, for example, to apprehend the "middle
management" terrorists who provided money, false identification documents
and other support to the 19 hijackers from hide-outs in Germany,
Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   Until they and their associates are identified and captured, U.S.
officials warn, other deadly attacks are almost certain to occur. And
what's worse, they fear that Al Qaeda's increasing reliance on
independent terrorist operatives--as opposed to more traditional "cells"
that can be monitored by Western intelligence--has made detection more
difficult than ever.</TE>
<TE>   The gaps in the case are huge. Despite the largest investigation in
U.S. history, officials still cannot determine whether anyone assisted or
supervised the 19 hijackers after they arrived in the United States. In
interviews, U.S. law enforcement authorities confirmed that they are
still pursuing such evidence, citing Al Qaeda's history of having a
senior member on scene just before an attack.</TE>
<TE>   And although U.S. officials have rattled the public with repeated
warnings about possible follow-up attacks since September, they have yet
to determine who might lead such an attack or where and when it might
occur.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. law enforcement officials say they are searching for dozens of
people around the world who may be tied to the 19 skyjackers who aimed
three jetliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and crashed
another in a Pennsylvania field. But they admit the case might never be
fully solved.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we never will have a complete picture of everybody who
participated in any way," said Assistant Atty. Gen. Michael Chertoff, who
heads the investigation for the U.S. Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think we're now beginning to see . . . links between people who
were involved in Sept. 11 and people who have been involved in other
[terrorist] groups overseas and other attempts overseas."</TE>
<TE>   Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, which forged many of those links,
has been hurt by the loss of its sanctuary in Afghanistan, by thousands
of arrests and interrogations, by increased electronic and other
high-tech surveillance, and by the freezing of assets of allegedly allied
individuals and groups. But the danger clearly remains.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who is out there who is part of this, that we don't have in
custody or who isn't dead, is a threat," Chertoff said.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, he said whoever helped suspected lead skyjacker Mohamed
Atta during his still-unexplained visits to Spain before the attacks
"presumably is available to help somebody else do something." Another
unsolved mystery: why Atta and another hijacker traveled to Portland,
Maine, to board a connecting flight to the jet they used in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "They were very savvy in how they set it up," former FBI associate
deputy director Oliver "Buck" Revell said of the hijackers and their
co-conspirators. "They made it very difficult to track and trace even
after the fact." While the Pentagon and CIA have focused on capturing or
killing Bin Laden and his top commanders, the FBI and other criminal
investigators have concentrated on those who acted as go-betweens with
Atta and the other skyjackers, as well as other terrorist cells.</TE>
<TE>   "The critical thing is the middle management," Chertoff said. "Based
on [Al Qaeda] history, there is some level of approval at the top, but
also some degree of delegation" to people who helped with planning and
operational details.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those suspected terrorists may never be caught or prosecuted,
he added. Others may be recruited as informants in the effort to prevent
attacks. And some may simply be charged with other crimes to take them
out of circulation.</TE>
<TE>   "In some cases, you don't have sufficient evidence to hold them for a
real long time, but you can make their life miserable for a while, which
is worth doing," said one official.</TE>
<TE>   The initial FBI-led dragnet for those responsible for Sept. 11 has
expanded into a far more international undertaking. Administration
officials have engaged in high-level efforts to coordinate overseas law
enforcement, intelligence and financial agencies. Special
counterterrorism prosecutors will be deployed to Europe, for example, to
support efforts by local authorities to prosecute suspects in custody and
to track down those still at large.</TE>
<TE>   "This has become truly a global investigation, and we realize we need
to put people closer to where the action is, and to establish better
relations with other nations," a Justice Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill traveled through the Middle East
last week, for example, meeting leaders of four nations to shore up
attempts to identify and seize terrorists' assets. So far, officials
said, more than $100 million in assets has been frozen, although it's
unclear what impact--if any--that has had.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said the financial crackdown has significantly hampered Al
Qaeda's ability to move money and troops. But one senior federal law
enforcement official questioned its value, saying Al Qaeda moves most of
its money through untraceable cash, diamonds and gold.</TE>
<TE>   At home, federal authorities are girding for the long haul. The
Justice Department has asked Congress to give authorities at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, expanded power to take DNA samples from the more than 300 war
detainees there and include the information in a national DNA database
for use in investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are changing their names, they're changing their
appearances. DNA is the only thing they can't change," said Justice
Department spokeswoman Barbara Comstock.</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic signs of the investigation's progress have been
overseas. Since last fall, Washington and its allies have detected and
disrupted potential attacks against U.S. facilities and interests in,
among other countries, Bosnia-Herzegovina, France, Italy, Jordan,
Macedonia, Singapore, Turkey and Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   The plots had few common links beyond the obvious: to kill large
numbers of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "Some have ties to Al Qaeda, or have people who have been through the
Afghan [terrorist training] camps, or have received financial support
from Al Qaeda," said a U.S. intelligence official. "But you can't show a
single hand on every thwarted plot."</TE>
<TE>   The largest known plot was in Singapore. Officials there say members
of an Al Qaeda affiliate planned to simultaneously detonate seven truck
bombs against U.S. and Western embassies as well as U.S. warships, planes
and companies. Suspects have been arrested in Singapore, Malaysia,
Indonesia and the Philippines, but several key figures in the regional Al
Qaeda network remain at large.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the investigations have produced arrests in more than 60
countries, not including Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
about 500 people have been arrested in the Middle East and Pakistan, 250
in Europe, 150 in Asia, 75 in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union,
50 in Latin America and 50 in Africa. The official said about half of
those arrested remain in custody.</TE>
<TE>   "Their significance varies, but it's mostly regional," the official
said. "That is, they're mostly important in the countries where they were
rolled up."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have also seized hundreds of thousands of financial,
communication and travel records. They even have tracked terrorists
through cyberspace, as increasingly sophisticated operatives and their
supporters sign on from Internet cafes and libraries to communicate.</TE>
<TE>   Despite those efforts, FBI Director Robert Mueller cautioned that it
may take decades to finally solve Sept. 11. In a recent briefing with
reporters, he likened the case to that of Pan Am Flight 103, which
exploded in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.</TE>
<TE>   Now, 14 years later, "without a question or doubt, there are others
who played a role in Pan Am 103 that have still to be identified," said
Mueller, who headed that probe as chief of the Justice Department's
criminal division--Chertoff's current job.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 investigation has proved far more difficult, in part
because Al Qaeda, which means "the Base" in Arabic, has used new
techniques to evade scrutiny and surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   For years, authorities believed Al Qaeda was a loose network of cells
and affiliated groups around the world. Each had a hierarchy, and most
had at least some members trained at paramilitary camps in Afghanistan.
The cells enjoyed wide autonomy but maintained clear ties to Bin Laden's
"command and control" structure in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But since September, authorities have found a previously unknown
substructure of "sleeper" jihadists who operate as independents. As such,
they avoid formal cell structures--and the surveillance those structures
attract.</TE>
<TE>   These rootless militants hold no allegiance or tie to any one group,
said an FBI official who has spent years investigating Al Qaeda. They may
link up with others to plan an attack on a U.S. embassy or military
facility, but then quickly disband.</TE>
<TE>   "These are people who share the same ideologies, but who will
formalize [their relationship] for just one event and move on," said the
FBI official, who described them as "affinity groups" of terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The alliances "are always shifting, which makes it impossible to
investigate" them, said the FBI official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity. He said their ranks have grown as zealots have returned from
Afghanistan to communities where extremist groups are under close
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, terrorist experts point to Zacarias Moussaoui, the only
person indicted in the United States for his alleged participation in the
Sept. 11 plot.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have found no evidence showing Moussaoui was in direct
contact with any of the 19 skyjackers.</TE>
<TE>   They also cite Richard Reid, the so-called shoe bomb suspect. An
apparently rootless Briton, Reid was arrested Dec. 22 after being subdued
aboard a transatlantic flight while allegedly trying to light powerful
explosives hidden in his sneakers.</TE>
<TE>   Senior officials say they believe Al Qaeda changed tactics after law
enforcement and intelligence efforts determined traditional cells bombed
two U.S. embassies in Africa in August 1998 and a U.S. warship in Yemen
in October 2000, killing 241 people altogether.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the Sept. 11 skyjackers "broke up into [groups] of one,
two or three, they operated in various communities around the country and
the word cell, I think, does not accurately describe their activity,"
Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the hijackers "came into the country with a specific
objective in sight and showed substantial discipline in not contacting Al
Qaeda supporters or sympathizers who might have been known to us,"
Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time we adopt or adapt some new ploy" to identify and root out
terrorists, Mueller added, Al Qaeda attempts "to adopt a procedure to
circumvent what we have done."</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft also voiced concerns about the morphing of Al
Qaeda. Sept. 11, he said, was a "fragmented attack," conceived in
Afghanistan, planned in Germany and perhaps Southeast Asia and carried
out in the United States. That strategy, he said, shortens the "interval
for detection" of the hijackers' activities in any one place.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials say they believe most of the 19
skyjackers--including 15 from Saudi Arabia--flew alone to America and
avoided any kind of terrorist support network here.</TE>
<TE>   "There's certainly no strong evidence" of others being involved in the
United States, said one federal law enforcement official who asked not to
be identified.</TE>
<TE>   But Chertoff said U.S.-based collaborators have not been ruled out. In
several past plots, he noted, a senior Al Qaeda operative was sent to
supervise planning but then flew out several days before the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no doubt that there were senior leaders who were involved to
some degree or another in planning this," Chertoff said. "They may have
used the same MO they've used in the past, or they may have changed it.
But obviously those are people we are interested in finding . . . whether
or not they were actually on the scene."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities have questioned or detained thousands of people since
Sept. 11, and at least 300 remain in custody. None has been charged with
terrorism. About 10 others are being held under sealed indictments, but
officials say none has been tied to the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Still, intriguing leads remain.</TE>
<TE>   In Virginia, Mohamed Abdi, a Somalia-born U.S. citizen whose name and
telephone number were scrawled on a map found in the abandoned car of one
hijacker, ultimately pleaded guilty to unrelated charges. His lawyer said
Abdi has no connection to the hijackers, but authorities say they are
skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   In Jacksonville, Fla., the FBI is continuing to check several people
who may have met Atta and another suspected hijacker, Ziad Samir Jarrah,
at area hotels and strip clubs that Atta frequented, according to an
internal FBI memorandum.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by a grand jury that has issued more than 115 subpoenas, FBI
agents in the Jacksonville area recently checked hotel records, phone
logs, flight school data and other records that might shed light on the
hijackers' contacts.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also administered lie-detector tests to several people
who are suspected of knowing more about Al Qaeda than they have revealed,
the memo says. But no conclusive links to Al Qaeda or the hijackings
appear to have been established.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden, who U.S. authorities say is chiefly responsible for Sept.
11, has disappeared, as have his top commanders. Whether Al Qaeda will
survive if he is captured or killed remains a matter of sharp debate.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden "isn't the problem," Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
told reporters recently.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that there are global terrorist networks in this world
beyond Al Qaeda. If he were dead today, there are 10, 15 other people who
could run that network."</TE>
<TE>   Others say Bin Laden is irreplaceable--and that Al Qaeda will morph
again when he's gone.</TE>
<TE>   "If Bin Laden is killed or captured, there is no identified successor
capable of rallying so many divergent nationalities, interests and groups
to create the kind of cohesion he fostered among Sunni Islamic extremists
around the world," Vice Adm. Thomas R. Wilson, head of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, said in written testimony last month to the Senate
Intelligence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "Bin Laden is synonymous with Al Qaeda, and the media attention he has
garnered, along with his charisma and other attributes, have made him an
inspirational rallying point for like-minded extremists," Wilson said.
"With Bin Laden's removal, the network most likely will eventually
fragment under various lieutenants pursuing differing agendas with
differing priorities."</TE>

<HD>Mexico Captures Tijuana Drug Lord</HD>
<DH>Narcotics: The arrest, and the recent death of another Arellano
Felix leader, could spark a power struggle within and outside the cartel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>Declaring one of the world's most powerful drug gangs "dismantled,"
Mexican authorities announced the capture of Tijuana drug mobster
Benjamin Arellano Felix on Saturday while confirming the death of his
brother Ramon in a police shootout last month.</LD>
<LD>   The blows to the Tijuana cartel are significant because it is thought
to control a quarter of all cocaine entering the United States from
Mexico. Both brothers were on the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's
most-wanted list and carried $2-million bounties for their arrests.</LD>
<LD>   Both also had eluded justice for a decade, protected by layers of
corrupt police, judges and politicians in Mexico who had been co-opted by
millions of dollars in bribes or intimidated by death threats that Ramon
allegedly enjoyed carrying out.</LD>
<TE>   The downfall of the Arellano Felix brothers will by no means bring the
flow of drugs from Mexico to the United States to a halt. It could in
fact raise the curtain on a bloody new struggle for power both within and
outside the gang for the control of the lucrative Western drug-smuggling
corridor.</TE>
<TE>   Crusading Tijuana journalist Jesus Blancornelas said other members of
the numerous Arellano Felix clan may step into the leadership breach.
Brother Eduardo, a 48-year-old doctor, is the most likely to emerge as
the new leader, said Blancornelas, who survived an Arellano Felix-led
assassination attempt in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   But the arrest of Benjamin, 49, the brains and chief executive of the
cartel, and the death of Ramon, a ruthless enforcer responsible for
hundreds of killings, drives a stake into a many-tentacled crime
syndicate. Mexican and U.S. officials lauded the armed forces' arrest of
Benjamin early Saturday as one of the most important blows yet struck
against Mexican narco-traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a great triumph for justice and for the Mexican army . . . and
just one step in the work we have to do this year," President Vicente Fox
said in a statement. Fox's government has arrested several mid-level
narco-traffickers since taking office 15 months ago, but a "big fish" had
eluded it until Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, the arrest of Benjamin, who guided the growth of
the cartel, was seen by many as the clearest sign yet that the Fox
administration is serious about the war on drugs.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, DEA chief Asa Hutchinson praised Fox in a telephone
interview for "going after this very powerful and very violent
organization. . . . No one thought it could be done. The full credit goes
to the Mexican government."</TE>
<TE>   Charles G. La Bella, a former U.S. attorney in San Diego who helped
lead the government's antidrug efforts there during most of the 1990s,
said the arrest of Benjamin, and of several other drug kingpins over the
last year, represents the biggest burst of "anti-drug activity from
Mexico in the last 30 years."</TE>
<TE>   "But unless there is credible and consistent law enforcement
commitment in Mexico to attack drug trafficking, this is just going to be
a change of names" at the top, said La Bella, now an attorney in private
practice in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Atty. Gen. Rafael Macedo de la Concha and Defense Secretary
Ricardo Vega held an early-morning news conference Saturday to announce
the capture and to declare that evidence points convincingly to Ramon
Arellano Felix's having died in a Feb. 10 police shootout in the port
city of Mazatlan.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican army units captured Benjamin Arellano Felix in a 1 a.m. raid
in the wealthy Escondida neighborhood of Puebla, about 100 miles east of
the capital. Also arrested was associate Manuel Martinez Gonzalez, alias
"La Mojarra," or Big Fish. Arellano Felix's wife and two children were
present during the capture but were not taken into custody.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest capped what officials said was a four-month pursuit.
Arellano Felix was later taken to an unspecified "secure location" and
was scheduled to be jailed at the La Palma prison in suburban Mexico
City.</TE>
<TE>   One of two men killed in the February shootout in a Mazatlan public
square was initially identified as Jorge Perez. But reports soon emerged
that the victim was Ramon Arellano Felix, who had been using false
identification papers during a trip to Mazatlan to settle scores with a
rival trafficker, Ismael Zambada.</TE>
<TE>   Macedo said authorities' confirmation of Ramon's death was based on
fingerprints and on Benjamin's statement after his capture that his
brother indeed had died. The government played a video for reporters that
showed Benjamin responding "Yes" when asked whether his brother had been
killed in the Mazatlan shootout.</TE>
<TE>   Vega said a small altar with a photo of Ramon that was found in the
Puebla house where Benjamin was arrested "makes one assume he died."</TE>
<TE>   Still, DNA analysis of the victim's bloodstained shirt has not been
completed. The body was cremated, and the blood, the morgue photos and
the fingerprints on his 9-millimeter revolver are the only evidence
authorities have to go on.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials on a special Arellano Felix task force based in San
Diego said they would await the results of DNA tests before being certain
about the victim's identity. Technicians are comparing a blood sample
taken from the body at the scene of the shootout with a sample believed
to be from Ramon's brother Francisco, now in jail.</TE>
<TE>   William Gore, the special agent in charge of the FBI office in San
Diego, said it would be "premature" to dismantle the U.S. task force
formed to target the Arellano Felix cartel six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody believes that drugs will stop flowing into the United States
from northern Baja. [The question is] who's going to take over that
turf," Gore said. "Is it going to be a peaceful takeover or a violent
takeover? That's what we're watching."</TE>
<TE>   The Arellano Felix family, including six brothers and at least two
sisters, is thought to have arrived in Tijuana from Sinaloa state in the
mid-1980s, having been given the Baja California liquor and cigarette
smuggling turf by an uncle, Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo. The family soon
expanded its trade into marijuana and then cocaine, slowly consolidating
a regional monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, the Arellano Felixes were adept at melding into
Tijuana's moneyed class and recruiting the wealthy sons of business and
professional elites, dubbed "narco juniors," as hit men. They also
recruited assassins from gangs in the Barrio Logan section of San Diego,
who, among other hits, tried to kill Blancornelas, editor of the
newspaper Zeta.</TE>
<TE>   While bribing police and politicians at the rate of a rumored $1
million a day, they were also building relationships with legitimate
businesses that laundered drug cash. A dozen such Baja businesses were
recently named by the U.S. government as off limits to U.S. trade.</TE>
<TE>   The Arellano Felixes bought political influence by financing
candidates' electoral campaigns, said Jose Luis Perez Canchola, former
Baja California state prosecutor in charge of human rights and now an
attorney with the Mexico City district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "What set the Arellanos apart was their entrepreneurial vision," said
Victor Alfaro Clark, director of the Tijuana-based Binational Commission
on Human Rights and a visiting professor at San Diego State University.</TE>
<TE>   The family's vicious modus operandi--summed up as "bribes or
bullets"--co-opted the highest levels of Mexican police and government.
Many who didn't accept bribes were killed in brutal fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "You either have to take money from them or die," DEA Special Agent
Donald Thornhill said in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Among the hundreds of Arellano Felix victims were federal prosecutors
and local police officials. Although each of the three or four main
Mexican drug cartels was violent in its way, the Arellano Felixes were
especially brutal, often sadistic killers.</TE>
<TE>   They burst into notoriety in May 1993 when gunmen allegedly led by
Ramon and including Barrio Logan thugs killed Mexican Cardinal Juan Jesus
Posadas Ocampo during what is believed to have been a botched attempt at
assassinating a rival drug boss.</TE>
<TE>   That Ramon Arellano Felix would have been present at assassinations,
when he could have easily sent squads of hit men, doesn't surprise those
familiar with his career.</TE>
<TE>   "He was crazy and bloodthirsty," Thornhill said.</TE>

<HD>3 Months After Ill Woman Vanishes, Mystery Deepens</HD>
<DH>Loss: Questions torment the family of Margie Dabney, who has
Alzheimer's and disappeared at an airport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Dabney is not doing so well. Slumped in his wheelchair, he
gazes into the closet of his Bakersfield apartment, a bare bulb
illuminating two lonely shirts. There's a boxed tinsel tree that never
made it out for Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   Then he points to the suitcases.</LD>
<LD>   After three months, he still cannot bear to open them. His wife was
the last to close them, the morning she vanished.</LD>
<TE>   Margie Dabney at 70 suffers from Alzheimer's disease and is lost in
America--most likely Dallas-Fort Worth, but who can say?</TE>
<TE>   An American Airlines attendant assigned to get the couple to their
connecting gate failed to keep track of her, her family says. The airline
says the wheelchair aide may not have realized he was responsible for
both Dabneys, nor that Margie had Alzheimer's.</TE>
<TE>   And so Margie Dabney, like millions of Americans with Alzheimer's
disease, wandered away.</TE>
<TE>   Once police at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport joined the
case, they made an assumption that Alzheimer's advocates fear will prove
lethal: that officers would find the missing woman on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Margie Dabney vanished after her plane landed about 10 a.m. Wednesday,
Dec. 5. The airport did not contact reporters until late Friday, when
local TV stations broadcast her picture.</TE>
<TE>   "The first two hours are critical," said Brian Hance of the national
Alzheimer's Assn., who runs its Safe Return program. "Nearly 60% of
people with Alzheimer's will wander at some point in the progression of
the disease. If they're not found within 24 hours, at least 46% may die,
normally succumbing to hypothermia or dehydration."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 4 million Americans are afflicted with the disease that
progressively robs all memory. By the year 2050, that number is expected
to grow to 14 million.</TE>
<TE>   Since Margie Dabney's disappearance, the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport's
18,000 acres have been searched by ground and air. Hospital psychiatric
wards, churches, truck stops and morgues have been checked. Activists who
do a monthly homeless count on the streets of Dallas circulated more than
5,000 fliers seeking information on her whereabouts. American Airlines
hired a private investigator who remains on the case. So far, not a
trace.</TE>
<TE>   Much is disputed about this doomed journey by a poor couple, who
struggled with aging and completely relied on each other. But this much
is agreed upon: Margie Louis Dabney is a 95-pound African American woman
who takes medication for high blood pressure and diabetes. She and her
husband were flying from Indianapolis to Los Angeles, with a plane change
in Dallas. A flight attendant delivered them to a wheelchair aide at Gate
35 to escort them to Gate 39, and Margie Dabney never got there.</TE>
<TE>   "Poof! This woman is gone," said Cherry Hogan, family assistance
coordinator for the Dallas chapter of the Alzheimer's Assn., whose mother
succumbed to the disease last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "That airport is like a city. Trains underground. Buses going
everywhere. There are whole lines of taxis sitting outside. Did someone
usher her into a cab? Is she inside that airport still?"</TE>
<TE>Questions Linger as Search Winds Down</TE>
<TE>   As the formal search winds down for lack of leads, disturbing
questions linger:</TE>
<TE>   Should the airline, which typically places a "special needs" badge
around such a passenger's neck, have done more to inform the attendant?</TE>
<TE>   Should the airport police department have been better prepared to
handle the very common problem of wandering by the memory-impaired?
Should they have alerted the media sooner?</TE>
<TE>   And finally, should Joe Dabney--who says he had an ugly argument with
the attendant to ignore the wheelchair and keep track of his wife--have
better conveyed her tendency to wander off?</TE>
<TE>   The airline says Margie Dabney boarded the plane with a special needs
badge, but airline staff could find no one who recalls seeing her wearing
it when she got off the aircraft in Dallas. American says Joe Dabney only
mentioned his wife's Alzheimer's to the attendant after she failed to
emerge from a restroom.</TE>
<TE>   Margie Dabney wore no medical ID bracelet. She had once been lost for
three days in Bakersfield after she wandered away from a Greyhound bus
depot while Joe used the restroom. And her wandering was the whole reason
for her trip to Indiana, so that family members could watch over her
while Joe Dabney had hip surgery.</TE>
<TE>   But Margie Dabney slipped out of her daughter's house and went to a
nearby hospital in search of Joe, he said. His daughter, he said, felt
forced to lock her mother inside the house whenever she had to work.</TE>
<TE>   Joe and Margie have been married 34 years. They have 10 children, two
of their own and eight from Margie's previous marriage. The children are
scattered in various states and had jobs that prevented them from staying
home with their mother constantly. Joe Dabney, a cab driver, has suffered
from pain ever since a bad traffic accident.</TE>
<TE>   But he had his memory, he figured, and Margie could walk and push him.
As long as they stuck together, he thought, things would be all right.
But now she's gone.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want is my wife. She really was the only woman I ever loved,"
Joe Dabney said, bowing his head. "I just want to know that she's OK,
what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Memory-impaired people like Margie Dabney who wander usually do so
chronically, and for very personal reasons. Relatives and caregivers of
Alzheimer's patients say they wander in search of a self they recognize,
an accomplished self who was once a doctor or teacher or stay-at-home
mom.</TE>
<TE>   "They set out for their childhood home, somewhere in their memory
where they lived in a . . . place where they felt normal and safe and
happy," said Hance of the Safe Return program.</TE>
<TE>   For $40, any memory-impaired person can be registered in the program
through the Alzheimer's Assn. at http://www.alz.org or (888) 572-8566. A
bracelet or necklace will identify the person, their memory problem and a
24-hour toll-free number for Safe Return. Local police and media are
swiftly contacted.</TE>
<TE>   Margie Dabney fit the pattern of the typical Alzheimer's wanderer. She
sought out hospitals, where she would insistently ask for her husband or
her mother, who died in 2000, Joe Dabney said. That was about the time he
realized his wife was not herself.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 5, the Dabneys' flight landed in Dallas around 10:15 a.m.
Normally Margie would push Joe's wheelchair, but the attendant took over,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The airline maintains that the attendant escorted Joe Dabney to the
restroom at his request and that Margie Dabney went into the women's
facility. When she did not come out, the attendant sent in a female aide,
who could not locate her. She was reported missing at the gate and, after
a search by airline personnel of other gates and restrooms failed to find
her, airport police were alerted.</TE>
<TE>   American Airlines contacted police 75 minutes after Margie Dabney
landed because it thought she would be found, said airport spokesman Ken
Capps.</TE>
<TE>   "I do want the airlines to speak about the airlines, but what happened
on the hand-off between the airplane and the gate agent is the critical
point," Capps said. "What I have said several times is that the airport
did not lose Mrs. Dabney, but the airport has tried valiantly to find
her."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Dabney blames all of them for losing his wife. So does his
daughter Candace Price. She has spent weeks in Dallas, shuffling to and
from Indianapolis so she can hunt for her mother. She is a long-haul
truck driver who keeps hoping to get a Texas job until her mom is found.</TE>
<TE>   "These people have no idea what this has done to my family," Price
said, steering a big rig one night through Waco, Texas. "I didn't pay my
car note at Christmastime so I could afford to fly down the first time.
By then, they had put my poor father on a plane and flown him home
without my mom."</TE>
<TE>   Even this is disputed. On Dec. 5 Joe Dabney had no money and no help,
and he was cussing mad. Dabney said he got rolled onto a 3 p.m. flight
back to Los Angeles and could do little about it but sob the whole way.
He had to catch a Greyhound for Bakersfield after that.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a fool to let them put me on that plane, wasn't I?" Dabney
said.</TE>
<TE>   American spokeswoman Andrea Rader argued that other Dabney relatives
said it was OK to put him on the L.A.-bound plane and that American
offered him a free flight back to Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "It came to be time to say, 'Look, there's not much more we can do for
you here, Mr. Dabney,' " Rader explained. "Mr. Dabney became agitated
with that."</TE>
<TE>   American Airlines extended other offers to family for free tickets to
and from Dallas as the search wore on.</TE>
<TE>   Does the world's largest airline take any responsibility for losing
this passenger?</TE>
<TE>   "That's a tough question to answer," Rader said late last month,
"because there's a lot of nuances to it, and a lot of things we just
don't know at this stage of things. Our actions certainly say that this
was a terrible thing that happened to one of our customers, that we
really pulled out the stops."</TE>
<TE>   And the airport? Does it take any responsibility?</TE>
<TE>   "We feel quite comfortable in our efforts in this case," spokesman
Capps said, adding that the airport police will be undergoing training by
the local Alzheimer's Assn. on how to respond when a memory-impaired
person goes missing.</TE>
<TE>   Candace Price won't be moving on, not yet.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked it over with my husband, and we decided it's best for me
to stay here," Price said. "I cannot leave here without her."</TE>

<HD>Suicide Bomber Kills 12 at Busy Jerusalem Cafe</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The explosion, which injures more than 50, comes on the
heels of a deadly attack on Israel's coast.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>The Cafe Moment, across the street here from the official residence
of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, was packed Saturday night with teenagers
and well-heeled Israelis who frequently converge at the trendy eatery.
Suddenly, a Palestinian stepped just inside the front door and detonated
a devastating bomb, killing 12 people and wounding more than 50 others.</LD>
<LD>   The suicide bombing came two hours after a pair of Palestinian gunmen
opened fire on a strip of hotels in the seaside Israeli town of Netanya,
killing a baby and wounding 50 people before being shot dead themselves.
A second Israeli also was killed, possibly accidentally by police.</LD>
<LD>   In earthshaking retaliation, the Israeli air force early today pumped
more than 30 missiles into the Gaza City headquarters of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat, reducing the compound to a smoldering
pile of rubble.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, Israeli forces stormed another Palestinian refugee camp
and killed several Palestinians, including a 15-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks came as both sides welcomed the Bush administration's
decision to return U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni to the region this week,
and one day after Sharon dropped his demand for seven days of quiet
before negotiations can start.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed by the ever-growing spiral of violence engulfing Israelis and
Palestinians, President Bush announced Thursday that he was sending Zinni
to try again to secure a cease-fire. The retired Marine Corps general's
first mission, in December, collapsed as violence flared.</TE>
<TE>   But any hope that peacemaking might now be gaining momentum after
months of death and destruction has been battered by Israel's ongoing
military offensive across the West Bank and Gaza Strip and by the
escalating Palestinian revenge attacks.</TE>
<TE>   All of Israel had been bracing for some sort of Palestinian reprisal
after the bloodiest week in the 17-month-old conflict was capped Friday
with an all-time-high death toll. Saturday night marks the end of the
Jewish Sabbath, and Israelis flood places of entertainment, restaurants
and banquet halls--prime targets.</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem, every table was taken at the popular Cafe Moment, a
favorite haunt of the city's elite, and patrons were lined up outside the
front door. A Palestinian later identified as a 20-year-old refugee from
the Arob camp near the West Bank city of Hebron waded into the crowd and
inched inside the door. There, he blew himself to bits, sending bodies,
tables and chairs flying in the massive explosion. The powerful bomb
spewed nails and other metal bits that had been packed inside for maximum
lethal effect.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, whose walled residential compound is about 100 yards away, was
not at home. The radical Islamic movement Hamas claimed responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't move, there were so many bodies," said a woman who gave
only her first name, Segal. She was sitting inside the cafe when the
blast occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "There was screaming, things full of blood fell on us," she said
before being loaded into an ambulance. "People were screaming. People
didn't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   Survivors climbed out of windows as the acrid smell of gunpowder and
the cries of the wounded filled the air. Police and rescue crews
descended on the site within minutes, and helicopters with searchlights
hovered overhead. Some of the dead were still sitting in their chairs,
witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Ran Yaakoby, an official with the Foreign Ministry, was thrown to the
floor by the force of the blast. He pulled a table over his head for
protection, then led a friend to safety through a window.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of people, dead or injured, in the cafe and outside
of it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At one of the several hospitals that received victims, a waitress, who
declined to give her name, said she had spotted the bomber just before he
exploded.</TE>
<TE>   "He was standing at the entrance, right inside the door," she said. "I
was on my way from the bar to the front door to give someone a bill when
there was this terrible noise. People were on top of each other, and then
it was very quiet, and I ran to the kitchen and climbed through a
window."</TE>
<TE>   Another survivor, a middle-aged man with a cut above his brow, echoed
the feeling of many Israelis who see their sphere of safety shrinking by
the day. "We always went to the Moment cafe because it's next to the
prime minister's home," he told reporters at the hospital. "We always
thought that was one safe place."</TE>
<TE>   At the cafe, in the affluent Rehavia neighborhood, shocked survivors
milled around outside as ambulances carted away the wounded. Black
plastic body bags were lined up in the stone courtyard of the restaurant
before they too were removed. Burial society workers scoured the site for
blood and body parts, working well past midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Blood could be seen on the restaurant's facade and about 50 yards down
the road. Many of the cafe's front windows were shattered, yet two green
neon signs saying "Moment" in Hebrew were undamaged, and glasses and
coffee cups were stacked on the bar inside, unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   Between the cafe and Sharon's home lies tiny Paris Square, where
hundreds of peace activists had demonstrated earlier in the evening,
calling on Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza. Sharon was at
his Negev desert ranch at the time of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving at the scene, the Israeli mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert,
said police had foiled four other suicide attacks in Jerusalem in the
previous four days. He blamed Arafat for "inciting and condoning" the
violence.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a hard war, and the battlefield is our home," Olmert said.
"They want to spill Jewish blood. A lot of it."</TE>
<TE>   The bombing of Cafe Moment came just two days after a would-be bomber
walked into another popular Jerusalem cafe, this one in the yuppie German
Colony in southern Jerusalem during lunch hour. He was overpowered by the
wait staff before he could detonate what police later said was a large
bomb hidden in the backpack he carried.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't protect every citizen in every place, and this is true for
cafes, wedding halls, buses," said Israel's police chief, Shlomo
Aharonishky.</TE>
<TE>   In Netanya, the town's seaside promenade was crowded Saturday evening
with people out for a stroll in the balmy air. At one of the hotels that
line the street, a party honoring a man about to marry came under fire
abruptly from two Palestinian gunmen who hurled grenades and shot
automatic weapons into the lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Police and armed bystanders gave chase, eventually shooting and
killing the two Palestinians. A third man who was killed in the shooting
was initially thought to have been another attacker but was later
identified as an Israeli.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the hotel, where pools of blood covered the lobby floor, a
9-month-old baby died. About 50 people were hurt in the shooting spree.
Ambulances took away bloodied victims, most of whom wore the modest dress
of Orthodox Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli television reported that the Palestinian assailants were
disguised as Israeli police.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an underground militia affiliated with
Arafat's Fatah movement, claimed responsibility for the Netanya shootings
and said they were conducted in retaliation for Israel's raids into
refugee camps. Like the suicide bomber in Jerusalem, the Netanya shooters
hailed from refugee camps, which Israel maintains are hotbeds of armed
resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's retaliation today included the destruction of Arafat's Gaza
headquarters, the site of his frequent meetings with world leaders and a
symbol of his power. He was not present, confined by Israel to the city
of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the Jerusalem and Netanya incidents, however, Israel
continued attacking Palestinian security targets and refugee camps
Saturday, demolishing homes and killing at least three Palestinians as it
pressed its hunt for militants. Nida Azza, 15, was killed by an Israeli
sniper, her family said, as she stood outside her home in Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli armor and infantry also surrounded the Dahaisha refugee camp
outside Bethlehem and took up positions just inside its boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Israel launched two waves of aerial strikes, hitting Gaza
City and the cities of Ramallah, Nablus, Hebron and Bethlehem in the West
Bank. In Ramallah, an Israeli missile slammed into a car belonging to a
wanted militia commander, Abdel Karim Aweis, killing his brother but not
him.</TE>
<TE>   At the Tulkarm refugee camps in the West Bank, Israeli troops pulled
out after a siege of several days, the army said, but more than 500
Palestinian men had been rounded up and taken in for questioning.</TE>

<DH>War: TV technician tells of being forced to install satellite
dishes in cave complex. He says Al Qaeda and Taliban troops are
relatively secure there.</DH>

<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GARDEZ, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A man who claims he was abducted and taken to the Al Qaeda and
Taliban mountain base now under siege by the U.S. military estimated
Saturday that more than 1,000 fighters are there and said they have
managed to remain relatively secure inside their elaborate caves despite
heavy American bombing.</LD>
<LD>   Abdul Rahman Beheshti, a 22-year-old satellite television technician,
would be the first eyewitness to speak out about recent events inside the
Shahi Kot cave complex, where a combined force of Afghan Taliban and
foreign Al Qaeda fighters has held out despite an intensive, eight-day
U.S.-led air and ground campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Although his account could not be independently verified, Beheshti
sounded convincing as he sat nervously in a dingy restaurant and later at
a private house and for almost 2 1/2 hours described being captured,
moved from cave to cave, and eventually let go after seven days during
which he installed and programmed five satellite TV dishes and receivers
for his captors.</LD>
<TE>   The assault on the Shahi Kot complex began March 2, but so far the
only information about it has come from U.S. military spokesmen and some
of their Afghan allies--reporting that the Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters
have suffered more than 500 dead, that their escape routes are being
choked off and that they are near to being wiped out or surrendering.</TE>
<TE>   Navy Lt. Timothy Boehlke, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command in
Tampa, Fla., which is directing the war, said the tempo of the battle
near the eastern city of Gardez had changed little Saturday as airstrikes
and ground activity continued. No additional casualties had been reported
within the U.S.-led coalition, which continued to dominate the battle,
Boehlke said.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like the majority is coming from our end as far as
activity," he said. "We're not receiving a whole lot back."</TE>
<TE>   Beheshti's account, given to a small group of reporters that included
representatives of the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post,
presented a sharply different view. He said that the Taliban and Al Qaeda
forces deep inside their granite caves are amply supplied with arms, food
and creature comforts, including portable televisions.</TE>
<TE>   He said that they are well sheltered and that from the caves in which
he was held, he could barely hear bombs falling in the distance. During
the course of the week, he said, he saw only two dead Talibs.</TE>
<TE>   Beheshti, a boyish-looking man with a shock of black hair and a thin
beard, said that he was held in a series of caves dug out of the sides of
the mountains. He said that judging from the large number of fighters who
crowded into the caves when the bombing started, and those whom he could
see when he was being moved around, he believes that more than 1,000
fighters are there.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Beheshti said, the caves had arched ceilings, and
their floors were covered in carpets, with pillows and mattresses lining
the walls. Light came from solar-powered tube lamps, he said, and some of
the caves had paved terraces in front.</TE>
<TE>   The caves had many entrances and exits and were often connected to one
another, he said. Some were used to store weapons and ammunition, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from himself, Beheshti said, his captors had one Western
prisoner with them who had been taken captive sometime earlier, before
the beginning of the assault on Shahi Kot, and who was being regularly
tortured with severe beatings. Beheshti said that the captive was tall
and light-haired and spoke English but that he did not know his
nationality.</TE>
<TE>Other Captives Are Seen</TE>
<TE>   During the week, the Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters also captured about
seven Afghans who they said had been fighting alongside the Americans,
Beheshti said. He said they were later taken away, apparently to be let
go.</TE>
<TE>   According to Beheshti, his seven-day ordeal began when a man came to
his workshop in Gardez on March 1 and asked him to install a satellite
dish in the town of Zormat, southwest of Gardez.</TE>
<TE>   But when he got there, he said, he was instead taken farther, to a
village named Kolalgu. From there, he said, he was forced at gunpoint
into a pickup truck, blindfolded and eventually led on foot into the
Shahi Kot cave complex, where he was informed that he was a prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   Beheshti said he was held by an Arab who was called simply "the
Sheik." The first night, he said, he was tied up with rope around his
arms and legs and beaten on the soles of his feet with sticks. The
Taliban fighters chastised him for installing satellite television dishes
in private homes, which his captors said was sinful and un-Islamic.</TE>
<TE>   Later, however, he realized that they were interested in him mainly
because he was a technician able to install satellite dishes and program
TV channels for them to watch as a way to obtain information, he said.</TE>
<TE>   His captors--who he said were mostly Afghan Talibs, although there
were a fair number of Al Qaeda Arabs as well--demanded that the satellite
dishes he installed be able to tune in the Al Jazeera channel, a pan-Arab
news station based in Qatar and frequently used by Osama bin Laden as a
means to broadcast his views to the world. They also wanted to watch
other Arabic-language channels, Beheshti said.</TE>
<TE>No Interest in Surrender</TE>
<TE>   He said he thinks he was freed only after a friend of his father came
to the caves and pleaded for him and after he had successfully completed
all the technical tasks asked of him. He also said that he was instructed
to deliver a message that the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Shahi Kot are not
interested in surrendering and that their fellow Afghans should not
cooperate with the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not expect that they would release me so easily. I thought that
after fixing those satellite receivers, I would be killed, so other
people would not know," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the first day of the bombing, Beheshti said, he saw the overall
commander of the Shahi Kot complex, Saifur Rahman Mansour, who lost one
hand and part of another in previous Afghan wars. As he recalled, Rahman
looked nervous and was moving and talking very quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone is scared, you can see it in his face," he said of
Rahman.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman, a mullah who had been a military commander for the Taliban,
told the fighters during a religious speech that they should prepare to
be martyrs, Beheshti said.</TE>
<TE>   "He said that we should have our burial shrouds with us all the time
and be martyrs for the sake of our country and fight until the last man,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday morning, when he was about to be freed, Beheshti said, he
heard some of the Afghan fighters talking and laughing about a peace
proposal that had just arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard them say that from Gardez they had sent a message saying that
they should all surrender. They were talking about it and laughing,
saying things like, 'OK, let's go. Let's surrender.' "</TE>
<TE>   "They will not surrender," Beheshti said. "They want to either win the
war or to be martyred."</TE>

<HD>Learning to Walk Again From Experts in Taking the First Step</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Most of the therapists at a Kabul rehabilitation center
use prostheses themselves. Many are victims of land mines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>In the gloom of the men's ward stood Farid Aqa, hobbling on a
damaged leg. At his elbow was Said Musa, a physical therapist, both legs
securely planted as he led 13-year-old Farid through exercises.</LD>
<LD>   The boy's left leg had been blown off by a land mine. So had the left
leg of his therapist. The boy struggled to walk on a new prosthesis. The
therapist walked with grace and precision on his artificial leg.</LD>
<LD>   And that, essentially, is the difference between the staff and the
patients at the ICRC Orthopedic Center of Kabul.</LD>
<TE>   Eighty percent of the patients are land mine victims. Eighty-five
percent of the staff members are amputees too, mostly because of land
mine wounds that first brought them to the center.</TE>
<TE>   New patients come to be fitted for prostheses, and to learn to walk
and function in society as effortlessly as the therapists who teach them.
Their plastic legs and arms, and their wheelchairs and crutches, are made
in the center by former patients disabled or disfigured by land mines.</TE>
<TE>   There they are in the dimly lighted machine shop, young men and old
men missing an eye, a hand, a leg, two legs. They mold hot plastic into
artificial arms and legs, fashion rubber from old Russian tanks into
orthopedic shoe heels, and turn old bicycle tires into wheelchair wheels.</TE>
<TE>   Their patients keep coming, dozens more every week, their limbs blown
off in a country that is one of the most heavily mined in the world. The
center, run by the International Committee of the Red Cross, has treated
26,000 amputees and churned out 39,000 prostheses since opening in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Dashing from room to room on two good legs, greeting staff and
patients in Dari and English and a smattering of Italian, is Alberto
Cairo, the center's charismatic director. Cairo, a slender Italian lawyer
with a manic personality, seems to be everywhere at once, cracking jokes
with the men, teasing the women, hugging the children.</TE>
<TE>   Cairo is the force behind the center, having arrived in Kabul in 1990
to revitalize the operation and gradually expand it. He has survived half
a dozen governments, from the Communists to warring moujahedeen to the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter which regime is in power, our patients need the same kind
of help," Cairo said one morning, moving between the wards in a white
smock with "Alberto" written in red marker on a piece of masking tape
over the breast pocket.</TE>
<TE>   It was a busy morning. In the machine shops, men bent over lathes,
breathing in the sharp odor of hot plastic seeping from the ovens. Cairo
spotted a big, bearded worker with a missing leg and shouted: "Watch that
one--he's Al Qaeda!" The big man laughed and continued his work at the
lathe, but not before threatening to smack the director with a
half-completed leg.</TE>
<TE>   Cairo, who says he quit his law practice to earn a degree in physical
therapy, cajoles and admonishes his patients. "I tell them to stop
thinking about what they have lost," he said, "and to think only about
what is now possible."</TE>
<TE>   Without the center, many of the amputees would have been left by
family members to sit alone at home day and night, or to crawl in the
street to beg. Cairo searches the streets for amputee beggars, hauling
them in for prostheses and therapy. Sometimes he spots them months later,
back to begging, their artificial legs carefully hidden away.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, the center has extended its services beyond land mine
victims to assist all disabled people--those with polio, spinal injuries,
birth defects, cerebral palsy, and victims of falls and car accidents.
Men and women are admitted equally.</TE>
<TE>   During the Taliban era, Cairo said, the center was inspected almost
daily by Talibs who measured the beards of male staffers and made certain
that men and women were strictly segregated. The Taliban insisted that
women receive therapy only from women, though Cairo said several Talibs
secretly begged him to come to their homes to help their disabled wives
or sisters.</TE>
<TE>   The Talibs also demanded that Cairo remove the red cross he wears on
his lapel, saying it was a banned Christian symbol. He refused, he said,
and the Talibs cursed him and called him kafir, an apostate, but finally
relented.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the center sends male and female amputee staffers on home
visits to amputee patients. It provides vocational training and operates
a job center that it says has provided more than 200 patients with jobs
at Western aid organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The center's micro-credit office provides $100 loans to patients to
help them start small retail businesses. Said Mujtaba, who lost a leg to
a land mine, is the micro-credit director. He rides a bicycle 25 to 30
miles a day, he said, checking up on clients and making sure that loan
recipients repay in 18 months, no interest.</TE>
<TE>   The center also trains teachers who provide home lessons to amputee
children. About 35% of the country's land mine victims are younger than
14, Cairo said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the teachers is Obaidullah Mihr, a former soldier who lost his
left leg to a land mine. Five days a week, Mihr rides his bicycle 12
miles through Kabul's choking morning traffic to the mud hut of Mohammed
Ashraf, a slender boy of 16 whose legs were paralyzed by a rocket attack
when he was 7.</TE>
<TE>   The youth sat on his bed one morning as Mihr, wearing his army fatigue
jacket, taught him an hourlong lesson in 16th century Afghan history.
Ashraf said he wants to earn a degree, improve his English and get a job
as a computer programmer.</TE>
<TE>   Cairo often teases the boy about his desire to one day live in
America. "I tell him America is a terrible, wicked place," the director
said. "I don't want him to leave. I would miss him too much."</TE>
<TE>   Cairo, who is single, said his patients are his family. "I give them
so little. They give me so much. I'm a very privileged man, eh?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the men's therapeutic ward, Cairo stood watching as men and
boys with missing legs and feet learned to walk with prostheses. It was
difficult work. They had to walk on concrete, up a stairway, across a
wooden platform, down a muddy dirt path and, worst of all, along a
pathway of stones and pebbles. Many of the amputees stumbled or fell, but
the therapists caught them, bracing themselves on their own prostheses.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby were two bicycle frames with the wheels raised. There, the
amputees learn to ride bicycles, the most common form of transportation
in Kabul, the Afghan capital.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the floor of the men's ward was littered with artificial legs.
The patients had put them aside as they rested on benches, raising the
stumps of their legs to warm them beside kerosene stoves glowing in the
chilly room.</TE>
<TE>   There was Abdul Wasay, a boy of 13 who looked no older than 10, whose
legs were blown off by a land mine near the Kabul airport. Next to him
was Said Mirza Ali, a bony man of 65 who was twice cursed. He had lost
three fingers and a thumb to a Russian mine 16 years ago, he said. And
last year, he said, he was shot by the Taliban in northern Afghanistan
and had his wounded leg amputated after an agonizing nine-hour car ride
to a hospital in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the women's ward was Sahar Gul, a 2-year-old wearing a red
dress. Her legs withered by polio, she took tiny steps with specially
made mini-crutches and leg braces from the center, her father supporting
her as she inched across the walkway.</TE>
<TE>   On and on the amputees walked, 250 to 300 of them in all, up and back,
up and back, their therapists beside them.</TE>
<TE>   "Some say this is such a sad place," Cairo said, watching them come
and go in the shadows of the ward. "I say, no, no, this is a very, very
happy place. This is where life begins again."</TE>

<LD>   The gunmen, who left without wounding anyone, were apparently trying
to capture or harm fiery Roman Catholic priest Ejike Mbaka, who was
leading the prayer meeting Thursday night, said diocese spokesman the
Rev. Evans Offor.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting had been organized by the Roman Catholic Church on the
grounds of a technical college. The Rev. Obiora Ike, vicar-general of the
Roman Catholic Diocese of Enugu, said the gunmen broke into the open-air
meeting just as it was ending.</LD>
<TE>   The independent Vanguard newspaper quoted Offor as saying that the
victims were trying to escape the gunmen who stormed the venue.</TE>
<TE>   "These people looked like thugs, hired assassins. When they began to
harass people at the gate, people became so much afraid and there was
pandemonium," Offor said, according to the paper.</TE>
<TE>   There were differing accounts of the number of dead. Ike said at least
14 people were killed, while police commissioner Idris Mohammed said at
least 12 people were confirmed dead. Authorities were investigating
reports of two other deaths, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The prayer meetings are regularly attended by thousands of people
hoping to be saved from poverty and disease.</TE>
<TE>   Mbaka has been repeatedly harassed and sought by Enugu state
government officials for questioning, Offor said. He did not elaborate,
and government officials were not immediately available for comment.
However, police said they were not looking for Mbaka.</TE>

<HD>A Radicals' Haven Sets Out to Change Its Image</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Yemen turned to the U.S. for help in fighting terror, and
not everyone in the long-insular nation is happy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANA, Yemen
</DL>
<LD>The call to prayer echoed over the ancient walled city of Bab al
Yaman, capital of a land that legend has it was ruled by the Queen of
Sheba. Hundreds of men wearing long white robes, with daggers tucked in
their belts, filed into the Ishak Mosque.</LD>
<LD>   The men prayed as their ancestors have for centuries and then received
a message from their imam that has lately become as integral a part of
the Friday ritual as the prayer itself: It comprised distrust of the
West, anger at Israel and a call to oppose America for supporting the
Jewish state.</LD>
<LD>   "Look how the Israelis are killing our brothers in Islam every day,"
said Nabil Hossein Gharari, the 26-year-old who led the prayers. "When I
watch them on television, my eyes want to cry blood, not tears, because
these actions are the real terrorism. So I urge people to support the
Palestinians' actions . . . and to stop buying any Israeli or American
products."</LD>
<TE>   In a not-too-subtle reference to battles far beyond the borders of
Israel, Gharari added, "Please God, support moujahedeen all over the
world."</TE>
<TE>A Place to Disappear</TE>
<TE>   The modern dogma of suspicion of the United States and hatred of
Israel has taken root in this ancient country, flourishing on the barren,
sharp mountains and towering stone cliffs that are home to many of its 18
million people. Yemen's geographic isolation and its history of violent
politics, combined with decades of extraordinary poverty, have
transformed it into an outlaw state--a perfect haven for terrorists
looking to strike and then hide, to cause devastation and disappear into
the shadows.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. received proof positive of this in October 2000, when suicide
bombers blew a hole in the Navy's guided-missile destroyer Cole while it
was anchored in the port of Aden, killing 17 American sailors. The attack
remains unsolved.</TE>
<TE>   Just Thursday, the U.S. Embassy issued a warning about the
"possibility of imminent terrorist targeting of U.S. interests and
citizens in Yemen."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Yemen is trying to change both its image and the underlying
culture, built up over centuries, that not only allowed radical Islam to
take hold here but also encouraged it. Under longtime President Ali
Abdullah Saleh, the government is trying to find and arrest suspected
operatives of the Al Qaeda terrorist network and discourage the
widespread affinity for extremist ideology.</TE>
<TE>   "Security, stability, civil peace and law and order are among the top
missions of this government," Prime Minister Abdul-Kadir Ba Jamal said at
a meeting of his Cabinet not long ago.</TE>
<TE>   At the forefront of the quest for those goals is the military. Yemeni
troops have detained more than two dozen suspected Al Qaeda operatives in
recent months. But this deeply impoverished country can do only so much
alone. So the president asked the United States to help--a request that
shocked Yemen's fiercely independent people.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody here is against sending American military troops to Yemen,"
said Fuad Salahi, a member of the faculty at Sana University who studies
the development of civil society. "People think it's another way to build
up their presence in the region."</TE>
<TE>   The United States already has advance forces in Yemen paving the way
for what is expected to be a relatively small contingent whose mission
will be to train Yemenis. Fewer than 100 troops are expected, according
to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has also been helping to draw up plans for developing a
Yemeni coast guard to protect the country's long, unpatrolled shoreline.
The operative word, though, is "helping," as the U.S. does not want to
offend Yemenis' sensibilities by suggesting deeper involvement in its
internal affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "On the security side, we will help the Yemenis," U.S. Ambassador
Edmund Hull said in an interview at his heavily fortified office on a
hill overlooking Sana, the capital. "We are not going to do it. We are
going to help them do it."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps as important, if Yemen is to succeed in altering a society in
which virtually every man has an automatic weapon, is economic
development. Yemen is the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula and,
outside sub-Saharan Africa, one of the least developed in the world.
Taking into account income, education and health, the United Nations
ranks it 133rd of 162 countries.</TE>
<TE>   But on this front, the U.S. has been far more circumspect. Although
Washington has sped up the dispatch of hundreds of millions of dollars in
aid to neighboring Egypt to prop up that country's ailing economy, it has
so far offered little in the way of substantial financial incentives to
Yemen. The Yemeni officials are not asking, at least not publicly, for
handouts. But they have made it clear that they will never succeed in
winning the hearts and minds of their people if they cannot at least
provide them with basic services such as running water and electricity,
which many rural communities must do without.</TE>
<TE>   "Fighting terrorism is very important first, for Yemen, for stability
for attracting investment," said Abdul Hadi H. Hamdani, an advisor to the
president. "We are fighting terrorism because it is our duty and it is
important to us."</TE>
<TE>   But he added: "People will not cooperate unless you give them the
necessities to live and a job. The most important thing is not to try to
control with soldiers but to convince the people by giving them what they
need, to start successful economic programs in the countryside."</TE>
<TE>   President Saleh's unambiguous anti-terrorism crusade, his alliance
with the United States and his willingness to use force have pushed
anti-American--and pro-Osama bin Laden--sentiment underground. Even the
messages at the mosques have been muted. Almost everyone on the streets
of this bustling if rundown city, as well as in isolated villages, claims
to be against terrorism and in favor of the U.S. effort to combat it. But
what Yemenis cannot accept is the idea of American troops on their soil.</TE>
<TE>   "We like it 100% that the U.S. and Yemen work together," said Mohammed
Ibrihim Embrah, 57, as he walked through the working-class neighborhood
of Shaoub in the old city. But, he said: "I don't like the idea of
bringing American troops to Yemen. It is not necessary to have American
troops here in Yemen. I want the USA to help against Israel."</TE>
<TE>Change Will Be Slow</TE>
<TE>   In a poor, trash-strewn area beside the Farowa market, where men buy
qat, the mildly stimulating leaf that Yemenis chew obsessively, crowds of
men echoed that refrain. Then Mohammed Mohsin, 24, elbowed his way to the
front of the crowd. His teeth lime-green from qat leaves, he said: "Osama
bin Laden is the top Muslim. The only one that faces America and Israel
is Osama bin Laden. Who else?"</TE>
<TE>   Many of Yemen's social, political and economic problems can hardly be
expected to be overcome solely in the context of the U.S.-led war on
terrorism. As recently as the 1960s, the country was so distrustful of
foreigners and so isolated that it closed the doors of the old city at
night, safeguarding the inhabitants of what looked like a medieval
fortress. Officials and experts here agree that change will have to come
slowly.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go back just 40 years, until 1961, there were no paved roads,
no secondary schools. The country was entirely cut off," said James
Rawley, the resident coordinator for the United Nations in Sana.</TE>
<TE>   But Yemen's current difficulties are also a function of modern-day
political maneuvering and of a leader's quest for power and control.
Saleh and his circle used Islam as a device to repel the spread of
communist ideology from the southern part of the country--much as the
United States used vengeful Muslims against the Soviet Union in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   When civil war broke out in 1994, the president allied himself with
thousands of Yemenis and other Arabs who had fought the Soviets in
Afghanistan. He eventually owed a debt of gratitude to these
fighters--many indoctrinated by groups that later fed into Al Qaeda and
Afghanistan's Taliban movement--for providing the backbone of his own
forces.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Yemen crushed the south in just 70 days, and many of the
fighters were brought into key government and military posts, officials
here say.</TE>
<TE>   After the threat of communism subsided, the president began
introducing institutions of democracy, holding elections, giving women
the right to vote and to serve in parliament, allowing a multi-party
system and permitting a relatively free press. This process of turning
away from his old allies accelerated after the Cole attack on Oct. 12,
2000, and then sped forward after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. is a very important country," said presidential advisor
Hamdani. "We need to strengthen our relationship with the U.S. We need to
cooperate."</TE>
<TE>   But these attitudes are not uniformly shared, on the streets or in the
upper reaches of government. Tariq Nasr Fadhli supported Saleh in his
battle against the south, and for that he was rewarded with several
posts. Fadhli could not be reached, but in comments made after Sept. 11
to the London-based pan-Arab newspaper Al Quds al Arabi, he spoke of his
deep devotion to Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "My relationship with Osama bin Laden is very good and very strong,
and I thank God for that," he was quoted as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Fadhli also spoke in the paper about the "Great Sheik" Bin Laden and
said, "May God protect him."</TE>

<HD>Tunnel Reopens After Deadly '99 Fire</HD>
<DH>Europe: Protesters vow to fight the return of exhaust-spewing
trucks to the Alpine link between France and Italy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHAMONIX, France
</DL>
<LD>The Mont Blanc tunnel linking France and Italy reopened to car
traffic Saturday, three years after a fire killed 39 people, but
protesters vowed to do all they could to block heavy-goods vehicles from
using it again.</LD>
<LD>   An explosion overnight wrecked a parked car on the French side of the
tunnel but caused no other damage. The tunnel is a key trade link, but
many residents and ecologists see it as a source of danger and pollution.</LD>
<LD>   Under heavy police surveillance, the first cars passed through the
tunnel just before 1 p.m. after a wreath-laying ceremony for the 39
victims of the blaze that engulfed the link in March 1999, forcing its
closure.</LD>
<TE>   The first motorist through the 7-mile-long tunnel under Western
Europe's highest mountain was a Greek man in a British-registered car
heading south to Corfu.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 protesters demonstrated on the French side against a
return of the thousands of trucks a day whose exhaust gases they say were
ruining the area before the accident.</TE>
<TE>   "When trucks start to come back, we won't be on the side of the road
anymore--we'll be in it," said Jean-Paul Trichet of the Assn. for the
Respect of the Mont Blanc Site.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of protesters demonstrated outside the mouth of the tunnel in
the Italian town of Courmayeur.</TE>
<TE>   Italy says the disruption to distribution routes caused by the closure
cost its economy $2.3 billion. European Commission President Romano
Prodi, an Italian, welcomed the reopening.</TE>
<TE>   The reopening of the 37-year-old link was not just good news for
business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great for us visiting Italy," said Brigitte Pirrone, who came
from southern France with her husband, Guy, for the opening. "We nearly
used the tunnel the day of the accident. The only reason we didn't was
because it was a nice day and my son wanted to go skiing."</TE>
<TE>   Others were not so lucky.</TE>
<TE>   Pasquali D'Amelio, standing by a monument to victims on the French
side, lost his 24-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a difficult day for me, but I've had lots of difficult days
since then," he said, accusing authorities of not doing enough to ensure
that such an accident won't happen again.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze began when a Belgian truck carrying flour and margarine
caught fire.</TE>
<TE>   An official report made 41 recommendations to improve safety.</TE>

<DL>BINDURA, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans braved intense heat and long
lines Saturday for a chance to vote in this southern African nation's
most contested presidential election.</LD>
<LD>   Masses of people stood in silence under the shade of hats and
umbrellas, or perched on camp chairs and stools. In some areas, the
queues snaked for miles along sun-drenched streets as polling places
accommodated fewer than 50 people an hour. At least 30 people were
reported injured in a township of Harare, the capital, when police fired
tear gas and rubber bullets at members of an irritated crowd who tried to
force their way into a polling place.</LD>
<LD>   Many polling places remained open past the scheduled 7 p.m. closing
time Saturday, and voting was set to continue for another day today. But
opposition politicians and local observers, voicing concern that time
could run out before all of the country's 5.6 million registered voters
could cast their ballots, were appealing for an extension of the polls.</LD>
<TE>Ruling Party Criticized</TE>
<TE>   The race pits incumbent President Robert Mugabe and his ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, or ZANU-PF, against
Morgan Tsvangirai, a onetime trade unionist and the leader of the
Movement for Democratic Change, or MDC. Mugabe has been president since
Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, attained independence from Britain in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Government critics charged Saturday that the slow pace of voting was
engineered, a last-ditch attempt by the ruling party to ensure that the
outcome would be in its favor.</TE>
<TE>   "The intention, of course, is that you frustrate as many voters as you
can," Tsvangirai told reporters as he went on a stroll in Harare. "Mugabe
is trying to move the goal posts to disenfranchise people, these people
he thinks will vote against him."</TE>
<TE>   Before the election, the government reduced the number of polling
places in urban areas, where the MDC dominates, and increased the number
in rural areas, which have traditionally been strongholds of the ruling
party.</TE>
<TE>   Learnmore Jongwe, a spokesman for the MDC, said Saturday that the
party had information that the government had instructed officials at
urban polling places to slow down the voting process. He added that the
opposition party's election observers had come under severe harassment
and that by midmorning, voting was proceeding without MDC representatives
in at least 52% of rural polling places.</TE>
<TE>   "We find this state of affairs completely unacceptable," Jongwe said.
"A people who have waited 22 years to vote for change cannot be denied
the opportunity to vote at the eleventh hour."</TE>
<TE>   However, political analysts and human rights activists said the
electoral process had been flawed long before Saturday because of
attempts to tip the balance in Mugabe's favor.</TE>
<TE>   "The elections can never be free and fair," said John Makumbe,
chairman of the Zimbabwe branch of Transparency International, a
corruption monitoring body. "The political playing field is not even."</TE>
<TE>   The election follows a campaign marred by violence, clashes and
systematic intimidation that rights groups and relief workers have blamed
largely on pro-government militants.</TE>
<TE>   The MDC says 107 of its supporters were killed in the two years
preceding Saturday's vote.</TE>
<TE>Mugabe's Moves</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe used presidential powers to reinstate special laws overturned
by the courts. Scores of opposition rallies were banned, and police were
granted the right to stop any public gathering. Criticizing the president
was criminalized, with freedom of the press in essence stifled.</TE>
<TE>   A January voter-registration deadline was extended to March 3 but with
no notification given to the opposition, which filed a last-minute
challenge seeking the removal from the rolls of the late-registered
voters. Only government agencies were allowed to offer voter education,
giving the ruling party ample opportunity to spread its propaganda and
disparage its foes.</TE>
<TE>   Observers from six of the 15 European Union nations were banned by the
government. Authorities also refused to accredit most of Zimbabwe's
independent monitors, many of whom showed up outside polling places
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   A former soldier heads the Electoral Supervisory Commission, and
government-appointed employees fill the group's ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Two days before the vote, the commission still refused to say how many
ballots had been printed or where polling places would be, leaving
inadequate time for the opposition to deploy monitors.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the controversy surrounding the electoral process, what
monitors there were said the first day of voting progressed in an
atmosphere of relative calm.</TE>
<TE>   In the farming town of Bindura, a traditional ruling party stronghold
about 40 miles north of Harare, voters flocked to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a chance in a lifetime," said Prosper Mutandadzi, 30, an
adult-education administrator. "You have to determine your future.
Actually, this day has taken too long to come. It's time for change."</TE>
<TE>   "The priority is restoring law and order in the country, as well as
improving the lives of Zimbabweans in general," said Wicklow Hwata, a
real estate agent in his 20s.</TE>
<TE>   The election comes amid a deepening economic crisis. Zimbabwe's
inflation has topped 110%, unemployment has surged to more than 60%, and
hunger is widespread.</TE>
<TE>   Tsvangirai, 49, is promising to revive the economy, alleviate the
government corruption that has been blamed for the country's financial
collapse and restore the rule of law.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe, 78, says he will create jobs and promote black empowerment by
continuing with a controversial land reform program based on seizing
white-owned farms for redistribution to landless blacks.</TE>
<TE>   That last pledge persuaded Annah Mubvumba to cast her vote for Mugabe.</TE>
<TE>   "Land is important, because many people have nowhere to stay," said
Mubvumba, 53. "We are suffering. We have no food to eat. We want the
land."</TE>

<HD>In Japan, Women Fight for the Last Word on Last Names</HD>
<DH>Culture: Conservatives resist legislative efforts to accommodate
female spouses who wish to keep their maiden surnames.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>Like many people, Mizuho Fukushima is quite attached to her
name--and wants to remain so. When she met her prospective husband,
Yuichi Kaido, more than 20 years ago, giving up her surname seemed like
killing an old friend.</LD>
<LD>   "It just didn't seem natural," she said.</LD>
<LD>   In another country, she could have kept her maiden name. Or both
partners could have used a hyphenated name. But in Japan, law dictates
that married partners share a single surname, and culture and tradition
ensure that it's the man's name 97% of the time.</LD>
<TE>   In the end, the couple registered their protest at the bureaucratic
inflexibility by not getting married. Over the ensuing two decades, which
included the birth of their daughter, Fukushima ratcheted up her fight,
writing several books on women's rights. Since becoming a lawmaker in
1998, she has fought for legislation to allow couples to have different
last names.</TE>
<TE>   Although Japanese increasingly side with Fukushima and other
supporters of dual names, conservative male lawmakers within the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party continue to resist changing the Civil Code.
Japan is alone among major developed nations and even among such
Confucian neighbors as China and South Korea in prohibiting dual
surnames.</TE>
<TE>   A poll last fall by the government Cabinet Office found that 65% of
respondents favored letting married couples keep separate last names, a
10-percentage-point jump from 1996 and the first time supporters
outweighed critics. Late last year, reformers even became hopeful for a
short time when the LDP agreed after years of opposition to consider the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   But traditionalists have roared back, arguing that allowing two-name
families will promote excessive individuality, encourage the complete
dissolution of the family and even create misunderstandings at mailboxes
and gravestones.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand it's inconvenient for working women to change their
surnames mid-career, but we should continue the existing system to avoid
confusion and to give a good example to children," said Sanae Takaichi,
an LDP lawmaker. "Dual surnames are not part of Japanese culture."</TE>
<TE>Old System at Issue</TE>
<TE>   Just look at the Scandinavian countries, where marriages break up
about 20% more frequently than in Japan, said Eiko Araki, director
general of the conservative Japan Women's Society. "It's obvious from
their high divorce rates that separate surnames loosen family ties."</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the debate is the several-centuries-old ie system, a
tradition that is getting weaker, particularly in cities, but still holds
a grip on parts of Japanese society. Under ie, a bride became part of the
man's house, took his name, cared for his mother and expected that her
ashes would be buried in his family tomb. So complete was the loss of
identity that even in cases in which wives were beaten or abused, their
own families frequently dared not intervene.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as though women were property owned by the husband's family,"
said Moriho Hirooka, a law professor at Chuo University in Tokyo.
"Wrapped up in this naming issue are some very old patriarchal
conventions."</TE>
<TE>   As more women have entered the work force, married later and attained
more prestigious jobs, the logic of this hidebound system has come under
greater scrutiny, even as the mismatch between real life and tradition
has produced an awkward patchwork of exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Wives are required to use their registered--that is, married--name on
driver's licenses, health insurance cards and residence permits. Ditto
for passports, although maiden names can be annotated if the wife can
prove she had a preexisting career that requires overseas travel.</TE>
<TE>   Architects, teachers, doctors, chemists, nurses and a host of other
licensed professionals must use their married name, even if their
professional reputation was built using a maiden name. Lawyers, court
clerks and accountants can use maiden names, as long as they also list
their registered names.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies allow married women to keep their maiden names; others
don't. And last year, bureaucrats were given the right to keep their
names, pending action by parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fukushima may be among the most vocal critics of the
single-surname system, many other women have fought quiet battles in the
shadows.</TE>
<TE>   Noriko Higuchi, a 42-year-old municipal worker in the northeastern
city of Sendai, has faced social stigma and marital tension over her
decision to use Higuchi, her maiden name, in all but the most official
situations during her 17 years of marriage.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, she says, her husband worried early on that she was on the
verge of divorcing him, even as his colleagues chided him for not being
able to control his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "If the separate-surname law passes, I'll rush down to the municipal
counter at 8:30 a.m. on the very first day to get my maiden name back,"
she said. "I miss it!"</TE>
<TE>   With 97% of married couples choosing the man's name, pressure on the
3% who defy tradition can be intense.</TE>
<TE>   Makoto Yamada, a 31-year-old dentist, took his wife's name when he
married Yuko Kuji several years ago. He says it seemed like a far more
interesting name than Yamada, which in Japan is akin to Jones or Smith.</TE>
<TE>   People quickly registered their disapproval--including his parents,
who had lived overseas and otherwise seemed quite liberal.</TE>
<TE>   "With their own son, however, they were very opposed to my taking her
name," he said. "And the arguments I heard were quite irrational: You
should keep your name because it's expected of you. You should do it
because your father will be embarrassed to tell your grandfather."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately the pressure became so great, linked implicitly to his
taking over the family dental practice, that the couple divorced--the
only way he could legally recover the Yamada name. They remain married in
all but name, he says, and the lack of legal ties has made them work
harder to secure the emotional ties.</TE>
<TE>Old Guard Blocks Plan</TE>
<TE>   The fight to change the law is not a new one. The idea was first
floated officially in 1991, draft legislation was introduced in 1996, and
the issue has been raised repeatedly by lawmakers since then.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, the favorable polls, a doubling during the last decade
in the number of female lawmakers to 74, including the justice minister,
and the political exit of a powerful LDP opponent over a payoff scandal
seemed to suggest change was possible.</TE>
<TE>   But resistance by the old guard was too great, and analysts now don't
expect a change before next year. The latest compromise under discussion
would allow dual surnames but label them "exceptions." Dual-name couples
would be allowed later to switch back to a single name, but those married
under a single name could not switch.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of change say opponents are mistaking cause and effect. In
the last decade, Japan's official divorce rate has doubled and its
child-abuse rate is 17 times what it once was. Supporters point out that
this is because of a range of economic, social and technological issues
seen around the world, not the result of the policy on names.</TE>
<TE>   "Decisions in Japan have long been made by old men" intent on seeing
women stay at home, Fukushima said. "To me, there's no single,
stereotypical family. It's a network of individuals who care for each
other."</TE>
<TE>   For Fukushima and Kaido, it took some courage to spurn tradition.
Their parents were aghast when they heard about the couple's decision not
to marry. Their daughter, now 15, was born out of wedlock, a status that
can subject parents and children to often-cruel social pressures.</TE>
<TE>   On the positive side, society gradually has become more accepting and
they have faced very little overt discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, we haven't run into too much direct prejudice,"
Fukushima said. "Maybe because both my partner and I are lawyers, no one
would dare."</TE>

<HD>An Iraqi Campaign Faces Many Hurdles</HD>
<DH>Mideast: If the U.S. opts for military action against Hussein, the
battle could prove to be America's toughest in decades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney's ambitious 11-nation swing through the
Middle East, which begins today, has as one of its critical goals lining
up a consensus on what to do about Iraq. But that doesn't mean the United
States will launch an operation to oust the regime of President Saddam
Hussein any time soon.</LD>
<LD>   The deeper the Bush administration gets into sorting through the
options, the more daunting the obstacles appear, U.S. officials concede.
A conventional military campaign, if that is the route adopted, could be
far more difficult than any U.S. operation in recent decades, including
the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</LD>
<LD>   The growing belief among experts is that any serious military campaign
would be difficult to launch before this fall, and perhaps not until much
later.</LD>
<TE>   "The level of difficulty and risk and the potential casualties will be
much higher and will require a lot more planning than either Afghanistan
or Operation Desert Storm," said Kenneth M. Pollack, a former National
Security Council staff member now at the Council on Foreign Relations, a
New York-based think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every angle of the prospective operation faces major
challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Militarily, because of downsizing since the Cold War, the U.S. has
only about half the number of divisions it did when it waged war against
Iraq in 1991--and it's still deeply involved in Afghanistan. The war in
Central Asia will have to wind down before the administration can launch
any serious campaign in the Gulf, analysts contend.</TE>
<TE>   The broader war on terrorism also will have to reach a stage in which
Washington feels confident that the major threat from the Al Qaeda
terrorist group and its allies is under control.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine if a terrorist attack occurred while the U.S. was focused on
Iraq," Pollack said. "People would crucify this administration and ask
why it didn't pay more attention to the folks in Al Qaeda rather than the
folks in Baghdad."</TE>
<TE>   The military also must resupply precision-guided munitions and other
war materiel rapidly being depleted in Afghanistan, a process likely to
take six to eight months, defense experts say.</TE>
<TE>   But the most difficult challenge will be what the administration sees
as a crucial preliminary step toward reducing the length and human cost
of a U.S.-led mission: trying to neutralize significant numbers of the
Iraqi military.</TE>
<TE>   "The big question is: Can the Iraqi military be reached in some way to
get them to defect or at least sit in their barracks? Is there a way to
get some of them to help us rather than hinder us?" said Whitley Bruner,
a former CIA officer in Iraq. "This has not been explored in any
systematic way."</TE>
<TE>   On the diplomatic front, Washington must carry through with two
ongoing efforts at the United Nations involving Iraq if it hopes to
prevent a major international backlash. A resolution on streamlining
current economic sanctions--in the hopes of increasing the flow of goods
to the Iraqi people while curtailing their government's ability to
acquire war materiel--is not expected to be voted on before June.</TE>
<TE>   The bigger variable is to get a team of weapons inspectors back into
the country, as President Bush has demanded. In the past, Hussein has
allowed inspectors in at the last minute to avoid military action against
his regime--then stalled in providing access to information and sites
suspected of being linked to weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The toughest assignment for the administration, however, could be
winning the support of other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the world has made clear its opposition to U.S. intervention
to oust Hussein. The administration's best hope, analysts say, is to
construct a "silent coalition" of countries willing to support the
operation privately, while persuading other nations to keep their
opposition to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   But even that lukewarm level of support could bear costs. Arab allies
are pressing for movement on the Palestinian-Israeli front before they
even discuss Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The old Mideast rule of thumb, that events on the ground overtake
diplomacy, has already altered Cheney's mission. Iraq was supposed to be
the main topic of his agenda, but that has been redefined by the
escalating bloodshed between Israelis and the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   All this while Afghanistan's future continues to consume the Bush
foreign policy team. The U.S. may need to help sort out the shattered
country's postwar period, as discordant ethnic and religious groups hold
a loya jirga, or grand council; write a new constitution; and create a
governing body to replace the interim administration. Any deterioration
or internal strife there could divert U.S. attention, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   On the political front, the administration would need to mobilize a
wide range of Iraqis to help manage a post-Hussein regime and ensure that
the U.S. did not have to micro-manage the aftermath for a long
period--something that would be unacceptable at home, in Iraq and in the
wider world.</TE>
<TE>Worries About Life After Hussein</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraq problem isn't solved simply by eliminating Saddam and his
family; you also have to find someone who will release people from living
under a regime of fear," said Judith Yaphe, a former intelligence analyst
now at the National Defense University in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   This step will be pivotal to winning support from the Arab world,
which is most nervous about the potential for internal chaos and regional
instability with Hussein gone.</TE>
<TE>   "People are far less interested in the mechanics of ousting him than
in what happens after Saddam," said Bruner, the former CIA officer. "And
this administration has not yet looked in a systematic way at what likely
scenario is best for creating stability. It doesn't want to occupy Iraq,
but it also doesn't want chaos as it backed the wrong horse."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Iraq's modern history is riddled with unstable coalitions, coups
and counter-coups until a strong leader emerged. And none of them has
been democratic.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's neighbors want the country of 22 million people to have a
strong central government, for it to avoid crumbling into its three
social groups: the Kurds in the north, the Shiite Muslims in the south
and the Sunni Muslims concentrated in the center and around the capital.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a real danger that strong tribal and other influences will
try to carve out zones of influence," Yaphe said. "The people of Iraq
have a complicated set of relationships that will dictate how long the
United States might have to stay--in just the kind of situation the
military doesn't like."</TE>
<TE>   The greater the U.S. role in shaping the post-Hussein period, the less
successful the aftermath is likely to be, according to Yaphe. "Our
choices may not be acceptable to most Iraqis," she said.</TE>
<TE>Potential for Regional Instability</TE>
<TE>   The issue is important because the impact of a regime change in Iraq
is far more extensive than in Afghanistan, Pollack said. If Afghanistan's
transformation collapsed, the country would become what it was before: a
broken state. But if Iraq collapsed, that could destabilize the entire
oil-rich Persian Gulf region, with a rippling impact around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It could become the Lebanon of the Gulf, with widespread impact on
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey, all countries we care about,"
Pollack said.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating this process will be the diverse visions Iraqis and their
neighbors have for post-Hussein rule.</TE>
<TE>   Economically, preparations are needed to keep oil markets from being
disrupted, especially as the world struggles to pull out of a recession,
analysts say. That requires an array of moves, from ensuring that other
countries will make up for any cutoff of Iraqi oil to deploying troops
quickly around the oil fields near the city of Kirkuk in the north and
near the Kuwaiti border in the south to prevent Hussein from ordering
their destruction, as he did in 1991 to Kuwait's fields.</TE>
<TE>   None of which takes into account the wild cards, such as the weather
in Iraq and politics back home.</TE>
<TE>   The scorching summer heat, particularly in the south, could affect
weapons systems and troops. Heavy rains that begin in mid-November could
slow armored vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   And with the approach of November's U.S. congressional elections,
neither major American party may want to see the early stages of a
military campaign weighing on voters' minds when control of both the
Senate and the House is up for grabs.</TE>

<HD>Russia Steps Up Chechnya Offensive</HD>
<DH>Caucasus: Two rebel leaders are killed during the military's latest
sweeps in the separatist republic, state media say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Russian troops hunted down rebels in Chechnya on Saturday in a
fresh series of "special operations," Russia's media reported.</LD>
<LD>   News agencies, quoting the military in the separatist southern region
of Russia, said government forces had killed 10 insurgents during several
days of the operations and detained more than 80 people accused of taking
part in or aiding rebel activities. Two senior rebel commanders were
killed, the media said.</LD>
<LD>   The operations were reportedly underway in a number of regions south
and east of Grozny, the Chechen capital--the mountainous terrain in which
rebels have flourished despite Russia's claim to control the entire
region.</LD>
<TE>   The offensive was launched in the middle of a three-day weekend
marking International Women's Day, one of the biggest public holidays in
Russia and other former Soviet states.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's top soldier in Chechnya, Lt. Gen. Vladimir Moltenskoi, told
NTV television that forces in the town of Stariye Atagi had killed rebel
commander Zelimkhan Sadayev, who was accused of killing service members
and civilians working with Russian authorities.</TE>
<TE>   NTV showed what Moltenskoi said was Sadayev's body on the ground, his
face covered with a sheet. Nearby was an array of seized weapons and
ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   Moltenskoi said Sadayev had been responsible for the deaths last month
of four officers of Russia's FSB domestic intelligence agency, which
oversees operations in Chechnya, and for killing civilians who worked
with Russian authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Television also showed Russian soldiers conducting a sweep in Grozny's
October district, questioning residents on a street and destroying
illegal oil refineries.</TE>
<TE>   The Interfax news agency said forces operating on the outskirts of
Urus-Martan had killed another prominent rebel leader.</TE>
<TE>   The last concerted series of Russian "special operations" was launched
in a period that extended through New Year's festivities. Authorities
said then that forces had killed 92 rebels, prompting the U.S. to accuse
Russia of using "overwhelming force" against the separatists, its first
such criticism of Moscow since Sept. 11.</TE>

<HD>Grenade Kills 4, Wounds 20 at Election Rally in Sri Lanka</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka
</DL>
<LD>A grenade exploded at an election rally of Sri Lanka's governing
party near this capital, killing at least four people and wounding 20
others, police and a party official said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Sri Lanka goes to the polls March 20-25 to elect provincial councils.
The election will also be a test of the popularity of the United National
Front, which won violence-plagued parliamentary elections Dec. 5.</LD>
<LD>   "Someone threw a grenade," Rajitha Senaratne, the government minister
for land reforms, said of the blast, which occurred late Friday. He said
he was told by rally organizers that at least four people were killed.</LD>
<TE>   A senior police official said 20 people were injured, three of them
seriously. The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no
arrests had been made. All the victims were supporters of the United
National Front.</TE>
<TE>   The front's main rival in the provincial council elections is
President Chandrika Kumaratunga's People's Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   In the parliamentary elections, the front won 129 of 225 seats. The
People's Alliance and its allies secured 96 seats.</TE>
<TE>   Elections in Sri Lanka are often violent. The December parliamentary
vote was the most violent ever, with 62 people killed and more than 300
wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Sri Lanka, an island off the tip of India, has been a parliamentary
democracy since winning independence from Britain in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1983, Sri Lanka has fought an insurgency with guerrillas who are
pressing for a separate homeland. The government signed a cease-fire with
the rebels last month, renewing hopes for peace. More than 64,000 people
have been killed in 18 years of terrorism and government retaliation.</TE>

<HD>A KFC Anti-Bucket Brigade</HD>
<DH>Manhattan: As real estate prices soar, shopkeepers are being edged
out by big chains such as the Colonel's.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>The windows of Sambas Deli are filled with Pop-Tarts and potato
chips, with roach killers and cold remedies. It's the kind of place
Manhattanites depend on--a cluttered, grab-bag of a store where you can
buy formula for a howling infant at 1 a.m. and hot coffee six hours
later.</LD>
<LD>   Gritty and functional, Sambas would hardly seem the site to wage a
battle over the future of Manhattan's Upper West Side. But when landlords
recently announced plans to end the deli's lease and replace the store
with a Kentucky Fried Chicken, they struck a nerve among residents who
have seen one too many chain stores take root on Broadway and drive out
local shops.</LD>
<LD>   "How much more of this can we take?" asked Arthur Ray, a longtime
customer, buying coffee from Awni Sambas, the Palestinian merchant who
has run the store since 1989. "They're turning us into franchise
central."</LD>
<TE>   Sambas grimaced, then rummaged through an ice cream freezer he may
soon have to sell. "I help the community. Who fights for me?"</TE>
<TE>   So far, more than 200 angry citizens have answered the call. Paul
Reese, a retired teacher who has lived in the area for 30 years, has
organized an online group of residents eager to fight the arrival of the
KFC on the corner of 106th Street and Broadway any way they can.</TE>
<TE>   "We always try to be good neighbors, and we will be," said Michael
Tierney, spokesman for Kentucky Fried Chicken. "There are lots of people
in New York who are eager to find [food] solutions to their busy lives."</TE>
<TE>   The tension between chain stores seeking prime locations and the
neighborhoods that resist them is hardly unique to Manhattan. With
varying results, similar wars have raged from coast to coast in
communities in transition.</TE>
<TE>   But the battle forming on the Upper West Side--an area running from
110th Street to 66th Street and from Riverside Drive to Central Park
West--is different. Until recently, this community has never been thought
of as a particularly hot retail or residential area.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the west side is primarily known as a place where people live,
far from the glitz and glamour of other Manhattan communities. It's
famous for a long history of progressive politics. Last year, after a
sustained battle, protesters living near Sambas Deli forced a CVS chain
drugstore on 102nd Street to close after it abruptly replaced a popular
supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   Residents are considering similar tactics for the KFC, which would
push out Sambas and a previously closed Spanish restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "People here are feeling their oats," said New York Assemblyman Edward
Sullivan, who represents the area. "The feeling is, we have a very
special environment here on the Upper West Side, and these new stores,
whether they are drugstores or fast-food outlets, don't always fit in."</TE>
<TE>   For decades, small, independent shops--none particularly
glamorous--have dominated the area. People never came here for three-star
dining or trendy fashion boutiques. Until the late 1980s, street crime
was a big problem.</TE>
<TE>   Filled with academics, retirees, Columbia University students and
working-class folks, the community had a messy, chaotic feel, very much
like the real-life Tom's Restaurant, where "Seinfeld" characters got
together.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents still cling to this lovable, schleppy image. In a
current ad touting the neighborhood, the weekly Westside Spirit ran the
photo of a gap-toothed, pigtailed girl and said: "Your daughter just did
an impression of a car alarm for show and tell," adding: "It's different
up here."</TE>
<TE>   But that difference began fading in the 1990s, when real estate values
on the Upper West Side--and in the rest of New York--started to soar. A
small two-bedroom condominium in the area that sold for $280,000 in 1992
would now command $800,000. Bidding on one-bedroom apartments starts at
$300,000.</TE>
<TE>   In less than 10 years, the west side became a magnet for upscale
families with children, a neighborhood no less desirable than the
affluent east side. And as the price of some apartments zoomed, reaching
millions of dollars, the value of commercial real estate on Broadway also
increased.</TE>
<TE>   Some landlords stood by longtime tenants, but others could not resist
the lure of more upscale clients. Why stick with the corner florist or
hair salon when you might double your rent if the Gap comes calling?
Property owners had a free hand, as New York has no commercial rent
control.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the west side has been invaded by a wave of chain
stores that would have been unthinkable before. Locally owned diners and
coffee shops now compete with a profusion of Starbucks. Small pharmacies
are battling a steady influx of chain drugstores. The few independent
bookshops that remain are locked in battles with two Barnes &amp; Noble
superstores.</TE>
<TE>   Today there are 11 chain drugstores on the 30 blocks of Broadway from
106th to 76th streets; the same area has five independently owned
pharmacies. The street has six Starbucks and three locally owned coffee
shops.</TE>
<TE>   These changes have distressed many. And while the Kentucky Fried
Chicken on 106th Street is nothing new--the latest restaurant would
replace an older, smaller outlet two blocks away--it represents a last
straw to those residents who see yet another valued neighborhood shop
disappearing.</TE>
<TE>   "You wake up and ask yourself: What's happening to the identity of
this community?" said Reese, who bemoans the passing of Sambas. "This
should be a neighborhood that meets local needs. Who needs another
fast-food store?"</TE>
<TE>   Awni Sambas tells a story that is familiar up and down Broadway. He
has paid $4,000 a month rent for more than 10 years and hoped to sign a
seven-year renewal. Instead, he said, the owner abruptly told him he was
going to cut the size of his store in half and raise the rent to $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   "They said take it or leave it, but I can't do business this way,"
Sambas said. Benjamin Huder, the landlord, did not return several calls
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The specter of small-business owners being squeezed out by higher
rents is one example of economic conflict, said Rick Dana, vice president
of Insignia Douglas Elliman, one of the city's largest real estate firms.
But sometimes shopkeepers are their own worst enemies, failing to pay
rent on time.</TE>
<TE>   "For every story about a greedy landlord on Broadway, there's a story
about a small-business owner who just can't make things work," Dana said.</TE>
<TE>   Sambas concedes he's had friction with his landlord over water bills
and has refused to pay rent until it's resolved. But he insists the
larger issue is whether the community needs his store or another
fast-food outlet.</TE>
<TE>   Unless Sambas pulls off a miracle (he has a court date this week to
try to block the termination of his lease), his shop will disappear. And
when it does, residents will add it to a lengthening list of stores now
departed.</TE>
<TE>   But miracles do occur. Last year, many here were stunned when
landlords terminated the lease of the Broadway Farm, a cluttered yet
friendly market that specialized in fresh fruit and vegetables. Anger
grew when people learned the store would be replaced by a big, pink
Victoria's Secret.</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by public support and media coverage, owners of the Broadway
Farm managed to lease a storefront across the street. Meanwhile,
activists threatened to boycott the new lingerie store, scrawling angry
graffiti on the plywood walls surrounding the neighborhood's newest
arrival.</TE>
<TE>   But across the street, there were different signs in empty storefront
windows welcoming back the Broadway Farm: "Hurry up and reopen!" they
read. "We'll all be seeing you soon!" and "We missed you."</TE>

<HD>'60s Radical Guilty in 2000 Murder, Could Face Death</HD>
<DH>Court: Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, known as H. Rap Brown in 1960s, is
convicted in fatal shooting of one deputy, wounding of other.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the 1960s black-power activist known as H.
Rap Brown, was convicted of murder Saturday in Atlanta in the shooting
death of a sheriff's deputy two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Al-Amin, 58, who changed his name when he converted to Islam while in
prison for robbery in the 1970s, was found guilty of 13 counts, including
murder, aggravated assault on a police officer, obstruction and
possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He faces the death penalty
when jurors reconvene Monday to consider his punishment for killing
Deputy Ricky Kinchen, who was gunned down while trying to serve an arrest
warrant. Another deputy was wounded in the incident. The jury, which
included nine blacks, deliberated 10 hours.</LD>
<LD>   The verdict came after a three-week trial, which had been postponed
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks because the judge feared anti-Muslim
sentiment would affect the sentiments of the jury pool.</LD>
<TE>   With his big, black sunglasses, bushy hair and fiery rhetoric, the
charismatic Brown became one of the symbols of the turbulent 1960s, an
angry son of the segregated South who believed that using violence as a
political tool was as "American as cherry pie."</TE>
<TE>   He seemed to undergo a radical transformation after becoming a Muslim
in the mid-1970s. Living in relative obscurity, he ran a small grocery in
Atlanta, was increasingly influential in the Islamic community and was
credited by neighbors with helping to reduce poverty, crime, drugs and
prostitution in his neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Amin's troubles with the law renewed in May 1999 when he was
charged with receiving stolen property, driving without proof of
insurance and impersonating a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   Ten months later, on March 16, 2000, two Fulton County deputy sheriffs
in Atlanta--Kinchen, 35, and Aldranon English, 28--stopped Al-Amin near
his grocery shop to serve him with a warrant for missing a court date.
Prosecutors said he opened fire on the officers with a high-power rifle
and a handgun.</TE>
<TE>   Kinchen was killed. English, who was wounded in his legs, left arm and
chest, identified Al-Amin from a photo. Four days later, Al-Amin was
arrested in White Hall, Ala., where he had once worked registering black
voters. FBI agents said ballistics tests on two guns they found in nearby
woods matched weapons used in the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   During his trial, the defense argued that Al-Amin was a victim of
ongoing harassment by law enforcement officers as a result of his more
radical days. They also pointed out that English said the shooter had
gray eyes and that he had wounded Al-Amin in the stomach during the
exchange of fire. Al-Amin has brown eyes and was not injured when
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Hubert Brown--the "Rap" nickname came during the 1960s--rose to
prominence as the man who succeeded Stokely Carmichael as the leader of
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. The group's more
conciliatory founders, such as Julian Bond, viewed Brown as more moderate
than the ousted leader. Carmichael disagreed, saying: "You'll be happy to
have me back when you hear from him. He's a bad man."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, a college dropout, was briefly on the FBI's 10 most wanted list
during the protest era. He was arrested in 1968 trying to board a plane
in Washington, D.C., carrying an M-1 rifle. In 1973, he was sentenced to
prison for robbery. Paroled in 1976, he made a pilgrimage to Mecca,
Islam's holy site, and began his social work in Atlanta, where he founded
the Community Mosque of Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Though his rhetoric softened, he continued to rail against perceived
injustices in the U.S. "When we begin to look critically at the
Constitution of the United States, we see that, in its main essence it is
diametrically opposed to what Allah has commanded," he wrote in 1994.</TE>

<LD>Catholics attending a Louisville conference examining issues of

<LD>   At least 550 people attended the Mass during the New Ways Ministry's

<LD>President Bush signed a long-sought economic stimulus package,
saying he hopes it will spur business investment and create jobs after
the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The compromise bill was passed Friday by Congress after months of
partisan gridlock. Three earlier House versions were blocked by Senate
Democrats who contended the tax breaks Bush originally sought for
corporations and wealthy individuals were excessive.</LD>
<LD>   The package extends regular 26-week unemployment benefits by 13 weeks
and allows additional automatic extensions in states with high
unemployment rates.</LD>

<HD>Texas Democrats' Hopes for Revival Rest With Sanchez, Latinos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO
</DL>
<LD>If demography is destiny, Latino businessman Tony Sanchez
represents the inevitable future of Democratic politics in Texas. The
question for Democrats is whether the future is now.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, the clear front-runner in Tuesday's primary for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination, is the key figure in the party's
strategy to restore its competitiveness in a state that has been
dominated by Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last 15 years, a relentless realignment of white voters in
rural and suburban areas toward the GOP has allowed Republicans to sweep
all of the major statewide offices and easily capture the state in
presidential elections. Pushed to the wall, Democrats have been hoping
that the inexorable increase in the state's Democratic-leaning Latino
population will slowly carry them back within reach of the GOP in the
nation's second largest state.</LD>
<TE>   Sanchez's bid to become Texas' first Latino gubernatorial nominee is a
bold effort to fast-forward that trajectory--an attempt to inspire a
quantum leap in Latino turnout that would bolster the party's prospects
up and down the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The Latino population growth means that "Texas is moving back toward
being a swing state over the next four to six years," said veteran Texas
political consultant Matthew Dowd, director of polling at the Republican
National Committee. "The question for Democrats is whether they can move
up six years into six months."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez is likely to cross his first hurdle Tuesday; he's a heavy
favorite to win an unexpectedly bitter primary over former state Atty.
Gen. Dan Morales, who Sanchez has outspent by more than 30 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   The winner will face off against Republican Gov. Rick Perry, the
lieutenant governor who ascended to the top job when George W. Bush left
Texas to become president.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sanchez was a candidate, he was a concept in the mind of
Democratic strategists, particularly former comptroller John Sharp. In
1998, Sharp narrowly lost the lieutenant governor's race to Perry; he
concluded that his GOP opponent had prevailed largely because Latino
turnout sagged without a Mexican American candidate on the Democratic
ticket.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Sharp encouraged Sanchez to seek the gubernatorial
nomination this year. Sanchez was familiar enough in Democratic circles
as a multimillionaire businessman from the Rio Grande Valley whose family
had made its money in energy, banking and a shrewd early investment in
the Blockbuster Inc. home video chain.</TE>
<TE>   But in some respects, Sanchez was an unusual choice. He's neither a
dynamic public presence nor a compelling speaker. At 59, he had no
experience in public office except for a stint on the University of Texas
Board of Regents. And he had been appointed to that job by Bush, who
Sanchez supported in both of his governor's races as well as his 2000
presidential bid.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp and other Democratic insiders were willing to look past those
issues because in other ways Sanchez seemed exactly what the beleaguered
party needed: a Latino who might excite Mexican American turnout; a
businessman who might reassure fiscally conservative voters; and perhaps
most important, a candidate wealthy enough to fund not only his own
campaign but also get-out-the-vote efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all of the party's leadership unified behind Sanchez. Then
Morales unexpectedly upset the coronation by jumping into the race just
hours before the filing deadline closed in January.</TE>
<TE>   A former state legislator from San Antonio and a two-term attorney
general, Morales had always been a maverick who operated without much
regard for the state Democratic hierarchy--particularly the Mexican
American leadership. In the primary campaign, Morales has progressed from
maverick to kamikaze. He's launched a withering assault on Sanchez that's
converted an unprecedented gubernatorial primary between two viable
Latino candidates into something very familiar here--a campaign that
looks like a bar fight.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they have understood the historical opportunity that
this race provides them," said Andrew Hernandez, a lecturer at St. Mary's
University in San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Morales has pounded Sanchez over the failure of a family-owned savings
and loan during the 1980s and a federal investigation that found Mexican
drug dealers had laundered $25 million through the institution. Sanchez
says he had no knowledge of the drug money deposits--though in at least
one case the S&amp;L sent an armored car to collect more than $5 million from
a plane landing at a private airfield--and no one from the institution
was ever charged with any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez has fired back with ads noting that Morales is under federal
investigation for his role in steering a generous slice of the settlement
money from the state's lawsuit against the major tobacco companies toward
an old friend who served as his legal advisor.</TE>
<TE>   In the campaign's final days, the struggle between the two has veered
into even more explosive and unanticipated terrain: the role of the
Spanish language, and Latinos more generally, in Texas life. Just before
the pair were scheduled to debate in English and then Spanish this month,
Morales announced he would translate his answers into English, because
English deserved to be treated as the state's dominant language.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Morales has daily accused Sanchez of trying to "divide
[Texas] by race, by ethnicity and by language."</TE>
<TE>   At an Austin appearance last week, Morales used language that might
have inspired protest marches if uttered by a white candidate, suggesting
that Sanchez had forgotten "this is a campaign for governor of Texas . .
. not . . . for governor of Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts believe Morales' strategy is unlikely to succeed. And
Sanchez is burying his opponent under television ads: Figures released
last week showed he had spent more than $18 million, almost all of it in
personal contributions or loans. Morales had spent $561,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Morales has thrown out some good material, but unless you can get it
on television, it's not going to penetrate," said Michael Baselice, the
pollster for Perry. "People just don't know the other side of Tony
Sanchez--yet."</TE>
<TE>   Responding to that inevitable advertising assault on his business
record will be one of the principal challenges for Sanchez if he wins the
nomination. The other will be increasing Latino turnout enough to get
within range of Perry.</TE>
<TE>   It was clear his candidacy is generating genuine pride among Latino
voters. When Sanchez visited a firehouse last week in San Antonio,
firefighter Juan Herrera--who once was forbidden from speaking Spanish on
the job--almost choked up imagining the prospect of a Latino governor.
"We've come a long ways," he said as several Latino colleagues nodded.
"To me a Hispanic governor . . . it would be like Martin Luther King
said: a dream."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, it will be daunting to turn out enough Latino voters to erase
the GOP advantage among whites. In the last two gubernatorial races,
Latinos have cast from 10% to 13% of the vote. Sanchez's strategists want
20%--which they believe, with strong African American support and about
one-third of the white vote, would allow them to beat Perry.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, the math works. But meeting that goal would require nearly
half of all Latino registered voters to participate in the election, said
Antonio Gonzalez, president of the William C. Velasquez Institute, a Los
Angeles-based group that studies Latino politics.</TE>
<TE>   To increase Latino turnout that much, Gonzalez said, "would require a
change in culture."</TE>
<TE>   Or a campaign that can successfully fast-forward history.</TE>

<HD>2 Maine Priests Removed After They Admit Sex Abuse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Maine
</DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic diocese removed two priests from their parishes
Saturday after they admitted to sexually abusing minors two decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   The priests will not be sent to other parishes, said Auxiliary Bishop
Michael Cote, second-in-command for the Portland diocese, which covers
the state. He spoke at the St. Agatha Parish in northern Maine, where one
priest had been serving.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement read to parishioners, Bishop Joseph Gerry wrote the
revelations of priest abuse "leave us all embarrassed, humiliated and
disheartened."</LD>
<TE>   As part of a recent policy on disclosing such cases, the diocese said
Feb. 10 that Fathers Michael Doucette and John Audibert had each sexually
abused a teenage boy. The cases began 22 and 26 years ago, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the diocese said it moved the priests to other parishes
because they had received treatment and evaluations that determined they
did not pose a threat to children.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter read Saturday, Gerry wrote that another allegation of
unwanted sexual advances was made against Doucette on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The diocese said it will remove all priests with a "credible"
allegation of sex abuse of a minor.</TE>

<HD>Yates' 5 Children Fought to Live, Doctor Testifies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Andrea Yates' five children died slowly, each struggling and
gasping for air as she drowned them one by one in the family bathtub, a
pediatric pathologist testified Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   It would have taken each child three minutes to lose consciousness,
and another three minutes to die, the pathologist said. In each case, he
said, Yates would have had time to resuscitate the child afterward but
didn't.</LD>
<LD>   "Each of these children did not want to die, and they fought their
deaths," Dr. Harry Wilson, a pathologist at Texas Tech University School
of Medicine, said while testifying for the prosecution during the third
week of testimony in Yates' capital murder trial.</LD>
<TE>   Yates, 37, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   Tears rolled down her face as she listened to Wilson describe her
children's fight for life.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson described the bruises on the children's bodies and used a
life-size infant doll to show how Yates pushed the forehead of her
youngest child, 6-month-old Mary, against the bottom of the bathtub.</TE>
<TE>   He said autopsies found bacteria in the children's lungs, which showed
they had inhaled vomit- and feces-riddled water in the tub as they were
being drowned.</TE>
<TE>   Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Mike Stephens testified that he heard
Yates tell a jail psychiatrist that she was stupid for not just killing
her 6-month-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Stephens said he overheard Yates tell Dr. Melissa Ferguson during an
interview at the jail that she knew her actions were wrong.</TE>
<TE>   During cross-examination, defense attorney George Parnham asked
Stephens if he eavesdropped on a private conversation between Yates and
Ferguson.</TE>
<TE>   No, Stephens said: "I just stood there and listened," eliciting laughs
from spectators.</TE>
<TE>   On June 20, after her husband left for work, Yates drowned all five
children in the tub, then called police and confessed. Officers found
Noah, 7, face down in the bathtub, and the bodies of John, 5, Paul, 3,
Luke, 2, and Mary under a wet sheet on a bed.</TE>
<TE>   Yates is being tried on two counts of capital murder, but could face
other charges later.</TE>

<HD>Scaffolding Falls 43 Floors, Killing 3 in Chicago</HD>

<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Scaffolding from the landmark John Hancock Center building fell on
a busy downtown street and crushed cars Saturday, killing three people
and critically injuring two, a fire department spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Unusually high winds were whipping through the area, but it was too
soon to say if they caused the 25 feet of scaffolding to fall from the
43rd floor, Fire Department Cmdr. Tim Stokes said.</LD>
<LD>   Krista Galaida, who was working in a flower shop on the first floor of
the Hancock building, said she heard what sounded like an explosion.</LD>
<TE>   "We just bolted; it was so loud and the ground shook," said Galaida.
"We thought a truck had come into the building or something. Everybody
thought it was a bomb."</TE>
<TE>   The scaffolding had been erected so crews, who weren't believed to be
working Saturday, could repair and clean the face of the building, Fire
Commissioner James Joyce said.</TE>
<TE>   Winds gusted up to 58 mph at a downtown airport around the time of the
collapse, according to the National Weather Service.</TE>
<TE>   Those killed were in three cars that were crushed by the debris,
Stokes said. Glass also rained down on the crowded streets.</TE>
<TE>   One woman was in critical condition and two others were in good
condition at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, administrator Shelley
Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   A 56-year-old woman was in critical condition with injuries that
included a broken femur and another woman was in fair condition at Cook
County Hospital, a hospital administrator said.</TE>
<TE>   A 56-year-old man was treated and released from Grant Hospital for an
injury to his right shoulder caused when he tried to help remove someone
from a car, a nursing supervisor said.</TE>
<TE>   The 100-story Hancock building, the city's third-tallest building,
anchors the north end of the city's busy Michigan Avenue shopping
district.</TE>
<TE>   Streets in the area were closed and traffic was rerouted.</TE>

<DL>BROOMFIELD, Colo.
</DL>
<LD>A woman who has acknowledged that she falsified records to help her
8-year-old son gain fame as a genius with an IQ test score of 298 has
admitted in court she created an "injurious environment" for her child.</LD>
<LD>   Elizabeth Chapman's admission came Friday in a dependency and neglect
case brought by Broomfield County, precluding a trial that had been
scheduled for March 18. The hearing in Broomfield District Court was
closed to the public, but the court issued a statement.</LD>
<LD>   Chapman declined to comment after the hearing. County child welfare
officials also would not comment.</LD>
<TE>   Chapman, 29, hospitalized her son Justin in November after what she
feared was a suicide attempt. Broomfield County removed the boy from her
care and charged her with neglect.</TE>
<TE>   She admitted she rigged his intelligence test results and that she
falsified other records.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Joining the capital's media elite Saturday for a night of revelry
and comic relief, President Bush turned serious long enough to urge
journalists to honor slain Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl by
writing letters to his soon-to-be-born son.</LD>
<LD>   Bush concluded the 117th annual Gridiron Club Dinner by also paying
tribute to U.S. soldiers who died recently in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   "May God bless the fallen soldiers who came home this week," he said.
"May God bless their families. May God bless Daniel Pearl and Mariane
Pearl and her boy and may the world he enters into be more peaceful than
the one his father just left."</LD>
<TE>   Pearl, South Asia bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal, was
abducted Jan. 23 in Karachi, Pakistan, and subsequently killed.</TE>
<TE>   Bush urged the journalists to write letters to the boy, send them to
the White House, and said he would add his own letter to Pearl's son and
make sure the family gets them.</TE>
<TE>   "You better than anyone know what Daniel Pearl was doing in
Afghanistan. You better than anyone can explain the larger purpose he was
serving. Some day you'll help a little boy understand his father a little
better, and what a great gift that would be."</TE>
<TE>   It was a somber ending to a brief speech that began with several jabs
at his top advisors, including Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Christie Whitman and Vice President Dick Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   He told the crowd that Whitman gave him one of his dogs "and I gave
her the EPA. Now we both have messes to clean up."</TE>
<TE>   Bush even joked about himself, noting that much has changed since the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. "A
year ago, Dick Cheney was running the country," Bush said. "Today, he
lives out of a little suitcase."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Whitman delivered the official response to a series of
journalist skits about the Bush administration, and poked fun at fellow
Republicans about their poor reputation on the environment.</TE>

<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Space shuttle Columbia's astronauts set the Hubble Space Telescope
free Saturday to behold the universe with sharper eyes and renewed
energy, ending NASA's most challenging service call.</LD>
<LD>   "Good luck, Mr. Hubble," John Grunsfeld, the chief repairman, said as
the telescope drifted off.</LD>
<LD>   Columbia's crane operator, Nancy Currie, released the observatory from
the end of the robot arm more than 360 miles above the Atlantic. The
shuttle backed away, providing the world with its last close-up look at
Hubble until astronauts return for another overhaul in two years.</LD>
<TE>   An hour later, flight controllers in Houston caught a glimpse of the
twinkling spacecraft.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very stirring sight to go out in the parking lot and to see
Columbia fly overhead with Hubble in trail," said Hubble program manager
Preston Burch.</TE>
<TE>   In a record-tying five spacewalks, Columbia's astronauts outfitted
Hubble with smaller but more powerful solar wings, a more robust central
power controller, a pointing mechanism, an advanced camera for peering
deeper than ever into the universe, and a super-cold refrigerator for
resuscitating a disabled infrared camera.</TE>
<TE>   More nerve-racking than any single repair--on any of the four
servicing missions--was the complete shutdown of the $2 billion-plus
telescope. It was the first blackout in Hubble's 12 years in orbit,
required for the power controller replacement. Everything came back on
when power was restored.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia's seven astronauts, who are due back on Earth on Tuesday,
fielded congratulations from their colleagues on Earth-- and from another
space voyager.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been following you along and sounds like you guys are batting
1,000%," international space station resident Daniel Bursch radioed.</TE>

<HD>'Shiver Surfers' Needn't Strive to Be Cool</HD>
<DH>Sport: Braving 40-degree temperatures and water that seems even
colder is the name of the game for this hardy group in the Pacific
Northwest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LUIS CABRERA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WESTPORT, Wash.
</DL>
<LD>Surfing the frigid wintertime waters off Washington's coast isn't
so tough, Brad Yaeger insists.</LD>
<LD>   Once he's zipped inside a maximum-thickness hooded wetsuit, paddling
out and beginning to ride the waves, he barely notices the 40-degree
water and icy surface winds.</LD>
<LD>   But then he remembers the ice-cream headaches.</LD>
<TE>   "You dive under a wave, and your head just goes 'Yeewww,' " he said,
bringing his hands together and squeezing. "It just whistles. It's like
you just ate a bunch of ice cream. It's really, really cold."</TE>
<TE>   Yaeger is one of the hardy dozens who each winter weekend strap their
boards to the tops of battered vans, station wagons and SUVs and drive
100 miles and more to Westport, a coastal fishing town that has become a
Mecca for cold-water surfing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's growing fast," said Rob Brown, a surfboard-maker and coffee-shop
owner who staged Westport's first Clean Water Classic, a competition that
attracted men and women from southern Oregon to British Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   "What it is," he said, "is all the snowboarders and skaters from
Seattle and Vancouver, Canada, are crossing over to the mother of all
those sports."</TE>
<TE>   And they're finding popular spots, even as far north as off the west
coast of Vancouver Island and Yakutat in southeast Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   The Westport contest was staged one weekend in mid-February when the
temperature was in the low 40s--though the wind and rain made it feel
colder. The competition, with a $500 top prize, captured the essence of
the Pacific Northwest surfing scene.</TE>
<TE>   Parkas, ponchos and thick knit caps were the gear of choice for 50 or
so spectators who scrambled up piles of treacherous, slime-covered
boulders and shivered for hours in drizzle broken only occasionally by
sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sunny day for us. But the waves are best in winter, when
it's like this," said Mike McCann, a 27-year-old Seattle schoolteacher
and avid Westport surfer who drove down to watch.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Dana Monson, 32, drove from Sun Valley, Idaho, to catch the
action and connect with friends from her days as a Westport surfer.</TE>
<TE>   "I started when I was 26," she said. "I moved out here and lived in my
van for three months and learned to surf."</TE>
<TE>   Monson, who had moved to the coast from Tacoma, said she had known
Westport winters would be wet and cold, but she hadn't known what real
cold felt like until she took up surfing.</TE>
<TE>   Getting out of a wetsuit after an hour or so in the water is so cold,
she said, "sometimes you feel as if your thumb is going to break off
because it's completely numb, and you can't get your booties off."</TE>
<TE>   Monson, like most other Westport surfers, has ridden waves in such
warm-water locales as Southern California, Hawaii and Costa Rica. But she
continues to take a week's vacation every fall and spring to surf at
Westport.</TE>
<TE>   And she is not alone.</TE>
<TE>   Nine-year-old Alexandra Papac of Seattle shivered in her wetsuit as
she clambered over the barrier boulders after completing her run as the
only entrant in the Menahune, or kids, division.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not bad until you get hit by your first wave, and then it's
really, really cold," she said.</TE>
<TE>   LeBaron Esty, 49, manager of the Surf Shop in Westport, said, "There
was just a handful of people when I came up here 20 years ago, and it
seemed like heaven to me coming from a crowded surf spot like Santa Cruz,
Calif.</TE>
<TE>   "You had beautiful waves, beautiful people. There was a real pioneer
spirit of surfing where everybody helped each other and everybody was
excited to see each other," he said. "It grew exponentially over the
years."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the few dozen surfers who might be seen testing the
waves in February have become a few hundred during the summer weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they still have to wear wetsuits.</TE>
<TE>   In winter, that means full-body, hooded neoprene suits that can be up
to 5 millimeters thick. Manufacturers may use different materials to seal
seams, or they use Velcro instead of zippers.</TE>
<TE>   "In California, they're just into fashion, while the surfers in the
Northwest are more practical," Brown said. "It's a bit of the Northwest
grunge. They don't care what they look like. They just want the best
equipment they can get--and the best wetsuit. You definitely have to have
a good wetsuit."</TE>
<TE>   Surfers in Westport consider themselves more serious about their sport
than California surfers.</TE>
<TE>   "People up here are surfing for surfing's sake, as opposed to
scamming-the-chick-on-the-beach sake," said Frank Crippen, who owns NxNW
Surf Co. in Port Angeles, located farther up the coast and a right turn
into the Strait of Juan de Fuca.</TE>
<TE>   In that area, the best surfing spots are a tightly guarded secret.
Many of them are on private land or in remote, relatively fragile areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody blabbed about a year-and-a-half ago, and he got
blacklisted," Yaeger said, adding that the surfer's picture, license
plate number and other information were posted on a Web site. "You were
supposed to just give him a hard time."</TE>
<TE>   In Westport, the three best surfing spots are within a couple of miles
of town. Far from being secret, they've become a local industry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's done the town really good in many ways," said Esty's ex-wife,
Debby, who was perched on a boulder, watching her son, LeBaron III,
compete.</TE>
<TE>   "The fishing industry has always been the main provider in this area,
and it still is, but it's dying to a point. This brings a different type
of person in--the surfers with young families."</TE>
<TE>   She fondly recalled rearing her family around surfing, with beach
bonfires and large gatherings, even in midwinter.</TE>
<TE>   "There'd be snow all over the beach and they would be out there
surfing," she said. "I'd keep hot water by the fire, so when they'd come
in they'd dump it on themselves so they wouldn't get hypothermia. Then
they'd go back out again. They were nuts, but I loved being on the beach
watching it."</TE>

<LD>   The finding suggests that because the threatened species wanders
thousands of miles to breed, government-sponsored programs to reintroduce
it in western states do not have to rely on capturing animals with
specific bloodlines to successfully repopulate an area.</LD>
<LD>   Genetic evidence analyzed at the University of Montana suggests that
every 10 years or so, lynx from as far away as northern Alaska tend to
breed throughout the Canadian Rockies and into the northwestern United
States.</LD>
<TE>   Previously, scientists were split over the belief that lynx
populations did not widely mix and were highly adapted to local
environments.</TE>
<TE>   The lynx study appeared in the Jan. 31 issue of the journal Nature.</TE>
<TE>   "A lynx is a lynx is a lynx," said University of Wyoming biologist
Steven Buskirk, who did not participate in the study. "They are very
similar across their geographical range."</TE>
<TE>   In the study, the Montana researchers mapped lynx populations from
northern Alaska through western Canada and into Montana and Washington
state.</TE>
<TE>   Genetic analysis of lynx from 17 collection sites showed the animals
did not vary significantly over distances up to 1,860 miles apart.</TE>
<TE>   Radio tracking showed lynx regularly travel hundreds of miles to hunt
and breed, often across glaciers and other forbidding natural barriers.
They tend to roam even more than bears, wolves or coyotes, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers recommend that conservation efforts focus on
preventing roads and development from pinching off the wild corridors
that the lynx use to wander.</TE>
<TE>   "Gene flow for the lynx is the highest yet found for any carnivore,"
said the study's lead author, Michael Schwartz. "Joint international
efforts should be initiated to ensure that connectivity between northern
and southern lynx populations is sustained."</TE>
<TE>   However, the finding doesn't mean that lynx populations will recover
after decades of trapping and poisoning programs.</TE>
<TE>   In distant locations, such as Alaska's Kenai peninsula, genetic
testing showed only four lynx in a generation had managed to arrive from
elsewhere to breed.</TE>
<TE>   "The study clearly shows the importance of maintaining dispersal
corridors that these wide-ranging carnivores can use," Buskirk said. "If
you assume a new generation of lynx every three or four years, those four
animals that arrived will leave their genetic signature. But it doesn't
mean they will make a big impact on the population size in the area."</TE>
<TE>   For the past three years, government agencies have been releasing
captured Canadian lynx in the Colorado Rockies, the southernmost reaches
of the wildcat's historic range.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, four of the first five lynx released in the San Juan
Mountains starved to death. Since then, biologists have been more
successful by fattening dozens of the animals for several weeks in
captivity before releasing them in the winter when prey is more
available.</TE>
<TE>   The federal reintroduction program has been criticized by some Western
lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, seven biologists planted samples of lynx fur in two national
forests to test whether laboratories could properly identify it. The
lawmakers charged that the biologists might have been trying to skew the
study in favor of reintroduction and limiting commercial activities in
the area. The biologists have since been reassigned or retired.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the General Accounting Office found that the
biologists knew they were breaking the rules but that the bogus samples
were weeded out and did not affect the survey results.</TE>

<HD>Astronomers See the Light--And Really Hate It</HD>
<DH>Science: Because of 'pollution' from street lamps and other
sources, the night sky isn't what it used to be, restricting visibility
for researchers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT THOMSEN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX
</DL>
<LD>Drive through the Arizona desert on a clear night and the heavens
open above you.</LD>
<LD>   Orion, the Pleiades, the edge of the Milky Way and more fill the sky's
black canopy. It gives pause to hikers, sets a romantic backdrop for
lovers and allows scientists to gaze into the far reaches of the
universe.</LD>
<LD>   Until you get near a city, that is, where artificial light from street
lamps, spotlights and neon signs overwhelms the faint dots twinkling
above.</LD>
<TE>   Astronomers call it light pollution. They also call it a threat to the
research and technology spinoffs that pump nearly $1 billion into
Arizona's economy each year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're losing a huge amount of the universe," said Chris Corbally, a
Tucson astronomer studying the spectrum of starlight to learn what stars
are made of, what they burn and what surrounds them.</TE>
<TE>   The spread of light pollution is a consequence of Arizona's rapid
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Maricopa County is one of the nation's fastest-growing counties. The 4
million people who live in the greater Phoenix area use enough light to
hide many stars and affect research at observatories as far away as
Flagstaff, 116 miles to the north.</TE>
<TE>   Even light from small towns can hurt, if the communities are close
enough to a telescope.</TE>
<TE>   "It's compounded enormously when you go at it with a telescope because
it's so much more sensitive," Corbally said. "We can still do good stuff,
but at some stage it will become alarming."</TE>
<TE>   This year, the concerns about the light pollution have reached the
Legislature, where state lawmakers are considering two proposals that
seek to limit or reduce the man-made glare.</TE>
<TE>   A bill sponsored by state Sen. Darden Hamilton would require street
lights to be shielded to reduce light pollution while still illuminating
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Another sponsored by state Rep. Jeff Hatch-Miller would require any
city or town with a population of more than 50,000 to adopt an ordinance
regulating outdoor lighting by 2004 and to reduce light levels 10% by
2006.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have reason to worry, because any negative effects on
research could have repercussions for the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Astronomy projects at Lowell Observatory and the U.S. Naval
Observatory in Flagstaff; Kitt Peak southwest of Tucson; Mt. Hopkins
north of Nogales; and Mt. Graham near Safford employ about 1,000
scientists and support staff.</TE>
<TE>   The latest addition is an $87-million binocular telescope that the
University of Arizona is building on Mt. Graham. It is being built with
twin 8.4-meter mirrors and will be the largest of its kind in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Astronomy spinoffs in missile defense programs, optics and other
technologies add thousands more high-paid workers and hundreds of
millions of dollars to the state's economy.</TE>
<TE>   These are high-paying jobs in clean industries and they are here
because Arizona is one of the few places in the country with dark skies.</TE>
<TE>   A study released last fall by scientists from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and the Universita di Padova in Italy found
that about two-thirds of the global population lives under skies marred
by a flood of artificial light.</TE>
<TE>   The glow is so bright and covers so much ground that one in five
people worldwide cannot see the bright band of the Milky Way, according
to the study.</TE>
<TE>   "I was an astronomy student at U of A 30 years ago when we talked
about light pollution," state Sen. Ruth Solomon said. "We called it lack
of seeing ability, and it's gotten much worse. If you just look at the
night sky with the naked eye, you can't even pick out the Pleiades
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Solomon said Tucson's emergence as a leading optics center is due to
the presence of Kitt Peak and the university's pioneering work in
astronomy, mirror-casting and related technologies. But if Arizona does
not protect its dark skies from light pollution, astronomers and the
associated industries will go elsewhere, such as Hawaii, Chile or beyond,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hatch-Miller said bright city lights also damage the desert's appeal
to tourists and waste energy.</TE>
<TE>   "The concept of having a dark sky is part of our natural endowment. It
was part of what you got when you went into the desert," Hatch-Miller
said. "We've been losing that."</TE>
<TE>   "About 50% of the glow we see in the night is wasted energy,"
Hatch-Miller said. "It doesn't do anything for safety, driving or keeping
offices open. It's just wasted. If we use less energy because we use it
more wisely, that's just to our advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Reducing light pollution does not have to be onerous or expensive,
Corbally said.</TE>
<TE>   Shielding lamps and changing outdoor lights from mercury vapor bulbs
to sodium-based lighting are simple steps that can help preserve
Arizona's dark night skies, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something that people think about," Corbally said. "Once
they think about it, it's something they say, 'Oh yeah, of course.' "</TE>
<TE>   "This is a resource," he said. "We've got it. Let's not be so dumb as
to throw it away."</TE>

<LD>The voters have spoken decisively on El Toro on two fronts. Yes, it
is regrettable that the county blew the opportunity to plan some kind
of acceptable aviation facility. But with a rezoning of the closed
Marine base for a park and also the collapse of the pro-airport
majority on the Board of Supervisors, the question is not whether
there will be a change of direction, but exactly what it will look
like. Within hours of the vote there was a new wrinkle. The federal
government, tired of the long process, stepped up to say that it will
now auction the land.</LD>
<LD>   The feds hold the cards, but auctioning the land in a way that
fulfills the Measure W mandate is not necessarily a sure bet to
attract developers, at least for the park portion of the land. This
might be an invitation to have nothing happen at El Toro for years
but weeds and cracked concrete on that part of the base, which would
be an outcome many observers have predicted for some time anyway. It
also will be a challenge both to keep faith with the park initiative
and to break the land up for a series of private sales, although
obviously portions of this land will be very attractive to somebody,
provided they are cleaned up and usable.</LD>
<TE>   If the federal government were not so antsy to unload bases and
put money in its coffers, the natural course would be to do what we
suggested two years ago: Reconstitute the local planning authority
for the base. That is, after all, the method originally outlined by
the federal government for returning closed facilities to civilian
use. The advantage is that it enlists local communities directly in
choosing what they will have, but now an impatient federal government
is saying in effect that it would transfer land for free only for one
use: an airport.</TE>
<TE>   But with a private sale, Irvine arguably still could have an
annexation or at least influence what happens at the site. As a
practical matter, the current Local Redevelopment Authority, which is
a county-only operation and was airport driven, is dead.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the question of more legal wrangling, which a
private sale might circumvent by defusing the old Irvine-Newport
Beach airport wars. Putting the land on the block might be more
acceptable to Newport Beach now that it has its protections in place
for the future of John Wayne Airport.</TE>
<TE>   At least this much is clear: Through eight years of debate and
four rounds of ballot initiatives, one has never been able to say
with certainty the words "Closure is at hand" about the future of El
Toro. And it is true that on election night, a spokeswoman for the
Newport Beach-based Airport Working Group cited past legal success in
overturning a previous anti-airport initiative, and suggested more
litigation is ahead. But as decisively as can be said at any time so
far, the results of Tuesday's initiative to rezone the base for a
park--and the subsequent announcement by the Navy--have driven a
spike through the heart of the commercial airport.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly the county needs to move forward while continuing to
look after the interests of Newport Beach, which fears being burdened
with an oversized airport. It is worth looking back at what
immediately preceded Measure W in the procession of initiatives. The
overwhelming passage of Measure F in 2000 was an indication of the
hardening of community thinking about the county's planning for the
base. At that time, airport opponents crafted an initiative that
passed overwhelmingly and sought to remove from local county
officials the final say over decision-making on major public
infrastructure projects.</TE>
<TE>   The courts later found that the initiative impinged on the
prerogatives reserved for local elected officials, in effect making
it impossible for them to do their jobs with the threat of
referendums hanging over their heads. But having the courts step in
to restore procedural order did nothing to remedy the underlying
frustration of local residents over the arrogance of local planners
in crafting an airport plan that was too big and raised so many
questions about safety and the environment. The polling at the time
on how residents in Orange County perceived their county leadership
suggested a wide gap in confidence between constituents and leaders.
That aspect of flagging confidence in the supervisors came home to
roost Tuesday when voters in a North County district replaced
incumbent Cynthia P. Coad with Chris Norby.</TE>
<TE>   On a thin margin of support for the commercial airport on the
Board of Supervisors, the county pressed forward with a plan that
lacked any real support in communities surrounding El Toro, and had a
soft base throughout the county. The argument for Measure A in 1994
to zone the base for an airport had been made as a way to preserve an
option. However, once that initiative passed narrowly, airport
advocates acted as if nobody else had any standing in the base reuse
process, and that other options had been rejected. Thus began an
institutionalized process of alienation of local communities from the
reuse planning.</TE>
<TE>   A decision in Washington to sell the land has a finality to it
that transcends all the local fighting that has gone on. What
happened last week argues for moving on, not reopening old
jurisdictional battles. A private sale at this point would at least
be an alternative to more local wrangling.</TE>
<TE>   We said before the vote that the county needed to make provisions
for the probability that John Wayne would have to meet the county's
future aviation needs alone. It now appears more likely than ever
that John Wayne represents the future, and that a carefully expanded
facility will have to work in concert with other regional airports to
meet future needs. Orange County's projected growth is nothing like
that of other counties in Southern California, but it does need to
make provisions for growth. Shortly before last week's balloting, the
county agreed to extend caps in a way that would permit some growth
at John Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, clarity makes progress possible. After years of
uncertainty, the El Toro picture at least has come more sharply into
focus.</TE>

<LD>Re "Judge Accused of Sex Offenses Could Face Runoff," March 6:</LD>
<LD>   Today The Times reported that a Fullerton voter was disappointed
that he didn't know of the criminal charges against Judge Ronald C.
Kline until after he voted. He thought there should have been "a lot
more publicity" about Kline's arrest.</LD>
<LD>   The judge's arrest had been extensively covered on all local TV
newscasts, in both The Times and its Orange County competitor, and on
all local radio news.</LD>
<TE>   The write-ins who came forward to contest this election placed
more than a dozen fliers in my mailbox and under my windshield wipers
at shopping malls. I found it very hard to avoid all the publicity,
and it wasn't difficult at all to choose a write-in. Somewhere along
the line isn't it a responsibility to educate oneself just a little
bit before going into the voting booth? Next time, those who don't
bother to learn anything about the election should do the rest of us
a favor. Please don't bother to vote at all.</TE>

<TE>   Judge Kline is now facing a runoff election. At midnight he was
still leading, but when other apparently larger districts came in,
his lead was hammered. Now Orange County must determine who Kline is
going to run against. Thanks for the help in ensuring that Gay
Sandoval or another highly qualified candidate will run against the
"good" judge.</TE>

<TE>   I found one portion of your article most disheartening. A person
interviewed after casting his ballot said he learned about the
charges against Judge Kline only after he voted, and said, "I'm
surprised his name was still on the ballot. You would think with
something like this there would be a lot more publicity."</TE>
<TE>   Just how much publicity is enough? The Times and Register ran
numerous articles about the situation, and it was covered on local TV
news. Does the person interviewed read a newspaper? Does he watch
anything but Letterman on TV? If a democracy is to work, voters have
a responsibility to inform themselves on the issues.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the gentleman quoted is not alone. My wife is a
schoolteacher in an affluent district, and she is amazed at how few
of her students live in a home that subscribes to a newspaper.
Ultimately, we get the government we deserve.</TE>

<TE>   I am so angry I could spit nails. When reaching my polling place
to vote last evening, I was given a few ballots only on the measures.
I told them I was a registered Democrat and asked them for a
Democratic ballot. They showed me I was in their books as a
nonpartisan registrar. I have been a registered Democratic voter all
of my life except for a couple years in the 1980s, when I was
registered as a libertarian.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, I was never notified of the Supreme Court's ruling that
California's open primary had been ruled unconstitutional, and my
first knowledge of it was on Page 3 in the voter pamphlet. I am an
avid listener to the news and read several newspapers on the Web. I
believe I am above the norm when it comes to keeping myself informed
of current events and world news.</TE>
<TE>   I was so dejected I couldn't vote. I came home and checked the
Orange County registrar's Web page. There was nothing stating that
voters should be notified of the closed primary or what that would
mean to all registered voters and nonregistered voters. It appears
that it certainly was neglect, or was it intentional? Isn't this
irresponsible when political parties are calling for strong voter
turnouts?</TE>
<TE>   I hope there is some investigative reporting and follow-up on how
many more voters and counties in California have been manipulated. Is
this how elections in this country are going to take place now?</TE>

<TE>   Re "In Jolt to O.C., Navy to Sell Off El Toro Land," March 7:</TE>
<TE>   Now we get the dirty lowdown: the truth. Democracy, hah. We never
had a choice. El Toro was slated to become an airport or a
development regardless of the illusion of democracy. The movers and
shakers and their shills proved once again that Orange County is a
disgrace to the concept of democracy. This is a banana republic.

El Toro as an international airport has released that 4,700 acres and
the approximately 14,000 acres previously held as a sound buffer
where most building was prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   It will now be possible to build more houses and golf courses that
were not previously imaginable in this central Orange County
location. Looks like about 25,000 houses and two golf courses.</TE>
<TE>   What an economic boon for Orange County. I'm sure to most people
that this is an unintended consequence.</TE>

<TE>   The defeat of the El Toro airport proposal again shows that you

<TE>   Lie 1: Landings to the north and takeoffs to the east--with
crossing runways, prevailing winds from the southwest, John Wayne's
routine final approach in the middle of it all, and a forced turn to
avoid the mountains to the east.</TE>
<TE>   Lie 2: No one talked about the additional truck traffic in the
area. The barrage of air freight and other trucks would stress the El
Toro Y traffic congestion beyond the breaking point. Everyone loses
if we gridlock what is already a bottleneck.</TE>
<TE>   What we need is a real airport plan for Orange County. Guess what?
San Diego has a serious airport problem too. The obvious solution,
our great respect for the Marine Corps notwithstanding, is to build a
modern new international airport on part of the property at Camp
Pendleton. Why not, unless politicians are not able to work together,
across jurisdictions, for the common good?</TE>

<TE>   An item that has not received much notice when considering what to
do with El Toro is the contamination that surely is present at the
base. Bases such as El Toro are typically so contaminated with
solvents and heavy metals that the hazardous waste is kept. Rather
than transporting hazardous waste because of safety, environmental
and cost concerns to a better burial ground, the waste is covered
with a cap and left in place.</TE>
<TE>   Does the top of such a cap sound like an appropriate place for the
Great Park? Either the waste must be removed, which is unlikely and
would involve millions of dollars, or the waste is covered with a
cap. Both scenarios would involve costs associated with regulatory
bureaucracies and litigation.</TE>
<TE>   So, whatever happens to El Toro must be related to an industrial
use. Children cannot play on top of such a cap.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Social Security Is Still Secure," Commentary, March 3:</LD>
<LD>   Your article on Social Security shows a heartening concern that
this important issue remains on the agenda. However, it merits
certain corrections.</LD>
<LD>   Kenneth L. Perry of Newport Beach writes that Social Security
should be a collective fund into which all pay and that all would
suffer benefit cuts when the fund runs out. That is the case today:
Practically all Americans, including elected officials, pay into
Social Security, and under law when the trust fund runs out in 2038
all retirees will suffer a 28% reduction in benefits.</LD>
<TE>   Connie Haddad's article exhibits more difficulties. Haddad argues
that Social Security's trust fund is real because it contains real
government debt; but no one argued otherwise. However, unlike a
private sector fund, the trust fund cannot put off tax increases by a
day or a dollar because taxes must be increased to repay the Treasury
bonds in the fund. Moreover, while the fund's debt is legal, nothing
prevents Congress from reducing benefits if the burden of repaying
that debt is too great. Given the massive size of debt service
payments, it is a surety that benefits would be trimmed before 2038,
fund or no fund.</TE>
<TE>   Haddad also mischaracterizes reforms based on personal accounts.
Under proposals from the president's commission, Americans over age
55 would see absolutely no changes to their benefits or
cost-of-living adjustments. Younger workers could choose to invest
part of their payroll taxes in personal accounts, part of which might
be invested in broadly diversified stock index funds. An Enron-type
debacle would be impossible, as workers could not invest in
individual stocks as Enron employees did.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Haddad claims the president's commission failed to come
up with a viable plan to cover the cost of transitioning to personal
accounts. That is incorrect; all of the commission's plans would cost
less than maintaining the current system, in one case fully 68% less,
while paying higher benefits to the low-wage retirees who need them
most. Whatever the costs of personal accounts, they are far smaller
over the long run than the insolvent status quo.</TE>

<TE>   Connie Haddad's article was a bright light among a lot of dim
bulbs that too often get the media attention. This may to some degree
be because we are not a nation of rational numbers crunchers. At any
rate, arithmetical garbage seems to get top billing most of the time.
We need more Connies.</TE>

<HD>Learning Truancy's Lessons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps the only one who may dislike being made to sit in school more
than a habitual truant is the truant's parent. But that's where one
father recently found himself after a judge ordered him there. He
should consider himself fortunate to have sat in his son's classroom
that day. It could have been a jail cell.</LD>
<LD>   It's all part of the county crackdown that has put teeth in
long-standing truancy laws, rarely enforced because of a lack of
funds and personnel.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to more than $200,000 in state and federal grants to Orange
County, the money and enforcement help now match the desire of school
and law enforcement officials to attack the problem and get errant
youngsters back in school.</LD>
<TE>   Three deputy district attorneys have been assigned to the program.
They are tracking the attendance records of hundreds of students
throughout the county for possible legal action. Truancy is defined
in the state Education Code as three or more unexcused absences in a
school year. Habitual truancy is six or more unexcused absences.</TE>
<TE>   While prosecutors are searching for truants, school officials and
social workers must be equally zealous in seeking out the causes and
solutions that could make the strong enforcement effort unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the importance of keeping children in school, parents
should strongly support the effort. If they need other motivation,
such support also could help keep the parent out of court and
possibly jail. Parents found negligent in meeting their legal
responsibility to be sure that their child attends school could be
charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</TE>
<TE>   The approach is not entirely new. School and law enforcement
officials began stronger enforcement of habitual truants in the early
1990s. Police then would ticket unsupervised juveniles found roaming
the streets during school hours. The citation required the youths to
appear in Juvenile Traffic Court with a parent or guardian. If they
treated the judge the way they treated their teacher and failed to
show up, an arrest warrant was issued and their driver's license
suspended. If found guilty they were subject to a fine and community
service.</TE>
<TE>   But punishment is not the main goal of enforcement efforts.
Education is. And involvement by the district attorney and court must
remain the last resort in a series of steps, including counseling,
parenting classes and mentors to keep children in school.</TE>
<TE>   Frequent absences put the student behind in classwork. That
struggling often leads to poor grades, being held back or eventually
dropping out entirely. Police also say  habitual truants are more
prone to being involved in crime or becoming victims of crimes, while
on the street instead of in the class- room.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the first two cases prosecuted under the new enforcement
program launched in August, one father, whose son had missed 45 days
of the first few months of the new school year, was ordered to have
his son in school and also to sit in his son's fourth-grade class at
least once a week.</TE>
<TE>   The students and parents who fail to follow a judge's attendance
order face possible probation, curfews, loss of driver's license,
fines and even a jail sentence. In the long run, the loss to them and
the community from habitual truancy is much more costly.</TE>

<LD>   The Board of Supervisors is to be commended for its leadership in
planning responsibly for the future of John Wayne Airport. John Wayne
is critical for the future of Orange County, especially for residents
of the corridor cities of Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, Newport Beach,
Orange, Tustin and Anaheim. Residents of these cities directly
experience the environmental effects of John Wayne but, along with
residents throughout the county, benefit from having a local airport.</LD>
<LD>   The board voted unanimously to certify the environmental impact
report and direct staff to negotiate an extension of the agreement
using Scenario 1 as a basis. Scenario 1 maintains the 10 p.m. to 7
a.m. curfew restrictions until 2015, and, recognizing the need for
limited and controlled future growth, allows for an additional four
gates and 12 flights per day.</LD>
<TE>   I am honored to have been able to work with the board and council
members from the other cities that feel committed to protecting the
interests of our constituents. I thank all the supervisors for their
leadership on this issue and look forward to continuing to have John
Wayne Airport as a friendly neighbor for decades to come.</TE>

<TE>   Those who support more air travel in Orange County wanted to build
an El Toro airport, but they don't support adding more air travel in
Orange County at the same time?</TE>
<TE>   After reading that the Board of Supervisors agreed that artificial
flight restrictions and caps should be renewed at John Wayne Airport,
and that 9,000 "Renew the caps at JWA" postcards came in from the
residents of Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, Orange, Anaheim, Tustin and
Santa Ana (many of whom support an airport at El Toro), I was
astonished.</TE>
<TE>   How can one support future commercial air travel and at the same
time be against it? This just goes to show the voters of Orange
County how confused--or should I say hypocritical--the opponents of
Measure W really were. If we really need more air travel in Orange
County to help relieve the congestion and future demand, we must
support the lifting of artificial flight restrictions, caps and
curfews at John Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   However, the message is clear now: Orange County does not need
more airports or flights.</TE>

<LD>Re "Plant in Surf City to Bleach Waste," Feb. 23:</LD>
<LD>   According to The Times, the Orange County Sanitation District will
use bleach to eliminate potential danger from the effluent off
Huntington Beach. Is this to protect the public by disinfecting the
effluent? No, it's to give the illusion of protection, another con
job by the authorities.</LD>
<LD>   As stated in the article, half the waste water receives only
primary treatment. Any sanitary engineer worth his or her salt knows
better than to chlorinate primary effluent. Chlorine (bleach) might
disinfect the secondary effluent but not the primary effluent because
the suspended solids are not treatable with chlorine. Even though it
can disinfect the exterior surfaces, the interior is unaffected. As
the solids break up in the outfall plume, the mass of entrained
bacteria is released. As a result, the effect of the chlorine is
negligible.</LD>
<TE>   This does not necessarily mean that the effluent is dangerous,
just that the chlorination is an illusion to fool the public.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph F. Cuny</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation District officials have been told since 1996 (or,
possibly, 1987) that the sewage plume comes "uncomfortably close" to
our precious surfing and swimming beaches. They say bleaching the
bacteria is only an interim solution but necessary now that they
accept their critics' contention that "swimming in lumpy water is a
fact, not an hypothesis to be tested." But the solution, $10 million
(not the $5 million originally estimated) worth of bleach each year,
is more akin to pounding bugs with a sledgehammer than swatting a few
pesky flies now and then. Pollution of our beaches is an off-again,
on-again thing, but until science can tell us exactly when to
disinfect, the first answer should be better sewage treatment.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Differing Views of Losing Sewage Waiver," Feb. 24:</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 5, representatives from the Orange County Sanitation
District advised the Fullerton City Council that there is no
scientific proof that the sewage plume comes to shore. Six days later
it was learned that the plume was half a mile off Newport Pier at a
depth of 45 feet. We thank the district for its decision to disinfect
the millions of gallons of waste water with chlorine. However,
because chlorine brings with it unknown risks to marine life and the
potential to form chemical byproducts, we trust this will be a
temporary measure as the district considers full secondary treatment,
abandoning its 301(h) waiver.</TE>

<TE>   Re "9 O.C. Wells Closed," Jan. 30:</TE>
<TE>   Let's be more accurate. You state: "[T]reated sewage was injected
into the ground water." A reader might interpret this to mean the
sewage was only disinfected and then injected into the aquifer.
Instead, high-purity water is extracted from sewage after much
processing, including a final filtering through reverse-osmosis
membranes. Only then is it injected into the ground-water supply.</TE>
<TE>   Also, you refer to the amount expected to cause one cancer death
per million people. This information comes from the Environmental
Protection Agency, which has accepted an "extrapolation theory" that
has not been proved. The theory suggests that if the number of cancer
cases versus the contamination level of a substance follows a
straight line when graphed, then from known high contamination levels
we can extrapolate to low levels and show the number of cancer deaths
that will result.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, we have never proved that this extrapolation
theory is correct for any substance, particularly for very low levels
of contamination. The EPA regularly uses these kinds of
extrapolations, then publishes the result as fact.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Water District has done the right thing in
closing these wells in order to meet EPA and state requirements. My
fear is that citizens will be unduly frightened by these bogus cancer
death projections. Our citizens should be made aware of how these
contamination levels are set. The bottom line: Our tap water is safe.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Agency Asks Approval to Fight Runoff," Jan. 28:</TE>
<TE>   I live in the Salt Creek watershed (Dana Point), a small watershed
by most standards. Since 1993, when I moved here, I've seen it
deteriorate from a clean creek filled with waterfowl into a filthy
collection basin for street runoff that includes dog feces and lawn
chemicals. It is moribund now, and death is imminent. The pretty
beach towns, vacation spots like Dana Point, don't complain much
because calling attention to the pollution is bad for business. But
something needs to be done by the polluters: us.</TE>

<LD>   Because the exploitation of adjunct faculty hurts students,

of these will work together to end it. But Linda Cushing and others
have shown that even without help, adjunct instructors can determine
their future if they manage, despite institutional obstacles, to
unite. I applaud the growing number of adjunct faculty who have done
so, and I urge the rest to make organizing a priority. Like Cushing,
we can refuse to accept oppressive working conditions.</LD>

<LD>Re "Financial Jam Mires O.C.'s Toll Highways," Feb. 11:</LD>
<LD>   Tollway operators consistently have addressed low ridership by
raising tolls, as if oblivious to the fact that those of us who avoid
the tollway do so because of the outrageous cost. Hasn't it ever
occurred to them that lowering the tolls might attract a greater
volume? Hello?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The recent increase to $3 for anyone who passes the toll booths on
the San Joaquin Hills toll road now means that one entering
southbound at Newport Coast Drive and exiting at Laguna Canyon Road
pays about $1 per mile. That's far more than the cost on the
infamously expensive Italian Autostrada.</TE>
<TE>   The cost should be based only on the distance driven. Wouldn't
lowering the fee attract more users?</TE>

<LD>Re "Successful Transit (Not CenterLine)," Commentary, Jan. 20:</LD>
<LD>   You print a picture of congestion on the San Diego Freeway, then
ask: Is rail the answer or a waste of money? The answer, believe it
or not, is in all the studies that the Orange County Transportation
Authority has acquired. In summation: Light rail will carry about
0.5% of daily traffic, thus doing zero toward solving congestion. It
just wastes money that could be spent for highway solutions.</LD>

<TE>   Re "What CenterLine Can and Can't Do," Letters, Jan. 27:</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Koontz supports CenterLine, the billion-dollar
boondoggle that goes nowhere and criticizes the toll roads, saying,
"The toll roads through eastern and southern Orange County have done
an excellent job at accelerating sprawl ... but not at reducing
traffic." He attributes the heavy traffic on South County arterials
to failure of the toll roads.</TE>
<TE>   We have a rail system in place called Metrolink. I ride it twice a
week into Los Angeles, and a new station in Mission Viejo will open
this spring. Second, CenterLine is supported only by Irvine and will
not do anything to reduce traffic. It doesn't go anywhere. It will
soak up funding that could be used to upgrade Metrolink, a real
transit system, and improve arterial roads in the county. Third, the
toll roads that Koontz attacks are being blocked by his
environmentalist allies from connecting with Interstate 5 in San
Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   The Eastern Transportation Corridor was seriously damaged by a
political decision years ago to connect it to the Riverside Freeway
instead of to the Costa Mesa Freeway near the Santa Ana Freeway
junction because of opposition from North County residents.</TE>
<TE>   Completion of the Foothill corridor would help Mission Viejo
residents who are being deluged by traffic from new developments to
the east. Stopping it will not stop development unless Koontz wants
to buy Rancho Mission Viejo and turn it into a park. We have the U.S.
Constitution that prohibits "taking" of private property without
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who are trying to find real solutions for real
problems in Orange County are not amused by the antics of ideologues
who are part of the problem, not part of the solution.</TE>

<LD>Ellis Jones, an All-American football player for the University of
Tulsa during the 1940s despite having just one arm, has died. He was
80.</LD>
<LD>   Jones died Feb. 24 at a hospital in Greeley, Colo., of injuries
sustained in a fall at his home.</LD>
<LD>   Playing when collegiate ranks were depleted by wartime manpower
requirements, Jones was a standout on offense and defense for the
Oklahoma team. Tulsa's 1943 squad included 24 players who were
classified 4-F, unsuitable for military service.</LD>
<TE>   ''He was one of the best football players I ever saw, in that he
absolutely worked at full speed all the time,'' said Glenn Dobbs, who
was an All-American halfback on Tulsa's excellent football squad in
1942.</TE>
<TE>   ''He was intelligent, tough, strong, fast, and nobody ever thought
about him just having one arm after they saw him do something one
time,'' Dobbs added.</TE>
<TE>   ''They knew he was a winner.''</TE>
<TE>   Jones grew up in Abilene, Texas, but lost his arm at the age of 11
after falling out of a tree and suffering a compound fracture. The
arm was amputated eight inches below the shoulder after he developed
gangrene.</TE>
<TE>   ''It never occurred to me that I could not keep playing
football,'' Jones told a reporter years later.</TE>
<TE>   ''I guess I was too dumb to think I could not do it.''</TE>
<TE>   He started three years at left guard on offense for Tulsa. He also
played defense.</TE>
<TE>   ''My theory was you had to run over me, or I tried to shoot
through you,'' Jones said of his prowess on defense.</TE>
<TE>   ''I missed some tackles. Everyone does."</TE>
<TE>   Those Tulsa teams were among the nation's best. The 1942 squad was
rated No. 4 by the Associated Press after posting a 10-0 record.</TE>
<TE>   Jones played in the 1945 College All Star game against the Chicago
Bears and played an NFL season with the Boston Yanks.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, the University of Tulsa retired his number and inducted
him into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   He worked as a broker of oil and natural gas leases after his
football career ended.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters; a brother; and
six grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Firm May Get Tax Boon in Land Gift</HD>
<DH>Development: The Irvine Co. may get a whopping IRS break in
its transfer of 11,000 open acres to O.C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren's gift of 11,000 acres of open
space to the people of Orange County could also reap the company
hundreds of millions of dollars in tax deductions, in what appears to
be the largest tax break of its kind.</LD>
<LD>   Using "conservation easements"--an increasingly popular method of
preserving land--the company is signing over development rights on
the land while retaining ownership for 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   That will yield not just hefty tax breaks but also the ability to
design and control public access as the company sees fit.</LD>
<TE>   By writing off thousands of acres of steep, nearly unbuildable
terrain prone to landslides, along with prime smaller pieces slated
for development, the company also could maximize value on land that
is worth as little as 3 cents a square foot on the latest tax rolls.</TE>
<TE>   Bren's gift, announced in November, has been widely praised by
company critics and admirers alike. The subject of tax breaks for the
company has drawn speculation but no criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tax benefit, all of it is legal, all of it's correct,"
said Theresa Sears, an Orange resident who has fought Irvine Co.
developments in east Orange, including some on lands that will now be
preserved.</TE>
<TE>   "The people benefited, and Bren, a smart man, will benefit too.
It's a win-win for everybody. So none of us over here that got our
gift have to be beholden to the Irvine Co. down the road, because Don
Bren got a gift too."</TE>
<TE>   Craig Atkins, partner at O'Donnell Atkins Co., California's
largest land broker, said the tax breaks are part of the beauty of
the package.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fantastic deal for everyone," Atkins said. "You can't pave
over everything. If you're a neighbor living in Orange County, it's
great, and if you're [Bren's] banker, it's also great.... That's Don
Bren. He's got it wired.... The guy is brilliant."</TE>
<TE>   Bren is sole owner of the Irvine Co. Company officials declined to
be interviewed about the tax ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't discuss finances," said spokesman Rich Elbaum.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Florian, group senior vice president of corporate affairs,
said: "Whatever charitable contribution would be permitted under law
is what would be applicable here."</TE>
<TE>   She said she was not familiar with the details but "ultimately,
that is decided by the IRS."</TE>
<TE>   An IRS spokesman confirmed the legal structure of conservation
easements but said no information about specific cases could be
released by the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation easements allow a donor who signs away development
rights to deduct the difference between what the land would have sold
for if it could be developed and what it would sell for without such
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Income-tax records and land appraisals are private, but several
land-sales professionals, including Atkins, said that in the red-hot
Southern California real estate market, the total acreage with
development rights would sell for at least $500 million. Without the
potential for development, the land would be worth as little as $88
million, those same experts said. The tax deduction under this
scenario would be $412 million--the value of the lost development
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Experts interviewed emphasized that those figures probably
understate the value of the property and the ensuing deduction.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lack of supply of housing and a glut of demand in
Orange County," which drives up the worth of land that can be
developed, said Bob Holman, a certified general appraiser at CB
Commercial in Orange County. "Appraisal is an art as much as a
science, and there's always a range of potential values.... [$500
million] is a conservative figure," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the amount of the deduction, "it will absolutely be the
largest" of its kind, said Stephen Small, who wrote the original IRS
code on conservation easements and has written four books on land
ownership and taxes. Small, now a Boston-based private attorney, has
prepared hundreds of conservation easements and said the most
substantial yielded tax benefits of $10 million to $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Land Trust Alliance, a national nonprofit that tracks open
land, said the number of conservation easements is "skyrocketing."</TE>
<TE>   Usually they are used to preserve smaller, prized pieces in resort
areas like Jackson Hole, Wyo.; Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts; or
Aspen, Colo.; or large rural lands. In the largest acreage
conservation easement to date, the Pingree timber family signed over
development rights to 750,000 acres of Maine woods and was paid $30
million. Because the family was paid, it did not receive income-tax
deductions.</TE>
<TE>   But because of its size and location in fast-growing, wealthy
Orange County, "there is no land like Bren's anywhere else in the
U.S.," said Atkins, the California land broker.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation easements can be tailored to the landowner's wishes
as long as they do not irrevocably destroy ecological values.</TE>
<TE>   Bren and the Irvine Co. are dividing the 11,000-acre gift into
seven conservation easements to be signed over to the Nature
Conservancy by the end of June.</TE>
<TE>   Only one has been recorded so far. Records on the so-called Laguna
Laurel easement, 173 acres in Irvine near Laguna Canyon Road, show
the Irvine Co. has reserved the right to send urban runoff from an
adjacent new development across the preserved land.</TE>
<TE>   A similar tactic led to costly delays a few years ago for the
company on its upscale Newport Coast development, after the state
Coastal Commission questioned rights the company had retained to
drain runoff across Crystal Cove state park when it sold the parkland
to the state.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are no immediate plans to put in utility lines and
roads, the company also has reserved rights to do so, and even
conduct "slant" drilling under the site from adjoining lands.</TE>
<TE>   Company and Nature Conservancy officials said the impact and size
of any such construction would be extremely limited and would require
approval by appropriate government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Small, who wrote the original conservation code, called the
runoff, roads and other rights "novel."</TE>
<TE>   He said the "first line of defense" in monitoring a landowner's
compliance with conservation values is the designated environmental
group that is the recipient of the easement.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, that group is the Nature Conservancy, which is being
paid $20 million by the Irvine Co. to manage all its open space.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime activist Sherry Meddick said possible roads through the
open space in east Orange, along with other new roads and development
nearby, will destroy essential wildlife corridors.</TE>
<TE>   "The mountain lions are going to need a road map and crossing
guards," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Trish Smith, senior biologist in Orange County for The Nature
Conservancy, is overseeing the gift land. She expressed concern over
roads that might be built in easement areas. But she said the
proposed development nearby would not block wildlife corridors.</TE>
<TE>   She said studies had shown mountain lions and other animals
primarily move through the lands that are being set aside.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'd been asked a year and a half ago what was needed [for
wildlife corridors], these are exactly the lands I would have
selected," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Florian said the Irvine Co. does not deem new roads necessary on
the gift lands, but it didn't want to rule them out.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Goes Into Full Attack Mode on Secession</HD>
<DH>City: With Valley, Hollywood and harbor breakaways
apparently headed for the ballot, mayor calls it 'a recipe for
disaster' and vows vigorous opposition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn strode into a park gymnasium a mile
from his San Pedro home Saturday to launch his personal campaign
against secession, calling the proposed Valley, Hollywood and harbor
area breakaways a "recipe for disaster."</LD>
<LD>   "This harebrained scheme is going to leave people worse off than
they are now," he said before his testimony to the state agency that
oversees secession issues. "It's a bad idea, and I'm going to
convince everyone that it's not in our best interest."</LD>
<LD>   The mayor's campaign-style comments come as the breakup of Los
Angeles appears headed for the November ballot.</LD>
<TE>   Last week the Local Agency Formation Commission decided that
Hollywood would be financially viable if it split from the city, and
it has already issued a preliminary report laying out how the San
Fernando Valley and the harbor area, composed of San Pedro and
Wilmington, could support themselves.</TE>
<TE>   In anticipation of an all-out secession battle at the polls, Hahn
and other opponents have begun strategizing their campaign, which
will probably play into emotional themes about keeping Los Angeles
together.</TE>
<TE>   The first words from Hahn on Saturday: "We are a city better
united than divided."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he waited until the close of the primary election season
before launching into anti-secession messages, but now intends to be
"very aggressive" in voicing his opposition. He said he will hit the
phones to raise money for the campaign and devote several hours a
week to fending off the breakup.</TE>
<TE>   While listening to a report projecting that to be financially
viable a new harbor city would have to slash services now provided by
Los Angeles by 32%, Hahn shook his head no. During and after his
testimony he used some of his strongest words yet against secession.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine, almost a one-third reduction in services. This is not
what people in my neighborhood want to see," Hahn told the panel. No
one in the harbor area wants to see any reduction of services, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said secession supporters in the Valley, Hollywood and the
harbor area are "chasing this phantom solution which really looks
like a recipe for disaster to me."</TE>
<TE>   Under the harbor scenario, he said, Los Angeles cannot afford to
subsidize $59 million in services during the fledging city's
transition period--as LAFCO has suggested--even if the new harbor
city paid Los Angeles back with interest over a 10-year period.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes you mad, it makes you angry, because the people are
being hoodwinked here by secession proponents," Hahn said of the
so-called deferred payments. "How are we going to defer those costs?
We would have to make additional cuts in our budget."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of wasting so much energy on secession, the mayor said,
"let's spend that energy making our services work better. Let's spend
that energy listening to people in the neighborhoods--that's the way
we address the problems."</TE>
<TE>   He predicted his campaign against the breakup will show "that
there are not a lot of people behind these movements, but
unfortunately the legal process has allowed this molehill to turn
into a snowball down the mountain."</TE>
<TE>   He said no one in his own San Pedro neighborhood supports
secession. Yet 13,470 residents, or 25% of the registered voters in
the proposed city, signed a petition in favor of the split.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to control our own destiny," said Andrew Mardesich, a
longtime San Pedro resident who heads the breakaway group.</TE>
<TE>   His committee is not deterred by the projection of service cuts in
a new city, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There needs to be a 30% cut in waste. We won't reduce services,
we'll reduce waste," Mardesich said. "All Hahn knows is big money and
big government."</TE>
<TE>   He characterized the harbor campaign as a tight grass-roots
movement that will not be swayed by a sophisticated political
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all word-of-mouth out here. Everyone knows somebody or is
related to somebody," he said. "That's our power."</TE>
<TE>   About 20 residents attended the LAFCO hearing, one of a series
being held throughout the secession areas. Nearly every speaker
favored the split, citing the lack of city services and concerns over
air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "There are streets in Wilmington that have never been paved. There
are streets in Wilmington without sidewalks," said Jesse Marquez,
president of a local environmental group, who charged that the city
has long ignored the heavy amounts of air pollution generated by the
Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Christensen, a 47-year San Pedro resident who supports the
breakup, wants the people of her community to vote on the issue,
convinced that they will win a new city.</TE>
<TE>   "Our new city will provide oversight on the issue," she said,
adding that she is not concerned about potential budget problems. "We
will have so much community pride that as our own city we will be
able to fill in the gaps."</TE>

<HD>Mati Klarwein, 70; Album Cover Artist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mati Klarwein, the surrealist painter who designed psychedelic album
covers for rock bands and jazz musicians, including Santana, Miles
Davis, and Earth, Wind and Fire, has died. He was 70.</LD>
<LD>   Klarwein died Wednesday night at his home in Deia, an artists'
colony on the Spanish island of Majorca, officials of the
municipality said Friday without giving the cause of death.</LD>
<LD>   Klarwein was born in Hamburg, Germany, and grew up in what became
Israel, after his parents fled the Nazis in 1934. While studying art
in Paris in the late 1940s, he took an interest in jazz and was
captivated by the eerie surrealism of Salvador Dali.</LD>
<TE>   He later met Dali in the 1970s, when Klarwein's studio in New York
drew visits from the Spanish artist and prominent personalities such
as Davis, Timothy Leary and others.</TE>
<TE>   Klarwein's trademark was magical scenes with an erotic blaze of
rich, deep colors and African and countercultural symbols.</TE>
<TE>   One of Klarwein's most famous album covers was for Santana's
"Abraxas."</TE>
<TE>   It showed the artist's 1963 painting "The Annunciation," which
depicted the biblical story in which the archangel Gabriel tells Mary
that she will give birth to Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Santana said he liked the work because "music and color are
food for the soul."</TE>
<TE>   In "The Annunciation," Klarwein based the nude black Virgin Mary
on a girlfriend from Guadeloupe and painted himself as Joseph,
wearing a straw hat. A winged, crimson Gabriel flies down from heaven
on a conga drum.</TE>
<TE>   "Drums were always used to announce something," Klarwein said.
"They were a medium of communication in Africa."</TE>
<TE>   Klarwein also painted album covers for Davis' "Bitches Brew" and
"Live Evil" and Buddy Miles' "Hell and Back." He also created
illustrations for Jimi Hendrix, Jerry Garcia, and Earth, Wind and
Fire.</TE>
<TE>   Klarwein denied several years ago that taking drugs had provided
him with artistic inspiration. "I painted psychedelically before I
took psychedelics," he said.</TE>
<TE>   No information was available on survivors.</TE>

<HD>Highflying Dreams Lead Pilot to Both the Military and FBI</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Alex Ford is talking about his boyhood dreams, and everything that's
happened since the days when he began to see flying as a way to
escape the Nebraska cornfields.</LD>
<LD>   First he was a Marine Corps aviator, then a pilot for the FBI. And
now, in the aftermath of Sept. 11, he is both flying for the FBI and
training a new generation of pilots for the Marines.</LD>
<LD>   He's in his flight suit, strolling past a row of F/A-18 Hornet
attack jets on the runway at the Marine Corps Air Station at Miramar.
This is where he's been spending many of his days lately, sharing
everything he knows with young Marine pilots still six months or so
away from possible combat duty.</LD>
<TE>   His call sign as a Marine pilot is Spud, and it suits him as an
FBI agent, too. He's built like a fireplug. A boxer back in college,
he likes to mix it up as an agent. And just hanging out at Miramar
seems to pump him up.</TE>
<TE>   "I love being a Marine," he said. "I love putting on the uniform.
I love being able to say, 'Hey, I was a part of it.'"</TE>
<TE>   He loves the FBI work, too. In addition to his work as a pilot,
he's also a street agent with a knack for catching fugitives and a
taste for fast action. "He's one of the best," said his boss, William
Gore, head of the FBI's San Diego office.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Nelson, another FBI pilot in San Diego, says Ford is one of
the most skilled pilots he's ever flown with, and an agent with so
much energy that it makes Nelson tired just watching him.</TE>
<TE>   "Alex is very aggressive, very smart and he loves to have 20
million things going at once," Nelson said. "Most people couldn't
begin to do what he's been doing since Sept. 11, but it suits him
perfectly."</TE>
<TE>   Ford's parents bought a small Cessna when he was a senior in high
school in Grand Island, Neb., and that's when he started flying. Then
it was on to the University of Nebraska, where he joined the Marines
officer candidate program.</TE>
<TE>   As a new Marine pilot, his training took him from T-34 turboprops
to Harrier attack jets, with stops in Pensacola, Fla.; Beeville,
Texas; and Cherry Point, N.C. In the following years, he was deployed
to Japan, Korea, the Philippines, the southern Atlantic, then back to
Cherry Point as a flight instructor.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1992, Ford was assigned to Twentynine Palms. There he
helped develop the Pioneer, a remote-piloted vehicle that was a
forerunner of the unmanned Predators operated by the CIA in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Ford resigned his commission and applied to the major
airlines to be a commercial pilot. He didn't find a job there, but
did at Aeronautical Systems, the San Diego company that developed the
Predator. Ford was a project leader, and he operated the Predator out
of Albania during the Bosnian war.</TE>
<TE>   He became an FBI agent in 1996. He had applied two years
earlier--about the time it often takes for FBI applicants to get
hired. He was still a pilot, but now he was a door-kicker, too. And
he loved it.</TE>
<TE>   "I took a $60,000 pay cut to get this job and I have never
regretted it," Ford said. "I just love chasing people down. I love
being the first guy through the door."</TE>
<TE>   He has caught 500 fugitives in the last five years, he says, with
a personal record of nine arrests before noon. The key, he says, is
staying with a case, following up, and putting in some extra effort.</TE>
<TE>   And staying excited about his work.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when I was a new agent, and my mentor asked me what my
mission was as an agent," Ford recalled. "I said it was putting away
as many bad guys as I could. Wrong, he said. It's making friends.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a people business," Ford added. "You treat people with
dignity and respect and you will get it back. I can't tell you how
many times I've had a mother tell me where I could find her son
because she felt I was fair.</TE>
<TE>   "The more friends you make, the more people you catch," he said.</TE>
<TE>   These days Ford is on some special assignments he can't talk about
(and his bosses won't even let his face be photographed). All he'll
say is: "Both my jobs are focused on the war against terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   His wife woke him on the morning of Sept. 11. Like everyone else,
Ford watched the planes crash over and over again into the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon on television replays.</TE>
<TE>   "I ended up at March Air Force Base in Riverside, helping with
some Special Ops training," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a lieutenant colonel in the Marine reserves, Ford, 41, has
always put in some time on weekend military duties, building the
retirement points needed to eventually get a military pension.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a full-time job until after Sept. 11. And Ford had to do
a lot of talking with both the FBI and the Marines to get the chance
to work with Miramar's active-duty Hornet squadrons.</TE>
<TE>   On the military side, Ford was setting a precedent. He was a
reserve officer offering himself up as free labor seeking assignment
to an active-duty squadron.</TE>
<TE>   That meant cutting through a lot of Defense Department red tape.</TE>
<TE>   But the FBI needed to know that Ford's work as an agent would take
precedence when the bureau needed him. Ford convinced everybody it
would work.</TE>
<TE>   "When my grandkids ask, 'What did you do in the war on terrorism?'
I can say I helped fight it with the bureau and with the Marines,"
Ford said.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now I'm helping train some of the people who will be going
overseas," he added. "Ultimately, I want the chance to go back on
active duty for 30 or 45 days and go over there myself, do whatever I
can to free other people up."</TE>
<TE>   Once the Navy's Top Gun school, Miramar is home to 11,000 Marines.
There are seven Hornet squadrons. About 400 men and women are in the
training squad Ford is working with now, 80 of them pilots and
weapons systems officers.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to relieve some of the pressure on everybody else," Ford
said. "I teach subjects like fundamentals of marksmanship and cockpit
resource management. But I've also written a drug policy report on
Ecstasy and sat on a court martial."</TE>
<TE>   Cockpit resource management? Ford says that boils down to keeping
your eyes open and communicating "aggressively" with fellow pilots on
such matters as incoming missiles and enemy planes.</TE>
<TE>   And marksmanship? The key is trigger control, Ford says; just
about everybody's a little too quick on the trigger.</TE>
<TE>   Marine Lt. Col. Dave Kelly went through Marine training with Ford
two decades ago and more recently served with him at Miramar.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the only guy I've ever known who has ever done something
like this," Kelly said. "And it goes far beyond weapons training and
that other stuff. A lot of guys have to learn officer qualities. Ford
is a man who can teach honesty and integrity along the way. That's
pretty rare."</TE>
<TE>   The boy on the farm never imagined a war on terrorism--or the
satisfaction he would find in his admittedly modest role.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for that dream, I wouldn't be here today," Ford
said. "I wouldn't trade it for anything. I'm having way too much
fun."</TE>

<LD>A leaky valve on a fire truck spewed concentrated fire retardant into
a watershed that feeds a prime spawning habitat for endangered coho

<HD>The New O.C. Voter Pays Up</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTIAN COLLET</AU>
<BD>Christian Collet is president of Pacific Opinions, an
Irvine-based independent research firm, and a visiting professor in
the department of political science at UC Irvine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the dust settles from Tuesday's election, there is continued
evidence of transformation in the historical hotbed of conservatism
known as Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Conventional thinking would have suggested that a low-turnout
election in which a conservative wins at the top of the ticket would
also reveal a resistance to local tax increases, particularly during
uncertain economic times.</LD>
<LD>   Yet local voters not only rejected the "Great Tax" arguments
against a central park at El Toro, but also supported the sale of
more than $700 million in school bonds. An electorate in which 3 in 5
voters are Republican saw, in seven school districts, an average of 3
in 5 say yes to what will amount to about $75 more per year in
property taxes.</LD>
<TE>   Rule changes are combining with political trends to create a new
era for the financing of public schools. Though Richard Riordan most
likely saw his political career end Tuesday, March 2002 may be just
the beginning for the initiative he backed in November 2000:
Proposition 39. Since its passage, every district in California that
has run a bond measure campaign under Proposition 39's guidelines has
had success at the polls. On Tuesday, the perfect streak swept
through Orange County, as measures from Yorba Linda to Huntington
Beach passed under the new 55% threshold imposed by Proposition 39.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of the media attention focused on measures in
Anaheim and Huntington Beach, where bond measures failed in past
elections, perhaps the most telling sign of change occurred in
Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified. One might have expected the birthplace
of Richard Nixon, a disproportionately Republican area with high
median home values, to generate significant opposition to what could
be a $100-or-higher increase in property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet without so much as an opposing argument on the ballot, 66% of
the voters passed the measure, the highest level of support given to
a bond in Orange County this year.</TE>
<TE>   Under Proposition 13, the popular Measure Y would have narrowly
failed and sent district planners back to the drawing board for
years. Under Proposition 39, it gave $102 million in new bonds to the
schools.</TE>
<TE>   The success of bond measures is not merely a function of new
rules, but also of a changing climate, one that hears candidates from
all ideological stripes sing the chorus of public school failure.
Similar to the way public sentiment has crystallized against an
international airport at El Toro, a bipartisan voter consensus has
emerged in Orange County in the past few years to make education a
priority. A countywide telephone survey conducted by Pacific Opinions
among registered voters three weeks before the election confirmed it:
"Improving local schools" was named by 41% of voters as an issue that
should be a "top priority" for local officials to address, ranking
above traffic congestion, health care and airport security.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, even though candidates and voters are focused on education
and pass school bonds, one should not assume opinions on the
financial condition of schools are as fully developed. Voter
perceptions of the state of school facilities--and, particularly, how
schools manage money--are undefined.</TE>
<TE>   Many who show a willingness to back bonds do not necessarily
connect their support to a declining condition of public school
facilities. When asked if they would support a bond measure if it
were to appear on the ballot in their area, 50% of county voters said
yes, including 60% of parents who have children in the public
schools.</TE>
<TE>   But more than 40% of those who say they would vote yes on a bond
also believe their local schools are in good shape financially.
Overall, just 28% believe local schools are in bad shape
financially--a view that might dramatically contrast with the
teachers and administrators who face budget crises on a regular
basis.</TE>
<TE>   When asked how schools budget their money--a common line of attack
from bond critics--voter attitudes become murkier. Just 38% believe
schools manage finances wisely, whereas 30% say they waste money.
More telling, however, is that more than 30% say they do not know
what schools are doing with their money. This includes 1 in 4
parents.</TE>
<TE>   Although a new era has emerged in Orange County for schools, and
for passing bonds, districts should not interpret Tuesday's vote as
widespread awareness of the financial problems facing public schools
and their dilapidated facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in a traditionally anti-tax county are warm to the idea of
supporting education through taxation, but district officials will
need to do their share of educating the public about the need for
improved facilities if the perfect record of Proposition 39 in Orange
County is to be maintained.</TE>

method" violates Propositions 13 and 8. "Recapture method" refers to
the assessor's practice of increasing assessments more than 2% in one
year after a decline in value, though the property wasn't newly
constructed and didn't change ownership.</LD>
<LD>   "Temporary" isn't in Propositions 13 or 8. In January 1979, a
legislative task force, comprising assessors and other bureaucrats,
issued a report on implementing Propositions 13 and 8. Ignoring the
California Constitution's plain language, that task force thought
that a decline in value should be temporary.</LD>
<LD>   So began California taxpayers' odyssey that saw assessments jump
lately as much as 100% in one year. In 1998, my family challenged the
assessor before the Assessment Appeals Board. Guillory lost at the
board, and we recovered $100.55. The county then sued my family. Two
years later, the county lost again.</LD>
<TE>   The county refuses to admit defeat, yet it won't face the merits
of this lawsuit publicly in the press or even on the county
assessor's Web site, www.oc.ca.gov/assessor. There you'll find
thousands of words about the "2% Case" but nothing from California's
Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the county shifts the focus from the ruling on
California's Constitution (the real issue), to what it might cost the
government to obey the law. I'm well aware of California's current
fiscal crisis. But exactly when a cost standard to measure
governmental misconduct displaced the rule of law escaped my
attention.</TE>
<TE>   The question is: 2(b) or not 2(b)? In 1978, Proposition 13
revolutionized California property taxation. The pending class-action
lawsuit centers on Section 2(b), a single sentence in the 1978
landmark law. The 58 words of 2(b) remain unchanged since November
1978, when Proposition 8 (the initiative that clarified the original
intent of Proposition 13 to allow declines in value) passed by a 78%
margin.</TE>
<TE>   The essential words in 2(b):</TE>
<TE>   "The full cash value base may reflect from year to year the
inflationary rate not to exceed 2% for any given year ... or may be
reduced to reflect substantial damage, destruction or other factors
causing a decline in value."</TE>
<TE>   Ask yourself two questions:</TE>
<TE>   1) May the full cash value base be reduced?</TE>
<TE>   2) If it's reduced, may the full cash value base be increased more
than 2% per year?</TE>
<TE>   When you answer yes to the first question and no to the second,
you agree with the judge. It's that simple.</TE>
<TE>   File a refund claim. Sixty-three percent of Orange County's
810,000 total parcels are single-family residences. Orange County's
treasurer-tax collector says that nearly half of property taxpayers
here (roughly 405,000 countywide) are likely victims of the
unconstitutional recapturing method. You may obtain refund claim
forms and more information online at www.propertytaxrefunds.biz.</TE>

<HD>Week Was Jam-Packed</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>First, the raw numbers. Two conference basketball tournaments. Four
games. Two counties. Seven freeways. One day.</LD>
<LD>   It might have been lost amid the hype and complaints about the
Pacific 10 tournament, but the Big West Conference hosted its annual
get-together last week, as well. That put eight games on the menu in
Southern California on Thursday. I figured I'd try the sample platter
and try two from each conference.</LD>
<LD>   The Pac-10 tournament had the big-time buzz even before I stepped
in the arena. Hot 92 and Fox Sports Radio had tents set up outside,
with a deejay from Hot 92 spinning "I Want You Back" as I walked in.</LD>
<TE>   The first college game at Staples Center felt like a hodge-podge
of the L.A. basketball scene. The voice coming through the speakers
belonged to Lawrence Tanter, the Lakers' public-address announcer.
The court belonged to the Sparks, who use the same three-point
distance as the NCAA. The play-by-play in the stats books bore the
distinctive stamp of Rich Perelman, who usually handles the duties at
UCLA. His descriptions always have flair, such as "Jones steal, drive
and breakaway right-hand tomahawk cram" or "Jackson 22 ft. right
baseline golden archer."</TE>
<TE>   I thought the vast Staples Center would swallow up any atmosphere,
but it was lively. Close, but not quite matching an NCAA tournament
site. For example, tournament crowds usually adopt an underdog, but
the Staples folks didn't really get behind Washington in its bid to
upset Oregon. Maybe it's because people in L.A. are too into their
own thing. The loudest cheer during the game came when the Trojans
left their seats to head to the locker room and prepare for their
matchup with Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Man, did it get loud for that game. Much better than the Sports
Arena. USC had it rolling so well, I even caught a few UCLA fans
applauding.</TE>
<TE>   Since USC had the game well in hand, I did the SoCal thing and
left early to beat traffic. The 10 to the 5 (with a little detour to
the 605 to the 91 to avoid traffic) got me to Anaheim in about an
hour. A much easier time parking at the Anaheim Convention Center.
Much cheaper, too. Try half of the $20 they were asking at Staples.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the arena, it was hard to believe this game had anything to
do with the NCAA tournament. You'd think the winners would get a
ribbon, not a ticket to the Big Dance.</TE>
<TE>   There were three rows of NBA scouts sitting in Section 113 at
Staples Center. At the Big West, you needed a scout just to find a
scout. At the Pac-10 tournament, you know you're watching six teams
that will play in the NCAAs. At the Big West tournament, you know
you'll see only one advance.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,000 people were in the small arena. There were probably as
many empty seats at Anaheim as there were at Staples, but here those
empty seats constituted half the arena.</TE>
<TE>   The Big West tournament prominently features an important element
of college basketball: college students. The UC Irvine contingent was
especially noticeable, seated (well, technically, they didn't
actually sit down) on the corner of the court and wearing bright
yellow shirts. They brought the noise, filling the arena with sound.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine was battling Long Beach State in the second half, and
when I walked in, Jerry Green was doing his thing. He was easily the
best player on the floor, one who could hold his own with any of the
guys in the Pac-10 tournament. The Anteaters held off Long Beach
State to win, 72-65. But for the second consecutive year, UC Irvine
has had an excellent regular season wiped out by an early elimination
from the conference tournament when they lost to UC Santa Barbara in
the semifinals Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Coach Pat Douglass had a prophetic statement Thursday
night. "The mid-majors have a problem in that you go for four months
at a time, [then] you have to win three games to go to the
tournament," Douglass said. "Are we going to worry about the NCAA
bid, or are we going to take into account four months of hard work?"</TE>
<TE>   As unfair as it is, it makes the games more dramatic because each
team plays with more desperation. You didn't see that at Staples on
Thursday, when three of four games were blowouts.</TE>
<TE>   With UC Santa Barbara handling Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the
second half, I went to catch the end of the UCLA game on TV. This is
where the Big West tournament location beats the Pac-10: peripheral
entertainment options. For fans coming from out of town, especially
families, it's simply a better place to be. Disney's California
Adventure is across the street. And Downtown Disney is just down the
road.</TE>
<TE>   It might be prefabricated, but Downtown Disney beats downtown L.A.
You have a House of Blues, ESPNZone and a 12-screen movie multiplex
right there. With three hours' free parking. Try finding any of the
above in downtown L.A. They need to get that hotel and entertainment
complex around Staples out of the planning stages and start building.</TE>
<TE>   I was in my car for the duration of one song while I zipped over
to the SportsZone. Not only did they have the UCLA-Cal game, they
even managed to pull in the Big West game off the feed from a Santa
Barbara station. UCLA lost, and you could hear the Steve Lavin
criticism all the way in Anaheim. (Specifically, from the guy next to
me at the bar).</TE>
<TE>   After a long day of hoops, it was simply a matter of taking the 5
to the 91 to the 605 to the 105 to the 405 to the 90 to get home.
March Madness, indeed.</TE>

<HD>Two Brawls in First for Angels, Padres</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Aaron Sele lost his contact lenses. Troy Glaus got tackled from
behind, by a catcher. Shawn Wooten got his uniform top yanked off,
and got some bruises and a fat lip. Mickey Hatcher, the batting
coach, had blood dripping from beneath his right eye.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels were roughed up in two bench-clearing brawls during the
first inning of Saturday's 9-5 Cactus League loss to the San Diego
Padres. The Padres were roughed up too--Scott Spiezio threw a right
that connected with the face of San Diego coach Tim Flannery--as Sele
and the Padres' Ryan Klesko apparently settled a score that had
absolutely nothing to do with the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   With two out in the first inning, Sele hit Klesko in the lower
back with  the first pitch. Klesko immediately threw off his helmet,
charged the mound, grabbed Sele by the head and threw him to the
ground. Klesko was ejected. The next batter, Phil Nevin, hit a home
run.</LD>
<TE>   In the bottom of the inning, on the first pitch to Glaus, the
Padres' Bobby Jones backed him away with an off-speed pitch. On the
third pitch, Jones came in high and tight with a fastball, and Glaus
charged the mound. San Diego catcher Adan Amezcua tackled him before
he could get there, but the second melee was on, this one resulting
in the ejections of Glaus, Spiezio, Jones, Nevin and Padre Manager
Bruce Bochy.</TE>
<TE>   Klesko said he knew this day was coming since last June, when he
hit a home run off Sele, then pitching for the Seattle Mariners.
According to Klesko, Sele took exception to perceived showboating,
refused to discuss the issue after the game and told Nevin that he
would hit Klesko the next time he faced him.</TE>
<TE>   Sele said he could not recall such a conversation with either
Klesko or Nevin and denied any intent to hit Klesko.</TE>
<TE>   "It was obvious," Klesko said. "First pitch the next time I see
him, and he hits me in the back. What was I supposed to do? Go to
first?"</TE>
<TE>   Despite the denial of intent, Sele did not appear upset in the
least that Klesko charged the mound.</TE>
<TE>   "If he thought I was throwing at him, he was doing the right
thing," Sele said.</TE>
<TE>   Klesko said the Padre players anticipated an incident in talking
before the game, and one Angel player said he did too. Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia said he "didn't know of any history" and said he was
"absolutely shocked" when Klesko charged the mound. When Scioscia
tried to tell Klesko he was not hit on purpose, Klesko waved him off.</TE>
<TE>   "How does he know?" Klesko said. "He just picked up the guy [this
season]."</TE>
<TE>   Klesko acknowledged his flair sometimes incites ire in opposing
pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes maybe I do deserve it," he said. "I gave him a chance
last year to talk about it. He didn't want to. He wanted to hit me."</TE>
<TE>   In Act Two, Jones nearly hit Glaus twice, the second time with a
pitch that appeared to violate the unwritten rule that revenge is
exacted with pitches below the neck.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't take liberties when people start throwing at your
head," Glaus said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jones: "I will protect my hitters. I wanted to throw one in,
but I didn't want to throw one high. I didn't want to hit him, and I
didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Spiezio was enraged.</TE>
<TE>   "Klesko retaliated, Nevin hits a home run, and that's not enough?
They try to hit him once, and then they throw at his head? That's off
limits."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio was so angry he threw a few punches, which led to his
ejection and to some disgust in the San Diego clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got nothing wrong with what Aaron did," Nevin said. "He
backed up his words.... I've got no problem with what Troy did.
Anybody comes up and in like that on me, I'm going to do the same
thing he did. I've got no problem with what Ryan did.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a problem with what a couple of their players did. When
guys are throwing cheap shots, they need to be taught a lesson.
There's a couple of guys over there that need to be taught a lesson,
one guy in particular."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio? "That's a pretty good guess," Nevin said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels and Padres, who play again Wednesday, do not meet in
the regular season.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The big redhead was in the third row, just another Arizona fan
wearing a big red T-shirt. And by game's end, a huge smile.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Walton stepped out of the Fox Sports Net broadcasting booth
and spent the afternoon cheering on his son, Luke, and the rest of
the Wildcats in the Pacific 10 Conference final at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The younger Walton's performance was a lot like the music of the
family's favorite band, the Grateful Dead. It meandered along
seemingly without focus before gathering steam and finishing with an
extended jam that rocked the house.</LD>
<TE>   The junior forward missed nine of 13 shots and had zero assists in
the first half, which ended with Arizona trailing by eight points.</TE>
<TE>   But in the second half he had eight assists, made seven of seven
free throws and scored 13 of his 23 points as Arizona outscored USC
by 18 and raced to an 81-71 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Walton, who played all 40 minutes, was named tournament most
valuable player and led off the net-cutting ceremony, an honor Coach
Lute Olson said he richly deserved.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a guy with an unbelievable feel for the game," he said.
"What Luke does you don't teach. His reactions are in his genes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman guard Salim Stoudamire was considered a can't-miss
prospect out of Lake Oswego, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   And he almost couldn't miss in this game.</TE>
<TE>   The cousin of former Wildcat star Damon Stoudamire made nine of 10
shots and six of six free throws, leading all scorers with 29 points.
He scored eight points in a row early in the second half when Arizona
erased a deficit and seized control of the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winning the championship did not soften Olson's stance against
holding the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to cut back on the number of conference games," he said.
"Us and USC played 21 games against conference opponents. That's too
many.</TE>
<TE>   "The administrators have to ask themselves, do they have
student-athletes' best interest at heart?"</TE>

<HD>Red Sox Add Alou to List of Candidates</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Batting third in the lineup of Boston Red Sox managerial candidates
was former Montreal manager Felipe Alou, who interviewed for the job
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Red Sox officials whisked Alou to an undisclosed location shortly
after he arrived at the team's Fort Myers, Fla., spring training
camp. No decision was expected until Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The Red Sox also have interviewed Cleveland coach Grady Little and
Boston coach Mike Cubbage.</LD>
<TE>   "Whoever comes over is fine, but there's no doubt that I have the
experience of playing for Felipe," said Boston pitcher Pedro
Martinez, who played for Alou at Montreal. "At that time, he proved
to me that he could be the best manager in baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Alou turned down the Boston manager's job when Jimy Williams was
fired last year. Alou managed the Expos from 1992 until he was fired
last May.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Needing to fill the void left by Tom Gordon's shoulder injury, the
Chicago Cubs hope to close a deal with free agent Jeff Shaw, the
former Dodger closer.</TE>
<TE>   "I've already talked to Jeff. He has said he would like to
consider it," agent Joe Bick said. "I think we'll know if it's going
to fly within a day or two."</TE>
<TE>   Andy MacPhail, the Cubs' general manager, said he probably would
know by Monday or Tuesday whether there's a deal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>UCSB Lines Up NCAA Bid</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even in its heyday a decade ago, when Brian Shaw, Carrick DeHart and
Eric McArthur regularly had the Thunderdome rocking and 20-win
seasons were a common occurrence, UC Santa Barbara never won a Big
West Conference tournament championship.</LD>
<LD>   Remarkably, the Gauchos hadn't reached a tournament final until
Saturday night. Back then, the conference hurdles to clear were
usually Nevada Las Vegas and New Mexico State.</LD>
<LD>   Utah State is now the team other Big West schools need to get
past, and on this night the Gauchos found a way to do just that. They
laid it on the line, making clutch free throws in the final seconds
to win the Big West title game, 60-56, and secure their first NCAA
tournament berth in 12 years.</LD>
<TE>   Before this season the Aggies had won consecutive tournament
titles and three of four. And after a slow start Saturday night in
front of 3,020 at the Anaheim Convention Center, they rallied in the
second half in pursuit of their ninth consecutive tournament-game
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve forward Mike Ahmad, a Glendora native, scored eight
consecutive points in a 12-0 run to give Utah State a 46-43 lead with
10:46 remaining at press time. Ahmad, who averages only 3.2 points,
took control inside while Santa Barbara went into a shooting slump
for more than five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But Santa Barbara proved a worthy foe. Despite losing both
regular-season meetings, the Gauchos were at the top of their game at
the outset. Branduinn Fullove scored seven points in the first eight
minutes. Nick Jones and Mark Hull, the team's other top scorers, were
able to make shots from the outside. Freshman walk-on Chrismen Oliver
chipped in two baskets off the bench, while role players Mike
Vukovich and Bray Skaltety provided valuable minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Utah State has won 78 games the last three seasons and it showed
why in the final minutes before intermission as the Aggies went on an
8-0 run keyed by Toraino Johnson's two baskets and Desmond Penigar's
15-foot jumper.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Gauchos led, 36-32, at halftime. They targeted their
defense toward Utah State senior guard Tony Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, a first-team All-Big West selection, had a career-high 29
points in the Aggies' semifinal victory Friday over Pacific. Santa
Barbara sent two players at him throughout the half and he made only
one of four shot attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara put itself in position for a postseason berth for
the first time since the 1992-93 season. The Gauchos' last trip to
the NCAA tournament was in 1990 when DeHart and McArthur led them to
a 21-9 season and a first-round victory over Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Williams, in his fourth season as coach, has slowly rebuilt
the program after it began to flounder in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos earned their 19th victory--their most in 10
seasons--by defeating UC Irvine, 66-61, in the Big West semifinals
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable," said sophomore guard Jacoby Atako, whose free
throws and key defensive play on Jerry Green finished off the
Anteaters. "We felt we kind of underachieved this year and to finally
beat UC Irvine was big."</TE>
<TE>   Beating Utah State was even bigger.</TE>

<HD>Gauchos Find Trail to Another Title</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Pacific forward Nancy Dinges made a three-point basket to give
her team a two-point halftime lead over UC Santa Barbara on Saturday,
the Gauchos had to figure they had the Tigers right where they wanted
them.</LD>
<LD>   After all, in each of the teams' last five meetings, Santa Barbara
trailed at halftime and came back to win.</LD>
<LD>   "I was somewhat hoping we didn't score a three-pointer at the
buzzer and go ahead," Santa Barbara Coach Mark French said.</LD>
<TE>   Sure enough, despite Pacific's best efforts, Santa Barbara (25-5)
overtook the Tigers halfway through the second half and went on to a
64-53 victory before 1,145 at the Anaheim Convention Center. It was
the Gauchos' sixth consecutive Big West tournament title and their
21st consecutive victory this season. Their last loss was on Dec. 30
to Nevada Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Guided by conference player of the year Kayte Christensen (14
points, eight rebounds)--"the best player I've had to combine a
fierce desire with a great work ethic," French said--and tournament
MVP Lindsay Taylor (12 points, eight rebounds), Santa Barbara claimed
the conference's automatic NCAA tournament berth.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a great championship game," French said.
"Pacific did a terrific job. Their defense was absolutely superb."</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers (19-11) were especially effective in the first half,
when they harassed the Gauchos into missing 20 of 28 shots and were
outrebounded by only 17-16. But all that got them was the two-point
halftime lead, which didn't exactly frighten Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't think it would get worse, and hopefully it would get
better," French said.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half Santa Barbara shot 48.3% (14 for 29) and forced
Pacific into critical turnovers. When Kristen Mann drove for a layup
with 10:31 to play, Santa Barbara went ahead, 38-36. The Tigers never
caught up after that. The closest they could get was 46-45 on a
three-pointer by Dinges, but the turnovers (20) prevented them from
recapturing the momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Christensen, a senior, is eager to see how far the Gauchos can go.</TE>
<TE>   "Our team chemistry is better than any other team I've played on
here," she said. "That's going to be important come NCAA tournament
time."</TE>
<TE>   Pacific, which was led by Dinges' 12 points, must hope some
tournament's selection committee will give it a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the NIT people were watching," Tiger Coach Sherri Murrell
said. "We had a 25-5 team on the ropes. I don't think they were
thinking they could cruise past Pacific. So I really hope the NIT was
watching. We deserve it."</TE>

<LD>This time, Marvin Lea refused to allow Riverside King to lose.</LD>
<LD>   The senior guard scored 11 of his 32 points in the fourth quarter
to help the Wolves avenge their biggest loss of the season and knock
Redondo Union out of the state playoffs with a 66-57 victory in a
Southern California Regional Division II boys' basketball semifinal
Saturday night at Redondo.</LD>
<LD>   "I wasn't going to let my team come this far and lose," said Lea,
who also led King with 11 rebounds, three assists and two steals.</LD>
<TE>   Forward Leon Rosborough scored 18 points, including five
three-point baskets, for King (29-4), which will play Santa Ana Mater
Dei in the regional final at 4 p.m. Saturday at Long Beach Arena.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolves had lost to Redondo, 71-70, last week in the Southern
Section Division II-A final on Wendell White's last-second
three-point basket. But there were no late heroics for the Sea Hawks
(24-7) in the rematch.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Ellison led Redondo with 25 points and forward Adam Zahn had
11 points and 14 rebounds. White, in foul trouble, finished with
eight points.</TE>

<TE>   Mater Dei (29-4) led by two points after a competitive first half,
but Mike Strawberry hit a jumper on the opening possession of the
third quarter and Trevante Nelson followed with a three-pointer to
put the Monarchs ahead, 41-34.</TE>
<TE>   Six players scored in double figures for Mater Dei, led by Wesley
Washington with 19 points and Mike Strawberry with 18 points. Duwan

<TE>   Fred Washington had 23 points and Brandon Peace had 15 to lead
Bishop Montgomery (27-6), the defending state champions. The Knights
will play Compton Centennial in a regional final at noon Saturday at
Long Beach Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Montgomery, which lead at halftime, 26-24, opened its lead
to 57-37 midway through the fourth quarter.</TE>

<LD>The Clippers find themselves in the unusual position of entering the
season's final 20 games with something more to play for than pride.
Gone are the days of simply playing out the season while padding
individual scoring averages.</LD>
<LD>   "It should be kind of fun feeling this kind of pressure," Coach
Alvin Gentry said. "If you come away with a win, it really means
something. We're not just playing for pride. We did that last year
and the guys did a pretty good job. We don't want to do that anymore.
Just like we don't want to visit the lottery anymore."</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers desperately want to make the playoffs, but they were
ninth in the Western Conference standings and 31/2 games out of a
postseason spot after defeating the Chicago Bulls on Friday. Their
four-game trip continues today against the Cavaliers at Cleveland.</LD>
<TE>   "All the games are critical at this point," Gentry said. "It's a
monumental task, but we haven't given up. Our goal since the
beginning of the season has been to make the playoffs. Something will
work out for us if we keep winning games."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have won four of five. Their next victory will top
last season's total of 31, which was 16 better than they had in
1999-2000--the NBA's biggest improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just got to keep playing hard," said center Michael
Olowokandi, who had a career-best 30 points Friday against the Bulls.
"We can't sit back and relax. We don't have the luxury of experience.
That's a big deal, especially playing against these other teams."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were the league's youngest team with an average age
of 24.8 on opening night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers committed only 10 fouls Friday against the Bulls,
which led to a 25-9 disparity in free throws. Elton Brand, who had
five, Jeff McInnis (three) and Quentin Richardson (two) were the only
Clippers to draw fouls.</TE>

game between rookies and second-season players during the All-Star
break last month. Mihm is not expected to play today, but he could

<HD>Hoffman Says No to Boston</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JUPITER, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The position may have been plum, but the situation and timing weren't
right for Dodger third-base coach Glenn Hoffman, who was granted
permission to interview for the Boston Red Sox's manager job Saturday
afternoon but withdrew his name from consideration a few hours later.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an honor to be considered, but I withdrew because of what's
going on here," Hoffman said. "There are a lot of good things going
on, and I couldn't leave. I didn't want to string [the Red Sox] on. I
wanted to be up front."</LD>
<LD>   Hoffman, 43, who was contacted by new Boston owner John Henry on
Saturday, didn't want to elaborate, but it was clear the uncertainty
surrounding the Red Sox and a reluctance to move his wife and five
kids across the country were factors.</LD>
<TE>   "It's no knock on Boston, but it's an unstable situation there,"
Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "There are a lot of interim tags, and
[Hoffman] is concerned about that. He's experienced a similar
situation here, coming in midstream. You'd like to bring in your own
people, but that's difficult to do with three weeks before opening
day."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman replaced the fired Bill Russell as Dodger manager on June
21, 1998, and guided what many considered a weak Dodger team to a
47-41 record the rest of the season. But the Dodgers were sold to
Fox, Kevin Malone replaced Tom Lasorda as general manager, and Malone
hired Davey Johnson as manager.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman, who interviewed for the Dodger job before Tracy was
hired, aspires to be a big league manager, and he didn't think
Saturday's rejection would damage his chances.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a great opportunity for someone to show interest and to
get my name out there," Hoffman said. "But with three weeks to go
before the season, if I'm not jumping in there 100% committed, it
wouldn't be fair to them or us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It has been 20 years since a Dodger donned Steve Garvey's No. 6,
but not only is Dante Bichette wearing the number this spring, he
started at first base in the Dodgers' 8-1 exhibition win over the
Montreal Expos on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got fairly big forearms," Bichette said, "but not quite that
big."</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Dodger fans and Garvey loyalists cringe at the thought of
another Dodger wearing No. 6, but hold off on those letters of
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a big number to fill, but I probably won't," Bichette
said. "That's what was in my locker when I got here, but if I make
the team, I'll probably get another number. The last thing I want to
do is tick off Dodger fans."</TE>
<TE>   Bichette, an outfielder by trade, has never played first base in a
regular-season game, and he had to borrow a first baseman's mitt--it
was actually an old Angel Echevarria glove--from teammate Phil Hiatt.
If Bichette is capable at first--he really wasn't tested Saturday
night--that would improve Tracy's bench flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cesar Izturis, the favorite to win the shortstop job, had an RBI
triple, two singles and two stolen bases Saturday night, giving him
six hits, including a home run, in the Dodgers' last two exhibition
games. Marquis Grissom had three hits, and Dave Roberts had three
runs batted in.... Center fielder Tom Goodwin, sidelined by a
strained oblique muscle, swung off a tee and took soft toss Saturday
and hopes to return to action early this week. Second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek, sidelined by a sore right hamstring, continued to
improve, and Tracy expects him to play in his first exhibition game
in the next few days.... According to ESPN's Peter Gammons, the
Dodgers recently tried to get a scout from another team interested in
reliever Mike Trombley. "Sorry," the scout told Dodger GM Dan Evans,
"our [radar] gun can't measure fastballs below 84 mph."</TE>

<HD>Shields' Strong Play Keeps Him in Lineup</HD>

<LD>All goalie Steve Shields can control is what is in his power to
control. At the moment, he has a chokehold on the Mighty Ducks'
goalie situation.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Bryan Murray had an easy time deciding who would start in
goal for the Ducks tonight against Ottawa. Shields was exceptional
Friday in a 2-1 victory over New Jersey. He stopped 44 of 45 shots,
including all 19 in the first period.</LD>
<LD>   It gave Shields back-to-back victories for the first time this
season, as he stopped 21 of 22 shots in a 4-1 victory over Atlanta on
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "He's played really well and it's what we want to do ... just
win," Murray said. "It's not his fault, but I said early in the year
if you win, we'll come back with you."</TE>
<TE>   And that has been out of Shields' control most games. The Ducks
have scored more than two goals in only five of his 26 starts. That
has helped make Shields' numbers average. He has a 2.79 goals-against
average and .905 save percentage</TE>
<TE>   "There were chances where I could have had the opportunity to play
and didn't," Shields said. "That's fine. Things always work out for
me. I'm not too concerned about it. The best thing always happens to
me. That's what I believe and that's what I make happen."</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Sebastien Giguere has had the lion's share of playing time,
even after he lost games. Murray said that Giguere's play kept him in
the lineup. Giguere ranks among the NHL leaders with a 2.19
goals-against average and .917 save percentage.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Atlanta start, Shields had five starts in the previous
21 games. Tonight is the first time he will have started three
consecutive games since playing the first five games of the season,
when Giguere was injured.</TE>
<TE>   "The more you play, the more comfortable you are and the easier it
seems," Shields said. "I could play every game. If that was the
situation, I wouldn't mind that one bit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Andy McDonald, who has been out three games because of a
concussion, will return to the lineup tonight, Murray said. However,
he won't resume his role as the center on the Ducks' top line.</TE>
<TE>   Center Steve Rucchin has quickly returned to form after sitting
out 44 games because of a broken bone in his left ankle. He has
skated between Jeff Friesen and Paul Kariya and that line has
produced four goals in the last two games. Rucchin has four assists
in the last three games.</TE>

<DH>A look at the Trojans' lead or deficit by the minute.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First Half</LD>
<LD>   What Happened: USC unleashed a variety of presses that confused
and intimidated Arizona from the outset. During the first timeout
four minutes into the game, Wildcat forward Luke Walton angrily
called out his teammates, asking them if they were scared. USC
forward Jerry Dupree blocked four shots, the Trojans forced 10
first-half turnovers and held Arizona to 36.7% shooting. USC led by
13 after a layup by point guard Brandon Granville with 5:20 left in
the half, but Arizona clawed back. Keyed by forward Rick Anderson's
three-point basket and two free throws, the Wildcats scored 10 of the
next 14 points and pulled within 39-31 at the break.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   What You Won't Find in the Box Score: Fortune smiled on USC early
when Granville got his signals crossed and threw an alley-oop pass
with no one breaking to the basket. No matter, the pass went through
the hoop, giving the Trojans a 10-8 lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winning Number: The Trojans got balanced scoring, with six players
making either two or three field goals and all but Granville making
at least half their shots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wrong Number: Walton, who leads Arizona with a 6.3 assist average,
had zero. He also took 13 shots--six more than any other
Wildcat--making four.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leading Scorers: USC--David Bluthenthal 9, Desmon Farmer 8.
Arizona--Salim Stoudamire 11, Walton 10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leading Rebounders: USC--Dupree 4, Errick Craven 4.
Arizona--Anderson 5, Isaiah Fox 4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second Half</TE>
<TE>   What Happened: Arizona's stunning 50-32 second-half surge began
with Luke Walton's three-point play. Salim Stoudamire scored eight
points in a three-minute span and the Wildcats took the lead, 44-43,
on a basket by Rick Anderson. They quickly stretched the margin to
seven and USC made one fleeting counterpunch, pulling to within 56-54
on reserve center Rory O'Neil's only basket of the game with 7:15
left. Arizona went on a 13-5 run and led by at least six the rest of
the way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What You Won't Find in the Box Score: USC lost its legs and its
composure, forcing shots, turning over the ball and committing silly
fouls. Coach Henry Bibby also lost his poise at a crucial juncture,
drawing a technical foul for repeatedly berating official Charlie
Range with 1:50 to play and his team down by eight. Stoudamire made
both free throws.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winning Number: Walton bounced back from his poor first half,
passing for eight assists and making seven of seven free throws.
Stoudamire made all five of his shots and finished the game five for
six from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wrong Number: Conference most valuable player Sam Clancy of USC
made three of 10 shots, had only two rebounds and afterward
complained of Arizona's rough play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leading Scorers: Arizona--Stoudamire 18, Walton 13. USC--David
Bluthenthal 7, Desmon Farmer 7, Brandon Granville 7.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leading Rebounders: Arizona--Rick Anderson 4, Isaiah Fox 4,
Channing Frye 4. USC--Bluthenthal 5.</TE>

<LD>Redondo Union High found a way to do something few before it could:
stop the state's most prolific outside-shooting girls' basketball
team.</LD>
<LD>   The Sea Hawks used a match-up zone defense to tame a Ventura team
that had made a state-record 275 three-point shots, taking a 50-34
victory Saturday night in a Division II Southern California Regional
semifinal game at Ventura High.</LD>
<LD>   Jenni Dooley, who had made 106 three-pointers and was averaging
19.5 points for top-seeded Ventura, missed all 13 of her shots and
finished with one point. Katy O'Brien, who scored 61 points in her
previous two games, had nine points.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't believe we did that, to tell you the truth," said Coach
Marcello Enriquez of fourth-seeded Redondo (25-7), which advances to
the 2 p.m. regional final on Saturday at Long Beach Arena against
second-seeded Fullerton Troy (29-3), a 57-54 winner over Bakersfield
Stockdale.</TE>
<TE>   Ofa Tulikihihifo had 13 points and seven rebounds and Krista
Areyan added 10 points and seven rebounds for Redondo, the Southern
Section Division II-A champion. Freshman Caitlin O'Neill scored 13
points for Ventura (29-3), which made only 12 of 50 shots (six of 32
from three-point range) and saw its 18-game winning streak end.</TE>

<TE>   Wiley-Gatewood, a guard, scored a game-high 15 points, including
six in the final quarter. Rayford, a forward, finished with 14
points, including eight off offensive rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Knights used a 22-6 run to build a 30-12 lead early in the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Lynwood will play Harbor City Narbonne in a regional final at 6

before it pulled away. Thomas began the charge with one of her four
three-pointers as the Pioneers closed the quarter on a 12-0 run.</TE>
<TE>   Artesia (26-5) held University City without a field goal for a
five-minute span from late in the third quarter to early in the
fourth. Junior forward Cacie Pope added 13 points, seven rebounds and
three blocked shots, and junior guard Brittany Imaku had 10 points

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The greens were soft, the palm trees were steady and the TPC at Heron
Bay was perfect for scoring Saturday at Coral Springs, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Weir and Brett Wetterich were tied for the lead at 14-under
par when the third round of the Honda Classic was halted because of
darkness. Weir completed 10 holes and Wetterich 11.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to make birdies or you're going to get lapped," Weir
said.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty-five others, including Fred Couples and Phil Mickelson,
were within four strokes of the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "The winner may be outside of four shots," said Matt Kuchar, who
shot a six-under 66 to move to 13 under. "Everybody is in contention.
A lot of people will have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Play will resume today and the final round will start shortly
after the third round is completed.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy rain fell on the course Thursday, leaving dozens of players
with more than 18 holes to play Friday and Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The weather also left the course with soft greens that yielded
several low scores. Scoring was made even easier Saturday when Heron
Bay's lone defender--strong, steady wind--took a day off.</TE>
<TE>   Second-round leader John Riegger, Kuchar, rookie Stephen Gangluff
and 1988 Honda Classic champion Joey Sindelar were tied at 13 under.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchar and Gangluff (65) were among the 21 golfers who completed
the third round.</TE>
<TE>   Riegger had a share of the lead after eight holes, but his tee
shot on the tough, par-four No. 18 found the water. He bogeyed the
hole to fall a stroke behind the leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Weir, a left-handed Canadian, shot a 65 in the second round and
was one stroke behind Riegger as the third round began.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in the same group as Riegger, Weir took the lead after
consecutive birdies on Nos. 11 and 12.</TE>
<TE>   Riegger, winless in 115 tour events and still looking for his
first top-10 finish in five full seasons on the PGA Tour, pulled even
with a birdie at No. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Jesper Parnevik, 17-year-old Ty Tryon and
Southern sensation Boo Weekley missed the cut, which tied the
tournament record at four-under 140.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Els shot a five-under 67 to take a three-shot lead after the
third round of the Dubai Desert Classic at United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   Els had six birdies, including four on the back nine, and was
annoyed with a double-bogey five on No. 7. He had a 203 for three
rounds and Niclas Fasth was second at 206 following his third-round
69.</TE>

<HD>Frankel Counts on You for Victory in the Oaks</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer enjoys another first as 3-year-old
filly defeats Habibti by half-length at Santa Anita.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A week after he won his first Santa Anita Handicap with Milwaukee
Brew, trainer Bobby Frankel collected his initial Santa Anita Oaks
victory.</LD>
<LD>   You, the 4-5 favorite, took a 2-1 lead over Habibti in their
California rivalry with a half-length victory Saturday at Santa
Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Purchased privately by Frankel last summer for owner Ed Gann, the
3-year-old You And I filly was ridden perfectly by jockey Jerry
Bailey and won for the fifth time in eight starts.</LD>
<TE>   Well-positioned in the clear behind a moderate pace carved out by
Adoration and 55-1 shot Ile De France, You took the lead with about a
furlong to go and won in 1:42 3/5 for the 1 1/16 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Habibti, the 9-5 second choice who had beaten You in the Hollywood
Starlet in December before finishing second to her in the Las
Virgenes here last month, had no visible excuses, although trainer
Bob Baffert would beg to differ.</TE>
<TE>   He said jockey Victor Espinoza had the daughter of Tabasco Cat too
far back early, but she was only two lengths behind her rival after a
half-mile and a little more than a length behind the winner after six
furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   "The rider is going to give me a heart attack," said Baffert. "He
gives her too much to do. He had her too far back. You can't give You
a head start like that.</TE>
<TE>   "A filly like that, when they are that good, you've got to be
right there with her. You can't be three lengths behind her. You're
not going to close on her, a good filly like that."</TE>
<TE>   You, who began her career by winning a $50,000 maiden claimer at
Churchill Downs last June 1, earned her third Grade I score. Before
the Oaks, she had taken the Las Virgenes and the Frizette last fall
at Belmont Park. Her 60% share of Saturday's $300,000 purse boosted
her earnings to $840,440.</TE>
<TE>   "She has shown her versatility so far," said Bailey, who left
immediately after the race for New Orleans, where he will ride Repent
for the first time in today's Louisiana Derby at the Fair Grounds.
"She was a little further back, she rated nice and she beat the ones
she's been beating."</TE>
<TE>   Frankel and Baffert indicated the two fillies will get together
again, but it will be out of town. They will both be pointed toward
the Kentucky Oaks on May 3 at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Ile De France saved third by a nose over 35-1 shot Farda Amiga,
then came Respectful, Daddy's Gold, Dancing, Adoration, the 8-1 third
choice and Lady George.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bosque Redondo, the 2-1 second choice, led from start to finish
and won the $101,850 Tokyo City Handicap at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Chris McCarron for owner-breeders John Toffan and Trudy
McCaffery and trainer Paco Gonzalez, the 5-year-old Mane Minister
horse prevailed by a head over 6-5 favorite Reba's Gold.</TE>
<TE>   In earning his fifth win in 12 starts, Bosque Redondo completed
the mile in 1:35 2/5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dream Run ($10.40) rallied on the outside to capture the $200,000
Gulfstream Park Breeders' Cup Sprint Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Pat Day for owner J.D. Murphy and trainer Paul McGee,
the 4-year-old Cherokee Run colt won for the third time in five races
at Gulfstream Park. He ran the seven furlongs in 1:22 1/5.</TE>
<TE>   Binthebest was second and Burning Roma third in a race where 11-10
favorite Hook And Ladder finished last in the field of eight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winless in three starts since shocking Officer in the California
Cup Juvenile Nov. 3 at Santa Anita, Yougottawanna surprised favored

choice in the field of 10.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of the Gold Rush and Golden Gate Derby in two previous

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>If the Kings are unable to swing a deal before the March 19 trade
deadline, Andy Murray will gladly move forward with the current
lineup.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, we'd love to make an addition or two," the King coach
said of General Manager Dave Taylor's pursuit of a high-scoring
forward, "but if it doesn't work ... this is a team that in the last
three months has played at a pace with the top teams in the league,
and most of December we didn't have Ziggy [Palffy] and Mathieu
[Schneider, sidelined because of injuries].</LD>
<LD>   "We might not be the most talented team in the league, but we've
proven that with solid work we can beat anybody. Our record indicates
that. And we've proven that we can win in the other team's rink too."</LD>
<TE>   The Kings have accumulated 41 of their 73 points on the road.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's game against the Colorado Avalanche began a stretch of
17 in a row against teams still in the playoff chase. All but the
Pittsburgh Penguins, the Kings' opponent next Saturday, have records
above .500.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much parity in this league that you can't afford to
take anybody lightly," Murray said. "Did we take Columbus lightly a
week ago [in a 2-0 loss March 2 at Staples Center]? I don't know. We
outshot them badly, but were we as good as we needed to be? Probably
not, and as a result, we lost."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Buchberger left Saturday's game after suffering a sprained
right ankle in a first-period collision with Ville Nieminen of the
Avalanche. "I just went to hit him and got tangled up," Buchberger
said, limping toward the bus after the game. "Actually, my foot got
into the [seam between the ice and the boards] a little weird." ...
Steve Heinze, who has not scored a goal in his last 18 games,
returned to the lineup after being benched Thursday night.</TE>

<DH>Hockey: Norstrom's turnover in third period helps Avalanche
rally to 4-3 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Colorado Avalanche was playing its ninth consecutive home game,
the Kings their fourth game in four cities in six days.</LD>
<LD>   But this was no mismatch.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the Kings had the upper hand Saturday in the Pepsi
Center, leading by a goal late in the third period and seemingly on
the verge of adding another eye-opening victory to one of the NHL's
most impressive road records.</LD>
<TE>   But after the Avalanche won, 4-3, it became apparent that there
are reasons why it is the defending Stanley Cup champion and the
Kings are a step behind, one being that the Avalanche packs a
stronger finishing kick.</TE>
<TE>   A goal by Mike Keane, following a turnover by King defenseman
Mattias Norstrom, wiped out the King lead with 6:53 to play, and
Ville Nieminen scored the winner with 1:09 left in front of 18,007.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a tough ending to the game," said Norstrom after the Kings
had lost in regulation for only the fifth time in 26 road games since
the end of October. "We've been spoiled with playing well on the
road....</TE>
<TE>   "This is not what we really wanted out of this game. We go home
from the road trip with a .500 record, but it could have been a lot
better."</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche scored its first goal shorthanded, its second after
a turnover by King defenseman Mathieu Schneider, and then tied the
score after Joe Sakic, playing in his 1,000th game, stepped in front
of a pass by Norstrom in the King zone.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll create enough chances on their own," King Coach Andy
Murray said of the opportunistic Avalanche. "We don't have to give
them to them."</TE>
<TE>   Sakic's interception led to a shot by the Avalanche captain that
was stopped by goaltender Felix Potvin, but the rebound bounced to
Keane, who took the puck wide before sweeping it into the net.</TE>
<TE>   On the winner, the Avalanche got lucky, defenseman Rob Blake's
shot from the right circle bouncing off Nieminen's right skate into
the net.</TE>
<TE>   It was similar to a second-period goal by Adam Deadmarsh, whose
left skate got in the way of a shot by Jason Allison and redirected
the puck between the legs of goaltender Patrick Roy.</TE>
<TE>   The goal was the second of the game for Deadmarsh, who scored
unassisted in the first period after stripping the puck from
defenseman Adam Foote.</TE>
<TE>   The goals gave the former Avalanche right wing a team-high 25,
seven in seven games since the U.S. Olympian returned from Salt Lake
City.</TE>
<TE>   Allison scored the Kings' third goal, giving the burly center 12
points since the Olympic break and putting the Kings ahead, 3-2, with
19:26 to play. Deadmarsh and Ziggy Palffy assisted on the goal, and
the line of Allison, Deadmarsh and Palffy has 31 points since the
Olympic break.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for the Kings is, theirs is the only productive line.
During the same period, the No. 2 line of Bryan Smolinski, Craig
Johnson and either Steve Heinze or Nelson Emerson has contributed two
points.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get production from everyone," Schneider said.
"We're relying so heavily on Ally's line. We need other guys,
including defensemen, to step up and get offense for us. It's only
going to make things easier for us."</TE>
<TE>   Taking care of the puck in their zone would help too, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "That was just a poor play on my part," Norstrom said of Sakic's
game-turning interception. "He read it right. I tried to hit the guy
up the middle and he picked it off; [it was] just a poor decision on
my part.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where he came from. I didn't see him. Otherwise, I
wouldn't have made the play. I've just got to make a better decision
with 8-10 minutes to go in the game, make a safer play than that."</TE>
<TE>   Having squandered a 2-0 third-period lead Thursday night against
the Nashville Predators before winning, 3-2, on a goal by Deadmarsh
with 13 seconds to play, the Kings again got careless against the
Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a team down, 3-2, in the third, you've got to finish them
off," Schneider said. "We've had trouble hanging onto leads the last
few games. We've got to get more consistent in that department.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a tendency to sit back a little too much. We're sitting
on leads and causing ourselves a lot of trouble. We've got to keep
the same aggressive style of play."</TE>

<HD>At Practice, Jackson Doesn't Just Sit There</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Exactly what does Phil Jackson do?</LD>
<LD>   Those who ask that question see the Laker coach only under game
conditions, usually seated, normally under control, appearing at
times as uninvolved in the decision making as Jack Nicholson.</LD>
<LD>   It's a question that would never be asked by anyone who has seen
Jackson cracking the whip in practice, or agonizing over decisions.</LD>
<TE>   Even with Michael Jordan, or Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, you
don't win eight NBA titles, as has Jackson, without being heavily
involved.</TE>
<TE>   He was heavily involved at practice Saturday at the HealthSouth
Training Center in El Segundo, barking out orders, yelling when a
screen wasn't properly set.</TE>
<TE>   With the playoffs only a month away, has he begun bearing down on
his troops for the final push?</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a little early for that," he said with a smile. "I
don't know if their attention span is long enough to cover the next
three months--April, May and June--and also to do it in March."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is still kicking himself for his decision to pass up a
morning shoot-around Wednesday. It seemed logical at the time. The
Lakers had played at Staples Center Tuesday night, then immediately
flown to Salt Lake City. Tipoff Wednesday was 6 p.m. So Jackson let
his players sleep in and skip an 11 a.m. shoot-around.</TE>
<TE>   "It showed in the first half," Jackson said. "We had 14 turnovers.
If I had gotten them out of bed after about six hours of sleep for a
shoot-around, they might have been a little sharper."</TE>
<TE>   For once, Jackson agreed with his critics. He didn't do enough.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Power forward Samaki Walker, who has been out 10 games because of
a hyperextended right elbow, will miss an 11th, sitting out today's
game against the New York Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Brian Shaw, who sat out Wednesday's game after bruising his
right shoulder the night before against the New Jersey Nets, says he
could play today. "For the amount of time he [Jackson] plays me,"
said Shaw, averaging 9.7 minutes, "I'm available."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY</TE>
<TE>   vs. New York, 3 p.m., Channel 4</TE>
<TE>   Site--Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 42-18, Knicks 23-37.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Knicks--1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--When the Lakers played the Knicks on Feb. 24 at Madison
Square Garden, the problem for onlookers was staying awake. That was
also the Lakers' problem, but they proved they are good enough to
sleepwalk and still beat a bad team. Little has changed. The Lakers
are the Lakers. And the Knicks are horrible, last in the Atlantic
Division and losers of seven of their last 10 and 21 of 28 overall on
the road, including seven of nine on the home courts of Western
Conference teams.</TE>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Lou Kelly's last-second fling from half court put a fitting finish to
a wild three days of basketball in the Mountain West, a conference
tournament that produced the wildest of results here Saturday night:
San Diego State is going to the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly, one of the stars of a Nevada Las Vegas team that rode a
nice home-court advantage and a great run of hot shooting and pesky
defense into the final, got the ball near half court with time nearly
elapsed and his Runnin' Rebels trailing, 78-75. He let it fly in time
to beat the clock, and it soared toward the basket.</LD>
<LD>   There were few in the near sellout crowd of 14,347 at Thomas and
Mack who didn't believe the shot could fall. After all, this had been
a three-day event that had two overtime games and a thrill a minute,
with only one of the seven games being won by more than 10 points.</LD>
<TE>   So when Kelly's fling hit the back of the rim, meaning it missed
by perhaps an inch, all that was left was for everybody in the place
to sit for a minute or two in amazement as the San Diego State fans
stormed the court in celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly's shot may have been the last of his career, depending on
whether UNLV gets an NIT bid. The senior from San Bernardino Cajon
High said it looked good the minute he let it fly.</TE>
<TE>   "I made one like that in high school, so I was ready." he said. "I
wasn't going to celebrate because I was just thinking about overtime.
At least, this way, I go out the way I wanted to, with the ball in my
hands."</TE>
<TE>   Before this tournament, San Diego State probably wanted to go out
in a similar regard, with a good effort and heads held high. The
automatic NCAA bid was certainly incentive, but for a team that
hasn't been in the NCAA event since 1985 and had been 0-14 in the
conference only two years ago, the middle-of-the-pack 7-7 Mountain
West record the Aztecs brought here should have presented limited
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   But when Coach Steve Fisher's team took control early Saturday
night, behind the inside play of senior Randy Holcomb, they did,
indeed, look like an NCAA caliber team. But it wasn't until Deandre
Moore sank two free throws with 3.3 seconds left that San Diego State
finally shook a UNLV team that just wouldn't go away.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State's tournament win, giving the veteran Fisher a
longshot chance to win a second NCAA title to go with the one he took
at Michigan in 1989, presented an interesting dilemma for the NCAA's
selection committee today. It meant that there are three Mountain
West teams with a legitimate claim at a berth. Besides San Diego
State, regular-season champion Wyoming and perennial-powerhouse Utah,
both 21-8, have earned a long look from NCAA decision-makers.</TE>

<HD>Narbonne Gets Final Pass</HD>
<DH>Girls' basketball: Gauchos use size to defeat Long Beach
Poly and will play Lynwood in regional final.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conflicting styles matched up Saturday at Harbor City Narbonne, where
an overflow crowd gathered to watch two of the most highly regarded
teams in the country.</LD>
<LD>   The bruising style of Narbonne--the two-time defending state
champion--proved to be too much for the quickness of Long Beach Poly,
as Narbonne scored a 58-52 victory in a Southern California Regional
semifinal.</LD>
<LD>   Narbonne (27-3), ranked No. 9 in the nation by one ranking
organization, will play No. 1 Lynwood, a 58-29 winner against
Oceanside El Camino, at 6 p.m. Saturday at Long Beach Arena. The
winner will advance to the state championship game.</LD>
<TE>   Poly (33-2), ranked No. 10 in the nation, has lost to only
Narbonne and Lynwood.</TE>
<TE>   Narbonne's size--four players are 6 feet or taller--gave the
Gauchos control of the backboards; they outrebounded Poly, 45-27,
which helped overcome 28 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "Size was definitely a factor," said Carl Buggs, Poly's coach. "We
had about 10 shots within five feet and didn't knock them down. I
don't know if it was big-game jitters or not."</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Camille LeNoir scored 16 and junior Jamie Funn had 15
for Narbonne, which was able to slow Poly's uptempo style.</TE>
<TE>   Poly trailed, 52-43, with 3:27 left, but Narbonne made six of
eight free throws down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "The third quarter was real important," James Anderson, Narbonne's
coach, said, referring to a 13-4 run that began with 2:01 left in the
third and carried into the fourth that gave Narbonne a 51-34 lead
with 6:38 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Poly got only two rebounds in the third quarter and, trailing at
halftime, 26-19, went into the fourth down, 44-34, despite eight
Narbonne turnovers in the third.</TE>
<TE>   LeNoir scored the first six points of decisive flurry, igniting it
with a 17-foot basket and a steal and layup 12 seconds later.</TE>
<TE>   "You haven't seen what she can really do because we've been
holding her back," Anderson said of his point guard. "Next year,
we'll let her go."</TE>
<TE>   The run essentially secured the victory. "We had to work so hard
to get back," Buggs said. "Fatigue set in."</TE>

<LD>George McCloud scored 26 points and Voshon Lenard scored seven of his
14 points in overtime, and the Denver Nuggets defeated Portland,
109-106, Saturday night at Denver to end the Trail Blazers' 12-game
winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   Juwan Howard had 18 points and 12 rebounds for the Nuggets, who

<TE>   A three-pointer by Lenard and a short jumper by Hardaway gave the
Nuggets a 102-97 lead with 3:35 left in overtime. Bonzi Wells, who
scored 21 points, made a jumper, but Howard countered with a basket
that gave Denver a 104-99 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Pippen made four consecutive free throws to tie the score,
104-104, with 1:01 left. Lenard made two free throws and, after Wells
missed a jumper, Donnell Harvey sealed the victory by making two free
throws with 6.1 seconds left.</TE>

<TE>   The 76ers, who moved four games over .500 for the first time this
season, pulled away with a 22-6 run at the start of the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, the league's scoring leader, can't help thinking about
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing now is to get in," Iverson said.
"Regardless of everything else, we need to get in. Once we get in, I
think everything will take care of itself."</TE>

streak to five games. San Antonio outrebounded the Bulls, 48-34.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Age Against the Machine</HD>
<DH>NBA Establishment May Resent Bryant, but He's Still
Growing, and He Usually Gets It Right, Eventually</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"You forget about this guy's being a 23-year-old man ... in a
position in his life that not too many guys in this NBA have been
in."</LD>
<LD>   --Phil Jackson</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Growing up is very hard to do (continued): Controversy came
looking for Kobe Bryant again, as it seems to about every two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Never before has there been an NBA star who tried so hard to do
the right thing, accomplished as much as fast, while, at the same
time, bringing so much down on himself.</TE>
<TE>   At 23, he's a six-year veteran with two NBA titles, an All-Star
MVP award and a dunking title, and has started every All-Star game
since his rookie season. He makes $12.4 million a year and almost as
much in endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   Not that he's totally unaffected, but he's still as nice as nice
can be, one of the Lakers who'll smile and say hello if you pass him
in the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Kids everywhere identify with him, which explains his marketing
clout, but within the league he isn't as popular. Shaquille O'Neal,
who may or may not say hello, is adored by peers because when he's
not running them over, he's unpretentious, outgoing and fun-loving.
If he beats his chest, they understand: He's Shaq. It ain't bragging
if it's fact, or faq.</TE>
<TE>   But a lot of NBA people and, of course, Philadelphians see Bryant
as a me-first player, although he's changed dramatically this season.</TE>
<TE>   There's a backlash from his commercial exposure and, who knows,
those spots showing him riding a motorcycle into Staples and
swaggering off in black leather might not go over that well. The word
"arrogant" comes up, although we're still waiting for the first NBA
superstar who was known for his humility.</TE>
<TE>   There's talk that he has changed this season ... and in fact, he
has.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived in the NBA as a child, if a precocious one. Away from
the game, he was totally a creature of his family. He lived with them
in Pacific Palisades for his first two seasons, like "Ozzie and
Harriet." There were Dad, Mom, Ricky and, instead of an older
brother, two older sisters. Ricky might have been a rock star but at
home, he was just Ricky.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant had been regimented, not in the Todd Marinovich sense, at a
parent's direction, but in the Kobe sense, at his own. He couldn't do
enough. He played high school ball, summer ball, pickup ball, studied
videotape, practiced with the 76ers, lifted weights with a personal
trainer. Teenage rebellion never came up; he couldn't squeeze it in.</TE>
<TE>   Because his father was a former NBA player, everyone thought Kobe
was a little Joe. Kobe might have inherited his dad's talent and
flair but Joe, nicknamed Jellybean, was carefree and fun-loving. Kobe
was more like his mom, Pam, low-key but determined.</TE>
<TE>   Or as Del Harris, who had to break in the greatest prospect the
NBA had ever seen but not the most clued-in, while trying to win a
title, later said:</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine anyone calling Kobe 'Jellybean.'"</TE>
<TE>   At 17, Bryant decided to trade the rest of his teen years for a
career. It would be a long time before he would begin to
acknowledge--or perhaps even consider--how irreplaceable those years
were.</TE>
<TE>   He was a professional from the beginning, working diligently at
his craft. No one had seen anything like him, a bulletproof
super-child, wholly unto himself. Former assistant Larry Drew told
friends about angry team meetings, when Bryant's teammates would go
off on him, one after another, and, by way of reply, Kobe would go
out on the floor and jack up 25 shots.</TE>
<TE>   It took years to get him to accept them and vice versa. It wasn't
until last spring, near the end of a nightmare title defense, that
they finally got over the hump.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally or not, Bryant got married last spring after months
of tug-of-war with his parents, who moved back to Philadelphia,
underlining his new reality: He was now finally on his own.</TE>
<TE>   So this season, when he started getting technicals, put the freeze
on the media for a week and hit teammate Samaki Walker and opponent
Reggie Miller, it isn't hard to understand.</TE>
<TE>   He's working out late-teen things, in which one finds out, for
himself, where he ends and the rest of the world begins.</TE>
<TE>   It's all the more difficult for someone so famous, although he
always handled public scrutiny with ease.</TE>
<TE>   What looked like maturity, however, was merely poise. He was
always calm and his confidence never wavered, but there was always a
kid in there, driving.</TE>
<TE>   Having grown up pals with his father, he gravitated toward
mentors, like Jerry West and veteran teammates Byron Scott and Derek
Harper. The mentors doted on Bryant; one once told Kobe's agent, Arn
Tellem, he almost thought of Kobe as his son.</TE>
<TE>   "We all do," sighed Tellem.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant has only recently begun acknowledging how hard it was to
make the jump. Asked about LeBron James, the Ohio high school junior,
Kobe, who keenly resented the criticism he got for going pro out of
high school, noted:</TE>
<TE>   "If a person says they want to come out after their junior year, I
find myself being like most of the media guys covering me when I came
out of high school....</TE>
<TE>   "It's being tired, wanting to sleep in. Running around, hanging
out with your buddies, playing video games--you can't do that. You
have to watch film. You have to go to practice every day.... But I
wanted to play against the best. So I was, like, I'm just going to do
this and whatever comes my way, I'll just deal with it, but this is
my focus....</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when I first came into the NBA, I used to ride around
the UCLA campus, just looking. Checking out some of the students,
imagining what it would have been like if I'd have gone to school."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's forgiving virtue is, he figures out the right thing ...
eventually. He can't go around swinging at people for practical, not
to mention legal reasons, but after what he's been through, this
incident barely moves the needle.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago at this time, Shaq still wanted Kobe traded and the
possibility had occurred to Jackson too. Kobe was calling Michael
Jordan for advice, which sounded like he wanted to play for Mike in
Washington. Jackson knew about the calls because Jordan had told him.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't dare dream of an ending as happy as the one they got.
They wouldn't start their season-ending, 23-wins-in-24-games streak
until April 3.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all trusted Kobe's instincts," says Jackson. "He's been
pretty much a natural out here in this world of high visibility and
public demeanor. He's a great personality, he's got a winning way
about him and a winning smile.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, he went through a hard trial of injury, coach abuse a
little bit, a parental situation where he and I locked our horns a
few times.... And this season, we've had nothing but a lot of grins
and a lot of good times around here."</TE>
<TE>   Once more, Bryant figured out the right thing, standing up
manfully and apologizing to all concerned, with the notable exception
of Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Let the grins and good times roll. Who knows, maybe one of these
days, they'll even start playing well.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Kobe just learned more about what he can and
can't do. In this remarkable, still-just-23-year-old life, basketball
is way the easy part.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   In news as surprising as it was incomprehensible, the New York
Knicks rehired Coach Don Chaney, who is 13-28 with the team that went
10-9 under Jeff Van Gundy. This happened a day after an angry
postgame meeting, when Madison Square Garden head (and son of the
corporate CEO) James Dolan met with Chaney for 35 minutes after a
99-83 loss to San Antonio, during which fans filled the Garden with
boos. Thinking he was about to be fired the next day, Chaney talked
about how "draining" it had been, musing, "I was given an
opportunity, that's all I'm thankful for."</TE>
<TE>   Then Dolan announced Chaney would be back for one season, hinting
they would now tear down and rebuild, but avoiding specifics. "We
certainly recognize that the fans are interested in what we're doing
to improve the team," Dolan said. "We're certainly not happy with the
record and we're putting our energy into rebuilding the team. But
another NBA owner, a guy named Ted Turner, said something that I
really liked. He said, 'Churchill didn't fax Hitler the invasion
plans.' These guys [Knick officials] are going to give as much
[information] as they can to encourage the fans, but the NBA is very
competitive and they can't tell you every move and still be effective
running the team. So I think there has to be some grace period on
this." As if there's one thing the newspaper guys won't think of
before they do.</TE>
<TE>   Still engaging in mass delusion, New York papers covered General
Manager Scott Layden's scouting trip to China as if they thought he
might get off the plane home with 7-foot-5 Yao Ming. The New York
Daily News asked readers, "Would you rather the Knicks go on a run
and make the playoffs or get a high pick in the draft?" Here's a
scoop: The Knicks won't make a run at the playoffs, nor are they
likely to get a top pick. Even if they're tanking, or at least losing
at an impressive pace, they're still only eighth worst in the NBA and
I wouldn't look for the Warriors, Grizzlies, Bulls and Nuggets to win
too many the rest of the way, either.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Kernan in the New York Post: "Each day it's becoming clearer
that having Scott Layden and Jim Dolan in charge of the Knicks is
like putting Kenneth Lay in charge of Social Security." How do you
like your grace period so far, guys?</TE>
<TE>   Is anyone really ready to challenge the Lakers, aside from the
Lakers? "I'm not sure you can say we're better [than the Mavericks]
because we've been together longer," said Sacramento's Chris Webber
before a recent game in Dallas. "They're deep and we're deep but
until one of us wins the championship, we're both just versatile."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto's Vince Carter, who's either still slowed by his thigh
injury or semi-retired: "I'm not going to make excuses. If I'm going
to go out on the court, I have to leave that behind.... We want to
win so badly, we want to do so well that maybe I'm trying to do too
much." Either that or too little.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he's not into hoops: When the Bulls visited the White House,
Secretary of State Colin Powell asked 40-year-old, 5-10, 250-pound
equipment manager John Ligmanowski what position he played. "Point
guard," replied Ligmanowski.</TE>

<HD>New Look for Bracket Pairings</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember UCLA's first-round game against Hofstra in the NCAA
tournament last year? Then you probably remember the thousands of
empty seats in the Greensboro Coliseum, capacity 18,945.</LD>
<LD>   NCAA men's basketball chairman Lee Fowler noticed. So did the
other nine members of the Division I committee that oversee the NCAA
tournament. And that is why they voted to make changes to the bracket
pairings that appear drastic but in reality may have minimal impact.</LD>
<LD>   The drastic part? No longer will each of the two four-team groups
in a sub-regional be assigned to that region. For example,
first-round West Regional games at Albuquerque could consist of
four-team groups from the Midwest and South regions.</LD>
<TE>   It is designed to reduce travel costs, make the sub-regionals more
geographically desirable to fans and avoid situations like the West
sub-regional in Boise, Idaho, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Among the teams assigned to that site were Maryland, Georgetown,
George Mason, Georgia State and Hampton, making it next to impossible
for fans of those schools to follow their teams into the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The Eastern schools were not alone. California played Fresno State
in a first-round South game at Memphis, Tenn. Only 8,602 spectators
bought tickets for the game in the 19,000-seat Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   The number that stands out the most is that first- and
second-round games played to 80.2% capacity last year, down 13.7%
from 2000 and the lowest since the NCAA began compiling its list in
1989. And that number represents tickets sold.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new system, the committee will use the same 1-16 seeding
system but try to pair teams together geographically.</TE>
<TE>   Using Maryland as an example, the Terrapins would have played
George Mason in a first-round West Region game at Uniondale, N.Y.
Georgetown would have played Arkansas at Kansas City, Mo., an easier
destination for Hoya and Razorback fans.</TE>
<TE>   After the first two rounds, nothing changes. The regional
semifinals and finals will remain as planned: Syracuse, N.Y., in the
East; Lexington, Ky., in the South; Madison, Wis., in the Midwest,
and San Jose in the West.</TE>
<TE>   While Fowler and the committee are selecting the field of 65
teams, which will be announced today, the sub-regional assignments
will be almost as important. What could the brackets look like this
year?</TE>
<TE>   According to Jerry Palm's Web site collegerpi.com that features a
mock tournament bracket, Gonzaga, ranked sixth by the Associated
Press, and Oregon, the Pacific 10 regular-season champion, could both
be seeded fourth and play in Sacramento. Gonzaga would be in the West
region, Oregon the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky could get a No. 2 seeding in the East but would play its
opening-round game in St. Louis instead of Pittsburgh. The opposite
would be true of Cincinnati, which could be a No. 2 in the Midwest
and play in nearby Pittsburgh instead of St. Louis or Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   In Palm's example, Pittsburgh would benefit most of all. The
Panthers could be eligible to play in their home city because they
play their home games on campus and the regional is at Mellon Arena,
designated a "neutral" site.</TE>
<TE>   The changes appear to help teams seeded No. 2 through No. 4.
Top-seeded teams, like Duke or Kansas, would be sent to nearby
regionals as they always have. If a team is seeded No. 8 or No. 9,
the changes won't have any impact.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA or Stanford, which could end up in that category, can expect
a long flight. The committee can fine-tune the pairings only so much.
If a team is  seeded No. 16, it will  happily go wherever the NCAA
tells it  to go.</TE>
<TE>   The facts are 31 conference tournament winners and regular-season
champions without a tournament get automatic bids. The remaining 34
teams are selected on an at-large bids.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Coach Jon Gruden is making good on his promise to make the
competition for Tampa Bay's starting quarterback job interesting next
season.</LD>
<LD>   The Buccaneers agreed to contract terms Saturday with free agent
Rob Johnson, who was released by the Buffalo Bills in a salary-cap
move last month.</LD>
<LD>   The length of the deal and financial terms were not disclosed.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson has passed for 5,166 yards with 29 touchdowns and 20
interceptions in seven seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was embroiled in a quarterback controversy with Doug
Flutie during much of his stay in Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay signed Brad Johnson to a $28-million, five-year contract
before last season. The Buccaneers also have Shaun King, who Gruden
has said is a good young player who could make the competition
"interesting."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It really doesn't matter where Dominik Hasek and the Detroit Red
Wings play. They win wherever they are.</LD>
<LD>   Hasek stopped 28 shots Saturday in stretching his unbeaten streak
to 15 games in the Red Wings' latest victory--5-2 over the Blues at
St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit has won a team-record eight in a row on the road. The Red
Wings also have won their last eight overall, one shy of the team's
record winning streak.</LD>
<TE>   Luc Robitaille scored twice for the Red Wings, who lead the league
with 100 points and a 46-11-6-2 record. Robitaille, who has 29 goals
in his first season with Detroit, has scored six times in six games.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, we were up against the best," St. Louis Coach Joel
Quenneville said. "They got some much skill and talent with the puck.
They turn marginal chances into great chances. They have patience in
the scoring area. You know, that power play is deadly."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit was two for nine with the man-advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Hasek, traded from Buffalo to Detroit in the off-season, is 13-0-2
since his last loss Jan. 16 at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been on a good roll for the last six weeks," Detroit Coach
Scotty Bowman said. "Really, he's been good all [season]. He seems to
make the big saves when we need it."</TE>
<TE>   The Blues, winless in six games (0-4-2), are 4-3-4 in their 10
games at home against Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "When it rains it really pours, and it seems like it's pouring
right now," St. Louis goalie Brent Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, New York Rangers 2--Jan Hrdina scored 37 seconds
into overtime, lifting the Penguins at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers have dropped six of eight and lost a point to the
Penguins in the race for the Eastern Conference playoffs. Pittsburgh,
in 11th place, trails New York by four points.</TE>
<TE>   New York's Sandy McCarthy forced overtime by scoring with 1:51
left in the third period. Andreas Johansson had the other New York
goal.</TE>
<TE>   Ranger center Eric Lindros is out day to day with a bruised foot.
He was injured while blocking a shot late in the second period.</TE>

<TE>   Boston 3, Calgary 2--Sergei Samsonov scored with 2:31 left in the
third period at Boston and the Bruins won despite Jarome Iginla's
league-leading 42nd goal.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Zamuner and Marty McInnis also scored for Boston, which posted
its second victory in a row after not having won in its previous five
games.</TE>
<TE>   Iginla, who leads the league in scoring with 77 points, has seven
goals and six assists in his last seven games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 3, Ottawa 2--Phoenix captain Teppo Numminen scored two
goals, coming within one of his career 100th, and host Phoenix
vaulted into a tie for fifth place in the Western Conference playoff

<HD>The Curse of ESPN Movie</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given the thankless task of trying to portray Bob Knight in ESPN's "A
Season on the Brink," Brian Dennehy throws a chair, curses, pummels a
water cooler, curses, upends a cart of basketballs, curses, berates
everyone around him, curses, says he can't take it anymore, curses
and storms off camera.</LD>
<LD>   If only real life had imitated art.</LD>
<LD>   Dennehy, an award-winning actor, didn't need this. He didn't have
to risk his honorable reputation on ESPN's first--and, we can
mightily hope, last--attempt at movie making. As soon as he saw the
hack job of a script, he should have flung it across the room,
dropped a few f-bombs (in keeping with his character for one final
moment) and high-tailed it back to Showtime, where he won Emmy and
Screen Actors Guild awards for his portrayal of Willie Loman in
"Death of a Salesman."</LD>
<TE>   For his next role, I'd advise Dennehy to strongly consider the
lead in "Firing of an Agent."</TE>
<TE>   Billy Packer has called "A Season on the Brink," which airs
tonight at 5, "a piece of garbage." Packer is right, but for the
wrong reason--he was deeply offended by the profanity in the script,
which shows Knight to be a man in dire need of a bigger rhyming
dictionary. In one early sequence that somehow wasn't featured in
ESPN's round-the-clock trailer, Dennehy as Knight uses the word that
sounds like "duck" 15 times in three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   (That could be a record, breaking standards set by "The Sopranos,"
"South Park" and Tom Lasorda.)</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the profanity is one of the very few things "A Season on
the Brink" gets right.</TE>
<TE>   This much, most of America knows about Knight: He throws tantrums,
he bullies referees and players, he wins a lot of games, he got fired
from Indiana and he curses.</TE>
<TE>   To make a movie about Knight without expletives would be like
making a movie about World War II without bullets.</TE>
<TE>   Which, interestingly enough, is also something ESPN has tried.</TE>
<TE>   Two versions of "A Season on the Brink" will air tonight,
simultaneously, on ESPN and ESPN2.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN gets the rough cut, so to speak.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN2 gets the sanitized, supposedly-safe-for-young ears version.</TE>
<TE>   The network shipped copies of the R-rated cut for advance review
purposes, so I can only guess here: The other one's a silent movie,
right?</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the film, which focuses on Indiana's 1985-86
season, the host of Knight's television talk show asks the coach why
he uses the f-word so much.</TE>
<TE>   Because, Knight responds, it is "the most expressive word in the
English language. It can be used for surprise. (He helpfully provides
an example.) It can be used for anger. (Another example.) It can be
used for dismay. (One more example.)"</TE>
<TE>   Knocked back into his chair, the host runs up the white flag. "Got
it," he says. "I won't ask you when we go on camera."</TE>
<TE>   Looking away, Knight deadpans, "Well, that's your call."</TE>
<TE>   That's as funny, and as illuminating, as the movie gets.</TE>
<TE>   If you ever wondered how the "SportsCenter" cut-and-paste approach
might work for a feature-length film, here it is.</TE>
<TE>   The movie is one long procession of game highlights stitched
together with locker-room scenes and quick sound-bites and music, for
no apparent deeper purpose than filling up the appointed time slot.</TE>
<TE>   Except "SportsCenter" mixes it up--a little baseball here, some
basketball there, a football update after commercial break. Not here.
Here is what "A Season on the Brink" gives the viewer: rant, rant,
rant; touching scene with Knight and his son to show his softer side,
abuse, abuse abuse; touching scene with Knight and a former player to
show his softer side, rant, rant, rant; Indiana loses its Big Ten
finale to Michigan, Knight walks off the court.</TE>
<TE>   And then, as the closing credits roll, the movie completely
undermines itself by showing clips of the real Knight and all the
greatest hits--brandishing the bull whip, bullying Jeremy Schapp,
snarling through those infamous news conferences. Dennehy does his
best to capture the essence of Knight the ogre, but when you catch a
view of the real thing, Dennehy looks like nothing so much as a
cranky old uncle who just needs more hugs and a better sweater next
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, ESPN's first movie winds up torpedoed by the fact
it was ESPN's first movie.</TE>
<TE>   John Feinstein, who wrote the book on which the film is based,
once worked for the network as a basketball analyst before a very
acrimonious parting. ESPN needed Feinstein's assistance on the
project, but knew making the peace was going to be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   When it didn't happen and Feinstein decided not to participate as
a consultant, the producers were left to go it on their own.</TE>
<TE>   What they came up with, in Feinstein's view, is something "they
should air on Saturday morning, with all the other cartoons."</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein charges the movie makers with fabricating scenes
designed to "humanize" Knight, including the coach's final words to
his team after the regular season-ending loss to Michigan:</TE>
<TE>   "If you were to say to me, 'Pick one of two possibilities at the
end of that Michigan game: a) Knight walked up the ramp into the
locker room and said, "Fellas, let's not let one bad game ruin a
great season," or b) [he] was kidnapped by aliens walking off the
floor,' I would say b) was more likely."</TE>
<TE>   Too much of the budget was spent on promotion, Feinstein believes,
and says, "It shows. It shows in the quality of the movie and in the
fact that they have drummed up all this interest in it. Because
that's what ESPN does. They promote.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, is 'SportsCenter' any good? Not really. It's a bunch of
Keith Olbermann wannabes. But the commercials are brilliant. They do
a great job of promoting their brand. That's always been their
strength. But product is not their strength. And this is another
example."</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein, though, has kind words for Dennehy, who certainly
deserved better.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Dennehy was good," he says. "Given the material he had
to work with, he did about as well as you could do ....</TE>
<TE>   "But, as much as Dennehy tried, he can't be Bob Knight. Thank God.
There's only one."</TE>

<HD>Trojans Make Wrong Call by Blaming the Referees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't the fatigue. It wasn't the pressure.</LD>
<LD>   At the risk of being ridiculed by those ridiculous looking
red-shirted fans from Tucson--Bill Walton, you know who you are--it
wasn't even Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   What defeated USC in the Pacific 10 tournament championship game
Saturday was more cumbersome, consuming and avoidable.</LD>
<TE>   Appearing in the second half, it clung to the Trojans the way
Jason Gardner couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   It weighed them down the way Luke Walton wouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   It intimidated them the way no opponent can.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans lost to Arizona, 81-71, not because of a basketball,
but because of a chip.</TE>
<TE>   The giant chip on their shoulder about referees.</TE>
<TE>   For several years now, it has taken the shape of a belief that,
until they become a consistent national power, the Trojans are never
going to be fairly officiated in games against teams that are.</TE>
<TE>   This perception may be true. But it is also deadly.</TE>
<TE>   While griping at the officials Saturday, the Trojans lost a step,
diverted a focus, blew a game.</TE>
<TE>   Leading by eight points at halftime, a superior USC team was
haunted by an old inferiority complex that made weary legs even
heavier and tired minds wander. By the time the Trojans looked up,
Arizona had fashioned a 19-4 run and stolen the game.</TE>
<TE>   It happened on the court, where such leaders as Brandon Granville
and Sam Clancy would show frustration about calls while Arizona would
be flying past them toward another basket.</TE>
<TE>   It happened on the sidelines, where Coach Henry Bibby strayed too
far on the court and was assessed a costly technical foul with 1:50
remaining and the Trojans trailing by eight.</TE>
<TE>   Later, it happened in the interview and locker room, where the
Trojans illustrated the basketball equivalent of scolding the
weather.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby, in using a referee rip nearly as creative as his defense,
said his tired Trojans didn't run into a wall.</TE>
<TE>   "We ran into three walls," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, who scored only 12 points and was outrebounded by all
three Arizona big men, talked about something else entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just wondering what I had to do to get a call," he said. "I
mean, call a foul."</TE>
<TE>   Granville, who was called for four fouls by the same official,
Charlie Range, wondered something else.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt personal out there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a hint.</TE>
<TE>   It was personal.</TE>
<TE>   USC will not get the same calls as Arizona in a big game. It will
happen until USC wins as many games every season as Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Granville will be nailed for tiny fouls more than other guards. It
will happen as long as he continues to throw up his hands at bad
calls, angering referees who feel they have been embarrassed on
national television.</TE>
<TE>   As for Bibby, no, he is not allowed the same arguing latitude as
those coaches from Duke and Kentucky. But it will take at least
another Elite Eight appearance to change things.</TE>
<TE>   Is any of this fair? No.</TE>
<TE>   But can any of this be proven? Not hardly.</TE>
<TE>   Can the Trojans do anything to stop it? Not until robots are hired
as referees.</TE>
<TE>   So they should just stop trying.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe listen to a guy who, believe it or not, was Saturday's
voice of reason.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, that Jerry Dupree.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain times, we got frustrated with the officials' calls, and
we were so worried about the call, we didn't get back fast enough on
defense," said Dupree.</TE>
<TE>   Could it be that some of those incidences occurred during
Arizona's 50-32 second-half margin?</TE>
<TE>   "I think six times, they got around our press for a basket, right
behind our backs," Dupree said. "Other times, the referees would give
them the ball so fast after a call, they ran past us."</TE>
<TE>   A solution? Simple.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to just ignore the refs," said Dupree. "We need to let
the coaches handle that."</TE>
<TE>   So Bibby, even after two of the best consecutive wins in school
history, must go back to work as the team prepares for next week's
NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Because of this loss, the Trojans will probably be seeded no
better than fifth. Because of their underwhelming nonconference
schedule, it may be worse.</TE>
<TE>   This means by the time the tourney is dwindled to a Sweet 16--and
there's still little doubt that the Trojans are good enough for that
round--Bibby's team could face another longtime power.</TE>
<TE>   And this same issue could come up again.</TE>
<TE>   "We're SC, we see a lot of badly officiated games," said Clancy.
"I mean, we played Duke last year, we know the score. We had to play
a perfect game to beat them."</TE>
<TE>   So maybe that will be the case this year.</TE>
<TE>   So what?</TE>
<TE>   If the Trojans would stop worrying so much, they would realize,
they are capable of such a game</TE>
<TE>   Instead of looking at the striped shirts, they would be wise to
look underneath the cardinal-and-gold shirts, a source of power that
has worked before.</TE>
<TE>   It worked against Stanford. It worked against Oregon. For the
first half Saturday, it worked against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans must now believe it can also work against a long plane
ride, a strange arena, a chippy opponent ... and, yes, even the
officiating.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, we have said that to each other before," acknowledged
Granville. "We have said, 'Let's keep the game out of everybody
else's hands. Keep it out of the officials' hands. Keep it out of the
opponents' hands.'</TE>
<TE>   "Remind ourselves to play hard enough to win the game by enough
that we won't have to worry about anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Now you're talking.</TE>

<HD>Fairfax Falls Against Poly With Burns on the Bench</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Clad in street clothes, Los Angeles Fairfax High forward Evan Burns
clapped his left hand against his right forearm and exhorted his
teammates as if he were their coach, doing practically everything a
sidelined player could do to coax his team to victory.</LD>
<LD>   Burns' cheering routine reached a crescendo early in the fourth
quarter Saturday as Fairfax trimmed Long Beach Poly's 17-point lead
to five on two occasions and looked like it was capable of winning a
second consecutive game without its leading scorer. Burns, whose
right hand was swathed in bandages, accidentally cut a finger on
glass earlier in the week.</LD>
<LD>   But that's when Jackrabbit forward Marcedes Lewis stepped up to
score five of Poly's next 10 points as the Jackrabbits pulled away
for a 76-66 victory in a Southern California Regional Division I
semifinal at L.A. Southwest College.</LD>
<TE>   The fourth-seeded Jackrabbits (30-3) will play top-seeded
Westchester, a 91-74 winner over Fresno Clovis West, in the regional
final at 8 p.m. Saturday at Long Beach Arena. It will be Poly's first
appearance in a final since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Butler led all Poly scorers with 22 points, Carlos Rivers
added 14 and Bobby Jones had 12.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Bausley scored 19 points for second-seeded Fairfax (30-5),
which rallied after falling behind, 48-31, early in the third
quarter. Lion guard Jahsha Bluntt's third three-pointer of the
quarter pulled Fairfax to within 54-46.</TE>
<TE>   After Jamal Boykin scored inside to cut the deficit to 58-53 early
in the fourth, Bluntt (16 points) and Kevin Bell (13) missed
three-pointers that could have made it a two-point game.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys played hard and showed a lot of character," Fairfax
Coach Harvey Kitani said. "I'm proud of their effort."</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Westchester 91, Clovis West 74--Brandon Heath started it, Trevor
Ariza helped finish it and the Comets won a regional semifinal at
Southwest College.</TE>
<TE>   Heath scored 20 of his 28 points in the first half to stake
Westchester to a 48-33 halftime lead, and Ariza scored on an
acrobatic dunk in the third quarter to all but finish off Clovis West
(28-4).</TE>
<TE>   With 4:25 left in the third quarter, Ariza stole a cross-court
pass, dribbled down court and dunked over two Clovis West players to
give the Comets (30-2) a 61-39 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see anybody," said Ariza, who finished with 16 points.
"I just saw the rim and me going up."</TE>
<TE>   Heath made four three-pointers in the first half. "I was feeling
it," he said. "I've been working hard all week to get in a rhythm. It
was time for me to step up and play."</TE>
<TE>   Tyrese McDaniel had 33 points for Clovis West, which scored 10 of
the final 12 points of the game.</TE>

<LD>Of course, UCLA will get its bid to the NCAA men's basketball
tournament today. The Bruins will probably be seeded between No. 7
and No. 10. They will continue playing games even though all
indications are that they have no real interest in doing so. Just
saying things will be better doesn't make it so.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the numbers say UCLA deserves its bid. Its RPI, that
sacrosanct and mysterious computer ranking the NCAA selection
committee counts on so strongly, will be somewhere near 27. Bruin
supporters will note that eight of the team's 11 losses came to
opponents ranked in the top 50. Bruin supporters will shout out about
the strength of schedule--ranked in the top 10--and will brag,
rightly so, about victories against No. 1 Kansas and No. 8 Alabama.</LD>
<LD>   So UCLA will get its bid. And that's too bad.</LD>
<TE>   While watching the Bruins go 8-9 over their last 17 games,
watching how the players brought no emotion and little sense of
urgency to Staples Center in their first-round Pacific 10 tournament
loss to California, watching UCLA players staring into space as Coach
Steve Lavin chatted with them during timeouts, the idea occurs that
it would not be terrible if UCLA did not get an NCAA bid.</TE>
<TE>   Just as it wasn't wrong when the UCLA football team--once in line
for a Rose Bowl bid, was at the end of the season in line for the
title "Most Dysfunctional Team"--was left with no bowl game, it would
not be an injustice if the Bruin basketball team was snubbed by the
NCAA selection committee.</TE>
<TE>   There would be good lessons for all involved.</TE>
<TE>   First for the players. College sports is supposed to be about
learning. In their time at UCLA, what have Matt Barnes, Billy Knight,
Dan Gadzuric, Jason Kapono, et al, learned? That the regular season
isn't worth much as long as you play hard a few times, beat a Kansas,
win at Stanford, save a miracle to beat USC? Is everything else
forgotten?</TE>
<TE>   In watching Saturday's Pac-10 championship game, it was
interesting to see how such young Arizona players as Salim Stoudamire
and Channing Frye have improved their games, how the Wildcats became
a better team after having an early 30-point loss to Oregon and then
a 10-point home loss to the Ducks a couple of weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   It was interesting to see how USC Coach Henry Bibby made backups
Jerry Dupree and Desmon Farmer learn discipline and self-control and
defense so that now they make the Trojans one of the most dangerous
NCAA tournament teams around.</TE>
<TE>   Accepting a National Invitation Tournament bid would be a good
lesson for Lavin. If he is going to continue coaching the Bruins, he
needs to understand that coaching by the seat of his pants is not
good enough. It is not enough to jump five feet off the ground when
Cedric Bozeman scores a layup or Kapono makes a desperate three-point
basket as the shot clock runs down. It is not good enough to rely on
the emotion of kids and their natural talents to carry UCLA through a
round or two or three of the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   It is not enough to keep reminding us of past trips to the Sweet
16 or Elite Eight as proof that everything is OK in Westwood if we'll
only be patient and wait for the NCAA tournament. Maybe, if Lavin is
going to be the coach at UCLA, he'll decide that hiring an assistant
coach with some years of experience and accomplishments on his resume
would not be looked at as some weakness of Lavin's but as a smart
hire by a humbled coach who is gaining an understanding of what he
doesn't understand.</TE>
<TE>   Missing the NCAA tournament would be a favor to most Bruin fans
too. The ones who feel the criticism of Lavin is unfair would be
spared the angst of a first-round loss to a Texas or St. John's and
might also understand that a team needs to be a growing, improving
work of collective advancement instead of regression. A season is not
supposed to be about the excuses but of the explanations.</TE>
<TE>   And the Bruin fans who have given up on Lavin should also welcome
a rest. For what this team has accomplished in its handful of big
victories it has given away in its passive acceptance of mediocrity
this last half of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, a non-invitation might catch the UCLA
administration's attention. There is a massive unhappiness bubbling
among Bruin fans. It is evident on the radio, on the Internet, in the
letters to the editor, among the loyal fans who come to Pauley
Pavilion ever hopeful and leave sad and disgruntled.</TE>
<TE>   An NCAA tournament invitation should be earned, yes, but should
also be a reward for an accomplishment at whatever level it is you
practice your craft.</TE>
<TE>   It is an accomplishment for a Butler to have gone 25-5 even if the
last loss came in the quarterfinals of the Horizon Conference
tournament. It is an accomplishment for Southern Illinois to win a
school-record 26 games or a Ball State to have beaten a UCLA so
thoroughly. All those bubble teams would make the NCAA tournament a
more joyful place.</TE>
<TE>   It is not an accomplishment for UCLA to have finished sixth in the
Pac-10 or to have won 19 games or even to have beaten Kansas, a team
with no more tradition or advantages than UCLA. The Bruins' arrival
at the NCAA tournament will not make the event better. Or themselves.</TE>

<DH>Golf: Nelson shoots 64, Pooley a 65, but no one can get
close to Irwin, who takes three-stroke lead into final round of
Toshiba Senior Classic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unless Hale Irwin continues to pull away from the field, Larry Nelson
and Don Pooley figure to be among those in contention to win the
$1.5-million Toshiba Senior Classic today at Newport Beach Country
Club.</LD>
<LD>   Nelson shot a 64 in the second round and is tied for second with
Allen Doyle and Gil Morgan at eight-under 134. That group is three
strokes behind Irwin, who also shot a 64. Irwin's 36-hole total is
131.</LD>
<LD>   Pooley, after a 65, is at 135 along with Michael Zinni (66) and
Walter Hall (67).</LD>
<TE>   Irwin had six of his eight birdies after what he called a "miracle
par" on the 368-yard seventh hole. His tee shot hit a tree and after
a tough second shot he hit a sand wedge to within three feet.</TE>
<TE>   If Irwin can maintain his momentum, he'll win the $225,000 first
prize.</TE>
<TE>   If Pooley were to win, he would earn almost as much as the
$266,976 he won in the seven Senior PGA Tour tournaments he played
last year after turning 50 in August and joining the tour in
September.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Pooley ends up making, he may owe a portion to Nelson.
Pooley credits a lesson he got from Nelson on Thursday for getting
his game straightened out.</TE>
<TE>   "We're having dinner tonight," Nelson said. "I may let him pick up
the tab. That should take care of it."</TE>
<TE>   Pooley and Nelson have been friends for more than 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   "He helped me out when I first made the PGA Tour," Pooley said. "I
was kidding him the other day, before this tournament started, that
maybe he could help me out again."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson didn't take it as a joke.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, let's go out to the range," he told Pooley.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said he spent only about five minutes working with him.</TE>
<TE>   "He just needed some help with his set-up," Nelson said. "He was
lining up to the right. With 90% of the guys out here, it's either
ball position or alignment. If you're trying to change someone's
swing, you've got a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday was a good day for Pooley. After his 65, he went off to
find a TV and watch Arizona, his alma mater, finish off USC in the
Pacific 10 tournament title game.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Zinni, a qualifier from Mankato, Minn., Pooley is the
least-known player atop the leaderboard.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin is the senior tour's all-time money leader. Doyle, the
first-round leader who came in with a 70 Saturday, was the leading
point and money winner last year. Morgan was third in money and fifth
in points. Nelson was fourth in both. Hall won the AT&amp;T Canada Senior
Open last year.</TE>
<TE>   Pooley's best finish last year was a tie for fourth, and his best
in the four senior tournaments he has played this year was a tie for
12th in the ACE Group Classic at Naples, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Pooley, who is originally from Riverside and now lives in Tucson,
finished eight over par last weekend in the SBC Senior Classic at
Valencia Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   Since Nelson got him straightened out, Pooley has had rounds of 70
and 65.</TE>
<TE>   He started Saturday's second round with three consecutive birdies.
And he made a 50-foot bunker shot at 15 for an eagle. He bogeyed the
fourth hole when he three-putted, and he also bogeyed the 185-yard,
par-three 17th.</TE>
<TE>   "I hit my worst shot of the day off the tee," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was left with a tough shot from a bunker and then two-putted.</TE>
<TE>   On the 510-yard, par-five 18th, his second shot ended up in a
bunker 50 yards from the hole. His bunker shot was just short of
rolling onto the green and close to the pin; instead it rolled back
down. He chipped up and two-putted for par.</TE>
<TE>   Pooley said his wife Margaret and daughters Lynn and Kerri will be
among his supporters in the gallery today. Both daughters attend
Biola in La Mirada and Kerri, a sophomore, is a point guard on the
women's basketball team.</TE>

<LD>The folks at USC were not happy with me a few months ago, so an
anonymous source in the athletic department told a student writing
for the Daily Trojan he had some real dirt on me that might lead to
my dismissal and get me off the school's back.</LD>
<LD>   He told the student I had taken my 23-year-old daughter to a
USC-Notre Dame game two years ago, and had gotten her into the press
box at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   That was true, of course, and while I had permission from USC and
The Times to take my kid to work for a day and the Daily Trojan made
no mention of that, I'd have taken her without it because I hope to
introduce her one day to a gifted athlete who will make big money and
set me up for life. If there was any mistake I made, it was taking
her to USC in search of a gifted athlete.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TRUTH be told, of course, I should have been dismissed a long
time ago.</TE>
<TE>   I took my father to the PGA Tour's Western Open near Chicago in
1974, gave him a media pass, told him to act like he was a reporter,
and, I'll have to be honest now, there's no telling how much free
food he ate that day.</TE>
<TE>   Now it just so happens that June day in 1974 was one of the very
best days in my father's hard-working life, and coincidentally the
same day Tom Watson won his first PGA tournament. I guess that
explains why I was at the Toshiba Senior Classic in Newport Beach on
Saturday, compelled in some way to let Watson know how much enjoyment
he had given my father.</TE>
<TE>   I had no other reason to be here, so I knew I was risking a lot
perchance I ran into someone from USC and they leaked it to the Daily
Trojan. There's no telling the damage that could be done knowing I
was using a media pass only to get to Watson to tell him about Red
Simers, the older man who had been sitting in the front row at
Watson's news conference 28 years ago--asking him the stupid question
that had everyone laughing. Like father like son, of course.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FORTUNATELY, WATSON had no idea who I was, and apparently hadn't
talked to Fred Couples or Robert Allenby recently about their little
chats with me at the Nissan Open, so he agreed to meet before teeing
off.</TE>
<TE>   He remembered beating J.C. Snead and Tom Weiskopf by two strokes
for his first win, and I remembered the look on my dad's face as he
walked around Butler National, a ritzy club outside Chicago, and how
in awe he was of the grounds, the players and the chance to
experience such privilege</TE>
<TE>   I told Watson that Red had worked two jobs most of his life and
had a passion for golf, cocking his head just like Jack Nicklaus but
not swinging anything like him. I told him Red never had the chance
to rub shoulders with any celebrities, making that June day with
Watson something he talked about the rest of his life, and all the
while Watson listened as if he was interested. I've been married for
29 years, so I'm not used to someone listening to me, so I kept
talking.</TE>
<TE>   I mentioned the bond between father and son on the golf course,
caddying for my father as Watson had caddied for his own dad,
sneaking a few swings in once away from the clubhouse and then trying
to beat him. I asked Watson, who has won eight majors, if he had ever
beaten his father, and right away he says, "Had him two down with
three to go in the Walloon Lake Country Club championship when I was
13 years old. He tied me on 18, and beat me on the second playoff
hole."</TE>
<TE>   A year later Watson came back to defeat his father, but speaking
from experience, it's the admiration for the old man's wins that
lingers.</TE>
<TE>   Now I can't remember Dwyre's first name, as you know, but I can
tell you the time of day--5 p.m.--and the time of year--July--and the
day of the week--Saturday--when I thought I had beaten my father for
the first and only time in my life.</TE>
<TE>   We had just teed off on No. 18, and I was up by 10 strokes when he
started counting the clubs in my bag. He found 15--one over the legal
limit--and said he'd have to apply the appropriate penalty, two
strokes a hole for every hole while playing with too many clubs. As a
result, I lost to him by 26 strokes.</TE>
<TE>   I protested. "You're my father and you're the one who told me to
throw that new driver in the bag and give it a try to see if I would
like to keep it, and now you're calling me on it?"</TE>
<TE>   I'll never forget that grin on his face. And when I tee off now, I
do so after counting my clubs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW IF my dad had vowed to never die until Phil Mickelson had won
a major, he'd still be here, and on this perfect day in Orange County
we'd have been walking down the fairway giving me something more to
file in the memory bank.</TE>
<TE>   I might have had his two grandchildren here and the grocery store
bagger--every one of them, of course, with media passes. What a
glorious day that would have been. I'd have liked to have seen the
bagger in the company of my father.</TE>
<TE>   "My father passed away two years ago," Watson said, so we were
talking the same language now as we reminisced. "I remember taking my
dad to play Augusta. A special moment in life. I think my dad shot 77
or 79 that day."</TE>
<TE>   There's no way my dad could ever shoot 77 in his life--unless I
shot 78.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WE TALKED some more, I mentioned playing Bighorn Golf Club in Palm
Desert recently and wishing my dad had the chance just once in his
life to play such a piece of heaven, and then urged Watson to go out
and "win one for Red."</TE>
<TE>   He gave me a nice smile and went out and posted a 40 on the front
nine. Obviously I was concerned; I was afraid he misunderstood, and
heard me say, "Hit 'em like Red."</TE>

<HD>Howard Could Get His Chance</HD>
<DH>Soccer: With Keller unavailable, MetroStar goalie might
make debut for national team today against Ecuador.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States, coming off an impressive 4-0 soccer victory over
Honduras in Seattle last weekend, plays fellow World Cup finalist
Ecuador today in Birmingham, Ala.</LD>
<LD>   The 1 p.m. game--to be shown live on ABC and Telemundo and
broadcast by the Futbol de Primera radio network--could see New
York/New Jersey MetroStar goalkeeper Tim Howard make his national
team debut.</LD>
<LD>   That's because last Saturday's starter, Kasey Keller, has been
recalled by his English club team, Tottenham Hotspur, much to his
displeasure.</LD>
<TE>   "The club is cutting my time short so I can come back and sit on
the bench against Manchester United and Chelsea," an angry Keller
told England's Evening Standard newspaper after Tottenham Coach Glenn
Hoddle said the U.S. keeper, a backup at Spurs, could not stay for
the Honduras and Ecuador games.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves the door open for Howard, who turned 23 on Wednesday,
to stake his claim to the No. 3 goalkeeper spot at the World Cup this
summer behind Keller and Brad Friedel, who is in England trying to
help his club, Blackburn Rovers, out of relegation danger.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what my chances are," Howard told the New York Daily
News.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some things I have to improve on and that I have to be
able to prove.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at Brad and Kasey and they're world-class goalkeepers.
That's a high standard to look up to. That's something I won't be at
for several years."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also will be without defender Eddie Pope, defensive
midfielder Richie Williams and winger Bobby Convey, who returned to
their Major League Soccer club, D.C. United, which played a midweek
CONCACAF Champions Cup game in Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders Gregg Berhalter and Jeff Agoos and winger DaMarcus
Beasley are nursing injuries sustained against Honduras.</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador will be missing its captain, Ivan Hurtado, because of an
ankle injury, and striker Agustin Delgado, whose nine goals in
qualifying play helped Ecuador reach the World Cup for the first
time, did not make the trip because he is recovering from knee
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Striker Angel Fernandez also is injured, but forward Ivan
Kaviedes, who scored the goal against Uruguay that clinched Ecuador's
spot in Japan/Korea '02, will likely start.</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador, which defeated World Cup-bound Turkey, 1-0, last month,
is 4-0-4 against the U.S. in a series dating from 1984.</TE>
<TE>   The teams played to a 0-0 tie in June in Columbus, Ohio.</TE>

<HD>FIFA President Is Facing a Dark, Stormy Outlook</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only five weeks ago, Joseph "Sepp" Blatter was basking in the
afternoon sunshine at the Rose Bowl, seemingly at peace with the
world as he presented the CONCACAF Gold Cup trophy to the victorious
United States team.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, however, angry storm clouds have gathered around the
FIFA president and the impending deluge could sweep the 66-year-old
Swiss banker, ostensibly soccer's most powerful figure, right out of
office.</LD>
<LD>   There have, for example, been published allegations of bribery,
claims that Blatter supporters bought the votes that got him elected
president in 1998 as successor to his former boss, Brazil's Joao
Havelange.</LD>
<TE>   Then too, there are serious concerns that FIFA's finances are in
disarray and that Blatter has been covering up the potential economic
disaster facing world soccer's governing body.</TE>
<TE>   One senior FIFA official has said that the Salt Lake City
cash-for-votes scandal that engulfed the International Olympic
Committee "actually pales in its extent compared with FIFA's own
scandal."</TE>
<TE>   Blatter has consistently denied all bribery and corruption claims
and has said they are part of a smear campaign to oust him when he
comes up for reelection at the FIFA Congress in Seoul, South Korea,
on May 29, two days before the World Cup begins.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last two weeks, the embattled Blatter has suffered
significant political losses, and support for him appears to be
eroding almost daily.</TE>
<TE>   Things started going wrong last April, with the economic collapse
of International Sports Media and Marketing (ISMM) and its
subsidiary, ISL Worldwide. The pair were FIFA's World Cup partners,
one holding the marketing rights to the 2002 and 2006 World Cup
tournaments and the other the television rights to both events.</TE>
<TE>   When ISMM/ISL was declared bankrupt by a Swiss court in May, with
debts of $1.2 billion, it was said to have cost FIFA about</TE>
<TE>   $32 million, according to its own estimates. But Blatter's critics
contend the amount might be as much as $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, fears have been raised that the financial crisis
facing German media giant Kirch, which took over the World Cup
television rights from ISL, might imperil worldwide television
coverage of this summer's tournament.</TE>
<TE>   In Tokyo on Feb. 27, Blatter said that "irrevocable bank
guarantees" mean there "is no danger of the World Cup not being on
television." The very next day, Feb. 28, Britain's Daily Mail
newspaper dealt Blatter's cause a severe blow when it published a
report by Andrew Jennings, the journalist who had exposed IOC
corruption in awarding Salt Lake City the recent Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   Jennings' report claimed that tens of thousands of dollars were
paid to FIFA members to vote for Blatter in his 1998 election
campaign against Lennart Johansson, the Swedish president of European
soccer's governing body, UEFA.</TE>
<TE>   The Daily Mail said that 18 African votes promised to Johansson
went to Blatter instead "after Arab backers [of Blatter] knocked on
hotel doors in the dead of night" and money changed hands.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper quoted Farah Addo, a vice president of the
Confederation of African Football (CAF) and president of Somalia's
soccer federation, as saying all 51 African votes had been pledged to
Johansson, but that bribes had been offered to affect the election's
outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "The night before the election, people were lining up in Le
Meridien Hotel [in Paris] to receive money," Addo told Jennings.
"Some told me they got $5,000 before the vote and the same the next
day, after Blatter won.</TE>
<TE>   "I made my own inquiries and discovered 18 had gone over to
Blatter."</TE>
<TE>   Addo said he was offered $100,000 to switch his vote, but rejected
the attempted bribe.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter defeated Johansson, 111-80, a result that would have been
reversed had the 18 votes in question not switched sides.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Daily Mail article, FIFA's president angrily
denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not surprised that a report like this has surfaced at this
time," he told Agence France-Presse from FIFA's Zurich headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all part of a campaign of destabilization and defamation
which has been directed against me for some time."</TE>
<TE>   On March 1, the Daily Mail fired a second volley at Blatter,
quoting Mathieu Sprengers, president of the Dutch soccer federation
and treasurer of UEFA, as saying that Blatter was using funds
earmarked for the 2006 World Cup in Germany to help keep FIFA
financially afloat in 2002. Sprengers said Blatter had denied the
claim in public but had admitted it in private.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter tried to put the financial scandal behind him last week
when FIFA's Financial Committee-- headed by FIFA senior vice
president Julio Grondona of Argentina, a close Blatter ally--approved
an audit showing FIFA's finances are sound.</TE>
<TE>   "It is certain that we will amply cover all current and future
risks and any other unexpected expenses," Grondona said.</TE>
<TE>   That was challenged immediately, however, and in an extraordinary
general meeting Thursday of FIFA's 24-member Executive Committee,
Blatter lost his battle against an internal investigation into FIFA's</TE>
<TE>   finances.</TE>
<TE>   Ranged against him were the presidents of the European, African
and Asian soccer confederations: Johansson, Issa Hayatou of Cameroon
and Chung Mong-Joon of South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Chung, in a January letter to Jack Warner, CONCACAF's president,
said that the IOC's Salt Lake City scandal "actually pales in its
extent compared with FIFA's own scandal." He said an investigation
into FIFA's financial state is vital.</TE>
<TE>   "Without such a legitimate probe, no one ... would find it easy to
believe the simple explanations from the top," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to emphasize that the management of FIFA's finances
is flawed and the lack of transparency is at the root of current
speculations.</TE>
<TE>   "It is of critical importance that we provide a clear transparent
investigation of FIFA's financial situation so that we could restore
FIFA's honor and image to the world."</TE>
<TE>   That investigation will now get underway.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Blatter remains the only candidate in the May 29
election, but Cameroon's Hayatou, and possibly even Chung, might join
the fray in the coming weeks.</TE>

<HD>New Recruiting Allegations Stir Old Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nothing produces more paranoia among high school coaches than rumors
of private schools offering athletic scholarships.</LD>
<LD>   It's a concern as old as the oldest Catholic sports team, a
perception that fuels innuendo, suspicion and conspiracy theories.</LD>
<LD>   Private schools are allowed to offer financial aid based on need.
They're not allowed to offer financial assistance to lure or retain
talented athletes.</LD>
<TE>   It's rare that any coach or private school is caught promising
financial inducements to athletes, because proving the allegation is
difficult without compelling evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Section believes it found its version of a smoking
gun in a videotape that implicates Hal Pfeiffer, football coach and
athletic director at Riverside Notre Dame High. In a press release,
Jim Staunton, section commissioner, said, "The CIF Southern Section
is deeply troubled by recruiting efforts by a small group of
individuals associated with the Notre Dame football program."</TE>
<TE>   The audio portion of the videotape--there was no picture--reveals
Pfeiffer meeting with a group of parents of athletes from neighboring
schools and discussing how they can obtain discounts in tuition costs
for their sons. Southern Section officials, who conducted an
investigation, say sanctions against Notre Dame for recruiting
violations are possible. Pfeiffer, who completed his sixth season as
football coach, has been placed on paid administrative leave. He
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Father Howard Lincoln, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese
of San Bernardino that operates Notre Dame, said the tape "appears to
indicate" rules were violated. He said he accepts the tape as
authentic.</TE>
<TE>   "Offering financial incentives to lure high school athletes is
legally and morally wrong," he said. "The diocese feels when athletes
are lured by financial incentives, we're implicitly saying we value
fullbacks more than algebra students. We preach morality and people
have a right to hold the Catholic Church to a higher standard."</TE>
<TE>   The tape was made by Rob Gilbert, the father of former Notre Dame
running back Ryan Gilbert, during a meeting at a parent's home in
Moreno Valley last February.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert said Pfeiffer had made promises of financial assistance to
him that weren't fulfilled, so he secretly taped the meeting "for
evidence." He said he received permission to tape the meeting from
the parent who was host of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I did it because I wanted to be able to say, 'You're lying,'"
Gilbert said. Gilbert said he never played the tape for anyone until
January, after his son had been denied athletic eligibility following
his transfer to Moreno Valley Valley View. Copies of the tape were
sent to the Southern Section, the diocese and Valley View High.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, Pfeiffer tells the parents about a conversation he
allegedly had with a school administrator about how Pfeiffer wanted
to bring in 14 students. He said he suggested to the administrator
that if a 50% tuition discount were granted, athletes could be
brought in to make the football program successful.</TE>
<TE>   If the allegations against Pfeiffer are true, as the tape would
suggest, it validates concerns of many coaches that private schools
try to use tuition-aid packages to attract elite athletes, but the
question remains whether this incident is an aberration or widespread
practice.</TE>
<TE>   At a minimum, it's going to increase skepticism about the
integrity of the financial aid process.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an honesty system," said Principal William Thomason of L.A.
Loyola High. "We don't know what anybody else is doing. If it happens
to one private Catholic school, it fuels the flames, 'See, they're
all doing it.' I don't think that's true, but it's hard to dispel.
I'm sure it can occur anywhere, but I hope it doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln said Notre Dame will implement safeguards in response to
the violation, starting with making the athletic director job a
separate noncoaching position.</TE>
<TE>   Staunton said he believes what happened at Notre Dame was an
isolated incident. "I think that a number of forces lined up to allow
it to happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One major force is a liberal transfer policy throughout the
section that allows athletes to switch schools without moving.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, Pfeiffer says he is relaying information from an
earlier meeting he had with school supporters about raising funds for
a new campus.</TE>
<TE>   "Athletics is what's bringing kids to this school" is the message
Pfeiffer tells the parents he took from the earlier meeting. "The
more people we bring in, the more games we win, the more competitive
we become, the more money this school is going to have."</TE>
<TE>   Education, not athletics, is the main mission of high schools.</TE>
<TE>   This incident may have occurred at Notre Dame, but it's a blemish
shared by many.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to splash on all our doorsteps," said Tim Browne,
athletic director at Mission Hills Alemany.</TE>

<HD>Hoosiers' Day 'Recked' by One of Their Own</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If it wasn't fulfilling enough for a former Indiana Mr. Basketball to
play for his in-state Hoosiers, perhaps knocking them from their
perch supplied some enjoyment.</LD>
<LD>   Iowa's Luke Recker couldn't have asked for anything more: He beat
the clock and his former team on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Recker made a 15-foot runner from the right corner as time
expired--his second consecutive game-winner--to give Iowa a 62-60
victory over No. 23 Indiana in the Big Ten semifinals at
Indianapolis.</LD>
<TE>   Recker signed with Indiana out of high school but transferred
after his sophomore season.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never hit two like this in my career," said Recker, who won
Friday's quarterfinal against top-seeded Wisconsin with a 13-footer
with 1.4 seconds left. "When it went in, I saw my teammates attack
me. It was a great feeling."</TE>
<TE>   That made up for the way some fans treated him.</TE>
<TE>   Recker was booed throughout the game Saturday, but his reception
wasn't nearly as rude as the one he got in Bloomington last month
when he made his return to Assembly Hall. In that game, the fans
booed him in warmups and chanted at him all game.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this state. I'm very fond of Indiana," said Recker, who
played for Bob Knight for two seasons before leaving for Arizona,
which he eventually left for Iowa. "But there's that 5% of fans that,
unfortunately, act in a classless manner that probably made this more
enjoyable to win."</TE>
<TE>   After making the last shot, Recker hugged Indiana Coach Mike
Davis, an assistant when Recker played for the Hoosiers. Recker then
walked toward the Hawkeye crowd, pointing several times to the "IOWA"
on his jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "The hate mail I received, the e-mails--nothing life-threatening,
but just the letter saying how bad you stink--is pretty tough,"
Recker said. "That's where the emotion came in and the tears came
out. I can't describe to you what this feels like."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mirror image: In the spirit of flattery, Montana's Dan Trammel did
his best imitation of Recker in the Big Sky Conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Trammel, a 6-6 senior forward for the Grizzlies, saved his best
for last for the second game in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Trammel sank a go-ahead layup as the shot clock expired and
blocked a layup at the other end as Montana defeated Eastern
Washington, 70-66, Saturday to win the conference championship.</TE>
<TE>   "It was either he makes it or I block it," said Trammel, who did a
back flip when he was selected the tournament's MVP. "It was a little
scary, but I was putting everything on the line."</TE>
<TE>   In a semifinal Friday, Trammel slammed home a teammate's missed
three-pointer with 1.2 seconds left to give the Grizzlies a 70-68 win
over Montana State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speechless: Tic Price was in tears, hugging his wife.</TE>
<TE>   His McNeese State team was in the NCAA tournament for the first
time in 13 years. And for a coach who has faced rough times of late,
this was a rare good moment.</TE>
<TE>   McNeese defeated Louisiana Monroe, 65-43, in the Southland
Conference tournament title game.</TE>
<TE>   Price is in his first season at McNeese. He left Memphis in 1999
after admitting to having an affair with a student. His father died
in Virginia less than two weeks ago, only days after Price's home was
gutted by fire.</TE>
<TE>   Price didn't have any voice left after the game, so assistant John
Dillard answered questions.</TE>
<TE>   "The team showed a lot of heart and a will to win, and that was a
reflection of their head coach," Dillard said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Blue-collar crowd: So how did the three-day Staples Center college
basketball crowds for the Pacific 10 Conference tournament differ
from the nightly NBA crowds?</TE>
<TE>   Few celebrities, but more passion, albeit unlawful passion.</TE>
<TE>   The only celebrity anyone spot-ted during the three days was Kevin
Costner, who sat courtside for Friday's semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   As for the passion, it was evident in a nasty way Friday night
when spectators threw a couple of water bottles at referees as they
were leaving the court.</TE>
<TE>   When asked for help, Staples Center officials pulled out a canopy
tunnel that is used for hockey. On Saturday, the referees exited the
court underneath it.</TE>
<TE>   No, that tunnel has never been necessary for the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   But then again, this was clearly not the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fit to be untied: Pennsylvania and Yale were tied atop the
standings. In their Ivy League playoff game, there was never a doubt
which was the better team.</TE>
<TE>   Koko Archibong had 21 points and 16 rebounds as Penn advanced to
the NCAA tournament for the 20th time, dominating Yale, 77-58, at
Easton, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Archibong's effort changed the opinion of Yale Coach James Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to apologize," Jones said. "I didn't vote for him for
first-team all-league. He showed me tonight that he's a first team
all-league player. He played great."</TE>
<TE>   The playoff, the first in the Ivy League since Princeton beat Penn
in 1996, was played in front an evenly divided crowd of 3,651 at the
Kirby Sports Center.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hardly a high note: Howard's Gil Goodrich was suspended for the
first half of Saturday's Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference championship
for punching a Delaware State player in the groin during the
semifinals the day before.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no place for this type of behavior in the MEAC or in
college athletics in general," said Tim Autry, the athletic director
at South Carolina State and chair of the tournament committee.</TE>
<TE>   Goodrich punched Delaware State's Miles Davis--he got his name
from his grandmother who was a big fan of the legendary jazz
trumpeter--in a play away from the ball in the first half, leaving
Davis writhing on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the day: For the second consecutive season, Hawaii
traveled thousands of miles and secured an NCAA tournament bid by
defeating Tulsa on the Golden Hurricane's home court in Oklahoma.
Hawaii's 73-59 victory was its third over Tulsa this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the weak: Maine, seeking its first NCAA tournament
appearance, shot 36.4% from the field, went scoreless for more than
seven minutes in the first half and scored the lowest point total in
America East Conference championship game history in a 66-40 loss to
Boston University.</TE>

<HD>Up-and-Coming Players Deserving of an Ovation</HD>

<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>Everyone in women's tennis these days seems to have "ova" attached to
the end of their name.</LD>
<LD>   Well, not everyone--it only seems that way. Twelve players whose
names end in "ova"--an eighth of the draw--started the Pacific Life
Open and six are still in contention at the Indian Wells Tennis
Garden. They are from Slovakia, Russia, the Czech Republic,
Uzbekistan and Israel. Yes, Israel, by way of Russia, represented by
the appropriately named Anna Smashnova.</LD>
<LD>   But Smashnova has been a pro since 1991, and is ranked outside the
top 50, at No. 57. There are new "ovas" on the block and well worth
watching, especially on a day when the top players had little
trouble.</LD>
<TE>   Second-seeded Martina Hingis has been receiving acupuncture on her
right wrist, flying in a doctor from Switzerland. The wrist bothered
her last week at the women's tennis event in Scottsdale, Ariz., but
she said it improved. Previously, he also worked on her heel and
Hingis, 21, said: "I'm getting older."</TE>
<TE>   The wrist looked fine as Hingis defeated Silvija Talaja of
Croatia, 6-0, 6-1, in 41 minutes. Later, No. 4 Monica Seles beat
Martina Sucha of Slovakia, 6-0, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Those matches were on the Stadium Court, and the "ova" players
were dispatched to the outside courts.</TE>
<TE>   On Court 3, No. 13 Iroda Tulyaganova of Uzbekistan used her
powerful ground strokes and serve to easily dismiss qualifier Jelena
Kostanic of Croatia, winning the second-round match, 6-3, 6-3. Later
in the afternoon, No. 18 Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia survived the
stalling techniques of Tatiana Poutchek of Belarus on Court 2, losing
onlyfour games in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   Tulyaganova, 20, won two titles last year and had the
second-fastest serve on the tour in 2001, reaching 119 mph at Key
Biscayne, Fla. (Venus Williams had the fastest, 125 mph at
Wimbledon.)</TE>
<TE>   There are professional tennis events in Uzbekistan, but
Tulyaganova is setting an example for women in her country, reaching
her current ranking of No. 19. She hopes the youngsters at home
follow her strict work ethic, saying: "We want to win the Fed Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Tulyaganova has taken a deeper interest in children, donating
money and spending time with kids from the Mehrijon orphanage in
Tashkent. She gave $2,000 (U.S), which is a substantial sum in her
country.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I can win more money, I will give the more money," she
said, smiling. "I also promised them I will go play with them this
summer. I was there four times already, the fifth time I have to come
with my tennis racket."</TE>
<TE>   Leaving home was difficult after Sept. 11, especially after
Uzbekistan allied itself with the United States in the war against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared when I was out of Uzbekistan," she said. "I was
scared what was going on there in Tashkent. How is my family, my
sister, my grandmother, my family? I was calling almost every day, 10
times, five times a day.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they said, 'No, nothing is happening in Tashkent.' Only
things happening at the border. And Tashkent from the border of
Afghanistan is 1,500 kilometers. It wasn't close and they said U.S.
army is for us, they stay in front of us, so nobody one can bother us
in Uzbekistan."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Tulyaganova, Hantuchova is searching for her first WTA
singles title, though she reached the semifinals at Oklahoma City and
Birmingham last year. The 18-year-old has two Grand Slam mixed
doubles titles, winning Wimbledon in 2001 and the Australian Open in
January and made a big splash by taking Venus Williams to three sets
in Melbourne.</TE>
<TE>   Her father, Igor, is a computer scientist and mother, Marianna, is
a toxicologist. A nice change because some parents on the tour are
merely toxic.</TE>
<TE>   Hantuchova's first coach was her grandmother, Helena, who was once
the top player in Slovakia.</TE>
<TE>   "At that time, you couldn't travel," she said of her grandmother's
restricted career. "It was an old style of play, just the way they
used to play at the time. She comes to every practice to see me when
I'm at home. She was very, very strict, but we always had a lot of
fun."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Last year's men's final between Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi will
not be repeated. The draw came out Saturday and the fourth-seeded
Agassi and No. 10 Sampras could meet in the quarterfinals, if form
holds.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi, who has reached two finals in two events this year, is in
the same half of the draw as No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt of Australia.
Hewitt defeated Agassi in the San Jose final, 4-6, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4),
last Sunday. In the first round, Hewitt plays Carlos Moya of Spain,
Agassi faces Michel Kratochvil of Switzerland and Sampras meets a
qualifier.</TE>
<TE>   In the other half of the draw are No. 2 Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia, No. 3 Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain, No. 5 Tommy Haas of
Germany and No. 7 Marat Safin of Russia. Andy Roddick, seeded 11th,
will play a qualifier in the first round.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second week in a row, Andre Agassi advanced to the final of
an ATP event.</LD>
<LD>   Agassi, seeded No. 1, defeated seventh-seeded Xavier Malisse, 6-4,
6-4, in the semifinals of the Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic in
Scottsdale, Ariz., on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   He will face Juan Balcells, who completed his surprising march
through the bracket with a 6-3, 6-1 semifinal rout of Rainer
Schuetter in a match that took only 52 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Balcells, whose lone victory and only other final appearance on
the ATP Tour came two years ago in Bucharest, Romania, has never
played Agassi.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been watching matches of Andre since I was 15," the
26-year-old Spaniard said. "Now tomorrow I'm going to play against
him and that's going to be like a dream come true. I mean, he's like
an idol to me."</TE>
<TE>   After skipping the Australian Open because of an injured right
wrist, Agassi has come on strong. He thinks his mixture of experience
and skill could bring on a big season.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider myself to be in a real rare situation here where I
feel healthy, I feel strong, I'm moving well and I can bring my
experience to the court," he said. "It's a hard package to play
against."</TE>
<TE>   If he wins today, the 31-year-old Agassi will become the eighth
player to have 50 tournament championships in the open era, which
began in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Andy Roddick beat France's Anthony Dupuis, 7-6 (4) 6-4,
to advance to the final of the International Tennis Championships in
Delray Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick, who lives in nearby Boca Raton, is seeking his fifth ATP
Tour title since joining the circuit full-time last year. The
19-year-old star has won 14 of his last 15 matches.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick, who won the Memphis tournament two weeks ago and reached
the semifinals in San Jose last week, will meet fifth-seeded Davide
Sanguinetti of Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a pair of borrowed sneakers, Sanguinetti beat defending
champion Jan-Michael Gambill, 7-6 (8), 6-3.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Still At-Large</HD>
<DH>College basketball: USC goes missing in second half and is
denied conference's automatic NCAA bid as Arizona surges to 81-71
victory in title game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC's defense was swarming all over the Staples Center court Saturday
afternoon, forcing Arizona's ballhandlers into a rash of turnovers
while getting steals, blocking shots and taking charges.</LD>
<LD>   It was late in the first half and the Trojans seemed on the verge
of routing the Wildcats in the Pacific 10 Conference tournament title
game, having embarked on a 17-2 run in which five Trojans scored to
take a 13-point lead with 5:35 remaining until halftime.</LD>
<LD>   Then USC hit a wall.</LD>
<TE>   "We hit three walls," Trojan Coach Henry Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   And he wasn't referring to tournament most valuable player Luke
Walton, his father Bill, who sat in the front of the Arizona rooting
section sporting a bright red Arizona T-shirt, or to Wildcat Coach
Lute Olson.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby meant the three referees.</TE>
<TE>   Some would say that USC, playing its third game of full-court
pressure defense in as many days, merely ran out of gas. But others
in the USC camp alluded to the officiating and several calls aimed at
the Trojans to close out the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case, Arizona, behind freshman guard Salim
Stoudamire's career-high 29 points, was able to outrun the Trojans
the rest of the way and pulled away for an 81-71 win in front of
18,997 that clinched the Pac-10's automatic NCAA tournament bid.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Wildcats' fourth straight title in the Pac-10
tournament, which was revived this year after a 12-year absence.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for a coach who has spoken out often against a Pac-10
tournament. Olson says the added three days do nothing but create
missed school time while tiring out the league's NCAA qualifiers.</TE>
<TE>   The 22nd-ranked Trojans (22-9), who thrashed No. 16 Stanford,
103-78, on Thursday before beating regular-season champ and
ninth-ranked Oregon, 89-78, Friday night, await their at-large bid
and placement in the NCAA tournament bracket, which will be released
this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   USC, whose resume includes regular-season quality wins over
Stanford, UCLA and Arizona that it lacked last year, expects a better
seeding than in 2001, when the Trojans were seeded No. 6 in the East
Regional and shipped to Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   There had been speculation that a victory Saturday might have
earned the Trojans a seeding as high as No. 3 and kept them closer to
home. Instead, it is the Wildcats (22-9) who are angling for a No. 2
seeding in the West Regional.</TE>
<TE>   "I know where the game was lost," said Bibby, who was assessed a
technical foul with 1:50 to play. "[But] I plead the Fifth."</TE>
<TE>   After being called for one foul in the first 15:24 of the game,
the Trojans were hit with eight in the last 4:35 of the first half.
USC led, 33-22, before the whistles began blowing.</TE>
<TE>   But that's also when the Trojans stopped making shots.</TE>
<TE>   USC made only two field goals in the final five minutes of the
first half and could muster only two more in the first 8:46 of the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona, meanwhile, was breaking a tired USC press, getting easy
baskets and going on an 18-4 run.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Trojans got their third field goal of the second half,
the Wildcats had turned a 13-point first-half deficit into a
seven-point second-half advantage, 52-45, with more than 12 minutes
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   USC, buoyed by guard Desmon Farmer off the bench, answered with a
7-2 run in which Farmer knock down a three-point basket from the
right wing and tipped in a USC miss to get the Trojans within two,
54-52, with 8:49 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "The game's going to be full of runs," senior point guard Brandon
Granville said. "It's just a matter of who's going to make the
plays."</TE>
<TE>   The weary Trojans would not make many plays down the stretch as
Arizona pulled away.</TE>
<TE>   "We went out there in the second half not focused for whatever
reason," said Farmer, who had 15 points in 26 minutes. "And we
weren't executing on the defensive end. We were letting their guards
get open shots and they were knocking them down."</TE>
<TE>   Stoudamire, the league's freshman of the year, made nine of 10
shots from the field, five of six from three-point territory, to lead
the Wildcats. Walton had 23 points, 13 after halftime, and eight
assists, all in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Several Trojans complained about an officiating crew that called
six more fouls on USC (22) than on Arizona (16), and the Wildcats
attempted 13 more free throws, making 19 of 22 to USC's six of nine.</TE>

down."</TE>
<TE>   Trojan senior forward Sam Clancy, the Pac-10 player of the year,
played all 40 minutes and went to the free-throw line twice, missing
both attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy had a difficult game all the way around, scoring 12
points--more than seven below his average--on six-for-16 shooting and
taking five rebounds, barely half his average.</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Bibby Technical a Delayed Call</HD>

<LD>USC Coach Henry Bibby, never one to cozy up to referees, was called
for only one technical foul during the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   He had come close, though, to getting a second during the Trojans'
win at Stanford on Feb. 21. Charlie Range, whistle at the ready in
his mouth, positioned his hands about a foot apart and took a step
toward Bibby in anticipation before both backed off and play resumed.</LD>
<LD>   But Saturday, with 1:50 remaining in the Pacific 10 Conference
tournament title game between Bibby's Trojans and Arizona at Staples
Center, Range finished what was started in Palo Alto.</LD>
<TE>   With USC trailing, 75-67, Range issued a technical foul to Bibby,
who was upset at a foul call Range had made on Trojan point guard
Brandon Granville seconds earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the fact that Mr. Bibby kept berating me," Range said in
explaining his call. "It was unprofessional. The things he was saying
were unnecessary. There's a code of conduct in the rules, on berating
an official."</TE>
<TE>   Countered Bibby: "I don't go out and abuse and curse at the
officials. What happened before the technical, that's the issue
here."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby was referring to the 5-foot-9 Granville picking up his
fourth foul when he was called for an offensive foul against
6-foot-10 Arizona center Channing Frye.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what happened there," Granville said. "I was just
trying to set a screen. I'm not commenting on the refs. I might be
here all day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trojan forward Jerry Dupree, who staged a coming-out party during
the Pac-10 tournament, started for the second consecutive game
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But after blocking four shots in the first half, a career high,
the high-flying Dupree came back to earth and did not block any in
the second half, in which he played only nine minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We just weren't focused" after going up by 13 points in the first
half, Dupree said. "It was like we sat back and admired our work."</TE>

Coale said. "This is pretty special what we just did. But it's not

halftime. The Lady Bears (26-5), who got 23 points from Danielle
Crockrom, never recovered.</TE>
