<KH>ARCHITECTURE REVIEW</KH>
<HD>At college, a dorm that feels like real life</HD>
<DH>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</DH>

<LD>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- In America, experimental housing projects went
out of style in the late 1970s, along with other utopian adventures
like lunar landings and the welfare state.</LD>
<LD>   So the new Simmons Hall dormitory building at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, which opened here last month, is an
anachronism of sorts. Granted, it houses students at one of the
country's most elite universities. But its aim is to provide a model
for communal living that reflects the social tensions of a world that
is no longer utopian in spirit.</LD>
<LD>   Designed by New York architect Steven Holl, the $68-million
dormitory is on a former manufacturing site at the edge of MIT's
urban campus, flanked by sports fields to the south and railroad
tracks to the north. Its rigid, grid-like frame -- pierced by a
series of public and communal spaces -- evokes a world of Cartesian
order deformed by unconscious impulses. As such, it offers a
compelling alternative to the visions of communal harmony of an
earlier generation and the retro small-town developments that are the
norm today. In its willingness to address contemporary realities, it
is one of the most inspired housing designs built in America in
decades.</LD>
<TE>   Holl made his reputation in the 1980s with a number of small
housing proposals that were imbued with an awkward, almost clumsy
lyricism. Among the most compelling is the 1981 Bridge of Houses -- a
series of simple, boxy structures with pitched roofs and arcaded
passageways that was designed to rest on top of an abandoned segment
of elevated train tracks in Manhattan's West Village. Another design
from that time is a series of diminutive houses that plug into the
side of a warehouse workshop. Each house is capped by an odd-shaped
roof meant to evoke its inhabitant's skills as a craftsman -- a
barrel vault for a mason, a wood frame for a boat builder.</TE>
<TE>   Later proposals sometimes expanded that vision to a surreal scale.
A 1989 project in Arizona, dubbed the Spatial Retaining Bars,
proposed a series of slender towers, shaped like upside-down Ls, that
were intended to mark the outer edges of Phoenix's urban sprawl and
frame distant mountain views.</TE>
<TE>   Never built, these projects nonetheless evoked the dreamy
stillness of a De Chirico painting, a land of empty plazas and
haunting solitude.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Holl has landed a series of major commissions,
including the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki, Finland,
and the Cranbrook Institute of Science in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. --
both completed in 1998. His design for the Nelson-Atkins Museum of
Art in Kansas City, Mo., is scheduled for completion in 2004, and he
was recently selected to design a major addition and renovation for
the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. (That project is on
hold after failing to win a bond measure earlier this month.)</TE>
<TE>   But until now, Holl's only major housing commissions have been
outside of his native United States. The most celebrated is the 1991
Void Space/Hinged Space Housing in Fukuoka, Japan. Conceived as a
series of solids and voids linked by a long bar, the project's 28
apartments overlook a series of tranquil water courts. Each apartment
has its own identity, and they interlock like a three-dimensional
puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   In his design for Simmons Hall at MIT, Holl ratchets that vision
up another notch. At first glance, the building's hulking rectangular
form evokes the regimental order of a conventional modern housing
block. A cafe, dining hall and performance space are set at
ground-floor level; dormitory rooms are arranged in neat symmetrical
rows on the upper floors. The facade is conceived as a rigid concrete
grid, with endless rows of identical windows.</TE>
<TE>   But that sense of order soon falls apart. The window jambs are
painted a variety of colors -- red, orange, blue -- giving the facade
an unexpected visual complexity. Large voids are cut out of the top
of the structure, dividing it into three asymmetrical towers and
allowing views through the building to the surrounding cityscape.
Another void punches right through the building's form, where broad,
bleacher-like stairs lead up from the sidewalk to an outdoor
sculpture garden.</TE>
<TE>   The effect is mesmerizing -- as if the building were being broken
apart by violent social forces.</TE>
<TE>   The sense of communal energy dominates the first floor. A concrete
staircase, for example, curls up through the lobby, leading to the
dormitory floors. Just beyond the stairs, the performance space is
set below ground, its tough, cavernous concrete interior a seemingly
ideal venue for punk band performances or reunions of gray-bearded
'60s militants.</TE>
<TE>   The dining hall, by contrast, is more serene, sheathed in enormous
plate-glass windows that offer sweeping views of the street. A small,
meditative space, covered in blue glass, is intended as a temporary
escape from the academic pressures and social whirl of student life.</TE>
<TE>   Once you reach the dormitory floors, a sense of order temporarily
returns. The rooms line long, narrow corridors. Inside, the rooms are
compact, well-proportioned spaces. The only unusual detail here is
the grid of small mechanical windows -- each a mere 3-foot square --
which can be opened and closed using a series of cranks.</TE>
<TE>   But that sense of being inside a well-oiled machine is interrupted
by a series of communal lounges, whose bulging forms occasionally
protrude out into the corridors. Three stories tall, the lounges'
undulating, organic forms carve up through the various floors. Each
lounge contains an internal staircase so that they can be entered
from various levels. The idea is to create a communal node, to break
down the kind of segregation that is typical of dormitory floors.</TE>
<TE>   The lounges evoke a series of obvious metaphors. They are
sanctuaries for a budding counterculture, communal cells embedded in
a matrix of social isolation. But they are also conceived as havens
for creative exchange, set against the more rationally ordered world
of the mind.</TE>
<TE>   That freedom, of course, has its limits. Security, for example,
has become a major concern at college campuses, and the dining hall,
despite Holl's heated objections, had to be closed off to the street.
Access to the rooftop terraces is also carefully controlled. (MIT has
been plagued by a spate of much-publicized suicide attempts.)</TE>
<TE>   But just such contradictions prevent Holl's design from becoming a
monument to a worn-out idealism. The building's architectural
tensions imply an ongoing struggle between the individual and the
social, between freedom and conformity. Rather than resolve those
tensions, Holl seeks to make them explicit. It is that fact that
imbues the building with such a remarkable spirit of tolerance.</TE>

<LD>A sweeps-timed wedding on NBC's "Will &amp; Grace" generated the
program's second-largest audience ever, according to Nielsen Media
Research estimates, with the show attracting 24.3 million viewers
Thursday -- dropping time-slot competitor "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" to its smallest audience this season.</LD>
<LD>   The only "Will &amp; Grace" to draw a bigger audience was broadcast in
February and also featured a major guest star, Matt Damon. On
Thursday's installment, Grace (Debra Messing) married a character
played by Harry Connick Jr., culminating a romance that had been
building for weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "CSI" still won the 9 p.m. hour with almost 26 million viewers,
but the NBC comedy held a decisive edge in the younger demographics
most sought by advertisers. The CBS show that follows, "Without a
Trace," also slipped to its smallest audience yet, with 14 million
viewers.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>La Scala stagehands have no right to stay away from work on public
holidays, an Italian appeals court has ruled -- overturning a verdict
that had threatened performances such as the opera house's Christmas
concert.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling this week came a little more than two weeks before the
Arcimboldi theater -- opera's temporary home in Milan during La
Scala's 30-month renovation -- hosts the season's opening night.</LD>
<LD>   "Without this solution ... we would have all been poorer and
sadder," a lawyer representing La Scala, Pietro Ichino, told a Milan
newspaper.</LD>
<TE>   A tribunal in March ruled in favor of 115 workers after La Scala
had sought legal action over their refusal last year to work on
Italy's national day, which is observed on June 2.</TE>

dangling his baby from a hotel window before hundreds of startled

the incident, which was broadcast internationally.</LD>
<LD>   "The investigation has been called off by state prosecutors,"
police spokesman Matthias Pranger said. "They said there was no proof

<HD>In a world of poets, not readers</HD>

<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>According to the Tang dynasty poet Li Po, "a man should stir himself
with poetry, stand firm in ritual and complete himself with art and
music."</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen hundred years later, that's still pretty sound advice.</LD>
<LD>   But enduring Confucian virtues notwithstanding, if a guy really
wants to get some buzz going, he should stir up poetry with money.
That's what Ruth Lilly -- the selfless 87-year-old heiress to the Eli
Lilly pharmaceutical fortune--did last week, when she quietly gave
Poetry magazine a gift whose ultimate value may reach $150 million.
She also continues to fund the annual $100,000 Ruth Lilly Poetry
Prize.</LD>
<TE>   Her generosity to the 90-year-old Chicago publication generated
headlines and columns around the world not only because of the
donation's size, but also because the magazine and its editor of 25
years, Joseph Parisi, have rejected all the numerous poems Lilly has
submitted during the past few decades.</TE>
<TE>   Virtue rewarded makes a fine story, especially when it has a
rags-to-riches ending. Poetry qualifies on both counts. Continuously
published since 1912, the magazine has operated for the past 15 years
out of two rooms provided rent-free in the stacks of the Newberry
Library's annex. The four staff members have one window among them.</TE>
<TE>   The 300 to 500 poems they select for publication each year
continue a distinguished tradition. In its early years, Poetry
championed the work of pioneering modernists. T.S. Eliot's "Love Song
of J. Alfred Prufrock" first appeared in its pages, as did Ezra
Pound's great "imagist" poem "In a Station of the Metro." It
published early work by William Butler Yeats and Robert Frost, and
furthered Marianne Moore's career. Poetry was one of the first U.S.
publications to recognize Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney's work, which
it published in 1972. More recently, the magazine put together a
dual-language -- English and Gaelic -- edition of 37 contemporary
Irish poets with a critical overview by Dennis O'Driscoll.</TE>
<TE>   High standards rooted squarely in the international poetic
mainstream are Poetry's hallmark and probably make it a good choice
to become the Getty of little magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Buried deep in the avalanche of stories about the magazine's good
fortune, however, was a set of numbers that ought to arch the
eyebrows of anybody who cares about culture generally and poetry in
particular:</TE>
<TE>   According to Parisi, Poetry receives 90,000 submissions from 45
countries each year.</TE>
<TE>   Its total circulation per issue?</TE>
<TE>   Just 10,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, despite all the international publicity generated by
Lilly's bequest, the magazine reported that it had signed up only 165
new subscribers this past week.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Poetry's situation unique. According to the New York-based
Academy of American Poets, the vast majority of the roughly 1,700
U.S. publications that regularly print poetry have average
circulations of 1,000 copies or fewer.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a materially minded person might suggest that in market
terms, what we have is a serious imbalance between supply and demand.
In other words, a lot more people are writing poetry than are reading
it.</TE>
<TE>   Is that a bad thing or an inevitable thing? Does it suggest
something disturbing about readers or say something damning about the
kind of poetry generally being written? Welcome to a debate that has
been going on for more than half a century -- one that has provoked
legions of literate and passionate people into torrents of biting,
bracing, intemperate, articulate speech.</TE>
<TE>   As long ago as 1934, the great Edmund Wilson published a
controversial essay -- "Is Verse a Dying Technique" -- in which he
alleged that the ubiquity of lyric poetry had rendered the art so
ephemeral that the future belonged decisively to prose. In 1988,
Joseph Epstein published a similarly contentious essay -- "Who Killed
Poetry?" -- in which he argued that contemporary poetry was losing
readers because the modernists' broad cultural vision had been
replaced by the parochial preoccupations of "poetry professionals,"
most of whom were at universities.</TE>
<TE>   That critique was developed in far greater detail in a 1991 essay,
"Can Poetry Matter?" by poet and critic Dana Gioia -- now President
George W. Bush's nominee to head the National Endowment for the Arts
-- who pointed out that it "never has been so easy to earn a living
as a poet. There are now several thousand college-level jobs in
teaching creative writing, and many more at the primary and secondary
levels."</TE>
<TE>   Gioia went on to cite the vast system of public and private
subsidies now provided poetry publishing and reading, as well as the
existence of more than "200 graduate creative writing programs ...
and more than a thousand undergraduate ones. With an average of 10
poetry students in each graduate section, these programs alone will
produce about 20,000 accredited professional poets over the next
decade."</TE>
<TE>   And so they have -- and so Poetry magazine's 90,000 annual
submissions. Gioia, however, went on to decry what he sees as the
disconnect between those submitters of poetry and the potential
readers of poetry. The furor that followed was too large and intense
to recount here, but there is the inconvenient fact of the very
worthy Poetry's 10,000 subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   "Dana's point is that poetry publishing is supply-driven and not
demand-driven," said Malcolm Margolin, founder and publisher of
Berkeley-based Heyday Books, which has published a dozen volumes of
poetry during the past three years. "But that's not entirely a bad
thing and it's not the only relevant thing to be said about poetry.
There's tremendous joy in writing poetry -- in the private struggle
with one's self and one's experience of the world. I worship poetry
precisely because it's more valuable as an activity than as a
commodity to be sold. It doesn't get any better than writing poetry
for your girlfriend, but it's something else when you want to send
that poem out into the world of commerce to be consumed by strangers.
It's a delusion to think anybody out there will give a damn about
your soul, no matter how magnificent the transformative experience of
writing the poem has been for you."</TE>
<TE>   It's also worth recalling that at the very moments Wilson, Epstein
and Gioia wrote their essays, great poetry was being written by the
small number of artists in each generation who truly merit that
description.</TE>
<TE>   So there you have it: A staggering amount of poetry is being
written and most of it has value only to its author. Some of it,
however, is great and will stir its readers when Li Po's admonition
is 2,300 years old. Here, for example, are some lines presented for
no other reason than that they are wonderful and deserve to be read.
They were written a few years ago in Polish by Nobel laureate Czeslaw
Milosz during his long sojourn in Berkeley and translated into
English by former U.S. Poet laureate Robert Pinsky.</TE>
<TE>   They are a convincing summation of the wisdom to be gleaned from
the terrible century through which the world has passed and a bracing
reminder of great poetry's role in putting such lessons before our
eyes:</TE>
<TE>   Human reason is beautiful and invincible.</TE>
<TE>   No bars, no barbed wire, no pulping of books,</TE>
<TE>   No sentence of banishment can prevail against it.</TE>
<TE>   It establishes the universal ideas in language,</TE>
<TE>   And guides our hand so we write Truth and Justice</TE>
<TE>   With capital letters, lie and oppression with small.</TE>
<TE>   It puts what should be above things as they are,</TE>
<TE>   Is an enemy of despair and a friend of hope.</TE>
<TE>   It does not know Jew from Greek or slave from master,</TE>
<TE>   Giving us the estate of the world to manage.</TE>
<TE>   It saves austere and transparent phrases</TE>
<TE>   From the filthy discord of tortured words.</TE>

<HD>Design by Dogg?</HD>
<DH>In VH1's twist on home shows, Snoop redoes a fan's room
with some help. OK, a lot of help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Freudenheim</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing tall, hands lightly clenched at his sides, Snoop Dogg is
paying close attention. Hold the brush just so, stroke it like this.
House Painting 101. Not what he's used to, but he's game. Lights,
camera. Two minutes of banter as he fakes it. "I'm doing splendid,
baby doll," he coos to the designer who's guiding him. Cut. One more
time. Cut. Whew, that'll do. Where's the paint remover? He's got some
on his hand. Get it off. Quick.</LD>
<LD>   And so it goes on site with "Rock the House," VH1's foray into
home design, in which rock stars play decorator for a day so a fan
can come home to the surprise of his or her life. The artist, with
considerable input from one of two designers involved in the show,
does a make-over of a room, in Snoop's case, the theme is dogs.
Canine images everywhere, a doghouse entertainment center with "Snoop
Dogg" spray-painted (by him) over the doors and a plasma TV inside to
play his videos. Also a new plaid settee and burgundy shag rug --
Snoop's favorite '70s flavors.</LD>
<TE>   All the new stuff is given to the fan for free, and the access is
set up through a go-between mole, usually a spouse or roommate. In
the Snoop episode, which airs Monday at 10 p.m., the fan is Allison
Ising, 31, an aspiring child psychologist and dog lover. She shares a
house on a quiet street on the border of Venice and Mar Vista with
her electrician fiance, Phillip Berry, 36, who refers to her as a
"Snoopaholic." Indeed, there are a couple of Snoop posters in a
"disco room" out back, as well as a lot of smaller pictures of the
rapper on the refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for Snoop</TE>
<TE>   The day begins at 9, uh, 11 a.m., when Snoop finally rolls up in
his midnight-blue Porsche Carrera, driving himself from his Diamond
Bar home with his publicist by his side. The show's limo trails with
another half-dozen burly guys -- bodyguards or whatever. No one from
the neighborhood is watching when Snoop, 6 foot 4 in a
cranberry-colored track suit and matching running shoes, elegantly
unfurls himself from the car, which is a good thing, because the
producers take pains to keep the shoots a secret. He takes the troop
into a waiting trailer and disappears, leaving the VH1 cast and crew
biting their fingernails. Prep work is well underway, but Snoop
hasn't yet seen the designer's mock-up, and Ising will be home from
her job at a catering company around 6. The make-over has to be done
by then.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working on Snoop Time now," says the affable Richie Abbott,
the rapper's personal publicist and an employee of Priority Records,
which will release Snoop's CD "Paid Tha Cost to Be Da Bo$$" on
Tuesday, a day after his "Rock the House" first airs. Snoop is
definitely the center of this world, but the show can't really wait
for him, so the new living room is taking shape without his approval.</TE>
<TE>   "We always have contingency plans," says Kim Rozenfeld, vice
president for series development and programming at VH1 and an
executive producer of the show. He's been here for hours already,
fully anticipating that Snoop would be late. Lisa Snowdon, the show's
perky English host, and Kelly Van Patter, today's designer, have
begun filming too, with a cast of on-camera workers who have cleared
the room of its dog-eared contents and started priming the walls.</TE>
<TE>   Snoop's input so far has come from a brief questionnaire and a
phone conversation with Van Patter.</TE>
<TE>   What's your style?</TE>
<TE>   " '70s."</TE>
<TE>   What are your two favorite colors?</TE>
<TE>   "Blue, gray." (Never mind that Van Patter has done the room in
green and red.)</TE>
<TE>   Is there an overall color of your ideal room?</TE>
<TE>   "Rich."</TE>
<TE>   What one sentence sums up your style/taste?</TE>
<TE>   "Laid-back."</TE>
<TE>   Take 2</TE>
<TE>   The concept is to show a different, more homey side of the star,
the person who likes to do normal stuff and loves the fans. The fact
is, though, that this is not reality TV -- the artist is prepped,
there's a lot of acting. Snoop is clearly not a do-it-yourselfer, and
when, at about 11:30, he emerges, jacket steamed out, hair
re-braided, he knows he's going to be working, if not sweating.</TE>
<TE>   There has to be an entrance, so Snoop gets back in the Porsche and
approaches the driveway. Screech. The low-slung car scrapes a bump in
the sidewalk. Unfazed, he does it again. This time, though, he parks
parallel.</TE>
<TE>   Time to spackle. "OK, Snoop, so what we're going to do here ..."
says Van Patter, showing him how. He watches and says, "I'll say, 'I
normally wouldn't be doing this, but this is my No. 1 fan.' " Snoop
is catching on. Cameras roll, and he snaps into character. "Well,
let's spackle backle," he raps. "I want to make the house look sharp,
never crackle."</TE>
<TE>   Van Patter tells him that the spackle won't be pink when it dries.
"Oh, I thought it was going to stay pink because pink is one of my
favorite colors. I'll tell you off-camera why ...." He turns to the
camera: "Kids, don't try this at home without your parents'
permission."</TE>
<TE>   It's a kinder, gentler gangsta on display here. Snoop has quit
smoking pot, "97 days and counting," he says. He's also been working
on a pilot for an MTV show mixing comedy and music, "Doggy Fizzle
Televizzle," airing Monday at 10:30 p.m. Today, he's joking around
with everyone, and much of his chatter is about his three kids,
especially the 8-year-old, whose football team he coaches. "They call
me Coach Snoop, and when the other team runs on the field and sees
me, they get a little excited. Hopefully, it distracts them, because
we're trying to win it all," he boasts with a wink.</TE>
<TE>   He takes a few minutes to sand a door, using an electric sander.
"My wood teacher would be proud of me right now," he says to the
camera, then adds wryly: "The things I do for my fans."</TE>
<TE>   "Long strokes, as long as you make it smooth," Van Patter
instructs him. "That sounds like me, anyway," Snoop says. He's
ad-libbing, being his almost-natural self. In a back room, a dozen or
so technicians and producers hovering over monitors are smiling.
"Perfect," they murmur over and over.</TE>
<TE>   Glitz and spackle</TE>
<TE>   Marcos Siega, another executive producer, is clearly running the
production today, although no one's officially the director. He says
he wants the show to highlight the star but also provide viewers with
some how-to information. So where to buy spackle is dropped in, along
with the joshing. "It's a hybrid of a lot of things we've seen,"
Siega says of the show. "We're not telling anybody Snoop did all that
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   At 1, they want him back on camera, but he's in the trailer eating
chicken. So they forgo the shot to keep moving.</TE>
<TE>   Around 1:30 Snoop has to move to another trailer half a block away
to do an interview for another VH1 show. He's off-camera, but even
this short trip is a production. Three men walk in front of him, two
in back, and some are armed. As he strolls, a girl driving by
screams, "Snoopy!" A guy on the sidewalk on his cell says, "Snoop
Dogg is walking down my street." This is inevitable, but it is also
what the producers hoped to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   After about an hour, Snoop and entourage head back to his trailer,
where the Starbursts, Skittles and PlayStation he requested await
him. He's got some interviews for the record label lined up. It's
3:45 before he's finally back to "Rock the House," putting up some
wainscoting. He likes the now-green walls. "Green is for the money,
gold is for the honey," he says. And he wants to see Ising's disco
room.</TE>
<TE>   "She calls it 'the Snoopotheque room,' " says Ising's fiance,
Berry. "I built it for her so she could dance." She was selected for
the show not only for her devotion to Snoop, but also for her work
with at-risk children. "She believes hip-hop really makes a
difference in kids' lives," Berry says. He entered her in a contest
on the VH1 Web site for "the ultimate fan," a ploy to find people for
the show without revealing the specifics. "I can't believe I won," he
says. "The only thing I ever get is a cold, and now Snoop Dogg is in
my house with one of the best decorators in the world, and they're
giving us all this furniture."</TE>
<TE>   Snoop steps into the back room. It's filled with the former
furnishings of the living room but remains pretty threadbare. A
poster of Snoop hangs on one wall. "That's a Hugo Boss suit," he
says. "That suit cost me $6,000. And the ring, that's 2G. That's
pimpin', man."</TE>
<TE>   Time's running out</TE>
<TE>   At 4:45, the yard is full of the new furniture, and the doghouse
cabinet is being assembled. "You did everything I told you to do,"
Snoop says. He likes what he's seeing and pulls Van Patter aside to
see what she might do for his own home.</TE>
<TE>   By 5:30, it's dark outside and Van Patter is clearly panicked that
they won't finish. Berry is trying to stall Ising. Snoop is hanging
out in the kitchen, and he's a bit jumpy. He was supposed to stay
only until 6, but he's ready to wait it out. He spots a wall calendar
and marks his birthday on it. He's signing a lot of stuff that will
be hidden, to be found later. He's also thinking about how Ising will
feel when she comes home. "It's like me waking up and Elvis is
standing over me," he imagines, "singing 'Jailhouse Rock.' "</TE>
<TE>   When Ising finally arrives, is shocked, and gets to meet her hero,
her reaction is, of course, unscripted. Yet Snoop too seems genuinely
moved. He meets her dogs, stands for many pictures, and there is much
hugging. After a day staged for the cameras, this quirky hybrid of a
show ends with a real payoff -- a sweet bonding between artist and
fan that would be hard to fake.</TE>

<LD>Growing up gay in a heterosexual world can be good for the
imagination. In the already tangled sphere of day-to-day social
relations, almost everything that happens must be translated,
transmuted and transformed, to function in even the most modestly
appropriate way. The process is relentless and exhausting, but also
potentially rich in idiosyncratic delight.</LD>
<LD>   "On Wanting to Grow Horns: The Little Theater of Tom Knechtel,"
which opened last week at the Ben Maltz Gallery at Otis College of
Art and Design, builds a stunning proscenium arch around that
phantasmagoric drama. Organized by Otis gallery director Anne Ayres
and midway through a four-city tour, the show includes more than 90
paintings and drawings made since 1976. As essayist Ron Platt puts it
in the show's catalog, the work's elaborate "visual mythology" is
simultaneously alien and familiar.</LD>
<LD>   Knechtel's paintings and drawings are indeed rich and
idiosyncratic--as well as relentless and exhausting, when seen in the
abundance of a mid-career retrospective. The artist packs his work
with such voluminous incident and lush detailsthat the simple act of
looking consumes considerable energy. Imagine the jewel-like marvels
of an Indian miniature multiplied a hundredfold, or the cosmologies
of Hieronymous Bosch refracted through a prism.</LD>
<TE>   Knechtel's web-like mazes are complex when the panel is a disk 18
inches in diameter. When it's composed on a series of linked
wood-and-canvas panels 7 feet wide, the eye and mind reel.</TE>
<TE>   Rarely is there a glimpse of terra firma on which to rest in
Knechtel's acutely rendered universe of animals, masked clowns,
grotesques, self-portraits, furniture ensembles and all the rest. Air
and water are more common, and fluidity implies transience and
temporal change.</TE>
<TE>   Take "The Flood" (1993-94). A vortex of color sweeps up everything
in its path, from tiny shoes to cathedral domes, while pajama-clad
men on horseback ride the swirling wave as cuckold's horns sprout
from their heads. Nothing is at rest. Everything is a spur to another
image or activity, linked by a rhyming shape or the repetition of a
theme or color pattern.</TE>
<TE>   These visual connections among otherwise seemingly unrelated
elements function in two ways. One is narrative, the other spiritual.</TE>
<TE>   Knechtel's paintings have the quality of epic tales, but they
don't tell linear stories. "Map" (1998-99) is composed of two small
vertical panels, stacked on top of each other, one painted in fiery
yellows, reds and oranges, the other in cool blues, greens and grays.
The division between light and dark could chart day and night, heaven
and hell, good and evil, or other such familiar binaries. Mostly,
though, the shower of fantastically decorated images that tumble
through the pictorial space like an elaborate tale by Scheherazade,
in which the marvelousness of the fiction outstrips any moral.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in a large, saffron-colored canvas from 1997, Knechtel
pointedly portrays himself as "A Middle-Aged Scheherazade." A
Buddha-like figure is shown as part puzzled self-portrait, part
whimsical Falstaff--"not only witty in myself," as Shakespeare had
Prince Hal's drinking buddy declare in "Henry IV," "but the cause
that wit is in other men." The multi-armed figure wears a huge
ruffled skirt stuffed with circus paraphernalia, animals and other
exotica, which makes him the personification of a big tent. Meanwhile
the pool of water in which he stands affords him the look of a
stupendous fountain.</TE>
<TE>   The spiritual dimension of Knechtel's paintings is located in this
fecund sense of abundantly flowing life, where nothing is excluded
because everything can somehow be linked to everything else. The
sacred has little to do with ideas of purity, and the profane is not
exempted from enthusiastic embrace. The spirit is rich and diverse.</TE>
<TE>   Knechtel graduated from CalArts in 1976, when the prospect for
spiritual concerns in art was not exactly optimal. Nor, for that
matter, was the prospect for painting. But Knechtel's doggedness in
the pursuit speaks of a conviction: If the sense of social openness
in the art world of the period was authentic, then why couldn't
spiritual issues and painterly ones be addressed? There's a Victorian
quality to Knechtel's art (think of hallucinatory eccentrics such as
Richard Dadd), but it seems born of a refusal of repression (now
think of the elegant fantasies of Jean Cocteau).</TE>
<TE>   Knechtel is also known for exquisite works on paper, and the
survey is marked by an abundance of exceptional drawings in silver
point, gouache, ink, crayon and pastel. Some are working drawings for
paintings, but most are independent works of art. If the paintings
are notable for their elaborate density, the works on paper are
distinctive for their spare precision.</TE>
<TE>   Not that they're any less magical or imaginative. (When was the
last time you were presented with an anatomically convincing
rendition of a baby griffin?) The sense of a fluid life force that
courses through Knechtel's intricate, labor-intensive paintings is
encapsulated in the drawings, where a monkey's face or a sleeping cow
is rendered in splendid isolation.</TE>
<TE>   Knechtel's most powerful work uses the blank space of the paper as
a critical compositional element of the drawing. Sometimes it becomes
the glowing light that seems to illuminate the drawn figure from
within. Elsewhere a colored sheet provides dynamic contrast for the
choice of pastel. Occasionally, in a device adapted from Chinese and
Japanese brush paintings, a few fluid marks of ink on paper create a
pictorial calligraphy, occupying a distinctive realm somewhere
between writing and imagery. In any case, object and space depend on
one another.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Knechtel's drawings seem straightforward, but the more you
look, the more complex and strange they become. A delicately rendered
monkey's paw is tied with a pink ribbon, while the rearing head of a
horse is rendered Venetian-style, in red chalk on green paper.
Applied adornment is a human urge, which takes on uncanny powers when
encountered in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   One of the largest and most remarkable drawings in the show mines
related decorative territory. A mustachioed muscleman, shown from the
waist up with arms crossed and looking like a 19th century
bare-knuckle boxer, wears an elaborate, four-layer ruff around his
neck. He's somewhere between a Van Dyck aristocrat and an abject
modern circus clown. But the determined glower on his face, together
with the formidable bulge of his bicep, suggests that one could mock
his elegant sartorial embellishment only at one's peril. He's beauty
and the beast, all rolled up in one -- and a luscious marker of
Knechtel's singular aesthetic.</TE>

<HD>What's behind this ugly Hitler-fest?</HD>

<LD>Move over Brad Pitt and Robert Redford. Judging by the article in
last Sunday's Calendar ("The many faces of Hitler," by Elaine Dutka),
the new look features brown eyes, brown hair -- and a brown uniform.</LD>
<LD>   When Broadway producer/hustler/gigolo Max Bialystock faced
financial ruin in Mel Brooks' "The Producers," he realized that only
one kind of entertainment could save him: a lavish musical with
dancing girls dressed in SS uniforms to set the stage for the hero,
Adolf Hitler.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood's fortunes have declined since Sept. 11, but the latest
news from screen city shows that deep-pocketed producers have
unexpectedly reached Bialystock's pathetic situation. They now follow
his example to raise their sagging fortunes.</LD>
<TE>   Lions Gate is releasing "Max," a movie that explores Hitler's
early life in Vienna as an aspiring artist and his fictional
relationship with an equally fictional Jewish art dealer. The
rejected artist syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   CBS is developing a four-hour miniseries based on Ian Kershaw's
book, which will follow the Fuhrer's youth and subsequent rise to
power as leader of the Third Reich. Kershaw's important work takes
two volumes and nearly 2,000 pages to analyze Hitler's social,
political and intellectual life, and the murderous violence to which
he dedicated that life. Not so the CBS drama. It will show the misery
Hitler endured at the hands of his father. The abused child syndrome.
Poor Hitler. Poor Germany.</TE>
<TE>   These are but two of a crop of disturbing new movies that attempt
to exploit the media-genic Fuhrer. To Max Bialystock's credit, he
assumed that he could make off with his investors' money because a
Hitler musical would flop the first day: No one would wish to see it.
Not so his successors. They expect these productions to succeed. And
so they will spend millions on advertising that will bring the face
of the Fuhrer to our billboards and, through TV commercials and movie
trailers, to audiences everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, a young and energetic British writer named David
Irving believed that the time had come to make a case for Hitler.
Irving argued that in the court of history, Hitler had had too many
prosecutors, and no serious defender. So he tracked down people who
remembered "the other Hitler," and found Hitler's secretary, Traudl
Junge, who taught him to see the war through Hitler's eyes, to
champion his perspective.</TE>
<TE>   The result was "Hitler's War" (1977). In it, Irving argued that
the Holocaust had been enacted by "criminal elements" behind Hitler's
back and without his knowledge or approval. According to Irving,
"Hitler was the best friend the Jews had in the Third Reich." The
puppet tyrant syndrome. Poor, misunderstood Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   As the announcements from the movie industry show, those who shape
popular culture are at the crossroads Irving reached in the 1970s.
Indeed, the same Traudl Junge who inspired Irving now inspires
Austrian director Andre Heller's new film, "Blind Spot: Hitler's
Secretary."</TE>
<TE>   These filmmakers chose Hitler as their subject because of the mass
murders he plotted and produced. In their productions, however, they
-- like Irving -- focus on poor, misunderstood Hitler. And they
willfully ignore his atrocities. These are dangerous seeds indeed.
They can bear but one fruit: denial.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting the focus to Hitler as the abused child, or Hitler as the
rejected aspiring artist, horribly distorts a history of evil and
terror. Now the story is about the personal pain Hitler endured and
not about the murder he unleashed across a continent.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Irving, a British High Court judge decided in 2000
that his career from Hitler apologist to Holocaust denier had been
shaped by profound anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   It is unfathomable that these new Hollywood productions would also
be shaped by profound anti-Semitism. So the question we now face is,
do they merely pander to a culture that will do what audiences never
did before: embrace a picture of Hitler in which the Holocaust has
been airbrushed away?</TE>

<LD>The former public housing project where Elvis Presley lived as a
teenager is undergoing a major renovation.</LD>
<LD>   The former Lauderdale Courts will become Uptown Square, a
347-apartment complex with rent-subsidized and nonsubsidized
apartments. The site is several blocks north of the downtown business
district.</LD>
<LD>   A plaque noting that Presley's family lived at Lauderdale Courts
-- and that Elvis practiced his guitar in the basement laundry room
-- went on display this week. The Presleys lived at the project from
1949 to 1953.</LD>

<KH>JAZZ REVIEW</KH>
<HD>A night of stylistic versatility</HD>
<DH>For his Zony Mash project, keyboardist Wayne Horvitz
provides diverse compositions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keyboardist Wayne Horvitz is one of the busiest artists in the
increasingly diversified crossover areas surrounding jazz where he
works as a composer, arranger, performer and producer. Active in the
Seattle music scene, he was also one of the founders, in the
mid-'80s, of the New York Composers Orchestra.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday night, Horvitz brought yet another of his many musical
projects to Rocco's. The ensemble -- named Zony Mash after a Meters
song -- consisted of Horvitz on piano and organ, Timothy Young on
guitar, Keith Lowe on bass and Andy Roth on drums. Much of the music,
all of it offered without announcement or identification, was drawn
from the band's latest album, "Live in Seattle."</LD>
<LD>   Horvitz's diverse compositions ranged from jam-band-like jump
music to a number based on an arching melody line reminiscent of
Lennie Tristano, from funk-filled groove rhythms to -- unexpectedly
-- a pastoral piece rich with lush, impressionistic dissonances.</LD>
<TE>   Zony Mash is not a band of virtuosic soloists. In brief
improvisational forays, each member executed ideas with
craftsman-like skill. But their most valuable assets traced to the
colorful range of stylistic notions within Horvitz's compositions,
combined with the smoothly integrated, ensemble manner in which they
were performed.</TE>
<TE>   The Zony Mash program, which was to be repeated Friday with the
addition of singer-composer Robin Holcomb, was one of a growing
number of cutting-edge performances place at Rocco's, which has been
temporarily relocated (because of construction work) to the Lillian
Theatre, 1076 N. Lillian Way. The appearance of saxophonist Steve
Coleman on Tuesday and Wednesday brings one of Manhattan's most
important jazz avant-garde artists to the Southland for a rare local
concert.</TE>

<HD>A Martin and Lewis chemistry analysis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were the oddest of couples. Yet from 1946 through 1956, Dean
Martin and Jerry Lewis had no peers when it came to comedy teams.
Spontaneous, crazy, joyous and exuberant, Martin and Lewis were the
toast of nightclubs, headlined the NBC variety series "The Colgate
Comedy Hour" and made 16 movies.</LD>
<LD>   And now, their tumultuous relationship is chronicled in the CBS
movie "Martin and Lewis." Emmy-winner Sean Hayes of "Will &amp; Grace"
plays the insecure, obsessive Lewis, and British actor Jeremy Northam
("Gosford Park," "Emma") plays the suave, self-assured but
emotionally detached Martin.</LD>
<LD>   Jeanne Martin, the entertainer's second wife, who was married to
him from 1949 to 1973, says that the duo had more fun on stage than
anybody in the audience. "I don't think they even looked at the
audience or played to the audience," she says. "They just played to
each other. It's such a shame that they never filmed their
[nightclub] act. It was such a time of discovery and magic, and each
one just amazed the other. It was awesome to watch it."</LD>
<TE>   Before they paired up for the first time in July 1946 in Atlantic
City -- a few months earlier they had appeared during each other's
acts in a New York City club -- Martin was a rising young singer from
Steubenville, Ohio, who had been a boxer and toiled at odd jobs
before finding his voice. Lewis, who was eight years younger than
Martin, was filled with so much self-doubt that he would do pantomime
on stage so he wouldn't have to talk to the crowd. The movie portrays
Lewis yearning for acceptance because his father, also a comic, had
little faith in his son's ability. "They just stumbled onto each
other in Atlantic City, and [their relationship] developed
immediately," Jeanne Martin says. "That is where the magic comes in.
It was just supposed to be."</TE>
<TE>   Writer-director John Gray (who directed the TV movie "Haven" ) was
a fan of both men individually but knew very little about their
partnership when he was hired by executive producers Craig Zadan and
Neil Meron. "But I was fascinated with that era, and the whole notion
of this one guy who desperately needed the friendship and approval of
this enigmatic figure and, when he can't get it, seems like he's
going to try to destroy it."</TE>
<TE>   So Gray spent months poring through books and watching their
films, such as "My Friend Irma," "The Caddy" and "Jumping Jacks," and
"Colgate Comedy Hour" episodes. Writing the movie was difficult, he
says, "because there is no record of their nightclub act. Even people
who were there, including Jerry, aren't able to say specifically what
they did together other than they had this amazing chemistry. They
ran into the crowd and did stuff, so it was very difficult to try to
come up with physical stuff for them to do."</TE>
<TE>   Gray talked with Jeanne Martin while writing the script but not
Lewis. That came later.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected Jerry to be adversarial because he had his own HBO
movie," Gray explains. "Indeed, we were getting lawyers' letters when
the trades broke we were doing the movie. And then I got this call
from Jerry because he had read the script and really loved the
script, and then we started speaking. He was my new best friend. But
I was impressed with him because he never asked me to change
anything. It's not a totally flattering portrait of Jerry. I don't
think we tried to pull any punches in the movie. I just really feel
like it is a really brave thing for him to get behind the movie. Now,
he's seen it and really loves it."</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Martin has also seen the finished product but says she
really can't be objective about it. "I must say they did a wonderful
job of the production and the story," she adds. "I don't know if I am
seeing a little more passion for Jerry in this and a little more
disdain for Dean. I thought I felt that, but then again maybe I just
have to see it again."</TE>
<TE>   The film does capture Martin's aloofness. "Nobody really got to
know him," Jeanne Martin says. "He loved doing the nightclub work. He
loved being on stage. He loved doing westerns because he could be
outdoors. His background was completely different than Jerry's, so
for him, he did his work and then he wanted to play golf.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always a loner. I saw home movies of him when he was 16 or
17 with his cousins. The guys are playing football, and the camera
pans over and Dean is sitting there whittling. He was not a joiner."</TE>
<TE>   But, she says, he was funny at home and marvelous with his
children. "He absolutely stood behind me in raising these seven
children. He sat down at dinner every night at 6. That was one of the
rules we had, and we always did."</TE>
<TE>   Both Hayes and Northam were intimidated about playing these stars.
"This is kind of why you do it, because it is so scary," says Hayes,
who plays the outrageous Jack on "Will &amp; Grace." "Moving out here in
a broken-down car in 1995 to Los Angeles is scary, but you do it. To
me, you are not living life if all you do is live safely."</TE>
<TE>   Northam says he's nervous about even doing publicity for the film
because "having played him, you always feel people think you are good
at doing it, or you somehow cracked something about him, or have a
special relationship with this almost legendary person who is so
loved by so many people. I really, genuinely hope we haven't offended
people who knew these characters. I think it is a well-meaning piece.
It doesn't seek to take any shortcuts. It takes the relationship as
the center issue, and I think it looks at it quite unsentimentally."</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Martin says the team's balance changed once they came to
Paramount Pictures in 1949 to make "My Friend Irma."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a progression that one would expect," she says. "But it
was a fateful one as far as a team, because they were no longer
together. Nothing was spontaneous [in the movies]. They made quite a
few films together, and in that time span Jerry became obsessed with
filmmaking, and he loved every aspect of it. He loved every day on
the set, and Dean didn't like any days they were on the set."</TE>
<TE>   Many films followed but the die was cast. "They both had different
roads to travel," she says.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The job seems impossible from the start: As a nonfiction judge for
the National Book Awards, you get six months to read some 400 books
on everything from environmental science to backroom politics.</LD>
<LD>   At least one of this year's voters, columnist and television
commentator Michael Kinsley, says he didn't even try.</LD>
<LD>   In a column posted Thursday on the online magazine Slate, Kinsley
acknowledged he looked at only a fraction of the submissions. He
likened the awards to choosing "the best rhubarb pie at the state
fair" and hinted that he didn't complete Wednesday's winner: Robert
A. Caro's 1,000-page "Master of the Senate," the third volume of his
Lyndon B. Johnson biography.</LD>
<TE>   The chairman of the nonfiction panel, Christopher Merrill, said
Kinsley was only speaking for himself. But neither he nor Neil
Baldwin, executive director of the National Book Foundation, claimed
every book was read in its entirety.</TE>

<LD>THANK you, Robert Hilburn ("Is bad news drowning out rap's positive
beat?" Nov. 16) for reminding readers to not blame hip-hop music in
response to two recent incidents associated with the hip-hop
community (the shooting of Jam Master Jay and the arrest of three of
Suge Knight's associates).</LD>
<LD>   I teach hip-hop culture to middle school and high school youth
throughout Los Angeles. My goal is very similar to the statements
made by Hilburn: Hip-hop is an incredibly powerful and positive
influence. What adults and youth alike see on television and hear on
the radio is maybe only 10% of an incredibly rich musical culture.
Like Hilburn, I would say that good hip-hop is as "liberating as
Hendrix's guitar or Dylan's words."</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I share Robert Hilburn's lament that all those distracting
murders, attempted murders, assaults, drug arrests and gun violations
in the rap community are getting in the way of celebrating Eminem's
triumph as he spreads the "positive beat" of rap music as a "vital
American art form."</TE>
<TE>   People are just goofy to harbor negative feelings about rap
because, as Hilburn states so musically, the Nov. 8 murder of Jam
Master Jay and the LAPD shakedown of Suge Knight's Tha Row Records
are "two very separate incidents" (cough).</TE>
<TE>   Of course, I'd be more confident in my (and Hilburn's) position if
it weren't for the human carnage on display in the ever-expanding
body count.</TE>
<TE>   Professional showbiz nannies like Rob Reiner step over the bloody
bodies of young, dead black men as they condemn smoking in movies.
This would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad.</TE>
<TE>   Only if Placido Domingo gunned down Luciano Pavarotti, Bobby Short
disemboweled Michael Feinstein or Alan Jackson's band mowed down
Vince Gill in a Memphis drive-by, would the music community, social
do-gooders and the American public demand that something be done
about such an industry of death.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, the spiraling murder rate within rap music is laughably
dismissed as being "very separate incidents."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, right.</TE>

<LD>THE fact that Caltech President David Baltimore rejected the

simultaneously laugh and cry ("Caltech rejects Serra's massive wall
sculpture," by Bettijane Levine, Nov. 16).</LD>

lacks.</LD>

within five miles of the museum -- they don't feel the location of
the Southwest Museum is isolated.</LD>

rehabilitated Watts Tower isolated? Is the Huntington Museum and

<LD>I do not understand why William Langewiesche is being attacked for
simply telling us what he observed in the aftermath of Sept. 11 ("A
firestorm over hallowed ground," by J. Michael Kennedy, Nov. 19). The
idea that all police, fire, rescue and emergency personnel are, by
definition, brave, honest, ethical and heroic is laughable! These are
professions, and as with all professions, the vast majority are good
people trying to make the world a better place; and a minority are
abusive, corrupt, dishonest, arrogant, repulsive and think of
themselves as above the law.</LD>
<LD>   Langewiesche's responsibility as a journalist is to report what he
sees, not sugarcoat it to fit the New York Fire Department's public
relations profile. The real question is, why do these public service
agencies feel the need to discredit anyone who dares to question
whether there are unworthy members within their ranks?</LD>

<LD>IN reply to Gail Giberson's response to Brian Lowry's column about
"The West Wing" (Letters, Nov. 16), indicating her inability to hear
and understand what was going on: May I suggest that she, and other
viewers having the same problem, utilize the "closed captioning"
feature of their TVs? She will then appreciate and enjoy "The West
Wing" as much as I do.</LD>
<LD>   Since I discovered its advantages, I am able to "read" the
dialogue whether mumbled, spoken too fast or poorly enunciated. I
also utilize that feature when renting videotapes with English-,
Irish- or Australian-accented dialogue that can be difficult for some
Americans to understand.</LD>

<LD>Secular and ecumenical delights decorate "Nuncrackers: The Nunsense
Christmas Musical," receiving its local premiere at the Fremont
Centre Theatre in South Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   Dan Goggin's 1998 holiday entry in his popular franchise attains
heavenly levels of irreverent mirth, leavened by genuine sweetness.</LD>
<LD>   A Publisher's Clearing House windfall has funded a public access
studio in the Mount Saint Helen's Convent basement, where the
eternally fund-raising Little Sisters of Hoboken prepare for their
first television special. But these nuns are inundated with crises.</LD>
<TE>   Sister Mary Paul, alias Amnesia (Leah Stanko-Mangum), oversees
caroling students while confusing "wassail" with "waffle."
Brooklyn-born Sister Robert Anne (Rebecca George) is continually
waylaid from performing by the Reverend Mother Mary Regina (Rende Rae
Norman).</TE>
<TE>   She, along with pragmatic Sister Mary Hubert (Haneefah Wood),
struggles to maintain the order's order. Meanwhile, visiting Father
Virgil (Michael Edwin) reluctantly replaces missing Sister Julia,
Child of God, in her cooking segment.</TE>
<TE>   "Nunsense" veteran Mary-Pat Green's deft, deliberately hokey
staging supports Goggin's real-time twists, as Gary Mattison's
musical direction and Karen Byers-Blackwell's choreography buoy the
gleefully generic songs.</TE>
<TE>   The keen designs are deceptively makeshift, and the cast is
delightful. Norman suggests a conflation of Faith Prince and Betty
White, along with Stanko-Mangum, George and Wood revealing first-rate
vocal and comic chops.</TE>
<TE>   Edwin is hysterical, and the children are both adorable and
toe-curling.</TE>
<TE>   The most fun to be had with a nun outside of "Late Night

<HD>Ovation Awards begin a new act</HD>
<DH>Some voting procedure changes make their debut as peers
rate 348 L.A.-area productions. Ceremony is Sunday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the biggest theater game in town.</LD>
<LD>   We're talking about Theatre LA's Ovation Awards, L.A.'s only
peer-judged professional theater competition.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, judging from how many productions are eligible, the
Ovations tower over some much better-known competitions. For the
2001-02 Ovations, to be presented Sunday at L.A.'s Orpheum Theatre,
348 productions vied. That easily tops the numbers of shows that were
eligible for the 2002 Tony Awards (32), Joseph Jefferson Awards in
Chicago (237, in two competitions) or Helen Hayes Awards in
Washington (181).</LD>
<TE>   The Ovations lack the televised visibility and commercial
influence of the Tonys. In L.A., with only rare exceptions,
Ovation-nominated shows have closed before the awards ceremony
occurs, so immediate box office dividends are not likely.</TE>
<TE>   But the Ovations have had other effects. James Blackman, who runs
Civic Light Opera of South Bay Cities, brought a cluster of about 20
civic leaders from Redondo Beach to the Ovations ceremony in 2000, at
the Ahmanson Theatre. When he accepted a production award, he looked
out at his guests and asked, "Can I have my lobby now?"</TE>
<TE>   Yes, they replied -- within months the city was financing an
$11-million renovation of the lobby and other areas within the
Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center, where Blackman's group
performs. The renovation is now complete. And Blackman gives the
Ovations at least partial credit.</TE>
<TE>   This year's Ovation nominees emerged from the biggest procedural
changes since the Ovations became competitive awards in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   For 2001-02, a rule that prohibited voters from assessing
contenders with whom they shared ties of "blood, love or money" was
removed on the grounds that it couldn't be policed. The only remnant
of the rule is that voters have to be able to see the entire
production from the audience; actors, for example, are not supposed
to vote for any elements of shows in which they were onstage.</TE>
<TE>   Sound designer and Ovation voter Bob Blackburn gave himself a 9
for his design of "Street Stories," which he thought was his best
work of the year, and for which he indeed was nominated. He also
rated his work on several other shows, giving himself a 5 for his
worst effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised when they said you could vote for yourself," he
said. He noted that experiencing his shows several times was
different from experiencing other shows only once. He voted on 26
shows, generally rating his competition in the 5-to-7 range.</TE>
<TE>   However, lighting designer and voter Rand Ryan said he didn't vote
on productions on which he worked, in part because "I'm a harsher
critic of myself than I would be of someone else. It's probably
better just to experience a show instead of knowing what happened up
to opening night."</TE>
<TE>   Also in 2001-02, the number of potential nominees in categories
with more than 50 contenders was raised from five to seven, and the
number of potential winners in these categories grew from one to
three. The actual number of winners won't be known until Sunday, said
Jon Lawrence Rivera, who headed the committee that changed the rule;
it will depend on how the contenders' mean scores are clustered. If
contender A has a 9.9, contender B has a 9.8 and contenders C and D
each scored 9.6, only A and B would win.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing the number of honors in well-populated categories
"reflects more of what is the best of L.A. theater," Rivera said.</TE>
<TE>   But director and former Ovation winner Tracy Young said multiple
winners "might dilute some of the prestige" of the award. Several
Ovation observers said they would wait and see if they like this rule
change until they see how long the ceremony is extended because of
extra acceptance speeches.</TE>
<TE>   The voting pool was enlarged last year from 121 to 188. Potential
voters were asked to list several highlights of their L.A.
theatergoing in an attempt to make sure that the voters' theatergoing
was geographically diverse. Shashin Desai, whose International City
Theatre in Long Beach had once withdrawn from the Ovations because so
few voters ventured to Long Beach, said he was satisfied with voter
turnout in 2001-02; at least 10 voters showed up for each production,
compared to none "or maybe one" several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   As of last July, the latest date for which figures were complete,
86% of the registered shows had been seen by the required minimum of
eight voters.</TE>
<TE>   A few companies still don't lure enough voters to qualify or don't
participate. Bilingual Foundation of the Arts withdrew several years
ago because voters failed to appear or unwittingly turned up at
Spanish-language performances without being able to understand
Spanish, said president Carmen Zapata.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Davis, a former voter and former Theatre LA board member,
said "no one ever came to see our shows" at her Towne Street Theatre,
so the company dropped out. Kosmond Russell's Stage 52 participates
in the Ovations but never gets enough voters to qualify, he said.
Both Towne Street and Stage 52 are African American companies and
active participants in the NAACP Theatre Awards. Russell said he
feels black and white theater voters sometimes "get in comfort zones
and have a tendency not to reach out. It's not a proper approach;
it's just the easiest approach."</TE>
<TE>   The Evidence Room, one of L.A.'s most famous smaller theaters,
stopped registering its shows for Ovations. Although artistic
director Bart DeLorenzo applauds Theatre LA, the voters "were a hard
group of people to deal with." He found himself distributing ballots
and free tickets to actors who had been turned down for roles in the
same shows they were judging. With different voters seeing different
sets of shows, it's "a very strange process," he said. "But it's not
like I have a better idea of how it should be done."</TE>
<TE>   After eight voters have seen a show, a producer can stop issuing
free tickets and ballots to additional voters. Actress and director
Jacque Lynn Colton voted on 128 productions in 2001-02 -- more than
any other voter. "It was like being in heaven," she said, but she
still found some productions closed to her because of producers'
"first come, first served" policies. Other producers don't give the
Ovation voters very good seats, she noted. A former Tony voter, she
said the New York producers gave voters great seats.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Ed Gaynes, a former Tony and Ovations voter, agreed that
shows "should be open to all voters, not just the first eight. That's
too easy to manipulate. The Ovations would be more exalted if
producers treated it as important."</TE>
<TE>   Producer Geo Hartley had scheduled his musical "Twisted" to open
last August, a week before the end of the Ovations year. After
publicizing his show to Ovation voters, he was confident he had
enough Ovation voters' reservations before the end of August for the
show to qualify. He was nervous when he had to postpone the opening
until Aug. 31, but 11 voters responded that yes, they could move
their reservations to that one night.</TE>
<TE>   That night, however, he received a call shortly before show time
from actress Frankie Anne. She was in an auto accident. Hartley said
he was willing to cancel the performance, but Anne vowed that she
would make it on time. A witness to the accident drove her to the
theater. She favored her uninjured leg when she danced. At
intermission, one of the voters had to leave because of apparent
labor pains. But 10 remained, and the show was rewarded with one
Ovation nomination, for world premiere musical.</TE>
<TE>   Hartley said Anne's words from the accident site are hard to
forget. "I've gotta be there for the Ovation voters," she said.</TE>

<HD>JFK and PT-109: the tale still stirs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a World War II warship, PT-109 was not destined to be much
remembered. It was sunk ingloriously in a misbegotten South Pacific
mission in which nothing went right and nary a blow was struck at the
enemy.</LD>
<LD>   But the commanding officer -- an adventuresome rich kid from
Harvard -- later was elected president of the United States, and the
tale of PT-109 and the guts and leadership shown by the young Navy
lieutenant in saving his crew became part of American lore.</LD>
<LD>   It's a story that has been told innumerable times, but a marvelous
National Geographic documentary, "The Search for Kennedy's PT-109"
(Sunday at 8 p.m. on MSNBC), brings it alive with strong narration
and vivid photography.</LD>
<TE>   The frame of "Search" is the attempt by underwater explorer Robert
D. Ballard to find the boat's wreckage in 1,300 feet of water in the
Solomon Sea. It was there, on the foggy night of Aug. 2, 1943, that a
patrol torpedo boat commanded by 26-year-old Lt. j.g. John F. Kennedy
was sliced in twain by a Japanese destroyer running at 30 knots
without lights.</TE>
<TE>   For six days, Kennedy tended his crew, some badly injured, as they
avoided capture and prayed for rescue.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy declared the crew dead and held a memorial. But two
Solomon Island natives, sent out in their canoe by an Australian
coast-watcher, found Kennedy and the 10 other survivors. (Two crew
members had been killed.)</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most emotional moments of "Search" involve Matthew
Maxwell Taylor Kennedy, the son of Robert Kennedy, who went to the
Solomons for the filming. He meets the two natives, one of whom named
one of his children John F. Kennedy and keeps a jungle shrine to JFK.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, an environmental studies professor at Boston College,
asks Dick Keresey, who commanded PT-105 in the same squadron, why the
PT-109 was so quickly forgotten and its crew presumed dead. The
answer is matter of fact but chilling: Death was a common commodity.</TE>
<TE>   After the rescue, Kennedy wrote archly to his parents that the
officials who presumed he was dead "fortunately ... misjudged the
durability of the Kennedys."</TE>
<TE>   The hunt for the sunken boat is interesting, but the examination
of that Kennedy durability is what gives "Search" its power.</TE>

<HD>Britain tunes in to follow voting returns</HD>
<DH>A viewer poll pulls in millions of Britons to vote for
their country's greatest historical figure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Wallace</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>In an era when people are exercising their right to vote more
vigorously over reality TV shows than, say, the congressional
midterms, it is refreshing to discover television producers are still
capable of putting something intelligent on the ballot for us once in
a while.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, you have to be in Britain to see it. Sunday night, at
least 4 million viewers (proportionally, that's equivalent to about
18 million Americans) are expected to tune in to BBC2 for the final
night of "Great Britons," an interactive show taking a digital straw
poll on which Briton is the greatest figure in the country's history.</LD>
<LD>   Shakespeare or Churchill? Darwin or John Lennon? It sounds like
the sort of slurry pub argument you'd want to beat a retreat from
after a while -- especially since the late Princess Diana has also
sneaked into contention. But in the hands of the BBC it has become
part of the national conversation in Britain, a smart, entertaining
competition that proves television viewers will tune in and vote on
more challenging fare than which annoying hard body to toss off an
island.</LD>
<TE>   The scheme is so simple it could have come from a game played to
amuse the family on long drives -- which, in a way, it did. The
concept springs from a mind game that Jane Root, the head of BBC2,
devised to pass time with her father, James, while they both sat in a
hospital waiting room after her mother became ill two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I just asked Dad which Briton he thought was the greatest of all
time -- 'Not Churchill,' he said right away, he doesn't like
Churchill -- and we just talked on and on about it," recalls Root.
From conversation to television was an easy step: The 10 finalists
were simply the top vote-getters from nominations submitted by the
public, a process that left plenty of grand names -- from Henry VIII
to Margaret Thatcher and current soccer star David Beckham -- out of
the finals. The BBC then commissioned a documentary or dramatized
show on each of the top 10, presented by an advocate from politics,
media or celebrity academia.</TE>
<TE>   It has been running twice a week for five weeks, with viewers
voting by telephone, the Internet or through their digital TVs after
each show.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to do some proper television for a while. It shows
there is a mass of intelligent people out there not being served by
one more 'Celebrity Big Brother,' " says Jeremy Clarkson, a
well-known television presenter, as they are called here, who stayed
at the BBC to do "Britons." Clarkson championed Isambard Kingdom
Brunel, the Victorian engineer who built the ports and bridges that
defined Britain's Industrial Age.</TE>
<TE>   But Diana "still has a shout" at first place, says Clarkson.
Billed as the compassionate candidate who finally taught the British
how to emote, the late princess has stayed stubbornly second
throughout, just ahead of Churchill and far ahead of serious
candidates like Adm. Horatio Nelson and Isaac Newton.</TE>
<TE>   "Diana still has a following, especially among all those
9,000-year-olds watching," Clarkson says. "But that's OK. She's
splitting the old vote that would otherwise go to Churchill, that
drunken Kurd killer." It is a passing sneer at the violence of
Churchill-led military campaigns in the Middle East, but Clarkson is
mostly kidding. He actually thinks Churchill has the best shot at
catching Brunel on Sunday night, when the 10 advocates gather for a
live, final, two-hour free-for-all that will conclude with a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Who would have figured a show pitting a Victorian engineer in a
stovepipe hat against a pop princess would find an audience?</TE>

<HD>Small Firms in a Struggle to Stay Aloft</HD>
<DH>Southland's aircraft parts suppliers feel effects of the
sharp slowdown in orders for commercial jetliners</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The factory floor at LeFiell Manufacturing Co. in Santa Fe Springs
can be a lonely place.</LD>
<LD>   On a recent afternoon a LeFiell employee rotated between three
large machines to forge and grind a titanium rod for a Boeing
jetliner, tackling the work once done by three people. The machines
grew intermittently quiet, and the dull hum of a nearby freeway often
was louder than the noise being generated inside.</LD>
<LD>   Amid one of the worst slumps to hit the commercial aircraft
business in decades, LeFiell has cut its work force by nearly half to
135 employees and slashed production to two-thirds capacity. Its
executives worry daily about having to make even more reductions if a
recovery doesn't come soon.</LD>
<TE>   "We really don't have a long-term strategy," said LeFiell Chairman
George Ray, a 41-year company veteran, as he led a tour of the
near-empty facility. "From day to day, our strategic plan is
basically about survival."</TE>
<TE>   Surviving is the operative word for thousands of small local
aerospace suppliers that have seen the commercial aircraft business
crumble since last year's terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The airline industry, facing a $7-billion loss this year amid a
travel slump, has taken a record number of planes out of service and
new orders largely have disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Aircraft makers, such as Boeing Co. and Airbus, in turn have shed
workers by the thousands.</TE>
<TE>   But hardest hit in many ways have been the smaller parts suppliers
-- those with fewer than 500 employees -- because they tend to make
just a handful of products and rely on only a few customers.</TE>
<TE>   "Half a year ago, people said this was similar or a little less
severe than other downturns. But now it may turn out to be more
severe than anything we had before," said Adam Pilarski, former chief
financial officer for McDonnell Douglas Co. (now a part of Boeing)
and a director at Avitas Inc., an aviation research firm.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a pretty picture out there."</TE>
<TE>   There is little doubt that Boeing and its larger parts suppliers,
with their broader mix of products, will weather the downturn,
analysts say. But the future is less certain for the smaller firms --
a situation that could have a noticeable impact on the regional
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California is home to more small aerospace suppliers than
any other place in the world. All told California has 26,000
aerospace firms -- a vast majority of them in the Southland -- that
collectively employ nearly 300,000 workers, more than any other
state.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, companies that are heavily focused on defense-related
work are doing just fine. And with the specter of war in Iraq, the
Pentagon budget is increasing 14% this fiscal year, marking the
biggest jump in two decades.</TE>
<TE>   So LeFiell and other parts suppliers are turning to a strategy
used by defense contractors in the early 1990s when a dramatic slump
in Pentagon spending threatened to shutter their production lines.</TE>
<TE>   One-quarter of local defense contractors went out of business from
1990 to 1994, and those that hung on did so by slashing their work
forces, increasing productivity and expanding into the commercial
aerospace market.</TE>
<TE>   This time, aerospace suppliers are repeating the first two steps,
but they've turned the third on its head: They are desperately trying
to land more defense work to offset the slump on the commercial side.</TE>
<TE>   Little Optimism</TE>
<TE>   Boeing -- LeFiell's biggest customer -- said last month that it
doesn't expect a recovery in new jet orders until 2004. But it might
be three or four more years before orders really pick up for
companies such as LeFiell, because the Chicago aerospace giant first
will look to exhaust its parts inventory.</TE>
<TE>   LeFiell has long supplied new and replacement engine struts,
shafts and braces for Boeing 737, 767 and 777 jetliners.</TE>
<TE>   This year, LeFiell's revenue is expected to slide to about $20
million, down from $33 million two years ago, with about half of its
business from commercial orders.</TE>
<TE>   Adapting to a changing market is nothing new for LeFiell. When the
company opened in the 1930s, it was making metal conveyors for the
meat packing industry. It turned to manufacturing high-tech rocket
engine parts and missile cases during the defense boom of the 1950s
and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   In the current downturn, LeFiell engineers are hoping to use their
skills at turning out slender, straw-like fuel tubes for rocket
engines to expand into whole new markets.</TE>
<TE>   Among them: medical devices and perhaps even artificial organs.
But above all, the company is aggressively going after more military
work, bidding on parts contracts for missiles and F-15 jets, hoping
to double its defense revenue to about 30% next year.</TE>
<TE>   A similar strategy is underway in Chatsworth at Sensor Systems
Inc., which manufactures aircraft antennas for Boeing and other
aircraft makers. Until the terrorist attack, about 80% of Sensor's
revenue came from antenna sales for passenger airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the slump, the family-owned company has cut its work
force to 200, down from 265 at the start of the year. Meanwhile,
Sensor has made a significant push to sell antennas to the Pentagon
and overseas customers.</TE>
<TE>   It also created a marketing department for the first time in its
41-year history and doubled its foreign sales staff to six. In the
past, Sensor's primary owner relied on his long-standing relationship
with a few customers to sell his products.</TE>
<TE>   Sensor also has bolstered its research activities, hiring
engineers with doctorates to develop military versions of its
antennas, notably for the global positioning system. GPS navigation
signals can help fighter and bomber pilots figure out where they are,
but the system has been vulnerable to jamming by adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   Sensor is trying to land contracts to provide GPS antennas with
special encryption technology. At the moment, defense contracts
account for about 25% of Sensor's sales, but the company hopes that
will rise to 35% next year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's slowly chugging along," said Frank Webb, Sensor's vice
president for operations. "We've been getting a lot of quotes,
proposals and have been sending out a lot of samples. If our
expectations come to pass, it will bring us back or perhaps even
exceed what we were doing last year."</TE>
<TE>   Still, for LeFiell and other firms even a boost in their defense
businesses may not be enough the fill the gap.</TE>
<TE>   "Defense will be up a little, but that's not expected to offset
the loss on the commercial side," Ray said. "There are just not
enough new programs out there."</TE>
<TE>   Tough Times</TE>
<TE>   LeFiell is owned by its workers under an employee stock ownership
plan, and management has persuaded the staff to do all it can to help
the company endure. Employees have volunteered to work only four days
a week, and they've also agreed to a pay cut, saving 35 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "They basically wanted to share the pain," said Venkat Raman,
LeFiell's president and chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the number of LeFiell executives was cut to
three from seven, and those remaining are looking at a possible drop
in pay.</TE>
<TE>   The company has pushed myriad other money-saving measures, as
well, including retraining the remaining workers to do the jobs of
those who have been laid off. So instead of one person overseeing
three steps to make jet engine shafts, that employee may now handle
seven steps, encompassing the entire manufacturing process.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take some new thinking to figure out how to
survive," said the 62-year-old Ray, who has lost count of all the
aviation boom-and-bust cycles he has seen. "We've been through this
before and I think we'll be able to get through it again."</TE>

<HD>Nissan Tested Altima Air Bag Replacement</HD>
<DH>The automaker says customer relations and not safety
prompted work on a substitute. The device has been linked to eye
injuries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myron Levin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nissan Motor Co. has quietly developed a possible replacement for air
bags in some of its Altima cars that are linked to severe eye
injuries, newly disclosed documents show, even though the automaker
has publicly denied there is any safety problem.</LD>
<LD>   A least 40 people have suffered eye injuries or blindness when
passenger-side air bags deployed in the Altimas, often in minor
crashes, say safety groups and lawyers for people who have sued
Torrance-based Nissan North America Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Since March 2001, federal safety regulators have been conducting
an investigation, which could lead to the recall of nearly 200,000
cars.</LD>
<TE>   Though Nissan maintains that the air bags are as safe as those in
other cars, documents show that the company began developing a
possible replacement two years ago -- even before federal authorities
began their safety investigation.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Nissan memo to the government, the company has
ordered and tested several of the potential substitute air bags but
has no plans to offer them to car owners.</TE>
<TE>   The papers show "there is a viable recall remedy ... to put in the
vehicles to save people from being blinded," said Clarence Ditlow,
head of the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington consumer
organization.</TE>
<TE>   The group obtained the documents from the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration after filing a public records lawsuit against
the agency. "There's a fix, and it's being withheld," Ditlow said.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA officials declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The air bags in question were installed only in Altimas produced
in 1994 and early '95. Company officials say that customer relations
-- rather than safety -- prompted them to begin work in late 2000 on
a possible air bag substitute.</TE>
<TE>   According to a memo filed with NHTSA, Nissan began the work after
being approached by a news organization for what the company assumed
would be "a sensationalized television show about the air bag."</TE>
<TE>   Nissan representatives were "informed that the theory of the story
would be that the ... Altima air bag was too 'aggressive' or too
'powerful.' ... Consideration was given to possible consumer
dissatisfaction with the early Altima air bag in the event of a
sensationalized television broadcast critical of the ... Altima air
bag's energy level," the memo to NHTSA said.</TE>
<TE>   Although not mentioned by name in the memo, "Dateline NBC"
contacted Nissan in late 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Dateline" eventually aired a report on the air bags last July.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, according to the memo, Nissan immediately sought
help from air bag maker Takata to design a substitute.</TE>
<TE>   A chronology contained in the memo shows that Nissan approved a
final design in April 2001, and weeks later received sample air bags
for testing.</TE>
<TE>   At least 30 people have sued Nissan, claiming severe eye injuries
from the air bags.</TE>
<TE>   But the company says the bags have been unfairly attacked because
of plaintiffs' lawyers fanning erroneous news reports.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a quality air bag.... There is no safety defect," said
Kyle Bazemore, a spokesman for Nissan North America.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan decided to design a substitute "when we were confronted
with the sensationalistic and erroneous information by the
plaintiffs' attorneys," Bazemore said. "We requested to develop a
de-powered air bag simply as a proactive measure in case it was
needed for customer satisfaction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Baron, a Portland, Ore., lawyer who has sued Nissan on
behalf of more than a dozen people, said the company's explanation is
"kind of bizarre."</TE>
<TE>   "This is an admission, in my mind, that they knew in November of
2000" that the air bag was defective, Baron said. "It's inexcusable
that they would continue to let the air bag blind people when they
have a fix."</TE>
<TE>   The Nissan memo, dated Aug. 9, 2002, was one of a number of
documents NHTSA provided this week to the Center for Auto Safety,
which gave a copy to The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the center sued NHTSA under the Freedom of Information
Act, claiming the agency had illegally withheld records pertaining to
a meeting held June 28 between Nissan and NHTSA officials.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan was represented at the meeting by Erika Z. Jones, a private
attorney who had served as NHTSA's chief counsel from 1985 to '89.</TE>
<TE>   Work on the possible replacement air bag was among topics
discussed at the meeting. After the agency sought additional details,
Nissan provided a chronology of the work in the Aug. 9 memo.</TE>
<TE>   The chronology raises questions about information provided by a
Takata affiliate in an earlier phase of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA records show that in a letter to Takata on Oct. 17, 2001,
the agency requested records of "any study, survey or investigation
pertaining to the alleged defect" in the air bags.</TE>
<TE>   The Takata affiliate, TK Holdings Inc., responded Jan. 15 that it
had "not conducted any study, survey or investigation pertaining to
the alleged defect." However, the Nissan chronology indicates that
development work on a substitute air bag was far along by then.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question ... they [Takata] should have" disclosed the
work on the substitute air bag, Ditlow said.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA officials declined to discuss Takata's letter. Officials and
a lawyer for the firm did not return phone calls.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Bidder Singles Out Diller for His Dual Role</HD>
<DH>Davis representatives contend that Universal entertainment
group deserves a full-time CEO.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can a single executive run two multibillion-dollar media companies at
the same time?</LD>
<LD>   That is the question being raised by oil tycoon Marvin Davis as he
tries to curry favor for his unsolicited $13-billion bid for Vivendi
Universal's U.S. entertainment group.</LD>
<LD>   As part of their sales pitch, Davis representatives contend that
the entertainment group, which includes Universal studios, cable
channels, the world's largest recording company and theme parks,
deserves a full-time chief executive.</LD>
<TE>   It's a not-so-subtle way of calling attention to the fact that
Barry Diller, its current co-CEO, has another job.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is corporate management isn't focused on running the
entertainment divisions, and that's what Marvin could bring to the
equation," said a source close to Davis. "It's also one reason the
entertainment assets don't command the value they should for
Vivendi."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his role at Vivendi, Diller is chief executive of
USA Interactive, a fast-growing electronic retailing concern that
owns Ticketmaster, Expedia and other Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   Davis envisions installing new leadership at Universal that would
oversee the existing divisional management team, fix up the
properties and take the company public in three or four years.</TE>
<TE>   Diller would be replaced by a seasoned entertainment chief
executive, with former Universal Pictures co-Chairman Brian Mulligan
-- the architect of Davis' deal -- playing a top management role as
chief financial or chief operating officer, according to the Davis
representative.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry is impressive, but by his own admission, Vivendi is his No.
2 priority," said the source.</TE>
<TE>   Diller would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, USA Interactive investors have tolerated Diller's
dual role over the last four months because of the media mogul's
solid financial track record and his assurances that the
entertainment duties are a part-time, and temporary, affair.</TE>
<TE>   Just this week, Diller said at a travel convention that his role
with Vivendi will end within the next four to eight months.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, there continues to be widespread speculation that if
Vivendi spins off its U.S. entertainment group, Diller would be left
in charge.</TE>
<TE>   Diller and Vivendi's new chief executive, Jean-Rene Fourtou, have
been working on a plan under which the entertainment group could
shoulder some of its Paris-based parent's staggering $19 billion in
debt, possibly as part of a public offering next year.</TE>
<TE>   Worried about the prospect that Diller might get sucked deeper
into Universal, investors in USA Interactive drove the company's
shares down nearly 5% Friday after a one-month run-up of 83%. They
closed on Nasdaq at $28.34, down $1.33.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the decline could stem from concerns that Diller
might be forced to use USAI stock as a currency to make a counterbid
for the Vivendi entertainment assets he now manages.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some large USAI shareholders said Friday that their support
of Diller had not wavered. They dismissed Davis' bid for Universal as
unfinanced and therefore not serious.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a pipe dream," said one Wall Street source who requested
anonymity. "Davis doesn't stand a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Diller is compelled to try to run both empires at once,
some say he's equipped to pull it off.</TE>
<TE>   "He's capable of doing anything he sets out to do," said Sumner
Redstone, the chairman and chief executive of Viacom Inc., and a
close friend of Davis who beat Diller in a bitter bidding war for
Paramount Communications in the mid-1990s. "He wouldn't look at
anything as a part-time job."</TE>

<TE>   Bidding but Not Always Buying</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire Marvin Davis' unsolicited $13-billion bid for Vivendi
Universal's U.S. entertainment assets has been greeted with
skepticism by some who wonder whether the notorious corporate "tire
kicker" is serious. A look at some of the oilman's business deals --
including some that fell through:</TE>
<TE>   Deal Makers</TE>
<TE>   1981: Sells 20th Century Fox four years after taking over and nets
a $350-million profit.</TE>
<TE>   1987: Sells Beverly Hills Hotel for a $65-million profit.</TE>
<TE>   2000: Nets an $80-million profit on the sale of Fox Plaza, a
Century City skyscraper.</TE>
<TE>   Deal Breakers</TE>
<TE>   1977: Tries to buy major league baseball's Oakland A's, but the
deal is blocked when the Oakland Coliseum sues.</TE>
<TE>   1986-87: Bids to buy CBS for $3.75 billion and Resorts
International for $200 million -- offers both rejected as being too
low.</TE>
<TE>   1988: A bid for the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys
fails as negotiations falter.</TE>
<TE>   1989-92: Proposes to buy Northwest, United and Continental
airlines but is either outbid or rebuffed in the unrelated offers.</TE>
<TE>   1999: Withdraws a bid to put an NFL team in Hollywood Park.
Insiders said he found the deal too costly.</TE>

<HD>Songwriters Settle Suit Over Eagles Royalties</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three songwriters who helped compose some of the Eagles' most popular
tunes accepted a settlement Friday to resolve allegations that their
music publisher shortchanged them out of millions of dollars in
royalties.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson Browne, J.D. Souther and Jack Tempchin had alleged that
Warner-Chappell Music, the publishing arm of AOL Time Warner Inc.,
had underpaid them for co-writing such hits as "Peaceful, Easy
Feeling" and "Take It Easy."</LD>
<LD>   Terms of the settlement could not be determined late Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The writers had sought punitive damages from Warner-Chappell,
which acquired their original publishing companies in 1972, then
allegedly cut a "sweetheart deal" with a Warner-affiliated record
label to license songs for an Eagles greatest-hits package, which
went on to become certified as the best-selling album in music
history.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the suit said, Warner secretly agreed with the
Eagles' manager to pay higher royalties to band members Don Henley
and Glenn Frey than to the songwriters with whom they collaborated.</TE>
<TE>   The discrepancy was not discovered until Tempchin commissioned an
audit of his royalties during the late 1990s, according to a lawyer
for the songwriters.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles' band members and manager were not named as defendants
in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Warner underpaid the writers by more than $10 million, the
suit said.</TE>
<TE>   The songwriters alleged that each time an album including their
songs was manufactured and distributed, they were paid 2 cents, the
government-mandated rate as of 1975.</TE>
<TE>   But the writers said they were never told that Warner-Chappell had
agreed to pay a higher rate -- 2.4 cents per use -- under the
licensing deal it reached with Warner's Elektra/Asylum/Nonesuch label
division.</TE>
<TE>   The songwriters earned royalties on four of the 10 tracks on the
hits album. It has sold an estimated 27 million copies, according to
the Recording Industry Assn. of America, ranking it as the top seller
in pop history.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Warner-Chappell could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>EDS Shares Rise 7.8% on Rumors of a Sale to IBM</HD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Electronic Data Systems Corp. shares rose 7.8% on speculation that
the world's second-largest seller of computer services might be
bought by larger rival IBM Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Electronic Data gained $1.21 to $16.70 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Friday; it traded as high as $17.35. The stock had
declined 77% this year and hit a 16-year low Sept. 24.</LD>
<LD>   There is a "low probability" of IBM acquiring Electronic Data,
said John B. Jones, an analyst with SoundView Technology Group Inc.
who rates IBM "outperform" and says he doesn't own the shares. "The
cultures are very different."</LD>
<TE>   IBM is busy integrating last month's $3.5-billion purchase of
PricewaterhouseCoopers' business-consulting unit, Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation that rivals will merge occurs when one company's value
falls sharply, said Jeffries &amp; Co. analyst Joseph Vafi, who rates
Electronic Data shares "hold" and said he doesn't own them. The
company's stock fell this year after it reported slowing profit, cash
flow and sales. Vafi said he disagrees with the speculation about
Electronic Data.</TE>
<TE>   "The key point isn't the rumor but that people are wanting to find
a reason to take the stock higher," Vafi said. "Electronic Data's
board would never dream of an acquisition at these levels."</TE>
<TE>   Electronic Data "is not for sale," said Sean Healy, a spokesman
for the Plano, Texas-based company. IBM spokeswoman Carol Makovich
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM fell 47 cents to $84.43 on the
NYSE. They have fallen 30% this year.</TE>

<HD>FERC Says Enron Unit Conducted Bogus Power Orders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. used its Portland General Electric utility in Oregon to
make bogus orders for power in California that helped run up costs
for consumers and violated market rules, lawyers for a federal agency
allege.</LD>
<LD>   Enron and Portland General traders misled the operator of
California's electricity market and rival companies into believing
that power lines would be overloaded so Enron would be paid for
relieving the congestion, according to a staff report filed Nov. 14
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Portland General referred to the report in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The report was filed in a case before a FERC administrative law
judge, who is pursuing alleged corporate misconduct uncovered in the
agency's continuing investigation of Western power markets.</TE>
<TE>   It cites transactions in April and June 2000, before power prices
in California surged tenfold and the state's largest utilities went
billions of dollars into debt buying power. The commission has been
investigating allegations of market manipulation by Enron since the
Houston-based energy trader disclosed some of its methods.</TE>
<TE>   The report adds detail to allegations made in August that Enron
used Spokane, Wash.-based Avista Corp. as a middleman to legitimize
otherwise forbidden trades.</TE>
<TE>   "Traders described the trades as 'goofy' and 'screwy,' while
transmission schedulers used terms such as 'bogus' and 'bizarre,' "
the FERC report said, citing telephone transcripts.</TE>
<TE>   "These transactions were proper," Avista spokesman Hugh Imhof
said. "Nothing prohibited Enron and Portland General from trading
with one another."</TE>

<HD>Farmer Bros. Must Allow Vote, SEC Says</HD>
<DH>Shareholder proposal would require greater disclosure of
the coffee firm's investments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission has turned up the heat on
coffee roaster Farmer Bros. Co., possibly clearing the way for
shareholders to learn more about the company's financial strategies
and how its huge pot of assets is being invested.</LD>
<LD>   Torrance-based Farmer Bros. was ordered by the SEC to let
shareholders vote on a measure that would force the company to
provide more detailed financial information. Farmer Bros. is sitting
on $295 million in cash and investments -- an amount equivalent to
about half of its total stock market value. To the chagrin of some
shareholders, most of the money is invested in low-yielding U.S.
government securities.</LD>
<LD>   Franklin Mutual Advisors, which owns 9.6% of Farmer Bros. stock,
submitted a proposal in June that if passed would require the coffee
business to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940. Among
other things, the act stiffens the responsibilities of independent
directors and mandates greater disclosure about a firm's investments
and their performance.</LD>
<TE>   Generally, a firm with 40% or more of its assets in investment
securities and cash must adhere to the stricter disclosure rules.
Farmer's stockpile of cash and securities represents about 70% of its
corporate assets.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the proposal passes could turn on the dynamics of the
extended family of Roy F. Farmer, the 86-year-old chairman and chief
executive, who has closely guarded control of the company for 50
years.</TE>
<TE>   The son of the founder, Farmer owns about 10% of the company. But
through a set of family trusts, he holds the voting rights to more
than 40% of the company's shares. It is not clear whether family
members who side with Franklin Mutual can persuade Farmer to vote
their shares according to their wishes.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer has been at odds over board representation and other
matters with his 85-year-old sister, Catherine Crowe, and her
children. The Crowe family owns nearly one-quarter of Farmer Bros.
shares.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Bros. delayed its annual shareholders meeting while its
attorneys fought to keep the Franklin Mutual proposal off the ballot.
The company argued to the SEC that the proposal was too vague and
would cause Farmer Bros. to violate several securities laws because
the firm was not structured to be in compliance with the Investment
Company Act.</TE>
<TE>   But in a Nov. 15 letter to Farmer Bros., the commission said, "We
are unable to concur with your view that Farmer Bros. may exclude the
proposal."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is good that the SEC enforces the right to put this
proposal on the company's proxy statement, but it is unfortunate that
management of the company needs to be told that the SEC will enforce
shareholder rights," said Gary Lutin, an investment banker and
corporate governance activist working with Franklin Mutual.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Bros. has not announced a new date for the annual meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer and his son Roy E. Farmer, the company's president, did not
return calls.</TE>
<TE>   Last month the SEC ruled in favor of a different Farmer Bros.
effort to block a shareholders proposal. Mitchell Partners, a Costa
Mesa money manager, had sought a vote to require that the company's
board have a majority of independent directors. Though it won that
battle, Farmer Bros. eventually will have to accede to a similar
requirement based on recent corporate reform legislation and Nasdaq
listing requirements.</TE>
<TE>   A group of shareholders that includes Franklin Mutual is alarmed
by the investment by Farmer Bros. of $234 million in Treasury
securities, which Lutin estimates posted a 1.73% return during the
last quarter. Lutin said the rest of the portfolio had a 7% return,
close to the 8% the company has said it expects to earn for its
pension assets.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Farmer Bros. directors Thursday, Lutin wrote that
"while there may be some unrevealed business reason for this new
investment policy," shareholders feared that the investment in the
government securities was a ploy to avoid running afoul of ratios
that determine whether a company must comply with the Investment
Company Act. The ratio test for compliance with the act excludes
government securities.</TE>
<TE>   "In any event, the difference between returns of 8% and 2% on $234
million, without further accumulations, would cost shareholders $14
million annually," Lutin wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Lutin urged the board of Farmer Bros. to take the following
actions to improve its communication with shareholders:</TE>
<TE>   * Nominate a majority of independent directors for election at
this year's annual meeting rather than wait until next year to comply
with new laws and Nasdaq listing requirements.</TE>
<TE>   * Establish a separate entity to manage the company's investment
funds in compliance with the Investment Company Act, allowing the
coffee processing and distribution operations to be managed
independently of the investment fund structure.</TE>
<TE>   * Commit to retaining professionally qualified advisors to examine
corporate restructuring and strategic alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Although Farmer Bros. is a public company, fewer than 1,000 of its
nearly 2 million shares outstanding change hands daily, on average.
Its shares did not trade Friday but rose $2.35 on Thursday to close
at $310 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>2 Liquid Audio Execs Resign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six years after founding online music distributor Liquid Audio Inc.,
two top executives at the troubled Redwood City, Calif., firm have
resigned their posts, the company disclosed Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Gerald Kearby, chief executive and president, and Robert Flynn,
senior vice president of business development, stepped down earlier
in the week for undisclosed reasons. Neither could be reached for
comment.</LD>
<LD>   Flynn will remain on Liquid's board, and the company retained both
men as consultants.</LD>
<TE>   The resignations came as the board of directors tries to develop a
new strategy for Liquid, which recently canceled its planned merger
with Alliance Entertainment Corp., a top independent distributor of
prerecorded CDs, DVDs and tapes.</TE>
<TE>   In anticipation of the merger, Liquid in September sold the rights
to its patented technology for secure music distribution to Microsoft
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The company has seen its revenue plummet since mid-2000, and
dissident shareholders have tried to force it to liquidate while it
still has an ample supply of cash.</TE>
<TE>   Those shareholders, whose opposition helped kill the Alliance
deal, ousted Kearby from the board at the annual meeting in
September.</TE>
<TE>   But Liquid's fortunes recently have begun to turn. The company
just started offering online retailers more than 43,000 downloadable
songs from the world's largest record label, Vivendi Universal
subsidiary Universal Music Group.</TE>
<TE>   The deal was by far the largest commitment by a major record label
to Liquid's online distribution business. A similar agreement with
EMI Recorded Music is set to take effect next month.</TE>
<TE>   Liquid named Raymond Doig, a former executive at 20th Century Fox
who also lost his seat on the Liquid board in September, as its new
chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen V. Imbler, a management consultant and Liquid board
member, was named president, and James D. Somes, an investment banker
and board member, was named chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Liquid shares rose 7 cents Friday to close at $2.65 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Dow Notches 7th Gaining Week</HD>
<DH>Profit-taking dampens a two-day rally, and the broader
indexes finish mixed, though winners still lead losers on the NYSE
and Nasdaq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue-chip stocks notched their seventh straight week of gains Friday
-- the longest streak in more than four years -- though some
investors couldn't resist cashing in recent profits late in the day.</LD>
<LD>   A pullback was somewhat expected after a two-day surge pushed
stocks to their highest level in months, analysts said. Lighter
trading in advance of the Thanksgiving holiday also contributed to a
choppy session.</LD>
<LD>   "We're having a bit of pause after [Thursday's] big rally," said
Ed Peters, investment officer at PanAgora Asset Management. "With the
advance being so quick, people are reassessing."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow industrials fell 40.31 points, or 0.5%, to close at
8,804.84, after a two-day gain of 370 points. Thursday, the blue-chip
index closed at its highest level since Aug. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Broader market indexes finished mixed Friday, although the overall
market was positive, with winners leading losers by slim margins on
the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index inched up 1.19 points, or 0.1%, to
1,468.74, the highest since June 19. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
declined 3.21 points, or 0.3%, to 930.55.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow gained 2.6% to post its seventh winning week
in a row, a feat not seen since the period ended March 20, 1998. The
Nasdaq climbed 4.1% and the S&amp;P 500 rose 2.3%, their sixth week of
gains in seven weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have been cheered in recent days by some upbeat economic
reports. Just as important, some analysts say, is that institutional
investors know that the stock market is traditionally strong in
December -- which is making them afraid of missing out on a
continuing rally.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a real performance anxiety out there right now for people
to get invested," said Philip S. Dow, managing director of equity
strategy at Dain Rauscher Wessels.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts caution that the market remains vulnerable to
trigger-finger profit-taking as well as concerns about terrorism and
a possible war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The tech sector, which rallied sharply on Wednesday and Thursday,
was held back Friday after computer networking firm Brocade
Communications Systems cut its revenue outlook, slashed jobs and said
its chief operating officer will leave.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the news from battered tech companies has been improving
lately. Hewlett-Packard surged 12.7% on Thursday after the company
reported a surprisingly strong quarterly profit.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares added 16 cents to $19.15 on Friday. Elsewhere in tech,
Oracle gained 12 cents to $11.58 and Palm rose 57 cents to $16.72.</TE>
<TE>   Optimism that the economy will continue to improve has caused more
investors to flee Treasury bonds in recent weeks, in favor of stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The five-year Treasury note yield climbed Friday to its highest
level since August, rising to 3.24% from Thursday's 3.21%.</TE>
<TE>   "We are entering a bear market for Treasuries," John Roberts, head
of government bond trading at Barclays Capital Inc., told Bloomberg
News. "Moves into corporate bonds and stocks are accelerating."</TE>
<TE>   Among Friday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Brocade fell $2, or 27%, to $5.28, on its warning. Shares of
other data storage-related companies also slid. QLogic was off $1.24
to $43.26 and Emulex eased 74 cents to $24.67.</TE>
<TE>   * Salomon Smith Barney cut its ratings on software companies
Siebel Systems and PeopleSoft, saying software-related firms probably
will give bleak forecasts in coming months. Still, Siebel shares
closed up 8 cents at $8.75. PeopleSoft shares dropped $1.04 to
$19.99.</TE>
<TE>   * ConocoPhillips dropped $1.39 to $48.55. The third-largest U.S.
oil company said it would produce less oil and natural gas next year
and has targeted asset sales of as much as $4 billion as it seeks to
trim debt and improve returns. Exxon Mobil, the biggest publicly
traded oil company, fell 64 cents to $34.22.</TE>
<TE>   * Cosi, a New York-based restaurant chain known for its
sandwiches, rose 60 cents, or 8.6%, to $7.60, on its first day of
public trading.</TE>

<HD>Napster Likely to Be Sold to Roxio</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The song-swapping technology, brand and Web site of Napster Inc.
probably will be sold to Roxio Inc. on Wednesday, now that a
potential rival bidder has missed Friday's deadline to top Roxio's
offer of $5 million and stock warrants.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified second bidder had told the trustee handling
Napster's bankruptcy filing that it planned to bid but called just
before the afternoon deadline to say it needed more time.</LD>
<LD>   "I said, 'Time is up, for good or ill,' " trustee Hobart Truesdell
said. "We did not receive the bid that was indicated to me was
forthcoming."</LD>
<TE>   Truesdell said he expected final objections to the sale to be
filed Monday by former Napster Chairman John Fanning, Napster
creditor PlayMedia Systems Inc. and perhaps Friday's unidentified
near-bidder.</TE>
<TE>   The objections will be considered at a hearing on the sale in
Delaware Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "If they are overcome, then a closing will occur right after the
hearing ends," Truesdell said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara, Calif.-based Roxio has not detailed its plans for
Napster's assets but has pledged that whatever it does would honor
music copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   Napster filed for bankruptcy protection while it was losing a
record industry lawsuit that claimed that Napster's peer- to-peer
file-swapping system helped millions of computer users steal
copyrighted songs.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Napster was testing a second-generation system that
allowed for payments and restrictions on the use of song files.</TE>
<TE>   Roxio sells programs that allow users to record encrypted songs,
unencrypted MP3s and other types of files on CDs. Its software is
installed on 100 million personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   Investment banker Rick Chance, who spent weeks explaining
Napster's assets to Roxio and other interested parties, said he
doubted that the judge would put off the sale's closing.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate proceeding, Napster's machines, memorabilia and
other hard assets will be auctioned Dec. 11. Even after the sales,
Napster's bankruptcy case will continue into next year.</TE>

<HD>Northrop May Sign Consent Decree</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to speed up regulatory approval of its proposed $7.8-billion
purchase of TRW Inc., Northrop Grumman Corp. has been talking to the
Justice Department about signing a consent decree that would satisfy
a key anti-competitive concern with the merger, a source close to the
talks said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Top Pentagon officials tentatively have signed off on the deal,
but the Justice Department has expressed concerns that the merger
could hurt competition in the lucrative military satellite business,
mainly based on complaints raised by Lockheed Martin Corp. earlier
this year.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike Boeing Co. and TRW, which make spacecraft and components,
Lockheed relies heavily on suppliers for communications and sensor
systems that go into its satellites. Among the suppliers Lockheed
buys from are TRW and Northrop.</LD>
<TE>   Lockheed has argued that if the Northrop-TRW deal were approved,
the company would become both a prime contractor and a supplier and
thus could be reluctant to pass along key technology to its
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   To address this concern, Northrop has been seeking a less formal
agreement with both the Pentagon and Justice Department in which it
would promise to give competitors equal access to its technology.</TE>
<TE>   But, according to industry sources, the Justice Department has
been seeking a more formal agreement that would give the agency power
to take enforcement action if Northrop were to block such access.</TE>
<TE>   With a self-imposed deadline to complete the TRW merger by year's
end, Northrop management is considering signing the decree, a
Northrop source said.</TE>
<TE>   A Northrop spokesman declined to comment but said discussions with
the Justice Department were continuing.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Northrop said in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing Friday that with the TRW acquisition it expected to spend
about $720 million for capital expenses in 2003, up 33% from $540
million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop also disclosed that it expected cash from operations next
year to be about $1 billion, with cash from operations rising to $1.5
billion in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Northrop said it added two directors to its board:
Charles H. Noski, retired vice chairman of AT&amp;T Corp., and retired
Adm. Charles R. Larson. Noski, 50, recently retired from the AT&amp;T
board, and Larson rejoins the Northrop board after a brief absence to
run for lieutenant governor of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Century City-based Northrop's stock rose $1.12 to $97.12 Friday on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>SEC Files Lawsuit Against Former Peregrine Manager</HD>
<DH>Ex-treasury manager is accused of insider trading,
involvement in improper accounting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Poirier</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal regulators said Friday that they filed suit against a former
senior treasury manager at Peregrine Systems Inc. over her alleged
role in the company's improper recording of revenue.</LD>
<LD>   In a civil lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Ilse Cappel, who worked at the San Diego-based software
firm from 1993 to June 2002, also was accused of illegal insider
trading.</LD>
<LD>   Larry West, an SEC enforcement attorney, said the civil complaint
is the first such action involving its ongoing investigation of
accounting practices at Peregrine, which filed for bankruptcy
protection in September.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC accused Cappel of acting with other executives, including
the company's chief financial officer, in a scheme to hide the
company's difficulties in collecting its accounts receivable.</TE>
<TE>   "Those difficulties arose because Peregrine recorded revenue on
contingent sales and other non-binding arrangements it entered into
with customers," the SEC said in the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said Cappel's part was only "one portion of the
wide-ranging fraud" by the company, which had said earlier this year
that it had incorrectly booked as much as $100 million in revenue
over nearly three years.</TE>
<TE>   Cappel's attorney, Michael Lipman, said he anticipates a
resolution of the SEC matter.</TE>
<TE>   "While working at Peregrine, my client made some mistakes and bad
judgment calls," Lipman said. "She has been candid in discussing
these events with the government and will continue to do so," Lipman
said.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it also is under investigation by the Department
of Justice for its accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Cappel sold more than 16,000 shares of Peregrine stock from March
1999 to January 2002 for proceeds of $334,287, while she allegedly
had nonpublic information about the accounting irregularities and the
company's true financial condition, the SEC alleges.</TE>

<LD>Broadcom Corp. of Irvine fired more than 500 workers, or 16% of its
staff, and consolidated units to reduce costs amid slumping sales of
some lines of chips, Chief Executive Henry Nicholas said.</LD>
<LD>   Nicholas declined to say precisely how many jobs were cut.
Broadcom consolidated groups that develop chips for big
telecommunications networks and that make chips for office networks
because of slow growth in the former business, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Broadcom shares gained 15 cents to $20.79 in extended trading. The
stock had risen 69 cents to $20.64 in regular trading on Nasdaq.</LD>

<LD>Moody's Investors Service cut Williams Cos.' credit rating on about
$13 billion in debt to six levels below investment grade because of
concern the energy company will have difficulty generating cash to
meet its obligations.</LD>
<LD>   Poor energy market conditions will limit revenue at the
second-biggest U.S. owner of natural-gas pipelines, and the company
will have difficulty reaching its goals for cash flow and capital
spending next year, Moody's said.</LD>

<LD>General Electric Co., which has been eliminating businesses with low

much as $150 million by the end of the year, said people familiar
with the matter.</LD>
<LD>   The unit makes loans to small businesses and includes assets of
Heller Financial Inc., which GE bought for $5.3 billion in 2001. The
loans being sold are partly guaranteed by the federal Small Business
Administration and have a face value of $3 billion, the people said.</LD>
<LD>   GE, which began an auction for the small-business lending unit
this month, has been selling assets as part of Chief Executive
Jeffrey Immelt's effort to bolster GE Capital, the financing unit
that provides 45% of the company's profit.</LD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PG&amp;E Corp.'s lawsuit against state regulators to recover $9.2 billion
spent buying power during the California energy crisis was put on
hold by a federal appeals court.</LD>
<LD>   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco stayed
PG&amp;E's lawsuit, which had been scheduled for trial next year, until
it can rule on the California Public Utilities Commission's claims
that the suit is unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   California's largest utility sued to force state regulators to
raise rates so the company could recover money it spent buying power
in 2000 and 2001 at prices higher than the rates it could charge
under the state's deregulation law. A federal judge earlier this year
denied a request by the PUC to dismiss the suit, leading to the
agency's appeal.</LD>
<TE>   "The 9th Circuit will consider the serious constitutional and
federal law defenses to this lawsuit before it moves into expensive
discovery and toward trial," said Gary Cohen, the PUC's general
counsel, in a statement.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>ZURICH, Switzerland</DL>
<LD>Swiss financier Martin Ebner, whose business collapsed this year as
stock markets tumbled, was charged Friday with insider trading in
connection with the restructuring of Italian tire producer Pirelli.</LD>
<LD>   Swiss prosecutor Marc Jean-Richard said the local district court
had ruled Wednesday that the case could proceed to court.</LD>
<LD>   The prosecutor said the charges dated to 1998 when Ebner allegedly
received insider information from the Pirelli management about the
company's planned restructuring and share buyback.</LD>
<TE>   Ebner said the charges were unfounded. "I am bewildered and I
don't understand the indictment," he said in statement. He said he
was convinced the evidence would show he followed the law.</TE>
<TE>   Ebner became one of Switzerland's wealthiest men by buying large
stakes in well-established companies and then forcing through
management overhauls. But Ebner is now trying to save the remnants of
his empire.</TE>
<TE>   Ebner has seen the value of his holdings in Credit Suisse Group,
ABB and Pirelli tumble as markets fell during the last 2 1/2 years.
He has stepped down from the boards of four firms this year as his
holdings declined in value.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Texas-based homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc. sold $215 million of notes
Friday, tapping a rise in demand for riskier debt with higher yields
that made this the busiest week for corporate bond sales since March.</LD>
<LD>   The offering has ratings below investment grade and is one of
about nine other so-called junk bond issues, totaling $2.1 billion,
that have been completed this week.</LD>
<LD>   El Paso Energy Partners, the republics of Turkey and Pan- ama and
AmeriGas Partners also sold below-investment-grade bonds Friday.
Pending sales include a $750-million junk bond offering from R.H.
Donnelley Corp. to help pay for its purchase of Sprint Corp.'s
telephone book unit.</LD>
<TE>   Borrowers are taking advantage of stronger demand from investors
willing to take on the risk of holding lower-rated debt in exchange
for their higher yields. The demand is underpinned by renewed
optimism about the economy, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Folks who have had trillions of dollars sitting in money market
accounts and earning almost zero on them are looking for yield," said
Samuel Fuller, chief financial officer of D.R. Horton.</TE>
<TE>   Robust demand for junk securities has driven the yield on the KDP
Investment Advisors index of 100 junk bonds to 10.53% now, the lowest
since early June and down from a peak of 12.34% in mid-October.</TE>
<TE>   Investors sent $427 million into high-yield bond mutual funds this
week, making for six consecutive weeks of inflows totaling more than
$3.5 billion, Bear Stearns Cos. said in a report, citing AMG Data
Services.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc. must rethink the organization of some of its
businesses as it deals with federal investigations of alleged stock
research abuses at the nation's largest financial services company,
the head of its international unit said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "We fully recognize the need to rethink the basic structure of
some of our companies ... and a drive to establish the highest
ethical business practices in the industry, which is beyond what the
law requires," Sir Deryck Maughan, Citigroup vice chairman and head
of international operations, told a business executive conference in
New York.</LD>
<LD>   Maughan was filling in for Citigroup CEO Sanford I. Weill, who
pulled out of a scheduled speech at the conference.</LD>
<TE>   Citigroup is in talks with federal and state regulators to resolve
allegations that its Salomon Smith Barney securities unit issued
overly upbeat research to win lucrative investment banking deals by
advising companies on new stock issues.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon Smith Barney and other firms also have been charged with
IPO "spinning" -- or bribing executives with shares of hot stock
offerings during the late-1990s technology boom in exchange for
banking business.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup last month tried to quell criticism of ties between
investment bankers and stock analysts by creating a new unit
separating banking from its research and brokerage operations. It
brought in Sallie Krawcheck, the head of independent research firm
Sanford C. Bernstein, to run the new unit.</TE>

<LD>Kennedy car -- A brief that ran in Section A on Nov. 17 incorrectly
stated that the Lincoln Continental that President Kennedy was riding
in when he was assassinated in Dallas in 1963 had been sold at an
auction. The limousine is in the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich.
The car sold at the auction was one Kennedy had ridden in earlier in
the day.</LD>

<AU>James A. Fleming</AU>
<BD>James A. Fleming is superintendent of the Capistrano
Unified School District.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The reports about a dramatic increase in childhood autism may baffle
scientists scrambling to identify causes, but they are not surprising
to school districts. As president of the California City Schools
Superintendents Assn., I know that my colleagues are following the
issue with apprehension.</LD>
<LD>   My 50,000-student district in southern Orange County has gone from
having 18 autistic students in 1995 to 223 in 2001, an increase of
more than 1,100% in less than six years. The strain on our staff and
our budget has been enormous as teachers and administrators balance
their struggle to give these students the best possible chance for a
productive future with the reality that special education funding is
woefully inadequate. These children must be served now. The search
for a cause and for potential cures cannot allay the urgency of our
mission.</LD>
<TE>   The annual cost of the necessary services for one autistic child
runs as much as $33,760 in our district; overall, this class of
disability is the most costly one for schools to serve well. We
provide an assessment center for infants and their families. We have
trained a cadre of specialists to apply the intensive behavior
intervention that experience shows will work with autistic students.
Our teachers have incorporated specialized techniques in their
classrooms, such as one-on-one lessons that are broken down into
small, highly structured steps. One example is a series of lessons
teaching younger children what a color is. We have expanded the
number of speech pathologists and occupational therapists.</TE>
<TE>   My district undertakes all of these services not simply because of
federal requirements for comprehensive special education for those
children who need it but because we are, first and foremost,
educators who wish to serve every child in our system.</TE>
<TE>   It touches every educator when a parent writes to say "our hearts
are full and appreciative, because we know the program is expensive,
and you have reached out and made our boy a happy one who is fully
included in school, who has a good relationship with schoolmates, and
even a best friend in the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   But we cannot continue to shoulder the dramatically increased
costs to cover special education for autistic and other special-needs
children without additional help from Congress -- help that was
promised more than a quarter of a century ago when the Individuals
With Disabilities Act was passed. The act promised that school
districts would be reimbursed for 40% of expenses beyond those
normally incurred for other children. This year, the federal
government has paid 17%.</TE>
<TE>   For my district, Capistrano Unified, about $16 million must be
taken from regular education funds this year to pay for the high
expenses of autistic and other special-needs programs, resulting in
fewer educational programs overall and -- most tragically -- further
pitting the needs of one segment of our school population against
those of another segment. The result, if no help is forthcoming, is
likely to be increased class size in all grades and, in the future,
deeper cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The new data about autism add urgency to the plea from my school
district and thousands of others that special-education funding be at
the front of the public debate about serving the education of all
children.</TE>

<LD>True, the National Geographic Society has a real stake in geography.
Also foldout maps and lush color photos of wet woodlands, wild
creatures and tribal women around campfires. But this week, the
society made a stunning point with new numbers from its geography
quiz of young people in nine industrialized nations. Turns out, those
surveyed are mostly geography dummies. The good news: Americans ages
18 to 24 are not the dumbest. The bad news: Only one other nation
scored lower (the one just south of California).</LD>
<LD>   The society hired Roper Surveys to ask 56 questions of 3,250 young
adults last summer in Sweden, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, Britain,
Canada, the United States and Mexico. Nearly 30% of these folks could
not find the Pacific Ocean. The location of India, home to 17% of the
world's population, eluded 56%.</LD>
<TE>   Americans often appear to savor how insular they can seem compared
with a multilingual world. (Eighty-nine percent of the Swedes are at
least bilingual.) And there are plenty of data to support that.
Respondents in every other land had a more accurate idea of U.S.
population than did American young people, a third of whom put the
total upward of 2 billion. Judging by movie lines perhaps. Only 56%
of the Americans could locate California and Texas; 51% found New
York but only 30% placed New Jersey. Maybe the weather. However, 34%
of the Americans did know where last season's "Survivor" show was
filmed (South Pacific). It's no shock to 100% of parents that kids
are adept at tuning out information they do not think they need, even
though they tune it out before they decide they don't need it.</TE>
<TE>   On average, the Americans got 41% of the questions correct; the
Swedes, the best, averaged 71%. A majority of Americans knew that Al
Qaeda and the Taliban were in Afghanistan but only 17% knew where
that land was, and only one in seven could place a country called
Iraq. On the results' plus side, fully 89% of U.S. respondents could
find the United States on a world map (gee, thanks); on the minus
side, 95% of the Canadians could find the U.S. (oops).</TE>
<TE>   The society appointed a task force to study improving humanity's
geography sense. Schools could stop cutting geography lessons because
they're not stressed on state tests. Parents could keep an atlas
TV-handy to pounce, in pedant mode, at the mention of any country. Of
course, one obvious solution would be for every living soul to
subscribe to National Geographic. We'd have better- informed kids,
though fewer forests to photograph.</TE>

cardboard huts southeast of downtown. The intention was good: If the
city funneled indigent funding to skid row, people might be guided
into entry-level jobs, including some in the garment trade. But most
of the people on the streets turned out to be resistant to
employment, and the vision has been dismissed by most social service
experts as a pipe dream.</LD>
<LD>   Downtown business leaders long ago reached the same conclusion. At
a press conference Monday, Central City Assn. President Carol Schatz
assailed "behavior [that] ... takes the streets away from all of us."
She said the downtown business organization would pursue tough new
laws, such as city bans on public urination and defecation, camping
on sidewalks and panhandling.</LD>
<LD>   The plan has not yet won City Council backing, but the city's new
police chief, William J. Bratton, promised to beef up patrols on skid
row. Councilwoman Jan Perry, whose district includes skid row, also
supports the measures.</LD>
<TE>   Bratton didn't waste time. Three times this week, more than 250
officers swept skid row in raids that, although mainly targeting
parole violators, also rousted people sleeping outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   Other Southern California communities are ahead of Los Angeles.
Last month, Santa Monica passed laws forbidding people from sleeping
in doorways and charities from offering free meals in city parks.
Last week Palmdale decided to issue misdemeanor citations to the
scores of people who camped without permits in the desert.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed L.A. laws may seem harsh. However, if Mayor James K.
Hahn and the City Council can couple new restrictions with programs
that honestly help the addicted, ill and destitute lead productive
lives, then Los Angeles could succeed where New York and San
Francisco -- which have spent ever-larger amounts without making a
dent in the street-dweller problem -- have failed.</TE>
<TE>   The main local source for new spending on such programs is $46
million in the city's housing trust fund, set aside by the City
Council two years ago to "increase the supply of housing ...
affordable to all income levels."</TE>
<TE>   Now the city is deciding how to spend the money. To get the
biggest result, at least one-quarter should go to helping house
families earning less than $15,000 a year -- which includes those
headed by fast food and garment workers and security guards, plus
people now living on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   That sometimes means complicated solutions. People with mental
illnesses and drug or alcohol addictions need treatment and other
help, before or concurrent with any housing benefits. And some of the
encampment dwellers, those who prey on their neighbors as thieves,
rapists and drug sellers, properly belong in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Californians a few weeks ago generously approved a $2.4-billion
statewide affordable housing bond measure "especially for people who
are poor or destitute." About one-third of it could go to Los Angeles
over several years as matching funds. But such generosity won't last
unless the results show on the street. That's why a policy of tough
love plus compassionate pragmatism is so urgent.</TE>

<HD>State Taxes: Bite the Bullet</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Elizabeth G. Hill, the Legislature's nonpartisan fiscal advisor,
puts headlines like "Huge Problem Looming" in her 2003 fiscal
outlook, California's elected officials had better perk up their
ears. Hill, a master of understatement, adds that "this year [2003]
will be much harder than the last." The 2002 struggle to paste over a
$24-billion deficit was the longest and one of the meanest in state
history. The state's budget collapse has become at least as dire as
the power crisis: Elected leaders can either agree on painful
solutions -- including taxes -- or be labeled failures in the history
books.</LD>
<LD>   The Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis face a staggering shortfall of
$21.1 billion in the next fiscal year, beginning July 1, including $6
billion left over from this fiscal year. It's impossible to bridge
that with cuts alone without devastating state services, from
children's health care to coastal protection. Even worse, Davis
declared Thursday that Hill's forecast was too optimistic, but he
didn't say by how much.</LD>
<TE>   Much of this year's shortfall of $24 billion on a total budget of
$99 billion was "covered" by the smoke and mirrors of loans and
delayed payments, part of a failed bet that the economy would
recover. Such tricks can't be used twice: Each loan or delay
contributes to coming years' projected deficits. Even when the
recession passes, spending will exceed expected revenue, Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   There is plenty of blame to go around. Republicans accused the
Democrats of wanton overspending in surplus years fueled by rising
stock markets. But appropriations, requiring a two-thirds vote,
couldn't have gotten through without GOP support.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, finally showing some grit now that the election is won,
called the Legislature into special session Dec. 9 to find $5 billion
in cuts from the current budget. Every department in state government
should expect to emerge smaller.</TE>
<TE>   As for the next fiscal year, complicated fakery won't work and new
taxes as well as deep cuts are unavoidable. The so-called car tax
should have been restored this year to its 1999 levels, and next year
will have to be. The same for temporarily reimposing higher top state
income tax brackets and extending the sales tax to goods and services
such as auto repairs, sports events and engineering and lawyer fees
that are now oddly exempted.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans keep pounding the tired line that they will oppose any
new tax. They should drop the bluster now. Davis and the leaders of
both parties in the Legislature need to dig deep for the patience and
cooperation they have lacked.</TE>

<LD>In his Nov. 19 commentary, "A Silver Spoon Is Gouging Unions," Robert
Scheer describes how Bush administration policies are undermining
America's middle class -- in spite of the fact that middle-class
consumer power has kept our sputtering economy from drifting into a
major depression. We have to look elsewhere in The Times, however, to
see what our nation will look like if the Bush administration's
assault on the middle class continues.</LD>
<LD>   In "Scavengers Are Gauge of Rising Poverty" (Nov. 19) we learn
that Argentina's "ex-waiters, ex-factory workers, ex-maids,
ex-something[s]" have joined traditional "trash scavengers" to eke
out a meager living on the streets of Buenos Aires. These former
middle-class workers, now reduced to the status of "cardboard
people," spend every day digging through the trash heaps that
Argentina's wealthy ruling class dumps on the streets. Without
middle-class consumers there is no economic recovery in sight for
Argentina. There are only more people gathering every day around the
trash heaps. Wake up, America!</LD>

<TE>   It is obvious that Scheer never worked for the federal government
or observed the operations of its unions with an unjaundiced eye. I
worked for the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration in the late
1980s. The union at HCFA viewed its role as protecting all employees
from disciplinary action, even the least productive and laziest
employees. Not surprisingly, these were the employees who were the
union's most staunch supporters. Those of us who worked hard at our
jobs didn't even belong to the union because we understood that the
union's success in protecting the 10% of employees who were
nonperformers resulted in more work for the 90% who put in an honest
day's work.</TE>
<TE>   There is a culture in a lot of federal workplaces that takes new,
enthusiastic employees aside and advises them to "slow down" so as
not to make the senior workers look bad. Maybe if federal unions
focused on protecting employees from the occasional unjust action and
worked with supervisors to rid the workforce of the unproductive we
would not have cause to privatize federal jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff McCombs</TE>
<TE>   La Palma</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scheer's column highlights the folly of the administration's push
to privatize work currently done by federal workers. It will actually
cut money out of the economy, weaken consumer spending and increase
burdens on government. Little noted is the likelihood that
privatization will cut few, if any, government expenses. Contractors
expect to profit by the difference between what working people used
to make and the lower wages they will now be paid. This will be
shared with their political confederates in the form of campaign
contributions.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scheer tells you that government workers paid from your labor are
the keys to growth of a "stable middle class" and a "stable
democracy." What he wants you to embrace as "stable" is actually a
proven model for a slow, ponderous, poor-producing economy that keeps
people from improving their lot in life. "Here, take this job and be
happy. You're part of the middle class. Forever. Have a nice day."</TE>
<TE>   The alternative is encouraging individuals to achieve and produce
through hard work, innovation and competition. Some want to scare you
into thinking the word "privatization" means great risk. On the
contrary, a marketplace full of ideas yields the best there is to
offer. A marketplace with one idea and no competition yields the
minimum.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Franz</TE>
<TE>   Brea</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Privatize" is a euphemistic term for what big-time racketeers
used to call "skimming." By forcing jobholders who perform services
in the public sector to get their jobs through third-party
entrepreneurs, we allow private contractors to skim the cream off
these employees' salary and benefit packages.</TE>
<TE>   Operating outside the Civil Service protections that disallow quid
pro quo agreements and non-meritorious candidate selection for job
slots, these privateer agencies are free to pick these people's
pockets at will. This transfer of funds from the public to the
private sector is coming right out of your and my taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Those in the Bush administration have squandered the federal
budget surplus that existed when they came into office and put us
back in debt. However much they talk about wanting to "save" money
for the taxpayer, Bush and his associates cannot honestly be called
fiscal conservatives, can they?</TE>

<HD>If You're Fat, Don't Blame McDonald's</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was shocked when I picked up "McTrouble in Fat Land" by Greg
Critser (Opinion, Nov. 17) and read the opening line, "Blame Max
Cooper." Since I'm the only Max Cooper in the McDonald's system and
the only one who created the concept of "value meals," I assumed it
was me. Little did I realize that the marketing of "table d'hote"
meals at our restaurants and simplifying ordering by allowing the
customer to say, "I'll have a Big Mac Extra Value Meal," would result
in all America becoming overweight -- or that because of my Extra
Value Meals our society would develop diabetes, high blood pressure
and every other known and still-to-be-discovered disease.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting in front of the television set and munching on potato
chips or going to a movie and buying a bucketful of buttered popcorn
or baking brownies at home have no effect on being overweight. No,
it's only McDonald's. Why not take Emeril, Julia Child and Wolfgang
Puck off TV? Isn't there any personal responsibility for what one
does to one's body?</LD>
<LD>   McDonald's in moderation is a great experience. It's tasty; it's
fun and may be the only time that families dine together. When we
featured our McLean sandwich, the public made it clear that they were
not interested, nor do they buy more of our salads than Big Macs.</LD>
<TE>   We're only a part of a weekly diet. If people are concerned about
their weight and health -- and they should be -- they should embark
on a regular exercise program. Then making McDonald's part of their
monthly pleasures is tolerable. To single out McDonald's as the
culprit for our overweight society is outrageous. Exercise, eat
wisely, but enjoy McDonald's when you have the urge.</TE>
<TE>   Max Cooper</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When I was a kid in Iowa in the early 1960s, we enjoyed eating at
McDonald's. My next-door neighbor was a butcher and supplied the
hamburger to the local McDonald's. His was a small business, and he
hand-selected the beef from farmers in the local area, selling some
to locals, shipping some to hotels in New York City and grinding some
for the McDonald's. When I and my little friends went to McDonald's
we enjoyed my neighbor's quality hamburger, along with French fries
cooked in animal fat and milkshakes made from what I believe was real
milk and ice cream. And dang, it was good!</TE>
<TE>   While the conclusive scientific judgment on the healthfulness of
such a meal is, I believe, still not in, I can tell you that, even
though we had big appetites, we felt no need to "supersize" our
consumption of such quality food, any more than one would feel it
necessary to supersize a fine French or Italian meal at a restaurant.
We ate a hamburger, a small fries and a milkshake and were satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps 21st century fats and oils and "reestablishing a group
dining culture" will become, as Critser argues, an exciting
substitute for my youthful fast-food experiences. But I will tell you
that if the food at McDonald's tasted now like it did in the early
1960s, I and my kids would again patronize McDonald's. We do not now
-- no matter how big or tiny the portions.</TE>

<LD>In May, the Bush administration announced that it was moving to end
the Government Printing Office's 141-year monopoly on federal
printing by allowing private firms to compete for $500 million worth
of federal printing and copying contracts. A number of myths have
spread about the possible implications of ending the GPO's monopoly.</LD>
<LD>   "Chokehold on Knowledge" (editorial, Nov. 8) described the effort
to introduce competition as "a threat to democracy," suggesting that
individual agencies could "sanitize" their electronic databases.
Nothing could be further from the truth. The only issue here is who
will perform the actual printing operations -- a government monopoly
or the printer that offers the best combination of quality, cost and
time of delivery. Nothing in the administration's effort to introduce
competition into government printing would affect the content of
government publications.</LD>
<LD>   The Times' assertion that the introduction of competition would
"spell the end of the current system" that requires agencies to send
their documents to "neutral librarians" is also patently false. In
fact, the Bush administration's policy expressly requires that
agencies provide government publications to the superintendent of
documents at the GPO for distribution to the depository libraries.</LD>
<TE>   The administration's approach will expand and improve the public's
access to government information. The GPO itself admits that under
today's monopoly, almost 50% of government publications don't make it
to libraries and institutions. Our plan strengthens the law and
requires federal agencies to distribute publications immediately. It
also encourages agencies to do so electronically, thus streamlining
delivery to libraries and the public. Opening federal printing to
competition could save taxpayers $50 million to $70 million annually.
At the same time, this administration will ensure that the cherished
principle of the public's right to know is strengthened wherever
possible.</TE>

<LD>I think the MTA showed questionable judgment in accepting the
advertising created for the new James Bond movie. It's disconcerting
to see municipal buses cruise by decorated with giant illustrations
of 007 and his girlfriend pointing guns. Or is this the sort of
message that the city wants to send to young people?</LD>

<LD>Re "U.S. Turns Its Back on Afghans, Again," Commentary, Nov. 18: Many
Americans thought we won the Afghanistan battle in the war on
terrorism. The truth is that our armed forces, with local help, won
only half the battle. Unless we apply the same focus and vigor to the
other half, we'll lose Afghanistan for the second time. We're on
center stage. The world is watching to see whether we are reliable.
People in Afghanistan and other Islamic countries where terrorism
finds recruits in the swamp of frustrated hopes for economic and
democratic reforms wait to see what will happen.</LD>
<LD>   Our nonmilitary reliability must measure up to the effectiveness
of our armed forces. This must be demonstrated in Afghanistan and in
the Israeli-Palestinian settlement. We can't allow Iraq to distract
us. We and our allies need to take the first step now: Reaffirm our
Afghanistan commitments -- and follow these words with significant
deeds of security extension and reconstruction. We must whistle and
walk at the same time.</LD>

Taliban and accidentally bombed thousands of civilians. It appears
that we have abandoned the promised support for rebuilding the
country and rule is going back to the warlords.</TE>

Nov. 17: Steve Lopez misses the point regarding the homosexual
servicemen who were kicked out of the Defense Language Institute.
They have knowingly deceived the U.S. government. They joined the
armed forces while knowing the rules. Are those the people we want
defending our country?</LD>
<LD>   Lopez describes how a serviceman was caught in bed with his gay
lover on military grounds at 3:30 a.m. How stupid can these guys be?

<LD>I find Jonathan Turley's Nov. 17 commentary on the Bush
administration's new Information Awareness Office very disturbing. He
points out that "with no public notice or debate, the administration
has been working on the creation of the world's largest computer
system and database, one with the ability to track every credit card
purchase, travel reservation, medical treatment and common
transaction by every citizen."</LD>
<LD>   Why has this come about without an outcry? The answer is fear. FDR
said, "We have nothing to fear but fear itself," to get our
countrymen to invest in an economy wrecked by the Depression. That
was a positive use of the idea of fear. Turley points out that "over
the last year, the public has yielded large tracts of constitutional
territory that had been jealously guarded for generations." This,
too, is a positive use of fear. The White House has been using the
fear of terrorism to take from us the freedoms that generations of
American soldiers have fought and died for.</LD>
<LD>   Are we not better off that some of us die from acts of terrorism
rather than lose our liberties? Patrick Henry evidently thought so
when he said, "Give me liberty, or give me death." So, President
Bush, put that in your computer and chew on it!</LD>

<TE>   The Total Information Awareness project is, indeed, an Orwellian
project. Conceived by disgraced former National Security Advisor John
Poindexter, it would obliterate many of our most cherished concepts
of privacy and freedom from government intrusion into our private
lives. A high-tech Big Brother for real.</TE>
<TE>   Now I must insert a new threat in my priority listing of the
forces that are the greatest threats to the way of life I have
enjoyed for 80 years: (1) Al Qaeda; (2) Total Information Awareness
project; (3) Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft; (4) Saddam Hussein; (5) Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell.</TE>

<TE>   John Balzar hopes that ordinary people will soon take control of

of power in Washington (Commentary, Nov. 17). Yet, on the same page
we read for the first time in The Times, in Turley's column, that the
Bush administration has employed Poindexter to oversee the
Information Awareness Office and serve in this administration's
latest version of Big Brother. Good old Iran-Contra hero Ollie North
may not be far behind.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Court Widens Wiretapping in Terror Cases," Nov. 19: I have
Arab neighbors living on my block, and I am friendly with them.
Suppose they were under investigation. Under this new ruling, the FBI
could come into my house and terrorize me and my family without a
search warrant just because I talked to them. Our forefathers would
roll over in their graves to see that we gave up our constitutional
rights. Are we so weak with fear that we let Ashcroft destroy
everything our forefathers fought and died for?</TE>

<TE>   Shortly after The Times published Turley's commentary on the
Information Awareness Office, Ashcroft attempted to justify another
Orwellian government power that the Bush administration is seeking
with yet another example of "doublespeak." He said that the ruling by
the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review on wiretap
guidelines "revolutionizes our ability to investigate and prosecute
terrorists." Yet he also said, "We haven't really changed the
threshold" for undertaking a search. How is it possible to
revolutionize something without really changing the threshold? Big
Brother is gaining strength.</TE>

<LD>Re "Mr. Hart's Teachable Moment," Nov. 19: While I applaud former
state Education Secretary Gary K. Hart's return to the classroom, the
article points out why there is such an acute shortage of teachers.
After getting to pick and choose his students, having the help of two
college students to read his students' essays and having immediate
access to top district officials to cut through the bureaucracy, he
has committed to staying only two years. Most teachers plug along
much longer with much less.</LD>
<LD>   Though not teaching a full load, he still puts in 80-hour weeks
and, after only three months on the job, already has eyes that are
"dark with fatigue." Additionally, he is unable to follow the
mandates his fellow politicians have placed upon teachers.</LD>
<LD>   However, Hart is making the "big bucks" -- $28,000 a year! Anyone
still wondering why there's a shortage?</LD>
<TE>   Marlin Sobbota</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article on Hart would be quite funny if it were not so sad.
To think this man helped mold California's state standards and
curriculum, the same state standards and curriculum to which
thousands of teachers are held accountable on a daily basis,
standards that rob teachers of their creativity and enthusiasm
throughout the year.</TE>
<TE>   Hart himself has shown that good teachers who are motivated and
love their jobs enjoy having control over their learning environment.
He may not be "trying to change the world" but he sure helped change
California's educational system -- a system made up of packaged,
rote, standards-based education where all teachers are held to, in
some cases, unrealistic standards of performance. It is a shame that,
as Hart has learned, good theory doesn't always translate into good
practice.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask the ninth-grade history teacher at Sacramento's Kennedy
High School doing his "little thing."</TE>

<TE>   What's the correct phrase? I busted a gut laughing? At the pitiful
attempts of former self-styled education guru Hart to pretend he is a
real teacher. As a former teacher for 36 years, I consider Hart's
pretense at teaching (four-fifths of a teaching day, handpicked
students, field trips to Yosemite) to be as hypocritical as his
self-promoting educational "reforms" were detrimental to the schools
of California.</TE>
<TE>   And shame on the Sacramento teachers organization for allowing
this charlatan to position himself for another run at some public
office.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's oh so easy, and much too convenient, to stereotype inner-city
schools like John C. Fremont High School -- as The Times has done in
"State Praises Turnaround at School" (Nov. 14) and "A Failing School
Perks Up" (editorial, Nov. 15). Simplistic reportage leaves all of us
seriously out of touch with the realities of education, especially in
a part of our city forgotten in so many other ways.</LD>
<LD>   As an English teacher for 17 years and a former longtime United
Teachers-Los Angeles representative at Fremont, I've witnessed years
of sad neglect from the powers that be. I can report on the majority
of the students with heart and determination. And of bureaucrats only
concerned with paychecks.</LD>
<LD>   I can report on creative teachers who take their jobs home every
night. And of broken promises from state audit teams. It is the
teachers who have maintained standards and high expectations for our
students. It is the teachers who have desperately called for skilled
administrators for four years.</LD>
<TE>   It is not the teachers but the state and the LAUSD that
consistently show little accountability, and much cynicism, when it
concerns overcrowded classes, mismanaged funds and deficient
administration. As we've shown, teachers support our new principal.
But to report a major change at Fremont since the arrival of LaVerne
Brunt is to not look past the dog-and-pony show, the sugarcoated
surface.</TE>
<TE>   When parents aren't marginalized (still no parent center), Fremont
will genuinely improve. When teachers' input isn't trivialized and
systematically oppressed, real change will occur. When the state and
the school district stop playing politics with our students, all will
be enriched.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont's students need so much more than tardy sweeps -- "no
child left behind" in the hallways? Top-down reform supposedly was
left behind in the last century. Talk to the teachers and the
parents. Listen to student concerns. Respect, trust and love are
real. Stereotypes are not.</TE>

administrators who are working hard for the children of our city.</TE>

<HD>Hadda Brooks, 86; Pianist Known as 'Queen of the Boogie'
and a Popular Torch Singer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hadda Brooks, who first rose to fame on the piano in the mid-1940s as
"Queen of the Boogie" and became a popular torch singer with hits
such as "That's My Desire," has died. She was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Brooks, who underwent a career renaissance a decade ago and drew
enthusiastic crowds with her repertoire of ballads and boogies, died
Thursday at White Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles. She underwent
open-heart surgery a few weeks ago, said Russ Paul, her manager.</LD>
<LD>   Brooks' first single, the hit "Swingin' The Boogie" in 1945,
launched not only her career, but also Los Angeles-based Modern
Records, which became the West Coast's premier post-war R&amp;B label.</LD>
<TE>   As a singer in the late 1940s and '50s, Brooks scored hits such as
"Trust in Me," "Don't Take Your Love From Me" and "Dream." She also
sang in several films and, in the early '50s, became the first
African American entertainer to host a television variety show, on
Channel 13 in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a beautiful woman and had a really sexy bedroom kind of
voice," said Austin Young, a filmmaker who is completing a
documentary on Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   Her last engagement was in September at Michael's Room, a club in
the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "She played three or four weekends in a row," Young said. "It was
packed every night she played, and the crowd would go wild. This was
a woman who knew how to work the crowd."</TE>
<TE>   She was born Hadda Hopgood in Boyle Heights in 1916. At age 4, she
begged her parents -- her mother was a doctor, her father a deputy
sheriff -- for piano lessons. She later studied classical music.</TE>
<TE>   In 1941, she married Earl "Shug" Morrison, who played for the
Harlem Globetrotters. But Morrison died of pneumonia within a year,
and Brooks never remarried.</TE>
<TE>   She worked as a rehearsal piano player in tap-dance coach Willie
Covan's studio, where the clients included Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire
and Eleanor Powell. Although Brooks often frequented the blues clubs
on Central Avenue, she had no show business aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   That changed in 1945, when a jukebox repairman named Jules Bihari
heard her rehearsing in a downtown music store for a children's dance
troupe.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to get a whole bunch of different rhythms from 'The
Poet and Peasant' overture," Brooks recalled in a 1993 interview with
The Times. "I got the waltz and rumba, and I was trying to get the
boogie down.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a man standing near me while I was playing, and he
asked me if I could do a boogie. I said, 'Well, I'm trying.' And he
said, 'I'll give you a week. If you can work up a boogie, I'll record
it. I have $800, and if it goes, then we're in business. If it
doesn't go, I've lost $800.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bihari, who gave Brooks her stage name, parlayed his $800
investment into Modern Records, which went on to record other artists
such as B.B. King and Etta James.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947, Brooks was appearing with the Charlie Barnet Orchestra at
the Million Dollar Theater in downtown Los Angeles when Barnet asked
what she'd do if she got an encore. When she answered "another
boogie," Barnet said, "Why don't you sing and break the monotony?"</TE>
<TE>   At the next show, Brooks sang "You Won't Let Me Go," which became
her first vocal recording. She recorded for 12 years, with Modern,
London Records and Columbia's Okeh label.</TE>
<TE>   Late in 1947, on Benny Goodman's recommendation, Brooks appeared
in a nightclub scene in the Virginia Mayo comedy "Out of the Blue."
(The title song became a top 10 hit for Brooks.) She also sang in
"The Bad and the Beautiful" and "In a Lonely Place."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks had made several appearances on a local TV show when the
producer called in 1951 and asked if she'd like to do her own weekly
show. Like most local TV programs at the time, "The Hadda Brooks
Show" was not big on production values.</TE>
<TE>   "They sat me at the grand piano and opened up the top," Brooks
said in the 1993 Times interview. "They had this great big ceramic
ashtray -- because I was smoking at the time -- and they opened the
show with a close-up on a cigarette in the ashtray, and then came in
on my face.</TE>
<TE>   "They pointed to me, and I sang maybe eight bars of 'That's My
Desire.' From that point, I was on my own. That was the whole
format."</TE>
<TE>   In the ensuing years, Brooks lived and worked in Europe, Australia
and Hawaii. Finding it increasingly difficult to compete with rock
'n' roll, she retired in 1971 and moved back to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, she came out of retirement when offered a job opening a
new club in L.A.'s landmark Perino's restaurant. Rave reviews brought
other jobs, including a four-week engagement at Michael's Pub in New
York City, which prompted a New York Times critic to call her "a
phenomenon."</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the Smithsonian-based Rhythm and Blues Foundation
presented her with its Pioneer Award at the Hollywood Palace. A year
later, Virgin Records, which had bought the old Modern Records
catalog, issued a 25-track compilation of Brooks' early recordings on
a CD titled "That's My Desire."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, she was back in the recording studio for the first time
in decades, recording "Time Was When," a CD for Pointblank/Virgin
Records. In 1999, the label released "I've Got News for You," a
50-year double-CD retrospective, which included eight new tracks.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by a sister, Kathryn Carter of Rowland Heights. A
private memorial service will be held.</TE>

<HD>Mitchell Burns, 75; Former Klansman Helped FBI in Probe of
1963 Bombing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Mitchell Burns, a former Ku Klux Klansman who helped the FBI secretly
tape conversations used to convict two Klansmen in a Birmingham,
Ala., church bombing that killed four girls in 1963, has died. He was
75.</LD>
<LD>   Burns died of a heart attack Tuesday at his home in Gardendale, a
Birmingham suburb, said his lawyer, John Waddell.</LD>
<LD>   Burns, a onetime meatpacker and truck driver, was in the Klan at
the time of the Sept. 15, 1963, dynamite attack. But he decided to
turn FBI informant after an agent showed him photographs of the
girls' mutilated bodies.</LD>
<TE>   "I told them I'd help them all I could," Burns said in an
interview with the Associated Press last year. "It was all because of
those pictures."</TE>
<TE>   For four years starting in 1964, Burns worked secretly as an
informant, making $200 a month. The agents paid Burns to have a
reel-to-reel tape recorder installed in the trunk of his car and to
secretly record conversations as he and a pair of fellow Klansmen --
Bobby Frank Cherry and Thomas Blanton Jr. -- drove from one bar to
the next during extended drinking binges.</TE>
<TE>   As the men drove, talked and joked, authorities were able to
capture damning snippets of conversation about bomb-making and the
explosion at 16th Street Baptist Church, which had been a place for
civil rights demonstrators to gather and plan strategy. The tapes
were played for jurors nearly 40 years later in separate trials of
Blanton, who was found guilty last year, and Cherry, convicted in
May. Both were sentenced to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to making the tapes, Burns testified that he overheard
Cherry make incriminating statements. Burns said Cherry told Blanton
that FBI agents did not know the bomb had been made in Cherry's
house. Cherry said, "They think we made the bomb somewhere else,"
according to Burns' testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the convicted bombers portrayed Burns as a liar and
ridiculed his work as an informant -- a job that consisted mostly of
beer-drinking and carousing. "We hit just about every honky-tonk
between here and Blount County," Burns testified during the trial of
Cherry, a onetime Marine trained in demolition. "When we got tired of
that, we hit every one between here and Bessemer."</TE>
<TE>   But Waddell characterized his former client as a hero who risked
his life to do what was right.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a lot of guts. He did something that was not very popular.
He did the right thing when it was not easy to do the right thing,"
Waddell said in a telephone interview. "They'd have killed him. Back
then, the Klan was in control -- and very mean."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a
Montgomery-based civil rights group, said Burns made it possible to
prosecute suspects in the bombing case many years later, no matter
what his motives were.</TE>
<TE>   "Sincere or not, Mitchell Burns clearly did the country a service
in this very important case," Potok said.</TE>
<TE>   The shocking spectacle of the four dead girls -- Cynthia Wesley,
Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Denise McNair, all of them
black and 14 years old except McNair, who was 11-- was a pivotal
moment in the civil rights era that helped galvanize white Americans
against racial oppression in the South.</TE>
<TE>   "This was really the case that was the tipping point," Potok said.</TE>
<TE>   Another Klansman, Robert Chambliss, died in prison after being
convicted in 1977. A fourth suspect, never charged, also died.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI had identified the Klansmen as suspects days after the
bombing, but closed the case at the direction of former Director J.
Edgar Hoover, who contended that an all-white Alabama jury would
never convict the men.</TE>
<TE>   The case was reopened in 1971 by then-Alabama Atty. Gen. Bill
Baxley, resulting in Chambliss' conviction, and gained additional
momentum after a 1993 meeting in Birmingham between FBI officials and
black ministers.</TE>
<TE>   Burns, who was 36 at the time of the bombings, said that after
drinking bouts, Blanton enjoyed sitting in the car outside the
church. "It was like he got a charge out of it," he said in the
interview last year.</TE>
<TE>   Burns and the two others were in different Klan groups. Burns
initially declined to help investigators when he was approached soon
after the bombing, but relented once he saw the morgue photographs.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to live with myself after this is over," Burns said last
year. "I've got to go home and look at myself in the mirror and I've
got to sleep. I can't lie and do that."</TE>

<HD>Max Reinhardt, 86; Publisher for Solzhenitsyn, Greene</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Book publisher Max Reinhardt, whose first signing was George Bernard
Shaw and who went on to publish works by Alexander Solzhenitsyn and
Graham Greene, is dead at the age of 86, his secretary said Thursday.
Reinhardt died Tuesday in a London nursing home, Belinda McGill said.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Istanbul -- then known as Constantinople -- on Nov. 30,
1915, to Austrian parents, Reinhardt was educated at the city's
English High School.</LD>
<LD>   He developed a love of British culture and, in 1938, persuaded his
parents to set up a branch of their import-export business in London
and put him in charge.</LD>
<TE>   After World War II service with the Royal Air Force in Northern
Ireland, Reinhardt took a course in international relations at the
London School of Economics. There, under tutors such as mathematician
and philosopher Bertrand Russell, he turned to literature.</TE>
<TE>   Later during a bridge game at London's Savile Club, Reinhardt met
the publisher A.S. Frere, who inspired Reinhardt to convert his
import and export business into a publishing house. He did so by
acquiring HFL Publishers, a small firm that specialized in accounting
textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt soon branched into the theatrical world, which he got to
know through his short-lived marriage in 1947 to the actress Margaret
Leighton.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw allowed Reinhardt to reissue the playwright's correspondence
with the actress Ellen Terry.</TE>
<TE>   However, when Reinhardt asked Shaw to write a new introduction to
the volume, Shaw retorted, "My dear boy, I don't remember a thing
about her."</TE>
<TE>   In 1957, Reinhardt and a merchant banker partner bought the Bodley
Head publishing house, where Reinhardt built a strong editing team,
naming Greene as director. Greene persuaded Charlie Chaplin to write
an autobiography and also brought his own work to Bodley Head. Bodley
Head became known as a publishing house that provided its authors
with tender, loving care, the loss of which was generally lamented in
the increasingly bottom-line publishing world.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1960s, Bodley Head signed the Soviet dissident writer
Solzhenitsyn -- who gave the company world publishing rights to
"Cancer Ward" -- Alistair Cooke, Maurice Sendak, William Trevor and
Eric Ambler. It also published Robert M. Pirsig's "Zen and the Art of
Motorcycle Maintenance" and Alvin Toffler's seminal work "Future
Shock."</TE>
<TE>   The group was later taken over by America's Random House, and
Reinhardt and Greene resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt retained HFL, renaming it Reinhardt Books, and continued
to publish under that and the Nonesuch Press imprints. The company
later came under the control of Viking.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt is survived by his wife, Joan, and their two daughters.</TE>

<AU>Marcy De Veaux</AU>
<BD>Marcy De Veaux is president of an entertainment public
relations firm and a six-year resident of Victoria Avenue.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine returning from a relaxing weekend getaway to discover your
quiet, tree-lined neighborhood has been visited by murder: Another
young, talented black man gunned down while sitting in a parked car
in the late hours of a Saturday night. Merlin Santana, at 26 an
accomplished actor, died just outside my front door.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles, the news media are accustomed to chasing this kind
of story: Satellite trucks, live shots, police tape -- you know all
of the visuals. And true to form, after Santana's death, there they
were, cruising up and down my street, covering the crime and looking
for signs of a neighborhood gone bad.</LD>
<LD>   They couldn't find what they sought. The lawns were manicured, the
shaded streets free of trash, abandoned cars and debris. Most
driveways contained expensive automobiles that had not been bought
with drug money or other ill-gotten funds. But the media
representatives couldn't help themselves.</LD>
<TE>   The reports went out on TV and radio: "We talked to neighbors who
said this crime-ridden community in South-Central L.A. ... "</TE>
<TE>   Ah, there it was, the code word: South-Central. News organization
in every American urban center have one: In Chicago, it's the South
Side. In Boston, it's Roxbury. In Houston, the Fifth Ward. Those, the
media supposes, are all places where crime happens, as if they are
nations and crime is the signature national product. Coverage is
always the same: News stories are always about blacks and Hispanics
living in poverty and neighborhoods riddled with felons.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't matter that the 3800 block of Victoria Avenue, where
Santana lost his life, was 12 miles from the heart of South-Central
Los Angeles. If it's a black neighborhood and south of Wilshire, it
must be in South-Central, mustn't it?</TE>
<TE>   So the code words were spoken: "murder in South-Central." The
consequence of presenting Santana's death in this fashion is not so
much hurting the feelings as hurting the reputation of a perfectly
fine neighborhood. The media are perpetuating the false sense of
security they give those who don't live in communities of color. Posh
Beverly Hills is only seven miles from the crime scene, much closer
than the real South-Central. But we wouldn't want to shake up our
wealthy neighbors to the west by referring to the crime scene as Los
Angeles' Westside.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is, if this tragedy could happen in the well-heeled
3800 block of Victoria, it could happen in any neighborhood in Los
Angeles. The code word is tantamount to saying: "Don't worry, it's
not in the good part of town -- no danger where you are." To paint
all communities of color with the same brush adds up to either lazy
journalism or something more insidious.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the result is the same: People who live in
neighborhoods that are not black and brown relax in a false sense of
security -- until something happens on their block. Then it's "an
isolated instance of shocking violence" in neighborhoods where it's
not supposed to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Well, it should not happen in my neighborhood or any other. But it
does, and on the 3800 block of Victoria we will mourn the loss of
Merlin Santana -- and our innocence -- while our insurance rates go
up and our property values go down.</TE>

<HD>Putting a Christian Spin on Gritty Crime Novels</HD>
<DH>James Scott Bell has written himself into an unusual niche
that traditionally has been reserved for the likes of Raymond
Chandler.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a writer of Christian thrillers, James Scott Bell's work is "about
as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food," to quote
one of his favorite authors, Raymond Chandler.</LD>
<LD>   Christian, suspense, hard-boiled, page-turner and novel are words
that usually don't keep company in sentences. But Bell, a 48-year-old
former trial attorney, has written himself into that very niche with
nine books since his debut novel in 1995. He's part of a literary
pack of new Christian authors who've helped double the sales for
faith-based fiction in the last seven years.</LD>
<LD>   The Woodland Hills resident's seven-year rise to the elite of
Christian fiction writers shows both his talent and the thin
competition in his genre. His first novel, "The Darwin Conspiracy,"
landed him a five-book contract "for more money than I ever imagined
I could make writing fiction."</LD>
<TE>   "I never expected to make a lot of money," he said. "I thought,
maybe I have a future in this."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, the number of novels classified by publishers as
Christian has grown from 500 to 1,800, many now published by
divisions of major houses such as Viking, Warner and Doubleday. At
Valley Book and Bible in Canoga Park, the fiction selection in recent
years has gone from 10 titles to 12 feet of bookshelf space, with
Bell being one of the more popular authors.</TE>
<TE>   "I love his books," said Heather Wilke, the store manager.
"There's depth, creativity, invention, and it's not always
predictable."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Bell was named Christian suspense writer of the
year for his novel "Final Witness." He was recently tapped as a
fiction columnist for Writer's Digest. His two-book-a-year pace
allows him to be under contract with two publishers, one for
historical thrillers set in the early 1900s in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He's been called the John Grisham of Christian suspense, but he
prefers to be measured against favorites such as Chandler and
Dashiell Hammett, the creator of private investigator Sam Spade.</TE>
<TE>   Bell's latest novel, the high-concept "Deadlock," was released
last month. The premise: What happens when a liberal U.S. Supreme
Court justice, the swing vote on a split court, has a religious
conversion that forces her to rethink her previous positions,
including her view on abortion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Secular Reviews</TE>
<TE>   The book has prompted a few mostly complimentary reviews in
secular magazines, like this one in the Library Journal: "Bell, a
lawyer known for solid Christian legal thrillers ('Final Witness'),
offers a thought-provoking fantasy about what might happen if a
staunch liberal becomes a conservative Christian, although he does
slip into didactic overload with his strong anti-abortion rhetoric.
... Strongly recommended for more conservative collections."</TE>
<TE>   Publishers Weekly paid this compliment that he savored: "Laudably,
most characters are multidimensional."</TE>
<TE>   Bell says it's part of his being a Christian to feel sympathy for
all his characters, even the villains.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can understand and know what their motivations are, maybe
we can even have a little sympathy for them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bell's path to becoming a popular Christian author began as a
teenager while watching a Billy Graham crusade on television. Though
his parents were not churchgoers, he got on his knees before the TV
and converted to Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an incredible feeling of warmth that washed over me, and I
felt I was connected to something higher than just this world," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Before writing his first novel, Bell, a graduate of UC Santa
Barbara and USC law school, spent 19 years as an actor in theater and
commercials in New York, a litigator and a screenwriter (he says he
had two of his works optioned but not produced).</TE>
<TE>   But for the committed Christian who has taught Sunday school for
17 years, a faith-based novel was the only way he could write freely
about the issues that intrigued him most: abortion, evolution,
biotechnology and faith under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing for me is to write about the big
philosophical issues without having to restrain myself in any way,"
said Bell, a married father of two who also continues to publish
legal reference books on search and seizure law.</TE>
<TE>   His daily routine is to write about 1,200 words of fiction in the
morning and work on his legal publishing business in the afternoon.
He also spends a fair amount of time encouraging other young writers,
Christian or otherwise, by speaking at conferences and offering
writing tips on his Web site (www.jamesscott bell.com).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Closing the Gap</TE>
<TE>   There's still a sizable literary gap between the top evangelical
novelists and their secular counterparts, but the space has closed
dramatically in the last five years. Bell says one challenge is to
write fiction that's theologically important but leaves the sermons
for the pulpit.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell a good story and to weave in the spirit themes is
difficult unless you have compelling characters and follow them," he
said. "I don't want to be preachy."</TE>
<TE>   Bell says his aim is to come up with a page-turning concept and
then let characters, including strong Christian protagonists and
others searching for spiritual meaning, tell the story.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is to write books that aren't less in quality than the
best you'd find on the secular shelves," he said. "It's no longer
acceptable for us to just write a thinly veiled sermon and have it
published."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his current success, Bell says he'll remain with Christian
publishers, not feeling the need to prove himself in the mainstream
literary world.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd had some offers to try that," he said. "But my feeling is
that God has given me this avenue and I'm going to do it the best I
can. If something happens to cross over, like the 'Left Behind'
series did, then fine."</TE>

<HD>Southland Jews Debate Criticism of Israeli Policies</HD>
<DH>A petition by leading rabbis and scholars cites growing
intolerance of dissidence in U.S. Jewish community. Others say the
times demand unity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Teresa Watanabe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of prominent Jewish intellectuals in Southern California is
urging the American Jewish community to "reopen the channels of free
debate," asserting that the prolonged Mideast crisis has created
growing intolerance here for criticism of the Israeli government or
compassion for the Palestinian people.</LD>
<LD>   "In the name of unity in the time of crisis, the great Jewish
tradition of vibrant and open debate has given way to a single
voice," read a statement signed by 37 mostly liberal scholars, rabbis
and other prominent figures published this week in the Jewish Journal
of Greater Los Angeles. The statement urged Jews to "recover the
principles of tolerance, responsibility, and empathy that animate the
Jewish political tradition."</LD>
<LD>   Several community leaders who did not join the statement
challenged the assertion that liberal views are being quashed.
According to John Fishel, president of the Jewish Federation of
Greater Los Angeles, his organization has featured speakers across
the political spectrum, including former Israeli Prime Ministers
Benjamin Netanyahu on the right and, just six weeks ago, Ehud Barak
on the left.</LD>
<TE>   Others sympathetic to the statement's content questioned its
timing. Rabbi Harold Schulweis of Valley Beth Shalom congregation in
Encino, for instance, said he declined an invitation to sign the
statement because he believed Israel should not be criticized during
this time of great duress. He called for a "moratorium" on criticism
until the crisis eases.</TE>
<TE>   Others went further, calling the statement harmful to Israel.
"Their intentions may be noble, but the result is that they're giving
strength and support to forces whose true intent is the destruction
of the state of Israel," said Rabbi David Eliezrie, president of the
Rabbinical Council of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   But David N. Myers, professor and vice chair of the UCLA history
department, who initiated the statement, said he believes that it is
precisely in times of crisis that a variety of viewpoints should be
aired to help the Jewish people make informed decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Myers said he was spurred to act after seeing himself and others
branded as disloyal in the past several months for criticizing some
Israeli government policies. He also expressed concern that some
synagogues, including his own, had allowed organizations to
disseminate material he called "unfortunate historical revisionism"
such as a pamphlet that referred to the so-called Israeli occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Others who signed the statement said they had witnessed or
experienced threats, heckling at community forums and steps by donors
to withdraw funds from organizations as a result of disagreements
over events in Israel. In one incident that attracted considerable
attention within the Jewish community, a member of Stand With Us, a
group that supports current Israeli policies, attacked the head of
the UCLA Hillel program, Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, likening him to
Jewish figures who were accused of helping the Nazis. The critic
later apologized.</TE>
<TE>   Myers and others took pains to emphasize their deep love of
Israel. The statement itself emphasizes strong support for the Jewish
state, condemns violence against Israeli citizens and expresses deep
concern about anti-Semitic incidents, especially on college campuses.</TE>
<TE>   But it rejects the notion that anti-Semitism had become a serious
danger to American Jews. And it expresses empathy for the pain of
Israeli Jews and Palestinians alike, declaring both peoples to be
"created in the image of God" and calling the end of the Israeli
occupation an "overriding moral imperative" under the Jewish
tradition.</TE>
<TE>   One backer of the statement, Rabbi Susan Laemmle, dean of
religious life at USC, said the pressure to close ranks on Israel had
created a chilling effect on discourse on campus and made her job of
fostering collegial relations among faith groups more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Another signer, USC constitutional law professor Erwin
Chemerinsky, said he had engaged in "countless conversations with
people who have taken criticism of what Israel is doing as criticism
of Israel itself," even though his criticism of U.S. policies is
never seen as an attack on America itself.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of the statement included such noted intellectuals as
Rabbi Elliot Dorff of the University of Judaism and several scholars
and rabbis from the Los Angeles campus of Hebrew Union College-Jewish
Institute of Religion, including Dean Lewis M. Barth and Rabbi Reuven
Firestone, a noted scholar of Islam and Judaism. Other signers
included representatives from Jewish peace groups and the Progressive
Jewish Alliance.</TE>

<LD>For what is thought to be the first time, a Vatican document is being
published in Welsh.</LD>
<LD>   Significantly, the document is concerned with Christian unity. The
document, published in English as "The Search for Christian Unity,"
is titled in Welsh "Chwilio am Undod Cristnogol."</LD>
<LD>   The document was released this week at the Welsh Center for
Ecumenical Studies at Trinity College, Carmarthen, by the three
Catholic bishops of Wales: Archbishop Peter Smith of Cardiff, Bishop
Edwin Regan of Wrexham and Bishop Mark Jabale of Menevia. Of the
three, only Regan, whose episcopal motto is in Welsh, is a Welsh
speaker: His two colleagues are still learning the language.</LD>

<HD>French Jews' Faith Grows, Survey Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>A third of French Jews are more religious today than 14 years ago. At
the same time, nearly 40% of younger Jews marry outside the faith.</LD>
<LD>   The profile of Western Europe's largest but dwindling Jewish
population is captured in a new study by the Paris-based Unified
Jewish Social Fund. The survey of more than 1,000 Jews is considered
the most comprehensive look in years at the Jewish community in
France.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a double movement," said David Saada, general director
of the Social Fund, assessing the survey's often contradictory
findings. "On the one hand, there's a greater affirmation of Jewish
identity, but also an increase in marriages outside the community --
which doesn't necessarily mean abandoning the Jewish faith.</LD>
<TE>   "The conclusion is that the Jewish community in France is very
diverse, with contradictory tendencies," Saada said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   About 500,000 French citizens declare themselves Jews, the study
found, but their numbers rise to 575,000 when the children of mixed
couples are taken into account. That figure is roughly comparable to
the number of Jewish residents of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Jews who consider themselves to be observant tend to be
less educated and less well off than those who don't, according to
the report. Nearly half of French Jews were born in France -- a
slight increase from 1988 -- but nearly 70% have roots in France's
former North African colonies.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II has pledged to pursue ecumenical dialogue aimed at
achieving full visible unity between Catholics and Lutherans.</LD>
<LD>   The 82-year-old Roman Catholic pontiff met with a delegation from
the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros in Norway, led by Bishop Finn Wagle,
in Rome to celebrate the feast day of St. Olav, patron of Norway.</LD>
<LD>   "We are committed to moving further ahead on the path to
reconciliation," the pope said, addressing the group in English.</LD>
<TE>   John Paul cited as landmarks in ecumenical relations his visit to
Norway and the other predominantly Lutheran countries of Scandinavia
in 1993 and the signing of the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of
Justification by the Lutheran World Federation and the Catholic
Church in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The signing ended a dispute that had lasted 482 years over how
people achieve salvation.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, Lutherans had stressed that salvation comes from
God's grace alone, while Roman Catholics saw an important role for
the works people perform.</TE>
<TE>   "May the Lord help us to treasure what has been achieved so far,
and may he sustain us in our efforts to hasten its development into
ever broader cooperation," the pope said.</TE>
<TE>   "May we ever remain open to the surprising work of the Holy Spirit
among us," the pontiff added.</TE>

<HD>Bush Hails Sikhs on Founder's Birthday</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush sent greetings to America's Sikhs as they celebrate
the birthday of Guru Nanak, the founder of their faith.</LD>
<LD>   "America is strengthened by the rich cultural and religious
diversity of its people," the president said in his message,
according to a statement from the Sikh Council on Religion and
Education. "By preserving your customs and sharing your loving and
compassionate faith, Sikhs contribute to America's vibrant spiritual
foundation."</LD>
<LD>   Rajwant Singh, chairman of the Sikh Council, said in a statement
that the presidential message "is very assuring and healing,
particularly at this time when many Sikhs have felt insecure in the
aftermath of [the] Sept. 11 tragedy."</LD>
<TE>   Sikhs, with their distinctive dress, became targets of attacks in
several parts of the country after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The presidential greeting "validates our belief that America
remains a country where immigrants are accepted and where their

<LD>The Anglican Church of Canada has reached an agreement with the
Canadian government over how to pay compensation to thousands of
Native Americans who say they were abused at church-run residential
schools.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, announced this week after years of negotiations, will
see the Anglican Church pay 30% of claims against the schools it ran,
to a maximum of $25 million Canadian dollars. Taxpayers would be
responsible for the rest.</LD>
<LD>   The Canadian government financed the schools as part of its
attempt to assimilate natives to Christian, European culture.</LD>

<HD>Church May Close Seminary</HD>

<AU>Erika Hayasaki and Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles is studying plans to
close its four-year undergraduate college program for future priests
at St. John's Seminary in Camarillo by next fall.</LD>
<LD>   In three years, the archdiocese may consider moving the entire
seminary to or near Loyola Marymount University in the Westchester
area of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony said Friday that he and the seminary
board of directors will decide in January whether to shut down the
undergraduate program at St. John's, which enrolls 90 students,
compared to 150 three decades ago. The program's closure would save
the archdiocese nearly $3 million a year, the cardinal said, an
appreciated cost-cutting measure at a time when it is trying to close
a $4.3-million deficit.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously it will save us some money, but this has been on track
for a long time," Mahony said. "This is a very positive step. It is
keeping with the renewal going on in the church today, and it will
fit the needs of the men who are entering our seminary today."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said the undergraduate program is no longer needed because
there has been a decline in applicants and many already have a
bachelor's degree before enrolling. In 1961, when St. John's opened,
many applicants were high school graduates, he said, but that trend
has shifted over the last two decades toward older applicants.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not getting large numbers of high school seniors and,
frankly, that's not the group we're looking for," Mahony said. "We're
looking for people who have been out in the real world and have a
little bit more maturity."</TE>
<TE>   Proposals to phase out the college were presented to the seminary
board of directors Friday by a special task force Mahony established
in August to examine how to better prepare men for ordination as well
as to save money.</TE>
<TE>   The options included admitting only applicants who already have a
bachelor's degree to receive six years of religious training leading
to a master's degree in philosophy, or admitting applicants who have
at least an associate's degree and allowing them to earn bachelor's
and master's degrees in philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   However, the task force, said the entire seminary and its graduate
programs may have to be relocated to Loyola Marymount if the
"stand-alone seminary model does not prove to be viable for
programmatic, financial or pastoral reasons." That would be reviewed
in three years.</TE>
<TE>   "We would be getting out of the business of giving bachelor's
degrees," said the Rev. Gregory Chisholm, one of the members of the
task force.</TE>
<TE>   If the college closes, the undergraduates who are not seniors will
be offered assistance to find other universities to finish their
degrees, Chisholm said.</TE>
<TE>   Students at the hilltop campus in Camarillo said they knew closure
was a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he planned to do if the school closed, John Nguyen, 23,
of Chico said: "Pray, I guess."</TE>

<HD>Boy Receives Stem-Cell Transplant</HD>
<DH>'It's his rebirth day,' mother says as the 3-year-old
undergoes procedure to fight Sanfilippo syndrome, a rare genetic
disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DURHAM, N.C.</DL>
<LD>DURHAM, N.C. -- Three-year-old Tommy Bennett's only hope for
long-term survival arrived Friday morning -- after days of
chemotherapy, weeks of medical tests and months of fighting between
his parents and their HMO.</LD>
<LD>   Tommy, of Ione, Calif., received a stem-cell transplant, derived
from a newborn baby's umbilical cord blood, at 11:25 a.m. at Duke
University Medical Center here. The hope is that the stem cells will
replace enzymes he is missing because of Sanfilippo syndrome, a rare
but fatal genetic disease that afflicts one in 70,000 children. Those
afflicted usually die by their early teens.</LD>
<LD>   Though the transplant is Tommy's only possibility for a reprieve,
the 30-minute procedure was somewhat anticlimactic. There were no
incisions. No anesthesia. No bandages. Unlike a liver or heart
transplant, this one was more like a simple blood transfusion than
invasive surgery.</LD>
<TE>   "It's his rebirth day," said Alicia Bennett, Tommy's mother.
"There's no turning back now."</TE>
<TE>   Tommy remained awake during the transplant, watching a "Barney"
video and playing with a toy hammer-and-nails set and a Chicken Dance
Elmo doll. He wore a red T-shirt emblazoned with the words "Kids
rule" and a red hat with the transplant unit's slogan, "Grow cells
grow."</TE>
<TE>   The toughest challenges are ahead. In the coming days, he will
lose his hair and develop painful sores in his mouth and throat from
the chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy will also be at high risk of deadly infections and organ
failure because the chemotherapy drugs have wiped out his immune
system. About 10% of children who undergo similar procedures die from
complications.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative was certain death. Sanfilippo children lack an
enzyme needed to break down chains of sugar molecules. As they age,
the molecules are stored in their cells, causing progressive organ
damage that is ultimately lethal.</TE>
<TE>   During the transplant, 1 billion healthy stem cells (in 55
milliliters of fluid) were infused into Tommy's body through a chest
tube.</TE>
<TE>   In a process that still baffles researchers, those cells travel to
the bone marrow and begin producing new cells with the missing
enzyme. They are then carried throughout the body.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know how they do it, but they do," said Dr. Joanne
Kurtzberg, director of the pediatric stem-cell transplant program at
Duke. "Nature is doing most of the work. We're just facilitating it."</TE>
<TE>   The cells were drawn from a healthy boy born May 4, 2000, with the
consent of his parents. The cells had been kept in a liquid-nitrogen
freezer at minus 196 degrees Celsius. It will take up to four weeks
to know whether the transplanted stem cells have engrafted and
successfully given Tommy a new immune system.</TE>
<TE>   One of the five other Sanfilippo children who have undergone the
transplant needed a second one because his first didn't take.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctor came in last night and said, 'It's been easy so far,'
" said Alicia Bennett, who will sleep at the hospital during Tommy's
stay. "Now is when it's going to get hard."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Tommy survives the transplant, there are no published
studies showing that it will stop the progression of his disease. The
first Sanfilippo child received her cord-blood transplant in February
2001, and a second took place three months later.</TE>
<TE>   Magnetic resonance imaging tests on the brains of those two
children show significant improvement, and their developmental skills
have remained stable, or improved slightly, since the transplants.</TE>
<TE>   But because the damage caused by Sanfilippo occurs slowly,
research on whether children with transplants avoid that decline will
take years.</TE>
<TE>   The Bennetts noted that luck so far has not been on their side.
Their two other children -- Hunter, 6, and Ciara, 4 -- also have
Sanfilippo, and testing showed that the illness had progressed too
far in both, stranding them on the path to early death.</TE>
<TE>   The couple fought for months to convince their insurer, Kaiser
Permanente, to pay for the treatment. After an independent panel of
medical experts upheld Kaiser's denial, the couple took their case to
the media.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Kaiser agreed to donate $1 million to Duke for
Sanfilippo research, more than enough to cover the cost of Tommy's
transplant.</TE>
<TE>   John Bennett said the fight with Kaiser needlessly delayed
treatment for Tommy.</TE>
<TE>   Kurtzberg said the Bennetts have held up well during the
transplant process. "I don't think [Tommy] really understands what's
going on," she said. "With a child this age, the parents are more the
patients than the child.... And they've been great."</TE>

<HD>State Says Apparent Lie Led to D.A. Taping</HD>

<LD>The state attorney general's office said Friday that its
secret-recording operation at the Orange County district attorney's
office was launched after prosecutors came to believe that a top
district attorney's official lied to law enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, said the
investigation did not result in any criminal charges. He did not
disclose the target of the probe but said it was not Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas.</LD>
<LD>   The attorney general had directed Michael Clesceri, the assistant
chief of investigations for Rackauckas, to secretly record fellow
employees.</LD>
<TE>   Barankin said the recording occurred last year after Rackauckas
requested the attorney general's help in a case. Rackauckas wanted
the office to determine whether two investigators in his office stole
audiotapes relating to a case involving a friend, Newport Beach
businessman Patrick DiCarlo.</TE>
<TE>   "During the course of that investigation, we received reliable
information that a high-ranking official in the district attorney's
office had lied," Barankin said.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   "We authorized the use of a wire for the exclusive and narrow
purpose of trying to corroborate whether that official had indeed
lied," Barankin added. "This was for a narrow purpose, a very narrow
window of time and for a specific reason. We were able to corroborate
that that official had lied, but we did not file charges."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas declined to comment for this story.</TE>

<HD>Straying Stanton Girl's Mother, Man Held</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after making tearful pleas for her daughter's return, the
mother of an 11-year-old Stanton girl who ran away with a man she met
through a chat room was arrested Friday on charges of child
endangerment. The man was also arrested, accused of sexually abusing
the girl.</LD>
<LD>   Diane Ponce, 28, was being held at the Central Women's Jail in
Santa Ana. Her 11-year-old daughter, a 5-year-old daughter and her
14-year-old son were placed in protective custody at the Orangewood
Children's Home, said sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino.</LD>
<LD>   "She was part of the problem, and not the solution," Amormino said
of Ponce.</LD>
<TE>   Ponce spent 30 days in jail last year on a previous child
endangerment charge and was taking parenting classes, authorities
said. It was not immediately clear whether the previous arrest
involved the same daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The girl was with a 9-year-old friend outside their apartment
complex on West 2nd Street in Stanton on Tuesday when a dark sport
utility vehicle pulled up.</TE>
<TE>   A witness said she hopped into the passenger seat, leaving
voluntarily with the man at the wheel, but not telling anyone where
she was going.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother did not report her missing until midnight Wednesday,
apparently under the false impression that she had to wait 24 hours.
The Sheriff's Department put more than 60 investigators and uniformed
deputies to work looking for the girl.</TE>
<TE>   They found her at a motel about 10 miles from her home about 11:30
p.m. Thursday, about 12 hours after she was spotted with an older man
at a Long Beach music store.</TE>
<TE>   The man, Alfredo Teran, 20, was arrested by Long Beach police and
charged with committing lewd acts on a child, continuous sexual abuse
of a child and oral copulation. He was being held on $50,000 bond.
Investigators believe the girl met Teran while on an Internet or
telephone chat line about a week ago.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Pupil Says He's Learned to Care About the Homeless</HD>
<DH>High school juniors gain new insight as they give up
showers and beds in an effort to empathize with those who live on the
street.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Manuel Olague started caring about the homeless this week after years
of ignoring them.</LD>
<LD>   "I used to blame homeless people for being that way because they
had given up on themselves," said the 16-year-old, who now drops
dollars into the charity buckets outside his neighborhood grocery
store in Irvine. "Now I've seen that for the vast majority it's not
their fault."</LD>
<LD>   His conversion -- developed over the last week as one of 150
Irvine High School juniors who gave up showers and beds in an effort
to empathize with the homeless -- may last awhile if senior Chris
Amber's experience is any guide.</LD>
<TE>   Chris took part in Project Safety Net last year when it was
launched by HomeAid America, a Costa Mesa-based national organization
that builds shelters for the homeless. HomeAid organizers saw it as a
worthwhile exercise for National Hunger and Homeless Week, and Irvine
High was the only school to sign up.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction was so positive from students like Chris and their
parents that the principal asked HomeAid if the project could be held
there this year.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine High students tend to think of their sheltered community,
where about 5% are below the poverty level, as unaffected by social
ills.</TE>
<TE>   That myth was shattered for Chris last year when he realized
several classmates were or had been homeless. Months afterward, he
realized how his perceptions had changed.</TE>
<TE>   While flipping through his middle school yearbook this week, Chris
said he became angry when he spotted a photo of a teacher dressed up
for Halloween as a homeless person with a shopping cart.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then I thought it was hilarious," he said. "But this project
totally transformed my feelings toward how I saw homeless people. A
year later, that hasn't left me."</TE>
<TE>   This year's exercise was much the same, with students encouraged
to sacrifice tangible and psychological comforts. They begged for
lunch money, shunned their usual social groups and wore the same
clothes without showering for three days. However, instead of asking
the students to sleep in their cars at home as was done last year,
HomeAid organized a sleepover in the school parking lot. The project
is expected to expand next year to schools near other HomeAid
chapters.</TE>
<TE>   HomeAid officials hope Project Safety Net will have a ripple
effect among students.</TE>
<TE>   "We want them to understand that they're dealing with real people
and not a bunch of stereotypical drunks with shopping carts," HomeAid
chief executive Michael Lennon said.</TE>
<TE>   "These students can take a leadership role in breaking down those
myths."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the students visited House of Hope, a homeless shelter
in Orange for women and children.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Machado, 28, who has lived at the shelter for more than a
year, guided the students through the room that she shares with her
two sons and the house's living areas.</TE>
<TE>   Machado told them she began living on the streets at 14 after
deciding not to attend high school.</TE>
<TE>   "This project is a good opportunity for them to open their eyes to
what it's like to be in my shoes," Machado said. "It's not fun.
Hopefully some part of this will sink in and they'll make better
choices than I did."</TE>

<HD>Arbitrator Biased in His Ruling Against Her, Billionaire
Says</HD>
<DH>Newspaper owner claims retired high court justice held a
grudge because he felt she wasn't paying his fees promptly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Johnson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Billionaire newspaper owner and environmentalist Wendy McCaw is
taking on a retired state Supreme Court justice who recently ruled
against her in a lawsuit filed by her former fiance.</LD>
<LD>   Private arbitrator David N. Eagleson awarded attorney Gregory
Parker $14.8 million, and called McCaw's conduct against him
"oppressive, meaning despicable."</LD>
<LD>   Eagleson also accused McCaw of using her newspaper, the Santa
Barbara News-Press, to smear Parker's reputation.</LD>
<TE>   Now McCaw has filed an appeal, contending that Eagleson was
biased. In legal papers, she said the retired justice kicked her
attorney out of meetings and held a grudge against her because he
felt she wasn't paying his fees promptly. Arbitrators hear cases when
both parties agree and are paid directly by the litigants.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Parker wants $15 million for 13 months of employment," said
McCaw attorney Sue McCollum. "Mrs. McCaw is only asking the court to
protect her contractual right to a fair hearing before three
impartial arbitrators."</TE>
<TE>   McCaw didn't become one of America's richest women by being afraid
to slug it out with powerful men. And she has often prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   When she divorced cellular phone visionary Craig McCaw a decade
ago, she assembled her own legal dream team and won one of the
largest divorce settlements in history.</TE>
<TE>   She outmaneuvered Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner for her
oceanfront estate in the exclusive Hope Ranch neighborhood, then
battled state Coastal Commission plans to open the beach below to the
public.</TE>
<TE>   Eagleson was the arbitrator in a lawsuit that Parker filed when he
was fired by McCaw two years ago after serving as a legal advisor.
Parker accused her of reneging on an agreement to pay him millions of
dollars in deferred compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Parker met McCaw seven years ago when she was house-hunting in
Santa Barbara. After helping her find the historic estate in Hope
Ranch, Parker was hired to work exclusively for McCaw.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, the relationship developed from a business partnership
into a romantic one. The two vacationed together, including trips to
her yacht in the Mediterranean, where they announced plans to marry.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship fell apart in 1999, and McCaw fired Parker a year
later. McCaw defended herself against his suit by charging that he
took advantage of her after her divorce and that he was only
interested in her money.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Eagleson didn't buy that.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no evidence of malice on the part of Parker," he wrote.
"All he wanted was for McCaw to honor her contractual obligations and
sued to enforce those obligations, as he had the right to do."</TE>
<TE>   Eagleson also said McCaw used her newspaper to try to ruin
Parker's reputation in town.</TE>
<TE>   "She and her litigation counsel hired a public relations expert
whose function was to place articles in her newspaper complimentary
to herself and derogatory of Parker in an effort to create a
community animus toward Parker," he ruled.</TE>
<TE>   The idea that she had crossed the line from covering the news to
slanting it was an especially raw point for McCaw. She had been
fending off similar accusations since she purchased the News-Press
from New York Times Co. two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the animal lover and vegetarian was using the paper
as a lectern, citing editorials supporting a meatless Thanksgiving
and opinion columns repeatedly blasting the Coastal Commission.</TE>
<TE>   McCaw has steadfastly denied telling her writers and editors what
to put in the paper.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Eagleson's charge, News-Press Editor Jerry Roberts
said he has covered the McCaw story the way he would news about "any
other powerful person."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts has only been on the job since June. But he said he has
gone back and read previous stories on the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "My reading of those stories is that that is not an accurate
statement," he said of Eagleson's condemnation. Roberts, who had a
long and distinguished career in journalism before arriving at the
News-Press, said he has felt no pressure from McCaw or her
representatives.</TE>
<TE>   In their latest legal filing, McCaw's lawyers ask that Eagleson's
award be set aside because "the arbitrator clearly disfavored Mrs.
McCaw."</TE>
<TE>   "Before and after my divorce I made the mistake of trusting Greg
Parker with everything, financial and personal," McCaw said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've moved forward, but I'm opposing his claim to my assets
because I believe what he did is wrong -- legally, ethically and
morally."</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to reach Eagleson for comment were unsuccessful. But he
filed a declaration in response to McCaw's charges, saying he did
nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The document indicates that he was upset by delays in paying his
expenses, but he said he had no idea why the delays were occurring
and did not blame McCaw for them. "I was not keeping score on who was
paying bills, because I did not know," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Foley, Parker's attorney, noted that both parties agreed on
Eagleson as an arbitrator. "Justice David Eagleson is a man of
unquestioned character and integrity," Foley said.</TE>
<TE>   Eagleson is a 1950 graduate of the USC School of Law and worked in
private practice until 1970, when he took a seat on the Los Angeles
County Superior Court. In 1984, he was appointed to the 2nd District
Court of Appeal. Gov. George Deukmejian then named him to the state
Supreme Court, on which Eagleson served as an associate justice from
1987 to 1991. He wrote 53 court opinions. He has worked as an
arbitrator through the American Arbitration Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Kersten Norlin, a spokeswoman for the group, said its arbitrators
are held to the highest standards in terms of reputations for
fairness and accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   Norlin said the number of cases handled annually by the
association has more than doubled in the last four years to 218,000.</TE>
<TE>   McCaw's complaint will be heard Dec. 16 by Judge J. William
McLafferty.</TE>

<HD>Band on Run Exults in Homecoming</HD>
<DH>No Doubt, on last leg of world tour, gets keys to the city
of Anaheim, the hometown it mocked in album 'Tragic Kingdom.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No Doubt, the Anaheim-born band that dubbed its home the "Tragic
Kingdom" en route to rock stardom, Friday returned to the town it
lampooned for the ultimate civic honor.</LD>
<LD>   That's right, the keys to the city.</LD>
<LD>   Band members received the distinction at Disneyland, no less, the
same place they poked fun at in the multiplatinum album "Tragic
Kingdom," which includes images of rotten oranges and lyrics mocking
the Seven Dwarfs and the hallowed Main Street Electrical Parade.</LD>
<TE>   They came home to the town where they spent their youth, attended
high school football games and struggled to find themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Although they may now be a world-famous band, on Friday morning
they seemed more like the kids next door. When the band came out on
stage, lead singer Gwen Stefani searched the crowd for her mother.</TE>
<TE>   And when Mayor Tom Daly handed over the ceremonial keys, an honor
not even bestowed on Walt Disney, the band's parents and grandparents
were in the audience, snapping photos like the rest of the groupies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like coming full circle," said bass player Tony Kanal. "Who
would have ever thought we would be here?"</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Leena Kanal, still works in the city's finance
department. She ranked Friday's achievement up there with the band's
first record deal. And Gulab Kanal, who once ushered his
saxophone-playing son to jazz band practice at South Junior High in
Anaheim, called it a milestone.</TE>
<TE>   The band has such a connection to Anaheim that one fan joked that
locals like to play "six degrees of separation" with No Doubt because
they know someone who knows someone who has some connection to the
group.</TE>
<TE>   Before their early morning breakfast concert, compliments of radio
station KROQ and the Kevin &amp; Bean Show, band members pondered those
early days, recalling their favorite Anaheim restaurant -- Mexi-Casa
Mexican Food ("We lived on that for years and years and years,"
drummer Adrian Young said). They also mentioned the time they took
sips of alcohol at Disneyland, a rite of passage of sorts among
Orange County's more adventurous youth.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to work at Disneyland," Stefani said. "I wanted to sing
songs at the Disneyland Hotel. ... Videopolis was here. I used to
come dancing here."</TE>
<TE>   This visit, she didn't have to pay to get in. And if there were
any sore feelings about No Doubt's digs at the Magic Kingdom, they
were forgotten Friday and the band was treated like royalty.</TE>
<TE>   Disney rolled out the red carpet, putting up No Doubt in a suite
at the Grand Californian Hotel, with rooms overlooking California
Adventure. The musicians spent Thursday night riding roller coasters.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the band has moved beyond its Orange County roots,
trading the Anaheim Beacon Street digs where it once recorded its
aptly-titled "Beacon Street Collection" album for more glamorous
environs in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they said Friday, there's no place like home.</TE>
<TE>   A fan asked them their favorite venue to perform, including the
spots in Europe and Asia they hit this year as part of their Rock
Steady tour, which wraps up Nov. 30 at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to say rolling into Anaheim and getting a suite at

<HD>Agency Seeks to Fend Off Power Shortages</HD>
<DH>Energy authority debates ways to prevent blackouts and high
costs. Low electricity prices have discouraged investment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>With all the ingredients converging for a future electricity
shortage, the state public power agency is extending a hand to a
humbled, hobbled energy industry.</LD>
<LD>   The authority met Friday to debate how it might prevent a return
of high prices and blackouts as battered energy companies shut down
aging power plants and scuttle plans for new ones.</LD>
<LD>   Within the next decade, California faces an electricity shortfall
equal to the amount of power needed to supply nearly 4 million homes,
according to one expert's testimony.</LD>
<TE>   The quickest way to prevent a supply crunch, the power authority
board concluded, is through long-term contracts that commit the state
or utilities to buy electricity at prices high enough to cover the
cost of building new power plants or babying old ones.</TE>
<TE>   After soaring to more than $300 per megawatt-hour in the winter of
2001, wholesale power prices have been stuck at $30 or less for the
past year. Such chronically low prices have discouraged investment.
And accounting and market manipulation scandals have pushed some
energy companies toward bankruptcy and frightened bankers from
lending them money.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had companies come in and talk to us in the last few
days, saying they are losing money operating their old plants and
they can't keep it up without contracts," said S. David Freeman,
chairman of the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing
Authority. "We're vulnerable to being manipulated again, perhaps even
legally."</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, he said, he has talked with "almost everybody in
this business" about using the power authority's ability to borrow
money relatively cheaply to help companies keep their plants running
and launch new construction.</TE>
<TE>   AES Corp., for example, needs $5 million to finish refurbishing a
Huntington Beach generator that could produce enough electricity to
supply 150,000 homes. The unit has been fitted with state-of-the-art
air pollution control equipment, said Mark Woodruff, president of
AES' Western division.</TE>
<TE>   But banks are not willing to finance the final stage of
modernization until AES signs a contract to sell the electricity, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day," said Woodruff, "any new investment in
power infrastructure has to come with a clear path to how you recoup
that investment."</TE>
<TE>   "We would be interested in talking to any entity interested in
helping to fund completion of that investment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In its 18-month existence, the public power authority has avoided
getting into the construction business. It has invested instead in
conservation, renewable power sources and programs that pay
businesses to curtail consumption when electricity demand soars.</TE>
<TE>   But the board vowed Friday to keep a close eye on the state's
private utilities, which were crippled by the state's attempt at
deregulation, as they ease back into the business of buying
electricity in January. And the board considered asking state
regulators to earmark a portion of utility customers' bills to fund
its work.</TE>
<TE>   With such a guarantee, the agency could use its legal authority to
borrow as much as $5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, though, the board members said, the utilities -- Southern
California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp;
Electric -- would negotiate enough new contracts to safeguard the
state from a future supply crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman warned that, to encourage construction, the public must be
willing to accept contract prices higher than those on the spot
market.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, as an advisor to Gov. Gray Davis, Freeman helped
negotiate dozens of long-term power contracts. The contracts spared
the state from exorbitant spot market prices for several months, but
they were roundly criticized after market prices fell in June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Today the average megawatt-hour under the contracts costs twice as
much as it would in the market.</TE>
<TE>   Still, about 40% of the power plants built in California in the
last two years or now under construction belong to companies with
state contracts, said Vikram Budhraja, a consultant to the
power-buying division within the state Department of Water Resources.</TE>
<TE>   He said that California -- with a peak demand of roughly 50,000
megawatts -- added 4,400 megawatts of electricity-generating capacity
this year and last, with facilities to generate 5,000 megawatts more
now under construction.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several years, he said, a gap in supply will grow as
the state's contracts expire and electricity demand increases at a
pace of 500 to 1,000 megawatts each year -- the capacity of a major
power plant.</TE>
<TE>   The burden of preventing a shortage falls to the power authority,
which was created by the Legislature and governor to guarantee that
the state never again found itself at the mercy of private power
generators.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis appointees to the authority seemed keenly aware of where
blame will fall, should the electricity crisis return.</TE>
<TE>   "If it doesn't come together," said board member Don Vial,
"there's obviously no place to go but here."</TE>

<LD>The amount of drugs seized at five California border crossings fell
for the first time in four years, reflecting a post-Sept. 11 security
crackdown and stepped-up enforcement in Colombia and Mexico,
authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Customs Service inspectors seized 158 tons of heroin,
cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine over the last 12 months. A
year ago, the total was more than 244 tons.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities were reluctant to pat themselves on the back, noting
that seizures had risen in Texas and New Mexico, which suggests
smugglers may be looking eastward.</LD>

<HD>Sentencing in Van Dam Murder, Kidnapping Delayed Until Jan.
3</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The sentencing of David Westerfield for the kidnapping and murder of
Danielle van Dam was delayed Friday, but the judge overseeing the
case scoffed at a defense request regarding a magazine story.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorney Steven Feldman had asked Superior Court Judge
William Mudd to force the writer of a story in San Diego magazine to
disclose the source of an anonymous quote indicating that police
believe the 7-year-old may have been killed in her bedroom, not after
being kidnapped.</LD>
<LD>   Mudd said that the motion was one of the easiest to reject he has
ever encountered. "It appears to me to be nothing more than the
speculative belief of some unnamed police source," Mudd said of the
quote.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Mudd delayed the sentencing until Jan. 3 because Feldman
has not filed a motion to appeal the jury's death sentence, which the
defense is required to do in California. Mudd will decide whether to
sentence the 50-year-old design engineer to death or life in prison
without parole.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really let down by the decision" to delay the sentencing,
said Brenda van Dam, Danielle's mother. "We wanted to have this part
behind us for the holidays.... It's a game to [Feldman]."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred, now representing the Van Dam
family, said the girl's parents "plan to devote a significant portion
of their lives to protecting other children from predators."</TE>
<TE>   Allred said she will advise the Van Dams about the possibility of
a lawsuit against Westerfield, who lived two doors away from the Van
Dams in the upscale Sabre Springs neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle was abducted from her bedroom Feb. 1. Her nude and
decomposing body was found four weeks later in a rural area, a week
after Westerfield had been arrested on the strength of blood, fiber
and fingerprint evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield did not testify during the high-profile trial, and
prosecutors never pinpointed when or where they thought Westerfield
killed Danielle.</TE>
<TE>   In a motion, Feldman argued that if Danielle were killed in her
bedroom, Westerfield would not be guilty of kidnapping. Murder
committed during a kidnapping is considered a special circumstance
that can bring the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   But Mudd noted that even if she were killed in her bedroom,
Westerfield would be guilty of murdering her during a residential
burglary, also considered a special circumstance.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek mocked the bedroom theory. "It's
almost as likely she was killed in the parlor with the candlestick by
Col. Mustard," Dusek said, a reference to the board game Clue.</TE>

<LD>   Akram Taufiq Muramy is suspected of planning a suicide bombing
attack against President Hamid Karzai or Defense Minister Mohammad
Qassim Fahim, according to a government statement. Afghan
intelligence services arrested him on a street corner in the Wazir
Akbar Khan district, where many foreigners live and work.</LD>
<LD>   The statement did not specify the group to which Muramy allegedly
belonged, but the Afghan government routinely uses the phrase
"international terror group" in describing Al Qaeda.</LD>
<TE>   Karzai was the target of a Sept. 5 assassination attempt,
prompting him to replace his Afghan bodyguards with U.S. troops.</TE>

<HD>Bali Blast Suspect Says He Chose Sites</HD>
<DH>First explosion was apparently carried out by a suicide
bomber, Indonesia police say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>The suspected ringleader of last month's deadly Bali bombing
confessed Friday that he personally selected two crowded nightclubs
as his targets to further the cause of Islamic holy war, police
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Terrorism suspect Imam Samudra, who was arrested Thursday trying
to flee the island of Java, also told police that the first of three
blasts to hit Bali within seconds of each other Oct. 12 was a suicide
bomb carried in a backpack by a Muslim "martyr."</LD>
<LD>   If true, it would signal the arrival in Indonesia of a tactic
widely used by Muslim militants in the Middle East but not here,
where security is generally less strict and such extreme measures
aren't taken. Investigators had concluded that the first bomb, which
went off in Paddy's pub, killing eight people, was detonated by cell
phone seconds before a car bomb exploded across the street, killing
183.</LD>
<TE>   National Police Chief Dai Bachtiar, who met with Samudra, said the
suspect also confessed that he had participated in at least four
previous bombings in Indonesia, including attacks on churches and a
shopping mall here in the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Samudra, 35, told police that he was motivated by his belief that
Muslims are treated unfairly by the non-Islamic world.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a stern person, and he looks like a person who sticks to
his principles," said Erwin Mappaseng, the national chief of
detectives. "He is not afraid to die. He is different from a
criminal. A criminal who was arrested would be scared. But not him."</TE>
<TE>   In the town of Cilegong, where Samudra was being held, police
briefly brought him outdoors for television cameras but hustled him
back inside when he and several supporters began shouting, "Allahu
akbar!" Arabic for "God is great!"</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a blue "Converse Original" T-shirt, Samudra appeared
determined and intense. His forehead bore a mark made by repeatedly
pressing his head on the floor while praying, a blemish considered by
some to be a sign of devotion.</TE>
<TE>   Samudra is believed to be an important figure in Jemaah Islamiah,
a regional terrorist network linked with Al Qaeda. His arrest, less
than six weeks after the Bali attack, was a big break for police.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia has been plagued by numerous unsolved bombings during
the last two years. Now authorities are beginning to perceive that
Jemaah Islamiah has been behind dozens of terrorist attacks aimed at
killing Christians and destabilizing this largely Islamic country.</TE>
<TE>   As authorities pursue at least five more suspects in the Bali
bombing, there are continued warnings of future attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Three international schools in Jakarta have been closed for more
than a week because of what Western intelligence analysts believe are
"specific" and "credible" threats.</TE>
<TE>   Police Gen. I Made Mangku Pastika, who heads the Bali bombing
investigation, said police are looking into whether Samudra set any
new attacks in motion before his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "Police now are still investigating him and trying to reveal [any]
broader network, because there are indications Samudra has a new
plan," Pastika told reporters in Bali.</TE>
<TE>   Samudra might be able to provide investigators with information
about the workings of Jemaah Islamiah and its alleged leaders,
radical clerics Abu Bakar Bashir and Riduan Isamuddin, better known
as Hambali. Bashir is under arrest; Hambali is on the run.</TE>
<TE>   Based on Samudra's statement, police said they would reexamine the
bombing at Paddy's to see if there was evidence of its being a
suicide attack. Samudra said the bomber was a man named Iqbal who
detonated the bomb as he walked into the club.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they would compare DNA from Iqbal's relatives with
corpses found in the bar.</TE>
<TE>   Samudra told police that he had spent more than two years in
Afghanistan, where he fought against Soviet forces and learned to use
weapons. He later moved to Malaysia and spent more than six years
there.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Indonesia in 2000 determined to carry out jihad, or
holy war. Police said he admitted taking part in at least one in a
series of church bombings on Christmas Eve that year that killed 19
people in 10 cities.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, he told police, he helped bomb two churches and
arranged for what turned out to be the bungled bombing of the Atrium
Mall in Jakarta, in which one of the bombers blew off his leg.</TE>
<TE>   About a month before the Bali bombing, according to his
confession, Samudra ordered two of his henchmen to rob a jewelry
store to raise funds. They got away with more than $40,000. Both men
were arrested this week and helped point out Samudra to police as he
boarded a ferry bound for Sumatra.</TE>
<TE>   Samudra told police that 12 people were involved in the Bali
bombings. He knew Amrozi, the man who was arrested two weeks ago for
buying the car and explosives used in the attack, from his years in
Malaysia.</TE>

<HD>Putin Prods Bush on Terror</HD>
<DH>The two presidents have a 'very, very frank' discussion.
The Russian leader addresses many fronts in the war and asks, 'Where
has Osama bin Laden taken refuge?'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Russia</DL>
<LD>President Vladimir V. Putin bluntly cautioned President Bush on
Friday to stay focused on all fronts in the war on terrorism even as
the international drive to disarm Iraq moves toward a climax.</LD>
<LD>   "Now, where has Osama bin Laden taken refuge?" Putin asked
pointedly during a brief news conference with Bush, who had come here
to personally reassure the Russian president on NATO's intentions a
day after the alliance approved a milestone expansion.</LD>
<LD>   Whether he meant to or not, the Russian president raised an issue
that is sensitive with the White House. Increasingly, Democrats in
Washington are posing that very question as a way to raise doubts
about the progress of the U.S.-declared war on terror and to suggest
that Bush may be taking on too ambitious an agenda by going after
Baghdad as well.</LD>
<TE>   Since Bush first declared his desire to capture Bin Laden "dead or
alive" shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he has backed
away from that imperative as the Al Qaeda leader remained at large,
explaining that the war is about more than any one person.</TE>
<TE>   Although Putin and Bush joined Friday in demanding that Iraq
comply with the recent U.N. resolution to disarm, the two leaders
engaged in what they called a candid 90-minute meeting in which they
aired their differences on issues from Iraq to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian leader also suggested that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan
abet or sponsor terrorists and therefore must be pressured into
changing their ways.</TE>
<TE>   He further cautioned Bush to remain within the parameters of the
U.N. mandate in leading any international coalition to force Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to get rid of his suspected weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether Bush was taken off guard by Putin's remarks
at the news conference. But Bush did not respond. Rather, he declared
an end to the news conference, saying, "We've got a plane to catch."</TE>
<TE>   White House officials initially declined to discuss Putin's
concerns. But hours later, a senior Bush administration official told
reporters, in a dismissive tone, that the Russian president "has
expressed those kinds of concerns for a while, and he's talking about
a broader problem. And that's his view and not ours."</TE>
<TE>   Bush arrived here Friday afternoon for his seventh meeting with
Putin triumphant after a historic NATO summit in Prague, Czech
Republic, that voted to expand the alliance's membership from 19 to
26 -- including the three Baltic states, which once were a part of
the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Bush decided to make a special trip to Russia so that he could
tell Putin and the Russian people that they have nothing to fear from
NATO's expansion, saying democracy and stability along its western
border will be good for Russia as well.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush put it, "Russia is our friend; we've got a lot of
interests together."</TE>
<TE>   But it was Iraq that dominated the meeting. Before the men had
even sat down for their talks at Catherine Palace outside St.
Petersburg, they issued a statement calling on Iraq to "cooperate
fully and unconditionally" with the U.N. resolution -- "or face
serious consequences." On Thursday, all 19 NATO leaders voted to
support the resolution and vowed to take "effective action" to help
the U.N. enforce its mandate to disarm Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But a number of differences apparently arose during the Bush-Putin
tete-a-tete. And both presidents alluded to them in their public
remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Putin characterized the talks as "very, very frank." Bush, calling
the Russian president by his first name, added: "Like other good
friends I've had throughout my life, we don't agree 100% of the time.
But we always agree to discuss things in a frank and -- in a frank
way."</TE>
<TE>   Putin said he and Bush discussed "practically everything between
the sky and the Earth," and then he took pains to tell reporters that
he had specifically raised the roles of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in
the context of the terror war.</TE>
<TE>   "We should not give a chance to anyone who is either engaged in
terror or who is supporting terror," Putin said.</TE>
<TE>   "We should not forget about those who finance terrorism," he
added. "Of the 19 terrorists who committed the main attacks on Sept.
11 against the United States, 16 are citizens of Saudi Arabia. And we
should not forget about that." Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were from
Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush looked on, Putin then raised the issue of Bin Laden's
whereabouts, saying, "They say that [he is] somewhere between
Afghanistan and Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   Although he expressed support for Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf's efforts to "achieve stability in his country," Putin
added: "But what can happen with armies armed with weapons that exist
in Pakistan, including weapons of mass destruction? We are not sure
on that aspect. And we should not forget about that."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf had supported Afghanistan's Taliban regime, which
allowed Al Qaeda to thrive there. But after the Sept. 11 attacks,
Pakistan severed its ties to the regime under U.S. pressure, and the
U.S. soon routed the Taliban from Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   In their meeting, Bush reiterated his desire for a peaceful
disarmament of Iraq but also his determination to do so by force if
necessary, said National Security Council spokesman Sean McCormack.</TE>
<TE>   Putin agreed with that goal, but he further expressed his belief
that by staying "within the [U.N.] framework ... together with the
United States we can achieve a positive result."</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Putin also continued to disagree about NATO expansion,
although the Russian president has come to grudgingly accept the
inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Putin once viewed the expansion of the alliance, which was created
as a defense against the Soviet Union, with great wariness and
considered such a move not only an insult but also a military
provocation.</TE>
<TE>   "You know our position well," Putin said. Still, he expressed the
hope of fostering "positive development of our relations with all
NATO countries."</TE>
<TE>   Their disagreements notwithstanding, the Bush-Putin meeting
underscored anew the personal affinity that has taken root between
the leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks ago, Bush called Putin to discuss the impending U.N.
Security Council vote on the new Iraq resolution. During that
conversation, Putin invited Bush to add Russia to his trip to the
NATO summit.</TE>
<TE>   Bush instantly accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has also spontaneously extended his hospitality to Putin.
During their first meeting, in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on June 16, 2001,
Bush made a spur-of-the-moment invitation to Putin to visit his Texas
ranch.</TE>

<HD>British Firefighters Begin an Eight-Day Strike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>British firefighters began an eight-day strike Friday, blaming the
government for wrecking a last-minute pay deal and leaving the armed
forces to provide emergency cover.</LD>
<LD>   Returning from a NATO summit, Prime Minister Tony Blair flew into
a political storm but said he was ready for a fight with a service he
accuses of living in the past.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters had been pressing for a 40% pay raise but early
Friday were set to agree to an employers' offer of a 16% package,
when ministers scotched the proposal at the last minute.</LD>
<TE>   "When a real chance of peace was possible, the government has
intervened to block that offer," said Fire Brigades Union leader Andy
Gilchrist.</TE>
<TE>   Military chiefs already have warned that their forces are
stretched to the limit at a time when contingency planning is
underway for a possible offensive in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The strike also comes as the government has put Britain on
heightened alert for possible terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   About 19,000 army, navy and air force personnel -- a tenth of
British forces -- have been drafted to cover for the firefighters,
using outdated "green goddess" fire engines up to 50 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Ten people died in blazes or on the roads during the first
firefighter strike, although none of the deaths was attributed to the
two-day stoppage last week.</TE>
<TE>   The firefighters' walkout prompted fears of a long winter of
industrial unrest.</TE>
<TE>   Last-ditch talks are underway to stop a strike by key workers at
seven of Britain's major airports, which could ground planes across
the country next week. Others, from subway workers to teachers, have
taken or are considering strike action.</TE>
<TE>   Some in government are said to want a showdown to prove that Blair
is not under the unions' thumb.</TE>
<TE>   "If people think the government and the country can be held to
ransom through strike action, can be bounced with half-baked
proposals in the middle of the night ... then they are not living in
the real world," the Labor Party prime minister's official spokesman
told reporters.</TE>

<HD>Kuwaiti Policeman Is Arrested in Attack on American
Soldiers</HD>
<DH>Authorities say the suspect has a history of mental
problems. Incident underscores dangers facing U.S. troops in the
region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KUWAIT CITY</DL>
<LD>A Kuwaiti police officer said to have a history of mental problems
was arrested in Saudi Arabia on Friday, a day after he allegedly shot
two American soldiers and fled, a Kuwaiti official said.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, Khaled Shimmiri, was picked up in eastern Saudi
Arabia near the border, the state-run Kuwait News Agency reported. He
was expected to be extradited to Kuwait, the agency said.</LD>
<LD>   Shimmiri had been a patient at a Kuwait psychiatric hospital, an
Interior Ministry official said. It was not known whether he was
still receiving treatment.</LD>
<TE>   While Kuwait has sought to the portray the incident as the work of
a single unbalanced man, the shooting came amid increasing fears that
anti-Americanism is growing in this Persian Gulf state, long an
American ally.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second shooting of U.S. troops here in the last six
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have offered no explanation for the latest attack, and
Kuwaiti news reports said Shimmiri was not known to have any ties to
extremist Muslim groups.</TE>
<TE>   The two soldiers, wearing civilian garb, were shot as they drove
along a desert highway Thursday. The shooting has raised concerns
about the safety of the more than 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in
Kuwait. Most people here support the U.S. military presence following
the 1991 Gulf War, in which U.S.-led forces drove out occupying Iraqi
troops.</TE>
<TE>   The number of U.S. troops here has increased in recent months, as
Kuwait would be a key staging ground for any attack on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have not released the soldiers' names, but Lt. Col.
Paul Gautreaux of the 336th Finance Command in Louisiana confirmed
that two of its soldiers were shot in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Master Sgt. Larry Thomas, 51, who was shot in the upper chest, was
in serious but stable condition after surgery, his wife, Geraldine,
said in Lake Charles, La.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas, who works as a mail carrier and who oversees the payroll
department in the command, was deployed to Kuwait over the summer,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The other soldier was identified by relatives as Sgt. Charles
Ellis, also of Lake Charles. His wife, Melanie, told a television
station that army officials had notified her of the shooting.</TE>

<HD>British U.N. Aid Worker Killed in W. Bank</HD>
<DH>The senior relief agency official is fatally shot during a
battle in Jenin refugee camp between Palestinian militants and
Israeli troops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alissa J. Rubin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A United Nations relief official working at a refugee camp in the
West Bank was shot to death Friday during a pitched gun battle
between Israeli forces and armed Palestinians, the first foreign U.N.
aid worker to be killed in two years of fighting.</LD>
<LD>   It was unclear whose bullet killed Iain Hook of Britain, a senior
manager for the U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees. Just
minutes before he was shot, Hook, who was in his early 50s, was on
the telephone with the agency's Jerusalem office trying to arrange a
safe exit from the area for his staff.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman at the United Nations in New York said
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was saddened by Hook's death and "very
disturbed by the fact that the Israel Defense Forces refused
immediate access for an ambulance" at the U.N. compound in the Jenin
refugee camp.</LD>
<TE>   The Israeli army said Hook was evacuated as quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Also killed Friday in the camp was a 12-year-old Palestinian boy
who was shot by Israeli forces. In the Gaza Strip, an Israeli soldier
died under sniper fire and a Palestinian was killed as he tried to
enter an Israeli settlement, according to the Israel Defense Forces.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops began a major deployment throughout the Palestinian
territories early Friday in response to a suicide bus bombing in
Jerusalem on Thursday that killed 11 people and injured dozens.</TE>
<TE>   The West Bank city of Bethlehem, the area from which the bomber
came, was reoccupied, with 22 people arrested and the home of at
least one suspected militant demolished, according to an Israel
Defense Forces spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently worried about the situation's volatility, U.S.
diplomats asked the Israelis to withdraw from Bethlehem as soon as
possible. The city was the site this year of a 39-day siege at the
Church of the Nativity in Manger Square.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Jenin, Israeli troops Friday entered the West Bank cities
of Tulkarm and Nablus as well as the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   In Jenin, tanks and armored vehicles surrounded the home of
Abdullah Wahsh, a suspected member of the Islamic Jihad militant
group. It was during the ensuing gunfight that several stray bullets
hit the U.N. compound, fatally wounding Hook.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military said it was investigating Hook's death.
Palestinians claimed he was felled by Israeli bullets.</TE>
<TE>   "The latest attack shows how extremist the current Israeli
government is," said Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, a physician and political
activist. "They are willing to kill not only Palestinians ... but
also members of the international community who are here trying to
help the Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli military spokesman, however, said, "Because the
terrorists act inside urban areas where there are civilians, women
and children, they draw the IDF to fight in urban areas and endanger
the lives of civilians there."</TE>
<TE>   Hook directed the U.N. Relief and Works Agency's project to
rebuild the Jenin refugee camp, which was devastated by Israeli army
operations last spring. He had started the job less than two months
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He was extremely energetic, full of ideas and plans," said Sami
Mshasha, the agency's spokesman. "It's very unfortunate, very sad. It
underlines the difficulties of working in this area."</TE>
<TE>   Despite continuing violence in the last two weeks, a poll released
Friday in the daily newspaper Yediot Aharonot suggested that 60% of
Israelis and about half the Likud Party of Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon support the formation of a Palestinian state after peace
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   More surprising, the poll found that a substantial majority of
Likud members, 65%, support the evacuation of at least some of the
controversial Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   The poll also found that Sharon commanded a strong lead over
Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the race to lead the Likud
Party. A primary election between the men will be held Thursday, and
a general election Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu says he would take a tougher line against the
Palestinians, including the expulsion of Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Any talk of negotiation with the Palestinians was beyond the
Israelis living in the working-class neighborhood of Ir Ganim in
southern Jerusalem, where the suicide bomber's detonation on a
crowded commuter bus claimed 11 lives, including those of four
children, Thursday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Many neighbors of the victims attended their funerals, then
gathered at the hairdresser, at the local community center and in
small shops to talk.</TE>
<TE>   "If they have reached here, my home, then they can strike
anywhere. Nothing is safe anymore," said Rivka Shitrit, 48, an
assistant kindergarten teacher, who was getting her hair done at a
small salon. "It didn't used to be like this. This wasn't how I grew
up."</TE>
<TE>   For Alice Benaim, 61, a part-time manicurist, the bombing hit
close to home: Her sister would have been on that bus, but on
Thursday she stopped to take out the garbage first.</TE>
<TE>   "It was her luck that she did that -- she even ran to the stop and
knocked on the bus door, but the driver wouldn't open it," Benaim
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of such attacks there is only one solution, the women
said: all-out war. "We're not living a normal life like other
countries, which had one or two terror attacks," said Sima Perry,
another woman who was at the hairdresser's.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't take any more of these terror attacks."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>NATO leaders closed a two-day summit Friday by meeting with the heads
of partner nations to discuss deeper cooperation, particularly in the
Western alliance's newly declared mission of combating global
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The gathering was marred by diplomatic rows linked to Western
pressure on two partner nations. Belarussian President Alexander G.
Lukashenko was blocked from coming because of human rights issues.
Ukrainian President Leonid D. Kuchma, caught up in a dispute over
weapons sales, arrived as an unwelcome guest.</LD>
<LD>   Still, NATO Secretary-General George Robertson described the
Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council as "a transatlantic family working
together for peace" and said its leaders Friday "reaffirmed the
resolve of their states to fight the scourge of terrorism." The
council matches the 19 North Atlantic Treaty Organization member
nations with 27 countries stretching from Ireland to many of the
economically and politically troubled states of the former Soviet
Union.</LD>
<TE>   "I see the partnership becoming ever more relevant, especially as
you go further east and into ... Central Asia, where these countries
are not going to join NATO in the immediate future but where their
needs are great and where the potential for trouble is enormous,"
Robertson said at a summit-closing news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of the partnership, as we see it, is to promote
freedom and democracy and to strengthen the security and stability of
the Euro-Atlantic area," President Bush said before leaving to meet
with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin in St. Petersburg.</TE>
<TE>   The NATO-Russia Council, a consultative body set up in May, met
Friday at the foreign minister level. After those talks, Russian
Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov welcomed NATO's assurances that its
expansion -- marked by membership invitations issued Thursday to
seven states formerly part of the communist East -- is not aimed
against his country.</TE>
<TE>   Russia and NATO will increasingly work together, as long as the
alliance focuses on "opposing new threats and challenges of this
contemporary world -- the same challenges Russia is trying to counter
today," Ivanov said.</TE>
<TE>   The Baltic nations of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, plus
Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia received invitations
Thursday to join the alliance in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Czech Republic authorities, in line with broader Western policy
designed to pressure Belarus' Lukashenko to adopt a more democratic
stance in his nation, refused to grant a visa for him to attend the
partnership meeting.</TE>
<TE>   That prompted a blistering speech here Friday by the Belarussian
ambassador to NATO, Sergei Martynov. He blasted the Czech decision as
an "ignominious act" and attacked the alliance for "hypocrisy, double
standards, explicit arbitrariness and primitive blackmail."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson, at his news conference, noted that Martynov's speech
"was a pretty angry message," then deftly sought to turn it back
against Lukashenko as a lesson in democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the ambassador that we listened to him," Robertson said,
"and people had done so with respect, and that he should report back
to his president that the message was given, and a lengthy statement
was distributed, because we believe in free speech and in the right
of contrary views to be heard, however uncomfortable they may be.
That is what we stand for."</TE>
<TE>   The very end of the news conference was disrupted when two young
men threw tomatoes at Robertson -- which he calmly dodged -- and
shouted in Russian that "NATO is worse than the Gestapo." As security
officers took the men away, they said they were from the National
Bolshevik Party of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Ukrainian President Kuchma was asked not to come to Prague because
of accusations he had approved sale of an advanced radar system to
Iraq in defiance of U.N. resolutions. He showed up anyway but got a
cold shoulder from nearly all the other leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma has strongly denied the allegations, but U.S. officials
said in September that they had authenticated a tape in which the
Ukrainian leader allegedly is heard approving the sale. Western
officials fear that the radar system could enable the Iraqis to
target U.S. and British warplanes in any conflict or as they enforce
the "no-fly" zones in northern and southern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   At NATO summits, heads of state and government usually are seated
alphabetically according to the English names of their countries. But
to spare Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair the diplomatic
discomfort of sitting near Kuchma, seating Friday was arranged
alphabetically in French, the alliance's second official language.</TE>
<TE>   A meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission was held at the foreign
minister level so that heads of state and government would not need
to interact with Kuchma.</TE>
<TE>   After that meeting, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko told
reporters that his country would continue to pursue NATO membership.
"Our partnership, despite all the problems, has good" prospects, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Zlenko said his government wanted to cooperate with Britain and
the United States to disprove their "groundless accusations" of
Kuchma's involvement in the sale. However, Ukraine cannot provide a
full accounting on all bilateral arms sales because in some cases
they involve privileged information, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The tensions with Belarus and Ukraine failed to disrupt the
overall mood of partner nations seeking closer ties with NATO.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson said he felt "very heartened by how virtually all of the
Caucasus and Central Asia presidents were here with us today."</TE>

<HD>Nigerian Spotlight Shifts From Beauty to Ugliness</HD>
<DH>Miss World contest is moved to London after deadly
religious riots dash a dream.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Davan Maharaj</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAGOS, Nigeria</DL>
<LD>The Miss World beauty pageant was supposed to put this country, which
its own Nobel laureate, Wole Soyinka, has called the "open sore" of
the African continent, on the tourism map.</LD>
<LD>   "We are overjoyed that these angels are in our midst," Fatima
Garbati, who heads a trade group of Nigerian tour operators, said
when the contestants arrived this month. "They are going to show the
world that Nigeria is safe for tourists and investments."</LD>
<LD>   That wasn't to be. Instead of showcasing a welcoming environment,
the pageant sparked riots between Muslim and Christian mobs that have
left at least 105 people dead and closeted the beauty queens in their
hotels under the watchful eye of the police and the army.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, the contest's organizers pulled the plug on Nigeria.</TE>
<TE>   "Organizers of the 2002 Miss World pageant have decided to move
the grand finale to London, England," the organizers said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision was taken after careful consideration of all the
issues involved and in the overall interests of Nigeria and the
contestants participating in this year's edition," it said. The
decision came even though organizers insisted earlier in the day that
the show would go on in Nigeria despite three days of rioting.</TE>
<TE>   There was no indication whether the move would bring a halt to the
violence. The clashes, which have seriously injured more than 500
people, erupted Wednesday in the northern city of Kaduna. On Thursday
night, authorities reported that the violence had spread to the
capital, Abuja, where the pageant was to be held Dec. 7. Thousands of
Muslim youths armed with knives and machetes looted stores, attacked
motorists and caused a stampede less than a mile from where the
contestants are lodged.</TE>
<TE>   "Nigeria is tearing itself up again," said Lucy Uche, a bank
teller in Lagos, the country's commercial capital. "This was bound to
happen. All we needed was a match."</TE>
<TE>   That match was struck by Isioma Daniel, a columnist with ThisDay,
an independent daily newspaper based in Lagos.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing Muslim leaders who say it is immoral to waste money and
attention on skimpily dressed beauty queens, Daniel asked, "What
would Muhammad think?"</TE>
<TE>   "In all honesty, he would have probably chosen a wife from one of
them."</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper published a lengthy front-page apology Thursday,
saying the portrayal of Islam's prophet was "not only unjustified but
utterly provocative." A day earlier, angry Muslim youths torched
ThisDay's Kaduna office.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, rampaging Muslim mobs set ablaze churches and houses
belonging to Christians in Kaduna. In ensuing clashes, Christian and
Muslim mobs stoned each other with rocks and bottles and hacked each
other with knives and machetes. Several bystanders were set on fire
-- and burned to death.</TE>
<TE>   A witness reported Friday that 12 charred bodies were still lying
in downtown Kaduna, where a 24-hour shoot-on-sight curfew was being
enforced by heavily armed security forces.</TE>
<TE>   The Miss World pageant has exposed Nigeria's fragile religious
sensitivities. In the last few years, many northern states have
embraced Islamic law, sparking tensions with their Christian
residents and the predominantly Christian south. Two years ago, more
than 2,000 people died in ethnic and religious clashes in Kaduna
state.</TE>
<TE>   The religious divide in Nigeria received international attention
recently when an Islamic court ordered that Amina Lawal, 31, of
Katsina state be stoned to death for having a child out of wedlock.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of contestants -- from Panama, Denmark, Costa Rica,
Switzerland and South Africa -- answered calls to boycott the event
in the wake of the sentencing, but the Nigerian government has
assured the contestants that no stoning will be carried out.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, officials trotted out Lawal, who pleaded for the
contestants not to boycott the pageant.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. contestant, "Miss Stars &amp; Stripes'' Rebekah Revels, did
not boycott the pageant and arrived in Nigeria last week. Earlier
this year, Revels made news in the Miss America contest when she
filed a lawsuit against the North Carolina state pageant seeking to
regain the title she gave up after an ex-boyfriend said he had
topless photos of her. On Friday, television stations in Nigeria
juxtaposed coverage of the riots with previously taken pictures of
the beauty queens sipping drinks, watching a yachting regatta and
being entertained by cultural troupes.</TE>
<TE>   Activists say the millions of dollars that the government poured
into the pageant could have been used to repair collapsing roads and
bridges or provide other services for the 70% of the country's 129
million people who earn less than a dollar a day.</TE>
<TE>   Critics note that the contestants were conspicuously kept away
from Lagos, which is bedeviled by extreme congestion, massive poverty
and soaring crime.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the controversy surrounding the pageant, many Nigerians
say they hope to keep the crown that 20-year-old local beauty Agbani
Darego won in South Africa last year.</TE>
<TE>   Under an overpass in the crowded Ikeja neighborhood of Lagos,
Shola Oluyemi and several friends were discussing the pageant while
waiting four hours for their hair to be braided with synthetic fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Oluyemi, a 21-year-old student at Lagos State University, said she
hopes this year's Nigerian contestant, Chineye Ochuba, wins even
though the competition isn't about "natural beauty."</TE>
<TE>   "These girls who are here are artificial beauties," she said,
punching the air for emphasis. "They're too skinny and they wear too
much makeup. If they want to see real beauties, they've come to the
right place -- Nigeria."</TE>
<TE>   In Kaduna, Red Cross workers were picking up bodies and treating
the injured. Hundreds of people were unable to reach their homes as
the curfew was being tightly enforced.</TE>
<TE>   Relief officials were preparing for more violence.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot rule out the spread of this crisis to other parts of
the north," said Patrick Bawa, a Red Cross spokesman.</TE>

<HD>How Hussein Gets 'Anything He Wants'</HD>
<DH>Iraq uses elaborate schemes to smuggle in contraband and
defeat U.N. sanctions. It's a high-stakes game of cat and mouse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Drogin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Late one afternoon in March 2001, busy border guards in Jordan gave a
cursory check to a sheaf of export documents, then waved past three
large trucks hauling hundreds of rolls of brightly colored cloth into
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Hidden inside the trucks was a bonanza of banned military materiel
-- including night-vision devices, global positioning systems,
communications gear and other highly specialized electronic equipment
from South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   An Iraqi smuggler had bought counterfeit export approval papers
for $5,000 from officials in Amman, the Jordanian capital. That, plus
a forged signature and a bogus blue stamp, was all it took to shatter
strict United Nations sanctions against President Saddam Hussein's
regime.</LD>
<TE>   "I buy the permission," said the smuggler, a slim, 39-year-old
Baghdad-born engineer who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The
permission says only fabric. It is supposed to be permission from the
U.N. So the guard says: 'OK, no problem. Just go.' "</TE>
<TE>   In all, the engineer said, he helped sneak at least 25 loads of
contraband cargo into Iraq for hefty commissions. Among them: 2,500
tires for armored personnel carriers from Ukraine, two trucks of
high-tech laboratory equipment from Germany, and mainframe South
Korean computers inside empty refrigerator boxes from Dubai, United
Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam, anything he wants, he can get," said the Iraqi, who
recently moved to Britain. "Especially now. He will pay anything."</TE>
<TE>   The smuggler's story, and others like it, are familiar and
frustrating to U.S., European and U.N. officials who have sought to
unravel the illegal procurement network Baghdad has used since U.N.
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Those sanctions-busting schemes are back in the spotlight as U.N.
inspection teams return to Iraq and as Washington girds for war. At
issue: determining what Hussein may have done to make poison gases,
produce deadly microbes for germ warfare, develop atomic bombs and
build long-range ballistic missiles to deliver them all.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be easy. Hussein has relied on a global maze of front
companies and offshore banks, shady arms merchants and factory
owners, crooked middlemen and brokers, plus corrupt officials and
border guards. Only a fraction of goods are checked at border posts.
And only a handful of people have been caught or prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of smuggling, the U.N. inspectors will not be armed with
lots of new documents showing this or that has entered the country,"
said Mustafa Alani, an Iraq expert at London's Royal United Services
Institute for Defense Studies, which is affiliated with Britain's
Defense Ministry. "There is almost no hard evidence. There are mostly
assumptions."</TE>
<TE>   In part, that's because almost all the components and raw
materials needed to produce chemical and biological weapons and
ballistic missiles are known as dual-use, meaning they also have
legitimate uses in Iraq's petrochemical industry, hospitals,
pesticide plants or other civilian facilities.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Must OK Goods</TE>
<TE>   Under sanctions, U.N. officials are supposed to approve all goods,
including any dual-use equipment, that Iraq seeks to import.
Inspectors have identified more than 100 suspect contracts since
December 1999 and now are checking a backlog of additional dual-use
documents that Iraq handed over Oct. 1 in Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no specific equipment for producing chemical warfare
agents," explained a member of the current U.N. weapons inspection
team. "It's all dual-use equipment."</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, legitimate suppliers are unaware of the agents'
agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "I found a European company trying to sell high-speed pumps to
Iraq," said a Western government official who plays a lead role in
tracking and intercepting clandestine shipments. "Perfectly innocent.
But the pump is perfect for missiles. We had to tell them."</TE>
<TE>   Uncertainty also stems from Hussein's reorganization of his covert
procurement network after U.N. inspectors last searched Iraqi
factories, laboratories and offices for incriminating evidence in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   The state-run Military Industrialization Commission was put in
charge of the revamped effort. Commission agents, often traveling on
phony passports, have been tracked from Congo and Kenya to Malaysia
and Indonesia, from China and Thailand to Austria and Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq tracks them as well. In July, the official Iraqi press
reported that 10 engineers at Bader Enterprise, a missile-parts plant
run by the commission, had been arrested after returning from
delegation visits to India, Russia and Ukraine. The engineers were
said to face execution for allegedly passing information to foreign
governments.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi intelligence agents accompany all such overseas visits. In
the 1990s, an Iraqi intelligence unit known as M-19 also was used to
create shell companies for especially sensitive deals.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically M-19 sets up a front in Amman, then sets up a parallel
Jordanian company run by Palestinians," said Scott Ritter, a former
U.N. weapons inspector who investigated several such deals. "They set
up an affiliate in Switzerland and then another in France. Then
they'll open another in Malaysia or in Singapore, who will buy what
Saddam wants in Taiwan. No one notices when a Singapore company buys
machine tools in Taiwan, and the billing goes to Geneva and the end
user is in Jordan. Except it then gets trucked into Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the system is similar today, although Syria and
Dubai have largely replaced Jordan, and companies increasingly are
registered in Lichtenstein, Cyprus and Panama. The labyrinth of
corporate "cutouts," usually run by individuals whose identities
can't be traced, helps shield every operation involving weapons of
mass destruction, or WMD.</TE>
<TE>   "One company will be for transport, one to pay the bills, one to
deal with suppliers of WMD materials, one to deal with suppliers of a
legitimate product like food or medicine," said the Western
government official. "The classic front company is one man, one fax,
one transaction."</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, Western authorities have let Hussein's nameplate
companies remain open so they could eavesdrop to gather intelligence.
One result: Electronic tracking or surveillance devices have been
inserted into several shipments of goods smuggled into Iraq to see
where they wound up, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Carrying a Shopping List</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi agents have been known to carry 30-page shopping lists of
prohibited equipment. They usually pay in cash and buy in bulk. The
military industrial commission usually remits the money through the
nearest Iraqi ambassador or military attache.</TE>
<TE>   "They are forbidden from even negotiating," said Nabil Musawi, who
has interviewed several smugglers for the Iraqi National Congress, an
opposition group based in London. "They are told: 'Just get the
items. Whatever it costs.' "</TE>
<TE>   The known sums are relatively small. Between 1994 and 1998, U.N.
inspectors uncovered or intercepted transactions worth $50 million to
$60 million for components, raw materials, high-tech spare parts and
other equipment that could be used for weapons of mass destruction.
Shipments or deals were traced to about 20 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Most involved Iraq's efforts to produce chemical weapons or to
acquire liquid propellant chemicals and solid propellant rocket motor
ingredients for long-range ballistic missiles. Few of the confirmed
deals involved germ warfare agents, and none involved material for
nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   But only a handful of suspected smuggling cases for weapons of
mass destruction have come to light since inspectors left in 1998.
Even fewer are known to have succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and British officials, for example, say Iraq has made a
concerted effort to procure materials that could be used to construct
gas centrifuges to enrich uranium, a step toward forming fuel for
nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   As evidence, a British Joint Intelligence Committee report in
September revealed that Baghdad had "sought significant quantities"
of uranium from Africa even though Iraq has no nuclear power plants.</TE>
<TE>   Although Iraqi agents visited many of the 13 African countries
where uranium is mined, no evidence indicates they succeeded in
obtaining uranium, intelligence officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The British report also said Iraq made "attempts to purchase"
vacuum pumps, special magnets, a large filament winding machine and
other specialized equipment "which could be used" to build gas
centrifuges. Iraq also "made repeated attempts" to acquire 60,000 or
more specialized aluminum tubes, the report noted, "although there is
no definitive intelligence that it is destined for a nuclear
program."</TE>
<TE>   Officials won't say why the attempts went awry. But most
nuclear-related materials are subject to international export
controls, so they are easier to track and intercept.</TE>
<TE>   Even nonnuclear deals often fail. In the 1990s, U.N. inspectors
found that three out of four of the suspected weapons-smuggling
schemes they investigated had not resulted in delivery of prohibited
goods.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, suppliers backed out. In others, Iraq didn't
approve the deal, or someone in the system got cold feet. One reason:
Not everyone in the illegal trade is a volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   "People who have successful businesses, [the regime] sends someone
who says 'the master' -- they call Saddam 'the master' -- wishes to
be your partner," said Hamid Bayati, another Iraqi exile here in
London. "He says OK or he disappears."</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad got scammed at least once, buying guidance units from
dismantled Ukrainian missiles in the mid-1990s that didn't fit Iraqi
missiles. "They got them, smuggled them inside, and U.N. inspectors
finally got wind," said former inspector David Kay. "Divers found
them dumped in the Tigris River."</TE>
<TE>   Other deals may be fakes. A CIA official warns that many Iraqi
defectors concoct or inflate smuggling stories to win favor in the
West. And both Iraqi and Western intelligence agencies have sought to
trick one another in what one official called a "covert struggle."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's agents, for example, deliberately have laid false
trails, such as seeking multiple bids to set Western spy services
scrambling. Western operatives, in turn, have tried to "sting" Iraqi
diplomats or traders, seeking to entice or blackmail them into
becoming informants.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. and British send people to Amman and offer the Iraqis
radioactive materials, missile parts, weapons of mass destruction,"
said Alani, the Iraq expert. "They go to someone in the Iraqi
Embassy, or an Iraqi businessman. And he goes back to Baghdad. And
then he comes back and says no. Because it's obviously a trap. But
the report to Washington says Iraq was interested."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Iraq has long experience in buying banned weapons.</TE>
<TE>   During the bitter 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, Baghdad successfully
supplied its troops despite a U.N. arms embargo. The system was never
shut down, and few of the regime's offshore bank accounts were ever
found.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Iraqi smuggling is far more extensive -- and even more
crucial to Hussein's regime.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. sanctions prohibit all imports to or exports from Iraq except
for those approved by the world body. In the largest program, known
as "oil for food," a U.N. agency sells Iraqi crude oil on the world
market and uses the proceeds -- about $10 billion this year -- to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian goods for Iraqi civilians.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. system clearly is porous, however.</TE>
<TE>   According to a CIA report last month, some of the approved goods
have been directly used in weapons programs. More important, the
agency claims, U.N. monitors at Iraq's borders "do not inspect cargo
worth hundreds of millions of dollars" that enters Iraq outside the
oil-for-food program.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these goods clearly support Iraq's military and [weapons
of mass destruction] programs," the CIA said.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA also estimates that Iraq will earn about $3 billion this
year -- more than four times the 1998 amount -- by illegally
exporting oil outside U.N. auspices.</TE>
<TE>   The money "increases Baghdad's capability to finance WMD
programs," the CIA said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say most of the illicit oil money goes to illegally import
a vast array of consumer goods, from Marlboro cigarettes to IBM
computers. Hussein has encouraged such systematic smuggling by
slashing import duties and tariffs since 1996, when the oil-for-food
system began. The results have been dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   "What the sanctions have done is create a rabid free-market
economy," said Toby Dodge, an Iraq expert at the Royal Institute of
International Affairs in London. "It's like structural adjustment
with guns. It's a full-scale alternate economy."</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad also buys banned conventional weapons and supplies on the
global black market. Although Hussein's military force has shrunk
drastically since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, experts say he has been
able to refurbish many aging Soviet-built craft. He also has sought
to upgrade Iraq's antiaircraft systems, a chief concern for U.S. and
British warplanes patrolling "no-fly" zones over northern and
southern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say the chief sources for such sales are arms
companies, organized-crime groups and independent dealers in Eastern
Europe and several former Soviet republics. A Chinese company
provided a fiber-optic communications system.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, authorities have investigated reports that Iraq
obtained a wide range of military equipment from Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Yugoslavia, Belarus and other countries in Eastern Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also have tracked suspected arms deals to groups in
Germany, Russia and Syria, among other places.</TE>
<TE>   At least one operation took place at sea, when a freighter
registered in Cyprus offloaded weapons parts in exchange for Iraqi
oil.</TE>
<TE>   "The sanctions are no more than a strainer," said the Western
government official. "It impedes things. But almost everything
ultimately can go through."</TE>

<HD>Dozens Arrested in Iranian Pro-Reform Protests</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Dozens of people were arrested and several hurt in clashes in three
Iranian cities Friday when the anniversary of a dissident's slaying
added impetus to the largest pro-reform protests in three years.</LD>
<LD>   In Tehran, at least a dozen people, some of them local
journalists, were arrested and several were punched and kicked by
hard-line Islamic militiamen after about 5,000 people started
chanting, "Political prisoners must be freed!" witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   In the northeastern city of Mashhad, 60 people were arrested at a
pro-reform rally, and in the southern city of Shiraz another 25 were
detained, the ISNA student news agency reported.</LD>
<TE>   The demonstrations followed two weeks of almost daily protests by
students demanding free speech and political reform in the Islamic
Republic, where moderate President Mohammad Khatami is locked in a
power struggle with hard-liners who control key levers of power.</TE>
<TE>   The large Tehran gathering in honor of Dariush Forouhar -- a
nationalist stabbed to death at home along with his wife in 1998 by
Intelligence Ministry agents -- was the first reformist rally in the
last two weeks not led by students. It was also the first in that
period to be forcibly broken up by security forces.</TE>
<TE>   Khatami, who has threatened to resign if conservatives keep
blocking his reform agenda, is pushing for legislation giving him
greater authority to run the country of 65 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Iran's hard-liners run the judiciary, armed forces and unelected
state bodies that can veto legislation and election candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-reform demonstrators were vastly outnumbered by the tens
of thousands of faithful at Friday prayers at Tehran University,
where Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said pro-U.S. enemies of
the state were behind the protests.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knows who the enemy is. Today the enemy of the nation
and the government and the system and of our country's independence
and freedom is the arrogant American government," said Khamenei,
Iran's most powerful figure.</TE>
<TE>   At the memorial service for Forouhar at a mosque in southern
Tehran, crowds of people of mixed ages and backgrounds defied police
orders to disperse and began chanting reformist slogans.</TE>
<TE>   Many said they had heeded calls to show up that had been broadcast
by U.S.-based Iranian satellite television stations.</TE>

<HD>Ahmanson Housing Project Clears Hurdle</HD>
<DH>Ventura County planners approve new study, setting up a
vote by supervisors.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The controversial Ahmanson Ranch housing project near Calabasas
narrowly passed another key planning review Friday, setting the stage
for a showdown vote before the Ventura County Board of Supervisors
next month.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County planning commissioners voted 3 to 2 to endorse a
new environmental study of the long-delayed project and allow
construction to begin on homes, offices, a school and golf course.</LD>
<LD>   County supervisors hold final authority on the $2-billion
development, and could vote Dec. 10.</LD>
<TE>   As developer Washington Mutual Bank cheered the planning panel's
decision, critics of the proposed mini-city said the split vote was a
weak endorsement, and that they are confident supervisors will find
the environmental study inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   Planning commissioners Bill Bartels, Daryl Reynolds and Chairman
Michael Wesner endorsed the environmental impact report, which
supplemented a 1992 study after discovery of an endangered frog and
plant on the 2,800-acre property three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual has proposed building 3,050 homes on the rolling
hills abutting Ventura County's border with Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "The developers have a right to develop property that they own,"
and there are sufficient regulations to ensure they do so
responsibly, Reynolds said.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that they will do the right thing," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Dissenting after the two-day hearing, commissioners Leo Molitor
and Selma Dressler said they needed more time to analyze the
4,000-page study and accompanying documents.</TE>
<TE>   They expressed concern about the project's effect on traffic and
the recent discovery of the toxic chemical perchlorate in a well near
the project site.</TE>
<TE>   "I really feel I'm being pushed and rushed to make a decision,"
said Molitor, adding that he felt overburdened by 56 pounds of paper
addressing the development.</TE>
<TE>   Dressler said she wanted even more information, adding, "And the
time to get that information is now -- before we turn the shovel."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the project suspect perchlorate migrated into the
ground water from the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, which is two
miles from the proposed community. Rockets were tested for decades at
the lab.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual has said if the contamination is significant, it
will not tap that ground water to irrigate its golf course.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's five supervisors are set to have their say on the
study at the Dec. 10 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Griffin, spokesman for the Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch
group, urged the board to schedule a series of nighttime hearings
around the county before it votes.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from allowing more residents to comment on the project, such
hearings would most likely delay the supervisors' vote into next year
and achieve a political goal of Washington Mutual's opponents.</TE>
<TE>   In January, project supporter Frank Schillo will leave the board
and opponent Linda Parks will arrive. If the supervisors vote as
their planning appointees did Friday, the new majority would block
the Ahmanson project.</TE>
<TE>   Schillo's appointee on the Planning Commission, Reynolds, made the
motion to approve the new environmental study and send it on.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Seattle-based Washington Mutual praised the
commissioners for their attention during the marathon public
hearings. "They showed that they cared about what they were doing,"
bank spokesman Tim McGarry said.</TE>
<TE>   After the vote, Griffin repeated opponents' hope that Washington
Mutual will agree to sell or donate its property for parkland. The
bank's acknowledgment that perchlorate is in the ground water will
only make it harder for them to pursue the project, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Washington Mutual is not going to be able to sell a home on this
property," Griffin said.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Bartels said the Ahmanson Ranch development will
provide housing in a region that desperately needs it.</TE>
<TE>   "We are at break point in Southern California," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The players on both sides need to end their bitter feud and "find
a way to live together," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman Wesner indicated he has little hope for that. "This is
not over," he said. "It's going to continue to get slugged out."</TE>

<LD>The state attorney general's office said Friday that its
secret-recording operation at the Orange County district attorney's
office was launched after prosecutors came to believe that a top
district attorney's official lied to law enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, said the
investigation did not result in any criminal charges. He did not
disclose the target of the probe but said it was not Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas.</LD>
<LD>   The attorney general had directed Michael Clesceri, the assistant
chief of investigations for Rackauckas, to secretly record
conversations with fellow employees.</LD>
<TE>   Barankin said the recording occurred last year after Rackauckas
requested the attorney general's help in a case. Rackauckas wanted
the office to determine whether two investigators in his office stole
audiotapes relating to a case involving a friend, Newport Beach
businessman Patrick DiCarlo.</TE>
<TE>   DiCarlo had sought Rackauckas' help because he said he was being
extorted. Rackauckas assigned the two investigators to the case.</TE>
<TE>   But DiCarlo later complained that the investigators treated him
more like a suspect than a crime victim.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas pulled the investigators off the case and accused them
of taking audiotapes related to the probe.</TE>
<TE>   "During the course of that investigation, we received reliable
information that a high-ranking official in the district attorney's
office had lied," Barankin said.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to describe the lie.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's office asked Clesceri to work as an
operative, secretly recording conversations with employees in the
office.</TE>
<TE>   "We authorized the use of a wire for the exclusive and narrow
purpose of trying to corroborate whether that official had indeed
lied," Barankin added. "This was for a narrow purpose, a very narrow
window of time and for a specific reason. We were able to corroborate
that that official had lied, but we did not file charges."</TE>
<TE>   Lying to a law enforcement official under certain circumstances
could be a crime and "at a minimum, it's unethical," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas declined to comment for this story.</TE>
<TE>   Some details of Clesceri's work for the attorney general were
outlined in a letter that his lawyer sent to the office last week.</TE>
<TE>   According to the letter, officials in the district attorney's
office learned of Clesceri's undercover work and have tried to
question him about it.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 13, Clesceri's lawyer, Michael Stone, sent the office a
letter requesting that Clesceri not be questioned about his
undercover work because of an unspecified medical ailment. He also
indicated that Lockyer's office had instructed Clesceri to remain
silent.</TE>

<HD>Beleaguered Film Chief Refuses to Leave Stage</HD>
<DH>Agency lawyers say that he is acting on their advice in
refusing to step down from film permit office. His rejection
infuriates overseers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Berry and Anita M. Busch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The president of the embattled Entertainment Industry Development
Corp. was placed on paid leave Friday by the film permitting agency's
executive committee, but he told his staff hours later he will defy
the vote and refuse to step down.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for the agency said that Cody Cluff, who is under
investigation by county prosecutors for alleged misuse of funds, was
acting on their advice.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiations were continuing late Friday between the EIDC's
lawyers and Keith Comrie, a consultant to the agency recently hired
at the directive of the executive committee.</LD>
<TE>   The lawyers for the agency have contended that the executive
committee, made up largely of city and county officials, did not have
the power to take action against Cluff.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction of Cluff and the EIDC's attorneys to the 8-2 vote
infuriated several committee members, including Los Angeles County
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who vowed to launch an effort to
terminate the EIDC's authority to handle city and county government
film permitting applications if Cluff defies the vote. Yaroslavsky
said he will ask the county board to reconstitute the agency with new
bylaws and leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most preposterous thing I've ever seen in my 27 years
in government," said Yaroslavsky, who serves automatically on the
EIDC's board of directors along with the four other county
supervisors and the Los Angeles City Council. "We find ourselves at
war with our own lawyers, who have made a choice to side with Mr.
Cluff despite the fact that the executive board of this agency has
made a decision that we are legally empowered to make."</TE>
<TE>   If Cluff defies the committee, Yaroslavsky said, "my next step
would be to seek ... to cancel the contract and reconstitute the
organization under different bylaws, rules and different professional
leadership."</TE>
<TE>   The supervisor said he would also ask the EIDC executive committee
to consider whether the agency's lawyers are providing adequate
representation.</TE>
<TE>   The agency was created in 1995 to streamline the city and county's
process for issuing permits for television and film productions and
to promote Los Angeles County to the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles district attorney's office is investigating
alleged misuse of public funds by Cluff and the agency. The criminal
probe is focused in part on whether the EIDC improperly made
political contributions to elected officials, including nearly 20
members of the EIDC's board of directors and executive committee.
Investigators are also looking at whether EIDC funds directed by
Cluff to the Pittsburgh Film Office were misappropriated.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the vote Friday morning, the EIDC's lawyers offered
the executive committee a compromise to end the wrangling, said
Supervisor Gloria Molina and City Council member Wendy Greuel, both
committee members. They said they were told that Cluff would take a
paid leave if the lawyers could continue to represent Cluff and the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   "They're interested in compromise," Molina said, "but they want to
shake us down first."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the comments, EIDC lawyer George Newhouse said,
"Certainly, no one is trying to shake anyone down. We would like to
work out something that gives Cody protection and also expresses the
will of what the executive committee said today."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to putting Cluff on administrative leave, the
executive committee unanimously approved a contract Friday with the
accounting firm KPMG for $297,795 to conduct a financial and
managerial audit of the agency. The audit is expected to take four
months.</TE>
<TE>   The rapidly developing events Friday began when the 11-member
executive committee addressed a motion in closed session to order
Cluff to take a paid leave of absence pending the outcome of the
criminal probe. Sources said the motion called for Cluff to continue
receiving his $200,000 annual salary package, minus his expense
account.</TE>
<TE>   The motion also allowed EIDC consultant Comrie the power to name
an interim president of the EIDC, according to sources. Comrie, a
former city administrative officer of Los Angeles, was recently hired
to organize a management audit and review of the troubled agency.</TE>
<TE>   Executive committee Chairman Frank Scherma, who heads a commercial
production company, sought to prevent the vote on Cluff by ruling the
motion out of order. The committee, on a 7-2 vote, then overruled
Scherma, who once was granted a $340,000 contract to develop an
online permitting system for the agency. The contract was cited in a
search warrant affidavit executed by the district attorney's office
during the investigation. County Supervisors Yvonne Brathwaite Burke,
Molina and Yaroslavsky and City Council members Jan Perry and Greuel
voted in the majority, along with representatives of Mayor James K.
Hahn and Councilman Alex Padilla.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Mike Antonovich cast the only other "no" vote.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the meeting, Newhouse told reporters the
committee's actions were a violation of parliamentary rules and thus
were "ineffective" because the chairman ruled the motion out of
order.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky disagreed, saying that under Robert's Rules of Order,
a ruling of the chairman is challengeable by any member of the board
and that a majority can overrule him.</TE>
<TE>   Friday morning, another EIDC attorney, Tom Brown, said Cluff would
defy the committee's decision and report to work Monday. Late Friday,
however, Newhouse said, "Cody has decided not to come in on Monday
but he's only taking a vacation, not a leave of absence."</TE>
<TE>   A third lawyer representing the EIDC, Randy Hollman, said
Scherma's effort to stop the vote was appropriate because the "the
executive committee does not have the authority" to remove Cluff.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers contend that the agency's bylaws allow Cluff to be
removed only by a vote of the full 49-member board, which usually
meets once a year, in January.</TE>
<TE>   Their statements drew angry responses from committee members,
including Greuel, who said, "I think some of the behavior of our
lawyers today was outrageous and it will be dealt with appropriately.</TE>
<TE>   "The executive committee, under the bylaws, is the responsible
body for this organization," Greuel said. "It is very clear that the
executive board has the authority to hire and fire attorneys and
consultants."</TE>
<TE>   Late in the afternoon, EIDC lawyer Brown, who has represented
Cluff since the criminal probe began in September, said he received
an e-mail from Comrie instructing him not to perform any additional
legal work for the EIDC until its next meeting, which is in two
weeks. In all, five attorneys representing the EIDC showed up at
Friday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the flurry of activity, Cluff gathered his staff together
in a 3 p.m. meeting at the EIDC's Hollywood office and assured them
he would be at work Monday. Later in the day, Newhouse issued his
statement saying Cluff will actually go on vacation for a week
beginning Monday.</TE>

<HD>Straying Girl's Mother Held</HD>
<DH>Stanton woman, 28, faces charges of child endangerment as
three siblings are removed from the home. Man also arrested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after making tearful pleas for her daughter's return, the
mother of an 11-year-old Stanton girl who ran away with a man she met
through a chat room was arrested Friday on charges of child
endangerment. The man was also arrested, accused of sexually abusing
the girl.</LD>
<LD>   Diane Ponce, 28, was being held at the Central Women's Jail in
Santa Ana. Her 11-year-old daughter, 5-year-old daughter and
14-year-old son were placed in protective custody at the Orangewood
Children's Home, said sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino.</LD>
<LD>   "She was part of the problem, and not the solution," Amormino said
of Ponce.</LD>
<TE>   Ponce spent 30 days in jail last year on a previous child
endangerment charge and was taking parenting classes, authorities
said. It was not immediately clear whether the previous arrest
involved the same daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The girl was with a 9-year-old friend outside their apartment
complex on West 2nd Street in Stanton on Tuesday when a dark sport
utility vehicle pulled up.</TE>
<TE>   A witness said she hopped into the passenger seat, leaving
voluntarily with the man at the wheel, but not telling anyone where
she was going.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother did not report her missing until midnight Wednesday,
apparently under the false impression that she had to wait 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department put more than 60 investigators and
uniformed deputies to work looking for the girl.</TE>
<TE>   They found her at a motel about 10 miles from her home about 11:30
p.m. Thursday, about 12 hours after she was spotted with an older man
at a Long Beach music store.</TE>
<TE>   Amormino said that Ponce was being held accountable because she
waited 28 hours to call authorities and allowed her daughter to
repeatedly go on dates with men she met through Internet chat rooms
and telephone party lines. Ponce also failed to seek help from social
service or law enforcement agencies to help correct the girl's
behavior, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents should be responsible," Amormino said. "It's hard to
raise a kid. It's always hard to raise a kid. But I would take
exception [in this case]. What would happen to you if you were 11
years old? That's what you have to ask yourself."</TE>
<TE>   The man, Alfredo Teran, 20, was arrested by Long Beach police and
charged with committing lewd acts on a child, continuous sexual abuse
of a child and oral copulation. He was being held on $50,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe the girl met Teran while on an Internet or
telephone chat line about a week ago. Patricia Greenfield, a
psychology professor and director of the Children's Digital Media
Center at UCLA, said Internet chat rooms are creating a wide
generation gap because many parents have no idea what their children
are being exposed to. These sites are also exposing young girls and
boys to discussions about sex, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly does provide a way for younger girls to meet older
men that used to not exist," Greenfield said. "And it's a mode of
communication that most adults don't know much about."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of kids use chat rooms but most parents are quite unaware
of what's going on," she added. "It's very difficult to monitor. Kids
can find stuff on the Internet that they're not ready for or looking
for. It's that kind of thing that's never been an issue before."</TE>

<HD>'Horrible' Reality Check Gives Pupils Insight Into
Homelessness</HD>
<DH>Myths are shattered as Irvine teens take part in empathy
project</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Manuel Olague started caring about the homeless this week after years
of ignoring them.</LD>
<LD>   "I used to blame homeless people for being that way because they
had given up on themselves," said the 16-year-old, who now drops
dollars into the charity buckets outside his neighborhood grocery
store in Irvine. "Now I've seen that for the vast majority it's not
their fault."</LD>
<LD>   His conversion -- developed over the last week as one of 150
Irvine High School juniors who gave up showers and beds in an effort
to empathize with the homeless -- may last awhile if senior Chris
Amber's experience is any guide.</LD>
<TE>   Chris took part in Project Safety Net last year when it was
launched by HomeAid America, a Costa Mesa-based national organization
that builds shelters for the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   HomeAid organizers saw it as a worthwhile exercise for National
Hunger and Homeless Week, and Irvine High was the only school to sign
up.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction was so positive from students like Chris and their
parents that the principal asked HomeAid if the project could be held
there again this year.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine High students tend to think of their sheltered community,
where about 5% are below the poverty level, as unaffected by social
ills.</TE>
<TE>   That myth was shattered for Chris last year when he realized
several classmates were or had been homeless. Months afterward, he
realized how his perceptions had changed. While flipping through his
middle school yearbook this week, Chris said he became angry when he
spotted a photo of a teacher dressed up for Halloween as a homeless
person with a shopping cart.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sacrificing Comforts</TE>
<TE>   "Back then I thought it was hilarious," he said. "But this project
totally transformed my feelings toward how I saw homeless people. A
year later, that hasn't left me."</TE>
<TE>   This year's exercise was much the same, with students encouraged
to sacrifice tangible and psychological comforts. They begged for
lunch money, shunned their usual social groups and wore the same
clothes without showering for three days.</TE>
<TE>   However, instead of asking students to sleep in their cars at home
as was done last year, HomeAid organized a sleepover in the school
parking lot. The project is expected to expand next year to schools
near HomeAid chapters in Atlanta, Seattle and Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta school, which had been slated to be the first besides
Irvine to participate, pulled out at the last minute this year over
liability concerns about the sleepover.</TE>
<TE>   HomeAid officials hope Project Safety Net will have a ripple
effect among students.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the generation that will shape the policies of the
future," CEO Michael Lennon said. "We want them to understand that
they're dealing with real people and not a bunch of stereotypical
drunks with shopping carts. These students can take a leadership role
in breaking down those myths."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the students visited House of Hope, a homeless shelter
in Orange for women and children.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Machado, 28, who has lived at the shelter for more than a
year, guided the students through the room she shares with her two
sons and the house's living areas.</TE>
<TE>   Machado told them she began living on the streets at 14 after
deciding not to attend high school.</TE>
<TE>   "This project is a good opportunity for them to open their eyes to
what it's like to be in my shoes," Machado said. "It's not fun.
Hopefully some part of this will sink in and they'll make better
choices than I did."</TE>
<TE>   During the visit, many of the students said they were groggy and
sore from a restless night in their cars.</TE>
<TE>   Most had fallen into some semblance of slumber by midnight,
hunkered down in two rows of minivans and cars in the shadow of the
school's tennis courts. Others, such as three girls in a van snuggled
in down comforters and munching on chips and pink-frosted cookies,
stayed up to share thoughts about the week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'It's Depressing'</TE>
<TE>   "It started out as a game to us, but I'm realizing that it's
horrible to live this way, to struggle day to day," said 17-year-old
Amanda Womack. "It's depressing to know this is reality for a lot of
people."</TE>
<TE>   Fellow juniors Aubree Gilbert and Ashley Dupree told Amanda how
the project made them realize that they, too, had been temporarily
homeless years before.</TE>
<TE>   Aubree's family had shuffled between relatives for more than a
year. Ashley said hers did the same, and that they still struggle in
a house that's too small.</TE>
<TE>   "People may say doing this is kind of a shallow way to start
thinking about homelessness," said Ashley, 16. "But at least there's
been an effort to get some sort of understanding. That's a lot more
than most kids in places like Irvine can say."</TE>

<HD>Do Mormon Rules Have a Place in Plaza?</HD>
<DH>Court battle rages over a Salt Lake temple area where the
church has imposed restrictions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Just outside the wrought-iron gates of the historic temple here, a
Baptist preacher from Southern California politely hands out leaflets
urging passersby to give up the Mormon faith. "Don't count your
temple tradition greater than Jesus ... repent your sins," reads the
text.</LD>
<LD>   It's not easy work. Kurt Van Gorden's attempts to convert members
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to his kind of
Christianity in the shadow of its holiest site is met with stony
silence and glares. He is often photographed by church security
guards. And last spring, his efforts in Main Street Plaza -- owned by
the church but with public walkways running through it -- even landed
him in jail for an afternoon, though no charges were filed.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sure I'm a pain to the Mormon Church," said the Victorville
resident, who says he makes the 1,200-mile round trip to Salt Lake
City about once a month to follow his calling to save Mormons. "But
do they see how much of a pain they are to the Constitution and
American citizens?"</LD>
<TE>   Van Gorden is one of many who have defied attempts by church
leaders to regulate behavior in Main Street Plaza, a block of Main
Street that the city sold to the church in 1999 for $8.1 million.
Others include civil liberties activists and ordinary residents fed
up with what they perceive as Mormon domination.</TE>
<TE>   The debate has escalated into a lawsuit, now headed to the U.S.
Supreme Court, that asks: Is the park a private place where visitors
should act like guests of the church? Or do the public walkways allow
for free, even offensive, speech in the shadows of the granite temple
built by Brigham Young and other Mormon pioneers?</TE>
<TE>   The case also has created an unlikely group of national allies for
the church, organizations as diverse as the Islamic Society of
Colorado Springs and the National League of Cities, which are worried
that an adverse ruling could wipe out the notion of limited easements
that allow public access to beaches, mountain trails and other
places.</TE>
<TE>   But it's more than a debate over civil liberties. In some ways
this also is a dialogue over the soul of this city. Though Mormons
predominate in Utah, and the church is by far the city's most
powerful institution, less than half of Salt Lake residents belong to
the church. While all seven City Council members are Mormons, the
city's powerful mayor is often critical of the church.</TE>
<TE>   The idea to turn a block of Main Street into a pedestrian plaza
was first proposed 40 years ago as part of a downtown revitalization
plan. The city agreed in 1999 to sell the narrow slice of property
running along the front of Temple Square to the church, which then
spent more than $10 million creating an oasis of serenity with brick
walkways, fountains, a reflecting pool, trees and flowers.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was to create a strip of parkland that would unite Temple
Square and the church's administrative buildings across Main Street.
In an effort to accommodate the public, however, city officials
struck a deal with the church: The sale agreement called for a
restricted public easement that allows pedestrians in the park at any
hour but under strict rules.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement gave church security officers power to decide who
was violating the rules. They could bar, for example, non-Mormon
groups holding protests or distributing literature, women wearing
halter tops and men without shirts. One newspaper columnist reported
a microbrewery worker being escorted from the plaza for wearing a
shirt that read: "We support 3.2% tithing and 10% beer."</TE>
<TE>   Though the proposal for Main Street Plaza was discussed in
numerous public hearings and community meetings, news of the
completed deal in 1999 shocked many in town, said the Rev. Tom
Goldsmith of the 500-family First Unitarian Church. Soon afterward,
his church became the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit brought by the
American Civil Liberties Union against the city contending the deal
improperly gave away public rights. The Mormon Church joined in the
defense.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, work proceeded on the park and the faithful and
protesters alike flocked to the plaza when it opened in the fall of
2000. On most days, a seemingly endless stream of young brides in
white gowns poses for photos in front of the plaza's reflecting pool,
with the temple's 210-foot-high spires soaring in the background.</TE>
<TE>   But the religious atmosphere is sometimes interrupted by shouts
from protesters in the plaza, just a few yards from the temple's
front door.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always heckling," said Donna Busath, a Salt Lake City
resident who recently spoke before the City Council. "It's totally
disrespectful. No cultured person would go outside the gates of
someone's sacred building and do that."</TE>
<TE>   But Mormon critics argue that the church sends out an estimated
65,000 missionaries each year to proselytize on private property that
many consider sacred: people's homes.</TE>
<TE>   "They've told us that this is a holy place," Van Gorden said,
standing outside the east gates of Temple Square. "But our home is a
holy place too. For us it's no different."</TE>
<TE>   Goldsmith, the Unitarian pastor, said he finds evangelists who
work just outside the temple to be both rude and intolerant.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm personally nauseated by this Los Angeles guy [Van Gorden],"
Goldsmith said. "That's not what we're about. But we had to protest."</TE>
<TE>   The city and church won the first legal round last year when a
federal district judge dismissed the suit, ruling that the
restrictions were reasonable for an "ecclesiastical park."</TE>
<TE>   But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver reversed the
ruling, finding that "the city may not exchange the public's
constitutional rights even for other public benefits." Church
officials have suspended enforcement of the behavior rules but plan
to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "This is kind of ironical," said H. David Burton, the church's
presiding bishop in charge of business affairs. "This was an outreach
to the community. This was an expenditure of millions of dollars, not
only to enhance the downtown and enhance the church campus, but to
reach out to the community and say, 'Here is a place you can come and
sit and not be disturbed.' It's interesting that with that kind of
outreach, we're in this kind of dilemma."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Ross C. "Rocky" Anderson, a former ACLU leader and lapsed
Mormon, is leading one effort to settle the dispute. He plans to
propose to the City Council as early as this week a revised set of
limitations -- time-place-and-manner restrictions, in legal parlance
-- on visitors to the property. He believes the restrictions, applied
to everyone, including Mormons, will be constitutionally sound and in
line with rules at other sensitive public venues across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Another proposal, backed by Mormon leaders and members, is simply
to give up the public easement. Church officials point out that a
separate provision of the sale agreement binds them to provide
24-hour public access even if the park becomes entirely private
property; in such a case, however, the church would be protected from
legal challenges to any limits it imposes.</TE>
<TE>   "There seems to be a simple solution that would keep everybody in
the same position they were in at the time the sale took place,"
Burton said. "With that, the church would have the opportunity of
exercising its property rights. Of course, the city would be
guaranteed that the citizenry would have access."</TE>
<TE>   This option also is supported by the Mormon-dominated City
Council. It recently hired its own attorney to determine if it can
usurp the mayor's traditional authority in property matters and give
the public walkways to the church.</TE>
<TE>   But that solution could lead to even more litigation, from the
mayor or ACLU.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be an abdication of the city's responsibility and the
abdication of the key thing that the city bargained for here," said
Stephen C. Clark, an ACLU attorney who filed the original suit and
promised another if the public easement is given away. "A gift to the
church would create a whole new set of constitutional issues."</TE>
<TE>   Under Anderson's direction, the city halted its legal defense
after the federal appeals court ruling, leaving the church
momentarily alone in the legal battle. But 20 organizations joined
the church in its fight, concerned that the use of limited public
easements -- such as paths to the beach or trail heads over public
property -- could be wiped out by an adverse ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "It has potentially mammoth consequences around the country,
because of all the implications that that could portend for other
kinds of institutions and the granting of easements, period," Burton
said. "I don't know if there's ever been a time in the history of our
church that so many others joined with us. We're usually a little bit
out there alone."</TE>
<TE>   The battle over public opinion in Salt Lake City remains fierce.
The church distributed thousands of brochures to residents and
leaders this week arguing its position.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council plans to hold a fact-finding hearing next month
that will feature testimony from original participants in the 1999
Main Street Plaza deal.</TE>
<TE>   And liberal forces in the city continue to lobby their mayor, who
is up for reelection next year, to make sure he doesn't waver on his
vow to keep the sidewalks public.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a huge betrayal to the people of this community to
convey [the easement] to the church," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mormon officials have agreed to abide by the ruling of
the federal appeals court and allow free speech on the public
walkways of Main Street Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   But even that is tricky.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to restore his fading summer tan, Tom Lowery took advantage
of a recent Indian summer afternoon in Salt Lake City, stripping off
his teal polo shirt to sunbathe in Main Street Plaza park.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting on the grass -- and not on the public walkway -- he had
only been soaking up rays for a few minutes when two church security
guards in blue blazers and wearing tiny earpieces cast their shadows
on him.</TE>
<TE>   "Could you please do us a favor and put on your shirt?" one asked
politely. "This is private property."</TE>
<TE>   Lowery, 51, shook his head. "Nope," he replied. "I believe this
area has been ruled public by the courts."</TE>
<TE>   The guards threatened to call the police. Lowery told them to go
ahead. And the stalemate continued.</TE>

<HD>Band on the Run Rejoices in a Return to Its Roots</HD>
<DH>No Doubt, on last leg of world tour, gets keys to the
hometown it mocked in lyrics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No Doubt, the Anaheim-born band that dubbed its home the "Tragic
Kingdom" en route to rock stardom, Friday returned to the town they
lampooned for the ultimate civic honor.</LD>
<LD>   That's right, the keys to the city.</LD>
<LD>   Band members received the distinction at Disneyland, no less, the
same place they poked fun at in the multiplatinum album "Tragic
Kingdom," which includes images of rotten oranges and lyrics mocking
the Seven Dwarfs and the hallowed Main Street Electrical Parade.</LD>
<TE>   They came home to the town where they spent their youth, attended
high school football games and struggled to find themselves. And
although they may now be a world-famous band, on Friday morning they
seemed more like the kids next door.</TE>
<TE>   When the band came out on stage, lead singer Gwen Stefani searched
the crowd for her mother. And when Mayor Tom Daly handed over the
ceremonial keys, an honor not even bestowed on Walt Disney, the
band's parents and grandparents were in the audience, snapping photos
like the rest of the groupies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like coming full circle," said bass player Tony Kanal. "Who
would have ever thought we would be here?"</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Leena Kanal, still works in the city's finance
department. She ranked Friday's achievement up there with the band's
first record deal. And dad, Gulab Kanal, who once ushered his
saxophone-playing son to jazz band practice at South Junior High in
Anaheim, called it a milestone.</TE>
<TE>   The band has such a connection to Anaheim that one fan joked that
locals like to play "six degrees of separation" with No Doubt because
they know someone who knows someone who has some connection to the
group.</TE>
<TE>   Before their early morning breakfast concert, compliments of radio
station KROQ and the Kevin &amp; Bean Show, the band pondered those early
days, recalling their favorite Anaheim restaurant -- Mexi-Casa
Mexican Food ("We lived on that for years and years and years,"
drummer Adrian Young said). They also mentioned the time they took
sips of alcohol at Disneyland, a rite of passage of sorts among
Orange County's more adventurous youth.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to work at Disneyland," Stefani said. "I wanted to sing
songs at the Disneyland Hotel. ... Videopolis was here. I used to
come dancing here."</TE>
<TE>   This visit, she didn't have to pay to get in. And if there were
any sore feelings about No Doubt's digs at the Magic Kingdom, they
were forgotten Friday and the band was treated like royalty.</TE>
<TE>   Disney rolled out the red carpet, putting up No Doubt in a suite
at the Grand Californian Hotel, with rooms overlooking California
Adventure. The musicians spent Thursday night riding roller coasters.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the band has moved beyond its Orange County roots,
trading the Anaheim Beacon Street digs where they once recorded their
aptly-titled "Beacon Street Collection" album for more glamorous
environs in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they said Friday, there's no place like home.</TE>
<TE>   A fan asked them their favorite venue to perform, including the
spots in Europe and Asia they hit this year as part of their Rock
Steady tour, which wraps up Nov. 30 at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to say rolling into Anaheim and getting a suite at
[Disney's Grand Californian] was just amazing," Stefani said. "I
liked coming home."</TE>
<TE>   And the city, flush with the success of its world champion Angels,
isn't afraid to ride the band's success and home-grown charm--even if
it comes with some playful jabs.No Doubt's appearance gave Anaheim,
which spouts census numbers (it's one of the county's most youthful
cities) and pays homage to its youth, another opportunity to boost
its image.</TE>
<TE>   "Beneath the suburban veneer, this is a very, very dynamic,
youthful, risk-taking place," Mayor Daly said. "Orange County has
always been receptive to big dreams."</TE>

<HD>EPA Eases Pollution Guidelines</HD>
<DH>New rules will allow flexibility in meeting clean-air
regulations on plant repairs, upgrades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>By Elizabeth Shogren Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Environmental Protection Agency granted industry a long-standing
wish Friday by allowing companies greater flexibility in complying
with clean-air requirements when they repair and expand their plants.</LD>
<LD>   It also proposed a rules change that would allow industry to count
substantial modifications as "routine maintenance" without triggering
requirements for installing up-to-date, plant-wide pollution
controls.</LD>
<LD>   Industry groups welcomed the new flexibility, but complained of
continued uncertainty because the proposed rules are not final and
could be changed before they take effect.</LD>
<TE>   Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating
Council, said EPA's announcement "brings some greater rationality" to
clean-air regulation. "We believe that EPA has left some unfinished
business on the table," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, congressional Democrats and officials in
heavily polluted states, by contrast, condemned EPA's actions as
likely to allow big polluters to pollute even more.</TE>
<TE>   "These regulations are replete with major loopholes that will
allow industry throughout the country to escape requirements for
state-of-the-art pollution controls," said William Becker, executive
director of associations of state and local pollution control
officials.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations are changes to a set of rules put in place by
the Clinton administration that required companies to install
state-of-the-art pollution controls when they made major
modifications or additions to existing plants.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules generally will not affect California, because its
clean-air laws are tougher than the federal law.</TE>
<TE>   But about half the states operate under laws that prevent them
from adopting tougher pollution controls than the federal standards.</TE>
<TE>   Southern and Midwestern states that rely on coal-burning power
plants for their electricity, and the states that are downwind from
them, are potentially most affected by the rule changes.</TE>
<TE>   New York and Connecticut, whose skies are choked with pollution
that flows in from industrial centers and power plants west of them,
led a movement of state officials to block the regulations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Call for Resignation</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), arguing that the White House
forced EPA to accept the rule changes, called on EPA Administrator
Christie Whitman to resign in protest.</TE>
<TE>   "All this rule will do is extend the life of the dirtiest
industrial plants and worsen the lives of citizens that breathe the
pollution from their smokestacks every day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "These changes represent the most serious attack on the Clean Air
Act in its nearly 30-year history," said Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.).</TE>
<TE>   "They will lead to more air pollution, more smog and more cases of
asthma and other preventable illnesses in American children and
adults," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The changes reflect the Bush administration philosophy that if
industry is allowed more flexibility, it will voluntarily reduce
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "EPA is taking actions now to improve [regulation] and thereby
encourage emissions reductions," Whitman said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials said the changes were necessary because many
companies now refrain from modifying their plants to make them more
efficient and productive because it triggers the requirement to
install modern pollution control devices.</TE>
<TE>   The result is bad for the economy and for the air, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Changes This Year</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The steps we are taking today recognize that some aspects of the
program have deterred companies from implementing projects that would
increase energy efficiency and decrease air pollution," Whitman said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the regulatory changes announced Friday will take effect
this year after a formal review by the White House Office of
Management and Budget.</TE>
<TE>   One of the changes will allow companies to enter into agreements
with air regulators to keep emissions at their plants below an
agreed-upon cap. The companies could retool and modernize these
plants without triggering the requirement to install modern pollution
control devices, as long as their total emissions did not exceed the
cap.</TE>
<TE>   EPA said this provision will be particularly helpful to computer
chip manufacturers and other cutting-edge industries that frequently
change their production lines.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Calculations</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another change would reward the installation of state-of-the-art
pollution controls with 10 years of immunity from governmental
pollution reviews.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules also change the calculation of whether a plant
modification would increase pollution. The plant owner could compute
the increase based on any 24-month period in the last 10 years, not
necessarily the most recent 24 months.</TE>
<TE>   John Walke, director the clean-air program at the Natural
Resources Defense Council, said these changes were designed to
disguise pollution increases.</TE>
<TE>   "On paper, the gimmick indicates there has been no increase in
pollution," Walke said. "But the air gets dirtier in the real world."</TE>
<TE>   Many observers said the more significant part of Friday's
regulatory package was a proposal that faces months of public comment
and governmental review before taking effect. This would change the
definition of "routine maintenance" to a plant.</TE>
<TE>   Routine maintenance does not trigger requirements for updated
pollution controls. Friday's proposal would classify substantial
renovations as routine maintenance.</TE>

<HD>FBI Looks at Saudi's Link to 9/11</HD>
<DH>The man aided two of the hijackers. Possible higher-level
links are a point of contention.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The FBI is investigating a Saudi Arabian man who provided assistance
to two of the Sept. 11 hijackers, a disclosure that comes amid fierce
debate in the intelligence community over whether the investigation
also points to disturbing new links between the attacks and the Saudi
government.</LD>
<LD>   Government sources said Friday there are some indications that
high-level Saudi officials were providing money to at least one man,
who in turn helped San Diego-based hijackers get established in the
United States by making rent payments and providing other assistance.</LD>
<LD>   But congressional and Justice Department sources said they
disagree sharply over what to make of the apparent financial links.
The debate centers on whether the Saudi sponsors knew the money was
going to terrorists -- let alone being used to support the Sept. 11
plot -- and whether the individuals were acting on their own or on
behalf of the Saudi government.</LD>
<TE>   Sources said that remains a central and unresolved question before
the joint congressional panel conducting an ongoing probe of
intelligence failures surrounding the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But FBI officials said they have investigated two Saudi men in
connection with financial support provided to hijackers, and found no
evidence of anything unusual. They determined that the men routinely
helped newcomers from Arab countries with modest financial help.</TE>
<TE>   "That is something we would be interested in," one congressional
source said. Investigators "want to find out the complicity or
knowledge of officials of a foreign government."</TE>
<TE>   "If members felt there was some complicity or active knowledge and
support, that would be a big deal," the source said. "But we're not
there yet. All we have is circumstantial evidence."</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of Saudi government links to the hijackers is
sensitive for the Bush administration, which values the oil-rich
Persian Gulf state as an important ally, one that is even more
important as the U.S. government contemplates a war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The matter has become a source of significant friction between
congressional investigators and the Justice Department. Sen. Bob
Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has
been pressuring the Justice Department for weeks to declassify new
information and evidence surrounding the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In recent interviews, Graham has refused to discuss the nature of
that evidence, but sources have said that it relates to connections
between the San Diego hijackers and a foreign government. The San
Diego hijackers, Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid Almihdhar, were both Saudi
citizens and were among those who commandeered a commercial jetliner
that crashed into the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional sources said lawmakers are frustrated that the FBI
hasn't been more aggressive in pursuing the matter.</TE>
<TE>   But a Justice Department official said the FBI has been aware of
the evidence since shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, and is
convinced that it does not point to Saudi complicity in the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a suspected linkage that isn't true," the official said,
adding that the matter is so sensitive that many believe even airing
the suggestions of Saudi links will significantly hamper the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the FBI declined to comment Friday, citing its ongoing
investigation into terrorism. Spokesman Steven Berry, reading from a
prepared statement, said that the FBI continues to investigate a man
who assisted the terrorists, Omar Al Bayoumi, and a second Saudi,
Osama Bassnan. The bureau noted that it previously charged both men
with visa fraud but said: "For obvious reasons, the FBI does not
divulge details of its pending investigations."</TE>
<TE>   But two high-ranking FBI officials said this week that there was
no evidence that the hijackers received financial support from any
foreign power while they lived in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "There are absolutely no facts that would support that theory,"
said one official.</TE>
<TE>   "We have people we know associated with the hijackers ... but they
didn't do things for the hijackers that they had not already done for
50 other Moslems" who came to San Diego from abroad, one of the FBI
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Al Bayoumi first met Almihdhar and Alhazmi in late 1999 at a Los
Angeles restaurant and later brought them to San Diego's large Muslim
community, paying their first two months rent at an apartment in the
neighborhood of Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   Bassnan lived for a time in the same Clairemont apartment building
as Al Bayoumi and was known as the "Unofficial Saudi Mayor of San
Diego."</TE>
<TE>   Two days after the Sept. 11 attacks, FBI agents began questioning
Muslims in San Diego about Al Bayoumi. And 10 days after the attacks,
he was detained in Birmingham, England, where he was then enrolled at
Aston University, at the request of the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Al Bayoumi was released a week later, strongly denying any
knowledge of the terrorist attacks or links to Al Qaeda, and is
believed to be in England today.</TE>
<TE>   Bassan, meantime, was recently deported by the U.S. after pleading
no contest to charges of visa fraud, authorities said. He was
returned to Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said FBI agents determined that the hijackers repaid Al
Bayoumi and other individuals whatever money they had been provided
during their time in San Diego. "The hijackers didn't need their
money," said one source. "They had their other [financial] sources"
for terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Records and interviews show that Al Bayoumi moved to San Diego in
late 1995 or early 1996 and left for England in April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   While in San Diego, Al Bayoumi, 45, was married and had a high
school age son and daughter, and a younger boy and girl. His children
attended public schools. He lived in two apartment complexes located
about two blocks from the Islamic Center of San Diego, the largest
mosque in San Diego County, where about 100,000 Muslims live.</TE>
<TE>   During his years in San Diego, Al Bayoumi was a well known but
mysterious figure in the local Muslim community. Despite his age he
told people he was a student at U.S. International University and
holder of two masters degrees. But with the exception of a close
friend, nobody ever saw him with textbooks or even going to class.</TE>
<TE>   Sources at the Islamic Center said Al Bayoumi used to spend a lot
of time there, praying, socializing, picking up gossip and meeting
new immigrants or arrivals. Although he did not work, Al Bayoumi did
not want for money. The apartments he lived in are comfortable and
well-maintained, not flashy. The buildings are in a middle class
community where homes typically sell from $350,000 to $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor whom Al Bayoumi befriended said Al Bayoumi told him he
was receiving a stipend from the aviation company he worked for in
Saudi Arabia. Al Bayoumi told this source that he worked in "airline
management." However, the neighbor also said that Al Bayoumi's wife
came from a wealthy family and guessed that they may have also been a
source of Al Bayoumi's income.</TE>
<TE>   Published reports in the U.S. and Britain say Al Bayoumi worked
for Dallah-AVCO, a company that contracts with the Saudi aviation
authority. Company officials confirmed to the Wall Street Journal and
Manchester Guardian that Al Bayoumi was an employee.</TE>
<TE>   Other sources said Al Bayoumi also told them he was being paid by
his company while studying in the U.S, but he never told them where
he worked. Still others said he told them he was living off a
scholarship from the Saudi government.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery surrounding Al Bayoumi's source of income raised
suspicions, as did his habit of videotaping people at social events
and soccer games. Many believed he was a Saudi spy, keeping tabs on
Saudi students, nationals and other Middle Easterners.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a common belief that he was a spy or [Saudi] government
agent. People were suspicious and afraid of him," said a local Muslim
leader who knows Al Bayoumi. "Oh, he was mysterious. He was polite
and nice, but usually alone. I can't think of anybody who was his
close friend."</TE>
<TE>   Another Muslim leader said suspicions about Al Bayoumi increased
one day when his wallet fell out of his pants pocket during prayer
service at the center. The man who picked it up noticed a police type
credential inside issued by the Saudi government. Al Bayoumi was
aware that others believed he was a Saudi spy, said a neighbor. "We
used to laugh and joke about that," said the man.</TE>
<TE>   As for Al Bayoumi's habit of carrying a video recorder everywhere,
the neighbor said: "The guy considered himself an artist, a
videographer. He loved to make movies."</TE>
<TE>   According to the neighbor, Al Bayoumi did not approve of
Palestinian suicide bombers. "He'd say, 'What's the point? Innocent
people are killed and it invites retaliation.' ... His idea of jihad
was to make something of our lives so we can help ourselves and other
Muslims in America."</TE>
<TE>   The neighbor said Al Bayoumi admired many things about America,
especially its political system. "He really admired American politics
and how the U.S. is governed."</TE>
<TE>   The neighbor was not the only young Arab singled out for special
attention by Al Bayoumi.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous sources said Al Bayoumi brought Alhazmi and Almihdhar to
San Diego from Los Angeles in late 1999 or early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A former roommate of Alhazmi said that even Alhazmi was suspicious
of Al Bayoumi, despite their close ties.</TE>
<TE>   Alhazmi, according to the former roommate, said he and Almihdhar
were in a Los Angeles restaurant when Al Bayoumi walked by their
table and pretended to drop a newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   He picked up the paper and told the two men he overheard them
speaking Arabic and was comforted by hearing his native tongue in a
strange land. After striking up a conversation with them, Al Bayoumi
offered to bring the men to San Diego and help them get established.</TE>
<TE>   Upon arriving in San Diego, Al Bayoumi helped Alhazmi and
Almihdhar find an apartment at the Parkwood Apartments, down the
street from the Islamic Center. Records show Al Bayoumi had recently
moved into the Parkwood after living at another complex a block away
for four years.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't find it unusual that he paid their rent," said the
neighbor. "He's a very generous person. The FBI's notion that [Al
Bayoumi] helped the terrorists plan the attacks is way off base. In
his mind, he was only helping two fellow Saudis. He especially liked
to help students."</TE>
<TE>   The neighbor said that Al Bayoumi "had a lot of contact" with the
Saudi Embassy in Washington. Al Bayoumi told him that he talked to
people at the embassy a lot because he was always ordering copies of
the Koran for local mosques, and that the only accurate English
copies of the Koran came from Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   He also told the neighbor and others that he used contacts at the
embassy and the Saudi Consulate in Los Angeles to obtain financial
support for Saudi students in San Diego. A source at the Islamic
Center said the consulate provides social services for Saudi students
and monitors Saudi student clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "He drove to L.A. a lot, to the consulate," said the source.
"Somehow, he knew who the Saudi students were and tried to get close
to every one of them. This smelled fishy to a lot of people. Why
would a 44-year-old man, who was a student that never went to school,
want to hang out with younger college students? This is why a lot of
people thought he was spying for the Saudi government."</TE>
<TE>   Al Bayoumi was described as being "very nationalistic" by his
neighbor and always willing to assist a fellow Saudi. The source at
the Islamic Center said Al Bayoumi was not shy about voicing support
for the Saudi government. This source said that Al Bayoumi's "loyalty
to the Saudi government exceeded his loyalty to his family."</TE>
<TE>   In early 2000, after Ramadan, Al Bayoumi hosted a party at
Alhazmi's and Almihdhar's apartment to introduce them to the
community. The party was attended by 30 to 40 invited men from
throughout San Diego County, who dined on lamb and rice.</TE>
<TE>   A source who was at the party said Alhazmi and Almihdhar did not
say much, except that they were here to study English. Al Bayoumi
asked those in attendance to welcome the pair to San Diego and help
them get established here.</TE>
<TE>   It is a tradition in Muslim communities to welcome newcomers, but
nobody could recall Al Bayoumi hosting a welcome party for anybody
else.</TE>
<TE>   After the party, Al Bayoumi was often seen in the company of
Alhazmi and Almihdhar. "Nawaf [Alhazmi] and Khalid [Almihdhar] and Al
Bayoumi were very close. Whatever help they needed, they got it from
him," said the source from the Islamic Center.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2000, the source said, Al Bayoumi directed Alhazmi to a
Kuwaiti man at the Islamic Center. Alhazmi asked the man if his
brother in Saudi Arabia could wire $5,000 to the man's bank account
for Alhazmi. The man agreed.</TE>
<TE>   The source said the funds were transferred April 18, 2000 through
the Royal Bank of Canada. But it came from Dubai, United Arab
Emirates, not Saudi Arabia. And the sender was identified only as
"Ali." This made the Kuwaiti suspicious of Alhazmi. It was the last
favor he did for the eventual terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's failure to secure Al Bayoumi's arrest only fueled
speculation in San Diego that he was a Saudi agent.</TE>

<HD>9/11 Kin Expand Suit That Aims to Bankrupt Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A $15-trillion lawsuit aimed at bankrupting the alleged financiers of
Al Qaeda grew even larger Friday, as the plaintiffs added more than
three dozen new defendants, including members of the Saudi royal
family.</LD>
<LD>   Relatives of the 3,000 people who died in the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks are named as plaintiffs in the suit, which was filed Aug. 15
and now runs almost 400 pages. The newly amended complaint, filed
Friday, alleges that:</LD>
<LD>   * The Saudi American Bank financed Sudanese projects benefiting
Osama bin Laden while he and Al Qaeda operated from that country and
serves as the Riyadh correspondent for two other banks involved in
financing Al Qaeda operations. The bank has an office in New York and
is 20% owned by Citibank, though Citibank is not named as a
defendant.</LD>
<TE>   * Prince Nayif ibn Abdulaziz, the Saudi interior minister and a
member of the royal family, gave Al Qaeda money in support of
international terrorism. In addition, as interior minister, he
controls the activities of numerous Islamic charities that have
helped finance Al Qaeda, the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   * Prince Abudullah al Faisal bin Abdulaziz al Saud, the former
Saudi health minister and a royal family member, aided Al Qaeda
through his role as majority owner of Alfaisaliah Group, which
employed an Al Qaeda financier, Muhammed Galeb Kalaje Zouaydi, who is
now jailed in Spain awaiting trial.</TE>
<TE>   * Bank al-Taqwa Limited of Nassau, Bahamas, raises, manages,
invests and distributes funds for Al Qaeda. President Bush called for
a freeze on the bank's assets last November.</TE>
<TE>   * Ary Gold Ltd. of Dubai helped financial officers assisting Al
Qaeda to ship large quantities of gold out of Pakistan and Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the complaint contains new allegations against one
previously named defendant, Prince Turki al Faisal al Saud, the
former Saudi intelligence chief.</TE>
<TE>   The suit cites a sworn statement by Mullah Kakshar, a former
Taliban official who has defected, which implicates Turki in large
money transfers from wealthy Saudis to the Taliban and Al Qaeda in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The thrust of the lawsuit is that the 186 defendants -- including
numerous foreign banks, dozens of Islamic foundations, Osama bin
Laden, the Republic of Sudan, an Islamic Cultural Center in Milan and
a diamond company in Africa -- knowingly provided money and other aid
to terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   This enabled them to perpetrate the Sept. 11 attacks as well as
other terrorist acts, the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   "This civil action seeks to hold those responsible for a more
subtle and insidious form of terrorism, that which attempts to hide
behind the facade of legitimacy," the complaint states.</TE>
<TE>   "These entities, cloaked in a thin veil of legitimacy, were and
are the true enablers of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorists like Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network do not
exist in a vacuum. They cannot plan, train and act on a massive scale
without significant financial power, coordination and backing," the
complaint adds.</TE>
<TE>   "The day of reckoning" is coming for these defendants, said Ronald
L. Motley, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, who is financing the case
with some of the many millions of dollars in fees he received for
successfully suing the nation's leading cigarette makers.</TE>
<TE>   Motley said his team of lawyers and investigators is receiving
assistance from government investigators in 13 countries, including
Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Britain, Germany, Israel, Italy, Russia
and Spain.</TE>
<TE>   "We have people in London, Belgium, Bosnia as I speak," said
Motley, of Mt. Pleasant, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   The suit is expected to benefit from the terrorism insurance law
passed this week, which has a provision designed to help victims of
terrorism recover their losses.</TE>
<TE>   None of the defendants could be reached Friday.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Sudan said in August that the country had no
involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks. The suit contains lengthy
allegations that Sudan and two government ministries helped foster Al
Qaeda's growth during the 1990s, when Bin Laden lived there.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi government is not a named defendant in the lawsuit.
Still, the complaint acknowledges that the suit may raise questions
about whether such a case "interferes with or augments U.S. foreign
policy interests."</TE>
<TE>   The suit quotes statements of President Bush, Richard Allen,
former national security advisor to President Reagan, and other U.S.
government officials on the importance of curbing the flow of cash to
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   While not publicly commenting on the suit, Saudi officials have
expressed concern about it to Bush administration officials. News
reports in late October said the U.S. might ask a federal district
judge in Washington to dismiss the case on grounds that it could be
injurious to U.S. relations with the Saudi government.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs, banded together as "the 9/11 Families United to
Bankrupt Terrorism," were sufficiently concerned about those reports
that they took out a full-page advertisement in the Washington Post
on Nov. 1, urging President Bush not to interfere with the case in an
attempt to appease Saudi officials.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for the State Department and the White House declined
comment Friday. But on the day the families' ad was published, a
State Department spokesman said: "At this stage, the Department of
State has no plans to intervene in this case."</TE>
<TE>   No one was available for comment at the Saudi Embassy in
Washington. Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi citizens.</TE>
<TE>   At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Washington
attorney Alan Gerson, Motley's co-counsel, reiterated the concerns of
the families and said they had received no response from the White
House to their Nov. 1 plea.</TE>
<TE>   Gerson compared the situation to private civil damage suits that
arose out of civil rights battles and "bankrupted the Ku Klux Klan."</TE>

<HD>2nd GI Is Acquitted of Girls' Death in S. Korea</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>A U.S. military jury acquitted an American soldier of negligent
homicide charges Friday, five months after the vehicle he was driving
on a training mission struck and killed two South Korean girls.</LD>
<LD>   The acquittal of Sgt. Mark Walker followed Wednesday's acquittal
of the vehicle's commander, Sgt. Fernando Nino, on the same charges</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of activists hurled eggs and paint bottles into Camp Casey,
the U.S. military base north of Seoul where the trial took place,
while the jury deliberated for 4 1/2 hours Friday. The demonstrators
called the trial a sham.</LD>
<TE>   Lt. Gen. Charles C. Campbell, commander of the 8th U.S. Army,
appealed to South Koreans to trust the judgment of the jury panels.</TE>
<TE>   "Taken together, the verdicts in the two trials that were rendered
by two different impartial panels indicate that what occurred was a
tragic accident without criminal culpability," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He reiterated his "apology and deepest sympathies" to the victims'
families. "This was a tragic loss of life and we are deeply sorry,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Walker and Nino, who belong to the 2nd U.S. Infantry Division,
were on a training mission June 13 near the border with North Korea
when their mine-clearing vehicle struck Shim Mi Son and Shin Hyo Sun,
both 14.</TE>
<TE>   The vehicle was going uphill and around a bend in a rural area
when it hit the girls.</TE>
<TE>   Walker had faced up to six years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Since Nino's acquittal Wednesday, South Korean political parties
have called for revising a U.S.-South Korean military accord on
jurisdiction in cases involving U.S. soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the U.S. military has jurisdictional rights over
American soldiers accused of crimes while on duty, though it can
allow South Korea to try them on a case-by-case basis.</TE>

<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said Friday that he had
rejected an offer by his chief spokeswoman to resign after she was
quoted as calling President Bush a moron.</LD>
<LD>   The reported remark by Francoise Ducros during a NATO summit in
Prague prompted demands from Canadian opposition politicians that she
be fired.</LD>
<LD>   Chretien told journalists that no one in the U.S. delegation had
referred to the comments during several meetings at the summit and he
joked that Ducros uses the word "moron" regularly.</LD>
<TE>   "She said to me that if it's causing too much of a problem, she
offered her resignation, and I did not accept that because it was a
private conversation."</TE>
<TE>   The offending quote, as reported in the National Post and the Sun
Media chain of newspapers, was, "What a moron."</TE>
<TE>   The White House, too, has brushed off the remark, but the incident
is unlikely to improve the already rocky relationship between Bush
and Chretien, who is clearly uncomfortable with the U.S. president's
threats of war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Former Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark, leader of the minority
Conservatives, told Parliament that the bilateral relationship was
too important to treat the incident lightly.</TE>
<TE>   Ducros issued a statement apologizing but saying she had not
criticized Bush in her official capacity. "The comments attributed to
me in no way reflect my personal view of the president of the United
States," it said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Nurse on Trial in Monaco for Billionaire Banker's
Death in Fire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTE CARLO</DL>
<LD>An American nurse who has confessed to setting a blaze that killed
his billionaire employer said in a Monaco court Friday that he never
expected the fire to rage out of control.</LD>
<LD>   On the second day of his trial, Ted Maher indicated that the fire
was part of a bizarre plan to ingratiate himself with Edmond Safra,
his wealthy employer. Safra, the founder and principal stock owner of
Republic National Bank of New York, died in the Dec. 3, 1999, blaze
in his Monaco penthouse, along with Viviane Torrente, one of his
private nurses.</LD>
<LD>   Looking gaunt and speaking in a monotone, Maher told the court
that he started the blaze in a small wastebasket, expecting it to set
off a fire alarm that would bring help and allow him to reap the
credit for saving his employer.</LD>
<TE>   "It was very stupid," Maher said. Pinching his nose and bowing his
head, he added: "I will have to live with this daily for the rest of
my life.... It was a terrible accident, that's all it was. A terrible
accident for which I share my part of the responsibility. I never
wanted to hurt Safra."</TE>
<TE>   Maher, 44, could face a maximum sentence of life in prison if
convicted of arson that led to the deaths of two people.</TE>
<TE>   He testified that he started the fire, then stabbed himself --
convinced he would emerge the hero who rushed his employer to safety
while fending off attackers. Safra and Torrente suffocated in the
smoke-filled bathroom where they sought refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Rescuers were slow in responding to the smoke alarm, Maher
testified. The defense contends that police stopped firefighters from
entering the building, believing two intruders were still inside.</TE>
<TE>   Maher, a former Green Beret, helped care for Safra, who suffered
from Parkinson's disease.</TE>

<HD>Head of Afghan Multinational Force Warns of Attacks if Iraq
Is Invaded</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>War on Iraq could trigger terror attacks on the 4,800-strong
international force maintaining security in Afghanistan, the unit's
Turkish commander said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "The only thing I can say is that if there is any Iraq operation,
it means terrorist attacks against ISAF may start," Maj. Gen. Akin
Zorlu said.</LD>
<LD>   "This is my concern and the concern of other commanders" in the
International Security Assistance Force. Zorlu was visiting to report
to U.S. officials, including Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D.
Wolfowitz, as Turkey prepares to relinquish command of the security
force Dec. 20 after six months. He said he told Wolfowitz that aid to
the Afghans should be increased without delay.</LD>
<TE>   Zorlu said he expected Germany and the Netherlands to take over
when Turkey's mandate ends, but whether that happens on schedule was
up to political leaders. He said there have been preliminary
discussions with the Germans.</TE>
<TE>   The Turkish contingent in Afghanistan numbers 1,400, the largest
in the international force of 22 countries that operates in and
around Kabul, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey, NATO's only predominantly Muslim member, agreed to take
command of the force in return for U.S. pledges of financial aid and
military equipment. Zorlu said the security in Kabul is improving
daily despite threats from remnants of the Al Qaeda terrorist
network. "The crime rates are lower than similar-sized Western
cities," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The night curfew was lifted for the first time in 23 years on
Nov. 3, and so far there has been no indication of any crime
increase."</TE>

<HD>Bill to Offer Asylum to Iraqi Scientists Dies in Congress</HD>
<DH>Red tape killed the measure, which was aimed at helping
U.N. weapons inspectors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A bipartisan effort to strengthen the hand of U.N. inspectors by
offering hundreds of Iraqi scientists U.S. residency in exchange for
information on weapons programs died Friday when Congress adjourned
without passing the bill.</LD>
<LD>   Without the legislation, inspectors will be able to take
scientists out of Iraq to question them about chemical, biological
and nuclear programs but will be unable to offer them asylum in
return for their cooperation.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) sponsored the bill after former
U.N. inspectors said they believed they could have uncovered more
information about Iraqi nuclear and chemical weapons programs had
they been able to offer safe haven to Iraqi scientists.</LD>
<TE>   Though there was no real political opposition to it, the "Safe
Haven for Iraqi Scientists" bill bogged down in legislative red tape.</TE>
<TE>   First the Republican House leadership attached it to a complex
bill on Zuni Indian water rights. Extricated, the measure expired
Friday as House members stampeded for their districts to end the
lame-duck session of the 107th Congress. The Senate passed it by
unanimous consent Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters said they hoped the legislation would be passed when
the 108th Congress convenes in January.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got 500 green cards in the right hands, it would be a
tremendous help in terms of disabling the program and gaining
insights into the program," said David Kay, who was chief U.N.
weapons inspector after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. "In the nuclear
area, if I could take 25 people out of the country and I could choose
which 25, I could create tremendous disruption in the program."</TE>
<TE>   From 1991 until 1998, when the inspectors left the country, the
Iraqi regime used a variety of techniques to try to intimidate both
Iraqi scientists and the inspectors, U.N. officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi officials told Kay that two of the scientists he had
interviewed were subsequently executed for "making mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraqis told me [about the scientists] because they thought
that would make me less vigorous" in pressing other witnesses for
details about weapons secrets, Kay said.</TE>
<TE>   Routinely, Iraqi government minders attended U.N. interviews with
scientists and sometimes videotaped them. They frequently coached the
interview subjects or interrupted the interviews to "remind" the
witnesses on sensitive issues, weapons inspectors have said.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. inspectors have the technology to set up "silent rooms" in
Baghdad that would be immune to electronic eavesdropping, but
convincing frightened Iraqis that their words cannot be overheard by
their government is no easy task, Kay said.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to avoid intimidation and protect scientists willing to
cooperate, the U.S. government insisted that the U.N. Security
Council resolution that sent inspectors back into Baghdad give chief
weapons inspector Hans Blix the authority to interview anyone
anywhere at any time, and to take witnesses and their families out of
Iraq for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   But Biden argues that scientists would have little incentive to
tell the truth, even abroad, if they knew they would be sent back to
Iraq to face possible reprisals.</TE>
<TE>   Blix has expressed reservations about interviewing witnesses
abroad, saying it would be difficult if the Iraqi regime did not
cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials ask what would happen if, for example, Iraqi
security forces claim the U.N. is kidnapping scientists for
interrogation or attempt to prevent inspectors from leaving with the
witnesses?</TE>
<TE>   "What happens if the Iraqis lay siege to our compound? What if
they intercept the jeep [carrying the scientists] on the way to the
airport?" asked Blix spokesman Ewen Buchanan. And what if the
information provided by such witnesses once they and their families
have left the country turns out to be deliberately false or simply
wrong? Buchanan asked. Would they be sent back to Baghdad?</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, we will be exploring further in what ways we can use the
authorities given to us by the [Security Council], but the
practicalities of doing it need to be further examined," Buchanan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Under existing U.S. law, foreign informants may be brought to the
United States, but the program is limited to 100 people per year,
including families. Given the large size of many Iraqi families, and
the need to offer asylum to spies and whistle-blowers from other
parts of the world, Biden deemed that number inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   Dangling up to 500 U.S. green cards in front of Iraqis with the
promise of their families' being brought to America, could also
prompt a flood of fakers claiming to be nuclear scientists with vital
information, Kay and Buchanan said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Kay said, Blix understands that any promise to take an
Iraqi's family along must be made with great caution. "He may be
taking the village or the town," Kay said. And some Iraqis may later
wish to return to their homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these issues, the Biden bill won bipartisan support. It
was co-sponsored by Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) and endorsed by
President Bush. The White House even made calls of support after the
two senators agreed to changes that would give the CIA and the
attorney general power to approve the grants of residency and that
would require recipients to give the U.S. government -- not just the
U.N. -- "critical and reliable information" on Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>

<HD>Oil Smothers Spanish Villages' Livelihoods</HD>
<DH>Fish-dependent region watches spill with dread in what
should be the most lucrative season. Many doubt promises of
government aid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey Fleishman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAION, Spain</DL>
<LD>The oil slicks, one of them 20 miles long, are sinister. They move at
the whim of the elements, their directions shifting in strong winds
and high waves. The villages here on the Galician coast can't predict
when or where the next spill from the sunken tanker will wash in. So
they watch, and wait. It is a tedious vigil, even for a region that
for centuries has tied its fate to the cruel uncertainties of the
seas.</LD>
<LD>   Just beyond the cove, where the waves slam into the cliffs, Ramon
Rodriguez Vazquez stares out toward the gooey mess keeping him from
his tiny treasure.</LD>
<LD>   It is low tide and Vazquez should be in the mist, crawling between
the sea and the rocks and filling his bucket with percebe barnacles,
a thumb-sized Spanish seafood delicacy. But his bucket is at home and
his callused hands are stuffed in his trousers, and all he can do is
commiserate with the other guys about the oil rolling in with the
tide, fouling the beaches and spattering the promenade lights.</LD>
<TE>   "Eighty percent of the people here are tied to the ocean," he
said. "We are very worried."</TE>
<TE>   The tanker Prestige that broke apart and sank in rough seas
earlier this week has smeared 250 miles of coastline with about
15,000 tons of oil and kept 1,000 fishermen and shellfish harvesters
off the water. The coastal towns don't know whether the other 65,000
tons of oil that sank with the vessel will resurface and ooze toward
them.</TE>
<TE>   The disaster is spoiling the approaching holiday season, when
northern Spanish fishermen usually triple their incomes because of
increased demand for mussels, sardines, mackerel and cod.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be no Christmas," said Angela Franco, sitting in a
cafe near a picture of Caion's patron saint, the Virgin of Miracles.
"Our people live out of the sea. What will happen in the summer? The
tourists won't come. No seafood, no tourists. We cleaned the beach
two days ago. Today, it's disgusting again. It will be like this for
months."</TE>
<TE>   Four oil slicks whipped by 55-mph winds are streaming toward the
cape of Estaca de Bares north of Caion. Spanish authorities said
emergency crews had laid 34,000 yards of floating barriers to block
the oil from reaching rivers and streams near several towns and the
Corrubedo wildlife refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Spain has asked France to deploy a ship with sophisticated
underwater technology to survey the sunken tanker, which sits 133
miles off the coast at a depth of 14,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Portuguese officials reported on Friday that a new spill had
appeared near where the Prestige went down. This would indicate that
some of the entombed oil was leaking from the single-hull vessel. The
Spanish government said the spill was most likely part of an earlier
slick, adding that scientists believe the cargo has solidified in the
deep, frigid waters.</TE>
<TE>   The Caion fishermen's headquarters is a sullen place. Men fill out
forms and stand in line on newspapers so their oily boots won't stain
the floor. The regional government will give each fisherman $900 a
month -- in December, most would have earned triple that.</TE>
<TE>   The national government, which has closed those 250 miles of
fishing waters, announced a $200-million aid package Friday to
subsidize some of the industry's losses.</TE>
<TE>   "My crew is doing what I'm doing, crossing my arms and waiting,"
said Evaristo Lareo Vinas, president of the Caion Fishermen's Assn.,
whose 27-ton sardine trawler is docked. "We cannot lose strength."</TE>
<TE>   Most people in Caion won't believe that the national government
money is coming until they fold it into their wallets. Spanish
authorities made similar promises in December 1992, when at least
70,000 tons of crude oil leaked from a tanker and spoiled Caion's
fishing waters. Aid checks never showed up for most fishermen, and
some think it's hubris for the government to make another pledge.</TE>
<TE>   "Promises, promises," Franco said. "This is the fourth oil spill
in 20 years, and the government takes 10 years to pay, and with no
interest."</TE>
<TE>   Angry fishermen throughout the region blame Madrid for not better
protecting the coast from single-hull tankers, which are prone to
accidents. Government officials said the Prestige -- a 26-year-old
vessel -- had been cited at least three times for safety violations
in ports around the world. Spain is suing the owners and jailed the
captain for negligence shortly after the ship's hull cracked in
stormy seas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so bad we can't even fish off the rocks," said Justo
Iglesias Freire, a retired fishing boat captain. He chewed on a
toothpick as he stood along the cove, where a dozen boats have been
dry-docked near scattered nets and lobster traps. The scent of fish
and brine was overpowered by the metallic tang of oil, and just
behind Freire, a rainbow bent over a beach and rocky inlet that were
stained black.</TE>
<TE>   "We're eating beef and frozen stuff," said Freire's buddy, Antonio
Fuentes Iglesias.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I do miss eating fish," Freire said. "This is the worst
disaster to hit us."</TE>
<TE>   Up the hill from the cove, and through the town square, past the
Church of Perpetual Help, where the scent of new pine pews sweetened
the oil stench, the ocean spread out under low hanging clouds.</TE>
<TE>   Three hundred yards away, draped in yellow and green slickers and
wearing high rubber boots, volunteers raked and shoveled oily goo
that ran long, crooked fingers through the sand.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to clean," said Sandra Ramos, a landscaper
for city hall, her rubber gear lying in a black mess at her feet.
"The stuff is heavy and the tide takes it out and brings it back in,
and it's like you have to start from scratch all over again. This
will affect us all for a very long time. I feel sad looking at it."</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Fernandez Bardanca is fast in her cafe. She serves beans,
cranks out espressos and keeps the red wine ready for the older guys.
She clatters. She also rushes across the town square, delivering
coffee to the butcher and to the men filling out forms at the
fishermen's association. She has never worked on the sea, yet her
strong hands could cast most any net.</TE>
<TE>   But when things are bad on the sea, things tend to go bad in
Bardanca's cafe. Her customers have already tightened spending, and
she worries that if this fishing village has to import its fish, her
prices will rise and her regulars might not be so regular.</TE>
<TE>   "The village people want to save their money," she said. "They
don't trust they'll get financial help from the government.... I feel
like crying."</TE>
<TE>   On the promenade, flecked with clumps of blackened-seaweed and
slippery from a lingering oil mist, Evaristo Lareo Leal leaned over
the railing and spoke to his wife, Josefa, about the damage done.</TE>
<TE>   Leal had fished the seas for 50 years, starting when he was 11.
There had been adventure. Josefa knew the coast well too. When she
was a young mother, she daily balanced a basket of fish -- "50 kilos,
it was," or 110 pounds -- on her head and walked for miles until
every sardine and anchovy was sold.</TE>
<TE>   "It destroyed my bones," said Josefa, deep wrinkles on her face, a
shawl wrapped around her shoulders. "Look out there -- I've never
seen anything like it."</TE>
<TE>   "There'll be more coming this way," said her husband, leaning on
his cane.</TE>
<TE>   "The currents go north and south. The winds move, they're coming
from everywhere. Now, they're coming toward us and it could stay that
way for days.... We don't know what the future brings."</TE>

<HD>Top-Scoring Oak Park District to Lose Leader</HD>
<DH>The superintendent will join a Redlands company that helps
struggling schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The superintendent of Ventura County's highest-performing school
district will leave her post next year for a job helping struggling
campuses nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   Marilyn Lippiatt, who has headed Oak Park Unified School District
for a decade, announced she will resign in March to join a Redlands
firm that provides educational services to schools in California and
across the country.</LD>
<LD>   "I have no reason to leave," Lippiatt said. "But this was a new
challenge that came along, and new opportunities to make a
difference."</LD>
<TE>   Lippiatt, 60, said she will also receive a "healthy raise" when
she joins the Pulliam Group, compared with her $134,000-a-year salary
in Oak Park.</TE>
<TE>   On her watch, affluent Oak Park's five campuses have consistently
outperformed their peers in the county and the state on achievement
tests, from the Stanford 9 to the California High School Exit Exam.
It's a notable achievement, said Ventura County Supt. of Schools
Charles Weis.</TE>
<TE>   "It was always a well-performing district, but what's interesting
is that they have continued to go up each year," Weis said. "They've
been pushing the edge on modern and new curriculum every year."</TE>
<TE>   Oak Park is a small, upscale district -- there are just 3,600
students and only 0.7% are poor enough to be eligible for free
lunches. But Lippiatt said some of the district's strategies can be
used to help poor-performing schools elsewhere, and she hopes to use
them in her new job.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done some things in Oak Park that are not exclusive to Oak
Park, and that can be shared," Lippiatt said. "These are not
high-priced items; they are subtle reforms and changes."</TE>
<TE>   For example, she said, a decision to yield more power to
principals at each school -- rather than send out mandates from the
district office -- has produced more innovative programs and higher
achievement.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, for instance, Oak Park High School changed its
schedule to add a "student support" period at the end of the day, in
which students could meet with their teachers for extra help.</TE>
<TE>   "They worked as a high school to do that, and it has reaped
phenomenal results," Lippiatt said.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Moore, principal at Oak Park, credited Lippiatt's leadership
for his school's success.</TE>
<TE>   "She does a lot of work behind the scenes that a lot of people
don't see," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   Of her achievements during her tenure, Lippiatt is most proud of
those changes she made to the district's administration that will
remain after she leaves. "The changes are permanent," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lippiatt came to Oak Park in 1993 after eight years as executive
director of the California School Leadership Center for the Central
Coast region. Her teaching career began in public schools in Los
Angeles, where she grew up.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, she taught in Thousand Oaks elementary schools, where
she was also a principal. She will continue to live in Agoura Hills
with her husband, Tom.</TE>

<HD>Boy Denies Seeing Mom Beaten</HD>
<DH>He testifies in civil court that he spent the day and
evening with his father, who is accused of attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peering over the witness stand, a 12-year-old Westlake Village boy
testified Friday that he never saw his father brutally beat his
mother with a flashlight during a custody dispute three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Maxx Mannheimer, an articulate curly haired middle-school student,
contradicted the story given to police by his mother and backed up
the account given in court this week by his father.</LD>
<LD>   The boy was called as a witness during the civil trial between his
divorced parents, Linda Morrisset and Lee Mannheimer, who sued each
other after she accused him of trying to kill her Sept. 11, 1999.</LD>
<TE>   A housekeeper found Morrisset lying in a pool of blood in the
hallway of her Santa Rosa Valley home on the morning of Sept. 12.
Four blunt strike marks were found near her head on the wood floor.</TE>
<TE>   After coming out of a two-week coma, Morrisset told detectives her
enraged ex-husband had attacked her with a heavy metal flashlight
during a dispute over where their son was supposed to spend the
night.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer, 59, a Westlake Village businessman, was arrested on
suspicion of attempted murder but released after prosecutors found
too little evidence to file criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   He later sued his ex-wife for slander and other civil claims,
which were dropped a few days before this trial.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset, 51, a former accountant who is now partially paralyzed
and uses a wheelchair, sued Mannheimer for assault, battery and
infliction of emotional distress. Her attorney, Allen Ball, spent the
last week presenting evidence to support those claims. He rested his
case late Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer's attorney, Greg Ramirez, opened his case by calling
the boy to the stand. He denied witnessing the near-fatal attack on
his mother, saying he spent the day with his father.</TE>
<TE>   He said they visited friends in Studio City that evening and then
went to Mannheimer's house in Westlake Village. The boy said he did
not go to his mother's home that night, as she contends.</TE>
<TE>   He said the next day his mom did not pick him up as planned. A day
later, he said, his father told him that she had been attacked and
badly hurt.</TE>
<TE>   In subsequent days and weeks, Ventura County Sheriff's Department
detectives investigating the incident interviewed her son several
times.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez asked the boy whether his mother also talked to him about
it.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me that she picked me up and I was there and I saw it,"
Maxx responded. "I told her I wasn't there, and I didn't see it."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's testimony, including cross-examination by Ball, is
scheduled to resume Dec. 3.</TE>

<HD>Move Trial, Say Lawyers for Sanchez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawyers for Simi Valley serial rapist Vincent Sanchez asked a judge
Friday to move his upcoming murder trial to another county because of
publicity surrounding the high-profile case.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, 32, is charged with first-degree murder in the shooting
death of 20-year-old college student Megan Barroso. He allegedly used
a high-powered assault rifle and took aim as she drove home from a
friend's house last year.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors, who contend that Sanchez killed Barroso during a
kidnap and rape attempt, are seeking the death penalty in the trial
scheduled for Jan. 13. Sanchez has admitted killing Barroso but
denies that he tried to rape her. He has also pleaded guilty to
raping seven women between 1996 and 2001.</LD>
<TE>   In August, defense attorneys and prosecutors polled hundreds of
prospective jurors to determine their knowledge of the case. Defense
lawyers say their results show that media coverage has tainted the
jury pool in Ventura County and are asking Superior Court Judge Ken
Riley to move the trial.</TE>
<TE>   But Ventura County prosecutors say fair and impartial jurors can
be found locally.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, prosecution witness Ebbe B. Ebbesen, a professor of
psychology at UC San Diego, testified that the survey results are
flawed and that jurors are not as familiar with the case as defense
lawyers contend.</TE>

<LD>   A deal to be considered Tuesday by the City Council would
construct a $12-million theater and erect about 10 shops, bookstores
and restaurants around it, potentially ending a seven-year effort to
revive the moribund downtown.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to be beautiful," Mayor Pro Tem John Zaragoza said.
"It will be something that will tremendously help downtown business."</LD>
<TE>   Developer Dave White, a principal partner in the new Strand Cinema
corporation, said Friday that he had struck a deal with city
redevelopment officials after six months of negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   He said the movie theater complex is the first phase of a vast
project that could transform the entire downtown area over the next
10 years into a bustling shopping and entertainment zone titled the
International Marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   After the theater and shops are built over the next 18 months
between A and B streets, facing the city's landmark Plaza Park, White
said his group plans to build a second set of 10 shops on the same
parcel. Once those shops are leased, the plan calls for the
development of stores, offices and restaurants all playing off the
International Marketplace theme.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you're going to see a radical change in people's opinions
of downtown Oxnard," White said. "It's going to be the place to be in
Ventura County. The city's already started a big transition."</TE>
<TE>   White has played a role in those changes. He is a partner in both
the 416-home River Ridge golf course expansion in north Oxnard and
the $750-million RiverPark project, the largest mixed-use development
in Ventura County history.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, city residents have heard the same story before about
promising downtown projects.</TE>
<TE>   A city theater deal last year with Burbank developer Victor
Georgino fell through after neither side would agree to pick up an
extra $1.8 million in costs because builders were required to hire
workers at the so-called prevailing wage, not the lowest possible
wage for labor.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third deal since 1995 to go nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Zaragoza said that this time both the developers and the city have
arrived at a financially balanced agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have more of a vested interest [from the developer], and
it's a lot harder for developers to walk away," Zaragoza said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike previous deals in which developers would have gotten the
theater site for free, White said he and his partners have agreed to
buy the site--nearly one square block--for $800,000. They will pay
the city another $1 million over time.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, the city must soon build a 350-space downtown parking
garage at an estimated cost of $4 million to $5 million. The city
must also guarantee the $1.35-million-a-year lease payments of movie
theater operator San Carlos Cinemas for 25 years, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   White said San Carlos Cinemas is a medium-sized company with
theaters across the state.</TE>
<TE>   The Strand Theater will be built by the developers, using a
$12-million bank loan, White said. "The city is not throwing in
anything as far as a cash investment in the theater," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's the most populous city in Ventura County, Oxnard has
no first-run theater. On nights and weekends, Oxnard movie fans spend
their money at theaters a few miles away in Ventura and Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the city loses out on potential property taxes from
theater owners and sales tax from theater customers.</TE>
<TE>   Even without a theater, city officials have taken steps in recent
years to begin reviving the downtown area. There is a new red-brick
library, a matching train station and new landscaping and lighting
projects.</TE>
<TE>   During the day, Oxnard is a bustling town center. But at night,
residents have described it as a "ghost town."</TE>
<TE>   "After six or seven years of negotiations, I'm delighted that
we've reached this point," said City Atty. Gary Gillig.</TE>
<TE>   "What really excites me," he said, "is this could be a cornerstone
for the whole International Marketplace. We've got vacant buildings
downtown. We've got to get people down there somehow."</TE>

<HD>Doctor Is Acquitted in 5 Patients' Deaths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FARMINGTON, Utah</DL>
<LD>A psychiatrist was found not guilty Friday of manslaughter and
negligent homicide in the deaths of five ailing, elderly patients.</LD>
<LD>   It took jurors just 90 minutes to acquit Robert Weitzel, who
prosecutors alleged deliberately weakened the patients before they
were killed with morphine overdoses.</LD>
<LD>   Weitzel maintained he was providing comfort care to terminally ill
patients. Defense witnesses testified his treatment was within
standard medical practices.</LD>
<TE>   "I am very glad this trial is finally over and that compassionate,
end-of-life care has been vindicated," Weitzel said in a statement.
"I'm also terribly saddened by the unnecessary suffering that my
patients' families were put through."</TE>
<TE>   Weitzel was found guilty in an earlier trial, but a judge threw
out the conviction because prosecutors failed to disclose an expert
witness who thought Weitzel did nothing criminally wrong.</TE>
<TE>   In closing arguments Friday, Davis County Atty. Mel Wilson
complained the defense had turned the case into a forum on
end-of-life care.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the defendant who brought them to the dying condition," he
said, adding that the case was about "an attitude of arrogance ...
[and] indifference, a betrayal of trust."</TE>
<TE>   Expert witnesses for both sides offered contradictory testimony
about how much morphine was too much for frail, elderly patients.</TE>
<TE>   The five, ages 72 to 90, all had dementia, and four had serious
physical ailments, according to testimony. "These people were at the
end of their lives," Weitzel's trial attorney Walter Bugden Jr. said.</TE>
<TE>   Weitzel pleaded guilty last year to prescription fraud for keeping
some of the morphine and Demerol he prescribed to two patients.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The husband of a woman who has been in a vegetative state for 12
years can disconnect her feeding tube and let her die, a judge ruled
in a long-running case pitting the man against his in-laws.</LD>
<LD>   Circuit Judge George W. Greer said the tube supplying nourishment
to Terri Schiavo, 38, would be removed on Jan. 3. The judge said the

<HD>House Adjourns for Year Without Extending Jobless Benefits</HD>
<DH>Democrats threatened to hold up homeland security bill over
the issue, then relented.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congress adjourned for the year Friday without extending jobless
benefits that will soon lapse for about 1 million people, but it did
send President Bush the bill merging 22 agencies into a new Homeland
Security Department.</LD>
<LD>   By a voice vote of the few lawmakers around, the House completed
action on the security bill by approving technical changes the Senate
had made. That nailed down a victory for Bush, who plans to sign the
measure Monday and nominate Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge to
head the Cabinet-level department.</LD>
<LD>   Bush plans to sign a bill Tuesday creating a federal role in
insuring property against destruction by terrorists. On Wednesday, he
will sign legislation establishing an independent commission to
investigate how the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks occurred and paving
the way for big spending increases for intelligence agencies.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats fleetingly threatened to delay passage of the homeland
security bill until next week. They said the 107th Congress should
not leave town without helping laid-off workers facing the expiration
of federal unemployment compensation starting Dec. 28.</TE>
<TE>   "Congress is here insisting on playing Scrooge at Christmastime
when we ought to be showing a little mercy," said Rep. David R. Obey
(D-Wis.).</TE>
<TE>   The Republican-run House voted last week to keep paying the
benefits until as late as Feb. 2, while the Democratic-led Senate
approved a version extending them to at least March 29. Senators of
both parties offered a scaled-down compromise this week to House GOP
lawmakers, who refused to consider it.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas), who is retiring, said
the GOP-controlled 108th Congress will take the matter up when it
convenes in January. Armey spokesman Greg Crist said lawmakers may
discuss providing extra benefits to make up for lost weeks of
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Last March, Congress created a 13-week extension in federal
jobless benefits for laid-off workers who have used up the maximum 26
weeks of coverage they generally receive from states.</TE>
<TE>   That 13-week extension starts expiring Dec. 28, when an estimated
820,000 people will lose coverage. Each week 95,000 more will follow.</TE>
<TE>   Traveling with Bush to Russia, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer
tried to distance the president from the issue, refusing six times to
state Bush's position on extending benefits. "The House and the
Senate have to get something done in order for the president to have
something to sign," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats said they didn't block approval of the homeland security
bill because Republicans could have called the House into session
next week and passed it while still refusing to extend jobless
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   But many Democrats were reluctant to slow the security measure.
Many of them attribute their party's Nov. 5 election losses to their
earlier opposition to the bill on the grounds that it would diminish
the workplace rights of the new agency's 170,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the lapsing of the benefits could provide Democrats
with holiday fodder to accuse the GOP of treating working people
unfairly.</TE>
<TE>   "Once people are thrown out of their benefits, it will become a
still more vivid issue," said Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.).</TE>
<TE>   Ridge said Bush's choice to lead the newly approved department is
"probably the worst kept secret" in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm honored to serve the president in the present capacity and
will be glad to serve the president wherever he thinks I can do him
and the country the most good," Ridge said in California, where he
met with the Republican Governors Assn.</TE>

<HD>Two Cruise Lines Now Affected by Stomach Virus</HD>
<DH>Disney scours ship after 100 fall ill, while the cause of
the outbreak aboard the Amsterdam remains a mystery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>About 100 people aboard a Disney cruise ship have contracted an
unidentified, highly contagious stomach ailment, officials said
Friday, as another Caribbean passenger liner underwent intensive
cleaning following a similar outbreak.</LD>
<LD>   "We can't confirm what it is aboard the Disney ship, or the
cause," said Bernadette Burden, spokeswoman of the national Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. CDC inspectors, Burden
said, will board the Disney Magic when it docks today at Port
Canaveral, Fla., at the end of a weeklong cruise.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle-based Holland America has scratched the next 10-day voyage
of the 780-foot Amsterdam while it is steam-cleaned and disinfected.
During its last four voyages, including one that ended Thursday, more
than 500 passengers and crew have become infected with what public
health officials say is a Norwalk-like stomach virus.</LD>
<TE>   Burden said such an outbreak is not unique to cruise ships. "It
can occur in other venues, other areas where large numbers of people
congregate, like a Boy Scout jamboree, a hotel, a train," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In August, another Holland America vessel, the Ryndam, was
temporarily pulled from service on the line's Alaska route after an
outbreak of Norwalk-like virus. On previous voyages, almost 400
passengers and crew members reported symptoms of gastrointestinal
illness, the CDC said.</TE>
<TE>   CDC inspectors have found the Amsterdam's food and water to be
uncontaminated, Burden said Friday, so one likely scenario is that an
infected person boarded the ship and transmitted the virus to others.
The CDC spokeswoman said it hadn't been determined whether the
original carrier was a crew member, port worker or passengers on each
of the last four cruises. On those voyages, a total of 524 passengers
and members of the Amsterdam's crew contracted the stomach virus.</TE>
<TE>   The disease, so named because it is similar to a viral strain
first identified 30 years ago in Norwalk, Ohio, is potent enough to
be caught through a sneeze, a cough or contact with a ship's handrail
that has been touched by a sick person. But the spread of the germ
can be greatly limited by simple, thorough hand washing, CDC
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Elvejord, a Holland America spokesman, said sick passengers
were offered various amounts of compensation, with those who broke
off their holiday and flew home getting a full refund of the cost of
the cruise, free airfare and a 25% credit toward a future cruise.
Litigation, though, seemed likely: Already on Nov. 15, a lawsuit on
behalf of stricken passengers was filed in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   One woman on the Amsterdam, Connie Woodcock, sent a dispatch while
the ship was at sea last weekend to the Toronto Sun newspaper.
Because of worries about transmitting the virus, the captain stopped
shaking hands with guests at his cocktail parties, Woodcock said. The
hot tubs were drained, salt and pepper shakers were removed, and
waiters wore plastic gloves.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Jaronski, a spokesman for the Disney line, said intensive
cleaning began aboard the Disney Magic on Thursday morning after the
passengers fell sick. It was the first large-scale outbreak in the
line's four-year history, Jaronski said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're deep-cleaning and disinfecting carpeting, linen,
bedspreads, the air-conditioning, all common areas," the Disney line
official said. Staterooms of sick passengers have been scrubbed, and
at the on-board buffets, crew members dish out salad and other food,
rather than letting passengers serve themselves.</TE>
<TE>   When the ship, which can carry 2,600 paying guests, docks at Port
Canaveral today, cleaning teams, microbiologists and other workers
will board to continue the scrubbing and sanitizing. The plan is to
send the ship out on its next cruise later the same day, Jaronski
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We will most definitely be delayed tomorrow, and we will not
leave tomorrow if we are not satisfied with how things went," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The company has been calling all passengers booked on the next
cruise to give them the options of rescheduling or canceling with a
full refund, Jaronski said. Any compensation for customers who became
ill will be determined on a case-by-case basis, he said.</TE>

<HD>DNA Test Ordered in Tennessee Death Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>A divided federal appeals court Friday ordered the Tennessee Supreme
Court to review the case of a condemned killer to consider DNA
evidence that could clear him.</LD>
<LD>   In a 6-5 ruling, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals also asked
the state court to consider whether the death penalty is still an
appropriate punishment in the case.</LD>
<LD>   Paul G. House, 40, was convicted and sentenced to death for
killing Carolyn Muncey in 1985.</LD>
<TE>   Muncey's children said she left the house after a man told her
that her husband had been in a car wreck.</TE>
<TE>   Her battered body was found at the bottom of a wooded embankment
near her rural home.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court said DNA evidence found on Muncey's body --
attributed at trial to House, based on a blood test -- matched the
victim's husband. DNA-matching technology wasn't available during
House's trial.</TE>
<TE>   The 6th Circuit majority also said that since the trial, two
independent witnesses testified that Muncey's husband admitted he was
the killer.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argued at trial that House raped Muncey, citing semen
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court said DNA evidence has now "conclusively shown"
the semen was not House's, raising questions about the evidence
jurors relied on in making their decision.</TE>

<HD>JFK Film Will Be Digitally Restored</HD>
<DH>Meanwhile, museum in Dallas acquires new photos, footage
linked to the assassination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the three primary films of the assassination of President
Kennedy is being restored, its owners said Friday, the 39th
anniversary of his death.</LD>
<LD>   The Muchmore film, as it is known, will be remastered with digital
technology that will stabilize it and restore scratched and damaged
images, Associated Press Television News said in London.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, the Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas said it has acquired
new photographs and film, including footage of the presidential
motorcade not previously shown to the public.</LD>
<TE>   The APTN film was taken by Marie Muchmore as the president's
motorcade turned onto Houston Street in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   It shows the last, fatal shot to the head and a woman who came to
be known as the "babushka lady" filming near the president's car. She
never was conclusively identified nor was her film ever retrieved.</TE>
<TE>   Muchmore's film, originally acquired by United Press
International, is now part of the library of APTN, which commissioned
the restoration. It will be released in January for inclusion in
productions timed for the 40th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   "If a program maker is using scratched, washed-out images, then
viewers aren't going to be giving their full concentration, so we
think it's a way of helping to tell the story," said Christopher
O'Hearn, the head of content development for APTN.</TE>
<TE>   The Sixth Floor Museum, meanwhile, said it had acquired footage by
Jackie Tindel that shows Kennedy's motorcade minutes before the
assassination.</TE>
<TE>   Maureen Hughes-Thompson also donated well-known film taken by her
late husband, Robert Hughes, showing the motorcade in Dealey Plaza
and the assassination scene afterward. Movement can be seen in the
sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository, from where
Lee Harvey Oswald fired a rifle at the motorcade.</TE>
<TE>   Among 20 photographs donated by Jay Skaggs are two that show
Police Lt. Carl Day carrying a rifle from the book depository after
the assassination. The museum said the photos are the only known
color photographs of the event.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, National Public Radio and CNN were airing two sets of
taped radio communications the day of the assassination.</TE>
<TE>   One was between the White House and a plane over the Pacific
carrying Cabinet officers, the other between Washington and officials
returning to the capital with Lyndon B. Johnson, who was sworn in as
president aboard Air Force One.</TE>

<HD>Probe of Los Alamos Lab Losses Widens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANTA FE, N.M.</DL>
<LD>An investigation into allegations of financial wrongdoing and
cover-ups at Los Alamos National Laboratory has expanded to include
additional purchases made by lab employees, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "The university will not tolerate theft or mismanagement at Los
Alamos or in any other part of the university," University of
California President Richard Atkinson said in a statement issued by
the laboratory.</LD>
<LD>   The University of California operates the nuclear weapons
laboratory for the Department of Energy.</LD>
<TE>   Atkinson said the widening investigation into business practices
at the lab includes "the inappropriate use of purchase cards,
allegations of criminal activities involving the laboratory
purchasing system, and improprieties involving property management."</TE>
<TE>   Recent published reports based on internal documents provided
anonymously -- purportedly by lab employees -- have cited millions of
dollars in missing inventory.</TE>
<TE>   The Albuquerque Journal reported Sunday that, based on the
internal documents, nearly $3 million worth of items disappeared or
were reported missing from the lab from 1999 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The statement issued by the lab said the figure was too high
because 1998 and 1999 were combined. Lab spokeswoman Linn Tytler also
said items listed as lost are sometimes recovered in the same year
they're reported missing.</TE>
<TE>   Whistle-blowers allege that laboratory leaders have tried to cover
up the problems and interfere with investigations.</TE>

<HD>Rabbi Spared Death Penalty in Contract Slaying of Wife</HD>
<DH>N.J. man gets 30 years to life and insists he loved the
woman he paid two men to kill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>FREEHOLD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Invoking biblical imagery and begging a jury to keep him alive, a
philandering New Jersey rabbi on Friday received a sentence of 30
years to life for the brutal murder-for-hire of his wife.</LD>
<LD>   Fred J. Neulander -- who is believed to be the first American
rabbi to be convicted of a capital crime -- was spared the death
penalty when jurors could not agree unanimously on such a punishment.</LD>
<LD>   The once-prominent religious leader was convicted this week of
orchestrating his wife's death so he could continue an affair with a
Philadelphia radio show host. He looked stoic as the jury's decision
was read, as he had for much of the four-week trial in central New
Jersey.</LD>
<TE>   Yet the rabbi appeared to stun many in the courtroom when he
insisted that he still had a profound love for Carol Neulander, the
woman he paid two men $30,000 to kill.</TE>
<TE>   Neulander, 61, had declined to testify in his trial, but he spoke
for 20 minutes Friday during the allocution. As the room fell silent,
the rabbi talked in the same comforting tones he had used many times
before at bar mitzvahs, weddings and funerals. He vowed that he could
make valuable contributions to society by teaching inmates to read.</TE>
<TE>   "I am here to offer a plea for my life," he said quietly, sitting
in a witness chair and facing the jury.</TE>
<TE>   It was a stunning fall from grace for a man who, along with his
wife, co-founded M'Kor Shalom in Cherry Hill, N.J., one of the
state's largest Reform congregations. Neulander's friends and
supporters were grief-stricken when Carol Neulander was found beaten
to death in her living room, but their reaction turned to shock when
police named her husband a prime suspect in her Nov. 1, 1994,
slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators learned that he had several affairs with
congregants, and the case against Neulander came together when Len
Jenoff and Paul Daniels confessed that the rabbi had paid them to
murder his wife. Neulander's first trial, last year, ended in a hung
jury; the retrial was moved by presiding Judge Linda G. Baxter to
Monmouth County to help assure an untainted jury pool.</TE>
<TE>   Neulander's speech was one of the high points of a trial in which
two of his children offered damning testimony. The case featured a
bizarre cast of characters, including an elegant-but-scorned
mistress, a delusional hit man who claimed to be in the CIA, and a
shadowy figure linked to organized crime who said Neulander wanted to
know who he could pay to kill his wife.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, local newspapers revealed that "Miss Vicky"
Lombardi, former wife of the late entertainer Tiny Tim, had become
romantically linked with the rabbi. Veering from the tragic to the
tawdry, the case has held New Jersey spellbound.</TE>
<TE>   As he faced the jury Friday, Neulander began his comments with a
quotation from the book of Genesis. He talked about the importance of
doing "great things" with the days one is allotted on Earth. Alluding
to his affairs, he acknowledged his "reprehensible behavior" toward
his wife. But then the rabbi said that he would sorely miss her,
because "I loved her and I love her. Carol Neulander was a remarkable
woman. Carol Neulander had class."</TE>
<TE>   His comments drew glares from several jurors, and Margaret Miele,
Carol Neulander's sister, wept as he spoke. Clearly irked by
Neulander's statement, prosecutor James P. Lynch addressed it
squarely during his closing arguments to the jurors before they
decided the rabbi's fate.</TE>
<TE>   "You heard him say he loved her and still loves her, but you don't
have to believe that," Lynch said. "You must decide if you believe
him."</TE>
<TE>   One juror, who insisted on remaining anonymous during an interview
on Court TV, said he was bothered by Neulander's profession of love
for his wife. But since his fellow jurors had a variety of opinions
on what might be the best punishment, he said, there was no chance of
a unanimous vote to impose the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have liked him to say more about his three children," the
juror said. "He didn't have much to say about them at all."</TE>
<TE>   After the jury's recommendation was read, one of Neulander's
children voiced rage about his father. Matthew Neulander, who
testified about Rabbi Neulander's cold, detached behavior in the
hours after the murder of his wife, blasted his father's comments
about his mother.</TE>
<TE>   "We know Fred to be arrogant and cold, but his words this morning
were absolutely galling, so maddening, and yet so like him," the son
said. "That he would sit here in the courtroom, a convicted felon,
and then begin to eulogize my mom, this should really tell you the
kind of man he is."</TE>
<TE>   It also shows how deeply the Neulander family has been traumatized
by a mother's death and, now, a father's conviction. A third child,
Benjamin, testified Thursday, asking jurors to spare his father's
life.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a teacher because of him," said the 26-year-old son. "He led
me down an amazing path. And I know that there are other people for
whom he can do that still. Just give him a chance to show he can do
that."</TE>
<TE>   During the trial's penalty phase, Lynch outlined to the jury a
so-called aggravating factor that, under New Jersey law, could result
in the death penalty. In this case, that was the murder-for-hire
offense.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter said she will formally sentence Neulander on Jan. 16.
Jenoff and Daniels, who have already pleaded guilty to aggravated
manslaughter and have cooperated with prosecutors, will be sentenced
a week later. Both men could receive 15 to 30 years in prison.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists have identified a gene that plays a central role in the
development of obesity and diabetes and could pave the way for new
drugs to treat the diseases.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston
discovered that mice genetically prone to obesity or those fed a
high-fat diet had higher activity in a gene called JNK than normal
mice. But animals lacking JNK had less body fat and were less likely
to suffer from insulin-resistance that precedes Type 2, or adult
onset, diabetes.</LD>
<LD>   Gokhan Hotamisligil and his colleagues, who reported the
identification of the gene in this week's issue of Nature, believe it
could work in humans and that blocking its action could form the
basis of new drugs for obesity and diabetes.</LD>

<LD>Minnesota researchers have mapped the genome of the livestock disease
Johne's, an advance that could lead to a greater understanding of a
similar illness in humans, the U.S. Agriculture Department said this
week.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists have debated whether the bovine intestinal disease is
related to the human Crohn's disease because infected animals and
humans suffer similar symptoms -- diarrhea, weight loss and inflamed
digestive tracts. The Johne's bacterium, Mycobacterium
paratuberculosis, is found in some but not all Crohn's patients.</LD>
<LD>   One in every five U.S. herds is believed to be infected with
Johne's, an incurable disease that costs the dairy industry an
estimated $200 million each year. It can infect cattle, sheep, deer
and goats.</LD>
<TE>   The breakthrough means scientists can focus on making an effective
vaccine, USDA microbiologist John P. Bannantine said. Many
veterinarians consider vaccines already on the market unreliable.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new drug designed to stop cancer by cutting off its blood supply
has surprised experts by showing a tumor shrinkage rate unprecedented
for a drug so early in its development.</LD>
<LD>   In the first human trials of the drug, the tumors of one-quarter
of the 23 terminal patients shrank by half or more, researchers
reported this week. Similar drugs have shown great promise in
animals, but proved disappointing in human studies -- prompting no
dramatic tumor shrinkage in their early tests.</LD>
<LD>   Tumors shrank by more than 50% in six of the 23 patients. The
cancer stabilized in five other people. It is rare for a drug to show
more than a 5% regression rate in early human trials, said Dr. Jaap
Verweij of Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</LD>
<TE>   Experts said the new drug attacks from three directions instead of
one. As well as blocking a protein involved in blood vessel growth,
vascular endothelial growth factor, the new drug also interferes with
two other blood vessel growth factors -- basic fibroblast growth
factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Scientists suspect those
enzymes might do more than just support blood vessel growth.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Of all the things that distinguish humans and other primates --
thumbs, the ability to leap and forward-facing eyes -- it was the
ability to grasp that evolved first, researchers reported in this
week's issue of Science.</LD>
<LD>   A 56-million-year-old skeleton found in Wyoming shows that one of
the earliest primate ancestors had an opposable big toe, allowing it
to creep to the outermost branches of trees for nuts and fruit.</LD>
<LD>   It also probably kept a sharp eye out to avoid becoming someone
else's meal. "Now we know that grasping evolved before eyes facing
forward ... and before leaping," said anthropologist Eric Sargis of
Yale University.</LD>
<TE>   The bones of the animal, Carpolestes simpsoni, were preserved in a
limestone block. Unusual for such an old fossil, the tiny foot bones
were almost intact.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police killed a man who had a knife, shot and wounded a
man running with a gun, and fired at but missed a man suspected of
robbery, all in separate incidents Friday that raised the number of
officer-involved shootings in a week to eight, detectives said.</LD>
<LD>   Friday's first incident occurred about 2 a.m. after a woman in the
Westlake area called police to say that her former boyfriend had
forced his way into her third-floor apartment in the 600 block of
Shatto Place and had taken some of her things.</LD>
<LD>   LAPD Sgt. John Pasquariello, a spokesman for the department, said
she directed officers to an apartment down the hall.</LD>
<TE>   "As the door opened, they saw that the suspect had a knife,"
Pasquariello said. "They repeatedly ordered him to drop the knife,
but he advanced toward them, shouting, 'Shoot me! Shoot me!' "</TE>
<TE>   Fearing for their lives, Officers Arthur Bedard and Edwin
Dominguez opened fire, Pasquariello said. The 22-year-old man, whose
name was not released, was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Bedard, 34, is a 13-year LAPD veteran. Dominguez, 37, has been
with the department eight years.</TE>
<TE>   About 10:30 a.m., officers responding to a report of a robbery in
progress at a downtown market saw a man with a pistol standing at
Washington Boulevard and New England Street, Pasquariello said.</TE>
<TE>   "When he advanced toward them with the gun raised, two officers
opened fire," Pasquariello said.</TE>
<TE>   The man fell to the ground, and it was first thought that he had
been wounded, but an examination by paramedics showed he was
uninjured, detectives said.</TE>
<TE>   The unidentified man was being booked on suspicion of armed
robbery and suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, Pasquariello
said.</TE>
<TE>   At 8 p.m. Friday, gang officers were approaching a house on 80th
Street when an 18-year-old armed with a gun ran out, police said.
Officers shot him in the arm.</TE>
<TE>   Other shootings in the last week left two men dead from gunfire,
and two 16-year-old boys were killed when their car struck a tree
after police fired at it.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   The deaths of the youths, Salvador Sibrian and Uriel Damien,
prompted a protest Wednesday by about 50 people who alleged that race
had motivated an officer who fired at the car. Some of the
demonstrators carried placards urging LAPD's new chief, William J.
Bratton, to "control your cops."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, told about the signs, responded: "Control your kids."</TE>
<TE>   Sibrian and Damien died about 1 a.m. Nov. 16, when the car in
which they were riding hit a tree on 53rd Street near Central Avenue
after Officer Tommy Thompson fired at the vehicle. Thompson says he
opened fire after the driver suddenly accelerated toward him. But
Luis Carrillo, a lawyer representing the boys' families, contends the
teenagers were the victims of "trigger-happy police."</TE>
<TE>   Detectives say a car alarm attracted Thompson and his partner to
the car. Thompson's shots wounded Sibrian and Damien, but they died
their deaths were caused by the crash, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, a six-year LAPD veteran, was involved in two previous
shootings, both of which were later ruled justified.</TE>
<TE>   The crash that killed Sibrian and Damien also injured three others
in the car, including the driver, Miguel Lopez, 19. Lopez is being
held at the County-USC Medical Center jail ward on suspicion of
assault with a deadly weapon: the car.</TE>
<TE>   About 7 p.m. Nov. 15, police shot an unidentified man to death in
Wilmington after he allegedly rammed their patrol car with his pickup
truck.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours later, two Wilshire Division officers shot a man running
from a carport where another man had been shot.</TE>
<TE>   Both men, neither of whom has been identified, were seriously
wounded.</TE>
<TE>   About 4 a.m. Nov. 16, officers who witnessed a shooting were fired
upon as they intervened. The officers returned fire, but no one was
hit.</TE>
<TE>   A day later, an officer killed an unarmed car-theft suspect in
South-Central Los Angeles. Detectives said the officer, fearing for
his life, fired one shot at the unidentified man.</TE>

<HD>Ahmanson Project Clears Hurdle</HD>
<DH>Ventura County planners endorse environmental findings for
the proposed mini-city near Calabasas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The controversial Ahmanson Ranch housing project near Calabasas
narrowly passed another key planning review Friday, setting the stage
for a showdown vote before the Ventura County Board of Supervisors
next month.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County planning commissioners voted 3 to 2 to endorse a
new environmental study of the long-delayed project and allow
construction to begin on homes, offices, a school and golf course.</LD>
<LD>   County supervisors hold final authority on the $2-billion
development, and could vote Dec. 10.</LD>
<TE>   As developer Washington Mutual Bank cheered the planning panel's
decision, critics of the proposed mini-city said the split vote was a
weak endorsement, and that they are confident supervisors will find
the environmental study inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   Planning commissioners Bill Bartels, Daryl Reynolds and Chairman
Michael Wesner endorsed the environmental impact report, which
supplemented a 1992 study after discovery of an endangered frog and
plant on the 2,800-acre property three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual has proposed building 3,050 homes on the rolling
hills abutting Ventura County's border with Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "The developers have a right to develop property that they own,"
and there are sufficient regulations to ensure they do so
responsibly, Reynolds said.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that they will do the right thing," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Dissenting after the two-day hearing, commissioners Leo Molitor
and Selma Dressler said they needed more time to analyze the
4,000-page study and accompanying documents.</TE>
<TE>   They expressed concern about the project's effect on traffic and
the recent discovery of the toxic chemical perchlorate in a well near
the project site.</TE>
<TE>   "I really feel I'm being pushed and rushed to make a decision,"
said Molitor, adding that he felt overburdened by 56 pounds of paper
addressing the development.</TE>
<TE>   Dressler said she wanted even more information, adding, "And the
time to get that information is now -- before we turn the shovel."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the project suspect perchlorate migrated into the
ground water from the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, which is two
miles from the proposed community. Rockets were tested for decades at
the lab.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual has said if the contamination is significant, it
will not tap that ground water to irrigate its golf course.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's five supervisors are set to have their say on the
study at the Dec. 10 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Griffin, spokesman for the Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch
group, urged the board to schedule a series of nighttime hearings
around the county before it votes.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from allowing more residents to comment on the project, such
hearings would most likely delay the supervisors' vote into next year
and achieve a political goal of Washington Mutual's opponents.</TE>
<TE>   In January, project supporter Frank Schillo will leave the board
and opponent Linda Parks will arrive. If the supervisors vote as
their planning appointees did Friday, the new majority would block
the Ahmanson project.</TE>

<HD>Fliers Will Need Boarding Passes to Pass Security</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Transportation Security Administration, the new federal agency
formed after the Sept. 11 attacks, plans to require all airline
passengers to have boarding passes before they pass through security,
a spokeswoman said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Since September, the agency has been using the new procedures at
parts of six airports around the country, including Jet Blue flights
from Long Beach Airport and American Airlines flights from Los
Angeles International, Heather Rosenker said.</LD>
<LD>   "It is working well," she said. "That's why it continues to be
expanding."</LD>
<TE>   Boarding passes contain special coded information that flags some
passengers for more thorough security checks. In the past, these
checks have taken place at the gate as passengers prepare to board
planes.</TE>
<TE>   But Rosenker said requiring passengers to have their boarding
passes as they pass through security will improve safety, because law
enforcement officials and sensitive technology are at the checkpoints
and not at the gates.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, she said, the new procedures would cut down on
waiting times because planes will no longer have to wait while
passengers are pulled aside for additional screening. To prevent
congestion at ticket counters, electronic kiosks that print boarding
passes and additional staff may be added.</TE>
<TE>   Random checks at the gates will continue, she said.</TE>

<HD>Man Gets Life Term in Kidnapping</HD>
<DH>The Texan held a former partner and locked him in a box to
recover personal flying device.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione and Errin Haines</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Texas businessman was sentenced to life in prison Friday for
kidnapping a former partner and holding him hostage in North
Hollywood for eight days, sometimes handcuffed and in a wooden box,
as part of a scheme to recover a stolen rocket-powered flying device.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Laurence Stanley, 57, slumped over in his chair and put his
head on the counsel table -- on the verge of tears -- as Los Angeles
County Superior Court Judge Barry A. Taylor ordered him to serve life
plus 10 years in state prison.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. [Brad] Barker was not harmed in any way," said Stanley, who
fired his lawyer after the trial and was representing himself in the
penalty phase. "I don't understand how this is a life sentence."</LD>
<TE>   He told the judge: "Your Honor, I never imagined that I ever did
anything wrong. I was just trying to be persuasive."</TE>
<TE>   He nearly broke down crying as he told the court that his 10-year
pursuit of the RocketBelt 2000 has cost him more than half a million
dollars and left his family "destitute and on food stamps."</TE>
<TE>   Moments earlier, his co-defendant, 55-year-old Christopher James
Wentzel, escaped a similar sentence when he entered into a plea
agreement with prosecutors. He was sentenced to seven years in state
prison.</TE>
<TE>   A Van Nuys jury in April found Stanley, of Sugar Land, Texas, and
Wentzel, of North Hollywood, guilty of kidnapping, false imprisonment
and extortion.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley and Bradley Wayne Barker, along with a third partner,
spent years developing the RocketBelt 2000, a Buck Rogers-like
backpack that was designed to lift a person into the air for several
seconds. After a few years, their relationship soured as the men
fought over money and possession of the device.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley sued Barker and in 1999 won the rights to the belt, which
he believed Barker was hiding. The RocketBelt was last seen publicly
at the Houston Rockets' 1995 NBA championship celebration.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, Stanley and Wentzel lured Barker, 47,
from Arkansas to Los Angeles in November 1999 with the promise of a
job on a Hollywood movie set.</TE>
<TE>   When Barker arrived, they held him against his will in an attempt
to learn where he had hidden the belt. Barker later escaped through a
window.</TE>
<TE>   Barker said Friday he is pleased with Stanley's sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess my son and I are safe for a while," Barker said. "He's a
dangerous person, and he is where he belongs."</TE>
<TE>   Barker said he was less concerned with Wentzel's fate.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know which is worse, seven years in prison or eight days
in a box," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter Korn agreed to the lesser sentence
because, he said, Wentzel had been Stanley's "lackey" who got
involved only for the $10,000 he believed he could collect for
returning Barker to Arkansas for trial on a burglary charge (which
was later dropped).</TE>
<TE>   The defense argued that Stanley and Wentzel were acting as bail
bondsmen and holding Barker so he would not skip out on an Arkansas
court date.</TE>
<TE>   Korn countered that Stanley was obsessed with recovering the belt
and "would definitely be out there pursuing the RocketBelt at any
cost," were he not in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Korn also said Stanley, who never took responsibility for his role
in the crimes, had predicted in court that he would win on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how he justified in his mind how it is legal to put
someone in a box," the prosecutor said.Korn said he offered both
defendants at least two chances to plea to lesser charges, but only
as a package deal. Stanley refused, making it impossible for Wentzel
to take advantage of a plea agreement during the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors were wary of making a deal with Wentzel too early,
fearing that he would admit to the crime and exonerate Stanley.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Korn said he was convinced that Wentzel was less culpable
and, because of his age and lack of a serious criminal record,
deserved less than a life sentence for his role.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor asked the court to dismiss the kidnapping charge
against Wentzel, who waived his right to appeal and was sentenced for
false imprisonment and extortion.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the worst thing that Mr. Wentzel did was put Mr. Barker
in the box," Korn said, calling the act "inhumane and despicable."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Donald J. Calabria told the judge that Wentzel's
case was not typical.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a different man than many of the people you've
sentenced," Calabria said.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was ever a man that would never be back here again under
any circumstances, this is the man."</TE>

<HD>Blue Line Train Kills Teenager in Crosswalk</HD>
<DH>The incident just south of downtown Los Angeles brings the
light rail's fatality total to 61.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 16-year-old girl was killed Friday when she was struck by a Blue
Line train on a street just south of downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The accident raises the death toll to 61 on the light railway
since it opened in 1990. The 22-mile line connecting downtown with
Long Beach has many stretches that run among cars and pedestrians on
busy streets. It has the worst fatal accident rate among light-rail
lines in California and is among the deadliest railways in the
nation, according to Federal Transit Administration statistics.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses told police the girl was in a crosswalk when she was hit
about 7:30 a.m. by a southbound train near a station platform in the
700 block of East Washington Boulevard, said LAPD Sgt. Kevin Custard.</LD>
<TE>   The witnesses said the girl, whose name was being withheld pending
notification of her family, was crossing the street against a
pedestrian red-light signal.</TE>
<TE>   "She apparently was rushing across the street, even though she
didn't have a signal to go," Custard said. "The train hit her and ran
her over."</TE>
<TE>   She was pronounced dead at the scene by Los Angeles Fire
Department officials.</TE>
<TE>   Full service on the Blue Line was stopped for about two hours, an
MTA spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Line carries about 62,000 riders daily, making it one of
the busiest light-rail lines in the nation.</TE>

<LD>A group of City Council members proposed Friday that the San Fernando
Valley be divided into four neighborhood service areas, each with its
own city hall and staff, instead of the two areas proposed by Mayor
James K. Hahn.</LD>
<LD>   Council members Tom LaBonge, Dennis Zine, Jack Weiss and Wendy
Greuel submitted the motion to the council, which was sent to a
committee for consideration with the mayor's plan.</LD>

<HD>Decision Fits Like a Golf Glove</HD>
<DH>L.A. Country Club and Holmby Hills residents reach a
compromise on course's safety fence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Golfers at the Los Angeles Country Club have finally met their match
in a yearlong fight with Holmby Hills residents teed off over a
proposed 120-foot-high driving range fence.</LD>
<LD>   Operators of the 300-acre course between Beverly Hills and
Westwood will only install 35-foot-high netting next to a driving
range. That's where duffers sometimes slice and hook balls into
neighboring Comstock Avenue -- and on at least one occasion knocked a
passerby unconscious.</LD>
<LD>   Nearby homeowners had complained that the planned safety fence
would block the view of the scenic golf course that they enjoy from
estates that average $5 million in price.</LD>
<TE>   "This fence is total overkill. It will dramatically impact us,"
said film and television actress Michele Lee, who has lived there 32
years.</TE>
<TE>   Country club leaders needed a zoning variance to build the tall
fence, and Los Angeles planners had been reviewing the construction
request since last year.</TE>
<TE>   The West Los Angeles Area Planning Commission finally played
through the red tape this week in hopes of settling the dispute. And
the country club double-bogeyed on the height request.</TE>
<TE>   Lee and her neighbors lobbed chip shots at the proposal during a
90-minute hearing, arguing that the club had not considered
structural changes to address the errant-ball issue. They suggested
that changing the location or the figuration of the driving range
would eliminate any safety problem.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the last neighborhoods on the Westside that feels
like it's in a rural area," Bud Frankfort told planners.</TE>
<TE>   "This fence would be a large, ugly, permanent eyesore," added Adri
Butler.</TE>
<TE>   A city hearing officer recommended that a 45-foot-high fence be
allowed as a compromise. That was acceptable to the club, but
commissioners worried that even that would be a detriment to the
neighborhood, as panel President Matthew Rodman put it.</TE>
<TE>   When homeowners' lawyers Robert Glushon and Kenneth Dusick
suggested the 35-foot height, the country club's attorney called for
what golfers refer to as a gimme.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like something better than nothing," shrugged Mark
Armbruster, noting that the club already had the right to erect a
30-foot-high fence without special city permission.</TE>
<TE>   With that, the planning foursome approved the 35-foot fence.
Holmby Hills residents were pleased by the 4-0 vote.</TE>
<TE>   This golf course dispute, they said, was resolved the fair way.</TE>

<HD>South-Central High School Makes a Strong Case</HD>
<DH>Manual Arts' Mock Trial competitors give elite suburban
team a run for its money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Manual Arts High School Toilers, who surprised naysayers by
making it to the elite field of 16 finalist schools in the annual Los
Angeles County Mock Trial Competition, learned this week that they
did not advance to the contest's fourth round -- falling short by a
single point.</LD>
<LD>   The trial team members, who had gone farther in the student
competition than any other entry from their South-Central Los Angeles
school, were very disappointed, said coach and English teacher Alan
Seigel.</LD>
<LD>   The scrappy Toilers, who had bartered in the Fashion district's
alley downtown to buy suits for the contest, faced teams from
neighborhoods populated by real lawyers and judges.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, Manual Arts faced the powerhouse squad from
William S. Hart High School in Newhall in the fictional case People
vs. Martin, in which cheating student Beck Martin stands accused of
killing a tattletale.</TE>
<TE>   Competing schools argue alternating sides of the case in rounds
until only two teams are left. The teams vie for a chance to
represent Los Angeles County in the state and national competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Jason Zepeda, who filled the role of the lead attorney on
Manual Arts' team, delivered a stirring closing statement built
around an extended metaphor.</TE>
<TE>   "Ladies and gentlemen," Zepeda said as he coolly paced the
courtroom. "The prosecution has painted a portrait of a murder. Let
that portrait hang where it belongs, adorning the wall of Beck
Martin's prison cell."</TE>
<TE>   The theatrics weren't enough to put Manual Arts over the top, even
with a perfect score for junior Emily Polanco's pretrial motion.</TE>
<TE>   But Polanco said there's always next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We've shown ourselves that we can do it, and there's nothing
stopping us," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the loss didn't come without complaint. Some students said
they were angry that senior Mayra Alcantar's sassy performance as
witness Cody Ward, which elicited laughter and compliments, received
a low score Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that something went wrong," Alcantar said. "Maybe they
didn't write it down right. The points they took away from me were
the points we needed to pass to the next level. They screwed me up
and my school, and that's not cool."</TE>
<TE>   But team members said they came away with a sense of achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "Inside of us, I really feel like we've won," Zepeda said.
"There's actually been something positive in the news about Manual
Arts, since all this violence has been plaguing this neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   That violence and the police attention to it, he said, is "making
me want to become a lawyer to really see to it that there's justice
in the courts."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Zepeda said, he's trying to think of something else for the
group to do.</TE>
<TE>   "Mock trial was something to keep us off the streets. Just for the
sake of hanging together, we were thinking of creating a new program,
maybe something having to do with drama."</TE>

<HD>Residents Assail Plans to Expand 101 Freeway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During a raucous community meeting in Griffith Park attended by about
400 people, audience members booed, jeered and berated transportation
officials as they tried to discuss proposals for expanding or
double-decking the Ventura and Hollywood freeways.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of the California Department of Transportation and
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority stressed at the meeting
Thursday night a need to accommodate future population growth along
the freeway corridor.</LD>
<LD>   Caltrans project manager Linda Taira said widening or adding an
elevated rail line to the 101 Freeway would only maintain traffic at
its current level.</LD>
<TE>   Doing nothing, Taira warned, would be disastrous. "We can't just
bury our heads in the sand," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd, which included residents from the Cahuenga Pass and
Hollywood Hills areas, reacted angrily.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't put the whole burden on the Ventura/Hollywood freeways,"
said Gerald A. Silver, president of the Coalition of Freeway
Residents. He said any freeway-widening project would be devastating
to surrounding neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   He called for a revival of a 1950s regional master plan for
building more freeways elsewhere in the San Fernando Valley, bringing
the cheering audience to its feet.</TE>
<TE>   Bigger freeways would only invite more motorists, other audience
members complained. They urged officials to work harder at improving
public transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "Rapid transit! Subway! Monorail!" they shouted.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation officials acknowledged their yearlong search for
traffic-reducing solutions -- which had focused primarily on
improvements to the freeway, nearby streets and bus service -- may
have been too narrow.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives from the two transportation agencies, which are
collaborating on a study covering 40 miles of the freeway corridor
from Thousand Oaks to downtown Los Angeles, are talking about the
possibility of future rail projects.</TE>
<TE>   An MTA official at the meeting said one idea being floated
involves a subway that would run under Ventura Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   His remark, however, was mostly ignored, dismissed by some
audience members as "just talk."</TE>
<TE>   In March, transportation officials presented a list of 12
proposals for improving traffic flow along the 101 corridor. That was
narrowed to five proposals in July, though none included a subway.</TE>

<HD>The Case of the Purloined Parakeet Causes a Flap in Quiet
Laguna Beach</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>And you thought Tweety had problems with Sylvester.</LD>
<LD>   In Laguna Beach, a resident told police that, after her parakeet
flew away, she received a call from a nearby resident who said, "I
have your bird. Give me $100 and you can have him back."</LD>
<LD>   The owner resisted. So the property manager at the victim's
complex attempted to resolve the matter by buying another parakeet
for the finder, the Laguna News-Post reported.</LD>
<TE>   But the substitute bird was refused because the finder liked how
well trained the original was. The victim then phoned police. And
Animal Control officers recovered the missing bird, the newspaper
said.</TE>
<TE>   I phoned Laguna police Friday but was unable to find anyone who
could tell me whether any laws had been broken. Or, more important,
what had happened to the substitute bird.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More fowl play: A woman phoned police, the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise said, to complain about a neighbor's bantam rooster
that "roams free" and visits her front yard when "the children walk
to school."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unreal estate: Today's showings (see accompanying) include:</TE>
<TE>   * A property that must be in a pretty windy area (Anne
Schoenberger of Long Beach).</TE>
<TE>   * A house that Donald Baldridge of La Canada-Flintridge calculates
has only one-fourth of a bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   * A garage that must have been built for horses (Nora Travis of La
Palma).</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally, in the category of eternal housing, Dennis Rhoads
of Arroyo Grande writes: "Every time we go to Sedona, Ariz., I can't
help but feel that the 'No Outlet' sign is redundant. Also, Pine
seems to be an appropriate name for a street where a cemetery is."
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seeing red: Several beauty salons in Riverside and San Bernardino
counties were sued for allegedly using the same bottle of nail polish
for multiple patrons, the L.A. Daily Journal reports.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiff, a self-proclaimed watchdog, said such a practice
violated state sanitation laws. But the Journal quoted a state
official who disputed that notion.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, I liked the very appropriate quote from a lawyer for the
defendants. He said: "We will battle tooth and nail in the courts."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sinking Lakers: I mentioned that it seems obvious that the Lakers
are not going to win a fourth straight NBA title and I asked readers
for a phrase to sum up this depressing fact.</TE>
<TE>   Daryl Studebaker suggested "four flushers" and Kelvin Filer
offered "four-get it" (though Filer said he secretly believes the
Lakers will somehow finish on top again). Rich Roberts said he
switched from one miserable Laker performance on TV "to the History
Channel, which had a special on the Titanic. There were several
similarities."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: You can have your cake, but.... The Seal Beach Sun
reported that an intruder "was found in the kitchen of a hotel eating
cake. The man was arrested after running from police."</TE>

<HD>As Mobile Park Rolls, Skaters Jump on Board</HD>
<DH>A skateboard course is set up at a different Long Beach
site each day of the week. It recently made the cover of a trade
publication.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Hernandez and Nancy Wride</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a Monday afternoon at Long Beach's Houghton Park, where the
tennis courts have just been transformed into a temporary skateboard
course. Some of the expectant kids showed up early, just to watch it
being built.</LD>
<LD>   Unloaded from a city truck, the custom jigsaw pieces are assembled
into the tubes, pipes, ramps and other hardware that make up the
course and provoke fretting by parents but thrill their offspring.</LD>
<LD>   Against the fence circling the course, a few first-timers watch
the action, too intimidated to give it a go, nervously clutching
their unscratched boards, pretending nonchalance.</LD>
<TE>   Austin Howard has an excuse to chicken out, but he doesn't. He is
under 4 feet tall and weighs 63 pounds. He's 6 years old, and going
for it, although it will be only his second time on a board.</TE>
<TE>   No small pressure that his mother is up against the fence
overlooking the course, her video camera trained on his attempts to
remain upright on his slow-moving board.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to learn to do really cool tricks," Austin says, his eyes
almost covered by his oversized helmet. "The first time I went, I was
kind of nervous because I was little. I busted my elbow. See?"</TE>
<TE>   Austin peels back his long-sleeved T-shirt and proudly displays a
thick scab.</TE>
<TE>   Last week says his mother, Arianna Pando, "He was the accident of
the evening.</TE>
<TE>   "He's kind of green, getting in people's way," she says. But that
won't last. On Thursday, she says, "He'll go 'Mom, seven days till
the skate park.' On Wednesday, 'Six days.' [Monday] morning, he's
like, 'How many hours?' "</TE>
<TE>   Pando focuses her camera on her other son, Alec, 10. "I have to
choose my battles," she says. "Yeah, I'm afraid they'll get hurt. But
they'll keep doing it and it's just harder for me if I don't get with
the program. They're boys!"</TE>
<TE>   Plus, she adds, her boys wear out after three hours of
skateboarding, and when they get home, "They conk out. I love it."</TE>
<TE>   Every day of the week, Long Beach's mobile skate park is set up at
a different location for skateboarders to practice their "ollies,"
"grinds" and "board slides."</TE>
<TE>   With 2,500 registered participants attesting to its popularity,
the park made the September cover of Skatepark Magazine, a national
trade publication for park operators.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't the largest course but they have so many kids.... It's
amazing," said Richard Hawthorne, owner of Vert Manufacturing in
Costa Mesa, which produced the reinforced custom equipment for Long
Beach and for other skate parks around the country.</TE>
<TE>   The value of the mobile, or temporary, skate park is that it
provides a relatively safe spot for skateboarders in the absence of a
permanent facility. Mobile parks are also much cheaper than permanent
ones. Long Beach already had a van for its mobile recreation program,
so staffing and supplies cost $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   The costs have discouraged municipalities from building parks for
the popular sport. For years, skateboarders were forced to hunt for
concrete where they could skate in darkened parking garages, empty
swimming pools or public places where the public often made it clear
they were not wanted.</TE>
<TE>   But liability concerns discouraged most communities from building
a place for the skateboarders to go. Officials said that after a
state law was passed in 1998 that limited government liability,
cities like Long Beach launched construction of permanent parks.</TE>
<TE>   So popular was Long Beach's stationary skate park at El Dorado
Park that council members in the eight other districts -- and their
constituents -- started clamoring for one near them.</TE>
<TE>   While a second park is being built, Long Beach's mobile course
meets a need. It also helps planners target future permanent
locations by assessing attendance at the temporary sites. The daily
average is 35.</TE>
<TE>   When the program was launched 18 months ago, there was no need to
trumpet a grand opening.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have to advertise. We didn't tell the schools," said
Cynthia Fogg youth services supervisor for the city's Parks and
Recreation Department. "Word of mouth spread the word that we're
here. The kids found us."</TE>
<TE>   On this Monday afternoon at Houghton Park, the city truck painted
in flashy designs pulls onto the tennis courts.</TE>
<TE>   In skateboarder jargon for stuff to glide and grind loud wheels
over, under, through and on top of, the contents unloaded include two
quarter pikes ("one is in the shop," workers said to a string of kids
who asked), a 6-foot flat rail, a 12-foot kinked rail, a 5-foot
adjustable rail, a 1-foot flat wedge and a "fun box."</TE>
<TE>   James Alvarez, 19, has come today to perfect his "back tail 180
out." That's a backward 360-degree turn in the air above the
skateboard, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Thin and nimble, with droopy eyes and a mop of sandy blond hair,
Alvarez starts off his practice runs with his usual warmup: trying an
impossible move and falling on purpose. That way says Alvarez, he
loses his fear of falling, and "I know how to fall when I do fall."</TE>
<TE>   It hurts?</TE>
<TE>   "Of course," he smiles. "It's the name of the game. That's part of
the adrenaline. It's the fear."</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez says that the fear and adrenaline hooked him when he was
15 -- that and the acrobatic art that requires balancing on a
3-foot-long board of solid wood with two sets of wheels attached
below it.</TE>
<TE>   While at Artesia High School in Lakewood, Alvarez saw a skating
video featuring an older friend who breaks his arm on screen. Cool,
Alvarez thought.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of influenced me to want to skate," he says. "I mean, I
like action sports."</TE>
<TE>   Now Alvarez skates every day, all day, at mobile skate parks.
Since he works nights as a loading hand for a parcel service, he can
wake up at 10:30 a.m. and hit the pavement on his skateboard for five
or six hours of skating before he has to leave for work.</TE>
<TE>   And when the Long Beach mobile skate park comes to Houghton Park,
he skates over from his apartment and practices among the dozen or so
kids who make use of the free equipment and free time.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't mind having to sign a waiver or obeying a rule that
requires him to wear a helmet., furnished by the city. "When I do
something cool and see little kids clap for me, it makes me feel
good, you know? It kind of makes me want to do better," he says.</TE>

<HD>Feds Charge Sleuth to the Stars</HD>
<DH>FBI search for evidence linking Anthony Pellicano to
alleged plot uncovers grenades and explosives in his office. His
attorney rejects all allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Glover and Matt Lait</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Celebrated private investigator Anthony Pellicano was charged Friday
with possession of two unregistered hand grenades discovered as
federal agents searched his office for evidence of his alleged
involvement in a plot to threaten a Los Angeles Times reporter who
was investigating actor Steven Seagal.</LD>
<LD>   During the search Thursday of Pellicano's West Hollywood office,
authorities also seized what appeared to be plastic explosives
"consistent with military C-4," according to a criminal complaint
filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Donald M. Re said Pellicano had a "legitimate reason" for
possessing the explosive, and denied that his client played any role
in threatening the Times reporter.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think there's any factual basis" to those allegations, Re
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pellicano, who appeared in court wearing handcuffs and day-old
clothing, was expected to remain in federal custody until at least
Wednesday, when a hearing to determine whether he should be released
before trial is scheduled to resume.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are seeking to have Pellicano held without bail,
arguing that he is a threat to the community. Re countered that
Pellicano is a solid citizen whose resume includes work for the
government.</TE>
<TE>   Pellicano is known as a sleuth to the stars; his clients have
included Michael Jackson, Elizabeth Taylor and many others.</TE>
<TE>   He offers clients a range of services and promises on his Web
site: "When retained, your problem becomes my problem."</TE>
<TE>   During the search on Thursday, the explosive materials were found
in a locked safe to which Pellicano allegedly told agents only he had
the combination.</TE>
<TE>   The grenades were designed as practice weapons, but had been
modified into "baseball-shaped pipe bombs that were designed to
fragment and to send shrapnel within the blast radius upon
detonation," according to an affidavit by FBI Agent Stanley E.
Ornellas.</TE>
<TE>   "They were nonlethal devices that had been altered for the
specific purpose of rendering them lethal."</TE>
<TE>   The explosive material in the safe, the affidavit states, "could
easily be used to blow up a car, and was in fact strong enough to
bring down an airplane."</TE>
<TE>   Also in the safe were 15 to 20 bundles of cash, "the majority of
which bore $10,000 wrappers."</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents obtained a warrant to search Pellicano's office on
Sunset Boulevard on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Though the warrant is sealed, Agent Ornellas stated in his
affidavit that the application submitted to the judge who issued it
"details evidence establishing probable cause to believe that
Pellicano hired and paid Alexander Proctor to burn the car of a Los
Angeles Times reporter who was writing a negative newspaper article
about one of Pellicano's celebrity clients."</TE>
<TE>   Proctor has been charged in connection with threatening reporter
Anita Busch by allegedly placing a dead fish, a rose and a one-word
note reading "Stop" on her car.</TE>
<TE>   In a secretly recorded conversation described in a request for
another warrant, Proctor allegedly told an FBI informant that he was
paid by Pellicano to carry out the threat on behalf of Seagal, who
wanted to dissuade Busch from her reporting on Seagal's relationship
with a reputed Mafia associate.</TE>
<TE>   Busch had been working on a story about Seagal's relationship with
friend and former producing partner Julius Nasso.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso was indicted earlier this year along with other reputed mob
figures in connection with a plot to extort money from Seagal.</TE>
<TE>   Seagal's attorney, Martin Pollner, denied that the actor had
anything to do with the threat on Busch.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to carrying out the threat against Busch, Proctor
allegedly told the FBI informant during one taped conversation that
Pellicano had "other jobs" for him.</TE>
<TE>   Proctor allegedly said Pellicano was waiting for his clients to
pay him the money up front before he would hire Proctor.</TE>
<TE>   One job, Proctor said, involved sneaking an Israeli national
suspected of murder out of the United States and back to Israel,
according to the affidavit. That job, Proctor said, was worth
$100,000.</TE>

<HD>Mediators Giving Port Talks a Push</HD>
<DH>Pension benefits appear to be last hurdle as contract
negotiations between West Coast dockworkers and shipping firms
intensify.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under pressure from mediators to reach a deal by the end of the
weekend, West Coast dockworkers and shipping companies were expected
to negotiate late into the night Friday to try to close the gap on
pension benefits -- the final unresolved issue in a hard-fought labor
contract.</LD>
<LD>   Top federal mediator Peter J. Hurtgen, who has been leading the
talks between the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the
Pacific Maritime Assn. in San Francisco, planned to return to
Washington, D.C., on Monday, said several sources.</LD>
<LD>   Also due back in Washington was AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer
Richard Trumka, who has been described as a moderating force in the
talks.</LD>
<TE>   Negotiations would probably resume after the Thanksgiving holiday.
Several people close to the talks said the venue could be moved to
the nation's capital.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service spokesman Jack Toner
confirmed that was a possibility, saying, "In years past, sometimes
people do get brought into Washington. It's not unheard of. It tends
to create more pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators met until 1 a.m. Friday, and resumed talks in the
afternoon. The intense negotiations come as the clock ticks on a
federal injunction that has kept ports open since early October,
following alleged union slowdowns and a 10-day management lockout.</TE>
<TE>   The disruptions stranded nearly 200 ships off the West Coast, put
port truckers out of work, panicked retailers and forced some
manufacturers to temporarily close plants for lack of imported parts.
More broadly, the dispute exposed the nation's dependence on imported
goods. Economists are still assessing the fallout, but estimates of
damage have been as high as $1 billion a day. Terminal yards were
clogged for more than a month after the shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   The impasse prompted President Bush to invoke the rarely used
Taft-Hartley Act to obtain an injunction establishing an 80-day
"cooling off" period. It is hoped that the union and shipping
companies can agree on a contract during that time.</TE>
<TE>   But despite moments of promise and a breakthrough deal on the
introduction of labor-saving technology, the talks have snagged on
pensions. The shipping companies in early October offered a plan with
maximum benefits of about $50,000 a year to retirees. The union has
insisted on a far higher rate, saying the industry will save tens of
millions of dollars each year through improved technology.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have honored a media blackout imposed by Hurtgen in
mid-October, so details on current offers are not available.</TE>
<TE>   If no deal is reached by Dec. 7, a Taft-Hartley timetable requires
management's final offer to go directly to a vote of union rank and
file. Once that process begins, labor experts said, serious
negotiations are unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the National Labor Relations Board, which would
oversee the vote, said they are already making contingency plans. The
union's 10,500 dockworkers would be eligible to cast ballots,
probably at union hiring halls along the coast.</TE>
<TE>   The election would be held sometime between Dec. 7 and 21, said
Hugo Voogd, a deputy in the NLRB legal office. Certified results
would then go to the U.S. attorney general by Dec. 26, when the
80-day cooling-off period is due to end.</TE>
<TE>   Michael LeRoy, a professor of labor and industrial relations at
the University of Illinois, said union members have never approved a
contract under the Taft-Hartley election process. The last time the
process was used was in 1971, and that too involved the longshore
union. That offer by shipping companies was defeated by an
overwhelming margin, Voogd said.</TE>
<TE>   Once the injunction ends, there will be no legal restraints to
prevent either side from again shutting down the docks, LeRoy said.
Congress could intervene, however, and even impose a contract, under
a provision of Taft-Hartley that has never been used, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the ultimate lever is the Republican Congress coming into
power," he said. Democrats, already on the defensive, are unlikely to
take a hard stand on longshore workers, many of whom earn more than
$100,000 a year, he said. And there may not be widespread public
support for the union when the deal being offered puts pensions far
higher than the average U.S. income.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this will have the same sort of thud on working people as
the baseball players' anticipated strike," LeRoy said. "There comes a
point where people don't sing 'Solidarity Forever.' "</TE>

<HD>Crackdown on Unscrupulous Lenders OKd</HD>

<LD>The Los Angeles City Council gave preliminary approval Friday to an
ordinance that significantly alters the way some home loans are made
in the city, cheering advocates who say the law will help prevent
unwitting homeowners from losing their homes and equity to
unscrupulous lenders.</LD>
<LD>   "The ordinance gives those who are nervous about the sharks
roaming around our neighborhoods a sense of relief and protection,"
said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas.</LD>
<LD>   Capping an 18-month effort, the unanimous vote hands a major
victory to Ridley-Thomas, who proposed the ordinance, and the Assn.
of Community Organizations for Reform Now, which lobbied hard on its
behalf.</LD>
<TE>   The ordinance addresses "predatory lending" -- high-interest,
high-fee loans to homeowners who lack the ability to make the
payments. The victims -- often older people, poor people and people
of color -- sometimes lose their equity and their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Such loans are offered by "sub-prime lenders," those that
primarily deal with borrowers who lack the "A" rating needed to
borrow from prime lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Housing advocates say lenders often target those who lack the
financial savvy to understand the deals. People who don't speak
English also are likely to fall victim.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, cities and states, including California, have
passed laws to address the problem.</TE>
<TE>   But the California law, which went into effect in July, falls
short of what is needed to address the conditions in Los Angeles,
advocates said.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing Thursday, banking industry representatives argued
that more time was needed to assess the effects of the state law.
Others argued that the ordinance would chase lenders out of the city,
hurting the very people it intends to help.</TE>
<TE>   "This proposed ordinance is premature and too risky," Melissa
Richards, general counsel for the California Mortgage Bankers Assn.,
said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But virtually every member of the City Council spoke of
constituents struggling with unscrupulous lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Ed Reyes said the new law should not concern good
lenders "because they aren't doing anything wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Added Councilman Dennis Zine: "If the industry had policed itself,
we probably wouldn't be here."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of predatory lending has been a key concern for
Ridley-Thomas, dating to his days as the head of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento-bound Ridley-Thomas has been packing his bags for
the state Assembly with one hand and with the other pressing for an
ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of public policy serves the interest of people who most
need it," he said. "Our silence only makes us complicit."</TE>
<TE>   All 11 council members present voted to pass the ordinance. . It
must go before the council again for a second reading but will need
only eight votes to be approved.</TE>
<TE>   The unanimous vote Friday drew loud applause from a council
chambers packed with members of the Assn. of Community Organizations
for Reform Now and local unions.</TE>
<TE>   Helen Coleman, who said she had lost her five-bedroom Los Angeles
home because of a predatory lender, called the vote an early
Thanksgiving gift to the city's homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   The retired city worker became an activist after her ordeal,
dedicating her time to passing the ordinance to prevent others from
living her experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so happy," said Coleman, on the verge of tears.</TE>

<TE>   Differences in L.A., State Laws</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles City Council's preliminary approval of an
ordinance that addresses "predatory lending" -- high-interest,
high-fee loans to homeowners who lack the ability to make the
payments -- caps an 18-month effort. Key differences between the
state and local law:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   State Law</TE>
<TE>   * Coverage amounts: Covers all loans of $250,000 or less.</TE>
<TE>   * Sub-prime loans: Defines "sub-prime loans" -- the kind covered
by the law -- as any with an annual percentage rate more than eight
percentage points above U.S. Treasury notes.</TE>
<TE>   * Credit counseling: Requires lenders making covered sub-prime
loans to provide the borrower a written "Consumer Caution and
Homeownership Counseling Notice," which suggests that the borrower
consider consulting a qualified independent credit counselor
regarding rates, fees and provisions of the loan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Ordinance</TE>
<TE>   * Coverage amounts: Applies only to refinance loans. Covers loans
of more than $250,000, but the top limit would vary with market
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   * Sub-prime loans: Defines "sub-prime loans" as those with an
annual percentage rate that is more than six percentage points above
U.S. Treasury notes, or loans with points and fees that exceed four
percentage points of the total loan amount. As a result, the Los
Angeles ordinance would apply to more loans than the state measure.</TE>
<TE>   * Credit counseling: Prohibits lenders from making high-cost loans
unless they receive written certification that the borrower has
received face-to-face credit counseling in the borrower's primary
language. Borrowers can waive counseling, but must do so in writing.</TE>
<TE>   * Foreclosure protection: Allows the borrower to assert violation
of the ordinance as a defense against foreclosure. There is no
comparable provision in the state law.</TE>

<HD>Police Ask for Help to Find Slaying Suspect</HD>
<DH>The LAPD is trying to locate teenager after latest
shooting. Meanwhile the city's homicide figures are revised upward.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Tamaki and Patrick Mcgreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police sought help from the public Friday in locating a
17-year-old suspected of fatally shooting a Crenshaw High School
basketball player -- one of 18 people killed within the last week,
mostly in South Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles police officials also announced Friday that the city
has had 606 homicides so far this year -- 10 more than The Times
previously reported on the basis of information from police
officials.</LD>
<LD>   Police Sgt. John Pasquariello said crime statistics are often
revised throughout the year.</LD>
<TE>   "Some things are reclassified as homicides that were not
originally, sometimes people who were injured die," Pasquariello
said.</TE>
<TE>   The new total moves the city over the threshold of 600 for the
first time since 1996, when 707 homicides were reported. Los Angeles
had a peak of 1,092 homicides in 1992, the year of the riots, but
then saw the number fall more than half by 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, however, as homicide rates have plunged in
many other big cities, killings in Los Angeles have increased. They
have jumped by more than 40% since a low of 428 four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent homicide in South Los Angeles, police are
searching for Antwaine Butler in connection with the killing Thursday
of Clyve Jackson, 14, of South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe Butler approached Jackson outside a doughnut shop
in the 4400 block of South Western Avenue, according to Det. Kevin
Jolivette.</TE>
<TE>   The two, who had had a previous encounter, were fighting when
Butler allegedly drew a gun and shot Jackson, Police Capt. Jim Miller
said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said police identified Butler after tips from the public.
He said detectives talked to Butler on Friday morning after his
family paged him for police.</TE>
<TE>   Butler, whom police described as armed and dangerous, refused to
surrender.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Los Angeles school officials sent crisis counselors to
Crenshaw High School to help more than 100 of Jackson's peers deal
with their grief.</TE>
<TE>   "He was on our basketball team and was well-received by his
peers," said Michael White, the school's dean of students. "He was a
mild-mannered young man. He was not a discipline problem."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's classmates, who are planning a memorial Wednesday for
their friend, also used kind words to describe the ninth-grader. "A
lot of people knew him," said Leyla Rodriguez, 14. "So everybody was
crying today."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview while on a 10-day trip to Asia, Mayor James K.
Hahn said he is deeply disturbed by the violence in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a tragedy that this many people are losing their lives to
violence and it has to stop," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't remember something like this in a very long time," Hahn
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the middle of summer. It's here in the middle of
November. It's a very perplexing wave of violence. You have to figure
out why it's happening and how it can stop."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he had urged Chief William J. Bratton to try to
involve other agencies in his effort to curb the violence. He said he
suggested that the chief ask the U.S. attorney's office for
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to halt a wave of homicides were also being made Friday at
City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Nate Holden, who represents the 10th City Council
District, which includes parts of South Los Angeles, called for the
Police Commission to revisit the compressed work schedule and senior
lead officer programs to determine whether they are keeping Bratton
from putting the largest possible police force on the street.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had one of the bloodiest weeks in the history of Los
Angeles," Holden said before introducing a motion calling for the
study.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to fight crime, we must take the handcuffs off of Chief
Bratton and give him the flexibility to deploy police personnel where
needed."</TE>
<TE>   Holden's criticism of the compressed work schedule was denounced
as unfounded by the Police Protective League, the officers union that
worked hard to establish the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "It is evident by his illogical analysis of the recent spate of
tragic murders that he is once again using his disdain for flexible
work schedules as a platform to get attention," the league said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   The union said flexible work schedules promote safety by
increasing officers' morale, helping with recruitment of new officers
and saving the city money on overtime.</TE>
<TE>   In another development, detectives identified the victim of a
shooting Thursday in a West Los Angeles neighborhood as Kareem
Salguero, 23.</TE>
<TE>   A witness saw a man chasing two other men about 4:35 p.m. near
Sawyer Street and Preuss Road, Police Det. Ron Phillips said.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman, who was overheard shouting gang terms, chased Salguero
into the backyard of a home in the 1900 block of Preuss, where he was
shot.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives are investigating whether the death was related to a
graffiti incident because they say Salguero was found with a can of
spray paint.</TE>
<TE>   In an unrelated case, Miller said police had charged three men in
the fatal shooting Tuesday of a man at 83rd Street and Western
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The three men were attacked moments after the shooting at 76th and
Western, Miller said.</TE>

<HD>Leaking Big Rig Closes Freeway</HD>
<DH>Traffic is diverted for hours after hydrogen peroxide
spills onto the 710 in South Gate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A big rig leaking industrial-strength hydrogen peroxide shut down the
Long Beach Freeway on Friday, backing up traffic in both directions
for miles and sending a California Highway Patrol officer to the
hospital for treatment, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The 40-foot Pacifica Chemicals Inc. truck was flagged down near
Firestone Boulevard in South Gate at 11:30 a.m. by northbound
motorists who noticed white smoke rising from its liquid-cargo tank,
said Inspector Edward Osorio of the Los Angeles County Fire
Department.</LD>
<LD>   "The CHP officer who initially rolled up to the scene complained
of feeling nauseous," Osorio said.</LD>
<TE>   "He was taken to a nearby hospital and is in stable condition."</TE>
<TE>   The cleanup was slowed because hazardous materials teams were
unable to identify the liquid -- used as a bleaching agent -- for
about an hour, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing a potential disaster, authorities diverted northbound
traffic to the Century Freeway and southbound traffic to the Pomona
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Southbound lanes were reopened at 1:30 p.m. Three northbound lanes
were reopened about 3:20 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The cleanup operation triggered massive disruptions on surrounding
streets.</TE>

<HD>Police Arrest 84 in 2nd Skid Row Sweep as Advocates Voice
Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police arrested another 84 wanted criminals and suspects in a second
massive sweep of downtown's skid row Thursday night and Friday
morning that officials said was needed to counter a recent spate of
street crime.</LD>
<LD>   About 65% of those taken into custody were fugitives violating
parole by associating with felons or using controlled substances, a
state official said.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not rounding up the homeless," said Russ Heimerich, a
spokesman for the state Department of Corrections. "These are people
who knowingly absconded" from the law.</LD>
<TE>   But advocates for the estimated 5,000 homeless on the streets
downtown again questioned the wisdom of the sweeps involving hundreds
of federal, state and local law enforcement officers.</TE>
<TE>   "Half the homeless on skid row have a drug problem and have an
alcohol problem," said Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the
Coalition to End Hunger and Homelessness. "So it's really easy to
find lots of people on parole."</TE>
<TE>   The latest action brought to almost 200 the number of people
arrested in the sweeps, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not always going to catch them in the act [of a crime] or
have witnesses," said LAPD Capt. Charlie Beck, commander of the
central area. "So this is a tool to remove predators from the
street."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said skid row has the highest concentration of parolees
in California. Through Nov. 16, there were 1,100 robberies, up 20%
over last year in the four-square-mile central area that includes
skid row. There were 825 assaults, up 14% over the same period, Beck
said.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by phalanxes of patrol cars, officers fanned out across the
areas bounded 1st, Spring and 7th streets and the Los Angeles River
overnight Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Officers again focused on low-cost hotels around 5th Street, an
area known as "the Nickel," knocking on doors and checking on
parolees.</TE>
<TE>   Those found violating the conditions of their parole -- such as
possessing drugs or guns, associating with gang members or simply
failing to check in with their parole officers -- were taken into
custody.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that many of the parolees had a history of drug use or
dealing, and that others had previous convictions for serious
offenses such as sex crimes, robberies, assaults and drug sales. One
had been convicted of manslaughter, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Those arrested ranged in age from 27 to 66.</TE>
<TE>   Others arrested during an initial sweep Wednesday, according to
LAPD records, were still being held on such misdemeanors as
obstructing a police officer and failure to appear in court. Some of
those arrested Wednesday and held on bail as low as $250 remained in
jail Friday. Their offenses included loitering on city sidewalks and
failure to appear in court.</TE>
<TE>   In the second sweep, police handed out just 10 citations for
jaywalking and moving violations after dispensing 100 during the
earlier sweep. Those cited were not taken into custody, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The raids followed by just 48 hours complaints by business
organizations about the number of homeless people on skid row.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Warren, vice president for public policy at the Central
Cities Assn., which represents 300 mostly downtown-area businesses,
said her group has called for dealing with the problem of lawlessness
in the skid row area.</TE>
<TE>   But she called the timing of the raid coincidental.</TE>
<TE>   "We had nothing to do with that sweep," Warren said.</TE>
<TE>   Heimerich, the state official, called the action "an extremely
successful operation. It looks like we've struck a vein."</TE>

<HD>Officials' Arrests Send Aftershock Through Carson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reaction to the arrests of several current and former Carson city
officials on bribery charges this week ranged from disappointment to
relief, much of it laced with a strong dose of I-told-you-so's.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests also prompted longtime civic activists, along with one
of the two council members not involved in the corruption case, to
step up their calls for campaign-finance reforms and a new municipal
ethics program. They said corruption is inevitable when business
interests fund winning candidates' elections, as is often the case in
this South Bay city of nearly 90,000.</LD>
<LD>   City Hall, which operates on a four-day, 10-hour schedule, was
closed Friday, but that did not slow the buzz that erupted Thursday,
when Mayor Daryl Sweeney, Councilwoman Raunda Frank and several
others were charged with extorting money from businesses or related
crimes. Officials were also trying to grapple with the logistics of
conducting the public's business under a cloud that already has left
one council seat empty and forced cancellation of several council
meetings for lack of a quorum.</LD>
<TE>   The arrests capped a corruption probe that surfaced last spring,
when Councilman Manny Ontal abruptly resigned amid accusations from a
commercial trash-hauler that the mayor and others had solicited what
appeared to be a bribe. Ontal, who also was arrested Thursday, had
earlier confessed his own part in the apparent corruption and offered
to help expose the others, according to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "My first reaction, although saddened that this investigation
would be needed, is that of relief," said Rita Boggs, a city planning
commissioner and longtime civic activist who has carefully followed
news reports of the unfolding federal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "I am grateful that Manny Ontal had the courage to speak up,"
Boggs said. But she expressed concern about how the commission, which
helps make decisions on private development proposals, could continue
to function.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the commission's nine members are Sweeney appointees,
Boggs said. They presumably would be replaced if Sweeney, who has
pleaded not guilty, is eventually convicted and removed from office.</TE>
<TE>   Others expressed disappointment in the mayor, who was portrayed in
a grand jury indictment as the ringleader in the alleged bribery and
extortion scheme.</TE>
<TE>   "He had so much to offer society and the community when he was
first elected," said Parks and Recreation Commissioner Harry E.
"Buddy" Barron. "If this is true, it really hurts. If true, it means
he robbed me and the other citizens of Carson, and that is really a
shame."</TE>
<TE>   For former Mayor Gil Smith, a member of the first City Council
after Carson's incorporation in 1968, Thursday's developments were
especially disheartening, because they marked the third major
corruption scandal in the city he and others worked so hard to found.</TE>
<TE>   This one "undoubtedly will impact on the morale and image and
prestige of the city, and it will undoubtedly have an impact on the
city's ability to conduct business," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I just have to hold onto the hope that it will strengthen the
resolve of future candidates" to run an honest government, he said.
"It has taken a while, but the city has always overcome" past
scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Former Councilwoman Vera Robles DeWitt, who led an unsuccessful
ballot initiative to halt the city's practice of limiting commercial
trash pickup to a single hauler, said she felt vindicated by
Thursday's arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sad day for the city," DeWitt said Friday, "but,
basically, I have spent the last two years and a lot of money ... to
bring about lawful contracting practices. In a way, it's kind of
great to be vindicated.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the city will heal, and we will go forward, but it's time
we get some new leadership," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Former Mayor Mike Mitoma, a member of the Alliance for Honest
Government, said he too feels vindicated. The alliance is a group of
25 to 30 residents who lobby for more-open government practices.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been out there yelling and screaming that there is
corruption in City Hall, and we just get ignored and called
gadflies," Mitoma said. "Now this comes to light. We are not
surprised. We think there are at least half a dozen other contracts
that are questionable, and now maybe the public will wake up and
listen to us."</TE>
<TE>   Dianne Thomas, a leader of the reform-minded Carson Neighborhood
Council, said she hopes the "blight on the city" from the corruption
charges will provide impetus for the reforms her group has long been
seeking.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope some good will come out of this," Thomas said, adding that
her group was already planning an open-government workshop in January
with the California First Amendment Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "We need some sunshine laws and ways to police [government] so
things can be caught before they get too far out of hand," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jim Dear said he too hopes campaign finance reform and
other open-government measures will grow out of the corruption
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very resilient community with a lot of wonderful people
who want to make a difference," Dear said. "We have had corruption in
the past, but we have always come out of it, and always come back
strong."</TE>
<TE>   Of more immediate concern, he added, is how the city will operate
in the short term. Already hobbled by the vacancy left when Montal
resigned, the council probably will have another vacancy soon if
Frank carries out her stated intentions to plead guilty. (Anyone
found guilty of a felony cannot hold elected office in California.)</TE>
<TE>   Dear said City Atty. Peter Thorson has told him that the council
could continue to conduct routine city business with as few as two
people left on the five-member council. But major policy decisions
would have to be put on hold until new members were appointed or
elected.</TE>
<TE>   A makeup council meeting scheduled for Tuesday has been canceled,
Dear said. The next regularly scheduled meeting is Dec. 3.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Sweeney, Frank and Montal, federal authorities
charged former Mayor Pete Fajardo, former Inglewood Councilman
Garland Hardeman, former Browning Ferris Industries executive Douglas
Allyn Moore and Sweeney's personal attorney, Robert D. Pryce Jr., in
connection with the corruption probe.</TE>
<TE>   Two other waste hauler representatives, Michael Aloyan and David
Duan Robinson, also were charged.</TE>

<CX>   Carson investigation -- A story in Saturday's California section
erroneously stated that former Carson Councilman Manny Ontal had been
arrested in connection with a federal corruption probe. Ontal
approached federal authorities about corruption in Carson and agreed
to work undercover while they investigated. He agreed to plead guilty
to one count of accepting a $5,000 payoff from a city contractor and
of failing to report $33,000 in consultant's income on his tax
return.</CX>

<HD>Agile Minds in Idle Cars</HD>
<DH>Motorists give federal officials ideas ranging from
sensible to extreme on how to help reduce traffic congestion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California has some of the worst roadway troubles in the
nation, but traffic is not a problem exclusive to the sunny
Southland.</LD>
<LD>   Freeway congestion increased in every major city in the nation
last year. Nearly half of all urban freeways in the country are now
in an L.A.-like state of infuriating congestion during rush hours.
The average time motorists spend idling in traffic in major American
cities has nearly quadrupled over the last 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   What is a car-loving nation to do?</LD>
<TE>   Raise gasoline prices to $5 a gallon?</TE>
<TE>   Build "bicycle highways" that can carry thousands of speeding
cyclists at a time?</TE>
<TE>   If the paved roads are congested, let police and firefighters
drive around traffic in amphibious, high-speed vehicles?</TE>
<TE>   Call these suggestions what you like -- extreme, outlandish, wacky
-- but they represent some of the heartfelt sentiments of the
American people, regular folks who are fed up with traffic and ready
to try something new to get the country moving again.</TE>
<TE>   These are a handful of the more than 1,000 ideas submitted since
U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta asked Americans this
summer to comment on the nation's next multibillion-dollar
transportation funding program. To accept the public's ideas, the
Department of Transportation opened an Internet site. Old-fashioned
letters also are accepted.</TE>
<TE>   The suggestions range from the sensible (a balanced mix of mass
transit, bicycle and automobile facilities) to the extreme (tolls for
all single-occupant vehicles during rush hour) and the dire (limit
the number of cars that can be driven in the U.S.).</TE>
<TE>   Many suggestions are, in essence, just rants against the nation's
current traffic woes.</TE>
<TE>   "Cars are evil," wrote Scott Wilhelm of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "What a waste carpool lanes are," offered George Eusterman of
Mount Vernon, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Michael DeBlasi of Missoula, Mont., wrote: "If we could haul every
senator, representative and transportation official into jail for the
effects of this stupid system we have set up, I would volunteer to be
the one holding the door."</TE>
<TE>   Others, apparently unclear on the concept, raged about problems
completely off the topic.</TE>
<TE>   A New Hampshire man wrote to demand that America immediately
convert to the metric system. A New Mexico resident complained that
UPS still owes him money on a claim from the early 1990s. A woman
from Chico fumed about the foul odor emitted by a soiled toilet in a
Greyhound bus she took recently from San Diego to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how wild, angry or sensible the ideas might be,
federal transportation officials promise to read and consider every
one before the nation's next transportation funding program is
completed. The previous funding package, known as the Transportation
Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), allocated $217 billion
beginning in 1998. It expired in September.</TE>
<TE>   "All the suggestions go into the process of shaping our thinking,"
said Emil Frankel, the Transportation Department's assistant
secretary for transportation policy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he doesn't think the new funding bill will deviate
dramatically from the previous one. "We are not expecting this bill
to be revolutionary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe some of the extreme-sounding ideas are not completely
out of the question.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years ago, the idea of an electric car was a pipe dream,
said David Schrank, a researcher at the Texas Transportation
Institute. Today, electric cars are a reality on America's freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "These 'Star Trek' kind of ideas -- who knows what will happen in
20 years?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, federal transportation officials accepted the
public's suggestions during town hall meetings held throughout the
country and attended mostly by local transportation officials and
environmental activists.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the Transportation Department invited comments for the
first time on its Web site: www.fhwa.dot.gov/reauthorization.
Comments will be accepted until Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   But will the federal government really read and incorporate the
more than 1,000 suggestions into the nation's transportation
blueprint?</TE>
<TE>   Some people who have offered ideas are not optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on our experience, our voices do get somewhat ignored,"
said Marnie Criley, a policy coordinator for the Wildlands Center for
Preventing Roads, a Montana-based group that has urged the federal
government to stop building roads through forests and woods.</TE>
<TE>   A sampling of hundreds of submitted ideas indicates that many
Americans are fed up with mind-numbing traffic and want the federal
government to spend more on bicycle lanes, trains and sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, slow the building of roads to save God's earth for our
children," wrote Peter Perrari of Decatur, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Giroux of Dearborn, Mich., wrote: "We need to expand the
number of bicycling pathways. We need more, more, more."</TE>
<TE>   If Mineta's staff does read every suggestion, a few will probably
be filed away under the "extreme" category.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the idea submitted by Iguana Technology Inc. of
Washington state. The folks there suggested that when roads are
locked up, emergency personnel drive around the blockades in
specially made amphibian, all-terrain, tank-like vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Steele of Denver offered an idea that would probably get a
cold reception in Southern California: "Congested highways should
have tolls for single drivers during rush hour. In other words,
carpool or pay."</TE>
<TE>   Where speeding is a problem, Gregory Wright of Sherman Oaks
suggested that speed-limit signs be made larger. If that doesn't
work, he suggests adding exclamation points on the signs.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Donovan of San Francisco offered an idea that perhaps most
people could get behind: Outlaw junk mail and reduce the car trips
made by postal carriers.</TE>
<TE>   "Do all these things, big and small, seem too difficult?" she
wrote. "I say not so for the U.S. government, the one that freed
Nazi-occupied Europe, organized our species' first visit to the moon
and developed the most advanced system of weapons our planet has
known."</TE>

<LD>If only it were as simple as a Beatles song.</LD>
<LD>   "All you need is Shaq, da-da-da-da-da," a group of net-wearing
Laker fans sang.</LD>
<LD>   "All you need is Shaq, da-da-da-da-da. All you need is Shaq, Shaq
... Shaq is all you need."</LD>
<TE>   Finally, 12 games and 24 days after the NBA season started, the
Lakers had Shaquille O'Neal. Peace, harmony and maybe even a few
victories were sure to follow, right? Even if he didn't start, even
if his playing time was restricted, the mere sight of O'Neal in that
gold No. 34 jersey would restore the championship swagger to the
Lakers and strike fear in those nobody Chicago Bulls. Since Hubie
Brown's no longer available, isn't that how Paul McCartney would
break it down?</TE>
<TE>   "You could just see more confidence in some of the guys, knowing
that they were going to have the big fella back in the middle," Laker
guard Brian Shaw said. "It wasn't a pretty game to watch, but you
still felt like we were going to win ... for the first time in a long
time."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, O'Neal has to work his way back into playing condition and
his teammates -- especially the new ones -- have to learn his
"proclivities out there on the floor," as Phil Jackson put it.</TE>
<TE>   The question is, how good will they be once all of that happens?
On Friday, on a night when O'Neal was effective but not yet dominant
and Kobe Bryant settled into a third-quarter comfort zone, they
weren't good enough to put away a bad Bull team until late in the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   For a team whose only "W" in the previous eight games was an
overtime victory against the Golden State Warriors, that 86-73 win
might feel like an excuse to pop some Cristal. But for a group that's
responsible for hanging the three most recent gold banners in Staples
Center, it wasn't very impressive.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls were sorry even by their own 4-9 standards. Top scorer
Jalen Rose shot two for 16 and finished 17 points below his 23-point
average. The team shot 35 percent.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal checked in to a standing ovation with 5:43 remaining in the
first quarter. He had 17 points on eight-for-13 shooting and grabbed
seven rebounds in 21 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We got exactly what we hoped to get out of him tonight," Jackson
said. "Some points, some minutes and a win."</TE>
<TE>   Still, this wasn't the old rim-wrecking, posterizing Shaq. It
looked a lot more like the 2001-02 version, the guy whose game was
closer to rim level than above it. His speed and footwork looked OK.
But otherwise he resembled the prairie states: no elevation.</TE>
<TE>   You could notice the difference on the banner end of the court. It
was on that same basket that O'Neal made his most memorable play at
Staples Center, the slam off a Kobe Bryant lob that sealed the
Lakers' Game 7 comeback against the Portland Trail Blazers in 2000.
His hand was up near the top of the white box on that play. When Rick
Fox threw an alley-oop to O'Neal in the fourth quarter Friday, he
only barely reached above the rim to dunk it.</TE>
<TE>   He used to soar above even the biggest obstacles on the court. One
of my favorite pictures used to hang in the hallway of the Washington
Post. It was O'Neal, in his Orlando Magic uniform, dunking over
7-foot-7 Gheorghe Muresan. He cleared Muresan's outstretched hands by
at least 15 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, the 6-9 Donyell Marshall blocked two of O'Neal's
shots. One was a straight-up block of Shaq's baseline jumper,
something I've never seen before.</TE>
<TE>   So he'll have to rely more on power and pivot moves, while facing
an increased amount of double-teams and zones. His teammates didn't
do anything to establish themselves as threats while O'Neal was gone,
so opponents will be happy to sit back and say "fire away, fellas"
while they surround Shaq like the bartender at a hot nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   The players did get their promised open looks, and they usually
couldn't capitalize. Much of their scoring was hard-earned -- from an
aggressive Derek Fisher (16 points), then an opportunistic Bryant (16
of his 21 points in the third) and an over-exuberant Slava Medvedenko
(12 points on 17 shots -- in 17 minutes).</TE>
<TE>   All things considered, this will be O'Neal's most challenging
season since Hakeem Olajuwon's skills started to fade.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal wouldn't agree, but all of a sudden there are some
legitimate centers popping up in the Western Conference. Shawn
Bradley has gone from stick figure to low-post presence. Yao Ming is
looking more like a No. 1 pick every game.</TE>
<TE>   The most important part of O'Neal's night wasn't his time on the
court but how his achy foot felt afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels pretty good," he said. "The true test will be in the
morning."</TE>
<TE>   And in the weeks ahead.</TE>

<LD>   UCLA (0-0) at Hawaii (0-0), 11 a.m. PST, KBET (850)  -- UCLA
finally opens its regular season in a three-team, round-robin
tournament in Honolulu. The Bruins have never lost to the Rainbow
Wahine (4-0), but UCLA and Hawaii haven't met since 1984. The Rainbow
Wahine have three starters from last year's 23-8 team that played in
the WNIT.</LD>
<LD>   New Mexico (0-0) at USC (2-1), Sports Arena, noon  -- USC was
knocked out of the preseason WNIT Tuesday by fourth-ranked Kansas
State. But now the Trojans don't have the logistical nightmare of
traveling to Penn State after the game for Sunday's final. This is
the first meeting with New Mexico, which has four starters from last
season's 22-9 team.</LD>

<LD>It's the Sunday before the start of the NCAA basketball tournament
and the pairings are set. But UCLA announces it won't participate
unless it is put in the West Regional. Duke announces it won't play
in the same bracket as North Carolina. And North Carolina announces
it doesn't even recognize the NCAA's authority.</LD>
<LD>   Now that would be March madness.</LD>
<LD>   And that seems to be the type of madness surrounding a tournament
of a very different sort, the Oscar De La Hoya 154-pound event.</LD>
<TE>   Fernando Vargas wants no part of it. De La Hoya's promoter, Bob
Arum, wants no part of Winky Wright. Shane Mosley loves the
tournament as long as he gets to fight De La Hoya first. Vernon
Forrest, happy anybody wants him, loves the idea so much he is
negotiating to make De La Hoya his promoter.</TE>
<TE>   Reestablishing himself as the king of the nonheavyweights with his
victory in September over Vargas, on top of two losses by Mosley and
the retirement of Felix Trinidad, De La Hoya is trying to use his
power to provide for his immediate and long-term future. He wants to
finish his career with a few lucrative fights while building up his
promotional organization, Golden Boy Promotions, as a source of
income and influence in his post-fight years.</TE>
<TE>   Toward that end, De La Hoya has proposed a three-fight, 12- to
18-month event that would ideally pit him against Mosley and Vargas
against Forrest in first-round matches with a championship fight
between the winners.</TE>
<TE>   But it doesn't appear the event will become reality because boxing
just isn't that simple. You tell North Carolina it's going to play
Duke and that's the end of it. In boxing, it never seems to end.
There are promoters and television networks and sanctioning
organizations and they all have contracts to enforce and territories
to protect.</TE>
<TE>   In this case:</TE>
<TE>   * Vargas' promoter, Kathy Duva of Main Events, balks at De La
Hoya's stipulation that Golden Boy promote any tournament fights he
is not in. In De La Hoya's fights, Golden Boy will co-promote with
Arum. Duva refuses to relinquish her promotional rights.</TE>
<TE>   "It will never happen," Duva said. "Oscar can say anything he
likes. He has his agenda and I have mine."</TE>
<TE>   * Mosley's promoter, Barry Frank, is discussing with Arum a
September De La Hoya-Mosley match. Mosley is first expected to fight
Raul Marquez Feb. 8.</TE>
<TE>   * Wright, the International Boxing Federation 154-pound champion,
would love to get in with the big boys, but Arum is balking. "What if
Winky were to qualify to fight Oscar? How could I sell that?"</TE>
<TE>   * Forrest is talking with Golden Boy officials about joining their
stable. Although he beat Mosley twice, Forrest doesn't have the name
recognition to get big fights.</TE>
<TE>   What Was He Thinking?</TE>
<TE>   With Vargas facing the Nevada State Athletic Commission on
Wednesday after testing positive for steroids, his co-manager, Shelly
Finkel, was hoping for leniency.</TE>
<TE>   So why would Finkel bring in another of his fighters, Mike Tyson,
to sit beside his friend Vargas at the hearing? Doesn't Finkel
remember the stormy hearings and bad feelings between Tyson and the
commission? Did he really think a reminder would put them in a
charitable mood?</TE>
<TE>   That is tantamount to Michael Jordan coming before NBA
Commissioner David Stern on gambling allegations and bringing Pete
Rose along as a character witness.</TE>
<TE>   Winner by the Numbers</TE>
<TE>   Erik Morales and Marco Antonio Barrera have fought two memorable
battles, each winning one. But in terms of appeal, Barrera is clearly
the winner. His fight against Johnny Tapia this month, a nontitle
fight, got an 8.1 rating on HBO, roughly the same as the two
Mosley-Forrest fights. Last week's Morales-Paulie Ayala title fight
drew 125,000 pay-per-view buys, less than half the 280,000 for
Barrera-Morales II.</TE>
<TE>   Quick Jabs</TE>
<TE>   Micky Ward (37-11, 27 knockouts) and Arturo Gatti (34-6, 28) will
stage a rematch of their memorable slugfest of May tonight (HBO,
6:45) in Atlantic City, N.J.... Lightweights Julio Diaz (25-2, 18)
and Felix St. Kitts (12-2-2, 7) will face off in the 10-round main
event tonight at the Arrowhead Pond (Channel 9, 8). The semi-main
event will match super flyweights Martin Castillo (21-1-1, 13) and
Keyri Wong (9-3-1, 9), also a 10-rounder.... Tickets are on sale for
the return of boxing to Olympic Auditorium on Jan. 18.</TE>

<LD>Kissing the donkey -- been there, done that.</LD>
<LD>   If Charles Barkley's plant of a kiss on a donkey on TV Thursday
night looked somewhat familiar, think back to last year. After the
Detroit Lions had stopped their 12-game losing streak, wide receiver
Johnnie Morton, tired of Jay Leno's jibes, declared that Leno could
kiss his behind.</LD>
<LD>   Leno gamely invited him on the show, and just as gamely, kissed
the donkey.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Barkley had said he would kiss studio partner Kenny
Smith's "cheek" if Yao Ming of the Rockets ever scored 19 points.
Smith wisely brought the donkey to the studio, and that footage was
all over CNN Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Smith joked beforehand, saying, "Sometimes even when you win, you
lose."</TE>
<TE>   Add Barkley: The National Post of Canada came up with a list of
Barkley's greatest, and not-so-greatest moments, through the years,
including:</TE>
<TE>   * "While at Auburn University, one unspecified day, Barkley tells
teammate Chuck Person he doesn't feel like practicing. 'He came into
the gym,' Person recalled, 'got a ball and dunked it so hard that he
pulled the whole support down. It landed on his head and he turned to
me and said, 'Practice is over.' "</TE>
<TE>   * "After Tonya Harding, the infamous figure skater, called herself
the Charles Barkley of her sport, Barkley responded, 'My initial
response was to sue her for defamation of character, but then I
realized that I had no character.' "</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which year did Bobby Bowden reach his first bowl game
as Florida State's coach?</TE>
<TE>   More Yao: Houston Chronicle columnist John Lopez on Yao's
30-point, 16-rebound performance Thursday in a 103-90 loss at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   " ... By the end of the game, the NBA world saw that Yao is much
more than a Chinese version of [Shawn] Bradley. It's taken Bradley 10
years in the NBA to become even a serviceable big man. It took Yao
three weeks to prove he is miles better than Bradley."</TE>
<TE>   Lasting legacy: Mick McCarthy, recently fired coach of Ireland's
national soccer team, thinks he knows what people will remember about
him -- his explosive break with central midfielder Roy Keane on the
eve of this year's World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "When I've lost my teeth and I'm an old dodderer, people will
still say, 'That's the [coach] who sent Roy Keane home from the World
Cup,' " McCarthy said.</TE>
<TE>   Soup to nuts: New York Post columnist Steve Serby on "the Chunky
curse" -- endorsers Terrell Davis, Kurt Warner and Donovan McNabb
have all been injured -- and worrying about Michael Strahan's
well-being: "Surely you've seen the Chunky soup commercial where
Strahan is riding the subway with his mother, Louise. He happens to
be the perfect spokesman: He loves the stuff.</TE>
<TE>   " 'There is no Chunky curse,' Strahan said. 'The only curse you
make is the curse you make on yourself.' "</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: 1977.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Defenseman Chris Chelios on Detroit Red Wing teammate
Jiri Fischer's severe knee injury: "He'll be back 100%. He's down,
but he'll be back. Look at me -- I'm almost 80 years old."</TE>

<HD>Clipper Loss Is Like Clockwork</HD>
<DH>Posey gets inbounds pass and sinks 18-footer as time
expires to lift Nuggets, 72-70. L.A. wastes a 16-point fourth-quarter
lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Alvin Gentry's brow furrowed. He stamped the floor with his right
foot. He smacked his hands together. He drew a technical foul.</LD>
<LD>   Chaos reigned Friday night at the Pepsi Center and Gentry was
powerless to stop it.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers and Denver Nuggets played out a basketball theater of
the absurd, with the Clippers squandering a 16-point fourth-quarter
lead en route to an unsettling 72-70 loss that ended the Nuggets'
five-game losing streak.</LD>
<TE>   James Posey's 18-foot jump shot from the left-hand corner at the
buzzer capped the Nuggets' comeback from a 66-50 deficit. Denver
outscored the Clippers, 23-8, in the fourth quarter, including by
14-0 during a pivotal stretch midway through the period that got the
Nuggets back in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Posey scored 16 points and Juwan Howard had 18 for the Nuggets
(3-9). Clipper point guard Andre Miller had 25 and assisted on
Michael Olowokandi's hook shot that tied the score, 70-70, with 11.9
seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "We stunk up the place," Gentry said after the Clippers' ninth
loss in 13 games. "I guess that's on me. I'm the coach. That's the
bottom line. They [the Nuggets] deserved to win. That's the bottom
line."</TE>
<TE>   Clipper guard Eric Piatkowski disagreed that it was Gentry's
fault. He did not disagree with Gentry's opinion of the team's
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "That's horrible," Piatkowski said. "In all my [nine] years with
the Clippers, we've managed to do that a few times. I don't remember
any recently, though. That was a meltdown in the fourth quarter. I
don't know if you could say it was [Gentry's fault]. We had a 10-man
rotation tonight. It's on the 10 guys who played."</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Gentry was asked if he was worried about his
future with the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm only worried about one thing: getting this team playing at
the level it is capable of playing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His contract is up after this season, but the team has an option
on next season.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a chance to have a special season here," Gentry added.
"The only thing I'm worried about is getting our team playing well,
seeing these guys having fun and playing at a high level.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not down. I'm not negative. I know we're not where we should
be right now, but we've still got 70 games to play [69 now]. We've
got to find a way to win eight out of nine or seven out of 10. And I
think that's what we're going to do.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to be teachers and correct their errors. We can demand
they play hard and demand they execute. That's what you do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fine. We put in a lot of hours. I am who I am. I'm not going
to change who I am. We're going to work our [tails] off and cover
every angle we can to get this thing turned around. I still believe
in this team. I won't stop believing in this team.</TE>
<TE>   "I have faith in them."</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, the Clippers activated reserve guard Quentin
Richardson from the injured list. They didn't get much from him, but
they weren't expecting him to snap three-pointers through the net and
throw down dunks in his first game after sitting out six because of a
sprained right knee.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Gentry had placed no time limit on Richardson's
play.</TE>
<TE>   After Richardson had three shots fall short of the mark in nine
minutes in the second quarter, he took a seat on the bench. He
finished the game scoreless in 18 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the first half was a forgettable display of stumbles,
bumbles, bad passes and missed shots. Still, the Clippers managed to
take a 38-33 lead by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, the Clippers have much to showcase to a national
audience, even to one nodding off by halftime of a 10:30 p.m. start
on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   But, after 24 minutes, the brain trust back at ESPN's headquarters
in Bristol, Conn., might have wanted to rethink future broadcasts of
Clipper-Nugget games.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, there's always the story line that won't go away: the future
of all those free agents at season's end and the impact all that
uncertainty might or might not have on the team's play in 2002-03.</TE>

<HD>Gentry Exercises Patience With Jaric</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Alvin Gentry isn't worried about Marko Jaric.</LD>
<LD>   "He's only shooting two or three shots a game and that's not
enough to be in a rhythm," the Clipper coach said of Jaric, a reserve
guard who was averaging 3.7 points on 14-for-51 shooting (27.5%)
before Friday's game.</LD>
<LD>   "He's feeling his way through things," Gentry added. "He's a hard
worker. He wants to be a good player. We want him to be more
aggressive offensively. He's thinking pass first, which is good.
There are certain situations where we swing him the ball and we want
him to shoot it."</LD>
<TE>   Jaric, who turns 24 on Dec. 10, is a rookie in name only. He has
played professionally in Europe since he was 18. He averaged 15.2
points in 33 games last season for his Italian club team. In
September, he helped lead Yugoslavia to the gold medal at the World
Championship in Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry isn't pleased by the Clippers' results so far, but he
continues to express satisfaction with the team's hustle. "The effort
has been there in almost all the games," he said. "We have to make
smarter plays, smarter decisions. I know we have to find a way to
close games out.... Hopefully, it's a growing process and a lesson we
learn."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson wasn't surprised to see his buddy Darius Miles
put on the injured list recently by the Cleveland Cavaliers because
of a sore knee. Richardson caught a Cavalier game on TV and knew
something was up. "I still talk to him almost every day," Richardson
said of his former teammate and childhood friend. "I watched him on
TV and saw that he wasn't jumping. He had this weak little dunk and I
said, 'He's hurt.' "</TE>

<HD>Ducks Learn They Don't Measure Up</HD>
<DH>Division-leading Stars get goals from three free agents
they added this season and rout Anaheim, 4-0. Turco gets third
shutout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks got a lesson in economics Friday night and this was
not some fuzzy math coming out of Texas.</LD>
<LD>   The Dallas Stars dipped into owner Tom Hicks' bulging wallet and
went on a buying spree. Judging by the Stars' 4-0 pounding of the
Ducks on Friday, they are better at managing money than Enron.</LD>
<LD>   An announced crowd of 12,509 at the Arrowhead Pond came out to see
if the Ducks, back from a five-game trip, could extend their recent
success. They couldn't. The Stars offered up a methodical beating and
wore them down, getting goals from three of their free-agent
signings.</LD>
<TE>   Philippe Boucher, Ulf Dahlen, Scott Young and Derian Hatcher
scored goals. Marty Turco stopped 31 shots for his third shutout of
the season, tying him for the NHL lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had picked up points in their last eight games and were
tied for second in the Pacific Division, behind Dallas. But the
distance between the two teams seemed greater.</TE>
<TE>   "We can play with this team, when we play like we're capable of
playing," Duck center Matt Cullen said. "We didn't put any pressure
on them at all."</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't an average loss for a team in its first game from the
road. The Ducks did not come out flat but seemed to match the Stars'
energy. That ebbed as the game progressed and goalie Jean-Sebastien
Giguere paid the price, often being left hung out to dry.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had only 13 shots through the first 40 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "They played well, but we didn't do much to counter it," Cullen
said. "We're not going to win when we play like that, especially
against a team like that."</TE>
<TE>   Turco made sure of that. He was considered a risky venture for the
Stars when they allowed goalie Eddie Belfour to leave after last
season. Turco has responded, achieving the third lowest goals-against
average in the NHL before Friday's game.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks didn't challenge Turco much. His biggest save came when
he smothered a point-blank try by rookie Alexei Smirnov, who had
broken through the Stars' defense early in the third period with the
score 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   "The big question mark coming in was his maturity and his maturity
level is going every day," Dallas Coach Dave Tippett said. "He wants
to be the guy. He wants to be an elite goaltender in this league. But
there is more to it than just saying that. He's proving he can do
it."</TE>
<TE>   While saturating the free-agent market with American dollars
doesn't guarantee success -- see the New York Rangers as Exhibit A --
using cash wisely certain helps.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher, who played the last seven-plus season with the Kings,
signed a four-year, $9.3-million contract. Dahlen, who scored 23
goals for Washington last season, was a one-year, $1.5-million
addition. Young, whose career hit the skids in St. Louis, came south
for a two-year, $7-million deal.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher, making his return to Southern California, gave the Stars
a 1-0 lead in the first period Friday. He blasted a shot from the
blue line that beat Giguere to the right.</TE>
<TE>   Call it a warmup for tonight's homecoming against the Kings at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "I love being in L.A.," Boucher said. "I love the guys and I had a
good time here, even though there were some tough times. I went
through all kinds of ups and downs [with injuries]."</TE>
<TE>   Dahlen was jettisoned by the Capitals after last season. He had
few offers and didn't sign with the Stars until August 13th. He

<DL></DL>
<LD>Duck right wing Mike Leclerc has begun rehabilitation on his left
knee but is not sure when he can return to the lineup.</LD>
<LD>   Leclerc underwent surgery Tuesday to remove torn cartilage in the
side of his left knee. But doctors also discovered damaged cartilage
under his kneecap, which was causing pain.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors originally thought he would be out two to four weeks,
Leclerc said, but the damage under the kneecap has them concerned.</LD>
<TE>   He does not know how he injured the knee, but it had become
inflamed after games since the start of the season. He was able to
play until the Nov. 15 game at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "There had been no pain before," Leclerc said. "But I was pretty
much worthless against Detroit."</TE>
<TE>   Leclerc began strength training this week but was not sure when he
would be able to go back on the ice even just to skate. Leclerc,
whose size (6-2, 215) and skill have made one of the Ducks' top
players this season, has two goals and 11 points.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating, because the team is winning and we're having a
lot of fun," Leclerc said. "But I have been through things like this
before. This is some adversity. I'll get back and be fresh when the
guys and the rest of the NHL are a little tired."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right wing Dan Bylsma returned to the Duck lineup after being a
healthy scratch four of the last seven games. He replaced Mike Brown.</TE>

<HD>Four-Year Contract, Coach Lured Boucher to Dallas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott and Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one can blame Dallas defenseman Philippe Boucher if he's had
today's date circled ever since he read the Stars' schedule. It's the
first game against the team he left as an unrestricted free agent.</LD>
<LD>   Boucher, who signed a four-year deal with Dallas last summer, will
be in the lineup tonight for the Pacific Division-leading Stars, who
will play the Kings at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "Security was No. 1, and I wanted to go for a team that had a
chance to win. And knowing Dave Tippett helped," Boucher said of the
former King assistant and Dallas coach. "When he called me July 1, he
told me how he wanted the team to play, and it's similar to what we
did last year [with the Kings]. I knew coming in here, other than
adjusting to new players, it was not going to be a big change for
me."</LD>
<TE>   Boucher, who had seven goals and 30 points last season, was
initially disappointed that a deal couldn't be worked out with the
Kings, but now he's glad to be in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher said the Kings weren't offering a fourth year and other
teams were offering more money for a shorter term. "But I feel like I
have security now and I can try to play my best." He said. "I want to
try to have a chance to win it all. I'm not saying L.A. doesn't have
a chance, because when their whole personnel is in place they've
proved how good they are."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winger Adam Deadmarsh, who has not played in nearly two weeks, is
listed as doubtful for tonight's game because of post-concussion
syndrome. Center Jason Allison, who remains at least a month away
from returning to the lineup because of a knee injury, did some light
skating with the team Friday.</TE>

<HD>Kupchak Not Out to Deal Yet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Already, the Lakers have lost 37 player games in their regular
rotation to injury (Shaquille O'Neal, Devean George, Mark Madsen) or
suspension (Rick Fox). Robert Horry is limping and Kobe Bryant is
bandaged and Samaki Walker isn't quite right either.</LD>
<LD>   So, while three wins in three weeks for a defending champion has
been lousy, General Manager Mitch Kupchak has remained conservative.
The Lakers aren't actively shopping for a shooter or a power forward.</LD>
<LD>   "The temptation," Kupchak said, "is to overanalyze when you
shouldn't. For us to get a feel for how good this team could be, we
have to get these guys back together. There's no reason this team
can't be good enough."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, George took O'Neal's place on the injured list.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson expects George, who has tendinitis in his right
ankle, to return after the minimum five games, or close to it.</TE>
<TE>   George is eligible to return Dec. 1 against the Minnesota
Timberwolves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was on the floor two hours before game time Friday,
shooting jumpers and running through his post moves. His basketball
life changes, of course, with O'Neal's return.</TE>
<TE>   "More passing, perhaps," Jackson said of Bryant's role. "But he
still has to bring the ball to a position where he can get it to
Shaq. He doesn't have to be so concerned with the penetration aspect,
getting to the post so often, making sure he gets penetration and
pitching the ball to other players. But he has to be sure he can
shoot the ball on catch, because people will leave anybody out there
to go and double Shaq."</TE>

<HD>Shaq's Return Goes Over Big</HD>
<DH>Season looks a little different now, as O'Neal scores 17
points and Lakers end three-game losing streak with a workmanlike
86-73 victory over Bulls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the Lakers, it was good enough to have him back.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal's dominance will have to wait. Their end-to-end
game will have to wait. Their four-peat, on the shoulders of O'Neal
and Kobe Bryant in particular, is a work, they hope, in progress.</LD>
<LD>   For now, they were only too satisfied with a grinding 86-73
victory over the outmanned Chicago Bulls on Friday night at Staples
Center, where O'Neal returned from toe surgery to play 21 minutes and
score 17 points.</LD>
<TE>   They had arrived in last place in the Pacific Division, having
lost three in a row and seven of eight, and the victory, narrower
than it looked, was enough.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a ways to go," Coach Phil Jackson said of O'Neal. "But,
obviously, we got what we wanted out of him tonight, which was some
points, some minutes and a win."</TE>
<TE>   It was Bryant who carried the game offensively, starting slowly
and scoring 16 points in the third quarter, 21 overall. He also had
10 rebounds and seven assists. Derek Fisher scored 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's signature play came in the fourth quarter, with the Bulls
barely at arm's length. From 23 feet away, Rick Fox lobbed a pass a
foot over the rim that O'Neal palmed and slammed through the basket.
The backboard shook, the building rocked, and O'Neal dashed joyously
up the court, back, and feeling it.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq likes the show game," Jackson said. "He likes to style. It
brings joy to this game for us."</TE>
<TE>   He left with a little more than three minutes remaining, to the
"Superman" theme and another standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt pretty good, kind of rusty," O'Neal said. "I think we all
have to get used to playing with each other again. I'm happy for the
win, but it's not a win we should be proud of. We should beat this
team by 25."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said his surgically repaired toe felt fine, and he would
assess it today.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here now, so I'm going to keep playing," he said. "They'll
bring me along slowly, and in no time I'll be back in 100% game shape
and be ready to do what I always do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm playing with 10 toes again, so I'm trying to get used to
being out there. It was fun."</TE>
<TE>   The last time he walked off the basketball floor, on June 12 in
New Jersey, O'Neal carried a most-valuable-player trophy and a child
or two.</TE>
<TE>   It had been more than five months since, time he spent chilling in
Orlando, browsing for a surgeon, skewering the Sacramento Kings and,
finally, rehabilitating the big toe that started all of this.</TE>
<TE>   The Laker marketers played it like a movie premiere, with red
carpets and posters and Shaq in a short video based on the original
"Rocky." It was fun and the people laughed at O'Neal's over-the-top
personality.</TE>
<TE>   But what they wanted was the real Shaq, and three minutes into the
game, a good portion of the crowd chanted "We want Shaq! We want
Shaq!" and Jackson grinned and the players on the bench laughed.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of minutes later, O'Neal leaned over Tracy Murray and
asked assistant coach Kurt Rambis to ask Jackson if he was going to
play sometime soon. Jackson put his hands out -- "Be patient" -- and
12 games and 6 minutes and 47 seconds (and nine losses) into the
season, O'Neal slid off his warmup jacket and took the floor.</TE>
<TE>   The standing ovation began in the first row and spread to the
purple heavens. O'Neal licked his hands and rubbed them together,
settled in next to Tyson Chandler, and within seconds Bull Coach Bill
Cartwright thought better of the matchup.</TE>
<TE>   He was not perfect, but he was undeniably O'Neal. He made a
point-blank jump hook for his first points and scored on his first
dunk halfway through the second quarter, when he made all four of his
shots from the field. Excited, he set his face the way he does and
jerked down the floor on straightened legs, his fists balled.</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter, O'Neal was called for two goaltending
violations, the first on a short flip by Chandler, the second on
another short shot by Eddy Curry.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was a bit slow to the ball on occasion, and a bit slow off
his feet. He often has said he plays himself into basketball shape,
so all of the treadmill miles got him this far, but games will push
him the rest of the way.</TE>

<LD>The Lakers have toe-tally melted down. Four-peat? Four-get it. They
have a toehold on mediocrity. They have a size-23 foot in the cellar
door. With immediate postseason surgery, Shaquille would have been
healed. Instead, he's a heel.</LD>

<TE>   Oh, glory be. Shaq's return is imminent! We'll hail your
"resurrection," no doubt, having forgotten your selfish decision to
wait to the last possible moment to deal with your big toe (after
all, the Lakers hardly pay you enough to warrant a sacrifice of a
month or so of summer playtime).</TE>
<TE>   Good job, Big Whatever. Your allegiance to the team may well have
cost the season, not to mention your beloved fourth championship. Oh,
and Shaq, don't worry about the fans either. After all, it's really
all about Shaquille, isn't it?</TE>

<TE>   As one who follows the NBA by reading papers from several
different cities online, I want you to know that the Los Angeles
Times ought to win an award for Least Critical Coverage of the Home
Team. The latest case in point is The Times' continued fawning over
Kobe Bryant, who in the absence of Shaquille O'Neal has revealed
himself for what he truly is: a selfish, flashy but ineffective
player.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Martin</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   T.J. Simers and other Kobe fans must be in shock after watching
Kobe Bryant's stock plummet these past few weeks. Bryant has been
exposed as "the best player on a last-place team" type. He can't
carry a team the way an Allen Iverson can. It's plain to see he has
been overrated. He can blame his teammates, and they're partly to
blame. But the buck stops with the guy who makes all the money.</TE>

<TE>   The Lakers are in the Western Conference. They can't just make the
playoffs like they could if they were in the East. So buy Samaki
Walker a plane ticket and tell him to dress warmly, because Oakland
can be a bit nippy during the holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   It's not too often that you see a top rebounder, defender and
answer to a franchise's power forward-backup center problem logging
zero minutes a night on a poor team. Mitch Kupchak, your mission is
clear: Liberate Danny Fortson from the Warriors and liberate us from
Walker.</TE>

<LD>Nothing against Steve Lavin, but I've missed my favorite rants in the
Saturday letters. I hope the Bruins win the NCAA championship. May
Lavin be vindicated and be declared coach of the year.</LD>

<TE>   I am responding to T.J. Simers' Nov. 21 remarks (echoed by other
articles in The Times this week) concerning the USC athletic
department's sending representatives to make a case for the Sugar and
Orange bowls. It seems that the media are trying to create
bulletin-board material for UCLA, by characterizing USC as so
arrogant that it has already penciled in a victory against the
Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   USC's athletic department personnel are simply doing the job they
are paid to do. By flying to Miami and New Orleans, they are
promoting USC's case for a BCS bid, in the event that USC is so
fortunate as to finish with a 10-2 record.</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it, we are talking about millions of dollars here
(which will benefit the entire Pac-10). Would the local media rather
have USC be totally reactionary, and wait until Dec. 8 to start
establishing the necessary relationships? Or is it all about creating
a false impression that those who are involved in the game have no
respect for the opponent on the field?</TE>
<TE>   I applaud the work being done by the athletic department with
respect to selling our program, and I guarantee you that it has the
support of the conference commissioner and all nine other departments
(including UCLA's). Fight On!</TE>

<TE>   Does anyone know what Commissioner Tom Hansen does for the Pacific
10 Conference? While recently glancing over bowl schedules, I noticed
that the Pac-10 is the only conference to send one team to play on
New Year's Day.</TE>
<TE>   Our wonderful commissioner has elected to send our second-best
team to San Diego to play in the coveted Dec. 27 time slot against
the No. 3 Big 12 team. This is atrocious. The SEC has five teams that
play Jan. 1 or later, the Big Ten has three teams and even the weak
ACC and Big East send two teams to play on New Year's Day or later.</TE>
<TE>   New Year's is the biggest day in college football and someone over
in the commissioner's office needs to get on the ball and realize
that the Pac-10 isn't the Mountain West or the WAC.</TE>

for which side did Barnes actually play? Harvard or Yale?</TE>

<LD>As a lifelong Clipper fan, I rue the day the Donald bought the team,
curse the day he moved it to L.A. and long for the day when it's put
into capable hands.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, what a day it will be. (Picture, if you will, a franchise not
owned by the Worst Owner in Sports, where the team, not the owner, is
the story.) What a vision. That being said, the incessant whining
about contract status, and reporting of same, is idiotic. The Donald
and his merry henchmen have assembled a talented team. It appears the
individuals on that team fail to grasp the fact that if they win,
they'll get national publicity, and they'll all make significantly
more in next summer's free-agent market.</LD>
<LD>   It's not the Donald's fault this team is trying to eliminate
itself from playoff contention in November. Blame Alvin Gentry (for
twice calling Olowokandi's name with the game on the line, and for
putting the selfish Keyon Dooling on the floor at critical
junctures), blame the players, but (for this one time only) give the
owner a break.</LD>

<LD>Jesse Jackson is going to save the sport of golf from "apartheid" by
picketing Augusta National during the Masters. Augusta is a private
club with a membership from all over the country. It is only open a
few months a year. It is not the typical country club to which women
have been accepted as full members for years. There is no "business"
justification for admitting women, an excuse that has removed the few
refuges for men who would like to get away from women for a few hours
a day.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Country Club, for many years and maybe to this day,
did not accept anyone in the entertainment business for membership.
The sole exception was Randolph Scott, who had made most of his money
in real estate and who said he could provide sworn affidavits that he
was not an actor. He also had a two handicap.</LD>

<TE>   I'm confused about Jesse Jackson's claim of apartheid at Augusta.
I am a white Jewish man who is the son of a woman who marched with
Martin Luther King Jr. on Washington and from Selma to Montgomery.
She lived under the premise that there was one people with one color.
I am convinced she and Rev. King are rolling over in their graves as
they watch Mr. Jackson practice his double standards and racism as he
perpetuates his sick ideas to further his own personal agenda.</TE>
<TE>   How does Mr. Jackson view the "apartheid" of events and
organizations such as "Miss Black America," "The Black Airline Pilots
Assn.," "Black Student Unions" or "Black Entertainment Television"?</TE>
<TE>   Can you imagine the uproar by Jackson if the word "black" were
replaced by "white" in these titles and others like them?</TE>

<TE>   Please, please, please! Will the media please leave Hootie
Johnson, Tiger Woods and anyone else involved in the Masters alone!
The New York Times thinks Tiger Woods shouldn't show up to play in
the biggest tournament in the world to make a statement? Who exactly
would benefit from this? Tiger Woods does not run the Masters. Tiger
Woods is not even a voting member of Augusta National. Asking Tiger
to boycott the Masters is like asking the sun not to shine. Not gonna
happen. Why does the New York Times even care?</TE>
<TE>   And seemingly every sportswriter out there has a cute,
simile-laden opinion on how to overthrow Johnson and allow women into
the club. Stop it! It ain't your club. It ain't your tournament.
Cover something more interesting. The media are creating this whole
mess when it really is a private disagreement between a man and a
woman. Let them handle it themselves. I'm tired of hearing about it.</TE>

<LD>Did all the ex-Enron and Arthur Andersen accountants end up with jobs
in major league baseball? The Colorado Rockies trade Mike Hampton to
Florida, which trades him to Atlanta without even the courtesy photo
in the new Marlin jersey. I get it this far, but then it gets murky.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next three seasons, Colorado will pay Hampton $6.5
million to pitch for Atlanta; Florida will pay Hampton $23.5 million
to pitch for Atlanta; Atlanta will pay Hampton $5.5 million to pitch.
What is wrong with this math? Because of Colorado's and Florida's
generosity, Atlanta has added a starting pitcher, at an unheard-of $2
million a year, and has improved its chances of re-signing Tom
Glavine and/or Greg Maddux.</LD>
<LD>   Because Commissioner Bud Selig has no trouble with this kind of
financial shenanigan, we can only guess how bad the stuff is that he
doesn't want disclosed.</LD>

<LD>Taking things one game at a time has worked so well for the Indiana
Pacers that they're off to the best start in franchise history after
nine consecutive victories.</LD>
<LD>   "I haven't mentioned it one time. I just want to win every
basketball game we play," Coach Isiah Thomas said Friday night as the
Pacers beat Orlando, 106-70, at Indianapolis to improve to an Eastern
Conference-leading 10-1.</LD>
<LD>   Ron Artest had 15 points and held NBA scoring leader Tracy McGrady
20 points under his average as Indiana bettered the 9-1 start by the
1969-70 Pacers in the old American Basketball Assn.</LD>
<TE>   McGrady, who came in with a 33.2 average after scoring at least 30
in a team-record seven straight games, had eight points in the first
half and finished with 13 on six-for-19 shooting with five turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 105, Atlanta 98 -- Paul Pierce scored 36 points, including
four straight in the second overtime at Boston to give the Celtics
the lead for good.</TE>
<TE>   The teams went into the second overtime tied at 94-94 after Pierce
was unable to convert on a drive to the basket with one second left
in the first overtime. Tony Battie gave the Celtics a 96-94 lead, and
Shareef Abdur-Rahim tied the score before Pierce made consecutive
shots to put the Celtics up for good.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 93, Washington 86 -- Yao Ming scored 18 points and blocked
three shots in his first NBA start, and substitute starter Juaquin
Hawkins, a former Long Beach State standout, led a third-quarter
spurt.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins, starting for injured guard Cuttino Mobley, had
consecutive three-point baskets to end the quarter as Houston took a
75-61 lead into the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 105, New York 97 -- Jamal Mashburn scored 25 points
and Jamaal Magloire and P.J. Brown each scored 20 and the Hornets
remained unbeaten at home with an overtime win.</TE>
<TE>   Brown had 10 rebounds for his seventh double-double of the season,
and Magloire grabbed 11 for his second double-double in two games.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 118, Phoenix 101 -- Bobby Jackson scored 24 points to
lead six players in double figures as the Kings won their fourth in a
row and improved to 7-0 at home. Stephon Marbury scored 39 points for
Phoenix, including six three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 95, Golden State 91 -- Ray Allen scored 31 points and
made a key three-pointer down the stretch as the Bucks hung on to
defeat the Warriors at Oakland. Erick Dampier had a career-high 31
points and 14 rebounds for Golden State.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 120, Cleveland 79 -- Kenyon Martin had 21 points and 10
rebounds and the Nets made 14 of their first 15 shots to cruise at
East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 75, Miami 72 -- Richard Hamilton scored 17 points and Ben
Wallace had a season-high 22 rebounds at Miami as the Pistons beat
the Heat for the second time in three nights.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 90, Toronto 80 -- Allen Iverson scored 31 points and
Keith Van Horn had 13 points and 10 rebounds at Philadelphia as the
76ers won for the fifth time in six games, improving to 7-0 at home.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 95, Memphis 86 -- Tim Duncan had 28 points and 15
rebounds at San Antonio as the Spurs beat the Grizzlies for the 21st

<HD>Tippett Gets Stars Aligned in First Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sense, Dave Tippett has been preparing to be the head coach of
the Dallas Stars since he was a kid in the southeastern Saskatchewan
town of Moosomin.</LD>
<LD>   He'd be at the rink early in the morning and didn't leave until
darkness blanketed the Canadian prairie. Even then, hockey was
everything to him. The rest was what you did until you could play
hockey again.</LD>
<LD>   "I've probably been that way since I was 3 years old," he said.
"In Canada, we call it a rink rat. That's what most coaches are, rink
rats."</LD>
<TE>   Never did he leave a rink without learning something, whether
junior hockey, the University of North Dakota or the NHL, where he
was a fine defensive forward for 11 seasons with the Hartford
Whalers, Washington Capitals, Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia
Flyers.</TE>
<TE>   As an assistant to King Coach Andy Murray for three seasons, the
diligent checker had to become creative and devise power-play
strategy. He did it so well, the post-Rob Blake Kings had the NHL's
most potent power play last season, up from 24th before he arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I came to L.A., I wouldn't have considered myself a
power-play guru," said Tippett, who signed a three-year contract with
the Stars in May. "The way Andy set up the staff, I was the
offensive, power-play guy and Mark [Hardy] was the penalty-killing
guy. It was great for us because we got a lot of responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   The ultimate responsibility is now his, and he carries it as if
born to it.</TE>
<TE>   Tippett is quick to downplay suggestions that the Stars, who
missed the playoffs last spring, are destined to go far this season
because they have a league-leading 31 points after defeating the
Mighty Ducks, 4-0, Friday at the Arrowhead Pond. "Game 22 is not
going to decide the division, I guarantee you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   No, but he has invigorated a team numbed by too many
paint-blistering tirades by his predecessor, Ken Hitchcock, who would
tell players which direction to point their skates in the neutral
zone but couldn't communicate on a personal level.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I think Hitch really didn't understand that players
make mistakes," defenseman Derian Hatcher said. "Tip understands. He
played the game and he relates to players and knows what they go
through."</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock, who led the Stars to the Stanley Cup in 1999 with a
dogged devotion to defense, surely would have raged Wednesday after
the team squandered a 2-0 lead en route to a 2-2 tie at Phoenix.
Tippett calmly told players that one point was better than nothing
and they'd make up for it at Anaheim and against the Kings tonight at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows there's enough experience and leadership in the room
that if he's not saying something, someone else is," defenseman
Richard Matvichuk said. "The guys we have here have won
championships. They know when to say something.</TE>
<TE>   "With a new coach and some new personnel, this has been a fresh
start for all of us. That's what the organization needed.... There's
no separation between the coaching staff and players. We've really
jelled as a team."</TE>
<TE>   He is calm by nature, not an attitude he assumed to become the
anti-Hitchcock.</TE>
<TE>   "Tip's a real smart hockey mind, and his people skills are real
good," Murray said after chatting with him Friday morning. "Dallas is
just a great fit for Dave, and I told him that when he looked at the
job."</TE>
<TE>   Above all, he's always prepared, the hallmark of a guy who made it
on smarts and effort rather than sheer talent.</TE>
<TE>   When he interviewed with Stars' General Manager Doug Armstrong, he
brought a 20-page outline of his philosophy and his evaluation of the
Stars.</TE>
<TE>   Such attention to detail helped Tippett, who had led Houston of
the International Hockey League to the 1999 Turner Cup championship,
beat out Hitchcock -- who had reapplied for the job -- and former NHL
coaches Ted Nolan, Pat Burns and Terry Murray.</TE>
<TE>   It is a job any coach would covet. He has superb resources in
center Mike Modano, $45-million free agent winger Bill Guerin and a
deep defense led by Matvichuk, Hatcher, Sergei Zubov and former King
Philippe Boucher. And he has kept them happy and productive while
getting the most from a strong supporting cast.</TE>
<TE>   Modano, alternately Hitchcock's pet and whipping boy, likes
Tippett's style.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very quiet as a guy. He's really enjoying this opportunity,
and we as players were welcoming to the overall change," said Modano,
one of the NHL's top scorers with eight goals and 25 points. "Dave
has played the game and he understands certain situations.... He's
left a lot up to us as far as players and our captains to try to
prepare ourselves and get the team ready. He adds his points as far
as what we need to focus on. Our meetings are maybe five, not even 10
minutes long. I think that allows us more time to prepare ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Tippett credited Murray and the Kings for propelling him up the
career ladder.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a great deal of respect for the Kings' organization.
Everything they do is first class," he said. "It's an honor for me to
come back here and say I was part of that."</TE>
<TE>   The wish Tippett cherished for so long has come true, but wishes
have a way of falling short of expectations. He's not likely to let
that happen.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be a player, first. But after, the game intrigued me
and from there, you just let yourself go," he said. "As a young
player I was never drafted or anything. One thing I told myself was I
was going to play at the highest level that I can until I don't want
to play or somebody tells me I can't play. That's what I did. I
decided I didn't want to play any more and started to coach. I said,
'I'm going to do this. I think I can do it well and I'm going to keep
doing it until I see where it takes me.' "</TE>

<PH>THE RIVALRY  / USC vs. UCLA</PH>
<KH>Bill Plaschke</KH>
<HD>Walking the Talk</HD>
<DH>Two old friends of the rivalry take a daily stroll at the
Rose Bowl</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Nice Halloween suit," says Manuel.</LD>
<LD>   "Better than your sissy blue," says Victor.</LD>
<LD>   It is a fine Friday morning for two frumpy old men, shrugging and
sighing and beginning a walk they have made every weekday morning for
the last four years.</LD>
<TE>   Around the Rose Bowl. Side by side. Wearing their colors.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Verdugo, 66, dresses in UCLA's.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Martinez, 68, dresses in USC's.</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "Do your athletes really pay people to take tests for
them?"</TE>
<TE>   Answers Victor: "Somebody should pay your athletes to take a
drivers' education class, especially the chapter on handicapped
parking."</TE>
<TE>   For four years, they have been a startling contradiction to those
who have passed them on the three-mile loop, cardinal red walking
with powder blue, one guy waving two taunting fingers while the other
guy throws up a hand in disgust.</TE>
<TE>   They always walk counterclockwise.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel usually walks on the outside.</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "So I can protect my Trojan grandfather."</TE>
<TE>   Says Victor: "A car hits him, the next thing he knows, Satan is
asking him, 'Who gave you that ugly shirt?' "</TE>
<TE>   They are two retired factory workers who began walking together
for their health.</TE>
<TE>   But today, they are much more.</TE>
<TE>   Today, they are symbolic of a city that, for the 72nd time,
embarks upon a taunting, teasing, wonderful neighborhood stroll.</TE>
<TE>   USC versus UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   A hometown against itself, yet grandly together, all in the same
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The best rivalry in college football, because it's the only one
that never leaves town.</TE>
<TE>   The actual football teams will spend three hours together in the
Rose Bowl. But the real rivalry is about what has been happening the
rest of the year, on the streets outside.</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "USC is a bunch of spoiled kids."</TE>
<TE>   Says Victor: "Bruins are cheapskates. When is the last time you've
bought me coffee?"</TE>
<TE>   The frumpy old men are like thousands whose relationships have
been polarized by today's game.</TE>
<TE>   They are the best of old friends.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it's a miracle they haven't killed each other.</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "We will win this year if we give the ball to that
little mouse."</TE>
<TE>   Says Victor: "You will win only if we don't show up."</TE>
<TE>   For years they had worked at a dairy plant, where they brushed up
against each other enough to know about their loyalties.</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "It was fun, reminding him about the Bruin winning
streak."</TE>
<TE>   Says Victor: "What winning streak?"</TE>
<TE>   They retired, went their separate ways, then one day spotted each
other on the loop.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel had been ordered to walk because of a bad back.</TE>
<TE>   Victor had been ordered to walk because of a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   It was a match made, if not in heaven, then certainly only in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "I saw him in his USC stuff and I asked him, 'Did you
raid the Dumpster again?' "</TE>
<TE>   Says Victor: "I saw him and felt sorry for him."</TE>
<TE>   So they walked, and talked, and soon they were doing it every
weekday, so much that the Rose Bowl's morning community of joggers
and walkers and bikers began to notice.</TE>
<TE>   When Victor doesn't show up because of an illness or doctor's
appointment, people notice.</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "I tell them, 'He feels so bad about the Trojans, he
could no longer go on living.' "</TE>
<TE>   And when Manuel misses ...</TE>
<TE>   Says Victor: "I tell them, 'He is ashamed, like all Bruins are
ashamed.' "</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "I am proud. That victory bell will be having blue
paint on it this year."</TE>
<TE>   Says Victor: "It will be kind of hard to cover the three coats of
red paint."</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "Not any harder than when it had eight coats of blue
paint."</TE>
<TE>   Every day the jibes go back and forth, rips of Bob Toledo, pokes
at Pete Carroll, talk of bad referees and great finishes.</TE>
<TE>   Not discussed, however, are old school days.</TE>
<TE>   Because neither man actually went to his favorite school.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, neither man even went to college.</TE>
<TE>   That's another reason this rivalry rocks. You don't need a student
loan or transcript to participate.</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "I've loved UCLA since the time I went there as a
young man, for parties. Oh, the booze and the women! Oh my!"</TE>
<TE>   Says Victor: "It figures."</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "At least UCLA is a school with life."</TE>
<TE>   Says Victor: "When I was growing up, we used to go to the Coliseum
to sell programs. I would walk across the street and see the football
players warming up. Man, that was something. All that tradition. I
wanted to be part of that."</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "Tradition? You got rid of John Robinson."</TE>
<TE>   Says Victor: "So? We also got rid of Bob Toledo."</TE>
<TE>   Another thing they don't discuss is their seats for the game.</TE>
<TE>   They have never gone together. They have never even watched it on
television together.</TE>
<TE>   They will stay home today, with their families as usual, holler
for three hours, then prepare their best insults and excuses for when
they meet again Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Many other rivalries are about one day. USC-UCLA is about a
lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "Then it will start again for another year."</TE>
<TE>   Says Victor: "It's going to be hard, him listening to me talk
about the victory."</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "UCLA wins, 28-25."</TE>
<TE>   Says Victor: "USC wins, 28-10."</TE>
<TE>   As they approach their cars, their lap finished, they casually
mention that all the walking has improved Manuel's back and helped
Victor's heart.</TE>
<TE>   And, says Manuel: "This is really good for us in other ways."</TE>
<TE>   Says Victor: "We talk about things other than football.... "</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in the walk, there is a quiet pause.</TE>
<TE>   Says Manuel: "Um, yeah ... we also talk about how you guys never
won anything in basketball."'</TE>

<HD>China Opts to Go Dutch for Its National Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking a leaf out of South Korea's book, China turned to a Dutch
coach on Friday to lead its national team.</LD>
<LD>   Arie Haan, a midfielder on the Netherlands' teams that reached the
World Cup final in 1974 and 1978, was named to replace Bora
Milutinovic, who led China to the World Cup for the first time in
2002.</LD>
<LD>   "The reason that Haan has been appointed is that his salary
demands were moderate," the Beijing Evening News reported.</LD>
<TE>   Since retiring as a player, Haan, 54, has coached teams in the
Netherlands, Greece, Austria, Germany and Saudi Arabia. He said the
China opportunity was too tempting to pass up.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not want to be telling myself in two or three years' time,
'You idiot, why didn't you take up this offer,' " Haan told the
German newspaper Stuttgarter Nachrichten.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea reached the World Cup semifinals this year under Dutch
coach Guus Hiddink.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz Azul Qualifies</TE>
<TE>   Uruguayan striker Sebastian Abreu headed in three goals in a
13-minute span to lead Cruz Azul to a 4-0 victory over Venezuela's
Nacional Tachira in Mexico City on Thursday night and secure the
Mexican team a place in next year's Copa Libertadores tournament in
South America.</TE>
<TE>   Another Mexican club, UNAM, can also qualify by defeating or tying
Cruz Azul in its final qualifying game next week.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmots to Retire</TE>
<TE>   Marc Wilmots, the former captain of Belgium's national team,
announced that he will retire at the end of this season, ending an
18-year career that has seen him play in three World Cups and score
28 goals in 70 games for his country.</TE>
<TE>   The 33-year-old forward, currently with Schalke 04 of the German
Bundesliga, on Thursday became only the fourth soccer player to win
Belgium's top sporting honor, the Trophee du Merite Sportif.</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United's proposed tour of the United States next summer
moved a step closer to realization when George Zoffinger, chief
executive of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, told the
Bergen County Record that the English Premier League team will
probably play Juventus at Giants Stadium on July 30 or 31.</TE>
<TE>   Matches also are being planned for Seattle, Los Angeles and
Foxboro, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Big Numbers</TE>
<TE>   Television coverage of the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea
reached 213 countries and totaled 41,100 hours of programming,
according to the final report on TV viewing commissioned by FIFA's
television partner, KirchSport in Germany, and compiled by Sports
Marketing Surveys, a British research agency.</TE>
<TE>   The cumulative audience for the World Cup's 64 games was 28.8
billion, making the tournament "the most extensively covered and
viewed event in television history," FIFA said on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrate or Sit</TE>
<TE>   An unusual, not to say bizarre, squabble has arisen in Brazil
between forward Claudio "Pitbull" Mejolaro and Ricardo Gomes, his
coach at Juventude.</TE>
<TE>   Juventude plays Gremio in the quarterfinals of the Brazilian
championship on Sunday, and Mejolaro, who is playing at Juventude on
loan from Gremio, is refusing to celebrate if he scores a goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not celebrating," Mejolaro told Reuters. "I know the Gremio
supporters like me, and this is my way of showing respect to them."</TE>
<TE>   Snapped Gomes: "If he doesn't change his attitude, he won't play."</TE>

<HD>Sluggish USC Gets Past UCR</HD>
<DH>Bibby says Trojans lack urgency in 81-67 opening win.
Craven twins held out 13 minutes after showing up late.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week USC Coach Henry Bibby was lamenting the propensity of his
leading returning scorer, Errick Craven, to get bored in practice,
calling the sophomore shooting guard "his own worst enemy sometimes."</LD>
<LD>   Craven acknowledged that the monotony of scrimmaging was beginning
to get to him, saying that although he enjoyed his teammates'
company, he was getting antsy for a real game.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, though, his car was not as antsy. After showing up
five minutes late to the Sports Arena with his twin brother, Derrick,
for the Trojans' season opener against UC Riverside Friday night,
Bibby benched both Cravens for the first 13-plus minutes of USC's
81-67 victory in front of 3,127.</LD>
<TE>   Despite not entering the game until the 6:39 mark, after eight
other Trojans had hit the floor, Errick finished with a Trojan-high
22 points and a career-high five assists in 24 minutes. Derrick,
meanwhile, blew a shot at starting at point guard and was the lone
Trojan to not score.</TE>
<TE>   "It was frustrating. I'm not used to sitting on the bench at the
opening tip, so I was cold coming into the game," said Errick Craven,
who blamed traffic for their tardiness. "But you've got to come out
and bounce back."</TE>
<TE>   Derrick Craven said he was shell-shocked at missing his starting
opportunity as senior Robert Hutchinson got the nod instead.</TE>
<TE>   "That took my whole mental game away," he said after finishing
with no assists, four turnovers and one steal in 15 minutes. "As a
point guard, you've got to be mentally in the game and I was off in
my own little world.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just going to make sure I'm never late for another game."</TE>
<TE>   And even with the win, Bibby wasn't so sure the rest of his team
didn't take time off as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of the worst performances we've had since I've been
here," Bibby said. "We had no urgency. We didn't move the ball. We
missed easy shots and we didn't defend. We didn't do anything to
deserve to win."</TE>
<TE>   Freshman guard Nate Carter's 23 points led UC Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby was hopeful that his young team, which has just two seniors,
got his message.</TE>
<TE>   "You hope so, but this is a different breed of kid we're dealing
with in this day and time," he said. "And I call the shots."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A second MRI of junior forward Jerry Dupree's sore right heel was
inconclusive and Dupree has been advised to stay off the foot and
prescribed crutches for the next two weeks, Dupree said Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Dupree, who is serving a six-game suspension handed down by Bibby,
has also read the Internet rumors that have his USC career coming to
an inglorious end.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going anywhere," he said, adding that his schoolwork has
picked up since the start of the semester.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UP NEXT FOR USC</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday at Rhode Island (1-0), 4:30 p.m. PST -- In their first
visit to Rhode Island, the Trojans (1-0) will help the Rams christen
their new $54-million arena, the Ryan Center. USC and Rhode Island
have split two previous meetings, the Trojans winning, 82-54, last
December at the Sports Arena and the Rams winning the third-place
game of Hawaii's Rainbow Classic, 87-74, in 1995.</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>This Trip Won't Be a Cross-Town Bust</HD>
<DH>Trojans, Bruins riding win streaks, with a possible New
Year's return to Pasadena on the line.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The counterfeit rivalry has gone legit.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time since 1993, both USC and UCLA are ranked on the
day they meet. Both are on winning streaks. Both are headed to bowl
games. Both, in fact, are regarded as something they haven't been in
a long time.</LD>
<LD>   Money teams.</LD>
<TE>   "Normally it's just a rivalry, but now a lot could come out of it
for them and a lot could come out for us," USC quarterback Carson
Palmer said. "So it makes it more important."</TE>
<TE>   This time, the game is about more than bragging rights that the
winners are too embarrassed to exercise.</TE>
<TE>   It's about more than a victory bell with a hollow ring.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody needs kid himself about salvaging a disastrous season by
claiming, "This is our Rose Bowl." The winner could catapult to the
real deal.</TE>
<TE>   If No. 7 USC wins, having sent administrators to court Orange Bowl
and Sugar Bowl officials last week doesn't appear so extravagant.
Only a game against Notre Dame will stand in the way of a BCS
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   If No. 25 UCLA wins, the prospect of a bargain-basement bowl
experience, such as Christmas with an Elvis Santa Claus in Las Vegas,
is eliminated. And a bit of cooperation from Washington could have
the Bruins smelling roses on New Year's Day.</TE>
<TE>   "It means more than the last several years because there is
something more than the game at stake," UCLA linebacker Marcus Reese
said. "We can knock off their little national championship hopes.
That would feel real good. Whoever wins is riding high."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans have won the last three games. UCLA won the previous
eight. But it has been a long time since both teams came in with
momentum.</TE>
<TE>   USC was 17-19 over the last three seasons, which muted the
bragging rights that normally accompany beating the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't very good, so it's not like they could say much,"
Reese said. "We go to the same parties all the time and there wasn't
much talking."</TE>
<TE>   This time, the winners can shout it out. A victory will add
flourish to an outstanding season.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans (8-2, 6-1) are favored, and for good reason. Make that
10,200 reasons.</TE>
<TE>   That's how many more yards Palmer has passed for in his career
than UCLA freshmen Drew Olson and Matt Moore combined.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer has thrown 1,470 passes. Olson and Moore have thrown 81.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer has thrown for 63 touchdowns. Olson and Moore for one each.</TE>
<TE>   The teams are roughly even in every other phase. But Palmer, a
Heisman Trophy candidate, gives the Trojans a clear advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Five times a freshman quarterback has started for UCLA against
USC. Only once, with Cade McNown in 1995, did the Bruins win.</TE>
<TE>   The last time UCLA beat USC, in 1998, Palmer was a freshman. No
coincidence there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough because you don't understand what the game is all
about," he said. "You go in hating UCLA and they go in hating USC,
but you don't understand how much hate there is until you experience
it."</TE>
<TE>   Olson, who will start, and Moore, who also is expected to play,
have exhibited senior poise in leading the Bruins (7-3, 4-2) to three
consecutive victories, two on the road.</TE>
<TE>   But they will be subjected to untold intensity today. Are they
ready? Can they even tell?</TE>
<TE>   Olson grew up in the Bay Area, and one theory presented this week
is that he will be oblivious to the pressure because he knows little
about the rivalry. But his father attended UCLA and Olson worshipped
the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched the game on TV and had a pretty good idea of what it
meant," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Moore grew up in Santa Clarita and experienced the rivalry up
close.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they'll do fine," Bruin Coach Bob Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have to win the football game for us, anyway. It's
about the entire team and the coaches. They just need to do their
part, and they understand that."</TE>
<TE>   True enough, quarterbacks often aren't the heroes in this rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, quarterback John Barnes led a dramatic UCLA victory in 1992,
but Trojan defensive lineman George Achica, Bruin running back Ricky
Davis and Trojan defensive back Antuan Simmons are names that
unexpectedly became cemented in the game's lore.</TE>
<TE>   Who could be added to the list today?</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody is going to jump out," USC Coach Pete Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   It could be a ballcarrier who once was a starter and now must
seize any opportunity. Maybe fullback Chad Pierson of USC takes a
screen pass and rambles for a touchdown. Maybe tailback Akil Harris
of UCLA breaks loose on a draw.</TE>
<TE>   It could be a reserve cornerback who will be picked on as soon as
he spells a starter. Maybe freshman James Wyatt of USC or senior Joe
Hunter of UCLA intercepts a pass and sets up a pivotal score.</TE>
<TE>   It could be a kicker who lost his job. UCLA's Chris Griffith, who
has been replaced by Nate Fikse, has kicked 42 field goals in his
career. USC's David Davis, now backing up Ryan Killeen, made 15 of 18
field goals last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm preparing just like I'm going to play," Griffith said. "You
never know."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the greatest motivation is that of the seniors. A Trojan
group of 23 that includes Troy Polamalu, Kareem Kelly and Darrell
Rideaux has never lost to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   A Bruin group of 14 that includes Reese, Ricky Manning and Mike
Saffer does not wish to become the first class in 23 years to lose
four in a row to USC.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to get the golden sombrero," Manning said. "I won't
be thinking about any of the history when the game starts, though.
There's more at stake than in any of those other games, and winning
would mean more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Gary Klein contributed to this report.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Choice Stakes</TE>
<TE>   What's on the line today:</TE>
<TE>   * USC still has a shot at a BCS bowl game with victories today and
next Saturday over Notre Dame. The Trojans also could qualify for the
Rose Bowl with a victory over UCLA, if Washington State loses its
last two games or qualifies for the national championship game.</TE>
<TE>   * UCLA would go to the Rose Bowl if it defeats USC today,
Washington beats Washington State today, then the Bruins defeat the
Cougars on Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   * Bragging rights: USC has won the last three meetings, after UCLA
won eight in a row.</TE>
<TE>   * Trophy dash: Carson Palmer can keep his Heisman hopes alive with
strong efforts against UCLA and Notre Dame.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The series' rich history of dramatic plays is a big part of what
makes the USC-UCLA rivalry so special.</LD>
<LD>   Fans of either program can recall where they were when O.J.
Simpson weaved through the Bruin defense for a game-winning 64-yard
touchdown run in 1967, or when Karl Morgan sacked Scott Tinsley to
send UCLA to the Rose Bowl in 1982.</LD>
<LD>   My memories go back only so far, but here's my list of five
memorable plays over the last half of the 73-year-old series:</LD>
<TE>   No. 5 -- It's understandable if former USC quarterback Rob Johnson
gets a little queasy when he thinks about playing UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   After throwing incomplete on a two-point conversion attempt in a
38-37 loss to the Bruins in 1992, Johnson had a chance to redeem
himself the next season -- only to come up short again before 93,458
at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   On third and goal from the UCLA two-yard line, with the Trojans
down by six points, Johnson tried to force a play called "Bruin Pass"
into the end zone. Strong safety Marvin Goodwin intercepted with 50
seconds remaining, protecting the Bruins' 27-21 victory, which ended
UCLA's 10-game losing streak to USC when the Rose Bowl was on the
line for both schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I said before the season, this would not be a successful season
if we didn't beat UCLA," Johnson said after the game, which sent the
Trojans to the Freedom Bowl. "It wasn't a successful season."</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 -- In 1987, USC defeated UCLA, 17-13, on a juggling end zone
catch by Erik Affholter for a 33-yard touchdown with 7:59 to play in
front of 92,516 at the Coliseum. But Affholter would not have had a
chance to be a hero if not for a first-class hustle play by USC
quarterback Rodney Peete on the last play of the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   With UCLA ahead, 10-0, the Trojans were on the move, but Peete
threw an interception on first and goal from the Bruin five-yard
line. Peete was trying to hit Ken Henry in the left corner of the end
zone, but the ball was deflected by UCLA linebacker Marvcus Patton
into the hands of safety Eric Turner</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the end zone," said Turner, a former high school track
standout. "I saw daylight. I thought I was gone."</TE>
<TE>   But just when it looked as if Turner would score a back-breaking
touchdown for UCLA, Peete ran him down as the clock ticked down to
0:00 and made the tackle at the USC 11-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 -- UCLA running back Skip Hicks will always be remembered
for ending the highest-scoring game of the rivalry with his overtime
touchdown run in 1996 in front of 80,644 at the Rose Bowl. But the
Bruins would not have won, 48-41, in double overtime if not for a key
defensive play by Danjuan Magee and Kusanti Abdul-Salaam.</TE>
<TE>   USC had led, 38-21, early in the fourth quarter and still had a
seven-point lead and the ball in UCLA territory with only 2:49
remaining. But on first down, Magee ripped the ball out of the hands
of USC running back LaVale Woods. When UCLA's Phillip Ward failed to
pick up the fumble, Abdul-Salaam did and returned it 11 yards to the
UCLA 44. Four plays later, Hicks ran 11 yards to tie the score at 38
with 39 seconds remaining, setting the stage for his game-winning
25-yard run in overtime, which extended UCLA's winning streak over
USC to six games.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 -- Former USC Coach John McKay said this about Simpson's
fourth-quarter touchdown run against the Bruins in 1967: "It was a
five-yard run that turned into something else. It was one of the
greatest runs that I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Simpson's historic run before 90,722 at the Coliseum was triggered
by USC fullback Danny Scott's textbook block. On third and eight from
the USC 36, Trojan quarterback Steve Sogge called an audible for a
basic run, with Simpson following Scott into the left side of the
line.</TE>
<TE>   Scott, a transfer from Cerritos College, made sure the play was a
success when he crushed UCLA linebacker Don Manning past the line of
scrimmage, springing Simpson into the Bruins' secondary.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 -- You can pretty much count on a trick play whenever USC
and UCLA meet, and the Trojans took it to a new level in 1981 before
89,432 at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   USC nose guard George Achica became the hero of the game when he
ended UCLA's Rose Bowl dreams by blocking Norm Johnson's 46-yard
field goal attempt as time expired, preserving a 22-21 Trojan
victory. But the play that sticks in the mind occurred earlier, when
USC Coach John Robinson dug deep into his playbook to come up with a
flanker-reverse pass.</TE>
<TE>   With UCLA ahead, 7-6, in the second quarter, USC quarterback John
Mazur handed off to tailback Marcus Allen, who gave the ball to wide
receiver Tim White. With the defense scrambling to recover, White
completed a pass to Jeff Simmons for 48 yards to the UCLA seven-yard
line.</TE>
<TE>   That was part of a long line of unusual plays both teams have used
over the years. Sometimes they work. Sometimes they don't. Just one
more reason why the USC-UCLA series is always something special.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, by the way, White, a former high school quarterback who
completed all four of his passes for 197 yards and two touchdowns in
his USC career, is my brother.</TE>

<LD>Top-ranked Miami will be without wide receiver Kevin Beard and backup
defensive end Cornelius Green for the rest of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Both players suffered torn anterior cruciate ligaments in their
right knees, Coach Larry Coker said Friday. Beard and Green were
helped off the field in the second quarter of Thursday night's 28-21
victory over No. 17 Pittsburgh, and tests Friday confirmed the
seriousness of the injuries.</LD>
<LD>   "That's a blow to our football team, and a blow to them," Coker
said.</LD>
<TE>   Beard, a junior, is third on the team in receiving with 23 catches
for 262 yards and four touchdowns. Green, one of six seniors on
Miami's highly regarded defensive line, has 35 tackles, six sacks and
10 quarterback hurries.</TE>

<TE>   Arkansas tight end Jason Peters was cited for disorderly conduct
for urinating in a parking lot in Fayetteville but still made the

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The LPGA Tour season comes to an end this weekend, and Annika
Sorenstam is still going strong.</LD>
<LD>   Despite another three-putt bogey, Sorenstam continued her
otherwise flawless play Friday with a two-under-par 70 that gave her
a one-stroke lead in the ADT Championship at West Palm Beach, Fla.,
putting her in good position to win her 11th title of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Sorenstam was at seven-under 137 and was surprised to be one
stroke ahead of Rachel Teske (66), Lorie Kane (69) and Meg Mallon
(71).</LD>
<TE>   "I felt like I left so many putts out there that I was going to be
behind," she said. "I guess the others are leaving some there as
well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods lost more ground in the Dunlop Phoenix at Miyazaki,
Japan, shooting a three-under 68 to fall eight strokes behind
second-round leader Kaname Yokoo. Woods, at three-under 139, holed a
40-foot eagle chip on the par-five fourth hole, but had only one
birdie.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charles Howell III took full advantage of the decision to re-start
the first round of the Australian Open, shooting a five-under 65 to
take a one-stroke lead at Melbourne. Howell was 10 over after 14
holes Thursday when organizers called off play because the Victoria
Gold Club's dry greens were too fast to putt. The tournament was
shortened to 54 holes.</TE>

<TE>   John Huston and Jeff Maggert fired an eight-under 64 under the

<HD>Track Confirms 1999 Fraud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Autotote employee at Delaware Park was fired from his job in 1999
after counterfeiting a winning mutuel ticket, a track official
confirmed Friday night. The incident was not unlike a yearlong scheme
carried out more recently by Chris Harn, who was fired in October by
Autotote for his inside role in the $3-million Breeders' Cup pick-six
scam.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Fasy, chief operating officer at Delaware Park, said that the
dismissed employee, whom he would not name, reprinted the serial
number of an uncashed ticket that was almost a year old and cashed it
for $300. Fasy said he was convinced that there was no connection
between the Delaware Park worker and Harn. Fasy said there have been
no subsequent reports of ticket-counterfeiting at the track.</LD>
<TE>   Although the Autotote employee at Delaware, whose scheme was first
reported in the Washington Post, may not have been part of the Harn
ring that trafficked in races at five other Eastern tracks and two in
Illinois, and although the $300 pales in comparison with the millions
that Harn and his companions were playing for, the 1999 firing still
adds to widespread concerns about security breaches at tote companies
that service tracks. An executive of the National Thoroughbred Racing
Assn. told the California Horse Racing Board on Thursday that his
organization has started an investigation, costing at least $3
million, that will examine the Breeders' Cup scandal and other
possible tote irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   Harn, 29, and two other 29-year-old men were charged in the
Breeders' Cup case, and in a New York federal court on Wednesday,
Harn pleaded guilty to single counts of conspiracy to commit fraud
and conspiracy to launder money. In addition to their attempted score
on the Breeders' Cup races at Arlington Park, the Harn group is
believed to have cashed other multiple-race bets worth more than
$100,000 at Belmont Park and Balmoral Park.</TE>
<TE>   Money from outstanding winning tickets -- called "outs" -- is paid
out to bettors if the tickets are produced within a certain time
frame after the race. In some states, bettors have a year to cash.
After the deadline, depending on the state, the money is distributed
to the state, the racetrack, horsemen for purses and racing
benevolent groups.</TE>
<TE>   The fired Autotote employee in Delaware was caught, Fasy said,
because of a surveillance camera and physical observation by the
track's mutuel manager. Fasy didn't know whether the tote company
brought charges, and Autotote representatives couldn't be reached.
The company, which is based in Newark, Del., processes 65% of the
more than $14 billion that's annually bet on horses in the U.S.</TE>

<DH>With Morton twins, Riverside North's title bid is twice as
strong</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It happens once in a while on the football field: An argument with
seemingly no end between two 16-year-olds each trying to get in the
last word.</LD>
<LD>   Some teammates find it funny. Some coaches find it unsettling.</LD>
<LD>   Twin brothers, chipping at each other.</LD>
<TE>   Damon Morton, older than Dion by one minute -- some would say they
even competed coming out of the womb -- implores the quarterback to
throw the ball farther. Dion yells at his brother, the receiver, to
run the right route.</TE>
<TE>   Sibling rivals. Best friends. Just maybe, two-time section
football champions.</TE>
<TE>   With the Morton twins setting the tone, Riverside North began
defense of its Southern Section Division V football title on Friday
with a 32-0 first-round victory over Norco at Riverside College.</TE>
<TE>   North (8-3) got three touchdowns and 120 yards rushing from Josh
Barnett and posted its first shutout of the season, limiting Norco
(5-6) to 146 yards.</TE>
<TE>   And, as usual, the Mortons were in the middle of things.</TE>
<TE>   Damon, the receiver, got things started by throwing, not catching,
a pass that resulted in a 49-yard gain on the first play from
scrimmage. He also caught three passes for 43 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Dion completed nine of 18 passes for 136 yards and a touchdown and
ran for 43 yards in six carries. His 17-yard scramble set up a
32-yard field goal by Zach Romero on the last play of the half to put
North up, 18-0.</TE>
<TE>   Norco Coach Gary Campbell knew what his team was in for against
the Mortons and the Cougars still couldn't stop them.</TE>
<TE>   "You can tell they've played together a lot," he said. "They look
more in sync than the other guys."</TE>
<TE>   Well, at least they're in sync on the football field. "We argue
all the time over video games, sports, grades," Damon said. Added
Dion: "With each other, we don't hold back any feelings."</TE>
<TE>   But there's no argument about the Morton twins' impact on North
football.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Damon was chosen as the state's best sophomore player
by Cal-Hi Sports after he caught 83 passes for nine touchdowns. This
year, Ivy League coaches can make a good case for choosing Dion,
North's catalyst, as the most valuable player in the league.</TE>
<TE>   "When I watch them, I'm like, 'Dang, there's not much room to make
a play,' and then they make it," North defensive tackle Duke De La O
said. "They'll make something out of nothing. To me, it's just an
everyday thing."</TE>
<TE>   The big-play twins are part of a nucleus of juniors -- De La O,
Barnett, nose guard Devin McWilliams and tight end Adam Wright are
the others -- who have been winning games for North ever since they
arrived on campus. They were 10-0 on the freshman team, then 10-4 and
section champions as sophomores on the varsity.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a group of six kids on that team who we knew were
something special, and Damon and Dion were the two that everyone knew
about," said first-year Coach Steve Hagerty, who spent the previous
two seasons as the Huskies' offensive coordinator. "We all shook our
heads in disbelief last year, but Dion and Damon aren't sneaking up
on anyone anymore."</TE>
<TE>   As defenses focus on Damon and Dion, the offense has become more
diversified. Last season, 74.1% of Dion's completed passes were to
Damon. That's down to about 39% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Opposing defenses rarely offer more competition than the twins get
from each other, a rivalry that was encouraged by their older
brother, Donovan, 25, a former high school quarterback who later
became a football coach and is now a game official.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a natural competition against each other," Donovan said.
"I would always put them against each other anytime we were outside
playing."</TE>
<TE>   Competing against each other, Donovan said, helped the twins
develop skills, whether it was in the classroom or on athletic fields
-- both are on the varsity basketball and track teams as well as
football.</TE>
<TE>   The boys and their mother, LaVerne, and grandmother, Sebastian
Melonson, live in cramped quarters in a Riverside home where Dion and
Damon sleep in a bunk bed, fight over PlayStation and vie for
LaVerne's attention.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a constant balancing act," LaVerne said. "I always have to
be careful to keep everything even."</TE>
<TE>   The boys' father, Maurice, often can be found on the sidelines
during games, helping mark the spot of the ball as part of the
volunteer chain crew.</TE>
<TE>   Damon is the more outgoing of the twins and is willing to show his
flamboyant side on the field. Dion is reserved and serious, acting
more like a coach in the huddle. A natural leader, he was voted team
captain when only a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Damon is considered the better college prospect because, at 5 feet
11, 175 pounds, he is more physically mature. Not only is he
averaging about 17 yards a reception, he has four interceptions and
three fumble recoveries at defensive back, is averaging 14.3 yards on
punt returns and 24.5 yards on kickoff returns.</TE>
<TE>   Dion, 5-8, 160, is also capable of starring on defense. "But he's
our best quarterback," Hagerty said, "and he doesn't get to shine
because he's not on the field as much as his brother. He could
probably handle it, but we're just petrified at the thought of him
being in there and getting hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Next year, though, the coach is already committed to loosening up
a little. Hagerty told Dion he can play some cornerback -- if only to
make an impression on college recruiters who won't be interested in a
short quarterback. "We're going to have to get over our insecurities
and let him do what he's capable of doing," Hagerty said.</TE>
<TE>   Dion, who had not played quarterback until high school, came into
Friday's game averaging 16.8 yards a completion and 5.6 yards a
carry.</TE>
<TE>   Damon credits Dion with helping him over the jitters in his first
varsity game last year against Moreno Valley Rancho Verde. "I was
scared, a little nervous, and I saw my brother play with ease," Damon
said. "He made me more comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   North fell behind by two touchdowns in that game, then scored 20
points in the second quarter and went on to win, 30-20.</TE>
<TE>   "They hit a couple of long passes and made some pretty athletic
plays and we thought, 'You know, this might be OK,' " Hagerty said.</TE>
<TE>   Can't argue that.</TE>

<LD>Chris Hurtado rushed for 141 yards and a touchdown in 11 carries and
Jody Adewale rushed for 70 yards and a score for fifth-seeded L.A.
Roosevelt during a 14-11 victory over 12th-seeded San Pedro in a City
Championship first-round playoff game that was completed Friday after
a power outage on Thursday forced suspension of play.</LD>
<LD>   Hurtado broke loose for several long gains, the longest of which
was a 49-yard scoring run that gave the host Rough Riders (10-1) a
7-3 lead with 2:36 to go in the third quarter.</LD>
<LD>   San Pedro (8-3) pulled to within the final margin on a 31-yard
scoring reception by John Whitt and a two-point conversion run with
nine minutes to play.</LD>
<TE>   The Pirates drove 50 yards in 10 plays on their final possession
to the Roosevelt nine-yard line. With 25 seconds left, quarterback
Steve Taylor scrambled eight yards on a broken play to the one-yard
line but fumbled when he was tackled.</TE>

<LD>Canna Furuta, Yuka Otaka and Ramya Sreepathi each picked up singles
victories for Granada Hills and the top-seeded Highlanders defeated
third-seeded and two-time defending champion Carson, 4-3, to claim
the City Section girls' tennis championship Friday at Balboa Sports
Complex in Encino.</LD>
<LD>   The victory gave the Highlanders (16-0) their second title in
girls' tennis and ended a 48-match winning streak by Carson (15-1),
which was undefeated in winning the 2001 and 2000 titles. Granada
Hills handed the Colts their last loss, 4-3, in the 1999
championship.</LD>
<LD>   Granada Hills won one of three doubles matches to clinch the
victory. The Highlanders' dominance in singles was not unexpected,
thanks to some lineup changes by Carson.</LD>
<TE>   The Colts had their usual No. 2 singles player, defending City
individual champion Judith De Vera, at No. 1 doubles and their No. 3
singles player, Genelyn Ramos, at No. 3 doubles in an effort to
offset Granada Hills' doubles depth.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos teamed with Sheila Pacleb in hopes that the Colts could
sweep doubles and rely on Dianne Matias to win her No. 1 singles
match.</TE>
<TE>   While Matias did her part by rallying to defeat Christine Dao,
4-6, 6-2, 6-2, Carson's third doubles team fell short against Randi
Levine and Alexandra Margolin, 6-0, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   "That was going to be our fourth point, we hoped," Carson Coach
Gordon Emi said. "I was surprised at how good [Granada Hills'] No. 3
doubles team was."</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, there were few surprises.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the four finals between Granada Hills and Carson have been
decided by 4-3 scores. Granada Hills was making its fifth consecutive
appearance in a final. The Highlanders lost in 1998 to Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very nervous," said Otaka, the Highlanders' No. 3 singles
player. "We really wanted it bad. We worked toward this together and
we did it."</TE>
<TE>   In the City Invitational final, Monica Lee defeated Zenina Rashed,
6-1, 5-7, 6-1, at No. 2 singles to lift Eagle Rock to a 4-3 victory
over Woodland Hills Taft.</TE>
<TE>   Eagle Rock (10-5) won all three doubles matches. Taft (7-8), which
lost all 13 matches last season, won three of four singles matches.</TE>

<HD>Esperanza Gets a Meek Victory, 41-7</HD>
<DH>Aztecs rout Santa Margarita in Division I playoffs to keep
their retiring coach on the sidelines another week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Save the retirement roast, the teary-eyed goodbyes, the final
farewells.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Meek will coach at least one more game. His players at
Anaheim Esperanza made sure of that, overcoming a sleepy first half
to thump Santa Margarita, 41-7, in the first round of the Southern
Section Division I football playoffs Friday at Placentia Valencia
High.</LD>
<LD>   Shaun Wildenstein had a season-high 213 yards in 26 carries and
scored three touchdowns, two in the second half, as Esperanza (10-1)
pounded the short-handed Eagles.</LD>
<TE>   Esperanza gave up only 161 yards against Santa Margarita (6-5),
which played without running back Ashton White, who learned Thursday
that a lingering knee injury had worsened: test results revealed a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in White's right knee.</TE>
<TE>   Meek, who will step down after 27 years of coaching but will
become the school's athletic director, isn't quite ready for that
sappy farewell stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't put a fork in me yet," he said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Esperanza held Santa Margarita's offense to 57 yards rushing and
104 yards passing. The Eagles tried, unsuccessfully, to dink-and-dunk
down the field. Case in point: Receiver Bobby Whitmore had 10 catches
... for 34 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita quarterbacks Case Colaw and Mark Sanchez completed
a combined 12 of 25 passes for 87 yards and had three intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   "Even with Ashton, this would have been a tough game," Santa
Margarita Coach Jim Hartigan said.</TE>
<TE>   White initially hurt his knee during a summer passing-league game,
and sat out two regular-season games. He re-aggravated the injury in
the regular-season finale last Friday against Bishop Amat, and was
held out against Esperanza after receiving the results of an MRI test
done earlier in the week.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought it was a strain," said White, who had 1,000 yards
rushing this season and is considering Washington, USC and Colorado
State.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating. I couldn't believe it."</TE>
<TE>   It was hard to believe that Santa Margarita hung with Esperanza in
the first half. The Eagles cut the deficit to 14-7 on a double-pass
play that concluded with Whitmore throwing a 17-yard touchdown to
Mark Johnson with 4:35 left in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But Esperanza forced three turnovers in the second half and scored
on Tom Storing's 26-yard interception return to take a 24-7 lead with
2:38 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Wildenstein and Michael Kirschner, who had 65 yards in 14 carries,
took turns carving up the Eagles in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The Aztecs, trying for their first Southern Section championship
since 1992, will play Santa Ana Mater Dei in a quarterfinal.</TE>

<LD>This is going to sound silly, talking about defense in a
double-overtime shootout in which the teams combined for 77 points.</LD>
<LD>   But two big plays by La Puente Bishop Amat High defensive back
Andrew Gamez keyed the Lancers' 42-35 victory over Redlands on Friday
night at the University of Redlands in a Southern Section Division I
first-round playoff game.</LD>
<LD>   Gamez stopped Redlands fullback Rocky McBroom for a two-yard loss
in the second overtime, then wrapped up quarterback Brandon D'Amico
two plays later and watched his pass fall incomplete on fourth down
as Bishop Amat escaped with the victory.</LD>
<TE>   The Lancers (6-5) will play host to second-seeded Los Alamitos
(10-0-1) on Friday in a quarterfinal game.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Amat running back Andrew Soto scored his fourth touchdown
of the game on a one-yard run in the second overtime to give the
Lancers the decisive score. Kicker Jamal Mitwasi converted his sixth
extra-point attempt of the game to set the final margin.</TE>
<TE>   Soto finished with 152 yards in 26 carries and was one of three
Bishop Amat rushers to gain more than 100 yards as the Lancers piled
up 384 yards rushing. Chris Seals gained 137 yards in 25 carries and
Jonathan Robinson had 101 yards and two touchdowns in 17 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Redlands (7-4), which rode the passing of D'Amico (258 yards, two
touchdowns), converted a fourth and nine at the Bishop Amat 24-yard
line in the second overtime when D'Amico connected with Michael
Franco for a 10-yard gain. But the Terriers could not gain another
first down after Gamez's big plays.</TE>
<TE>   The game was delayed 15 minutes in the second overtime as
physicians attended to Bishop Amat linebacker Moe Vazquez. Coach Mike
DiFiori said the junior suffered a sprained back and should be OK. He
was taken to a hospital as a precaution.</TE>
<TE>   Zach James finished with 120 yards rushing in 18 carries for
Redlands.</TE>
<TE>   -- Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   Ventura St. Bonaventure 35, Arroyo Grande 20 -- Clinging to an
eight-point lead with 1:21 left, the Seraphs turned to Whitney Lewis,
who broke off a 25-yard scoring run to seal the first-round Division
IV victory at Santa Barbara City College.</TE>
<TE>   St. Bonaventure (10-1), the Channel League champion making its
debut in Division IV after winning three consecutive Division XI
titles, knew Arroyo Grande (6-4) would offer a stiff challenge.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles used a punishing rushing attack to rally from a 28-6
halftime deficit. They pulled to within 28-20 with 1:40 left on
freshman quarterback Kyle Pollack's seven-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, St. Bonaventure had been held to eight yards in the
second half, but the Seraphs recovered the onside kick and let Lewis
deliver the victory. He had three touchdowns in the game, including a
two-yard run and 68-yard reception.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Stevens completed nine of 15 passes for 181 yards for St.
Bonaventure.</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo Grande, the fourth-place finisher in the Pac-5 League, had
266 yards rushing.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe Springs St. Paul 23, Palmdale Highland 7 -- The Swordsmen
(7-3-1) relied on their defense as they forced three turnovers and
held Highland (7-4) to 202 yards in a Division III first-round
victory at St. Paul.</TE>
<TE>   St. Paul defensive back Chris Valentino picked up a fumble by
Highland running back Kris Theus and returned it 53 yards for a
touchdown with 17 seconds left in the half to push the lead to 16-7.</TE>
<TE>   The Swordsmen limited Bulldog quarterback Gary Rosales to 12-of-29
passing for 118 yards and intercepted two passes. Theus, who had
1,355 yards rushing entering the game, was limited to 77 yards in 26
carries.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Arcadia 26, Beverly Hills 23 -- Michael Howe turned a short pass
from Brian Ziska into an 83-yard touchdown with 25 seconds left as
the Apaches escaped with a Division III first-round victory at
Arcadia.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills (6-5) had taken its only lead of the game 41 seconds
earlier on Jamie Mahtaban's four-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   Howe rushed for 221 yards in 29 carries and caught two passes for
99 yards and another score for the Apaches (10-1). Ziska completed
six of 14 passes for 197 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a
score.</TE>
<TE>   Ollie Linter completed 14 of 22 passes for 215 yards and one
touchdown and gained a season-high 124 yards on the ground in 10
carries for Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steven Herbert</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Buena 40, Santa Maria Righetti 34 -- Ryan Mole scored two
of his five touchdowns in the final 9:42, but Josh Thomas' 35-yard
pass into the end zone fell incomplete with 35 seconds to play and
Righetti (9-2) could not overcome Buena's 20-point fourth-quarter
advantage in a Division IV first-round game at Ventura High.</TE>
<TE>   Mole, a 5-9 junior who rushed for 187 yards in 17 carries,
returned a kickoff 68 yards for a touchdown and added a three-yard
scoring run to trim the Buena lead to 40-34.</TE>
<TE>   Buena running back Alex Garfio rushed 31 times for 176 yards and
scored on touchdown runs of five, one and 40 yards. Justin Ishida
rushed for 108 yards in three carries, including a 69-yard touchdown
in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas completed 15 of 29 passes for 158 yards but his
fourth-quarter interception was returned 46 yards for a touchdown by
Randy Nava to give Buena (9-2) a 40-20 lead.</TE>
<TE>   -- John Klima</TE>
<TE>   Orange Lutheran 45, Irvine 14 -- Anthony Vernaglia caught three
touchdown passes and returned a fumble 19 yards for a score as the
Lancers won a Division VI first-round game at Brea Olinda.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Lutheran (9-2), which competed in Division XI last season
but won the Empire League title this year, scored 25 unanswered
points in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Vernaglia caught a nine-yard scoring pass from quarterback Seth
Blackamore two minutes into the game. After Pat Roxas scored on a
one-yard run, Vernaglia recovered a fumble by Irvine quarterback
Tyler Dugan that set up his second touchdown reception, this one
covering 20 yards, to make it 19-0.</TE>
<TE>   Blackamore completed 11 of 15 passes for 116 yards and Vernaglia
finished with five catches for 52 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell Vinson, who came in with 1,805 yards rushing, was held to
53 yards in 19 carries for Irvine (6-5).</TE>

<HD>Eisenhower Turns On Heat for Victory</HD>
<DH>Servite leads at halftime but loses its advantage and
finishes with its fourth consecutive defeat, 20-17.</DH>

<LD>Two teams heading in opposite directions met Friday night in the
first round of the Southern Section Division I football playoffs, and
the team on a roll continued rolling.</LD>
<LD>   Using a decisive speed advantage, Rialto Eisenhower scored 10
fourth-quarter points in a 20-17 comeback victory over Anaheim
Servite at Eisenhower.</LD>
<LD>   It was the sixth consecutive victory for Eisenhower (7-4), which
started the season 0-5 on the field, but got one victory back because
of a forfeit. Eisenhower will face Long Beach Poly, a 30-7 winner
over Huntington Beach Edison, in the quarterfinals.</LD>
<TE>   For Servite (7-4), it was the fourth consecutive loss, the last
three coming after having leads at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   A 26-yard field goal by Garrett Palmer with 3 minutes, 8 seconds
to play broke a 17-17 tie and proved the game winner.</TE>
<TE>   Servite drove to midfield, but a pass on fourth down fell
incomplete with 1:07 to play and Eisenhower ran out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrell Browne rushed for 134 yards and a touchdown in 23 carries,
and teammate Anthony Manning had 117 yards and a touchdown in 16
carries. Eisenhower had 171 of its 252 rushing yards in the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   "Speed was a big advantage, but it turned out our big boys outdid
their big boys," Eisenhower Coach Glenn Thompkins said. "This is for
the seniors. They started the season 0-5 ... but now we're in the
second round of the Division I playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Servite led, 14-10, at halftime and took a 17-10 lead when Mike
Lawrence made a 26-yard field goal with 58 seconds left in the third
quarter. Then Browne and Manning got serious.</TE>
<TE>   Manning carried three times for 42 yards on the next Eisenhower
drive, capped by his 15-yard touchdown run that tied the score at
17-17 with 11:17 left.</TE>
<TE>   After the Eisenhower defense held Servite to three and out, Browne
and Manning split 12 consecutive carries including a 17-yard jaunt by
Manning on fourth and two from the Servite 45. Five plays later,
Palmer kicked the game-winning field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't contain their speed inside or out," Servite Coach
Larry Toner said. "They got around the corner, broke it up the middle
and were getting 20 to 30 yards a crack."</TE>
<TE>   Servite seemed to have momentum entering halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower had taken a 10-7 lead on a 48-yard field goal by
Palmer. Servite's Justin Coates fumbled the ensuing kickoff and Myles
Mason recovered for Eisenhower at the Servite 24.</TE>
<TE>   Three plays later, however, Gene Grant intercepted a Gimel
Brownlee pass in the end zone. Servite then drove 80 yards in nine
plays, a scoring drive highlighted by a 40-yard completion from
Coffelt to Matt Slater and capped with a two-yard touchdown run by
Mike Hernishin for a 14-7 Servite lead.</TE>

<HD>Bishop Montgomery Is Good Enough</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul McLeod; Steve Galluzzo</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Both sides agreed there were too many errors to go around Friday
night at Cypress College.</LD>
<LD>   But if Southern Section girls' volleyball championships only have
to be won, not necessarily played to perfection, then credit Torrance
Bishop Montgomery for rallying from a two-games-to-none deficit for a
five-game victory over North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake in the
Southern Section Division III-A title game.</LD>
<LD>   The 13-15, 10-15, 15-3, 15-12, 15-11 victory was the sixth section
title for Bishop Montgomery (24-8) in the last nine years.
Harvard-Westlake (24-5), making its seventh finals appearance in an
eight-year span, had beaten Bishop Montgomery each of the last two
seasons for the crown.</LD>
<TE>   Outside hitter Jamie Crawford had three kills and served for a
couple of points late in the rally-scoring fifth game to help the
Knights win a title for the first time since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not our best game," Bishop Montgomery Coach Kim Willeman
said. "We can be better. We have more building and improvements to
do."</TE>
<TE>   The fifth game started with the teams trading service errors.
Match point came suddenly when a block that was dropping out of
bounds off the hands of Knight middle blocker Noelle Quinn was
inadvertently touched by one of the Wolverines.</TE>
<TE>   Time and time again, Bishop Montgomery gave up points on unforced
errors in the first two games. But the Knights came out blasting in
the third and Harvard-Westlake got rattled.</TE>
<TE>   "Our passing got away from us in that game," Wolverine Coach Jess
Quiroz said.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Marymount d. Flintridge Sacred Heart, 15-11, 10-15, 15-5,
15-13 -- It didn't go quite as expected in the Division IV-AA final
at Cypress College, but Marymount regrouped after Sacred Heart
knotted the match at one-game apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Marymount buried the Tologs in the third game and then held on to
win the fourth for its second section title in the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   -- Paul McLeod</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys d. Woodland Hills Taft, 15-12, 15-8, 15-9 -- They might
have been the defending champion but Van Nuys still felt it had
something to prove in the City Championship final on Friday night at
Occidental College. And the top-seeded Wolves played that way in
sweeping the previously undefeated Toreadors.</TE>
<TE>   After needing five games to win in both the semifinals and finals
a year ago, Van Nuys (18-1) did not lose a game in four playoff
matches.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly don't think it was easier this year because everyone
was out to get us," said senior outside hitter Hala Hadawar, who lead
Van Nuys with 10 kills and five aces. "It was actually more of a
challenge. But this team is more experienced, we play as a team and
we are all really close. Me and my sister are so happy to win it
together."</TE>
<TE>   Junior setter Hana Hadawar had 32 assists and three aces. The
Wolves served 18 aces to Taft's nine.</TE>
<TE>   Tara Teslaa had eight kills and Brooke Troung added five. Troung
served eight consecutive points to give Van Nuys a commanding 12-4
lead in game three.</TE>
<TE>   Second-seeded Taft (15-1) took a 10-6 lead in the first game, but
Van Nuys responded with a 5-0 run and eventually won the game on a
Hala Hadawar block. Troung blocked Taft outside hitter Ann Kukhta to
end the second game.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always been good at coming back," said senior outside
hitter Taylor Burras, who led the Toreadors with 10 kills and five
aces. "We lost the first game to Sylmar in the [semifinals] too.</TE>
<TE>   "We play our best when our backs are against the wall. I don't
know if it was the pressure of the moment or what, but tonight our
skills seemed to break down after that first game."</TE>
<TE>   Middle blocker Danielle Fernandes added six blocks and five kills
for Taft.</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys' only defeat was in a nonleague match against Sherman
Oaks Notre Dame, a Southern Section school.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Roosevelt d. Cudahy Elizabeth, 15-7, 6-15, 15-4, 15-5 --
Paola Zamudio had 30 kills and Edylyn Ortiz added 12 as the Rough
Riders (14-5) won their sixth lower-division title with the City
Invitational victory. It was their first title since 1986.</TE>

1/16 miles on the turf, is the first leg of the Churchill Downs
simulcast network pick three.</TE>

fifth from Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Scott Schwartz. The trainer got off to a five-for-18
start at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Adalberto Lopez and Macario Rodriguez. They are a
combined 5 for 93 at Golden Gate Fields.</TE>

<LD>Portland Trail Blazer teammates Damon Stoudamire and Rasheed Wallace
were cited for misdemeanor marijuana possession early Friday after
their vehicle was stopped on the way home from a game in Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   The players were passengers in the vehicle, which was stopped for
speeding just after midnight near Centralia, Wash., midway between
Seattle and Portland. The Trail Blazers defeated the SuperSonics,
89-85, Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   "It's crazy," Wallace said in a hastily called news conference
with Stoudamire Friday afternoon. "All I've got to say about it is,
the truth will come to the light."</LD>
<TE>   Stoudamire, Wallace and the driver, identified as 43-year-old
Edward Smith of Portland, were cited and released.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, I just want to say we are talking about this today
because me and Rasheed don't want this to become a distraction to our
teammates," Stoudamire said in his brief statement. "We're very sorry
that this happened. We would like to apologize to everyone out
there."</TE>

<LD>The tentative trade to send Larry Walker from the Colorado Rockies to
the Arizona Diamondbacks for Matt Williams and three others fell
through Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The teams ceased talks after Williams vetoed the trade to remain
with his family and the Diamondbacks failed to reach a financial
agreement with Walker.</LD>
<LD>   "Being there for my kids is everything in my life," Williams said.
"This responsibility outweighs anything in my baseball career. I must
and will be with my kids."</LD>
<TE>   Walker and Williams had to approve the deal because both have
no-trade clauses.</TE>
<TE>   Williams turned down the trade because he has full custody of his
three children, who are 10, 11 and 12.</TE>
<TE>   Walker balked at the Diamondbacks' request that he defer a portion
of the $25 million he is due for 2004 and 2005.</TE>

<LD>On the day Emmitt Smith broke the NFL rushing record, San Diego
defensive end Marcellus Wiley was breaking new ground for CBS.</LD>
<LD>   The Chargers were off that Sunday, and Wiley, whose vibrant
personality and skill as a player have made him a media magnet, was
in New York as a guest analyst on "The NFL Today." The show is shot
on an outdoor set on Fifth Avenue that's fashioned to look like part
of a football field.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of quietly mulling what he wanted to say, or nervously
waiting for the red light to pop on, Wiley used the commercial breaks
to work the live audience into a lather. He urged cheers by throwing
his arms into the air, just as he might at Qualcomm Stadium. He did
his "Bucking the Bolt" sack dance. Frankly, he put all other guest
hosts to shame.</LD>
<TE>   "Marcellus is the first guy we've ever had that got the crowd
involved," said Eric Mann, the show's senior producer. "He also had
his full name stitched into the cuff of his sleeve, and gold buttons
on his suit with MW on them. He's the first guy I've ever seen whose
clothes put Deion Sanders in his place."</TE>
<TE>   It isn't just his sartorial splendor that makes Wiley the most
likely NFL player to wind up in America's living room. He has emerged
as a high-profile fixture on a San Diego defense that already has Pro
Bowl players Junior Seau and Rodney Harrison.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the No. 1 guy that the media requests," Bill Johnston,
Charger director of public relations said of Wiley. "Even if the
story isn't about Marcellus, people want to talk to him. They all
want to hear what he has to say."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say Wiley is all talk. He has made two huge plays in
the last two weeks, one in a loss and the other in a victory. Two
weeks ago, he forced Marshall Faulk to fumble near the goal line,
just as the St. Louis running back was about to score. Last Sunday,
Wiley tackled San Francisco quarterback Jeff Garcia for a five-yard
loss in overtime, meaning 49er kicker Jose Cortez had an even longer
field goal attempt two plays later -- a kick Cortez missed. The
Chargers lost to the Rams and beat the 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   Wiley, who went to Columbia, is one of the few Ivy League players
to make an impact in the pros. He was a second-round pick by Buffalo
in 1997 and spent his first four seasons with the Bills. He went to
San Diego last season and made the Pro Bowl with 13 sacks and five
forced fumbles. He missed the better part of three games this season
because of a groin injury and is well off his 2001 pace with four
sacks and one forced fumble, but he still commands the respect of
offensive linemen.</TE>
<TE>   "He learned a lot when he played with Bruce [Smith]," said Miami
offensive lineman Mark Dixon, whose team will play host to the
Chargers on Sunday. "He mimics [Smith's] game a lot. Speed.
Quickness. He's the total package. Coming off an injury, he looks
like his game is back."</TE>
<TE>   Off the field, Wiley's game never left. Like the glossy black
Hummer he drives, he's capable of covering all terrains. A sampling
of a recent conversation:</TE>
<TE>   * On attending an Ivy League school: "Kids will say, 'Man, you're
smart. You went to Columbia.' I say, 'No, all I did is stay in the
house one more cartoon.' Maybe somebody else went out to play, and
I'd say, 'I'm going to study 30 more minutes, then I'm going outside
to play.' I didn't miss anything, and I finally got used to that."</TE>
<TE>   * On the influence of his parents, both postal employees in Los
Angeles: "All my character comes from my mom, and all my objectives
and principles in life come from my dad. He's kind of like my
outline, and she colors me in."</TE>
<TE>   * On collecting throwback football jerseys, a staple of his
wardrobe: "I have a Johnny Unitas one, an all-white one. Oh, man,
that's crucial. That's big time. That's when you're at the party. I
want to wear that at a black-tie function, a place where athletes are
exceptions, and I'll walk in with that. Oh, my goodness. With a white
headband on? People wouldn't even talk to me; it would kill them."</TE>
<TE>   * On a potential stumbling block to a TV career: "I'm not a
football historian. I draw a blank when you go prior to 1996. I'm
like, 'Uh, who?' I always thought that was going to hold me back.
People have always said I have the personality or I can articulate
well enough to do it. But when people say, 'Oh, I see a comparison
between Jeremy Shockey and Mark Bavaro,' and I'll say, 'Mark Bavaro?
Who's Mark Bavaro?' "</TE>
<TE>   * On the anonymity of playing at Columbia: "If we were on TV, we
were on ESPN3 with our game score running across that ticker across
the bottom of the screen."</TE>
<TE>   Rest assured, Wiley will never be trapped in the ticker again.</TE>
<TE>   Around the League</TE>
<TE>   AFC EAST -- Miami players won't soon forget playing the Ravens and
getting an earful from Baltimore Coach Brian Billick, who was talking
some trash during the game. "We had a little jawing on the
sidelines," Miami's Sam Madison told reporters. "Billick asked me,
'Sam, y'all are winning this game, but how does it feel not to have a
[Super Bowl] ring? You want to see my ring?' That just goes to show
you the type of program they have. Without Ray Lewis, they wouldn't
be diddly-poo." Dolphin players said Baltimore assistant coach Bennie
Thompson did some barking too. Said Miami's Jason Taylor, "The
coaches need to quit talking and let the players play the game." ...
Through 10 games last season, Buffalo was 1-9. This season, the Bills
are 5-5. That represents the league's biggest improvement so far. The
biggest drop-off is that of 2-8 Chicago. The Bears were 8-2 at this
point last season.</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH -- When Pittsburgh's Tommy Maddox lay motionless on the
turf last Sunday, it rekindled some disturbing memories for Terance
Mathis, a Steeler receiver. Mathis played for the Jets when teammate
Dennis Byrd was paralyzed in a game. "It's the same reaction all over
again," Mathis said. "When the gurney comes out, the EMS truck comes
out, it's a scary, scary feeling, a scary thought."</TE>
<TE>   The Browns are heading back to New Orleans, where in 1999 they
logged their first victory as an expansion team. That game ended on a
56-yard Hail Mary pass from Tim Couch to Kevin Johnson, sealing a
21-16 victory and bringing then-Saint coach Mike Ditka to his knees,
and beyond. "Anytime anyone asks who was the first team I beat as a
starting QB, I'll always remember that," Couch said. "I can remember
Mike Ditka lying on the carpet and seeing him when I was running down
the sideline. That was probably the best part of it all." Meanwhile,
Johnson was nearly squashed in the celebration. "To be honest, I
couldn't breathe at the bottom of the pile," he said. "You see guys
on the bottom of those piles, it's not a pretty sight."</TE>
<TE>   Not pretty? How's this: Cleveland rookie William Green frequently
throws up before, during and after games. The Browns have gotten used
to it and know the ground rules. Said Coach Butch Davis: "Just don't
stand close to him." Noted.</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH -- All of a sudden, the NFL's most accurate kicker isn't
so accurate. Indianapolis' Mike Vanderjagt has missed five of his
last eight field-goal attempts, including a 23-yarder against Dallas,
the shortest miss of his career. His teammates are unfazed -- "We're
not going to start going for it on fourth down," Peyton Manning said
-- but the mini-slump is troubling to Vanderjagt. "I'm 100% healthy,"
he told reporters this week. "It's not as if I'm a bad kicker. I'm
just not getting it done right now. I have no answer as to why it's
happening or what I'm doing differently."</TE>
<TE>   History repeats? That's the hope of the Titans, who started 1-4
and since have won five in a row. During the club's 1993 season in
Houston, the then-Oilers started 1-4, then won 11 straight to clinch
the division title.</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST -- Responding to his team's 0-3 record in night games,
Denver Coach Mike Shanahan conducted Friday's practice in the evening
under the lights at Invesco Field. "Sometimes you do some things when
things aren't going right to change the mind-set," Shanahan said.
"Normally we practice about 48 hours, somewhere in that area, before
we play a game. Since we haven't been successful in the three later
games and practiced a little bit earlier, we're going to try and keep
that [time frame]." By the way, the Broncos are 7-0 in day games.</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST -- Were the Cowboys to keep him under his current
contract, Emmitt Smith would count $9.8 million against the salary
cap next season. They'll either tear up that deal, or, more likely,
bid him adieu. Smith will be 34 next season, and Troy Hambrick
already is taking a serious bite out of his playing time. That said,
Cowboy owner Jerry Jones hinted to reporters this week that Smith
could stick around. "It's been my experience, just as sure as you
start thinking, 'No way,' or got logic figured it will go a certain
way, it doesn't," Jones said. "Emmitt Smith is still very productive,
and we need him to win games and we'll make a decision when the
season ends. But, no, I don't know you can say this is the beginning
of the end." Oh, go ahead and say it. Smith's gone.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia tight end Chad Lewis is way down on catches this
season and suffered a rather embarrassing injury against Arizona last
week, a lacerated backside. He left the game and had to be stitched
up before returning. Now, he has been carrying around an inflatable
pillow to sit on, a device his teammates have taken to calling his
"booty tube." Eagle Coach Andy Reid doesn't like his players to
discuss their injuries with reporters, instead opting to handle those
questions himself. Lewis abides by the rules, so when he was asked
this week about his tender area, he said: "If you want to know
anything about my butt, you're going to have to ask Andy." Doubly
noted.</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH -- Their season has been reduced to tatters, but all is
not lost for the Vikings. They have the league's top-ranked ground
attack, led by second-year running back Michael Bennett, who's
looking more and more like Robert Smith. Bennett is the first player
in league history with runs of 60 yards or longer in three
consecutive weeks.... Joey Harrington is still working out the kinks.
The Lions haven't scored more than two touchdowns in the last five
games.</TE>
<TE>   More evidence Brett Favre is feistier than your typical
quarterback: He was penalized 15 yards last Sunday for tackling
Viking safety Jack Brewer three steps out of bounds. It wasn't
Favre's first such transgression against Minnesota. In a 1992 game at
the Metrodome, he was flagged for an illegal hit when he took out
defensive end Roy Barker at the knees on an interception return. And,
in 1999, he was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct when he gave
the throat-slash gesture to Detroit nickel back Robert Bailey.... In
their four-game losing streak at Tampa, the Packers have averaged 71
yards rushing a game and have zero rushing touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH -- Penalties are becoming a big problem for the Saints,
who have 88, ranking them second behind Minnesota with 91. New
Orleans players were flagged a season-high 16 times for 133 yards in
a loss to Atlanta last week. Twice, they were called for roughing
Falcon quarterback Michael Vick on third down. Saint Coach Jim
Haslett called Supervisor of Officials Jim Daopoulos on Monday,
seeking clarification on those personal fouls, but didn't glean much
from the conversation. "I'm not really sure what roughing the
quarterback is," Haslett told reporters. "There are a number of
different explanations.... Our quarterback got hit twice the same way
and got clipped at the knees one time, and we did not get any calls.
I don't think there's a clear understanding throughout the league on
exactly what the call is."</TE>
<TE>   In his first four years as a head coach, Jon Gruden directed
Oakland teams that routinely dropped off in the second half of
seasons. Those Raiders were 23-9 in the first eight games, 15-17 in
the last eight. His teams finished 8-8, 8-8, 12-4 and 10-6. Gruden,
whose Buccaneers are 8-2, doesn't worry much about the Raider trend.
"We're counting on finishing strong," he said. "Hell, we're not
counting on anyone disappearing, crumbling up and blowing away. There
has been some talk that I'm a crumbler, that I fade down the stretch,
but that's just idle chatter."</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST -- The 49ers have been outscored in the fourth quarter,
77-48. "We need to get away from the mentality of working the clock
and keeping their offense off the field," quarterback Jeff Garcia
said. "We're losing our killer instinct to continue to get after it."
OK, Terrell Owens has said and done a lot of dumb things over the
past few years, but it's worth noting he took some heat for saying
the 49ers lacked killer instinct. When Garcia says it, no one
flinches.</TE>
<TE>   Since the merger, only two NFL teams have started 0-5, then won
their next five to even their records -- last season's Redskins and
this season's Rams.... Marc Bulger had 1,496 yards passing, more than
any other NFL quarterback in his first five games. Even that couldn't
keep him in the Ram lineup.</TE>

2     DENVER  (7-3)         Brian Griese to Steve Beuerlein shouldn't
                            be a drastic drop-off. (5)
3     GREEN BAY  (8-2)      Can clinch the NFC North with a win, and
                            a Minnesota loss or tie. (1)
4     SAN DIEGO (7-3)       Junior Seau is starting to get back into
                            the flow. (6)
5     SAN FRANCISCO  (7-3)  49ers need someone who can nail clutch

7     OAKLAND (6-4)         Rich Gannon is getting plenty of
                            protection from his line. (12)
8     ST. LOUIS (5-5)       Kurt Warner is back, but he has to be
                            looking over his shoulder. (11)
9     ATLANTA  (6-3-1)      Not only is he exciting, Michael Vick
                            doesn't make big mistakes. (10)
10    MIAMI (6-4)           Suddenly accurate, Ray Lucas seemed a
                            changed man against Ravens. (15)
11    NEW ENGLAND  (5-5)    Offense didn't score a touchdown against

14    PITTSBURGH  (5-4-1)   Tommy Maddox can't get back quickly
                            enough for Steelers. (7)
15    KANSAS CITY  (5-5)    Priest Holmes has run for touchdown in
                            eight consecutive games. (14)
16    INDIANAPOLIS  (6-4)   End Dwight Freeney is a potential
                            defensive rookie of the year. (17)
17    BUFFALO (5-5)         Penalties are becoming a problem for the
                            Bills. (13)
18    N.Y. GIANTS  (6-4)    If he has something left, Herman Moore
                            will be a big help. (19)
19    N.Y. JETS  (5-5)      Chad Pennington leads the NFL with a 71%
                            completion mark. (18)
20    JACKSONVILLE  (5-5)   Jaguars almost blew a 17-point lead to an
                            expansion franchise. (21)
21    CLEVELAND  (5-5)      The running game was rolling ... against
                            the Bengals. (23)
22    BALTIMORE  (4-6)      Ray Lewis might be back, but the rest of
                            the defense isn't. (20)
23    WASHINGTON  (4-6)     Bruce Smith has sacked 70 quarterbacks --
                            but never Kurt Warner. (22)
24    MINNESOTA (3-7)       Michael Bennett is a beacon in an
                            otherwise dismal season. (30)
25    ARIZONA (4-6)         Cardinals have played AFC West teams
                            tough lately. (24)
26    SEATTLE (3-7)         Going up against Chief defense that has
                            given up 43 points in last three games.
                            (25)
27    DETROIT (3-7)         Joey Harrington is the QB answer, but
                            Lion fans have to give him time. (26)
28    CAROLINA  (3-7)       Julius Peppers is first Panther defensive
                            lineman with double-digit sacks. (27)
29    DALLAS  (3-7)         Troy Hambrick is ready to push aside
                            Emmitt Smith. (28)
30    CHICAGO (2-8)         How did the Bears get so brutally bad so
                            quickly? (29)
31    HOUSTON (2-8)         David Carr is giving fans a glimpse of
                            his potential. (32)
32    CINCINNATI  (1-9)     Just counting the days until the 2003

<HD>Panthers' Smith Charged With Assault</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carolina Panther wide receiver Steve Smith was jailed and charged
with misdemeanor assault Friday after attacking a teammate earlier
this week.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony Bright, a practice-squad player, had a broken nose and was
hospitalized for two nights after the fight, which occurred during a
film session Monday. Bright filed a report with the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg police after his release from the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The Panthers already suspended Smith for Sunday's home game
against Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Smith was charged with assault inflicting serious injury, Police
Capt. Cam Selvey said. As a misdemeanor, the charge carries a maximum
sentence of 120 days imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   Smith turned himself in to sheriff's deputies around 5 p.m. He was
released Friday night after posting $2,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a turbulent week for the Panthers (3-7), who released
offensive tackle Chris Terry on Wednesday after he was arrested for
failing to appear in court on a misdemeanor charge of assaulting his
wife.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, an All-Pro kick returner as a rookie last season, has
apologized for attacking Bright and has agreed to receive counseling
for his temper.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Garrison Hearst made an emotional apology for using a slur and
saying he wouldn't want a gay player as a teammate with the San
Francisco 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing visibly shaken by the controversy caused by his pointed
remarks to the Fresno Bee three weeks earlier, the 49er Pro Bowl
running back made a short statement at the team's training complex.</TE>
<TE>   "Being an African American, I know that discrimination is wrong,"
Hearst said. "I was wrong for saying what I said about anybody, any
race or any religion. I want to apologize to the San Francisco 49ers
organization, the city of San Francisco for the comments that I made,
and also to my teammates for bringing this distraction upon us."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of gays in football became a topic of national
discussion earlier this season when former NFL defensive lineman
Esera Tuaolo revealed his homosexuality. When Hearst was first asked
whether he would want a gay player as a teammate, he said he
wouldn't, and he twice used a common slur considered derogatory to
gays.</TE>

<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Miami Edison High's postseason hopes ended Friday when a judge
rejected the football team's attempt to get its playoff loss
overturned in court.</LD>
<LD>   Circuit Judge Gerald Hubbart ruled that officials' decisions are
not reviewable by the court, and there is not enough evidence to show
the wrong call was made.</LD>
<LD>   Edison contended that a referee had no reason to stop the clock
with two seconds remaining against Palm Beach Gardens Dwyer last
weekend after a Dwyer player, frustrated that his team had been
stopped just short of the goal line, pulled off his helmet.</LD>
<TE>   That stoppage gave Dwyer time to kick the game-winning 19-yard
field goal and win 11-10. Dwyer moves on to play its second-round
game against Pompano Beach Ely on Friday night. Edison wanted the
outcome reversed or the fourth quarter replayed.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel the ruling is unfair and unfortunate, but we have to move
on," Edison Coach Corey Bell said.</TE>
<TE>   Dwyer Athletic Director Kevin Sterling said the case has been a
distraction for his players and coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "I have had similar situations that could have gone either way,"
Sterling said. "When it comes to officials' judgment, you can't be
happy with all the calls. But never once when I was a coach did I
even think about taking it to this level."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Cory Paus always had Craig Bragg on his radar screen. Drew Olson and
Matt Moore have had trouble finding the sophomore receiver's
coordinates.</LD>
<LD>   Bragg leads UCLA with 44 catches for 738 yards and eight
touchdowns. But since Olson and Moore replaced the injured Paus at
quarterback, he has only seven catches for 105 yards in three games.</LD>
<LD>   "I know what kind of weapon Craig is," Olson said. "He's a huge
part of the offense. But if the defense takes him away, we go
somewhere else."</LD>
<TE>   Bragg needs five receptions to pass Mike Sherrard (48 in 1983) and
become the UCLA single-season sophomore leader. He also ranks third
in the Pacific 10 Conference with a 12.2 punt-return average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Depth at defensive tackle could be a problem. Rodney Leisle is
expected to sit out his sixth game in a row because of a broken foot
and frequently used freshman C.J. Niusulu is out after undergoing an
emergency appendectomy.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Phillips, a fifth-year senior, will make his first start in
two years. Ryan Boschetti is the only experienced backup for Phillips
and senior Steve Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   A strong effort can be expected from Phillips, whose girlfriend,
Kecia, is a USC graduate student</TE>
<TE>   "We want to give him the opportunity to start," Coach Bob Toledo
said. "He's been here five years and this is a nice, little reward."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paus plans to do more walking today than he has done since
breaking his fibula against California.</TE>
<TE>   The senior quarterback will walk with his teammates from the bus
to the Rose Bowl through the tailgate crowd and take the field for
the coin flip with the other 13 Bruin seniors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all I can do, but I'm going to make the most of it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA senior tackle Bryce Bohlander has been selected to the Pac-10
All-Academic team.... Mike Seidman is a semifinalist for the Mackey
Award as college football's best tight end.... Oklahoma will play
UCLA in Norman, Okla., next season. The Sooners tried to cancel the
game, but UCLA insisted on playing. Oklahoma will play UCLA at the

<HD>Justice Protects and Serves Trojans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A week after neutralizing the national leader in sacks, USC tackle
Winston Justice is looking forward to another major test today when
the seventh-ranked Trojans play 25th-ranked UCLA at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Justice, a 6-foot-6, 305-pound freshman, will go up against Bruin
defensive end Dave Ball, a 6-6, 278-pound junior who ranks fourth in
the Pacific 10 Conference with 10 sacks.</LD>
<LD>   "Keep 'em coming," Justice said. "That's the only way to see if
you're getting better."</LD>
<TE>   Justice handled Arizona State defensive end Terrell Suggs in the
Trojans' 34-13 victory last Saturday. Suggs assisted on one sack but
otherwise was not much of a factor as the Trojans extended their
winning streak to five games.</TE>
<TE>   "Suggs had more speed, Ball has more power," Justice said. "I got
a lot of confidence from last week. I think I can keep it going."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said the Trojans devised several schemes to
handle Suggs. Justice and left tackle Jacob Rogers will not have as
much help today against a Bruin team that has recorded 35 sacks.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to take care of themselves a little more," Carroll
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Davis kicked two 20-yard field goals and three extra points
in last year's 27-0 victory over the Bruins, but the senior struggled
this season against Colorado and Kansas State and has been the backup
to Ryan Killeen since the Pac-10 opener against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy Pola, USC's special teams coach, said he reminded Davis
about David Bell, who stepped in for the injured John Wall and kicked
a 36-yard field goal with nine seconds left to beat the Bruins,
38-35, in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know," Pola said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Marcell Allmond said the Trojan secondary cannot get
lulled into overplaying the run to contain Bruin tailback Tyler
Ebell.</TE>
<TE>   "They also have great receivers," Allmond said. "You still have to
respect the throwing game."</TE>
<TE>   Craig Bragg leads the Bruins with 44 receptions and is averaging
16.8 yards a catch. Tab Perry has 34 receptions and is averaging 20.4
yards a catch. Tight end Mike Seidman also has 34 receptions.</TE>

<LD>NO. 7 USC (8-2, 6-1) at NO. 25 UCLA (7-3, 4-2)</LD>
<LD>   Today, 12:30 p.m., Rose Bowl</LD>
<LD>   TV -- Channel 7</LD>
<TE>   Radio -- KXTA (1150), KMPC (1540), XPRS (1090, Spanish), KPLS
(830)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN UCLA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The immovable object is the Trojan run defense, which has not
allowed an opposing back to rush for 100 yards. The irresistible
force is Bruin tailback Tyler Ebell, who has gained more than 100 in
six consecutive games and should get at least 25 carries today.
Manuel White, fully recovered from a hamstring injury, should provide
sorely needed power running to complement Ebell. UCLA will throw
enough to keep USC from stacking the line of scrimmage. Freshman
quarterbacks Drew Olson and Matt Moore occasionally will strike deep
to Tab Perry or Craig Bragg. Trojan safety Troy Polamalu will do
everything from blitzing the quarterback to covering receivers on
deep routes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN USC HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer will spread the ball among several wide
receivers, backs and tight end Alex Holmes. UCLA has been vulnerable
to power running off tackle, so Justin Fargas will get opportunities
to run inside. Speedster Sultan McCullough will take his shots
outside and fullback Malaefou MacKenzie is a running and receiving
threat. The health of freshman wide receiver Mike Williams is a
question mark. If fully recovered from a hamstring injury, he will be
Palmer's primary target. If not, expect Keary Colbert and Kareem
Kelly to have expanded roles. The Trojans have scored more than 30
points in five consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO USC VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Contain Tyler Ebell: If the Trojans neutralize Ebell, they can
turn up the pressure on quarterbacks Olson and Moore.</TE>
<TE>   2. Establish the run: Fargas must rush the ball as he did last
week against Arizona State. That will allow Palmer and his corps of
receivers to exploit the Bruin secondary with play-action passes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Avoid turnovers and penalties: Palmer has not had a pass
intercepted in the last two games and the Trojans did not commit a
turnover last week against Arizona State. USC is averaging seven
penalties a game.</TE>
<TE>   4. Mistake-free kicking game: In a game as emotionally charged as
this one, the Trojans cannot afford any blocked kicks. Ryan Killeen
must kick the ball into the end zone on kickoffs, convert all
extra-point attempts and make field-goal attempts within his range.
Punter Tom Malone must maintain his average of 42.4 yards per kick
and not allow the Bruins good field position.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO UCLA VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Protect the kids: Olson and Moore must get enough pass
protection to avoid mistakes while staying poised in the rivalry
atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   2. Corral the catchers: Bruin defenders must tackle well to limit
the yards gained by Trojan receivers after they catch short passes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Control field position: The defense and special teams must make
big plays to compensate for a conservative offensive game plan.</TE>
