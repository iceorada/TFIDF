<HD>China Stepping Up War Against Drugs</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: New detection techniques and communication
are stemming the flow of heroin, most coming over southern border.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER BODEEN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>KUNMING, China</DL>
<LD>In class, the students pass around hollow pineapples used to smuggle
drugs, and they practice their frisking techniques on a blond-wigged
mannequin.</LD>
<LD>   This is China's next generation of anti-drug agents, training at a
campus in Yunnan province in the mountainous southwest. It can seem
at times almost lighthearted, but they face a daunting task. China is
awash in heroin and methamphetamine, much of it coming over the
country's southern border.</LD>
<LD>   Reeling from the influx, China has gone from hiding the problem to
making it highly public. Last year, drug enforcers adopted new
high-tech communications, surveillance and detection techniques.
Perhaps most important, they have stepped up cooperation with China's
Southeast Asian neighbors.</LD>
<TE>   Drug officials claim impressive results.</TE>
<TE>   Helped by cooperation with Myanmar, heroin seizures in
southwestern China soared 163% in 2001, to a record 17,855 pounds,
according to Sun Dahong, a senior anti-drug official.</TE>
<TE>   Collaboration has "strongly frightened the drug traffickers at
home and abroad, and effectively checked the trafficking activities,"
Sun said.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1980s and '90s, drug addiction was treated as a
national embarrassment to be kept out of sight, hindering drug
education efforts and cooperation with other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, however, police have issued frank assessments of the
challenge. Bai Jingfu, deputy director of the National Narcotics
Control Commission, warned June 20 that despite successes, the
situation was grim.</TE>
<TE>   After seizing power in the 1949 revolution, China's communists
tackled the drug trade by shooting opium dealers and forcing addicts
to quit cold turkey. But heroin made a roaring comeback in the 1980s
with the opening of China's economy and loosening of social controls.</TE>
<TE>   Official statistics report that the number of known addicts rose
to 860,000 by 2000, from 70,000 at the start of the decade. Experts
say the actual number of regular users probably tops 4 million; most
are under 35.</TE>
<TE>   Although signs of drug use are rarely seen in public, heroin's
effects are showing up in China's galloping rate of AIDS infection,
now estimated at 850,000 people. Most got the disease from sharing
needles or poor sanitation in the blood-selling business.</TE>
<TE>   Smugglers and dealers are routinely shot after brief trials.
Addicts are packed off to labor camps or stark compulsory
detoxification centers, but officials say fewer than 10% stay clean
after release.</TE>
<TE>   From 1990 to 2001, 125,400 pounds of drugs were seized in Yunnan,
said Sun, head of the southwestern province's drug enforcement
bureau. Almost 2,000 tons of chemicals used in the production of
heroin and other drugs were seized, and more than 100,000 suspects
arrested, he said.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, 32 Chinese law enforcement officers were killed
by drug traffickers and 208 were injured, Sun said.</TE>
<TE>   To help stem the flow, Public Security Minister Jia Chunwang made
a series of visits last year to sign China's first cooperative
anti-drug ventures with Thailand, Myanmar and Laos -- the
heroin-producing "Golden Triangle" of Southeast Asia -- and Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese police said information-sharing led to their biggest
heroin bust to date -- 1,500 pounds seized in November in a joint
raid with Myanmar police in Yunnan.</TE>
<TE>   They said cooperation has also led to deportations or killings by
police of key drug suspects, destruction of jungle drug labs in
Myanmar's northern Shan state, and crop substitution programs in
opium-cultivating areas of Myanmar and Laos.</TE>
<TE>   The Yunnan Public Security College's anti-drug school in Kunming
trains police from Myanmar. Sun said he envisions China becoming the
regional enforcement leader. Police invited foreign reporters to tour
the school, where they saw cadets in fatigues drilling with plastic
model guns while others practiced high kicks against pad-wearing
partners in a gym.</TE>
<TE>   Photo displays showed addicts dead of overdoses or ridden with
sores and swollen limbs.</TE>
<TE>   In a drug-identification class, grinning cadets frisked a male
mannequin in a safari suit and found phony drugs stashed in a bag
strapped to the small of its back. The mannequin was dressed in a
blond wig and a safari suit -- China's way of showing that it views
the drug problem as a Western import.</TE>
<TE>   Another room had displays about drug trafficking blamed on
foreigners, dating back to the early 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   One sign lauded Lin Zexu, who launched one of the world's first
drug enforcement efforts in 1839 by ordering the destruction of opium
brought by British merchants into the southern port of Guangzhou.</TE>
<TE>   The incident led to war with Britain, which seized Hong Kong as a
colony.</TE>
<TE>   "Drugs: A century of national humiliation," said the sign.</TE>

<HD>Czechoslovakia Calls Out to Those Exiled</HD>
<DH>History: Ousted after World War II, ethnic Germans want
their property and honor back. But there's little sympathy in Prague.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSANNA LOOF</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>KLEINSCHWEINBARTH, Austria</DL>
<LD>Hildegard Nuss was younger than 10 when she was forced to leave her
home, but she says time hasn't diminished the empty feeling inside
her.</LD>
<LD>   She was among 3 million ethnic Germans who were expelled from what
was then Czechoslovakia. Now, 57 years later, some of those still
alive want their property back and their honor restored, posing an
awkward problem for a continent striving to heal the wounds of World
War II and unite into a borderless Europe.</LD>
<LD>   In 1938, when Hitler seized Czechoslovakia, many in its
German-speaking Sudetenland region welcomed the Nazis as liberators.
Just seven years later, with the Nazis defeated, they were declared
enemies of the Czech and Slovak peoples. They were sent into exile
and their property was confiscated.</LD>
<TE>   Nuss settled in Austria, but she says she has never recovered from
the trauma. "I feel like a tree that has had its roots chopped off,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   She and many other Sudeten Germans are fighting to have the
decrees nullified. The battle has turned fiercer as the Czech
Republic -- which split peacefully from Slovakia in 1993 -- edges
closer to its goal of joining the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   Sudeten Germans and Austria's right-wing Freedom Party say the
Czech Republic should not be allowed into the EU unless it nullifies
the decrees. Otherwise, say exiles such as Johann Ludwig, the
15-nation union would be morally weakened. Ludwig, 78, fears the
issue will be forgotten once the country joins the EU. In fact, EU
officials have already said the issue will not hinder admission of
the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   The rumblings are coming not just from Austria but from Germany,
where most of the Sudeten Germans were resettled. Bavarian Gov.
Edmund Stoiber, the conservative candidate for chancellor in
September elections, has called the decrees "intolerable for the
European Union."</TE>
<TE>   But there seems to be little sympathy for the Sudeten argument
among Czechs, for whom the Sudetenland evokes memories of their
country being dismembered to appease Hitler, then swallowed up by the
Third Reich.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman referred to the
Sudeten Germans of the 1930s as "traitors" and "Hitler's fifth
column," prompting Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to call off a planned
visit to Prague. While EU officials anxiously begged all sides to
bury the past, the Czech Parliament's lower chamber voted unanimously
to keep the banishment decrees in effect.</TE>
<TE>   Czech politicians argue that all compensation issues were settled
after World War II, and that annulling the decrees would expose them
to new and costly restitution claims.</TE>
<TE>   Poland, which expelled about 2.5 million ethnic Germans after the
war, is also facing claims for restitution, but the Sudeten campaign
is the loudest.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should a crime not be atoned for?" asked Gerhard Zeihsel,
president of the Austrian chapter of the Sudetendeutsche
Landsmannschaft, a group fighting for the rights of those expelled.</TE>
<TE>   The exiles have kept in close touch over the years, meeting at
monuments they built to keep the memories alive.</TE>
<TE>   The Austrian chapter meets annually below a cross on a mountain
near the village of Kleinschweinbarth, 45 miles north of Vienna and
just south of the Czech border. The mountain overlooks the hills and
villages that Sudeten Germans once called home.</TE>
<TE>   When Czechoslovakia was communist, some Sudeten Germans had
trouble getting visitors' visas, while others were reluctant to visit
a country that had driven them away. Many would go to lookout points
near the border to gaze at their homeland from afar.</TE>
<TE>   Erhard Frey, expelled when he was 9, looked longingly across the
border at lush fields cradling the land that housed his grandparents'
67-acre farm.</TE>
<TE>   Now 66, Frey lives in Vienna, owns a vegetable cannery and
acknowledges that he has done better in Austria than he would have in
Czechoslovakia.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have never wanted to live in communist Czechoslovakia,"
he said. "But I still want the land back. We want to own the land.
What we will do with it is a separate issue, but we have the right to
own it, or to be refunded."</TE>
<TE>   Even if he was willing to buy the land, he couldn't, because Czech
law forbids selling real estate to foreigners. That law is supposed
to be dropped once the Czechs join the EU, but they are negotiating
to keep it on their books.</TE>

<HD>Fake Diplomas a Lucrative Business in China</HD>
<DH>Fraud: The widespread use of forged credentials has raised
doubts about the qualifications of Chinese students and job
applicants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELEN LUK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHENZHEN, China</DL>
<LD>On a heat-seared thoroughfare outside the five-story Shenzhen Book
City, a dozen men are handing out tiny pink business cards to the
pedestrians streaming past.</LD>
<LD>   A short, slick man in his 20s beats out his swarming rivals to
approach a visitor.</LD>
<LD>   "Can I help you? What documents are you looking for?" asks the
smiling man, who offers a card bearing the name Li Hua, of Southeast
Asia Evidence (Group) Co.</LD>
<TE>   After a bit of haggling, Li agrees to provide one of his products
-- a top pedigree university diploma for 250 yuan, or $32.</TE>
<TE>   The man calling himself Li is one of thousands of touts who haunt
bookstores and university campuses throughout China, seeking
customers eager to embellish their records with fake diplomas and
other documents.</TE>
<TE>   The competition for good jobs has made such counterfeiting a
lucrative business -- and a headache for the government and
universities. It appears to be thriving despite a government
crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   The widespread use of forged credentials has raised doubts in
Western academic and business circles about the qualifications of
Chinese students and job applicants.</TE>
<TE>   It's also an embarrassment for Chinese universities striving for
world-class status.</TE>
<TE>   State-run Chinese news media reported that the national census in
2000 recorded at least 600,000 more college or university graduates
than the actual number of degrees awarded.</TE>
<TE>   Zhou Shaosen, Communist Party secretary at Nanjing University,
told the state-run Xinhua News Agency that a Shenzhen organization
asked for authentication of four different styles of Nanjing
University diplomas. All were fake.</TE>
<TE>   The national government set up six centers around the country in
May 2001 to verify college diplomas. The center in southern Guangdong
province says about 800 of 3,500 certificates checked through last
March proved bogus.</TE>
<TE>   Among the best-known cases was a young farmer from eastern China's
Anhui province who taught philosophy -- poorly -- at a Nanjing
university for six months until he was discovered to have no master's
degree after all.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese media have carried numerous exposes of Communist Party
officials who used counterfeit diplomas to advance their careers.</TE>
<TE>   One was Hu Changqing, a former deputy governor of southeastern
Jiangxi province, who was executed for taking bribes. He had claimed
to hold two degrees -- one in law -- from prestigious Peking
University. He actually had bought phony diplomas near the campus.</TE>
<TE>   In April, police in Shanghai seized 100,000 copies of bogus
licenses and certificates, and detained seven suspects in a bust
authorities described as the biggest of its kind.</TE>
<TE>   After a raid in Beijing, state television showed mounds of red
stamps and computers used to make thousands of fake ID cards,
passports and diplomas.</TE>
<TE>   "All the documents a person needs from birth to death are here," a
police officer told the Beijing Youth Daily.</TE>
<TE>   One attempt to stamp out illegal sales of fake certificates
backfired.</TE>
<TE>   A Web site was set up to register legitimate university diplomas,
but counterfeiters logged on and stole the details of graduates to
use on fake certificates with new photos, the China Youth Daily
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Advances in technology mean you simply can't trust your eyes when
looking at documents, says John Baxter, executive director of Hong
Kong-based Quest Research Ltd., which helps multinational finance and
technology companies carry out background checks on prospective
employees.</TE>
<TE>   "We would never even attempt to say if something is genuine or not
just by looking at it," Baxter said.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody can scan somebody else's degree into the computer; they
can just change the name and print it out. Or they can buy them on
the streets of cities in China."</TE>
<TE>   Out of hundreds of pre-employment screenings Quest Research does
each year, about 5% turn out to include bogus diplomas, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just in China," Baxter added. "It's in India; it's in
every country."</TE>

<HD>Ban Can't Compete With Public's Thirst for Ivory</HD>
<DH>Thailand: Although illegal, trade of the commodity
flourishes because of corruption and lax enforcement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>UAMDAO NOIKORN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PAYUHA KHIRI, Thailand</DL>
<LD>Scrutinizing the logo of the Liverpool soccer team, Amnuay
Chansonthima sees a hefty profit.</LD>
<LD>   Amnuay, 52, is one of Thailand's most skilled ivory carvers. His
ivory belt buckles with logos of British soccer teams are popular,
especially in the wake of the World Cup. Buckles of various materials
with soccer team logos have long been popular among Thais.</LD>
<LD>   Soccer buckles are just a fraction of the work that comes Amnuay's
way. And it's only a blip in the illegal international ivory trade in
which Thailand has emerged as a key culprit.</LD>
<TE>   Save the Elephants, a nongovernmental group based in Nairobi,
Kenya, recently accused Thailand of being Asia's largest buyer of
illegal African ivory, which is carved into Buddha statues, rings,
chopsticks, bangles and other items sold to tourists and businessmen
from Asia, Europe and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam was branded as another major importer of raw African
ivory, but the study excluded China and Japan, which are reported to
be the two largest consumers of processed ivory. Experts say the
extent of the illegal trade in those two countries is difficult to
gauge.</TE>
<TE>   The Nairobi group's study, conducted between November 2000 and
March 2001, found 105,000 ivory items for sale in eight Asian
countries. Of those, 88,000 were spotted in Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   A survey by World Wildlife Fund Thailand during the same period
found that jewelry, trinkets and other items with ivory components
were among the top three sellers in 266 souvenir shops nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Thailand is a signatory of the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species, which banned trade in ivory in 1989 after a
wholesale slaughter of African elephants by poachers in the 1970s and
'80s.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say corruption, legal loopholes, outdated laws and
lack of enforcement allow the smuggling and processing of ivory to
flourish in Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   Thailand allows trade in ivory taken from domesticated elephants
within the country, which are registered as beasts of burden rather
than as wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials deny that illegal ivory is a big problem in
Thailand. Sunggorn Puengpradit, a Customs Department official, says
once-rampant smuggling has been curbed, with just less than 3,000
pounds of ivory, worth $165,000, seized over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   He says that smuggling by diplomats, which also was cited in the
Nairobi report, remains the only channel that has not been blocked.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in Payuha Khiri, 130 miles north of Bangkok, the capital,
carvers seem to enjoy a steady supply of African elephant tusks. The
area has gained a reputation as a home of the finest craftsmanship in
ivory and as a center of the trade.</TE>
<TE>   Protests by conservationists have made traders more careful, but
business does not appear to have slowed. "I have to work every day to
finish orders on time," Amnuay says.</TE>
<TE>   He claims to have no knowledge of how the ivory finds its way to
his workbench, but says 90% of it comes from African elephants.</TE>
<TE>   "Raw ivory without a cavity is worth about 7,000 baht [about $170]
a kilo [2.2 pounds]," Amnuay says as he takes a small piece of still
bloodstained tusk from a drawer.</TE>
<TE>   Ivory from Asian elephants fetches an even higher price because of
its finer texture, warmer tone and rarity.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say that, despite the relatively openness of places like
Payuha Khiri, rooting out illegal ivory is difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "Store owners show us a yellowish, smelly document about an
elephant that died 24 years ago saying all their products are made of
legal ivory," says Thanit Palasuwan, who heads the Forestry
Department's Wildlife Protection Unit.</TE>
<TE>   Thanit says his unit does not have the resources to investigate
the origins of ivory items.</TE>
<TE>   He also says that, regardless of the looks , some carved items are
made not of ivory but of resin or elephant bones.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to halt smuggling at airports and harbors, where the
Customs Department prohibits outside experts or anyone else from
being with its officers during inspections of imported goods. The
rule is meant to prevent collusion between customs officers and
illegal importers. But cases of corruption and bribery surface
continually within virtually every government agency.</TE>
<TE>   Thanit believes that Asians, rather than Westerners, play the
biggest role in despoiling elephant populations. Elephant numbers
have fallen dramatically, although some recent conservation efforts
in Africa have proved successful.</TE>
<TE>   Africa's elephants number about half a million, but the Asian
species in the wild has dwindled to less than 50,000 and is falling.
Some fear that the wild Asian elephant is headed for extinction.</TE>
<TE>   The Kenya Wildlife Service says 57 Kenyan elephants were killed
for their ivory last year. And 18 more were found slaughtered in May
in protected areas. Because of poaching, Kenya's herds dwindled from
167,000 in 1973 to 16,000 in 1989. The number has risen only slightly
since the trade ban.</TE>
<TE>   For this reason, Kenya opposes even a partial lifting of the ban
favored by Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, where herds are
booming. Those countries want to sell off stocks of ivory taken from
culling to pay for wildlife management.</TE>
<TE>   Jewelry, seals and other elaborately carved ivory pieces have been
prized for centuries in many Asian countries and can be found in
shops from Nepal to South Korea.</TE>

<HD>Tropical Rain Forest Sprouts Battleground</HD>
<DH>Environmentalists are pitted against leftists and Zapatista
rebels in Montes Azules.</DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>LACANJA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>The battle to save North America's last large pocket of tropical rain
forest is shattering old notions of political correctness -- pitting
leftists against environmentalists and Zapatista rebels against other
Indians.</LD>
<LD>   Lacandon Indians, who have lived for centuries in the Montes
Azules jungle near the Guatemalan border, oppose the incursion of
Indian settlers from the nearby highlands. The settlers are clearing
land in the nature reserve to make room for farms.</LD>
<LD>   The Zapatista rebels back the settlers, arguing that Indian
farmers are the best protectors of the rain forest. The rebels accuse
environmentalists who oppose the squatters' movement of being fronts
for corporate plans to exploit jungle resources.</LD>
<TE>   At stake is a major source of fresh water in a parched nation, the
last jungle in North America big enough to support jaguars, and the
habitat of 340 species of birds and dozens of endangered plants and
animals.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict is also raising worries about violence between
Indians. The ideological atmosphere has become so venomous that some
environmental groups have walked away from the debate, despite their
fears that settlement is threatening the jungle's viability.</TE>
<TE>   The rhetoric of Indian rights and anti-globalization is being used
to justify deforestation, which environmentalists argue will benefit
the Indians little because the denuded land can yield crops for only
a couple of seasons.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon in the 1,290-square-mile Montes Azules--Blue
Mountains--the tall canopy of cedar, mahogany and cypress trees was
shrouded in smoke and dotted with farmers' fires.</TE>
<TE>   Huge fire-blackened trunks of cypress trees loomed out of recently
cleared fields.</TE>
<TE>   But the effects of human settlement are felt even in areas where
mammoth Guanacaste trees are still shrouded in vines and bromeliads,
where streams run crystal clear amid enormous ferns, palms and huge
wild elephant's ear plants.</TE>
<TE>   Montes Azules is becoming a silent jungle as settlers carve it
into disconnected patches: in many parts, tapirs, howler monkeys and
parrots are already gone.</TE>
<TE>   Patience is wearing thin among the Lacandones. Living in small,
jungle-friendly clearings for centuries, their number has dwindled to
just 800, but they are the legal owners of much of the reserve--much
more land than they need, the settlers say.</TE>
<TE>   No accurate figure of the settler population is available, but
various estimates put it at 5,000 to 10,000.</TE>
<TE>   "They are coming in, cutting the trees and destroying not just our
land, but our way of life," said Alfonso Chankin, a Lacandon leader
in traditional white cotton tunic, black hair down to his waist. His
clear plastic sandals are one of the few traces of his contact with
the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in halting Spanish in the yard of his thatched-roof home
in Lacanja, Chankin said that "if the government doesn't do anything,
we are going to have to take matters into our own hands and throw
them out ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   The risk of violence is real. On May 31, 26 Indians in nearby
Oaxaca state were massacred by a neighboring community in a similar
land dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Any attempt at eviction by the Lacandones and their allies would
almost certainly spark violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way they will get us out of here is dead," said Manuel,
a Zapatista activist in El Suspiro, a squatter camp deep inside the
reserve. Near his bare wooden shack, felled trees smoldered in a
freshly cleared field.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel, who like many Zapatistas identifies himself only by his
first name, mainly fears government soldiers and police.</TE>
<TE>   Security forces appeared ready in April to forcibly remove the
settlers. But the national government backed off at the request of
Chiapas state officials, who want more talks--although negotiations
appear to be going nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   "We're reaching a critical point where the jungle can't work as an
ecosystem anymore," said Ignacio March, a biologist for
Washington-based Conservation International, one of the few groups
that has braved the rebels' criticism to publicly oppose the
settlements. "For example, a jaguar can't live in a small patch of
jungle. They need a large, continuous habitat."</TE>
<TE>   The rebels say they want to turn Montes Azules into an "Indian
Farmers' Reserve," a patchwork of farms and jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime, the Zapatista "commissioner" who oversees El Suspiro and
several other camps, said the rebels have instructed their supporters
not to burn or chop down trees, but admitted the rule is hard to
enforce.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel, after some prompting from his boss, grudgingly said
farmers should "cut as little as possible."</TE>
<TE>   "This land belonged to my ancestors," said Manuel, whose Tzotzil
forebears actually come from the highlands 80 miles to the east.</TE>
<TE>   Highland Indians began migrating into the reserve in the 1960s,
sometimes encouraged by the government and also pressured by high
population growth and cattle ranchers who stole their land.</TE>
<TE>   In an abrupt about-face in the 1970s, the government declared the
jungle off-limits to settlers and created a nature reserve. It
evicted some squatters and granted the tiny group of Lacandones
ownership of huge tracts in the reserve.</TE>
<TE>   That closing of the last virgin corner of Chiapas bred resentment
in some Indian communities, anger that became the foundation for the
Zapatista movement that appeared 20 years later.</TE>
<TE>   But after the government set up the reserve, it never patrolled or
protected it, and a patchwork system was instituted under which some
squatter camps were allowed to stay. Only about 20 forestry guards
patrol the whole reserve.</TE>
<TE>   "People here don't respect authority anymore," said forest guard
Jorge Luis Gomez. "If we went into the squatters' camps, they'd lynch
us."</TE>
<TE>   From the air, the reserve looks like a vast green blanket
scattered with blue lagoons and brown clearings. The number of
settlements rose sharply after the Zapatistas' 1994 uprising, which
encouraged land takeovers and effectively ended police operations in
the region.</TE>
<TE>   Zapatista members account for only about half the settlements, but
the rebels have effectively blocked the relocation of any settlers by
threatening violence, boycotting talks and occupying vacated jungle
camps.</TE>
<TE>   A poorly financed government relocation program offers some land
and building materials outside the reserve, but running water and
electricity are often lacking.</TE>
<TE>   "The government should accept the communities that are living in
Montes Azules, and allow them to become honorary and permanent
guardians of the biodiversity there," the pro-rebel Fray Bartolome
Human Rights Center said in a June letter to President Vicente Fox.</TE>
<TE>   There is little evidence the squatter camps are protecting
anything. The settlers clear plots for corn, exhausting the soil
after a few harvests, then turn the land into pasture for cattle.</TE>
<TE>   In the newly settled Seis de Octubre camp, 70 families were
hacking into the jungle to build long wooden shacks.</TE>
<TE>   Ebelio Maldonado, a 27-year-old Tzeltal Indian, stood between a
pile of recently felled trees and a smoking field where precious
tropical hardwoods were reduced to ash.</TE>
<TE>   "The Zapatista army sent us here to take care of the land," said
Maldonado, moving his hand in the air to trace the outline of the new
settlement. "We'll plant beans and corn and buy fertilizer, and we'll
take care of everything here in the jungle."</TE>
<TE>   With large families--Manuel has seven children--the settlements
must expand. "We'd like to bring in some cattle and some mechanized
planting," Maldonado said.</TE>
<TE>   The results of that can be seen in the two-thirds of the original
Lacandon jungle outside the reserve that has already been cut down.
Stream beds are dried up, and only a few skinny cows graze on
sun-baked grassland.</TE>
<TE>   Ranchers love grass, but it is the enemy of the jungle. Once it
takes hold, it carpets the ground and interferes with the natural
cycle of regeneration that the Lacandones depend on.</TE>
<TE>   Lacandon farmer Manuel Castellanos curses the grass as he stoops
to pluck it away in his small farm plot in a jungle clearing.</TE>
<TE>   Such clearings can support a Lacandon family for 20 years because
they vary plantings -- yucca and other root crops, fruits and
vegetables, and corn.</TE>
<TE>   The practice allows fields to regenerate, provide second-growth
wood, and be used again for farming.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the heart of the water, the lungs of the world. This is
our heritage," Castellanos said. "And we are losing it."</TE>
<TE>   Biologists hold out hopes that the Lacandones' knowledge of jungle
agriculture--imperfect, but better than the settlers' farming
methods--can be spread to other groups.</TE>
<TE>   But that appears unlikely, given the hostility between the
Lacandones and the Zapatistas, who oppose the very concept of nature
reserves.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lacandones acted selfishly, and against their fellow Indians,
by not sharing the land," said Jaime, the Zapatista area leader.
"There is no way they, all alone, can take advantage of all this
land."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the Lacandones don't want to "take advantage" of the
land--preferring instead to preserve it as an occasional hunting or
fishing ground--is an idea lost in the clash between the two groups'
cultures.</TE>
<TE>   For a movement that demands respect for Indians, the Zapatistas
express open contempt for the Lacandones, calling them a manipulated,
pampered tool of the government.</TE>
<TE>   Rebel sympathizers even refuse to call them Lacandones--the name
the Indians prefer. They insist on calling them "Caribes," the name
of a group of Indians from outside Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   But the Zapatistas aim their harshest attacks at
environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   Many rebel supporters view Zapatista support for squatters as part
of a battle against economic globalization. They see the objections
to the settlements as pretexts to hide corporate conspiracies, or to
help Mexico's conservative government and its now abandoned plan for
a hydroelectric dam near the reserve, or to weaken the Zapatista
movement.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels cite cash donations by the U.S. Agency for
International Development and a Mexican agribusiness company to
Conservation International as proof that the environmentalists want
to sell the jungle's water or genetic samples of wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "They aren't really interested in protecting the reserve. They
want to mine it: for genetic material, for water, for hydroelectric
power," said Andres Aubrey, an anthropologist who has worked in
Chiapas for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Biologist Victor Hugo Hernandez, a former director of the reserve,
counters: "The whole bio-piracy issue is pretty much a pretext to
justify settlement."</TE>
<TE>   The attack from the left -- long an ally of conservation movements
-- has scared off the Washington-based World Wildlife Fund, which in
2000 signed a petition calling for the removal of settlers, but later
dropped that position and now refuses to talk about the reserve.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned our lesson that time. We found ourselves in the middle
of so much polemics that you can't answer them," said Mercedes
Otegui, spokeswoman for the WWF in Mexico. "Our policy is now just
not to get involved."</TE>
<TE>   Homer Aridjis, an environmental activist, said he had been
pressured by Zapatista sympathizers to support settlement. "I told
them I couldn't do it. No political cause, however good, justifies
destroying nature."</TE>
<TE>   "Just because they are Indians, that doesn't justify them
destroying a jungle that is the patrimony of the whole nation, the
whole world," Aridjis said.</TE>
<TE>   March, the biologist at Conservation International, which has
taken the most heat, said, "We're attacked as spies because we use
U.S. satellite images, or because we are based in Washington."</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "the fight is not against us. It's against
deforestation."</TE>

<HD>Raging Wildfires Blanket Russian Cities</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Smoke has cut off visibility, closed airports and
afflicted millions of people. More than 21,700 blazes have burned 2.5
million acres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER BAKER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>NIZHNY NOVGOROD, Russia</DL>
<LD>Maria Kulemina's eyes were ringed red, her voice weary as she trudged
down the main pedestrian boulevard of Russia's third-largest city.</LD>
<LD>   "We're suffering a lot," said Kulemina, 72. "Our eyes hurt and
we're losing our breath. It's very, very hard."</LD>
<LD>   Her friend Antonina Danilova, also 72, pointed to a nearby
building in downtown. "We live on the eighth floor," she said,
pointing to a nearby building, "and we can't even see the top of the
bank."</LD>
<TE>   Danilova was speaking about the effect of raging wildfires that
have spread across Russia this summer, leaving behind the worst smoke
clouds in 30 years. Thick, impenetrable blankets have settled over
some of the largest cities, cutting off visibility, closing down
airports and afflicting millions of people.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, the haze becomes so opaque it's hard to make out
the other side of the Volga River here in Nizhny Novgorod. In Moscow,
the Kremlin and the famous cupolas of St. Basil's Cathedral remain
shrouded even from a modest distance. Airplanes circling over both
cities Thursday had to pull out of their landing patterns and find
other airports where pilots could see the runways.</TE>
<TE>   Residents have adopted survival techniques, especially the
elderly, parents with children and those suffering from asthma. Many
are leaving town. Those who cannot are trying to block out the
polluted air or restrict their movements.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't go outside in the morning," said Lyubov Slavyanova, 66,
who was caring for her 3-year-old grandson, Dima. "We close the
windows. And for the night, we hang wet bedsheets. We go out only in
early evening. That's what the doctors told us -- don't go out for a
walk with the children during the day because it's bad for them."</TE>
<TE>   Russia, one-ninth of the world's land mass, seems constantly at
war with some natural disaster or another. Floods in the south
recently dislocated many residents. Severe cold in the far east
during winter months regularly threatens whole cities left vulnerable
by man-made energy shortages. Rivers in Siberia remain frozen so late
into spring that they block currents and result in floods; on
occasion, military jets are called in to bomb the ice and break it
up.</TE>
<TE>   Although emergency workers have successfully beaten back fires and
prevented them from inflicting widespread destruction, they can do
little to lift the veils of smoke choking Moscow, Nizhny and other
cities. With little wind or rain, the smoke sits over crowded urban
centers already enduring an unusually hot summer.</TE>
<TE>   The heat wave and the exceptionally dry season have ushered in a
wave of forest and peat bog fires unlike any seen since 1972. The
Emergency Situations Ministry has recorded 21,764 blazes throughout
the country this season, covering about 2.5 million acres. That would
be the equivalent of half of New Jersey going up in flames. At the
moment, about 250,000 acres remain on fire.</TE>
<TE>   In Nizhny and around Moscow, the big problem is peat bog, a
fuel-like terrain that smolders underground and sends smoke plumes
into the air. Workers can soak it with water and try to cover it with
sand, but putting out such fires altogether is exceptionally
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "There is only one solution here -- a strong, constant rain that
lasts a long time," said Yuri Sentyurin, first deputy governor of
Nizhny. "Otherwise, there's no way to stop the smoking turf."</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Valery Korkodola, head of the local office of the Emergency
Situations Ministry, said he has 1,600 firefighters, engineers and
others working around-the-clock. "This whole situation is under
control," he said after returning from a tour of the worst area in
the region. "The situation is getting better, not worse."</TE>
<TE>   Korkodola's fire brigades managed to save a small village from
annihilation a few days ago. As fire crept ever closer to Kerzhenets,
nearly an hour's drive from Nizhny, firefighters tried to stop it at
the main road, only to have it leap across and ignite bales of hay.
Rescue workers decided to evacuate the village of small, ramshackle
wooden houses.</TE>
<TE>   To save Kerzhenets, firefighters, joined by local residents and a
group of 10-year-old boys given backpacks filled with water and
spouts to spray, battled the blaze for hours until they got it under
control.</TE>

<HD>Fire Lookout's Resume Offers Magic, Memories</HD>
<DH>The West: For more than 30 years, Virginia has kept vigil
from her Montana aerie. A boy turned a man makes a fateful
pilgrimage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN MacDONALD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>HUSON, Mont.</DL>
<LD>It is a moment from childhood branded into memory. A little boy in
pajamas sat with his dad, staring through binoculars across the Six
Mile Valley to the top of Stark Mountain.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe Virginia forgot," the boy said. Keep watching, his father
assured him.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, as the sun threatened to turn the evening sky orange, the
first flash of reflected light from Virginia's signal mirror caught
the boy's eye. Then came another, and another.</LD>
<TE>   "There she is!" the boy yelled.</TE>
<TE>   His father pulled the pencil and pad from his shirt pocket and
jotted down each flash as the boy called them out. "One long, another
long, I think. One short...." It was hard to tell.</TE>
<TE>   When the reflections stopped, the little boy turned to his father.
"What did she say?"</TE>
<TE>   His dad paused, drew a final few marks on the pad and turned it to
the boy to see. In big block letters, he had written, "H-I-J-O-H-N."</TE>
<TE>   It was 30 years ago, yet every bit of that evening is vivid. My
pajamas were red and my fingers sticky from ice cream. The moment
alone with Dad was too rare, and the greeting from Virginia in her
fire tower atop the mountain at the end of our valley was like magic.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Vincent greets visitors to the top of her mountain as if
she is surprised that they got here at all.</TE>
<TE>   "You made it," she says, peering over the balcony of her fire
tower. "How was the road?"</TE>
<TE>   The "road" to Stark Mountain is a rough one -- a narrow, 15-mile
Jeep trail, steep with endless switchbacks, sheer drops and sharp
rocks known to puncture gas tanks.</TE>
<TE>   But once at the top, just beyond where big trees won't grow, amid
a field of bear grass and red Indian paintbrush, one understands why
Vincent, now 71, has come back here for more than 30 summers to be
the Stark Mountain fire lookout.</TE>
<TE>   At 7,352 feet -- "plus 20," Vincent adds, if you count from her
balcony -- the view is breathtaking.</TE>
<TE>   As far as the eye can see, it is a vista of valleys, ringed by
rugged mountains, followed by more valleys, until it all seems to
dissolve together with the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Here, Vincent lives every summer in the tiny 15-by-15-foot fire
tower, watching over the scenery for the first signs of new wildfires
-- "smokes," she calls them. Western Montana has escaped the dreadful
fires burning throughout much of the West this summer, which means
that it's been a slow season for Vincent.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it can be a horribly boring job," Vincent says. "You
can go a long time without seeing a smoke."</TE>
<TE>   With Vincent, though, there is a sense that the job is only a tiny
reason why she is here. Never married and clearly not a woman of
extravagance, Vincent has carved out a unique life atop Stark
Mountain -- one of contented solitude, simple living and an
insatiable appetite to learn about everything around her.</TE>
<TE>   She interrupts herself over a long cup of coffee to point out a
small sparrow hawk -- "it's a kestrel," she corrects -- hanging
nearly motionless on the wind just outside her tower window.</TE>
<TE>   On a short walk over her lunch break, she stops herself again,
drops to her knees and buries her face in a squatty shrub bathed in
tiny red flowers.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, come here, you have to smell this," she coaxes. "It's red
mountain heather. It has the most wonderful fragrance."</TE>
<TE>   "There's nobody like Virginia," says Dave Ramirez, assistant fire
manager at the Forest Service's Nine Mile Ranger Station, where
Vincent is assigned.</TE>
<TE>   She's considered a bit of a legend at the station, having
outlasted half a dozen rangers, and she's the area expert on plants
and birds of western Montana.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a sad day when she decides she doesn't want to do this
anymore," Ramirez says.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't seem to be a big concern yet. Her hair is gray, and
Vincent admits that she hikes a bit slower than she used to. But she
is fit, her eyes are still good and she shows no sign of wanting to
give up her seasonal post.</TE>
<TE>   "Every January, I ask myself if I really think I want to do it
again," Vincent says. "But come July, here I am.... I can't think of
anything else I would ever want to do."</TE>
<TE>   Vincent had wanted to be a lookout since 1946, when, as a
teenager, she read a magazine article about a woman who spent her
summers in a fire lookout.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, "I've always had it in my mind that this is what I
wanted," says Vincent, who has a bachelor's degree in zoology and
works at a herbarium at the University of Montana in Missoula when
she's not at Stark Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   She first applied with the Forest Service to be a paid seasonal
lookout in 1960, but was turned down. Ten years later, she tried
again and was hired. They assigned her to Stark Mountain. Except for
one summer in the early 1980s, when she worked as a lookout in
Oregon, she has been here every year.</TE>
<TE>   There is no television at Stark, no computer, not even running
water. Electricity to operate her two-way Forest Service radio and a
cell phone comes from two car batteries hooked to a solar charger.
The bathroom is a rickety outhouse 300 feet down the hill. It's been
here almost as many summers as Vincent.</TE>
<TE>   Her tower is spartan inside -- a woodstove for heat, a small bed,
a table with a tiny Smith-Corona typewriter, two chairs, a propane
fridge and cooking stove. The middle of the room is taken up by the
Osborne Fire Finder, a circular map and compass contraption used for
decades by lookouts to pinpoint a fire's location.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia has been a spotter so many years, she hardly needs it
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "She knows every mountain and drainage around her," Ramirez says.
"She calls in smokes not only in our district, but the districts
around us."</TE>
<TE>   When Vincent started 33 years ago, there were 20 manned lookouts,
including Stark, in the Lolo National Forest, the district she
watches over. Today, with changing technology, greater use of aerial
spotters in airplanes and shifts in Forest Service priorities, there
are just five.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the towers were dismantled or closed because they fell
into disrepair. Others have been turned into rental cabins for hikers
and hunters.</TE>
<TE>   The Stark fire tower, rebuilt in 1963 after the first tower began
to deteriorate, is still considered essential. And because the Forest
Service hasn't had trouble finding someone to staff it, it's probably
going to be around for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a job for everyone," Ramirez says. "It can be awfully
lonely.... It really does take a special person to spend three months
alone on a mountain."</TE>
<TE>   Vincent says she's never lonely. Visitors find their way to the
lookout all the time. But even when they don't, she has plenty to

<TE>   "The secret really of being happy on a lookout these days is

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years earlier, Stark Mountain was about the most
interesting, mysterious place possible for a 5-year-old kid in the
Six Mile Valley. I knew nothing about Virginia, except what Dad told
me. She lived in a little tower on top of the mountain, they both
spent summers watching for forest fires, and she was better at it
than he was. For that alone, she had earned his respect.</TE>
<TE>   He came home one day from his summer job as an aerial fire spotter
and said he had talked with Virginia on the radio. She was going to
try to send me a message by signal mirror that evening at dusk.</TE>
<TE>   We didn't tell my brothers. It was just Dad, me, a couple of ice
cream cones and his binoculars. In a rare moment for both of us, we
sat on the porch, doing nothing but waiting for sunset.</TE>
<TE>   Do you remember 30 years ago when you signaled me by mirror? I
asked Virginia as my visit to Stark Mountain wrapped up.</TE>
<TE>   Vaguely, Virginia said. It was a long time ago, but there was a
time when she would exchange simple flashed greetings with people in
the valley and even other lookouts.</TE>
<TE>   I told her my dad had said she flashed, "Hi, John," in Morse Code.</TE>
<TE>   She smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to even tell you this," she said. "But I never learned
Morse code."</TE>
<TE>   There is a bit of me that was devastated. All those years, I had
repeated the story about my little magical moment with Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   She quickly reminded me that the magic had still happened. Credit
had just gone to the wrong magician.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a very sweet thing of your dad to do," she said. "That
is a wonderful way to remember it.... Sometimes our memories are
better than reality anyway."</TE>

<HD>Will Ecology Trump Pivotal Battle in Pacific?</HD>
<DH>Midway: Historians, veterans and government officials seek
to balance islands' standing as a national wildlife refuge and a
military memorial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>B.J. REYES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY ATOLL</DL>
<LD>To World War II veterans, these remote islands one-third of the way
from Honolulu to Tokyo will always be known as the site where the
fortunes of war in the Pacific shifted in favor of the United States.</LD>
<LD>   But ever since the Navy closed its air base here in 1993, more
attention has been paid to the birds, turtles, seals and other
wildlife that inhabited the atoll long before the military.</LD>
<LD>   Since March, when an environmental tour operator shut down, public
access to Midway has been very limited. Officials say they hope to
restart such a service that could both protect the ecology and
provide some visitation to the historic atoll of three tiny islands</LD>
<TE>   Today, historians, veterans and government officials are left to
balance Midway's standing as both a national wildlife refuge and a
military memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense, that is a monument in and of itself to the veterans
of Midway and World War II because only in a free, prosperous America
could such a thing exist," Assistant Interior Secretary H. Craig
Manson said during a recent trip to Midway to commemorate the 60th
anniversary of the Battle of Midway.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think that giving us the ability to do those two
things here on this island, surrounded by these seas, is part of what
you [veterans] were fighting for and is part of the legacy that you
have left us."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone agrees.</TE>
<TE>   At least one Midway historian says not enough is being done to
honor those who fought and died during the battle from June 4-6,
1942.</TE>
<TE>   "American lives were lost, blood was shed and, clearly, this is a
very important part of America's culture and history," said James
D'Angelo, who founded the International Midway Memorial Foundation to
raise awareness of the battle.</TE>
<TE>   "Recognition is very important today because of the values that
the men who fought in the Battle of Midway exemplified," he added.
Midway played a key role in World War II as a location that the
Japanese sought to establish as a forward outpost. For three days,
American dive bombers and fighter pilots fended off the Japanese
naval fleet's attempt to secure Midway, sinking four of the fleet's
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The atoll provided a key port for U.S. ships and submarines that
allowed them to remain in the theater of battle without having to
return to Pearl Harbor or the U.S. mainland for maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   But Midway's strategic importance has diminished over time.</TE>
<TE>   The Naval Air Facility on Midway was closed and the atoll was
turned over in 1996 to the Interior Department to be managed as a
wildlife refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the wildlife refuge experience included ecotours -- a
chance for the public to experience first-hand the pristine beaches,
crystal-blue lagoons and even get up close with the ever-present
gooney birds.</TE>
<TE>   But contractor Midway Phoenix Corp. ceased operations in March,
citing U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service restrictions that made it too
difficult to be profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Barbara Maxfield has said
that the agency tried to work with Midway Phoenix since it began
operations in 1996, but that wildlife is the agency's primary
concern.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean public access will be restricted for good. A
temporary contractor has been brought in to maintain core services at
Midway until a long-term operator can be found.</TE>
<TE>   Critics such as D'Angelo say the agency has an opportunity to do
more for the military while also maintaining standards for wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "The first step," he said, "would be for the atoll itself to be
recognized as a national memorial with a visibility point, when you
arrive off the plane, to a large, visible sign that says it's a
wildlife refuge."</TE>
<TE>   Manson agreed: There is room on the atoll to accommodate history
and ecology.</TE>
<TE>   "We will honor, we will remember and, above all, we will thank you
by what we do here both ecologically and historically," he told
veterans.</TE>

<HD>Mother Gets New Lease on Life After Exoneration</HD>
<DH>Law: Woman had been sentenced to 116 years in prison after
her children testified she had sexually abused them. They eventually
recanted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GILLIAN FLACCUS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>McMINNVILLE, Ore. -- Pamela Reser first heard the terrible
accusations at a court hearing, when a longtime friend petitioned to
adopt her three young boys.</LD>
<LD>   "Your son has been saying you did things to him," Reser remembers
the friend saying.</LD>
<LD>   Reser, confused and addicted to alcohol and methamphetamines,
brushed it off. But the ugly allegations didn't go away.</LD>
<TE>   Within months, four of Reser's children -- aged 8 and under at the
time of the alleged abuse -- would testify that their mother engaged
in sexual acts with them and forced them to have sex with each other.
In 1999, a judge sentenced her to 116 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Reser endured the stony silence of prisoners who called her freak
and monster behind her back. She tried to study, exercise and pray.
She got used to keeping to herself, even in her darkest moments.</TE>
<TE>   She told her attorneys that she was innocent. She was sure that
someday, when they were older, her children would take back what they
said.</TE>
<TE>   She was right.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, all charges against her were dismissed, and Reser was
released after spending more than three years behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   In May, an unrelated investigation turned up evidence that some of
the four children, who now are ages 13 to 18, had recanted their
accusations. State police detectives followed up. One by one, the
children took back what they'd said under oath.</TE>
<TE>   Not Mad at Children</TE>
<TE>   Now Reser, 37, is trying to rebuild her life and wondering why her
children lied. She insists that she is not mad at them and has tried
to find the positive in a traumatic experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad the way it went, but I'm not angry," she said, fingering
the gold cross around her neck. "It's a miracle if you stop and think
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Police say they believe that someone brainwashed the children into
testifying against their mother, but they have made no arrests.</TE>
<TE>   The five children in all, who have new adoptive parents and new
last names, could not be reached for comment. They have different
biological fathers, none of whom are involved in their lives, Reser
said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they were stunned by the children's admissions.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no indication that this was a memorized story and that
this was something they had gotten together and arranged," said Cal
Tichenor, Yamhill County deputy district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Admissions Comforting</TE>
<TE>   Reser is comforted by those admissions.</TE>
<TE>   "My kids, they knew in their heart, they knew that I didn't do
those things," she said. "They came forward, and I was just so glad
for them."</TE>
<TE>   Reser is now staying with friends. "I have a second chance at
life," she said.</TE>
<TE>   While locked up, she managed to get sober, take classes,
rediscover her religious faith, and physically challenge herself with
daily jogging and weightlifting.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be so easy for her to just kind of give up," said her
attorney, Stephen Palmer. "It's frankly pretty inspiring to see a
person turn such a negative thing into a positive thing."</TE>
<TE>   Reser's road to prison began with a 1998 custody hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Four years before, her children had been placed in foster homes
because of Reser's addictions and neglect. This time, she was before
a judge to try to regain custody of a fifth child, a baby girl.</TE>
<TE>   But at the hearing, she learned that a secret indictment had been
filed detailing sexual abuses that she allegedly committed against
her children.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 17, 1998, police arrested her, and she was charged with
rape and sodomy.</TE>
<TE>   The older children said the crimes happened between 1988 and 1994,
ending when the state took custody of them. When they accused her,
Reser had not seen them for at least three years. She had been living
on the street or with friends, lost in her addictions.</TE>
<TE>   Reser insisted that she had never touched her children in those
ways. She began to think that God might be punishing her for
abandoning her responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran, I ran hard. I was on a suicide mission -- it's sad, but
it's true," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I held a lot of guilt for the things that I did to my children,
not being there for them. Maybe because of the lifestyle that I
lived, one of my boyfriends could have done these things behind my
back," Reser said. "That crossed my mind."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Reser wasn't prepared for what happened during the five-day
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors cried. Those who originally looked at Reser with sympathy
later refused to make eye contact. The court had to take a break
during the youngest boy's testimony because the stuffed animal he
clung to was sopping with tears.</TE>
<TE>   'I Was Traumatized'</TE>
<TE>   Another child read a letter to his mother during sentencing,
saying, "I don't know why they can't just kill you and get it over
with."</TE>
<TE>   Said Reser: "I was wondering who put those words in their mouth,
because I knew I didn't do those things to them. I was really
wondering what was going on. I was traumatized."</TE>
<TE>   Tichenor called it "the most horrendous case that I have
prosecuted."</TE>
<TE>   On May 15, three detectives arrived at Coffee Creek Correctional
Facility to tell Reser that her children had confessed to falsely
accusing her.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'Well, your kids recanted.' I was running back and
forth and I said, 'Say it again, one more time.' I didn't even know
if I'd get out of prison, but I didn't care," Reser said.</TE>
<TE>   A 'Lost Puppy'</TE>
<TE>   When Reser was freed two weeks later, "she was like a little lost
puppy," said her mother, Millie Reser. "She just stayed close to the
wall, she was so scared."</TE>
<TE>   Tichenor says he is now convinced of Reser's innocence, but he
will not charge the children with perjury.</TE>
<TE>   "I believed very much that she was guilty at the time," he said.
"But I am satisfied that if we had the evidence then that we have now
that she never would have been convicted."</TE>
<TE>   Reser believes that her release is a chance to get her life back
on track.</TE>
<TE>   She is learning to enjoy the small things -- having a private
bathroom, sleeping in, walking on the beach and wearing civilian
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   She savors the memory of her first meal on the outside -- a Burger
King Whopper with cheese, an order of fries, a Sprite and chocolate
pie.</TE>
<TE>   She hopes to earn a high school equivalency degree, get a job at a
fast-food restaurant and move into her own apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to start somewhere," she said. "I don't want to take one
day for granted anymore."</TE>

<HD>A Four Seasons Lifestyle and a Vegas Skyline--for $500,000</HD>
<DH>Housing: High-rise condominiums offer maintenance-free
living and feature such perks as concierge service and wine cellars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA SNEDEKER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>In the opulent Stirling Club, members relax at an elegant piano bar,
compete in a game of billiards while puffing on a Cohiba cigar or
rejuvenate in the anti-aging Vinotherapie Spa.</LD>
<LD>   In the Park Towers subterranean wine cellar, members of the
private enclave are treated to tasting parties with guest sommeliers
and dinners prepared by renowned chefs such as Gustav Mauler.
Afterward, they can catch a film in a Hollywood-style screening room.</LD>
<LD>   These particular decadences aren't reserved for high-rollers in
the Las Vegas Strip's glittering megaresorts. They are everyday perks
for a different kind of members-only club--the resort condominium
owner.</LD>
<TE>   "If you want a bottle of Opus at 2 a.m., you're going to get it,"
said Cindy DellaValle, Park Towers sales director. "It's a Four
Seasons lifestyle that's very private."</TE>
<TE>   Developers are using spectacular views and proximity to the action
coupled with hotel-style amenities such as round-the-clock concierge
service to lure residents to several new luxury high-rise condominium
resorts just off the Las Vegas Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "We are selling a lifestyle," said Jeffrey Soffer, developer of
the $600-million Turnberry Place.</TE>
<TE>   What many perceived as a gamble--the first upscale high-rise
community to be built in Las Vegas in nearly 30 years--is paying off.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the 740 units in the four-tower project have
been sold, Soffer said.</TE>
<TE>   And only a few available condominiums remain at the $120-million
Park Towers, co-developed by casino mogul Steve Wynn, who created the
Bellagio and Mirage hotel-casinos, and real estate entrepreneur Irwin
Molasky. Each owns one of the 84 residences in the 20-story towers
adjacent to private gardens and tennis courts inside the Hughes
Center, just east of the Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Luxury condominiums are even luring Donald Trump to Sin City. The
real estate and casino developer recently announced a partnership
with New Frontier hotel-casino owner Phil Ruffin to build a 60-story,
300-unit condominium tower less than a block from the Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to bring a level of quality design, construction,
services and amenities in high-rise development that Las Vegas has
not yet seen," Trump said in announcing the $300-million Trump Tower
Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's only steps away from 99-cent shrimp cocktails and
free well drinks for gamblers, the high-rise lifestyle in Las Vegas
doesn't come cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Condominiums at Turnberry Place and Park Towers range from
$500,000 to $5 million-plus.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very small piece of the pie," DellaValle said of the
potential buyer market. "It's not about a price per square foot. It's
all about image and how it [the condominium] enhances your life and
the lifestyle you want to lead. Lifestyle living is a want, it's not
a need."</TE>
<TE>   Developers know it takes more than impressive square footage and
Corian countertops to attract buyers in the million-plus price range.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to imported marble, Turnberry's units feature private
elevator lobbies, whirlpool baths and floor-to-ceiling glass walls
that open to private balconies.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the perks one wouldn't find in most single-family
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Valet and porter service as well as concierge, room and limousine
service provide the advantage of a totally luxurious lifestyle for
our residents," said John Riordan, Turnberry's vice president of
sales and marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Park Towers' residents enter the lobby under a dome that was hand
painted by Russian emigre Genia.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers include corporations, empty-nesters and second-home owners
looking for a life free from yard work and full of convenience.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, you will find people in a high rise who want to retire
yet lead an active lifestyle," DellaValle said.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Tomich, a 35-year-old real estate agent, is trading her
upscale home on the Red Rock Country Club golf course in the city's
western outskirts for Turnberry's views, airport accessibility,
security and maintenance-free living.</TE>
<TE>   "I live by myself, so one of the most important things for me was
security," she said. "I travel a lot and I don't have to worry when I
travel, I just lock the door. A limo takes you to the airport and
when you come home, they are there to pick you up."</TE>
<TE>   Tomich said her condominium is less expensive to maintain than her
country club home, which was a 30-minute drive from the Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "You have all the luxuries of life and incredible views from the
tower," she said. "When you wake up in the morning, your car is
vacuumed. It's hard to beat a lifestyle like this. It's like being on
vacation 365 days a year."</TE>
<TE>   Celebrities living at Turnberry Place include actor James Caan and
stand-up funny woman Rita Rudner, who headlines at the New York-New
York hotel-casino.</TE>
<TE>   "We like living there," said Rudner, referring to her husband and
their dog. "We're in a high-rise on the same floor I was on in a
high-rise in New York."</TE>
<TE>   Socializing at Turnberry Place centers around the $40-million,
80,000-square-foot Stirling Club, which includes public and private
dining areas, where members can eat off fine china and partake of a
classic vintage from private wine lockers, an amenity also offered at
Park Towers.</TE>
<TE>   Nonresidents can join the club for a $5,000 initiation fee and
monthly dues between $165 and $330 if referred by a member.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm from Southern California, the Newport Beach area, and there's
nothing like it down there or in Las Vegas," Tomich said. "When you
enter the Stirling Club, everyone knows you and they greet you by
name."</TE>
<TE>   Demand for such residences where valet attendants hand vacuum cars
and the swimming pool misters spray Evian water remains to be seen,
but at least one real estate expert believes the market for high-rise
residences will continue to grow.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Bottfeld, senior analyst for the home building industry
research firm Marketing Solutions, points to the Polo Towers
expansion on the Strip as evidence of the expanding timeshare market.</TE>
<TE>   "That is going to continue to condition the market for the
high-rise phenomenon," he said. "Are we going to see a high-rise a
week? No. Are we going to see four, five or six high-rises over the
next decade or so? Probably, because it makes sense."</TE>

The doctor hopes to unlock the genetic risks of the community, which
often intermarries.</DH>

<DL>MIDDLEFIELD, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Freida Miller, her hair pulled back tightly under her Amish bonnet,
gently cradled her frail 7-year-old daughter in her lap in a backyard
swing.</LD>
<LD>   Kristina's arms and legs droop limply to her mother's sides and
her head stays upright only when she is placed between neck supports
in a padded walker.</LD>
<LD>   Kristina has cerebral palsy symptoms, juvenile arthritis and
glaucoma, which the energetic new doctor in town suspects are related
to genetics.</LD>
<TE>   Amish have traditionally married among themselves.</TE>
<TE>   China-born Heng Wang was hired as the first physician of the Das
Deutsch Center for Special Needs Children, a clinic dedicated to
serving the tight-knit Amish community of northeastern Ohio and
unlocking its genetic risks.</TE>
<TE>   Wang began making house calls in late spring, and the clinic
officially opened with a community reception in June.</TE>
<TE>   In mostly rural Geauga County, located between Cleveland and
Youngstown, Amish represent about 12% of the population but nearly
half the local cases of severe mental and physical retardation.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, whose husband, Dan, is a "distant, very distant" cousin,
has a sister who lost a nearly blind 5-year-old son to degenerative
neuropathy, a nervous-system disorder believed to be inherited.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Miller has a mentally retarded sister.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Graf, a genetic counselor at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, said marrying a relative increases the risk
that both parents will be carriers of a rare genetic disorder.</TE>
<TE>   He said rare inherited conditions occur less frequently in other
groups that have less intermarriage, and thus bigger gene pools.</TE>
<TE>   The Millers have four healthy children, ranging in age from 7
months to 15. Kristina can't talk or sit up by herself. Despite
glaucoma, her vision is good and her eyes follow Wang as he goes
about his exam.</TE>
<TE>   The first hint that something was wrong with Kristina came early.
"She didn't do things that babies normally do," her mother said,
"like reach for toys."</TE>
<TE>   At the Miller home, Wang removes Kristina's lacy sock to check an
inflamed foot that appears to be healing. He isn't sure whether the
swelling is related to Kristina's other problems.</TE>
<TE>   The Ohio facility is modeled on a pioneering clinic in Strasburg,
Pa., in the heart of Pennsylvania's Amish community.</TE>
<TE>   That 13-year-old clinic was founded by Dr. Holmes Morton, who has
identified more than 80 genetic disorders among the Amish.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these are metabolic disorders -- such as glutaric aciduria
and maple syrup disease, named for the odor of the victim's urine --
which can cause brain damage. Morton has emphasized infant screening
and detailed attention to routine sicknesses that can lead to
life-threatening complications.</TE>
<TE>   About a third of the genetic disorders Morton identified can be
successfully treated if caught early, giving children a chance for a
normal life, Wang said.</TE>
<TE>   The Das Deutsch Center raised $700,000 in start-up money through
foundation grants and community fund-raising, including auctions of
Amish quilts and buggies.</TE>
<TE>   The financial backing will help supplement doctor fees, said Tom
Stone, the board's president. No fee schedule has been set, but the
board hopes to keep doctor fees below the $60 to $100 charged by
other physicians in the area, said JoAnn Leach, a clinic board
member.</TE>
<TE>   The state helps pay for the care of multiple disabled youngsters,
and some Amish have self-insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Along with treating young patients, Wang eventually plans to do
genetic research locally and in conjunction with researchers
elsewhere. Backers emphasize that the clinic's genetic findings can
help other close-knit communities.</TE>
<TE>   While many pediatricians might see dozens of patients each day,
Wang expects to see maybe four, and most during house calls.</TE>
<TE>   "These patients are complicated," the 39-year-old Wang said. "It's
pretty challenging for the physician."</TE>
<TE>   He said a physician aware of a patient's complex problems and
medications would be able to manage a new problem without, for
instance, duplicating a test done by a consulting doctor.</TE>
<TE>   That can offer convenience important in the sometimes-isolated
Amish community, where people shun electricity and travel by
horse-drawn buggies on roads increasingly clogged by commuter and
tourist traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Kristina has been to many doctors, some as far
away as Akron and Cleveland, a two-hour round trip that can cost up
to $50 to $75 by taxi.</TE>
<TE>   Some Amish families in the area have several children with
multiple disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 36, said she has learned to cope with Kristina's
disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as she's comfortable, I'm happy," she said as she ducked
out of the aim of a photographer recording the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Most Amish don't want to be photographed, based on religious
tenets.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to accept it as it is because that's probably the way God
wanted her to be," Miller said as a daughter and son watched in the
family's farmhouse kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Wang spent several weeks making mostly social visits to his
prospective patients while getting his medical license in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   He has been impressed by the love shown to the disabled Amish
youngsters by parents.</TE>
<TE>   "They feel they are special kids," he said. "They are also God's
gifts. They take care of them very well."</TE>
<TE>   It was that spirit amid the Amish communities that convinced Wang
and his wife that they should move with their two children, ages 5
and 9, from Little Rock, Ark.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be able to do my research, I'll be able to take care of my
patients," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wang, who was born in Anhui, China, said his accent and foreign
background haven't been a cultural barrier in the Amish community.</TE>
<TE>   "We got off well," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He smiles as he recalls the hospitality of the Amish, who are
known for their huge dinners.</TE>
<TE>   "I just use common sense," he said. "I respect them. I respect
their culture."</TE>

<HD>White House Is Told to Justify Cheney Secrecy</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge says he will release identities of those on
the vice president's energy task force unless he gets specific
reasons not to.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURIE KELLMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge warned Bush administration lawyers Friday that he
would reject efforts to block the release of records on Vice
President Dick Cheney's energy task force unless the White House
provides specific reasons.</LD>
<LD>   At a hearing on two lawsuits, the Justice Department revealed that
Secretary of State Colin Powell may have been invited to some of the
task force meetings. The department provided no details.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan told government lawyers that
simply citing special presidential privileges or the Constitution
would not be enough to keep task force records from public view.</LD>
<TE>   "It is not appropriate to say, 'executive privilege,' " Sullivan
said to lawyers for the administration. "It is not appropriate to
say, 'This request is unconstitutional.'</TE>
<TE>   "I need to know what the basis is," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan gave the government until Sept. 3 to make that argument
when it answers a motion by the plaintiffs to release all White House
records relating to the energy task force.</TE>
<TE>   The lecture was the latest sign that Sullivan is running out of
patience with the administration as two groups seek records about
whether the Cheney task force was influenced by industry executives
in crafting the nation's energy policy.</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club, an environmental organization, and Judicial
Watch, a conservative watchdog group, have filed lawsuits to shed
light on the task force's membership and its influences.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, who was appointed by former President Clinton, chastised
the administration's lawyers in July for advocating too broad a legal
view of executive privilege. The proper approach, he said, is to
examine whether disclosure would prevent the executive branch from
carrying out any constitutionally assigned function.</TE>
<TE>   Run by Cabinet heads, the Cheney panel directed federal agencies
writing a plan last year that focused on energy production -- a
position favored by the industry.</TE>
<TE>   The administration maintains that only government employees were
members of the task force, which disbanded last year. But Judicial
Watch alleges that former Enron chairman Kenneth Lay was a member.</TE>
<TE>   "We want all of the information on the energy task force to come
out as soon as possible," said Larry Klayman, chairman of Judicial
Watch.</TE>
<TE>   That could take months. Sullivan said Friday that he anticipates
objections from the administration that would take "an enormous
amount of time for this court to resolve."</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Watch and the Sierra Club maintain that Cheney's panel is
subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, designed to open
government panels in the executive branch to public scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   The idea behind the law is that public disclosure would counteract
lobbying by special interests.</TE>

<HD>Pride Transcends Anger Over Ancestor's Bondage</HD>
<DH>Heritage: In researching his roots, a black Southerner has
found meaning in honoring the Confederacy that enslaved his ancestor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA SANMINIATELLI</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALEM, Va.</DL>
<LD>At times, the research was painful for William Holland.</LD>
<LD>   Court records, family documents and visits to museums yielded
evidence of slaves, the ships that carried them and the tools that
restrained them.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Holland's genealogical quest has taken him to a place many
blacks consider just as offensive: the Sons of Confederate Veterans.</LD>
<TE>   Holland was accepted for membership in the Confederate group
because his great-great-grandfather, Creed Holland, was a slave wagon
driver who was forced to serve in the Confederate infantry. Two of
William Holland's brothers also have signed up, a third is
considering it, and a sister has applied for membership in the United
Daughters of the Confederacy.</TE>
<TE>   Holland called his ancestor's service -- albeit forced -- a point
of immense pride.</TE>
<TE>   "During the whole fiasco with the Civil War, a lot of men didn't
come home. It was a tough time, and to survive that and come back
alive was an accomplishment," he said. "Our grandfather fought with
them, so there will be some respect for us and for our family."</TE>
<TE>   SCV officials say minorities are almost certainly a part of the
membership in every Southern chapter, although the exact number is
unknown because applicants aren't asked their race.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we'd like to have more black or minority members
because the fact that we have minorities and welcome them deflects
some of the criticism we seem to get, primarily because of the battle
flag," said Ben C. Sewell III, who heads the 30,000-member group.
Founded in 1896 to honor the Confederate dead, the SCV has
successfully fought to get the Confederate flag logo on license
plates in several states. At the same time, the group's leaders have
also spent considerable time maintaining that it's possible to defend
the Confederacy without being a racist.</TE>
<TE>   The only requirement for membership in the group is proof that a
direct ancestor served "honorably" in the Confederate Army.</TE>
<TE>   An SCV fact sheet says tens of thousands of blacks served the
Confederate army as laborers, teamsters, cooks and soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   A Civil War historian, noting that there is little research on
blacks in the Confederate army, said slaves were forced into service.
A "handful" of blacks fought on the Confederate side, said Gary W.
Gallagher, who holds a chair in Civil War history at the University
of Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "You often see these wildly inflated figures of black soldiers in
the Confederate army -- 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 -- the implication
being that they carried muskets and fought, and that is simply not
true," Gallagher said. "The overwhelming majority of black
Confederate soldiers -- and you can put that in quotation marks --
didn't want to be there but were made to be there."</TE>
<TE>   For many blacks, the notion of joining a group honoring the
Confederacy that enslaved their ancestors is incomprehensible.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even fathom why they would want to be a part of this,"
said Milton Reid, who founded the Virginia chapter of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference. "I think there are some things we
have done in the past that should die. And this should die. I'm
talking about the whole idea of the Confederacy."</TE>
<TE>   But for Holland and his brothers, joining the SCV -- and paying
the $34 annual membership fee -- is a way to honor their ancestors
and better understand what motivates the group.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to learn both sides of it ... and also educate others by
what I might learn," said Holland, 33, who lives in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard," he added, "especially for our side. But you can't
always sweep things under the carpet. At some point, you just have to
sit down and talk about it. That's the best way you can resolve
issues, period."</TE>
<TE>   Holland's curiosity was aroused years ago by the stories his
father, Sam Holland Sr., told about growing up in segregated
Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   He knew that his great-great-grandfather had been a slave on a
Franklin County plantation owned by descendants of Thomas Johnson
Holland, who bought the 732 acres of land in 1850.</TE>
<TE>   While leafing through Franklin County's court records, William
Holland discovered Creed Holland's marriage license from 1868. His
research eventually led him to Hazel Holland Davis, whose family
owned Creed Holland and who still lives in the family home. She also
was researching her ancestors and had unearthed a list of slaves who
had received Confederate pensions. Creed Holland was among them.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Davis mentioned Creed Holland's service record to Robert
W. "Red" Barbour, the SCV's former state commander. Barbour knew John
Wayne Holland and invited him to join.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt honored," said John Holland, 47. "It's a good education to
be able to get along with people from all walks of life. And history
is history, so you go back in time and learn things."</TE>
<TE>   William followed soon after and, a few weeks later, 37-year-old
Ben Holland signed the SCV papers.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers said they were surprised to learn their grandfather
had served in the Confederate Army. They said they were not taught
about the role of slaves or free blacks in the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people don't want to learn about it," said Ben Holland,
a maintenance supervisor for the American Red Cross in Roanoke. "But
you've got to relive history. How are you going to outline your
future if you don't know about your past?"</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't find the Confederate flag offensive. Many of his school
friends displayed it on their cars and outside their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't no big deal. It wasn't no racist deal. It's heritage,"
he said. "A lot of people say that's hatred. No, it's not; it's
heritage."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the brothers say they haven't been criticized for joining
the SCV.</TE>
<TE>   "It's their constitutional right and their heritage, and they
shouldn't be harassed," Barbour said. "And the harassment is going to
come from their side, not ours."</TE>
<TE>   William Holland said he hopes to turn his research into a book or
documentary about the friendship between the black Hollands and the
white Hollands. He also plans to take his genealogical quest to his
ancestors' home tribe, the Ibo farming community in Nigeria.</TE>
<TE>   "People think you're a descendant of a slave," he said. "But who
were you before that?"</TE>

<HD>Overdue Audit Threatens Grambling's Existence</HD>
<DH>Education: Acclaimed black university is two years late
with report that would help it secure re-accreditation. It faces a
Sept. 16 deadline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRETT MARTEL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>GRAMBLING, La.</DL>
<LD>Black and gold banners proclaiming "100 Years of Excellence" remain
on lampposts throughout the Grambling State University campus a year
after the historically black school's centennial.</LD>
<LD>   Such symbols of longevity seem to be needed reassurance at a time
when Grambling is struggling to overcome an episode of accounting
incompetence so drawn out that it threatens to close the school.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes I wake up at night, shaking, wondering, what if?" said
Helen Richards-Smith, dean of the university's honors college and a
Grambling faculty member for most years since she graduated from here
in 1944.</LD>
<TE>   The campus of red bricks and white columns amid the piney hills of
north Louisiana, founded by an association of black farmers in 1901,
has been unable to provide financial statements deemed acceptable for
a state audit since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Such an audit is generally required in three consecutive years for
re-accreditation, a process that occurs every 10 years and is now
about two years past due at Grambling.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Assn. of Colleges and Schools, an Atlanta-based
national accrediting group, has placed Grambling on probation and has
set a Sept. 16 deadline for an approved audit for the past two
academic years.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Aid Threatened</TE>
<TE>   If Grambling loses its accreditation, it will also lose federal
funding, including financial aid for students -- 90% of whom now
receive this aid. If unaccredited, its degrees would lose value with
graduate school admissions offices and professional licensing boards.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be out of business," said Grambling graduate David Wright,
who sits on the Louisiana university system's board of supervisors,
which oversees the school. "All over the country, it would be a
terrific blow because we have a lot of alumni and friends of
Grambling."</TE>
<TE>   Grambling is to black America what Notre Dame is to Roman Catholic
America in the fierce loyalty it inspires among alumni and countless
boosters, including many who've never set foot on campus.</TE>
<TE>   In football, Grambling became synonymous with success under
now-retired coaching icon Eddie Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   The Grambling marching band's high-energy performances have
included Super Bowl halftime shows and inaugurations of African
presidents.</TE>
<TE>   Grambling graduates hold management jobs at companies like Ford,
Gannett, Cisco and Apple.</TE>
<TE>   These accomplishments come despite the fact that many students are
the first in their families to go to college and that many incoming
students need remedial help. There is no minimum admission standard
except a high school diploma.</TE>
<TE>   The school's motto is: "The place where everybody is somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Series of Problems</TE>
<TE>   The accounting mess -- the latest in a series of financial
problems, including thefts and improper spending -- has made it a
place where everybody is anxious.</TE>
<TE>   "None of my friends have left, but we were all talking about it,"
said Tamika Noble, 21, a senior studying sociology. Still, she's
certain the school has much support. "They're not going to let
Grambling close down."</TE>
<TE>   Reshawn Thomas, 20, a senior marketing major and Student
Government Assn. treasurer who comes from a long line of Grambling
graduates, says the looming accreditation question is "everybody's
top concern."</TE>
<TE>   State Legislative Auditor Dan Kyle has doubled the auditing staff
he originally dispatched to help the school meet the deadline: "They
have an enormous task. Whether they can do it I cannot predict," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Describing the bad bookkeeping, Kyle said, "It's like saying for
accounts receivable, 'Several different people owe me $10,000
combined, but I don't know who they are or how much each one owes.' "</TE>
<TE>   Grambling officials acknowledge that the accounting staff in
recent years was undertrained. But the root of the problem, many say,
was instability at the top. After having only three presidents in its
first 90 years, Grambling is on its sixth president since 1991. It
has had seven vice presidents of finance since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Grambling has been "fought over like a fiefdom by politically
connected blacks," said Rick Gallot, a black state representative and
a Grambling graduate.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Mildred Gallot, also a Grambling graduate and longtime
history professor, adds that recent presidents "seemed to have the
attitude: 'I need my people in place -- people loyal to me.' "</TE>
<TE>   One example was Steve Favors, a former Howard University
administrator appointed Grambling's president in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Alienation Reported</TE>
<TE>   Melvin Davis, chief financial officer when Grambling received its
last approved audit in 1997, said he felt alienated by Favors and
took a better-paying job in 1999. Davis said he offered to help
Grambling close its books for 1998 and 1999 anyway, so the school
would be ready for its regularly scheduled re-accreditation in 2000.
He was rebuffed.</TE>
<TE>   Favors hired a new CFO, who backed out before his first day of
work and took a job in Florida instead.</TE>
<TE>   A Grambling spokeswoman said requests for interviews with Favors,
who was forced out as president in January 2001 but remains on the
faculty, had to go through her. The request was made; Favors did not
respond.</TE>
<TE>   After Favors' ouster, the board appointed Neari Warner, a
Grambling insider who was accomplished in academic affairs but lacked
experience with certain administrative and financial matters, as
acting president.</TE>
<TE>   "It made me wonder if they were setting her up for failure," Rep.
Gallot said.</TE>
<TE>   126 Workers Fired</TE>
<TE>   System president Sally Clausen said Warner accepted the job on an
interim basis and so far has shown determination to take tough
measures, including the firing of 126 employees, mostly
administrative.</TE>
<TE>   "The end result is that the legislative auditor now believes the
right people are in place," Clausen said.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Warner brought in Billy Owens, a former top financial
officer with Jesse Jackson's Rainbow / PUSH Coalition, as Grambling's
new CFO, its first since Davis in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   On meeting the deadline, Owens said, "What appeared to many one
year ago as an impossibility now looks like a very real possibility."</TE>
<TE>   Warner also remains positive.</TE>
<TE>   "I see these difficult situations as launching pads to higher
standards of accountability and productivity," Warner said in a
written response to a reporter's questions.</TE>
<TE>   Grambling does not appear to have cash-flow problems, say
officials with the Louisiana Board of Regents, which oversees all
state universities.</TE>
<TE>   Grambling receives about 20% more in state funding per student
than the average for Louisiana's four-year campuses, in part because
of a civil rights settlement that required the state to compensate
for years of spending more on predominantly white than historically
black colleges.</TE>
<TE>   But the current crisis is only the latest in a series of financial
embarrassments since 1993, when Kyle refused to express an opinion on
the accuracy of Grambling's financial statements. And he deemed
Grambling's financial statements unacceptable in 1994. The
accreditation group's warning came a year later.</TE>
<TE>   A 1996 legislative audit reported a variety of irregularities,
including:</TE>
<TE>   * $343,000 in uncollected debts.</TE>
<TE>   * Thefts of computers and air conditioners worth $51,000.</TE>
<TE>   * $10,500 in scholarships given to unqualified high school
graduates.</TE>
<TE>   President Forced Out</TE>
<TE>   Trustees soon forced university President Raymond Hicks to resign.
He left the school with a $3-million deficit, which officials said
was caused largely by overestimating enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   Enrollment dropped sharply -- from 7,833 in fall 1993 to about
4,500 now -- but officials say factors other than financial woes were
the main cause. Most important, they say, were an effort to set
higher admission standards, which have since been dropped, and higher
tuition for out-of-state students, which has been retained.</TE>
<TE>   But revelations of questionable spending have not helped. In the
mid-1990s, Andrea Jefferson, wife of U.S. Rep. William J. Jefferson
(D-La.) was paid $50,000 by Grambling to teach a class in New
Orleans. One student enrolled.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the transfer of public money -- about $1.6 million
-- to the Grambling Foundation, the university's now-bankrupt private
fund-raising arm.</TE>
<TE>   Favors, the former president, has said Grambling trusted that the
money it transferred to the foundation would be spent to benefit the
school, but had no control over it. He blamed problems on a
foundation administrator from 1997 to 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle, the state audit chief, found that money meant for
scholarships was instead spent on administrative costs and the
start-up and operation of a short-lived sports bar. More than $1
million that the foundation received from the annual Bayou Classic
football game went to expenses, such as hotel rooms, receptions and
limousine services.</TE>
<TE>   Grambling's proceeds from the game were transferred to the
foundation, which Kyle concluded had failed to keep credible
financial records and displayed "a lack of integrity." No charges
have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to see Grambling become more accountable," said
Herbert Simmons, director of alumni development. He termed the latest
financial crisis "a wake-up call."</TE>
<TE>   Scholarship Recipient</TE>
<TE>   Simmons' bond to Grambling is strong. Reared by a grandmother who
couldn't read or write, Simmons came to the school on a band
scholarship and went on to become a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of Grambling "would be unthinkable to me," he said. "For
100 years, we've been taking nobodies and turning them into
somebodies.... Where would we be as a nation without Grambling?"</TE>

<HD>Landmark N.Y. Deli Losing Out to Housemate</HD>
<DH>Neighborhoods: Ratner's on the Lower East Side is only open
one day a week while its back room, a retro-style lounge, is open
seven.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LUKAS I. ALPERT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>For years, Jews living on Manhattan's Lower East Side made a regular
pilgrimage to Ratner's for its home-style pirogen, blintzes, gefilte
fish, matzo brie, baskets of freshly baked onion rolls and
notoriously surly wait service.</LD>
<LD>   But the flickering neon sign in front of Ratner's -- a New York
institution offering some of the finest kosher dairy dining anywhere
-- is losing its luster.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Lansky Lounge &amp; Grill, a trendy steakhouse and
martini bar carved out of the back half of Ratner's in 1997, is
burning brighter than ever.</LD>
<TE>   And that could mean the end of Ratner's, a landmark that has been
in place for 84 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, Ratner's is fading away and Lansky's is coming up
in the world," said co-owner Fred Harmatz.</TE>
<TE>   "The way this neighborhood has changed, people who come into
Lansky's now, if you asked them what a bowl of borscht was, they'd
think you were speaking a foreign language."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, faced with a dwindling clientele and construction on
the nearby Williamsburg Bridge spanning the East River between
Manhattan and Brooklyn, Harmatz and his younger brother, Robert,
decided to open Ratner's on Sundays only, while operating Lansky's
seven nights a week.</TE>
<TE>   "The neighborhood changed, but we've tried to keep this going as
long as we can," Robert Harmatz said. "When the lounge started five
years ago, we began rethinking what we were doing here."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the once-heavily Jewish neighborhood of
turn-of-the century tenements and discount storefronts has attracted
art galleries, boutiques -- and eateries such as Lansky's.</TE>
<TE>   But during its heyday from World War II until the early 1970s,
Ratner's was run by the Harmatzes' father, Harold, 24 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd never know if it was 3 in the morning or 3 in the afternoon
here, it was always so busy," Fred Harmatz said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a reputation for its dour waiters, Ratner's was popular
with Nelson Rockefeller, John F. Kennedy and other politicians, who
simultaneously came shopping for the Jewish vote and Ratner's famous
breads, cakes and desserts -- all baked fresh on the premises.</TE>
<TE>   It also became popular with Jewish mobsters like Bugsy Siegel and
Meyer Lansky, for whom Lansky Lounge is named.</TE>
<TE>   "Meyer came in here all the time, and he always sat in the back,"
Fred Harmatz said. "Well, he once said to my father, 'I might be your
best customer. You should name a table after me.' My father did him
one better and named the whole back room after him."</TE>
<TE>   The brothers kept the name when the back room was turned into a
retro-style lounge. And in keeping with the mobster theme, the front
door -- tucked away in an alley -- is outfitted with a
speak-easy-style sliding eye-panel. Jacob Harmatz, the Harmatzes'
grandfather, opened Ratner's with his brother-in-law, Alex Ratner, in
1905, deciding on the name after flipping a coin.</TE>
<TE>   After Ratner sold his share, Jacob moved the restaurant in 1918
from Pitt Street to its current location at 138 Delancey St., where
its vegetarian dairy menu became wildly successful with the area's
overwhelmingly Jewish population.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, their emphasis on healthy, vegetarian food was very
much ahead of its time," said Jenna Weissman Joselit, a professor at
Princeton University and author of several books detailing modern
urban Jewish history.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the neighborhood changed, the Jews moved out or grew
old, and the menu became too much of an anachronism for the new
generation.</TE>
<TE>   "Over time, the culinary preferences of kosher-keeping Jews have
gotten much more ... sophisticated," Joselit said.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Harmatz said the change really started in the 1960s, when
Hispanics and other groups began moving into the neighborhood and
Jews started leaving for the suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s, the migration of new people to the area began
to snowball.</TE>
<TE>   "The demographic of the neighborhood really began to change
dramatically then and suddenly all these businesses that had been
around for 70 or 80 years started going out of business right and
left," said Robin Marcato, community liaison for the Lower East Side
Tenement Museum.</TE>
<TE>   But Ratner's hung on -- barely.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, with the city experiencing a massive increase in the
number of Orthodox Jews, the Harmatzes decided to make the restaurant
strictly kosher. In fact, when Lansky Lounge first opened as just a
bar, it remained closed on Friday nights out of respect for the
Sabbath.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever heard of a bar closed on Friday nights?" Fred asked.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1999, the Harmatzes turned the lounge into a restaurant
offering a non-kosher menu, and that spelled non-kosher for Ratner's
as well since the two shared the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nothing against religion," Fred said. "It was a business
decision."</TE>
<TE>   A decision that drove away the Orthodox crowd, and ultimately may
see Ratner's demise.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers have recently toyed with the idea of selling all or
part of the nearly 15,000-square-foot space that includes Ratner's,
Lansky Lounge, a kosher factory that produces frozen blintzes, potato
pancakes and soups, and three apartments that have been vacant since
1958.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really want to sell," Fred Harmatz said. "But if someone
came along with the right price, I'd have to say we'd consider it."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Ratner's on Sundays still teems with nostalgic Jews
desperate for a taste of marmaliga, a cornmeal cake with cheese, or
hammantashen, a pastry.</TE>
<TE>   "Invariably, it's the lox and onion omelet that always gets me in
here," said Milton Crystal, a lawyer from Syracuse, N.Y.</TE>

<HD>As Vet Bills Grow, Policies Help</HD>
<DH>Health: Americans spend about $11.1 billion on their pets'
medical care each year. But fewer than 1% have insurance to cover
costly and high-tech treatments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARYCLAIRE DALE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Zachary has endured chemotherapy, five hip and knee operations, and
gall bladder surgery.</LD>
<LD>   He takes a daily diet of prescription drugs to combat nausea and
other maladies, and gets intravenous fluids at night because of
kidney failure.</LD>
<LD>   "He's going strong. Last July, you would have never thought he'd
make it a couple more weeks," said Donna Raichle, 54, who spends
about $400 a month on Zachary's care.</LD>
<TE>   Zachary, by the way, is a 12-pound Yorkshire terrier.</TE>
<TE>   His lengthy medical file may be one clue that the era of pet
health insurance has arrived.</TE>
<TE>   With advancements in veterinary care, more pets like Zachary can
get high-tech -- and costly -- treatments ranging from chemotherapy
to behavioral therapy.</TE>
<TE>   And more owners like Raichle are seeking out the insurance that
pays for it.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans are in love with their pets, and ... they're spending
more on them," said Jack Stephens, 55, a California veterinarian who
founded the Veterinary Pet Insurance Co. in Brea in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   After losing $18 million over 20 years, VPI turned its first
profit last year, earning $1.3 million on $47 million in revenues.
The company has 85% of the U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy helps, but what we find is it's really the bond of
the pet with the owner that's driving our business," Stephens said.</TE>
<TE>   He launched the company, with financial backing from 900
veterinarians, after watching people put their pets down for mostly
financial reasons. Stephens knew how to cure the animals, but the
average person's limit for pet care was about $250.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the threshold is $900 and climbing, according to industry
studies. Americans spend about $11.1 billion on veterinary medicine
each year, according to the American Veterinary Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Some people will pay more than others.</TE>
<TE>   One physician couple, whose German pointer was mauled by other
dogs, ran up a $40,000 bill at the University of Pennsylvania's
veterinary hospital. After several surgeries, skin grafts and a
weeks-long stay, the purebred hunting dog is back in action.</TE>
<TE>   Cable TV shows about animals and veterinary care are making people
more aware of the treatments available, according to Dr. Ken Drobatz,
who directs Penn's emergency veterinary service.</TE>
<TE>   But only a small fraction of his customers -- and fewer than 1% of
the nearly 60 million households with pets nationwide -- have pet
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely get clients asking about it all the time. A lot of
time, they're asking after the fact," Drobatz said.</TE>
<TE>   Most insurance companies that have entered the business over the
years have failed, but that may be changing.</TE>
<TE>   VPI expects to take in $72 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Its policies range from $193 per year for standard coverage for a
kitten to a $521 premium policy for a 10-year-old dog.</TE>
<TE>   Raichle had pet insurance years ago for one of her first Yorkies,
but felt that it didn't pay most claims and dropped it.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Marcus, who has also had several Yorkies, won't be without
it. VPI paid about half of the $3,500 to $5,000 in veterinary bills
for her beloved Bandit in the six months before he died at age 15.</TE>
<TE>   "This dog brought us so much pleasure that I would have done
anything that money could have done to try to keep this dog alive,"
said Marcus, 59, who sells real estate on Chicago's Gold Coast.</TE>
<TE>   That philosophy troubles some, including Arthur Caplan, chairman
of Penn's Department of Medical Ethics. He hears from people every
day who don't have health insurance for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of odd to think that a pet could get certain treatments
in the United States that certain people could not afford," Caplan
said.</TE>
<TE>   When his own collie was ill, he explained to his young son that it
would be more humane to let the dog die.</TE>
<TE>   Raichle said she'll know when it's time to let Zachary go.</TE>
<TE>   "Zachary is a kissing machine," she said. "When he stops kissing,
that will be the time to say, 'That's it.' "</TE>

<HD>Children Worldwide Discover That Life Is a Mom-and-Pop
Operation</HD>
<DH>Family: Parental ties--a son or daughter's craving for
approval, even into adulthood--are universal, and stronger than most
people think.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA IRVINE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>RICHMOND, Ind.</DL>
<LD>He is gone, torn from her life by cancer when she was 15 years old.
Seven years later, Connelly Stokes-Prindle still finds herself
longing for her father's advice.</LD>
<LD>   Would he like her boyfriend? What would he say about her decision
to take a break from college?</LD>
<LD>   "I wonder every day what he'd think of my life now," she says.</LD>
<TE>   The strength of the bond, even beyond death, startles her a bit,
as does the approval she still seeks from her mother, who lives 800
miles away.</TE>
<TE>   But that tug--that craving for a parent's approval, even an absent
one--is universal.</TE>
<TE>   Child and family experts see it in their research. Teachers deal
with its effects every day in their classrooms. Therapists work
through it with their patients, often well into adulthood.</TE>
<TE>   It's that lingering pull that gets to Stokes-Prindle. At age 22,
she is independent and, by her own estimation, "a grown-up."</TE>
<TE>   She has a steady income and has worked a few jobs--from substitute
teacher to temporary jobs coordinator--since leaving her religion
studies at nearby Earlham College. She owns an aging but trusty Honda
Civic. She pays her bills and shares the rent on a weathered,
clapboard house, tucked away in a small college and farming town,
roughly midway between Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   And still, when it comes to her mother, "It's impossible to make a
choice and not worry about whether she'll approve or not."</TE>
<TE>   As maddening as that can be, experts say that, even in adulthood,
the bond between a child and parent reaches to the core of who we
are; it molds our sense of self and, at its best, gives us a place to
belong.</TE>
<TE>   Experts also point to countless studies that show quality
child-rearing--developmental psychologist Peter Scales calls it a
combination of "warmth, firmness and democracy"--is closely related
to everything from school readiness to better mental health.</TE>
<TE>   "No other sources of socialization come close to parents in the
breadth and depth of their potential effects on children, both
positive and negative," says Scales, who has compiled results from
scores of studies in his work as a senior fellow at the Search
Institute, a Minneapolis-based youth research center.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many call the relationship with a parent or parent
figure--grandparents, stepparents or any adult who steps in as the
main caregiver--the most important relationship in a child's life.</TE>
<TE>   "What seems to be important is having someone there for you,
someone who is just for you, 100%," says James Garbarino, a professor
of human development at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   For Stokes-Prindle, those someones were the two people who
combined lives and last names to create hers.</TE>
<TE>   Geoffrey Stokes, her father, was a gregarious man with a bushy
beard who wrote for the Village Voice and the Boston Globe, among
other publications. He died in 1995, about a year after being
diagnosed with esophageal cancer. Her mother, Janice Prindle, is a
quiet woman and a writer who teaches high school and lives in
Woodstock, Vt., where the family moved when Stokes-Prindle was 7.</TE>
<TE>   The imprint each left on their eldest of two daughters is obvious.</TE>
<TE>   It can be seen in the almond-shaped, brown eyes that are like her
mother's and the dry wit she shared with her father. It's also plain
that she comes from a literary family: Stacks of books tell of the
"addiction for the printed word" that her parents instilled in her.</TE>
<TE>   "It really does help paint a picture of who I am and where I came
from," she says. "Who my parents were shaped who I am to such an
extent that it's hard to separate who I would've been without them."</TE>
<TE>   Many other young people agree with those thoughts, whether the
relationships with their parents is good or bad.</TE>
<TE>   "If they didn't care about how I was doing," 16-year-old Chito
Trinidad of Chicago says about his parents, "I wouldn't probably care
if I succeeded in life."</TE>
<TE>   Millie Thomas, 21, is a senior at the University of Texas. She
says she has "had friends whose parents have disowned them because of
people they date or decisions they make in their lives. It's very
sad, and it just seems like both the parent and the child suffer."</TE>
<TE>   Psychologist John Mayer says problems with Mom and Dad almost
always eventually surface in therapy sessions with the many troubled
teens who pass through the doors of his Chicago office.</TE>
<TE>   "For well over 90%, parents are the main issue," Mayer says. "Did
the parents cause it? Not necessarily. But either way, they can help
them get out of it. They are my agents of change."</TE>
<TE>   When children do well, parents often get the credit--even from
their children.</TE>
<TE>   But when something goes wrong, parents frequently are the first to
be blamed and, increasingly, are being made to take responsibility
for their children's actions.</TE>
<TE>   In more extreme cases, including the 1999 Columbine High School
massacre in Littleton, Colo., parents have settled million-dollar
lawsuits aimed at holding them accountable for their children's
actions.</TE>
<TE>   But while it might be easy to point fingers, experts say we
shouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at some of these cases and think, 'But for the grace of
God go I,' " says Robert Billingham, an associate professor of human
development and family studies at Indiana University.</TE>
<TE>   Prindle still worries about the time she wasn't able to spend with
her two daughters after her husband died. They were still in
school--and Cecily, her youngest, was only 11. But Prindle had no
choice but to return to work full time to support them.</TE>
<TE>   Then her own father fell ill with Alzheimer's disease.</TE>
<TE>   "At a time when my children were most needy I was less
available--physically and emotionally stressed more than they had
ever known me to be--and I know this deepened their feelings of loss,
and mine," Prindle says. "I still feel terrible about this."</TE>
<TE>   Garbarino says the feeling is often much the same for parents of a
child who commits a heinous crime, despite their best efforts to get
help for that son or daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The professor traveled from Cornell to Colorado to interview the
parents of teen Dylan Klebold, one of the Columbine shooters, and
found the experience "very humbling."</TE>
<TE>   To further complicate matters, experts also say it's not always as
easy as simply looking at how a child is being reared to predict how
he or she will fare in life.</TE>
<TE>   "Some kids seem remarkably resilient," says Nadine Kaslow, a
professor and chief psychologist in the department of psychiatry at
Emory University and Grady Hospital in Atlanta. "And then there are
families where the kid got good parenting and things don't turn out
so well."</TE>
<TE>   There are ways to strengthen the parent-child bond.</TE>
<TE>   Garbarino says children and teens are more likely to open up in a
"you-can-tell-me-anything" relationship.</TE>

<HD>Brickyard 400 Makes Fans' Motors Run</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: Although stock cars are ill-suited for
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, event is Winston Cup's best attended.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ED HINTON</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>A decade ago this summer, Indianapolis Motor Speedway President Tony
George was a man in a quandary over this NASCAR business.</LD>
<LD>   He wasn't sure whether to accept a proposal for the grandest
wedding in modern-day motor sports--of America's most popular form of
racing to America's most-hallowed track.</LD>
<LD>   George feared this would be a Hollywood marriage, glitzy but
brief.</LD>
<TE>   "Those NASCAR fans," he said, "are accustomed to being able to see
all the way around their race tracks."</TE>
<TE>   Indy's mammoth grandstands would be their own obstacle to
continuing sellouts of a NASCAR event, he thought.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I think they'll come to our place once," he said. "But when
they realize they can't see the whole track, they may not come back."</TE>
<TE>   Well, now ... they're back. Again.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300,000 strong, as always.</TE>
<TE>   Today's Brickyard 400 will be the ninth running of the most
immediately and enormously successful event in the history of motor
sports. No other race has become so big so fast.</TE>
<TE>   The fans can't see much, except for hordes of one another. Even if
they could, there wouldn't be much racing--in the NASCAR sense,
door-to-door--to see.</TE>
<TE>   Running big, clumsy stock cars at Indy is like stampeding a herd
of buffalo down a waxed hardwood hallway. They slip, slide and lumber
through the flat, sharp, treacherous turns of an ancient
"oval"--actually a rectangle--built in 1909 for cars that ran 70 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Many generations of Indy cars have evolved, designed specifically
to go fast on the old Speedway, with all other tracks merely
afterthoughts.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR brings its standard equipment. And so primitive cars plus
primitive track configuration add up to dull and tentative racing,
with little passing for the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't matter. Indy is the towering paradox of the Winston Cup
tour--arguably the worst track for NASCAR-style racing but clearly
the best venue. No other Cup race comes close to the Brickyard in
attendance.</TE>
<TE>   And even as the oldest track by far on the tour, Indy is in many
ways the most modern--today's race will be the first Winston Cup
event ever run with life-saving "soft walls," first used for this
year's Indy 500, which George has spent years and millions of dollars
developing.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, the Brickyard 400 is worship, instant tradition,
McReverence, steeped and seasoned and microwaved in the armies of
motor homes that invade central Indiana the first weekend of each
August.</TE>
<TE>   The NASCAR legions have taken racing's most hallowed ground for
their own, all those decades of very different tradition at Indy be
damned--or rather, just ignored.</TE>
<TE>   It all amounts to a phenomenon no one could have forecast. Not
even George, who in 1992, his third year as head of the Speedway, had
such revolutionary ideas for the place that many deemed him either a
dreamer or just not very smart.</TE>
<TE>   The place where he expressed his concerns was in itself telling of
the tradition-shattering options he was weighing. It was in the
paddock at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal, where he was the VIP
guest of yet another suitor of the Speedway, Formula One.</TE>
<TE>   His flirtations with both NASCAR and F1 had outraged purists who
held "The 500-Mile Race," known to the world as the Indy 500, to be
sacrosanct. It must, they felt, be the only event here each year, as
it had been since 1911.</TE>
<TE>   George wasn't bothered by the charges of heresy, bent as he was on
awakening the grand old track from stodgy tradition. From the day in
1990 when he ascended the throne of his grandfather, the late Anton
Hulman, George clearly meant to run Indy as a business, and a growing
one at that.</TE>
<TE>   But on NASCAR, he moved cautiously. The last thing he wanted was a
novelty event that would flash but once, then ebb.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of '92 he agreed to a sort of first date with
NASCAR. It was billed as "a tire test" for Winston Cup cars but
amounted to a dress rehearsal. Everybody who was anybody in NASCAR
came. When they got here, they knelt and bowed and kissed the storied
"yard of bricks" at the start-finish line.</TE>
<TE>   America's race fans took that as the engagement of the titanic
couple, though it was by no means official, and prepared to pounce on
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   All seats were gone within hours after ticket sales opened. Then
the backlog of demand blew out Indy's computerized ticketing system.
All of this occurred in 17 hours.</TE>
<TE>   And the Brickyard 400 has been sold out ever since.</TE>
<TE>   When CART pulled out of the 500 in '96, claiming to take the
"stars and cars" with it, even local sports pundits laughed. The
league with all the stars and cars was NASCAR, and so the 400 leapt
over the 500, at least in the hearts and minds of locals who
preferred the all-American cast to the imported personalities of the
500.</TE>
<TE>   A Brickyard 400 weekend is now what an Indy 500 weekend used to
be--a Woodstock with grandstands. Venture too near the corner of 16th
Street and Georgetown Road by Friday afternoon, and you risk being
hopelessly lost in gridlock, not only of traffic but of pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   Yet anybody in the service industry in Indianapolis will tell you
they'd much rather host the NASCAR crowd--which is much better
behaved--than the rowdy 500 throngs.</TE>
<TE>   This is yet another paradox, for in the 400's beginnings, Indy
officials, fearful of NASCAR fans' reputation for hooliganism in the
South, decided not to open the infield for general admission and RV
parking. They still don't.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, the 400 might easily outdraw the 500, and what is
annually one of the dullest races in NASCAR might become the biggest
race in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The venerable TV racing commentator Chris Economaki, when he was a
track public-address announcer, had his own rule for creating
excitement: "The crowd must never leave having seen a race that was
as good as it thinks it saw."</TE>
<TE>   The Brickyard 400 may be racing's best example of Economaki's Law,
plus a current political catch phrase: Perception is reality.</TE>

<HD>Carter, Crouch on Different Courses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quincy Carter is well aware of the history of Dallas Cowboy
quarterbacks before him: Meredith, Staubach, White and Aikman.</LD>
<LD>   He's ready for his turn.</LD>
<LD>   "I just want to uphold that tradition," Carter said. "I've got a
lot of pressure on myself. That helps keep me going."</LD>
<TE>   For Heisman Trophy winner Eric Crouch of Nebraska, his award is
inconsequential. The former Nebraska quarterback, perhaps the future
X factor in the Rams' offense, now is playing catch-up at a new
position.</TE>
<TE>   Crouch is a wide receiver with zero experience, trying his best to
avoid embarrassment among four-time Pro Bowler Isaac Bruce and Torry
Holt. It's a vastly different atmosphere for Crouch. When he accepted
college football's biggest individual honor last December, he was No.
1. Now he's a remedial athlete.</TE>
<TE>   "You know you're starting from the bottom of the barrel, and
you've got to make your way all the way to the top," Crouch said.
"It's going to be a challenge, and that's one thing I've always
looked at. Every time I step on the field, it's a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Both are trying to adjust to their surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   Carter knows the Cowboy quarterbacks before him established
themselves as leaders, won games and produced championships. In his
second training camp, Carter feels he can make the Cowboys his team
and move in the right direction following two consecutive 5-11
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Carter talks and walks with confidence. There is a calmness about
him, whether facing new offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet, a
blitzing defense or questions about whether he deserves this chance.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Carter was unexpectedly thrust into succeeding
three-time Super Bowl champion Troy Aikman midway through training
camp.</TE>
<TE>   After a shaky camp, Carter missed half of last season because of
thumb and hamstring injuries. He started the last six games, and the
Cowboys went 3-3. His best game was against playoff-bound San
Francisco, when he threw for 241 yards and two touchdowns in a 27-21
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Cowboy owner Jerry Jones has noticed Carter's growth since his
rookie season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like daylight and dark," Jones said. "He's certainly proven
that he knows how to make good decisions."</TE>
<TE>   When the Cowboys signed free-agent quarterback Chad Hutchinson
last winter and gave him a bigger contract than Carter, Jones and
Coach Dave Campo assured Carter he was their starter.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson played four seasons of pro baseball and has not played
football since 1997 at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Carter remained No. 1 during the offseason as the Cowboys learned
Coslet's West Coast-style offense, which features a less-complicated
passing scheme.</TE>
<TE>   There are more short and medium passes, but there also are deep
routes to take advantage of speedsters Joey Galloway and Raghib
Ismail. Emmitt Smith also will have plenty of rushing opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Coslet, who is known for working with young quarterbacks, is
excited about Carter.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't prove himself until we start playing games," Coslet
said. "He proved himself a couple of times last year but had an
injury-plagued season. Let the guy have a chance. He's a good player
and could be a really good one."</TE>
<TE>   Carter can pass and run. He has a strong arm and 4.6 speed over 40
yards.</TE>
<TE>   During the first week of camp, Carter made good throws and was
accurate on several long passes.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows it's his offense," Galloway said. "He steps in knowing,
'OK, I'm the guy, I'm running the show.' We can see that, we can feel
that. It's not like he's a fresh guy coming in trying to lead guys
that don't know him. We feel better about him, and he feels better
about us."</TE>
<TE>   There have been missteps for Crouch, who nursed a hamstring injury
during the Rams' first two minicamps. While he grapples with the
terminology and the route-running during training camp, he sometimes
drops a perfectly thrown pass or watches a punt tumble to the grass.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a challenge for him," Bruce said. "This is a
place to learn, and he's going to take his bumps and bruises. He
can't get disappointed with himself if he doesn't make a good play."</TE>
<TE>   Holt can relate to Crouch. After putting up big numbers as a
receiver at North Carolina State, Holt went sixth overall in the 1999
draft.</TE>
<TE>   When he came into training camp, Holt also felt behind.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to stay patient," Holt said. "When you don't know
everything and you've got guys who are better than you, you kind of
take a step back and stay humble."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams will be patient with their third-round pick, whom Coach
Mike Martz envisions as a receiver, returner and secret weapon.</TE>
<TE>   During his college career, Crouch showed a flair for the dramatic.
His end-zone-to-end-zone dash against Missouri last fall is one of
many standout plays. He used his speed and athleticism to become one
of three major college quarterbacks to run for 3,000 yards and pass
for 4,000 yards in a career.</TE>
<TE>   Crouch is the Rams' fastest player, ahead of running back Trung
Canidate, Bruce and Holt.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the fastest player I've ever been around," Martz said.</TE>
<TE>   Speed aside, learning a new position has been difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of little things you have to pay attention to,"
Crouch said. "I'm getting a lot of advice from the veterans, and I'm
going to be learning every day out there.</TE>
<TE>   "I just have to absorb as much as I possibly can and try to
translate that to the football field."</TE>
<TE>   All those years at quarterback have been an asset. Crouch knows
about each position, and he believes that has helped him learn the
playbook.</TE>
<TE>   Yet sometimes he gets the urge to get behind center Andy McCollum
and start barking signals.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't completely forgotten about quarterback, I have to be
honest," Crouch said. "I still have an itch to pick a ball up and
throw it, but that's something that's just innate for me.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm starting to feel like a receiver more and more every day,
running routes and learning from the veterans, and hopefully one of
these days sometime soon it can just feel natural and look natural
for me."</TE>

<DH>THE OLYMPIC CENTURY: Edited by Christian Kinney, World
Sport Research and Publications: 4,004 pp., $599 (24 volumes)
www.olympiccentury.com</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>Alan Abrahamson is a staff writer for The Times who
covers the Olympics.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You've probably never heard of Sirivanh Ketavong but no matter.
Sirivanh is from Laos, and she's a runner. Not just an
around-the-block track star, but a world-class marathon runner. But
being a runner from a poor country is much different than being a
runner from a rich country, and when Sirivanh was training in
Vientiane for the Sydney Olympics, she ran in the same pair of shoes
she wore during the marathon in the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996,
and this, nearly four years later. When a U.S. aid worker stationed
in Vientiane brought her a new pair, purchased on a weekend trip to
Bangkok, she couldn't believe her luck. "They fit!" she screamed in
delight.</LD>
<LD>   Months later, Sirivanh finished dead last in Sydney, a good hour
and 10 minutes behind the winner. She was disappointed about
finishing so far behind, but she finished the race and gave the
Olympics--in spite of all the stories of scandal, drugs and
corruption--a certain legitimacy. It's easy to scoff at the cliche of
Sirivanh's tale, at the oft-repeated observation that the thing about
the Olympics is not the winning but the taking part, but it's true.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone needs a place to dream," says Frank Shorter, the U.S.
champion who won the marathon in 1972 at the Munich Games. "And for
most people around the world, the Olympics are that place."</LD>
<TE>   This is why the Olympics matter, why two out of every three people
on the planet, more than 3 billion people, watch the opening ceremony
on television, why it is so important to see athletes from around the
world sit together in peace, and imagine, if only for a moment, peace
really is possible.</TE>
<TE>   This promise and potential, the undeniable inspiration of the
Olympic ideal, have been elegantly captured in a recently published
24-volume collection, "The Olympic Century," which traces the history
of the modern Games from 1896 through the present day. In sheer size,
totality, design and cost, "The Olympic Century" is light-years
beyond anything else ever attempted on the subject. Nearly 20 years
in the making, at a cost of $11.5 million, it is a collection that
ought to be in every high school and college library in the country.
Every serious Olympic fan ought to shell out for it, too, if for
principle alone: By creating a history as complete as this, the
editors have done much to ensure that we do not forget athletes such
as Sirivanh and the Olympic ideal.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, much about the Olympic enterprise has fallen far
short of the ideal, and the series does not flinch at capturing such
episodes: the horror of terrorism (Munich, 1972), the drug cheats
(Ben Johnson, Seoul, 1988), the boycotts (Moscow, 1980, and Los
Angeles, 1984) and the corruption (Salt Lake City, 2002), not to
mention the incredible venality of certain Olympic administrators
(Avery Brundage, Munich, 1972, memorably declaring after 11 Israeli
athletes and coaches were slain, "The Games must go on").</TE>
<TE>   The idea of the series, commissioned by the International Olympic
Committee and U.S. Olympic Committee, was to provide a basic
reference about the Games, one that would introduce the modern
Olympic movement to those largely unfamiliar with it even while
serving as a source for those conversant with Olympic lore.</TE>
<TE>   To its credit, the IOC and the USOC stayed out of the reporting
and editing process. Former IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch saw
to it that the book was published; insiders will laugh at the fact
that Andrew Jennings, the British author who broke ground in recent
years writing about corruption within the IOC and a longtime
Samaranch nemesis, is cited as an authoritative source.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the IOC connection, the series was able to publish a
wide range of photographs that document, in a way that words cannot,
the time and place and context of each edition of the Games. The shot
that opens Volume 11, for instance, shows the French team giving a
straight-arm salute to Hitler as it passes his box at the opening
ceremony in Berlin in 1936; there is no consensus among historians
whether this was an Olympic salute or fascist one.</TE>
<TE>   If the Games have not changed history, they have perhaps
accompanied history in a unique way. Here, for instance, is Nelson
Mandela's speech to the South African team before the opening
ceremony at the 1992 Games: "All I want to say is that our presence
here is of great significance which goes beyond the boundaries of
sport. Our country had been isolated for many years, not only in
sports but in other fields as well. We are saying now, 'Let's forget
the past. Let bygones be bygones.' I want to tell you that we respect
you, we are proud of all of you and, above all, we love you."</TE>
<TE>   And here is the 1980 U.S. hockey team, surprise gold medal-winners
after beating the Soviet Union and Finland in the medal round. In a
speech welcoming the young team to Washington, D.C., President Carter
said: "For me, as president of the United States, this is one of the
proudest moments I have ever experienced."</TE>
<TE>   It's folly to pretend that the Games aren't wrapped up in politics
of all sorts. But the reason they endure, the reason the Olympic
ideal carries on, is because of the athletes. To gaze at a photo of
Ethiopia's Deratu Tulu and South Africa's Elana Meyer, for instance,
is to rekindle hope. One is black, the other white; in 1992, Tulu
finished first in the women's 10,000-meter race in Barcelona, Meyer
second; immediately afterward, they embraced; the photo shows them
exhausted, delighted, with arms around each other.</TE>
<TE>   To revisit the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo and relive the
minutes that Christopher Dean and Jayne Torvill danced as one on ice
is to experience once again a performance--set to Ravel's
"Bolero"--that remains one of the most mesmerizing, erotic and
athletic moments in sports.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics often make us consider the capacity of the human
spirit, the ability of the body to rise to the demands of the soul.
Perhaps no one so embodies this as Czech runner Emil Zatopek.</TE>
<TE>   Zatopek, born in 1922, spent World War II, summer and winter,
running through the Moravian forests; under the German occupation,
there had been little else to do. After the war, he was conscripted
into the Czech army; he ran in his army boots. He began to run
insanely long distances in training; he logged miles "with a
single-mindedness that would have impressed a wolverine." In 1952, at
the Helsinki Games, Zatopek won the 5,000-meters, the 10,000 and the
marathon, the first and only time one man has won gold medals in the
three longest Olympic running events.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, he had the audacity to speak out when Soviet tanks
crushed the blossoming Czech democracy movement. He was then made an
exile in his own land, consigned first to manual labor at a uranium
mine, then demoted further and told to drive a truck for the Prague
sanitation department. When democracy returned to what is now the
Czech Republic, Zatopek emerged again as a national hero. He died two
years ago, and among the mourners was Algerian-born Alain Mimoun,
who, running for France, kept getting silver to Zatopek's gold.</TE>
<TE>   At Zatopek's funeral in Prague, Mimoun was clear. "Zatopek," he
said, "was like a brother to me." As all these athletes should be to
all of us.</TE>

<DH>TEACHER: The One Who Made the Difference, By Mark
Edmundson, Random House: 280 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT S. BOYNTON</AU>
<BD>Robert S. Boynton directs the graduate magazine
journalism program at New York University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who opens "Teacher" expecting a sepia-toned tale of
inspiration and uplift, a highbrow version of "Dead Poets Society" or
"Tuesdays With Morrie," will be disappointed. Despite its treacly
subtitle ("The One Who Made the Difference"), Mark Edmundson's memoir
is an unsentimental account of his intellectual awakening in 1969,
the year a freshly minted Harvard graduate named Franklin Lears came
to anarchic Medford High School in Massachusetts to teach philosophy.</LD>
<LD>   Swiftly dispensing with what he dubs the "Mr. Chips-Robin Williams
myth" of the selfless mentor who transforms the lives of a hapless
bunch of kids, Edmundson offers a vivid account of how Lears
influenced a miserable, moody adolescent ("one of the least appealing
figures to have traversed the earth's crust") who was sleepwalking
through his high school years. "Teacher" is the book Holden Caulfield
might one day have written had he successfully completed therapy and
gotten a PhD in English. The literary price Edmundson pays for this
verisimilitude is that he occasionally lapses into the characteristic
excesses of a typical high school student, filling out his relatively
slight story with windy digressions, braggadocio and all-around
goofiness, but this is small.</LD>
<TE>   Although barely mentioned in these pages but explored in an essay
Edmundson wrote for Harper's magazine, "Teacher" was inspired by the
existential midlife crisis he had while teaching at the University of
Virginia. A successful critic and popular lecturer, he came to the
conclusion that although his students considered him an "amiable and
attentive guide," few had been changed by their encounters with him,
whether intellectually, spiritually or morally. In the Harper's
essay, "On the Uses of a Liberal Education as Lite Entertainment for
Bored College Students," he lamented the fact that his students,
though technically accomplished, lacked passion. They were "sweet and
sad, hovering in a nearly suspended animation," he wrote. In
"Teacher," it seems that the situation hasn't gotten any better. "No
one seemed to be home," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Reading "Teacher," I came to understand how Edmundson had been
capable of writing so unsparingly, yet compassionately, about his
shallow, consumerist students in his Harper's essay: Thirty years
earlier, he had himself been within a hair's breadth of becoming a
version of them (although in a much less privileged mode). If
"Teacher" is the story of how one man awoke Edmundson from his
conformist slumber, it is also a call to arms for his students to
rise up and rebel against their culture's genteel embrace.</TE>
<TE>   When we first meet Edmundson, he is "a high school thug" living in
the working-class town of Medford, Mass. "A football player, a
brawler who detested all things intellectual," Edmundson confesses
that he "had never read all the way through a book that was written
for adults and that was not concerned with football." Apart from
playing football (which he isn't that good at), Edmundson and his
knucklehead friends spent a lot of time drinking beer and talking
about the sex they weren't having, biding time until those "in charge
peeled back the lid of our tiny tin box of a school to pluck some for
the factory, some for the office, some for the army, some for booze,
some for dope." When a benevolent guidance counselor suggests he take
a philosophy course with a new teacher, he relents only because "it
seemed an agreeable enough way to waste time." A slight, soft-spoken
man wearing a skinny tie and a baggy, "moth-eaten legacy suit," Lears
couldn't have bore less of a resemblance to central casting's choice
for the "Great Teacher." Edmundson quickly takes his measure and
judges him "absurd, a joke," simply another ineffectual teacher for
the class to torment.</TE>
<TE>   Things get off to a shaky start when Lears has the audacity to
open class with a passage from Nietzsche: "Genuine philosophers,
being of necessity people of tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,
have always found themselves, and had to find themselves, in
contradiction to their today." The words mean nothing to Edmundson
and his classmates beyond providing evidence of Lears' pointy-headed
cluelessness.</TE>
<TE>   The classroom etiquette Lears introduces seems minor by today's
standards, but one must remember how radical such things were in
1969. To combat his students' indifference, Lears rearranges the
chairs into a discussion-friendly oval, occasionally holds class
outside, allows them to grade themselves and brings in Harvard
Students for a Democratic Society activists to "radicalize" the
class. He tosses out the sanctioned reading list and assigns Freud's
"Group Psychology," Camus' "The Stranger," Hesse's "Siddhartha" and
Kesey's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." Things get really weird
when Lears lets on that he doesn't own a television set, and before
long he's playing recordings of "hippie music" (Velvet Underground,
The Incredible String Band) and leading a discussion of the meaning
of the Rolling Stones song "Connection" (" ... I just can't make no
connection / But all I want to do is get back to you").</TE>
<TE>   Like all genuinely transformative experiences, Edmundson's
seduction takes place gradually, without his being fully aware of it.
He and his friends find themselves imitating their teacher's absurd
rhetorical questions ("What do people think?" being the most common
one). Edmundson starts talking about Lears to his father. He begins
to read some of the books Lears mentions. He's hooked. "Somehow he'd
colonized us, gotten inside our heads, and we didn't even realize
it," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   More significant than the books Lears suggests is the simple act
of recognizing Edmundson as an individual. What's more, Lears
actually listens to him. "The experience was of a different order
from anyone else. He wasn't thinking about anything else. He was
completely poised on your thoughts." Anyone who has experienced the
magic of being thoroughly understood by a conversation partner will
recognize the intensity of emotion behind Edmundson's description.
"It was a beautiful drug he dispensed. I had never gotten it before,"
he writes.</TE>
<TE>   Edmundson becomes an obsessive student, reading with the "slightly
cracked ardor" he once reserved for football. He discovers that he
was mistaken in his assumption that "all the volumes on the library
shelf had been written by the MHS teachers or their surrogates," and
that books by iconoclasts such as Ken Kesey and Malcolm X can in fact
help him gather his own inchoate thoughts. Edmundson is enraged when
he realizes how much he's missed. He spends hours in the library,
trying to make up for lost time, even reading two books
simultaneously, "jerking [his] head from one to the other."</TE>
<TE>   But what role, precisely, did Lears play in Edmundson's awakening?
It isn't clear. Like Socrates, Lears is a gadfly; "his method is
irony, questioning, hanging around, and being annoying." It isn't so
much that Lears teaches Edmundson anything in particular as that he
frees him to question his world: the Vietnam War, racism, feminism or
any of the other pressing questions in 1969 America.</TE>
<TE>   Edmundson opens "Teacher" by asking if it is "possible to be moved
by such a person secondhand, to be inspired by someone who did his
work thirty years ago?" Alas, I don't think it is. While Edmundson's
story is thoughtful and well-told, he never portrays Lears as a
full-bodied character, another instance in which "Teacher's"
verisimilitude trumps its dramatic efficacy. Edmundson deliberately
chooses authenticity over cliche ("And this, reader, ought to be the
climax of the book ... raise the music level a little," he teases).
But the fact that Lears fails to become a cinema-ready
"character"--the lifelong mentor, the surrogate father--confirms his
success as a teacher. Edmundson's encounter with this latter-day
Socrates leaves him unencumbered, which is the true sign of
intellectual freedom.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Teacher'</TE>
<TE>   When the clock made its last leap, the minute hand hurdling over
the final numeral between us and freedom, and we all got up to
trundle to the door, I caught the tail end of the two girls'
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Directly in front of me, in unmistakable tones, one turned in the
direction of the other and said, "Isn't Mr. Lears cute?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, he is, he really is."</TE>
<TE>   Lears cute? Lears desirable? How could this be? He was a composite
of many things the girls had agreed, in invisible congresses, it
seemed, to find repulsive. He was a "brain," and no girl at Medford
High could get herself worked up over a brain.... A brain cute?</TE>

<HD>A True Son of San Marino</HD>
<DH>GENERAL PATTON: A Soldier's Life, By Stanley P. Hirshson,
HarperCollins: 826 pp., $34.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH L. GALLOWAY</AU>
<BD>Joseph L. Galloway is the coauthor of "We Were Soldiers
Once and Young" and "Triumph Without Victory: A History of the
Persian Gulf War."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gen. George S. Patton Jr. spent only 391 days in combat during his
entire life. What took Alexander the Great and Napoleon a decade, and
took Lee and Grant at least four years, earning reputations for
military genius, Patton nailed down in a year and a bit. A top
British commander called Patton, quite accurately, "the greatest
master of quick tactical movement that World War II developed."</LD>
<LD>   So clearly able to envision the whole battlefield, so quick to
seize the moment in battle, so vital to victory in time of war, and
so huge an embarrassment most of the rest of the time--these are the
often contradictory qualities of a most complex and remarkable 20th
century figure.</LD>
<LD>   Patton captured the public's imagination like no other top general
in World War II. The press loved him and hated him. He was larger
than life with his ivory-handled revolvers, Cavalry jodhpurs and
lacquered helmets. We may never see his like again, especially in
this time of the savage little wars of peace. Today, the stages are
too small and, curiously, the stars of today's wars are the briefers
on television, not those who pull triggers and command tanks in
battle.</LD>
<TE>   Historians and biographers approach Patton at their own peril.
Just when a historian or biographer thinks he has Patton clearly in
view, that Patton vanishes and another quite different one appears.
Stanley P. Hirshson, the biographer of Brigham Young and Gen. William
T. Sherman, grappled with the Patton personae for 11 years and
churned out more than 800 pages in his quest.</TE>
<TE>   The essence of Patton distilled in "General Patton: A Soldier's
Life" is one of a deeply divided, deeply disturbing figure. The book
is a fuller, more detailed study of Patton than what has come before,
thanks in part to Hirshson's exhaustive research of overlooked,
forgotten archival material and newly available Patton family papers.</TE>
<TE>   Hirshson concludes that there were two Pattons: "One is the Patton
of public renown: poet, intellectual, reincarnationist and farsighted
leader. The other is the Patton of reality: devoted son, materialist,
inspiring but often cold leader, a man of narrow social and political
vision." Or as Col. Roger H. Nye, former head of history at West
Point, wrote of Patton's complex mind: He was at once broad and
narrow, genteel and vulgar, receptive to new military ideas but in
other ways stagnant and even regressive.</TE>
<TE>   If it stopped here, Hirshson's biography would present
characteristics that could apply to many historical figures with vast
ambitions. But Hirshson insinuates into his chronicle a startling
suggestion that Patton, by his "bloodthirsty" speeches to his troops
in World War II, was responsible for three massacres of German POWs
and one slaughter of Italian civilians looting a soap factory in
Sicily. His evidence that Patton is the author of these killings is
thin. Similar incidents happened in other American units not under
Patton's command. Such incidents happen in wartime.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in this biography, the revelations are less titillating
but more fascinating. Hirshson gives a detailed recounting of
Patton's family history and shows how, by blood and marriage, the
Pattons were kin and friend to many of those who settled Southern
California. Patton's great-uncle migrated to California and, by 1866,
was well established as a lawyer in Los Angeles. Patton's Civil
War-widowed grandmother, Sally Taylor Patton, with three children to
support, married her late husband's cousin, who joined her brother's
law firm. Patton's maternal grandfather, Benjamin D. Wilson, arrived
in California in 1841, buying Rancho Jurupa (which covered what is
today Riverside) as well as large tracts in San Marino and Pasadena.
Upon his daughter Ruth's marriage to Sally's eldest son, George, the
newlyweds moved onto the San Marino property where Patton was born in
1885.</TE>
<TE>   It is a little hard to imagine the future warrior enjoying a sunny
California childhood on the sprawling Lake Vineyard Rancho (as it was
called), getting his first horse at 4, his first gun at 5. The young
George was a child of privilege. Summers were spent on Santa
Catalina, riding, fishing and sailing. In his teens, George's eye was
caught by Beatrice Banning Ayer, the daughter of a relative by
marriage. In due course, young Patton married her and made her
Massachusetts home his own.</TE>
<TE>   Both Patton's and his wife's families would leave fortunes that
enabled them to have a lifestyle far above that afforded by a
military man's salary. It is also the Ayer family--mill owners during
the bitter Lawrence, Mass. strikes of 1912--whom Hirshson blames for
Patton, the son of a Populist Democrat, descending into a lifelong
hatred not only of organized labor but also of people of Jewish and
Italian descent.</TE>
<TE>   Hirshson's telling of Patton's early years, while more detailed
than other studies, breaks little new ground. He highlights familiar
milestones: Patton's graduation, by the skin of his teeth, from West
Point in 1909; his competing in the Olympics in 1912 in the modern
pentathlon, finishing fifth. But Hirshson also shows the special
relationships that Patton had with top U.S. military leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In 1915, with war breaking out in Europe, Patton was posted to Ft.
Bliss, Texas. It was the back of beyond. But the commanding officer
was Brig. Gen. John J. Pershing, who, with Mexican revolutionary
Pancho Villa causing problems, mounted an expedition into Mexico.
Patton was chosen as one of Pershing's aides. Sent out to forage for
food, he surprised Villa's chief bodyguard and three other armed men,
killing them and bringing them back to camp strapped across the hood
of his car.</TE>
<TE>   It was Patton's first taste of combat and his first taste of
notoriety. Pershing liked him, promoted him and later chose him to
join the first American unit sailing for France in the spring of
1917. Patton asked to be posted to command the new light tanks, of
which the U.S. Army had none at the time: His 195 volunteers
practiced tank warfare with their only vehicle, a broken-down truck.</TE>
<TE>   Promotion, Hirshson relates, came rapid-fire. Within a week of
being notified that he was promoted to major, Patton was promoted
again to lieutenant colonel. Patton's 304th Tank Brigade went into
action Sept. 12, 1918, in a driving rain near St.-Mihiel. Fuel
shortages plagued the American tanks. During the fighting, Patton was
all over the battlefield, defying an order to remain in his command
post. One of his officers said: "George Patton was always there on
the front lines, never in the rear with the Red Cross. That was one
of the secrets to his greatness." At the Meuse-Argonne, Patton was
shot by the enemy as he led an infantry charge up a hill. While in
the hospital he was promoted to a full colonel's rank. He was not yet
33 and received the Distinguished Service Cross for his heroism.</TE>
<TE>   Upon his return to the U.S., posted to Camp Meade, Md., Patton was
joined by Lt. Col. Dwight D. Eisenhower, another early proponent of
the tanks. Both watched as Congress slashed away at military strength
and budgets. Patton hated peacetime. "One year ago today we were in
the battle of St.-Mihiel and having a fine time," he wrote his
father. "Now I am in the dust and have hay fever and a hell of a
time." Besides the endless socializing and the polo ponies that he
enjoyed, Patton read books on military history and the lives of great
commanders.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it was then that he began to fear he'd never have a chance
to test his mettle in a great cause. Still, Hirshson shows, Patton
believed in his destiny. In 1922 he wrote a poem titled "Through a
Glass, Darkly," in which he depicted his previous existences as a
soldier: "a Greek opposing the Persian king Cyrus; a soldier in a
Roman legion; an Englishman fighting the French at Crecy in 1346; a
cavalryman with Napoleon's marshal, Joachim Murat; and finally a
tanker in the Great War."</TE>
<TE>   Patton's father, before his death in 1927, told his son that an
invisible hand was guiding him, preparing him for something special.
That "something special," Patton believed, would be the greatest war
in history. But by the mid-1930s, nearing the age of 50, Patton still
waited. He made a round of assignments to Cavalry posts. Commanding
Ft. Meyer's largely ceremonial 3rd Cavalry Regiment, he did his best
to cultivate the new Army chief of staff, Gen. George C. Marshall,
socially. It didn't work. The general's wife, Katherine, called
George down for his filthy language at her dinner table.</TE>
<TE>   The partying and the polo were about to end, however. The world
was about to change forever, and so was the sleepy peacetime Army
where Cavalry still meant horses.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 1940, Patton was ordered to Ft. Benning, Ga., to
take command of the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Armored Division. He was back to
the tanks for good. He stepped up his studies. A month later, Patton
got his first star as a brigadier general. Two months later, he was
given command of the 2nd Armored Division. Though his commanding
officers thought of tanks as foxholes on wheels, moving at the
walking speed of an infantry division, Patton knew they had to move
swiftly and strike deeply into the enemy's rear. "Hold them by the
nose and kick them in the ass," was Patton's motto.</TE>
<TE>   Patton pushed his soldiers harder than anyone. "Hard in maneuvers,
easy in war," he said. With America thrown into World War II by
Japan's attacks on Pearl Harbor, the Army expanded its tank forces to
two corps of three armored divisions each. I Corps was commanded by
Patton. Time magazine described him as "tough, profane, gimlet-eyed."
By the summer of 1942, Marshall sent Eisenhower to London as
commander of the European Theater. Patton was tapped to help plan the
invasion of North Africa, Operation Torch, and command a part of it.</TE>
<TE>   Success was anything but assured in the landings on the Moroccan
coast, but, as Hirshson describes, Patton took Casablanca three days
after landing. Elsewhere in North Africa, the British and Americans
had it much rougher. After the debacle at Kasserine Pass, Eisenhower
sent Patton to replace the commander there. Unlike that general,
Patton was everywhere it was dangerous. And along with the new job
came a third star.</TE>
<TE>   Thus was born, by the war's end, the legend of "Old Blood and
Guts" Patton. He was 60 and had feared he would never get the chance
he had studied and trained and lived for: to command men and machines
in a great war.</TE>
<TE>   In Sicily, of course, he blotted his legend when he slapped the
faces of two GIs sent to hospitals with shell shock. As a result he
was sidelined in England and denied all but a supporting diversionary
role in the D-Day landings. In time, however, his old friend
Eisenhower gave him the 3rd Army and turned him loose on the Germans.
Patton would then be Patton, breaking through the German lines and
sending his tanks dashing 20, 30, even 40 miles a day until they ran
dry of fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Even as his forces smashed the last of the German lines, deep
inside the Fatherland, Patton looked at the approaching Soviet armies
and suggested that he should be given new orders to take Moscow. He
would not die gloriously in war, but tragically after a car crash in
1945, after being relieved of command again for failure to clean the
Nazis out of the Bavarian postwar administration he oversaw.</TE>
<TE>   The legend, however, would outlive the man, and his name would
become synonymous with dash and daring. Even Patton himself could not
have hoped for a better ending.</TE>

<DH>THE MAN WHO RODE AMPERSAND, A Novel, By Ferdinand Mount,
Carroll &amp; Graf: 256 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ampersand is a racehorse, the best in the world. Riding him, as
English amateur jockey Harry Cotton discovers between the two world
wars, is "once, just once, perfection. Like sitting in an armchair,
the trainer said. That, yes, but much more, almost as if sitting in
an armchair was the best sensation the human body could ever know,
shriveling to nothing the pleasures of love and wine."</LD>
<LD>   Cotton doesn't ride Ampersand in a race. The horse's obese,
tyrannical owner, known by her initials, C.L., has wearied of her
regular jockey and decided to give Cotton a chance at the Gold Cup,
but just as quickly she changes her mind, yanking him out of the
saddle after a steeplechase warmup.</LD>
<LD>   He is left with that fleeting moment of perfection in an otherwise
haphazard life.</LD>
<TE>   Cotton goes on to other things. Before World War II, he follows a
lover, a Jewish woman, to Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland), and
witnesses the rise of anti-Semitism. During the war, he joins the
special forces and participates in a successful raid against the
Italians in North Africa, in which his closest army friend is killed.
Invalided out of the service, he becomes a British government agent
recruiting workers in neutral Ireland. He marries and has a son,
Aldous, and is devastated by his wife's untimely death.</TE>
<TE>   Still, all this heavier material, which would rise to the top in
the ordinary historical saga, sinks to the bottom in the first novel
in Ferdinand Mount's "A Chronicle of Modern Twilight" series. Mount,
the editor of the Times (of London) Literary Supplement, writes in a
comic vein that runs straight from Charles Dickens through Evelyn
Waugh. Serious things aren't ignored, but they are allowed to find
their natural place--and gravity, in this case, works in laughter's
favor.</TE>
<TE>   "The Man Who Rode Ampersand"--particularly the third-person part
from Cotton's point of view--consists of conversational riffs that
imprint characters on our minds so vividly that further development
or action proves unnecessary. They appear--C.L. and fellow jockey
"Froggy" O'Neill and slimy bookie Cod Chamberlayne and rising
politician Boy Kingsmill and whiskey-soaked philosopher Tom Dunbabin,
whom the unhorsed Cotton meets while bartending at a Soho watering
hole and brothel called the Pyjama Club--they speak, and we remember
them, whether or not they return to speak again.</TE>
<TE>   The banner of seriousness is upheld, somewhat shakily, in a
first-person narrative by Aldous, whose sexual and bureaucratic
misadventures are described in a later novel in the series, the
Booker Prize nominee "Fairness." Aldous is a clumsy, asthmatic boy
who sees Cotton as "all exuberance and will." He loves and resents
his father and tries, with only partial success, to find something in
the man he can respect.</TE>
<TE>   Cotton, we know from the third-person narrative, is an
intellectual lightweight. He never completes a proposed biography of
an ancestor who helped Isaak Walton write "The Compleat Angler." He
drinks and gambles. Much of his undercover work in Ireland involves
standing rounds in pubs. A small trust fund enables him to live
without ever having a regular job. "He admired hard work and quiet,
diligent people," Aldous says. "He just did not fully understand what
they were up to." His biggest decision, to marry, seems to take no
more thought than a wager on a horse.</TE>
<TE>   Aldous makes much of his father's combat experience. "It is too
easy to imagine that the war came just in time to give meaning to the
lives of a generation of misfits," he says, but this seems precisely
the argument he is making for Cotton. Cotton himself might demur. The
North Africa raid is over and done with in a couple of pages, no more
space than is devoted to one of Dunbabin's drunken, hilarious
monologues or to the ride on Ampersand.</TE>
<TE>   The importance Cotton gives that ride--the chief anxiety of his
old age is Froggy's insinuation that he made the story up--is a sign
of superficiality, to be sure. It's related to his halfhearted
pursuit of the Jewish lover, Stella, whom he leaves in Eastern
Europe, and to his benign neglect of young Aldous. But if Cotton
isn't a particularly good man, neither is he a bad one. His life, in
an age of heroes and monsters, is lived on a human scale. He likes
people and has fun. That he did "once, just once" brush perfection
is, Mount would have us believe, not inconsequential.</TE>

<HD>The Extraordinary Life and Writing of Indonesia's Tolstoy</HD>
<DH>THE GIRL FROM THE COAST: A Novel By Pramoedya Ananta Toer,
Translated from the Indonesian by Willem Samuels, Hyperion East: 282
pp., $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMIE JAMES</AU>
<BD>Jamie James is the author of "Andrew and Joey: A Novel"
and lives in Indonesia.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven years ago, I made one of the great discoveries in my life as a
reader when a friend pressed into my hands a copy of "This Earth of
Mankind," by Pramoedya Ananta Toer, the first volume of what has come
to be called the Buru Quartet. Pramoedya is one of those rare writers
whose stature the reader perceives at once, from afar, like a tower.
The Buru books, set amid the emergence of modern Indonesia, struck me
then as one of the most ambitious undertakings in postwar world
literature, and time has only heightened my admiration for this great
literary artist. The Buru novels are Tolstoyan in humanism and scope,
and reminiscent of Conrad in their philosophical profundity and
exquisite tonal articulacy; they are also gripping narratives (the
first two volumes, anyway; their impact diminishes in the later
volumes). Yet as great as these dramas are, they are overshadowed by
the author's own life story.</LD>
<TE>   A survivor of the Japanese occupation during World War II, a
soldier in the Indonesian Revolution, a political prisoner of the
Suharto regime for 14 years, Pramoedya is one of the 20th century's
great voices of conscience. Pram, as he is affectionately known in
Indonesia, wrote most of his best books in durance. His first novel,
"The Fugitive," a dark morality tale about an Indonesian patriot who
is betrayed by his lover's father, was written while he was
imprisoned by Dutch colonial authorities for possession of
nationalist documents. Written when Pramoedya was just 22 years old,
"The Fugitive" was one of the first accomplished works of literature
written in modern Indonesian.</TE>
<TE>   This new translation of "The Girl From the Coast," a novel written
and first published (in serial form in a newspaper) in 1965, is a
major contribution to the growing body of Pramoedya's works in
English. It was written while Pramoedya was at the height of his
creative powers, a commanding intellectual figure in the twilight
years of the regime of Sukarno, Indonesia's founding ruler. Set on
the north coast of Java at the end of the 19th century, the novel is
a sort of pre-autobiography, telling the story of Pramoedya's
grandmother. A nameless 14-year-old girl is forced by her parents
into an arranged marriage with a rich aristocrat, known as the
Bendoro. A simple fisherman's daughter, she overnight becomes the
lady of her husband's household. After she adjusts to her new life,
she becomes pregnant, only to discover that she is a "practice wife"
who will be not only discarded by the Bendoro but separated from the
child she is carrying.</TE>
<TE>   It is a classic tragedy, enacted with tremendous, restrained
gravity, in Willem Samuels' polished, lucid translation. Pramoedya
achieves his most devastating effects by discreet, elliptical
indirection, a defining Javanese trait. The book's first moment of
drama comes soon after the girl's arrival in the city, when the
Bendoro's representative comes to claim her for his employer. He asks
her parents whether she has begun to menstruate, the sole requirement
for a girl to be married in feudal Java. Her mother asks her, and
when it's clear that the child doesn't know what she's talking about,
the mother takes her aside:</TE>
<TE>   "The girl's mother whispered something, but all the girl could do
was shake her head and stare. The mother frowned and shook her head
as well. She then turned and looked at her husband, giving him a
despondent stare. She left her daughter and went to her husband:
'Just tell him yes,' she said." Thus was the 14-year-old prepubescent
virgin prepared for her wedding night.</TE>
<TE>   What gives the novel much of its power, what makes it typically
Pramoedyan, is that while it pulses with an angry moral indignation
that flirts with melodrama--and sometimes crosses the line, as when
the Bendoro strikes the girl with his cane when she tries to kidnap
her own baby--Pramoedya's moral universe is complex and ambiguous.
Through most of their false marriage, the Bendoro treats the girl
kindly; it is her own family who betrayed her.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Pramoedya enjoys the status of an icon in Indonesia,
especially among the nation's younger generation, who treat him as he
deserves, as a national treasure. Yet at the time he wrote "The Girl
From the Coast," he was a contentious, controversial firebrand. He
was a member of Lekra, the Institute for People's Culture, which was
closely affiliated with the Indonesian Communist Party (like Sukarno,
he toyed with communism but never committed to it). Pramoedya became
one of Indonesia's most powerful writers, frequently contributing to
Lentera (the Lantern), the culture page of Bintang Timur, an
influential left-wing newspaper sponsored by Sukarno's party.
Although he was a stout supporter of "the Great Leader of the
Revolution," Pramoedya was always an independent thinker: Indeed, he
served a short prison sentence in 1960 for criticizing the
government's treatment of the Chinese minority.</TE>
<TE>   Pramoedya made enemies while he was the editor of Lentera. In
1963, a group of dissident writers published a manifesto opposing the
Sukarno government; Pram and other left-wing intellectuals attacked
them for being unwitting tools of the army, warning that a bloodbath
would result if the military took power, a prediction that proved to
be deadly accurate. When an obscure general named Suharto seized
control of the government two years later, bringing down the Sukarno
regime, hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered, their
hacked-up corpses littering fields and waterways. In the months and
years that followed, about 1.5 million people were arrested and
detained. Pramoedya was one of them, sent to a penal colony in the
Moluccas, on the island of Buru, giving his most famous books their
byname.</TE>
<TE>   He chronicled his experiences at Buru in "The Mute's Soliloquy," a
memoir first published in an English translation, also by Samuels, in
1999. It is one of the most remarkable documents in modern world
literature, a rambling collection of miscellaneous reminiscences,
some of the most moving written in the form of letters, never sent,
to his children. It was at Buru that he composed under conditions of
almost unimaginable adversity "This Earth of Mankind" and its
successor, "Child of All Nations." I say "composed" rather than
"wrote" because Pramoedya was denied the use of pen and paper, and
created his novel orally, by telling the story to his fellow
prisoners, who helped him to remember the text, in a manner
reminiscent of the bookish outlaws in "Fahrenheit 451."</TE>
<TE>   Even after he was finally released from Buru, in 1979, Pramoedya
was persecuted by the Suharto government: He was not permitted to
travel outside Jakarta, and his books were banned. And his old
enemies from his Lentera days, now in official favor, railed away at
him. In 1995, when Pramoedya won the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay
Award, the top literary honor in Asia, his most outspoken opponent,
the novelist and journalist Mochtar Lubis, protested by returning the
Magsaysay medal he himself had previously won. Pram, of course,
wasn't allowed to attend the ceremonies in Manila, so his wife,
Maemunah Thamrin, went in his place.</TE>
<TE>   Since the decline and fall of the Suharto regime, there has been a
gradual process of reconciliation going on in Indonesia. One of the
signatories of the now-famous 1963 manifesto Goenawan Mohamad, the
former editor of the influential newsweekly magazine Tempo (which was
banned by the Suharto regime in the late '90s) has refused to join
Lubis in condemning Pramoedya, calling it "morally and politically
unacceptable." Lubis, for his part, now suffers from Alzheimer's and
will never have the opportunity to reconsider his attacks on
Pramoedya.</TE>
<TE>   As one might expect, Pramoedya's name is perennially bandied about
by handicappers of the Nobel Prize. It is one of the paradoxes of
contemporary intellectual life that the literature prize grows in
influence in literary circles even as the committee appears to give
less weight to artistic criteria than to political ones. One might
have thought that Pramoedya, a victim of political persecution as
well as a writer of undoubted greatness, would capture their
attention, but thus far the Swedes have ignored Southeast Asia.
Pramoedya doesn't help himself by being honest, as always, when he
admits in interviews with foreign journalists that he is flattered at
being considered for the prize, rather than playing the game of those
who actively campaign for it behind the scenes while publicly
feigning indifference.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in Indonesian literary circles, Pram's preeminence is now
unquestioned. His works are being reissued in Indonesian by Hasta
Mitra Publishing House under the supervision of his longtime editor
and champion, Joesoef Isak, with funding from an American foundation.
The U.S. Library of Congress has archived and documented his entire
collection of manuscripts for safekeeping, a rare honor.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when then-President Abdurrahman Wahid, popularly known
as Gus Dur, was weighing whether to succumb to political pressure and
resign from office, he made the pilgrimage to Pramoedya's home, in
the countryside near Jakarta, to seek his advice. In his memoirs, Gus
Dur's widely respected spokesman, Wimar Witoelar, described the visit
as a tribute to a "cultural icon who had suffered so much with such
elegance, emerging now to take his rightful place as a defining
symbol of Indonesia's resilience."</TE>

<DH>ALCATRAZ SCREW: My Years as a Guard in America's Most
Notorious Prison By George H. Gregory University of Missouri Press:
252 pp., $19.95 paper HEART OF THE ROCK: The Indian Invasion of
Alcatraz By Adam Fortunate Eagle with Tim Findley University of
Oklahoma Press: 232 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of "The Woman Who Laughed at God: The Untold
History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alcatraz is a deeply familiar place, virtually an icon of popular
culture, but everything we think we know about "America's Devil's
Island" is based on what we've seen at the movies.</LD>
<LD>   "Few subjects have been the focus of more disinformation than the
former U.S. penitentiary at Alcatraz," insists National Park Service
archivist John W. Roberts in his introduction to George H. Gregory's
"Alcatraz Screw." "The Rock remains as elusive as it was during
Alcatraz's scant 29 years as a federal prison."</LD>
<LD>   Gregory, however, was an eyewitness to what actually happened on
"the Rock" during the last 15 years of its existence as a federal
prison. He tells his story with intimacy, candor and a hard-boiled
sense of humor in "Alcatraz Screw," a posthumously published memoir
that shows us what Alcatraz looked like to one of its veteran prison
guards.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Gregory's life story reads like the scenario of a film
noir from the 1940s--he started working as a prison guard during the
Depression, turned down a deferment and enlisted in the Marine Corps
during World War II, sustained a serious wound from sniper fire
during the landing on Iwo Jima and returned to his career as a
correctional officer after the war. He was transferred to Alcatraz in
1947, and he continued to serve there until 1962, shortly before the
prison was shut down.</TE>
<TE>   Alcatraz, as Gregory allows us to see, was always a treacherous
and perilous place. On his very first day on the job, for example, he
came to the rescue of a fellow guard who was scuffling with a
prisoner in one of the cells: "It appeared that the convict was
trying to stick the officer's head down the toilet," the author wryly
notes, "and was having some success."</TE>
<TE>   "Alcatraz Screw" is an insider's tale, full of the politics and
pettiness of prison life, the general tedium and the occasional
terror, the lively trade in sex, drugs and alcohol, the constant
tension that sometimes spurred a convict into an act of violence.
Gregory quickly acquired a reputation as an especially tough
"screw"--"One-Man Goon Squad" was his nickname--but he allows us to
understand that guards always felt themselves to be at risk of life
and limb in what was advertised as a maximum-security prison.</TE>
<TE>   "You learned to walk wide around the corner of a cellblock,"
Gregory observes. "Someone not exactly interested in your good health
could be waiting for you around the corner."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory introduces us to a few of the more notorious inmates of
the famous prison, none of whom he finds very impressive. "See that
fellow? Machine Gun Kelly," says one of his fellow guards. "J. Edgar
Hoover says he is a very dangerous criminal."</TE>
<TE>   But the words are strictly ironic, as Gregory explains:
"Translated, that seemed to mean Machine Gun Kelly was not all that
dangerous. He had the stately and distinguished bearing of a
successful banker."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Stroud, the celebrated "Birdman of Alcatraz," is similarly
debunked.</TE>
<TE>   "His involvement with birds was a ruse to get alcohol," Gregory
insists. "He claimed he needed the alcohol to make slides of bird
tissues. Officers who had the opportunity to know say that he drank
the alcohol and that they never saw a sick bird become healthy as a
result of Stroud's treatments."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory delights in revealing the craft and cunning of the
convicts whom he guarded. Ginger filched from the prison kitchen
could be snorted as an intoxicant; bread or fruit could be brewed up
into the prison moonshine known as "pruno." But the greatest
inventiveness was applied to the making of weapons:</TE>
<TE>   "A Molotov cocktail could be made by stuffing the heads of matches
in a small glass bottle and inserting a piece of cotton for a fuse,"
he explains. "Stout string coated with resin or pieces of sandpaper
could be used to cut bars. Anything that was rigid enough to
penetrate human skin and tissue could be made into a shiv."</TE>
<TE>   Much of what Gregory shows us in "Alcatraz Screw" is perfectly
consistent with the movie version of the Rock. Now and then, however,
he reveals a scene that has never been depicted on the silver
screen--the brutal way that the guards dealt with a prisoner on a
hunger strike, for example, an act so revolting that it can readily
be described as torture. At its best moments, Gregory tells us
stories that are strange, shocking and yet somehow charming.</TE>
<TE>   One inmate whose nickname was "Suitcase Sally," for instance, was
caught with a stash of contraband, including a pair of panties
belonging to the warden's wife, a prize that the con had filched from
the prison laundry and hidden away in his cell.</TE>
<TE>   "Where did you get those puce panties?" demands Gregory.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Gregory, those are pink," retorts the inmate, "they're not
puce."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory is baffled when the warden reprimands him for searching
the cell where the panties were found: "A man's cell is his home,"
says the warden. Later, Gregory discovers that Suitcase Sally had
earned the warden's gratitude when he found and turned in a weapon
that had somehow been smuggled into the prison. "A fully loaded .38
could have made widows of six officers' wives and left their children
without fathers," Gregory concludes. "[T]he warden's wife's panties
seemed a small price to pay."</TE>
<TE>   Long before Alcatraz was the site of a prison, it belonged to the
Native Americans known as the Coastanoan people. And when the last
prisoner was taken off Alcatraz in 1963, a group of Native American
activists declared the island to be their own once again.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," said the caretaker who found himself face to face with the
first party of Native Americans who landed on the island in 1964, "I
guess if you want it, you can have it."</TE>
<TE>   Thus began the "invasion" of Alcatraz, a saga that is recounted in
"Heart of the Rock" by activist Adam Fortunate Eagle (formerly known
as Adam Nordwall), in collaboration with journalist Tim Findley. The
first landing party quickly retreated, turning instead to the courts
to press their claim, but returned in force several years later,
during an era when San Francisco and environs were ground zero of the
counterculture, the antiwar movement and various other manifestations
of the New Left, including a restive Indian community that called
itself "the Little Res."</TE>
<TE>   "Searching for a focus, looking in our way for something that
might give us the kind of identity that was so insistently obvious
among blacks and students," writes Fortunate Eagle, "we were
frequently drawn ... to the unresolved issue of Alcatraz."</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 9, 1969, a tiny flotilla embarked from Sausalito and
headed for Alcatraz, where 92 men, women and children would, in the
weeks after, come ashore. This time, the Native Americans stayed for
about two years, taking up residence in the very place where men like
George H. Gregory once lived, turning it into a kind of pilgrimage
site for Native Americans and their supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "The old Devil's Island symbolism of the sinister cell block was
in contrast to the simple but still more comfortable construction of
the apartment house for guards," recalls Fortunate Eagle. "It became,
as intended, a communal center for the families on the island."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually the Indians decided to end their occupation of
Alcatraz, but Fortunate Eagle and his collaborator, both of whom
participated in the invasion, insist that their exploits changed the
way America looked upon Indians and the way Indians looked upon
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Taking back a bitter symbol of repression and punishment for
which the United States had no further use was not only appropriate,
it was outright daring and inspiring," writes Fortunate Eagle. "The
taking of Alcatraz, the brash and bold action of young people
themselves who were willing to go beyond mere theory and debate,
riveted the attention of the public--and rallied support for its
still unclear but obviously promising implications about the future."</TE>

<DH>PASSING: A Novel, By Nella Larsen, The Modern Library: 208
pp. $9.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BROOKE KROEGER</AU>
<BD>Brooke Kroeger is writing a book about present-day
passing for PublicAffairs and is the biographer of Nellie Bly and
Fannie Hurst. She teaches journalism at New York University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Passing," as Nella Larsen explains, is "this breaking away from all
that was familiar and friendly to take one's chance in another
environment, not entirely strange, perhaps, but certainly not
entirely friendly."</LD>
<LD>   It is also the title of her novel about the struggle of Irene
Redfield, a privileged black woman, with the attempts of a childhood
acquaintance to insinuate herself into Irene's adult life. Clare
Kendry was steely, the daughter of a well-liked but drunken mulatto
janitor and a black mother who died when she was small. In womanhood,
Clare has become glamorous, wealthy--and white.</LD>
<LD>   With her "ivory skin" and "pale gold hair," Clare passes for the
same reasons people still decide to pass: for opportunity, for
adventure, for safety or for some combination of the three. At the
time of her father's death, her two (white) great-aunts insist upon
it as they take her in as ward and housemaid. But she does not pass
"all the way," as the expression goes, until she elopes with John
"Jack" Bellew, a white, wealthy and virulent racist, whom she never
tells that she is three-quarters black.</LD>
<TE>   Larsen supplies fresh ironies and subtle twists to what might at
first seem to be another dated "Alas! The poor mulatto!" tale. And
The Modern Library's decision to reissue this 1929 work, now in
paperback, provides a perfect opportunity to rethink the implications
of a practice deployed as often today as it ever was, full-time,
part-time, inadvertently or only-now-and-then. Passing happens in a
range of situations beyond the classic black-for-white in which
Larsen sets her story.</TE>
<TE>   Itinerant passing, for convenience, access or entry, is one of
Larsen's themes. Take an innocuous present-day example: the nobody
with nerve who makes restaurant reservations in the name of someone
with sure-fire cachet. In Larsen's story, the "olive-skinned" Irene
slips into the dining room of a segregated hotel because a cabbie
tells her it is the best place in Chicago for a cool drink on a hot
day. Despite the "race loyalty" Irene both professes and lives, she
also has no compunction about supporting a racist system in this way.</TE>
<TE>   Looking beyond Larsen's definition, we might ask if Irene is also
passing when she postures as the "New Negro" paragon--doctor's wife,
mother, social do-gooder--even though she long ago spent her passion
for these roles and cares only about maintaining her comfort level
and position. Is it passing when Irene's husband, Brian, presents
himself as a dedicated Harlem physician and community stalwart while
he burns to leave New York and bring up his sons in more tolerant
Brazil? And what of this still familiar story: Brian, passing as
attentive, faithful husband, even as he strays.</TE>
<TE>   Clare shifts from full-time to part-time passer well into her life
as a white person: The chance meeting with Irene triggers a yearning
to reassociate with her root community. The year is 1927, after all,
and Harlem is all the rage.</TE>
<TE>   Jack, Clare's husband, is gruff and common, clearly the class
inferior of the sophisticated, well-spoken Harlem crowd to which the
author introduces us. For Clare, enduring this vulgarian's racial
hostility is the price of economic security and social standing. "No
niggers in my family. Never have been and never will be," he bellows
in front of Irene and another white-looking black friend who mask
their indignation with pleasantries and laughter. For Clare's sake,
they feel compelled to pass in his presence.</TE>
<TE>   Clare makes brazen if passive strikes back at Jack's verbal
assaults. There are her almost taunting, repeated forays into Harlem,
and, before them, the more "hellish" act of risking childbirth,
knowing the baby's appearance could well have meant her downfall.</TE>
<TE>   Larsen herself was such a child and became estranged from her own
mixed family (her mother was of Danish origin; her father, West
Indian) when it opted for whiteness. There is a telling entry under
her name in the Harry Ransom Center's repository of copyright
information: "Larsen had no children, left no identification of her
extended family, and her only sibling, now deceased, denied knowledge
of her existence."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1891, Larsen worked as a nurse and then a librarian in
Harlem, where she became a member of its Renaissance literati. But
she abruptly stopped writing in 1930 and resumed her nursing career.
She died in 1964. Her work, which had fallen into obscurity, was
first reclaimed in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   For Clare, as for many passers, the act eliminates deterrents to
economic and social advancement, but passing can also be a means of
avoiding harassment. In all cases, the passer knows or at least
suspects that the group to which he or she seeks admittance or
acceptance is either overtly or covertly intent on keeping the passer
out.</TE>
<TE>   At its most extreme, passing makes it possible to elude treachery
or danger and can open the escape route to survival. Once out of
harm's way, passers often elect to stay with the new program,
inevitably creating identity crises when the coming generations
happen on their history. "I think that being a mother is the
cruellest [sic] thing in the world," Clare muses, as she and Irene
contemplate what exposure of Clare's ruse might mean, and we are left
to speculate on what becomes of her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what the purpose, passing always takes stealth and
gumption, cunning, agility and a certain social conceit. A passer
stays in character no matter what. Stared down in the segregated
hotel dining room, Irene's first reaction is to think her hat is on
backwards or that her powder is streaked until that "small inner
disturbance, odious and hatefully familiar" finally rises in her,
though she does not give into it.</TE>
<TE>   The option of passing is foreclosed to many of Larsen's
characters. It requires the face, skin color, body type, style and/or
behavior that defy or confound easy profiling. With the props of
appearance and talent, passers have the ability to step out of those
identities dictated by genes, heritage, training, circumstance or
happenstance. Irene scoffs at the folly of would-be phenotypers who
think they can spot a black person by "the most ridiculous means,
fingernails, palms of hands, shapes of ears, teeth and other equally
silly rot." And yet, passers know, it is the absence of such markers
that helps make their performances convincing.</TE>
<TE>   Passers hide their origins. They need the complicity, the safe
distance or death of those who knew them when. For part-timers, the
equivalent would be keeping away people familiar with the passer's
secret life. Clare, having involved herself with the Harlem elite,
knows the "race loyalty" of her friends old and new will keep them
from outing her. It is part of their culture to protect her, for her
daughter's sake at least. As a rule, passers do not bring their past
(or their present, in the case of gays who pass for straight at work)
to the table.</TE>
<TE>   Passing, therefore, takes guile. Keeping secrets, or at least
avoiding certain disclosures, is a given in any passing story, and in
traditional passing narratives, the unmasking of the passer, the
exposure of the deception, is a moment of high drama. Shock,
accusation, revulsion and/or violence on the part of the deceived are
the reactions we expect. (Think Julie in "Showboat" or Sarah Jane in
the Douglas Sirk film version of "Imitation of Life." Remember the
reaction of Fergus, who is passing as Jimmy in "The Crying Game,"
when he learns the secret of Dil, who is passing too?) Larsen
concocts such a moment for Clare.</TE>
<TE>   The exposed passer is instantly subject to disgrace, loss of
position, expulsion from the desired situation--sometimes even jail
or death. The typical moral of the story is that passing, if not bad,
is at least a really bad idea, and that life will punish the passer
for breaking the rules.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, the arc of the story in more contemporary passing tales,
both true and fictive, makes room for a more complicated response.
Today we tend to react against the institution, situation or
environment that has made the deception necessary instead of to the
deception itself.</TE>
<TE>   In recent real-life stories, the deathbed medical examination that
exposed as female the jazz musician Billy Tipton, a man-about-town in
Spokane, brought a response of compassion more than anger from those
who thought they knew the five-times-"married" saxophone player.</TE>
<TE>   And in the case of Brandon Teena, who was raped and killed for
living as a man, the subterfuge pales against the brutality of the
young Nebraskan's executioners and their gruesome exhibition of
ignorance and hate. The compassion the Teena story evokes makes
passing seem almost valiant, or at least not a priori bad. It is as
sad a story as ever, just as in all the tragic mulatto tales of yore,
especially when it results in so shockingly tragic an end.</TE>
<TE>   Larsen's Clare elicits no such compassion. She tells us without
apology that she lacks "proper morals or sense of duty," that she
"would hurt anybody, throw anything away" to get what she wants. Yet
her life and demise are no less tragic than Teena's in one important
way: an unjust system forced them to pass in order to live the lives
they wanted to live.</TE>
<TE>   In a review of "Passing" in The Crisis in 1929, W.E.B. DuBois
prophesied that the whole business of black passing, though of great
moral import at the time, was really "all a petty, silly matter of no
real importance which another generation will comprehend with great
difficulty." Hasten the day.</TE>

<LD>THE BEHOLDER</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   by Thomas Farber</LD>
<TE>   Metropolitan Books: 196 pp., $22</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Farber wants to melt into his subject. Usually, that's
water; he's a surfer. When it's not water, it's love. The mythical
kind. The talk-till-all-hours, bone-rattling passion,
I-can't-be-with-you-it-will-destroy-me kind. But when he writes about
water, you can also feel the earth move. Love is torture for Farber.
Water is pure pleasure. "On Water," Farber's 1994 nonfiction book on
surfing, mostly in Hawaii, was "an effort to read water--to find
words for what was right before my eyes--as well as an appraisal of
how others had read it."</TE>
<TE>   That's Farber 's brain explaining "On Water." Actually, it was the
writer creating a new language, his own, but also universal; language
being born before the reader's eyes right out of nature and man's
experience in nature--the way it was in the beginning. The sentences
in "On Water" did not play by the usual rules. They played by water
rules, crashing and foaming or rolling on gently to a casual end.</TE>
<TE>   "A Lover's Question," a collection of stories, was published in
2000, but a writer like Farber needs room to move around. The more
formal the constraints, the more difficult he is to read. The stories
are so compressed they tumble over each other like puppies. Farber
doesn't wallow well in detail, so the stories are too bald: she fell
in love, it hurt, she died sort of thing.</TE>
<TE>   "The Face of the Deep" (1998) was a continuation of the meditation
on water and on Farber's travels through the Pacific Islands; Samoa,
Cocos Island and Hawaii on a National Endowment for the Arts grant.
The book's style is more journalistic than "On Water." In other
words, Farber uses complete sentences. He's on his best behavior,
because of the grant and all.</TE>
<TE>   Still, sentences like these slip through: "This continuum,
concatenation, of sunrises and sunsets, Venus strong in the early
night sky, Jupiter pulsing before daybreak. Solar days dazzling,
overwhelming, dream state without beginning or end. Night: gibbous
moon riding high, rivers, torrents of wind tattooing eddies and
swirls on the skin of the ocean."</TE>
<TE>   In this new novel, "The Beholder," Farber uses the language he
created to write about water to write about his nemesis, love.
Sometimes it sounds like stream-of-consciousness, but it's not; it's
just Farber rushing to meet his point, to meet what he considers to
be the salient essence of that phrase, that piece of the puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   "Her sensibility, journey to their first meeting. Pain, sorrow.
Self-invention. Story she tells herself; story the writer hears. He
pictures, is intended to picture, an almost princess, a faraway
land." There are only two characters in the novel: a writer, 49,
single, and a married woman, young enough to "be his daughter."</TE>
<TE>   The writer is referred to in the third person as "the writer," a
character who has made several appearances in Farber's previous
fiction. He's dapper, lonely, surrounded by people. He's a surfer.
She is literally a princess from a foreign country, pursuing a career
in academia. As in Farber's other fiction, there is a lot of talk
about Art, what it is, what it means, whether it's more or less
important than anything else.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship, the sex and the talk, reminds a reader
immediately of Milan Kundera's fiction. It is a relationship that
challenges conventional social morality and in so doing calls into
question the fabric of that society, its politics, its culture, its
class structure. It is a relationship with a mean streak a mile wide.
The writer and the princess pretend, throughout the relationship,
that they are father and daughter. This makes a reader want to look
away even while we behold, like guilty voyeurs, this relationship on
paper.</TE>
<TE>   But the writing makes the relationship feel quite organic. We know
there will be a natural decay, like a wave running to shore. There is
a pitch and a slide, all very gentle, but no less painful than any
other relationship. As in Kundera, there is something inevitable,
historic, about its demise.</TE>
<TE>   The writer has a friend who tells him that writers are "the canary
in the mine shaft"; they explore emotions and play with situations to
see what dangers lurk, how we might feel, how a situation might
change a person.</TE>
<TE>   "Stress," the friend says, "is resistance to things as they are."
Farber's characters slam headlong into "things as they are." In fact,
they move toward that point on the horizon like geologic, rather than
biological, beings. This makes them more and less real at the same
time. It is what makes Farber's fiction so original. It could not be
done in any other language than Farber's own. He had to make it up
himself. The risks he takes make him a canary in the literary coal
mine.</TE>

<HD>Remembering Chaim Potok</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THANE ROSENBAUM</AU>
<BD>Thane Rosenbaum is the author of the novels "The Golems
of Gotham" and "Second Hand Smoke."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes no matter how many books an author writes, one of them
stands out above the rest. This is the book that is read by more
people and can define an entire career. Henry Roth's first novel,
"Call It Sleep" heralded and sustained his literary reputation
although he wouldn't publish another book for decades. Elie Wiesel
has written many books, but is mostly known for his first, the
memoir, "Night." Then there is Chaim Potok, who died July 23 at the
age of 73, and his first book "The Chosen."</LD>
<LD>   Potok clearly participated in that great renaissance of
Jewish-American writing that flowered in the second half of the 20th
century, but his fiction wasn't overly respected among critics, even
though "The Chosen" was read by almost everyone. Writers such as Saul
Bellow, Philip Roth, Bernard Malamud and Cynthia Ozick were taken
much more seriously, but among Jews and gentiles alike, "The Chosen"
wound up on many more bookshelves and inside more classrooms and was
arguably as influential as J.D. Salinger's "The Catcher in the Rye."
"The Chosen" has remained a perennial seller since its publication in
1967.</LD>
<TE>   "The Chosen" is the story of a friendship between two Jewish boys
who lived in the Brooklyn shtetl of Williamsburg during World War II.
One of them is an heir-apparent rabbi in a Hasidic dynasty; the other
comes from a Orthodox family that adopts a more secular American
lifestyle. And yet they meet in the most American of childhood
pursuits, during a game of baseball. The Hasid eventually leaves the
community and embraces Freud while studying to become a psychologist;
the other, ironically, becomes a rabbi.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fact that the story is packaged with a "for Jews only"
title, it invokes many universal truths about fathers and sons,
destinies and departures, silences and inner screams and the stresses
on faith that come with the distraction of modern society. As a
reminder of a vanishing world that miraculously was resurrected in
America, the novel resonated deeply, regardless of the reader's
cultural heritage or ethnic background.</TE>
<TE>   Those who read "The Chosen" instantaneously felt a deep intimacy
with the Jewish Orthodox world, which is a tremendous achievement for
a book that depicts the nuances of a closed-off society. The novel
taught countless readers about Orthodox Judaism, but never sanitized
the experience by making it more acceptably American and less Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed "The Chosen" may have been among the first truly
multicultural American novels. It luxuriated in its cultural
uniqueness, its unabashed ethnic and religious particularity, its
free-spirited yet honest ambivalence about what it means to
voluntarily remain outside the margins of the American mainstream.
Potok showed us ghettos of self-exile in which the choice of
seclusion was made freely, but not without inner conflict. The title
of the novel didn't mince words: These characters were Jewish, they
were chosen, but for something perhaps entirely different from what
was originally planned.</TE>
<TE>   Other Jewish novelists were outflanking each other in producing a
literature of escape and disguise. Their characters were awash in the
homogeneous waters of assimilation, scrubbing off the accents, shame
and stigma of the Ellis Island arrival. Potok, unapologetically and
by contrast, decided to center many of his novels in a world that
existed within America, but shared far more emotional baggage with a
European Jewish life that was being murdered and annihilated across
the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   What we learned from him is that observant Jews also felt burdened
by the religious imperatives of being the chosen people. But they
also experienced the head rush and weak knees that came from living
in such close, seductive proximity to modernity. Potok was not a
modernist writer, yet his characters had to contend with modernist
concerns. Their lives are at first closed-off by the callings of the
theological universe, but eventually these tentative repressed
figures find themselves reading Freud, as in "The Chosen," or
painting wild, impiously desecrating images, as in "My Name Is Asher
Lev," or are haunted by musical sounds, as in "Davita's Harp."
Indeed, for a man steeped in Talmud and trained as a rabbi, Potok had
a surprisingly keen aesthetic and sensory appreciation of the natural
world, far more so than other Jewish novelists whose work have been
deemed more literary, if not as commercial.</TE>
<TE>   The critics dubbed his prose as being too straightforward and his
plots overly sentimental. Perhaps this criticism comes from having
written a bestseller, which is lovely for the bank account but is
seen by some as a terrible label for literature. (Nevertheless, in
spite of the brisk sales and brusque critical reception, "The Chosen"
was nominated for the National Book Award.)</TE>
<TE>   Enigmatically, Potok is more closely aligned with Leon Uris,
Howard Fast and Herman Wouk than to those whom he should be more
properly compared. Yet literary reputations are always fragile and in
flux. Some authors are read more widely after their deaths, and some
popular writers are suddenly taken more seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chosen" will continue to have an immense influence on Jewish
literature and American culture. Potok could have titled his novel
differently, but no matter what it was called, the reading public
would have eventually chosen it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SASSO</LD>
<LD>   By James Sturz</LD>
<LD>   Walker &amp; Co.: 312 pp., $24.95</LD>
<TE>   "So what am I doing in this funky spelunky southern Italian town
anyway, lodged like a pebble in the instep of the Italian boot?" The
"funky spelunky" town in question is cave-pocked Mancanzano, and the
narrator of this literate thriller is a nameless young cultural
anthropologist from New York who finds himself attached to a yearlong
dig exploring this fictional town's grottoes.</TE>
<TE>   The team, a ragtag crew of eccentrics from America, Britain and
Holland, is working to locate and preserve the endangered frescoes
painted onto the caves' delicate interiors: The entire town, it turns
out, is built upon soft, crumbly tufa, a chalky substance thought to
have salutary powers. Some of the locals even grate it, like
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, over their pasta.</TE>
<TE>   But as the team continues its work, it begins to stumble upon the
nude corpses of teenage lovers, their mouths mysteriously full of
tufa. What ensues is the often hilarious investigation of an
ever-widening epidemic of apparent death by coitus, as James Sturz
unearths the unlikely habits of a town where "houses fold into each
other like a distended urban origami." Sturz has a flair for nifty
turns of phrase, and this farcical whodunit is loaded, like
Mancanzano itself, with pockets to get delightfully lost in: there
are tangents about everything from art history and geology to sex and
Italian politics. If "Sasso" (the word means "stone" in Italian)
threatens to crumble into a hodgepodge, it only better serves its
theme of the porousness of reality: "Truth," as the narrator
eventually discovers, "is opacities, ambiguities, and spaces of
darkness and blinding sun."</TE>

<TE>   THE ART OF SEEING</TE>
<TE>   By Cammie McGovern</TE>
<TE>   Scribner: 286 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Cammie McGovern's first novel is an inventive meditation on the
plight of the younger sister, "born with an eye not on the horizon,
but on the hem of a shirt just ahead, the flash of a ponytail
whipping side to side." For Jemma Phillips, that shirt and ponytail
belong to big sister Rozzie, a headstrong high-school actress who
lands a role in a Hollywood movie.</TE>
<TE>   "The Art of Seeing" takes a magnifying glass to sisterly roles and
perceptions distorted by fame. There's Rozzie, toiling on movie sets
and winding up in the gossip pages; her world is enveloping, but
leaves her unprotected. As for Jemma, she's often called in to keep
Rozzie sane, a subsidiary role that Jemma accepts with only vague
queasiness.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to the high-flying Rozzie, Jemma is a typically
earthbound teen. Collegiate pastimes come awkwardly: "I don't know
how to pump a keg smoothly or get stoned without coughing," she tells
us. But Jemma is an acute observer of her surroundings, and she
decides to become a photographer, choosing the more anonymous
trajectory of art.</TE>
<TE>   When Rozzie begins to lose her eyesight, this tortoise-and-hare
story becomes deliciously complicated. Rozzie's blindness provides
Jemma with stirring photographic subject matter and stunning
opportunities for betrayal. It also allows McGovern to explore the
deep shadows thrown by sisterly rivalry: "I've lived for the electric
thrill of her attention," Jemma admits, "the spotlight feel of her
eyes on me alone." In the "The Art of Seeing," McGovern skillfully
reflects the spotlight of fame back on itself.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TEMPTING FAITH DiNAPOLI</TE>
<TE>   By Lisa Gabriele</TE>
<TE>   Simon &amp; Schuster: 224 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Halfway through this novel, which has the intimacy of a memoir,
Faith DiNapoli takes up the time-honored teen habit of shoplifting.
She's in the midst of that awkward phase of being alternately
fascinated and grossed out by boys, puffing the occasional cigarette,
and recognizing how weird her family is. When she's finally busted
for stealing, Faith, our companionable coming-of-age narrator, feels
she's become "the center of attention in a family that had no center,
or ability to pay attention." Lisa Gabriele gives us a family
portrait that's as affectionate as it is rueful: For the DiNapolis of
suburban Detroit (they live on the Canadian side), the center
disintegrates when father Joe, a meek Italian immigrant, takes a
construction gig in faraway Calgary. Not that Faith's mother, the
hard-nosed Nancy, really cares. As Faith's kleptomania expands to
include stealing glances at her mom's diary, she learns that her
parents' marriage is essentially over, that her mother lusts after a
neighbor boy, and that she's obsessed with money.</TE>
<TE>   It's no surprise--the DiNapolis are barely getting by, and
Gabriele shows us just how rough it is for a single mom, even one as
cold-blooded as Nancy, to make it with four kids and a restaurant
job.</TE>
<TE>   With its eye on Foreigner concerts and an ear for hilarious slang,
"Tempting Faith DiNapoli" charmingly evokes the pubescent folkways of
the early '80s. But this diverting novel is not so much an exercise
in sociology as an unabashed celebration of growing up, even if
you're poor, Catholic and Canadian.</TE>

<HD>Talk of the Town</HD>
<DH>Witty, smart and cruel, Lillian Ross is the queen of a
style both choreographed and evanescent</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE SIEGEL</AU>
<BD>Lee Siegel is a contributing writer to Book Review and
the recipient of the 2002 National Magazine Award for reviews and
criticism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The "Talk of the Town" section of The New Yorker has become a cross
between an institution independent of the magazine where it appears
and a journalistic genre unto itself. Composed of brief vignettes
that touch on a variety of subjects, the section for a long time
breathed the air of sophistication so sure of itself that it could
abandon any appearance of sophistication. The contributors affected a
manner of unflappable insouciance, a confidence so powerful that it
could display the most complete openness and tolerance and curiosity.
There was something of the English lord on tour about the tone, and
maybe that's why for decades the writers famously used "we" instead
of the first person, as a kind of democratic pretense.</LD>
<LD>   Nowadays, "Talk of the Town's" turf has mostly shifted from the
superior sensibility surveying the ordinary circumstance to the
ordinary journalist infiltrating the celebrity-occasion, but the
presumption is the same: The writer's ego serves as midwife to the
Principle of Urbanity.</LD>
<TE>   Lillian Ross, the legendary master of the "Talk of the Town"
genre, who has been writing for The New Yorker since 1945, intends
her new collection of Talk pieces and New Yorker profiles,
interspersed with instructing commentary, to be a kind of master
class for aspiring journalists, as well as a sequel to her book
"Reporting." In terms of formal near-perfection, Ross' style is
indeed enviable. You can no more resist plunging from one of her
finely chiseled sentences to the next any more than you can keep your
eyes from following the camera as it leads you from frame to frame
during a film. Ross wouldn't mind the analogy; she herself compares
her technique to creating a movie frame by frame. She wants to be
supremely diverting, no more, no less; and she almost always succeeds
in being supremely diverting, no more, no less.</TE>
<TE>   But something unsettling creeps underneath the formal polish of
Ross' style. In nearly everything she writes, and couched in the
atmosphere of cosmopolitan openness and tolerance, you encounter a
deflation of her subjects. She lets the air out in her memoir, "Here
but Not Here," in which she punctures the public image of William
Shawn, The New Yorker's near-mythic former editor, under the guise of
paying homage to him. As Ross herself puts it: "There is no avoiding
the fact that the very nature of a reporter, of every writer, is
revealed in his writing."</TE>
<TE>   "I trust my response to a person in the first few minutes of
meeting him," Ross declares in her introduction. Elsewhere she
writes: "I immediately knew on the spot what I was going to write and
how I would write it." And again: "After talking with Bianca [a child
actor] I knew immediately what my story should be." If, according to
Ross, her instincts are infallible, her personality is magnetic. Even
as a young New Yorker staffer, just starting out, she apparently had
no trouble meeting anyone she wanted to. In Hollywood for the first
time, "heady stuff immediately came my way. Everybody in the
business, I learned, was eager to talk to me. Movie stars. Directors.
Producers. I was invited to big, lavish parties." And in the midst of
such dizzying glamour and glitter, Ross' Delphic-like viscera rose to
the occasion: "Almost immediately, wherever I turned, I sensed what
my story would be. Nervousness and uncertainty were all around me."</TE>
<TE>   The "almost" is a rare bit of modesty, but the portrait of
powerful movie stars and directors and producers unable to hide their
nervousness and uncertainty around the confident young reporter is
all of a piece with Ross' tone throughout the book, except that she
usually reserves her deflations for ordinary people, not for the
powerful and the famous. With ordinary people, she is Eustace Tilley
with a switchblade. In the presence of the latter group, with Norman
Mailer and John Huston and Charlie Chaplin and Harold Pinter, she is
the journalist as congenial mistress.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, throughout 40 years, as she revealed in her memoir, Ross
was the mistress of Shawn, who returned every night to his wife and
family, a few blocks away. "With Bill Shawn," she writes in the
introduction to this book, "I developed tolerance, judgment, and
taste.... William Shawn encouraged me to distill my own sense of
humor in my work. I loved making him laugh." Ross is obsessed with
laughter and humor. She writes, she tells us, "in the service of
laughter and truth." She refers to "those most precious
attributes--laughter and humor." Her valuation of humor is strangely
emphatic: "It's humor that drives a story. It's the key to
originality and power in reporting. This reporter couldn't live, let
alone work, without laughing."</TE>
<TE>   But Ross' laughter is the dark kind, a cruel Nabokovian laughter
minus the redemptive Nabokovian imagination. In her 1960 article "The
Yellow Bus," Ross describes the experience of a group of high school
kids from the Midwest who take a trip to New York with their teacher.
Ross introduces the article with characteristic self-deprecation:
"Permission to replicate copies of the piece, in the intervening
decades, is still requested several times a year by journalism
teachers. Apparently, I'm pleased to hear, it's called a 'cult'
piece." But what's special about "The Yellow Bus" isn't the way it's
put together, expertly assembled as it is with Ross'--and The New
Yorker's--distinctive blend of fanatical details and shaping
sensibility. What's special is Ross' use of "humor."</TE>
<TE>   Ross concludes the article with a dialogue among the students, who
express their various attitudes toward New York. Like most people,
especially young people, who visit New York from other places,
especially rural places, the high school seniors from Indiana are
daunted by the experience, and so they defy their intimidation by
flaunting dislike of the city. Ross' transcription--and
orchestration--of their conversation concludes like this: " 'I hate
New York,' Connie said." Ross then inserts this commentary:</TE>
<TE>   " ... the characterization of individuals in 'The Yellow Bus' was
very light, just enough to support the characterization of the group
as a whole in their limited capacity to respond, or pitiful inability
to respond, to what was being offered to them.... Still, there is
humor in the way these high school kids resisted being touched by New
York. To me, it's funny to hear Connie say, 'I hate New York.' "</TE>
<TE>   Very funny, that pitiful inability to respond. And if Ross can't
contrive the mortification of other people to demonstrate her good
humor, which Shawn taught to his patient mistress, she reshapes her
subjects into something ridiculous. She goes on: "In 1945, I wrote my
first "Talk of the Town" story, about another kind of visitor who
made me laugh. It was called 'One Man's Family,' about 24-year-old
Ahmad-Abdul Jabbar, who was staying at the Waldorf with his Saudi
United Nations delegation .... I came to this one without any
preconceptions. My ignorance made it possible for me to start
laughing immediately."</TE>
<TE>   So exquisitely choreographed is Ross' style--choreographed is the
wrong word; she uses pacing and repetition the way a pianist uses
pedals--that the obtuseness which accompanies her blithe cruelty
often slips past the reader. Amid all those Salinger-like lists of
brand names and fashion styles and designer names in which someone
always seems to be wearing an Hermes tie--is it because that is the
most easily identifiable tie?--you can miss the way her vanity clouds
her perceptions. Chronicling a day in the life of Manhattan's
privileged adolescents, about whom she is in the end as passively
vicious as she was to the unsuspecting Hoosiers, she writes at one
point: "I was deeply touched by the way they accepted me, strangely
enough, as one of them. I told them I was doing some reporting for
The New Yorker, but they didn't seem impressed, just mildly
interested.... They were respecting and accepting and curious." But a
15-year-old at Manhattan's Spence School lives or dies on the ability
to seem not impressed, just mildly interested. And being respecting,
accepting and curious is one way to win a journalist's heart.</TE>
<TE>   It's not surprising that the kids recognized Ross as one of them.
She was the boss' girlfriend, the spoiled brat of The New Yorker, who
could indulge her childlike spite behind the mask of her
woman-about-town refinement, who won her fame from the fact that, as
the boss' girlfriend, she had entree to the famous. That Ross has
talent is undeniable, but one would have to be an idiot not to make
riveting the transcription of intimate conversation by Robert F.
Kennedy or Huston or Chaplin.</TE>
<TE>   And yet for all her opportunities, Ross' subjects never appear
much different from the way we had always thought of them. Hemingway
is always talking about sports, Mailer is feistily ambitious, Huston
is outsized and blunt. Ross doomed her famous subjects to their
appearances. It might have been her revenge for serving as second
fiddle for a man excessively devoted to appearances. But in the end,
her famous subjects prized their appearances and, like her
double-edged compliments, Ross' unempathetic caricatures ensured her
success. They also, as this vain, empty book makes clear, guarantee
her evanescence.</TE>

<HD>Defender of the Faith</HD>
<DH>WHY I AM A CATHOLIC: By Garry Wills, Houghton Mifflin: 390
pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW SULLIVAN</AU>
<BD>Andrew Sullivan is a senior editor at The New Republic
and writes for www.andrewsullivan.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever else can be said in praise of Garry Wills, no one can
quibble with his sense of timing. If someone had asked me what kind
of book I'd most want to read right now, one called "Why I Am a
Catholic" would have been extremely high on the list. We Catholics
have had a horrendous year.</LD>
<LD>   The unraveling of the chicanery, corruption, clericalism and
downright criminality in the upper reaches of the hierarchy have
largely shattered what was left of lay Catholics' faith in the formal
institution others call the church. So it is with real gratitude that
one reads a book affirming soberly and resolutely that the
discredited hierarchy is not synonymous with the church. The church,
as the Second Vatican Council definitively argued, is comprised of
"the people of God." And one of the--yes--miraculous phenomena of
these harrowing times is the tenacity of that other institution: the
real, breathing, human church, a people still passionate about our
faith, whatever the iniquities of our authoritative representatives.</LD>
<TE>   But Wills is too intelligent to fall into the trap of
Protestantizing what Vatican II understood. He shows the inherent
Catholicism of the second council the hard way--through painstaking
history. His argument is not about debunking Catholicism in favor of
some ephemeral, modern watered-down alternative. It's about restoring
the other Catholic tradition that has been obscured in which the
institutional church was the servant of the faithful and not the
other way around.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of this book is therefore a slow, sometimes pedantic,
ecclesiastical chronology. Drawing on a plethora of contemporary (and
old) scholarship, Wills shows how the papacy emerged alongside the
church as a critical facilitating institution for the people of God.
The problem of the church's current crisis, Wills argues, is
therefore not the papacy as such. It is the anachronistic and stunted
view of papal autocracy.</TE>
<TE>   And here, the key to Wills' Catholicism is found in the writing of
St. Augustine, interspersed with solid helpings of G.K. Chesterton
and Cardinal John Henry Newman. The founding stone of Wills' faith is
the founding stone of the church itself: Peter, the first Christian
leader, the weak, clumsy, vacillating liar chosen as the first
shepherd of Jesus' flock. Some Catholics have viewed the famous
Gospel passage in Matthew in which Jesus vests authority in Peter as
the rock on which his church will be built as the beginning of a
singular and unquestionable papal authority, stretching seamlessly
from the first pope to the current one. Wills begs to differ. And he
quotes Augustine to show how:</TE>
<TE>   "When Peter was told, 'I will give you the keys of heaven's
kingdom, and what you tie on earth will have been tied in heaven,
what you untie on earth will have been untied in heaven,' he was
standing for the entire church, which does not collapse though it is
beaten, in this world, by every kind of trial, as if by rain, flood,
and tempest. It is founded on a Stone [Petra], from which Peter took
his name Stone-founded [Petrus]; for the Stone did not take its name
from the Stone-Founded, but the Stone-Founded from the Stone--as
Christ does not take his name from Christians, but Christians from
Christ.... Because the Stone was Christ."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't mere wordplay. It's critical. The pope is not the
stone, just as the church is not the pope. The founding stone is
Christ, of which Peter is a mere unifying servant. The papacy is a
critical symbol of the unity of the church, but it is not the source
of actual, unimpeachable authority. It is an institution of
inclusion, not dictatorship. Because the papacy is such a human
entity, it also errs. This is not an exception to the rule of the
papacy; it is the rule itself. And when you think of the sometimes
sordid, sometimes inspired and sometimes downright murderous history
of the papacy, you see how that must be. We are obliged as Catholics
to differ from the pope in many ways and at many times in
history--since he is merely the human symbol of the church's call to
shepherd Christ's flock, and he will sin and lose his way as Peter
did. He may even deny the very savior he is supposed to represent, as
Peter did. But the church prevails because the papacy is not the
church; it is not even the stone. But it is "Stone-Founded."</TE>
<TE>   Why not just reject the "stone-founded" and become a Protestant?
The answer is an obvious one: Because Jesus instituted this unifying
element in the church and because we have no other source of
authority. But what about the Bible, as Protestants argue? Because,
quite simply, the Bible is not independent of the church. It was
compiled by the early church; its very contents were arrived at by a
process of debate and chance and institutional combat. The Bible is a
product of tradition--not the other way round. Our very faith as
Christians is dependent on a legacy of fallible human beings
remembering, believing, questioning and praying. We have no other way
to know the meaning of the God of the New Testament. This is our
human inheritance--of a divine revelation.</TE>
<TE>   Once Wills has established this argument--and, sadly, it takes him
far too long--we can see why his own explication of his faith makes
sense. And what struck this reader was his obvious and passionate
love for this faith and this institution, his commitment to stick
with it, because, as Chesterton put it, "the severed hand does not
heal the whole body."</TE>
<TE>   Wills is so right that there is something simply bizarre about a
church committing suicide because there can be no compromise over
such a minor, administrative matter as priestly celibacy, while the
vast majority of its faithful disagree on nothing substantive in its
actual creed. This is a skewing of priorities which is in itself a
function of a doctrine of papal authority gone bad. And one of the
oddest things about the most ferociously orthodox of today's
Catholics is how close they are to the view of many ignorant
non-Catholics: that the church is (in historian Paul Johnson's words)
"a divine autocracy," that the pope is the infallible dictator, that
he cannot err, that unthinking obedience and silence is the correct
posture of any believing Catholic, that disagreeing on minor matters
is indistinguishable from differing on major issues and so on. This
is not merely philistine and anti-intellectual. Properly speaking, as
Wills powerfully argues, it is anti-Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   But one arrives at the end of Wills' argument with a sense of
fast-accelerating disappointment. The book is 342 pages long (without
the index and notes), but it is only by Page 295 that we actually get
Wills' explanation of his own faith. The disappointment is even more
intense because the next 60 pages are full of tantalizing thoughts
and ideas, only cursorily explored. Sure, the book opens with a
diverting glimpse of Wills' own childhood and adolescent emergence as
a Catholic, but the core of his adult faith is still provided almost
as an afterthought.</TE>
<TE>   When Wills captures something in theology, it can be exhilarating,
a reminder of what good priests used to do from the pulpit. Take his
description of the Trinity, where he again deploys Augustine to
memorable effect. Augustine is discussing the mystery of how God can
be three beings in one. He argues that this three-part divinity, in
some sense, must be true if God is, as Christians believe, the
profoundest manifestation of love. God the Father cannot father
himself; but if his fatherhood is bound by time and place, as it is
for human fathers, then at some time he wasn't a father, and the love
he expresses didn't have an object. So the Son always had to be there
as an object of love--eternally. And the relationship--the act of
loving--is equally eternal. As Augustine saw: "Love is the act of a
lover and the love given to a loved person. It is a trinity: the
lover, loved and love itself." God the Father, God the Son, God the
Holy Spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, in Wills' own words, "The Christian doctrine of the
Trinity means that it is not good for God to be alone. He is a
society, a dialogue, a set of interrelationships that impel him out
from himself toward himself. He is pure act, and the divinity is a
raging field of energy, of self-emptying to fulfill the self."</TE>
<TE>   I wanted more of this. And I wanted it because it is so rare these
days in a church bent on the destruction of its own priesthood. I
wanted it because it reminds me of what Catholicism should be--a
rapturous relationship of the faithful with the divine, together,
thinking and praying and arguing, and doing so in an atmosphere of
openness and hope, of humility but energy. Wills has shown how this
can be so. The rest of us now have to insist that it lives and
breathes in the wounded, faltering church we now inhabit.</TE>

<DH>THE BLACK FEMALE BODY: A Photographic History By Deborah
Willis and Carla Williams, Temple University Press: 228 pp., $60</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAULA L. WOODS</AU>
<BD>Paula L. Woods is the author of "Inner City Blues" and
"Stormy Weather: A Charlotte Justice Novel."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All children have a hunger to see themselves in the world, and as a
black child of the mid-20th century, I was starved for positive
images of African Americans. It wasn't enough to see them in the
flesh--that occurred daily in my largely segregated neighborhood. I
wanted to see them captured in printed or moving pictures, believing
these images bestowed a certain validity and legitimacy to their
existence.</LD>
<LD>   When it came to black women, what little imagery I saw in the '50s
and '60s was confusing. In movies, there was Hattie McDaniel, who
appeared in myriad Mammy-to-maid guises in films of the '30s and
'40s. African Americans' relationship to McDaniel was complex. She
was both harshly reviled (did white people think we were all like
that?) and grudgingly respected (after all, McDaniel did get paid).</LD>
<LD>   As for print media, black-owned magazines--particularly those
published before the 1970s--presented equally iconic and simplistic
photographs of the saintly mothers of the civil-rights movement or of
saucily clad centerfolds. All of which could leave a black girl,
growing into womanhood bracketed by the civil rights and women's
movements, uncertain of just who and how to be, especially in
relationship to her own body.</LD>
<TE>   How much easier it would have been for me--and perhaps other young
women of my generation--to have had photo historian Deborah Willis'
and photographer-writer Carla Williams' "The Black Female Body: A
Photographic History" as a cultural and visual Rosetta stone. For in
their exhaustive culling and pairing of historical and contemporary
photos with insightful commentary, Willis and Williams contend that
"the history of [the black female] image is deeply rooted in
representations of our mostly unclothed bodies." It is an idea that
is revelatory yet implicitly understood by every black woman who
cringes at the gyrations of Lil' Kim or Tweet on video or has weighed
in on the debate surrounding the sexual mores of Leticia Musgrove,
the character portrayed by Halle Berry in "Monster's Ball." Clothed
or unclothed, Mammy or Lil' Kim, the damage that negative
representation does to the psyche of black women and those who view
the images is immense and subject to heated debate even today.</TE>
<TE>   Fully conscious of the pitfalls of once again "objectifying black
women by re-representing exploitive and derogatory images" from the
past, the authors include the images with an overarching aim: to
reveal how three aesthetic categories--the naked "National
Geographic" or "Jezebel," the neutered black female or "mammy," and
the noble savage--intersect and are intertwined throughout our
cultural history.</TE>
<TE>   To achieve their objective, the authors have included in Part 1,
"Colonial Conquest," images as early as the 1840s taken by
photographers who were primarily European and whose work reflected
not only the burgeoning popularity of the daguerreotype to capture
ethnographical and anthropological "specimens" but also the use of
the medium as a chronicler of popular culture.</TE>
<TE>   Most notable among these early images are the infamous 19th
century "Venus Hottentot," which caused a sensation in Europe, and
several mid-century representations of nude African women that, while
clinical in their composition, also forced the sitters to strip to
the waist or pose completely nude for the camera's examination. These
yield to more salacious images, including a group portrait of women
working in a brothel, a nude photograph of a disturbingly young girl
taken by the American painter Thomas Eakins and a pornographic 1850s
nude study that is in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Were these women exploited? Certainly, contend the authors. Even
when they were paid a pittance for their cooperation, they had no
control over their image. Willis and Williams make this perfectly
clear in assembling text and images that provide not only a visual
but social context to those who produced, and therefore retained
power over, the photographs and those who were subjected to the
process.</TE>
<TE>   The second part of the book, "The Cultural Body," considers how
representation of black women evolved from being a photographer's
object to the women exerting newly found power over how they would be
portrayed. An early example is the American abolitionist Sojourner
Truth, who kept careful control of her official mid-19th century
photograph at the same time as the black-woman-as-object photos were
being produced by Europeans.</TE>
<TE>   The authors also include early 20th century entertainer Josephine
Baker and writer Zora Neale Hurston, both of whom understood the
power of their image to shape perceptions of themselves and their
work. As Hurston wrote to photographer Carl Van Vechten about her
photo session: "I love myself when I am laughing. And then again when
I am looking mean and impressive."</TE>
<TE>   Other photographs that are part of this evolution include a
bracing collection of black women at work, including arguably the
most famous, Gordon Parks' "Washington, D.C., Government Charwoman
(Ella Watson)." Holding a mop and broom, Watson stands squarely
facing the camera, wearing a simple polka-dotted housedress, the
pattern echoed in the Stars and Stripes behind her.</TE>
<TE>   Black women's relationship to, and control over, their
representation was also part of another cycle of photography that
forms the third part of the book. "The Body Beautiful" incorporates
majestic, compelling pictures of the "New Negro" combining "black
photographers' input and the sitter's self-image to form critical
responses to the negative image of blacks some 60 years after the
abolition of slavery." Emerging from the works of historically
significant photographers such as James VanDerZee, Prentice H. Polk
and James Latimer Allen as well as contemporary artists Chester
Higgins, Fern Logan, Cynthia Wiggins, Clarissa Sligh, the late Roland
Charles of Los Angeles and the authors themselves, are images that,
while sometimes challenging, offer a self-defined and controlled
black beauty that stands in stark contrast to the passive and
slave-like images of earlier times.</TE>
<TE>   All of this is not to imply that white photographers were not
without sensitivity in portraying black women, or that black
photographers or sitters were incapable of debasing their art or
themselves. "The Black Female Body" gives ample examples of both. Yet
the overwhelming feeling one gets while viewing the haunting images
and reading the thoughtful text of this handsome keepsake is how
agency over one's representation can influence self-image and
self-esteem in the broader psychological and sociological realms, not
just when one is in front of the camera. Which is a message women of
all generations and colors can benefit from equally.</TE>
<TE>   Lil' Kims of the world, take note.</TE>

never dreamed of: classic children's tales as box-office heavyweights</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For Maurice Sendak, author of "Where the Wild Things Are," the road
from his 300-word children's classic to big-time Hollywood movie is
as fraught and perilous as his protagonist Max's encounter with the
island's wild things--hairy, yellow-eyed beasts that roar their
terrible roars and gnash their terrible teeth.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very excited about the prospect of it but rather cast down by
how difficult it is to achieve," the 74-year-old says by phone from
his home in Connecticut. "What the book was to the publishing world
of 1960, I want the movie to be to the movie world of today--a
totally original, transforming and transfixing work. My feeling is,
If it isn't terrific, why do it? To me, there's nothing worse than a
fine book destroyed just by being turned into a movie whose only
purpose is to survive Friday, Saturday and Sunday."</LD>
<LD>   Sendak evinces the mixture of trepidation and excitement many
authors--and devoted readers--feel when Hollywood approaches.
Although grown-ups can certainly survive bad Clancy or Grisham
movies, the stakes feel higher for children's and young adult
classics, the kind of books that have shaped young psyches for
decades and that are often remembered with quasi-religious sentiment.</LD>
<TE>   The challenge has not stopped Sendak from spending the past decade
pondering the prospect of bringing his fearsome creatures to
cinematic life, and spending three years in active development on the
picture with such cohorts as Universal Pictures and new producer Tom
Hanks.</TE>
<TE>   They're hardly alone in their quest to bring our deepest childhood
fantasies to the big screen. The success of film versions of "Harry
Potter" and "Lord of the Rings" has caused executives all over town
to ransack their childhood bookcases for the pearls of their youth.
Such totemic titles as "Curious George," "The Cat in the Hat," and
"Peter Pan," many of which have been sitting on dusty development
shelves for years, are now being turned into gigantic, tent-pole
event pictures. Indeed it's hard to think of one childhood classic,
from "The Wind in the Willows" to "A Cricket in Time Square" and "The
Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," that isn't being ministered to by
an eager team of screenwriters and producers.</TE>
<TE>   To some, Hollywood's mad search for forgotten childhood favorites
is more than a simple convergence of an exploding market for family
films and technological know-how, but an authentic attempt to grapple
with the nation's anxious mood. The town has collectively decided to
run for its teddy bears.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everyone wants a little departure from the post-9/11
world," says Douglas Wick, producer of the "Stuart Little" films. He
points out that some of the top-grossing films of World War II and
the immediate postwar period were Disney's "Bambi," "Cinderella,"
"Fantasia," "Pinocchio" and "Song of the South."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Disney films are chock-full of real emotions, not
the empty calories of, say, "Scooby-Doo." For children coping with
the carnage of WWII, the wrenching death of Bambi's mother resonated
with the world they faced.</TE>
<TE>   Wick and his wife, Lucy Fisher, are producing the live-action
"Peter Pan," now more than 100 years old but still emotionally
relevant, says Fisher. "What's so great about it, you get to fly
away, leave home, take on the worst, meanest grown-up in the world
[Captain Hook], played by your father, defeat the grown-up and come
home and still be re-embraced by your own family."</TE>
<TE>   Academy Award-winning actor-director Roberto Benigni says that his
new Italian-language version of "Pinocchio," has "one of the most
ancient messages, that we cannot be happy, and yet at the same time,
we have the duty to search for happiness."</TE>
<TE>   In his classic exploration of fairy tales, "The Uses of
Enchantment," psychologist Bruno Bettelheim wrote about how fairy
tales, and their themes of death and the need to be loved, help
children wrestle with complicated emotions.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, Hollywood has churned out some memorable
children's films from "Toy Story" to "Beauty and the Beast" to
"Shrek," animated comedies and romances that resonate with issues of
loss and self-worth.</TE>
<TE>   Upcoming films like "Where the Wild Things Are" or "Lemony
Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events: The Movie" or  "Tuck
Everlasting" could even expand the palette to deal with unsentimental
emotions like anger, powerlessness and awareness of our own
mortality, feelings that affect children as much as their parents in
an unsteady world.</TE>
<TE>   Many critics have noted the "Oliver Twist"-like darkness of "A
Series of Unfortunate Events," in which the Baudelaire orphans suffer
at the hands of evil Count Olaf. Its author, Daniel Handler--a.k.a.
Lemony Snicket--says the books "tap into a general sense of injustice
that everyone has felt in childhood, where crucial decisions are made
by someone much taller than you and not paying much attention to what
you want. Every child feels like their life is being governed by
forces who don't have time to listen and most adults feel that way
too."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the studio is wary of the darkness implicit in such works
as "Where the Wild Things Are," Universal's co-president of
production, Mary Parent, replies, "Are they dark or are they real?
Max has that classic dilemma--he's powerless but he yearns to be the
master of the kingdom. Kids want to be independent, but they depend
on their parents and their parents set the rules and dictate the
parameters around the kids' life. Even as adults, we're not masters
of our universe. We also push up against feelings of powerlessness.
There's a reason why these books are world-renowned. They resonate so
strongly."</TE>
<TE>   These books also come with fans--lots of them. "Curious George"
has sold some 25 million books, let alone all the ancillary Curious
George products in the marketplace. It's hard to imagine an American
child who hasn't read the absurdist rhymes of "The Cat in the Hat."</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody is hungry for brands, and having exhausted some
of the more recent brands that can be identified with TV shows and
comic books, they're reaching back to more classic literature,"
Paramount Motion Pictures President John Goldwyn says.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a greater appetite for them because when they work, they
work in a gigantic way," says producer Brian Grazer, who is hoping to
follow his "Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas" success with
big-screen versions of "The Cat in the Hat" and "Curious George."
"They also generate other byproducts that are natural to the piece.
It is natural to have some merchandising and toys."</TE>
<TE>   Kids' films also have a huge afterlife on DVD and video and, like
"The Sound of Music" or "The Wizard of Oz," can play yearly on TV for
decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Now you've also got technology. We have the ability to realize
these worlds and these characters that wouldn't be possible years
ago," adds Universal's Parent. Credit technology for the realism of
Stuart Little's fur and whiskers in "Stuart Little 2." After years of
languishing in development, with eight scripts and as many
approaches, "Curious George," for instance, is finally headed to
computer-generated life, with David Silverman, co-director of
"Monsters, Inc.," at the helm.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, as the experience with "Curious George" suggests, these kinds
of projects--particularly those based on picture books with strong
characters and little plot--can be difficult to translate to the
screen. They demand fidelity and yet require ingenuity, and the line
between the sacred and the profane (or worse, the boring) can be
thin.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few years ago, the industry was leery of trying because
even jewel-like versions of such books as "The Little Princess" and
"The Secret Garden" didn't set the box office on fire.</TE>
<TE>   More than a few eyebrows were raised when the "How the Grinch
Stole Christmas," Dr. Seuss' fable of anti-materialism, was turned
into a merchandizing bonanza, with green Oreos and Pop-Tarts, and the
famed green grouch emblazoned on an array of consumer products. For
the studio however, the glossy, eye-popping Grinch made for a very
green Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Now it seems as if every month brings another elaborate casting
search for the perfect child to spearhead the next juggernaut. In the
last few months, casting directors scoured the U.S., the U.K. and
Australia in search of the appropriately pint-sized Peter Pan,
ultimately settling on child actor Jeremy Sumpter. The new version of
J.M. Barrie's play will start filming under the guidance of director
P.J. Hogan on Sept. 30 in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting a lot of letters from children asking when the
["Lemony Snicket"] auditions are," Handler says. "I recently got a
large package from a boy in New York with his photograph and all his
films, which were home movies, and recordings of him singing a song
he wrote. My mother has also announced if she's not an extra, I will
no longer be welcome in her home."</TE>
<TE>   With more than 4 million in sales and its own cult-like following,
"Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events: The Movie" is slated
to start shooting early next year, with Barry Sonnenfeld directing
and Handler writing the script.</TE>
<TE>   To the relief of those who mistrust Hollywood's propensity for
sentimentality and sanctimony, famous children's books bring with
them famous authors, with not only contractual rights but also moral
rights over how their works are going to be realized. The writers, or
in the case of Dr. Seuss and Roald Dahl, the writer's heirs are the
keepers of the faith.</TE>
<TE>   "In every situation, it doesn't matter what is or isn't in the
contract. The reality is, if you make them [the writers] unhappy,
they're going to be unhappy and verbalize it," says Warner Bros.
Executive Vice President Lorenzo di Bonaventura. "If a studio
neglected the integrity of a creative person's vision, what creative
people would come to them?"</TE>
<TE>   In light of "Harry Potter" mania, the studio has treated author
J.K. Rowling with the respect befitting the Delphic oracle. Critics
carped that the film, directed by Chris Columbus, was slavishly
faithful to the book without its own animating purpose or
vision--fairly irrelevant complaints to the studio, which is touting
its nearly billion-dollar gross and happy author as a Hollywood seal
of approval.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who sell their books. I'm not condemning that,
but it ain't the way I do it," Sendak says. "The only important thing
for me is that I would have control. I would say yes or no to the
script, to the technique of making the film. I would bend and
compromise. I am by nature a collaborator, but in the case of 'Where
the Wild Things Are,' I have to be the final decider.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Many young musicians in Cuba were puzzled when the nostalgia of the
Buena Vista Social Club became a commercial phenomenon a few years
ago, earning dollars and Grammys for its aging artists.</LD>
<LD>   Some even felt a touch of resentment. They wondered why world
markets would embrace a group of old-timers and their dusty standards
when the island's hot new bands struggled to get attention for their
amazingly creative work.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Grammy spotlight has turned again on a Cuban old-timer,
although one who was already familiar to American audiences. Singer
Celia Cruz recently picked up four nominations in the third annual
Latin Grammy Awards for her latest album, "La Negra Tiene Tumbao,"
which must be her zillionth recording.</LD>
<TE>   Now nobody begrudges Celia her success. The artist is beloved here
and in her homeland, which she left long ago. But the question still
arises: Has the old guard again won out over the vanguard? Have Latin
Grammy voters in the tropical categories ignored great new salsa
music in favor of tried-and-true tradition?</TE>
<TE>   This time there is nothing to resent. Instead of making us feel
sorry for those left out, the success of Cruz and other veteran
tropical acts in this year's nominations makes us painfully aware
that there's not much out there to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   Where have all the great new salseros gone?</TE>
<TE>   Of the 20 nominations in four tropical categories this year, a
dozen went to old-time acts. In the salsa album category, where you'd
expect to find the latest stuff, three of the five nominees have been
around for decades. Aside from Cruz, they include middle-aged singer
Tito Rojas and El Gran Combo, the acclaimed Puerto Rican band that is
celebrating its 40th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   The other two nominations in that category went to Giro (who's
he?) and Marc Anthony, for his album "Libre." He may still be young,
but Marc Anthony hardly represents a fresh style or new vision in
salsa. The singer is so '90s.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuyorican's latest album is perhaps the weakest of his salsa
career, which was launched in 1993 under the aegis of producer Sergio
George, who also worked on the new Cruz album. George was at the
forefront of an early-'90s salsa revival on the New York scene, led
by Marc Anthony, La India and DLG.</TE>
<TE>   Designed to appeal to young, bicultural urban youth, that New York
salsa style now seems almost as dated as disco. Nothing has come
along to replace it, at least not in the Big Apple.</TE>
<TE>   That's why people still yearn for salsa's golden era, the boom
years of the '70s when Fania Records was the Motown of Latin music.
Styles come and go, but connoisseurs still snap up CD reissues of all
the great Fania artists. (Too bad the digital transfers are so
careless.) In those days, I was a student at UC Berkeley, part of a
small clique of Chicanos who prized salsa albums from New York the
way rock fans treasured British imports. Only a few stores carried
the new Fania releases. So whatever we could find we would buy, sound
unheard.</TE>
<TE>   When a friend traveled to New York in the summer of '74, I asked
her to bring back a few albums. Just buy whatever the store clerk
recommends, I told her.</TE>
<TE>   When she returned, it was as if Christmas had come early. Four of
the records she brought back are now classics: Willie Colon's "Lo
Mato," Larry Harlow's "Salsa," Ismael Rivera's "Traigo de Todo" and
the first album by the team of Celia Cruz and Johnny Pacheco, which
includes the hit "Quimbara."</TE>
<TE>   New York was salsa's London or L.A., a seemingly boundless
reservoir of artists making music that sounded fresh and exciting,
though it was grounded in ancient Afro-Cuban and Afro-Rican
traditions.</TE>
<TE>   You never knew what you'd discover on a new album, even from an
established artist. If you bought Ray Barretto's self-titled 1975
album featuring the cover with the congas that flapped open, you
heard a new and unknown singer on a couple of tracks. He sounded a
lot like Cheo Feliciano in those days, but his name was Ruben Blades.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the dreary '80s, with its pop salsa romantica craze. The
feel of the street, that exciting spontaneity, was gone from the
music. And it never came back, at least not at its original level.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, we've seen a spate of live albums by popular Puerto
Rican bands celebrating 30, 35, 40 years together. They include the
45th-anniversary album of La Sonora Poncena, and the 40th-anniversary
concerts by bandleader Tommy Olivencia and by El Gran Combo, whose
latest studio album is among the Latin Grammy nominees for best salsa
album.</TE>
<TE>   Bassist Bobby Valentin, a member of the Fania All Stars, this year
released his 35th anniversary album. It's a live performance titled
"Vuelve a la Carcel" (He Goes Back to Jail), a reference to his
acclaimed live albums recorded in 1975 at Puerto Rico's Oso Blanco
state prison. With Blades and Feliciano among his guest artists,
Valentin returned to perform for the prisoners, some of whom may have
seen the earlier concert almost three decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   It's a powerful record. All these bands sound better than ever. No
wonder the music of this era is now sometimes called "salsa dura," or
hard salsa, because it's heavy, as we'd say in the '60s. Those of us
who had a taste of it stayed hungry for it.</TE>
<TE>   That's why there was such a rush to Havana when the doors finally
opened in the late '80s and early '90s. The Cubans still had that
fire in the grooves. Each band had its own identity and each album
had surprises. With the embargo, Cuba was like a forbidden mecca. So
the treasure hunt started all over again: Just bring me back anything
from Havana, my friend.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, those days are over too. Many dynamic Cuban bands have lost
their way, falling into repetition or formulas. Whether in New York
or Havana, artists who once prided themselves on being progressive no
longer have grounds to complain if old-timers steal the spotlight.</TE>

<HD>She Put Glamour in the Picture</HD>
<DH>Photographer Ruth Harriet Louise gave 1920s stars their
glow. Now she's getting credit for her innovations.</DH>

<LD>"I have always said--and I still say it right out in print," wrote
Louella Parsons, doyenne of Hollywood gossip columnists, in March
1929, "that one of the finest photographers I know is a woman. I
speak of Ruth Harriet Louise, who has made Marion Davies, Norma
Shearer and other M-G-M beauties even more beautiful."</LD>
<LD>   At the time, Louise was only 26 and had already been MGM's chief
portrait photographer for four years. Shooting five to six sessions a
day, six days a week, her ubiquitous handiwork was seen on posters,
magazine covers, music sheets and other promotional material that
fueled movie fandom and the growing engine of Hollywood publicity.</LD>
<LD>   Her carefully lighted, meticulously posed images of Greta Garbo
and Joan Crawford, Ramon Novarro and John Gilbert were reprinted
countless times, uncredited. Now a University of California Press
book and a traveling exhibition are trying to go Parsons one better
and make Louise as famous as her subjects.</LD>
<TE>   The photographer's champions are Robert Dance, an Old Masters
dealer, and art historian Bruce Robertson, the authors of the book
and curators of the show. Today they are gathered in Robertson's
office at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where he is a curator
of American art, to talk about their fascination with someone they
consider one of the most influential women photographers of the
century.</TE>
<TE>   Classmates from Yale University, Dance and Robertson have remained
friends for more than two decades, and easily take turns talking.
This familiarity must have helped in their bicoastal
collaboration--Dance is based in New York, Robertson in Santa Barbara
and Los Angeles. "We were like Gilbert &amp; Sullivan," Dance says.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years ago, Dance, who collects photographs, came upon a
vintage 11-by-14-inch print of Garbo at the Lee Whitkin Gallery in
New York. On the back was a stamp that credited it to Ruth Harriet
Louise, but neither Whitkin nor Dance knew anything about her. Dance
was intrigued; he bought the photo and through the years picked up
other samples of her work. Robertson, who teaches art history at UC
Santa Barbara in addition to his work at LACMA, caught the bug from
him and started collecting Louise prints as well.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Dance's Louise research was just a hobby. Then, in
1994, Louise was included in Naomi Rosenblum's landmark book,
"History of Women Photographers." Dance's print of the Garbo
photograph went on exhibit in a related show. When the show arrived
at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art in 1996, Dance took the occasion
to suggest to Karen Sinsheimer, the museum's curator of photography,
that Louise would make a good subject for an exhibition. Sinsheimer
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Louise created a new way of making a portrait," Sinsheimer says.
"She wasn't credited with that because her career was so short, but
she really set the pace for what came afterwards. She used fabulous
fabric, pattern, and design in her work, and she framed things very
tightly."</TE>
<TE>   Dance and Robertson put together a proposal for the project. When
they started their research, all they knew was that Louise had been
an MGM photographer in the mid- to late-1920s. They wanted to fill
out her biography and uncover as many examples of her work as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Dance on the East Coast and Robertson on the West Coast scoured
photo archives, libraries, and public and private collections for
photos, and interviewed everyone they could find with a connection to
Louise in those years.</TE>
<TE>   At the MGM archives of the Margaret Herrick Library at the Academy
of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles, they unearthed a
treasure trove of material. First, Robertson found two scrapbooks
Louise had kept; they were filled with clippings from publications
that had used her work. Then, on a visit with Dance, they asked for
the files of six all-but-forgotten actors working at the studio
during Louise's tenure. They got back piles of photographs, most of
them credited to Louise.</TE>
<TE>   Later, after patiently going through microfiche and periodical
collections, they found articles that mentioned her, and realized
that not only had she worked at MGM, she had been the head of its
portrait studio. Little by little, the story emerged.</TE>
<TE>   Born Ruth Goldstein in New York in 1903, Louise was the child of
European emigres. She grew up in New Jersey, and in 1922 her older
brother, Mark Rex Goldstein, went to Hollywood, starting as a prop
boy and working his way up to writer and then director. Under the
name Mark Sandrich, Louise's brother would go on to direct the
Astaire and Rogers classics "Top Hat" and "Carefree."</TE>
<TE>   Back home, his sister had apprenticed herself to a New York
photographer, probably Nickolas Muray, set up her own studio in New
Brunswick, N.J. and adopted her professional name. By 1925 she also
headed west. She made her move then, Robertson explains, "because her
brother had just married, she could be properly chaperoned."</TE>
<TE>   She was hired by MGM that summer, possibly through her connection
to Carmel Myers, Louise's cousin and a bit actress in "Ben-Hur"
(1925). MGM was churning out silent films at breakneck speed,
completing a feature film a week, and it needed a steady stream of
portraits to promote new releases, new actors, new looks--as well as
to provide the photos sent out to fans--some stars received 10,000
fan letters a month, most of them requesting pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Louise had a studio on the MGM lot in Culver City, and
sitters--mostly actors, but also directors and writers--would report
to her throughout the day. From their research, Dance and Robertson
conclude that in her studio, she was in charge, determining the
lighting, the props and the pose. Once in awhile she would venture
"candid" shots outside the studio--Marion Davies on a diving board or
John Gilbert at home.</TE>
<TE>   Her portraits were captured on 8-by-10 negatives, although the
type of camera is unknown. Pictures that made the cut were enlarged
as 11-by-14 master prints that were made available as cover shots for
publication or were copied again and reduced back to 8-by-10 for
wider distribution.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition includes 80 photographs, borrowed from some 30
lenders, with several from the Santa Barbara Museum's own collection.
The great majority of these are the 11-by-14 originals printed under
Louise's supervision and possibly by her own hand. There are also two
vitrines of ephemera--fan magazines, music sheets, souvenir books and
so on--that made use of still photographs, either directly or as
models for illustrations.</TE>
<TE>   The pictures that Dance and Robertson found most striking are of
women, which is not surprising. Female stars drove the box office
and, as Sinsheimer says, "it does seem her real forte were
[actresses]. She really wanted them to look their best."</TE>
<TE>   There is a picture of a hopeful, Patricia Avery, decked out in an
Easter Bunny suit, probably as a seasonal promotion. There is Lillian
Gish demure as Hester Prynne in "The Scarlet Letter." But mostly
there are glamorous shots of starlet after starlet, including Garbo
and Joan Crawford, so young they barely look like the icons we know.</TE>
<TE>   Louise was pretty glamorous herself--as evidenced by a couple of
photographs in the show. This is corroborated by a 1928 Screenland
article: "If you saw her walking across the lot you'd think that she
was a star going from one set to the other. She is as pretty as a
star but instead of being one of them she bosses them!"</TE>
<TE>   As precipitously as Louise's career rose, it fell. By the end of
1929, she was gone from MGM, to be replaced by the legendary George
Hurrell. The book suggests that Norma Shearer, who was married to MGM
production chief Irving Thalberg, preferred Hurrell for the sexy way
he could photograph her--and had Louise replaced.</TE>
<TE>   However, Dance and Robertson also cite burnout. "You worked like
crazy because you were creating this incredible thing," Robertson
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Louise was being paid we figured $50 a week," Dance says, "a huge
amount of money when the average income was around $10."</TE>
<TE>   "There are many reasons why her job ended, and I'm sure that one
of them was that she was tired," Robertson says. She was also married
by then and on her way to raising a family. She had two children
before her death in 1940, at age 37, from complications of
childbirth.</TE>
<TE>   "The surprise to me was that from the day she started, she was a
fully formed, mature photographer," Dance says. "In the earliest
photographs she already had it. She did become more clever, more
inventive."</TE>
<TE>   "She develops a simpler, bolder composition as time goes on,"
Robertson says. "You see that with the sequence of Garbo or Crawford
photographs." Going through the book, he points to the pared-down
drama of some of the later portraits--as in a 1927 portrait of Garbo.
Here the silver-screen goddess emerges out of darkness, with her
smoldering eyes uplifted and her firm-set jaw raised. She's wearing
naught but a black dress, with one shoulder exposed. It is a look
that would not be too out of place in a fashion magazine today, more
than 70 years later.</TE>
<TE>   "She was really photographing the modern woman," Sinsheimer says,
"and she was the modern woman."</TE>

<DH>Andrew Lloyd Webber turns the music over to an Indian
composer for his latest stage spectacular</DH>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>"Musical theater can't just go on and on being revivals and
compilation shows," Andrew Lloyd Webber muses. "I've long thought
there must be something else--something that would unlock a new,
younger audience for musicals."</LD>
<LD>   Whether you like his work or not, Lloyd Webber has been the most
commercially significant name in musical theater for the last three
decades. And wouldn't you know that he might just be the one to have
found that elusive something new?</LD>
<LD>   His new show, "Bombay Dreams," opened here in mid-June at the
cavernous 1,900-seat Apollo Victoria Theatre, replacing "Starlight
Express," another Lloyd Webber show. The "Starlight Express" cast
finally roller-skated its way out of the Apollo in January, after an
astonishing run of almost 18 years.</LD>
<TE>   "Bombay Dreams" is a very different kind of Lloyd Webber show,
mainly because Lloyd Webber wrote not a single note of its music. Its
composer, AR Rahman, is a legend in India, where he has been
responsible for the soundtracks of some 50 films, including last
year's foreign-language Oscar nominee "Lagaan." Sales of his
soundtrack albums exceed 100 million worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   But "Bombay Dreams" is also crucially different in other respects.
Of its cast of 42, almost all are Anglo-Indian, "all except for a
couple of Malaysians," as Lloyd Webber puts it. Rahman's score
ensures a strong Indian music influence. The story is set in Bombay,
home to the most prolific film industry in the world--and that
includes Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   A visit to the Apollo Victoria in early July served to underscore
the differences. On this Tuesday night, the theater was completely
full: an achievement during this difficult period for London's West
End. But most startling was the constituency of the audience.
Slightly more than half were Anglo-Indian, and many among them were
young, sharply dressed and enthusiastic, applauding and cheering
wildly, with a few female screams reserved for the show's appealing
young male lead, Raza Jaffrey. This Asian audience is one the West
End has failed to attract in sizable numbers until now. (The British
usually use the word "Asian" to mean immigrants of Indian, Pakistani
and Bangladeshi descent who settled in the U.K. in the 1960s and
1970s, and their families.)</TE>
<TE>   "Intriguing, isn't it?" says Lloyd Webber, two days after that
performance. "When the show opened, the audience must have been 95%
Asian. There was a hurdle, and we didn't know how it would work out:
would the show happen with a white audience too? But it has, and
among the white audience, there's a lot of traditional theatergoers,
as well as younger people."</TE>
<TE>   "Bombay Dreams" is a boy-meets-girl story with Bollywood as a
backdrop. Akaash (Jaffrey) is a young boy from a Bombay slum who can
carry a tune. He realizes his ambition of becoming a Bollywood star,
but he also falls for a girl who seems beyond his reach: Priya
(Preeya Kalidas), the educated daughter of a wealthy film producer.
In the course of pursuing his true love, Akaash thwarts the Mafia
villains trying to demolish his slum and learns a lesson about not
forgetting one's humble roots.</TE>
<TE>   The book, written by Anglo-Asian novelist and comedy writer Meera
Syal, pokes gentle fun at Bollywood films and their odd conventions:
hammy acting, song-and-dance interludes unrelated to plot, modesty
about all things sexual. "Bombay Dreams" features extravagant
production numbers with gushing fountains and wet saris, silk-clad
dancers undulating in unison, even a Busby Berkeley-style routine in
a parade of beauty pageant contestants. The staging is amazingly
colorful, all oranges, purples and hot pinks.</TE>
<TE>   With a couple of harsh exceptions, reviews have been positive, or
at least tolerant. "A few critics have said we're helping reinvent
musicals," Lloyd Webber says happily. "And 'Bombay Dreams' has
received better reviews than either 'Cats' or 'Phantom of the Opera'
ever did."</TE>
<TE>   Indian reviewers have generally been less negative than some of
their British counterparts, according to Amit Roy, an Indian
journalist based in London. "The notices from the Indian critics were
mixed, but leaning toward the favorable. None of them was scathing."</TE>
<TE>   Some Indian critics, in fact, were wildly enthusiastic. Sanjay
Suri of the national Indian newsmagazine Outlook India, wrote of "the
dazzle that is at the heart of the musical" and affirmed that "Bombay
Dreams" works primarily as a spectacle</TE>
<TE>   It's timely that "Bombay Dreams" should be the first major Asian
musical to reach the West End, because in Britain this is an "Indian
summer," with this ancient, colorful Eastern culture making itself
felt everywhere from films to fashion. The major London department
store Selfridges dedicated itself to a celebration of Bollywood and
Indian design, fashion and food for three weeks in June. The Victoria
&amp; Albert Museum in London has a major exhibition of the enormous
Bollywood film billboards that dominate Bombay's streets. One of this
year's few runaway British film hits is "Bend It Like Beckham," about
a teenage Anglo-Asian girl in London who wants to be a soccer star.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Webber first became aware of Indian music five years ago,
when he found himself watching an Indian movie on British television
one Saturday morning. He was intrigued by one particular song, and
noted some superficial similarities between Indian and Celtic music,
with which he was deeply involved at the time. He was then working on
his last musical, "The Beautiful Game," set against the political
strife of Northern Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Webber forgot to note the song title but subsequently met
film director Shekhar Kapur, best known for "Elizabeth," starring
Cate Blanchett, and the Indian film "Bandit Queen." When Lloyd Webber
expressed an interest in Indian film music, Kapur volunteered to give
him videos of Bollywood films with outstanding soundtracks.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed to me that about one song in five or six had a gorgeous
melody as well as complex rhythms," Lloyd Webber recalls. "It soon
became clear that the common denominator to all these songs that I
really loved was the composer. And it was AR Rahman."</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Webber asked Kapur to set up a meeting between himself and
Rahman. He flew to Bombay, where Kapur organized a huge press
conference to proclaim Lloyd Webber's interest in Rahman's music. "I
went to meet him as a fan," Lloyd Webber says now. "It seemed to me
he might unlock that new audience in a way I couldn't--because people
see that I've written the music for a show and form preconceived
ideas."</TE>
<TE>   He asked Rahman if he would consider writing a musical; Rahman
agreed and flew to London. Only on this second visit, as they
strolled through the streets of London's theater district together,
did Lloyd Webber appreciate the magnitude of Rahman's stardom among
Britain's Asian population: "We walked 100 yards from my office to
the Palace Theatre, and I swear he had to sign 10 autographs on the
way. By the time we reached the stage door, it seemed most of the
Asian head waiters in Soho were there to greet us."</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Webber is very clear about Rahman's contribution to "Bombay
Dreams," and his own. "He would be the first to tell you that he has
only written for cinema. So, as a producer, what could I bring to the
party? I suppose 35 years of experience in theater. The melodies,
harmony, orchestration are all his, and his only. But it would be
disingenuous to say I didn't have a hand in the way the show is
constructed. I was able to show him, for instance, how you place a
song in the context of a book."</TE>
<TE>   Rahman wrote the songs with lyricist Don Black (who collaborated
with Lloyd Webber on "Sunset Boulevard" and "Aspects of Love"), and a
couple of songs written for the two leads would not sound out of
place in any Lloyd Webber musical. But for the most part, Rahman's
score bubbles rhythmically in a way quite new to Western musicals.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last 20 or 30 years since Tim Rice and I came along, there
have been no new writers for musicals who have stuck," Lloyd Webber
says. "Now I hope that by introducing AR to the theater, I might have
found such a writer."</TE>
<TE>   "Bombay Dreams" opened without much hype or expectation. As Lloyd
Webber points out, "It had no advance at all. Zero. Because no one
knew what it was." Yet only three weeks into its run, he became
convinced that the show had a genuine appeal for audiences of
non-Indian descent, and he could therefore begin thinking about North
America. Lloyd Webber has announced the show is sold through
September and is taking bookings through March, and he says advance
bookings, initially $200,000, have shot up to about $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been several offers in the last 10 days," he says. "So
now my casting people are meeting about this. But I have to make a
judgment about the best way of doing it. There are three main Asian
centers in North America with a reasonable number of Indian singers
and dancers. In order, they're Toronto, Los Angeles and New York. So
we might find it easiest to cast in Toronto. I'm determined to do it
with an Indian cast rather than, say, having Puerto Ricans doubling
for Indians."</TE>
<TE>   It's curious that at the very time when Lloyd Webber's
long-established musicals ("Cats," "Phantom of the Opera" and
"Starlight Express") are reaching the end of their long lives, having
represented the conservative norm for musicals, he is suddenly
emerging as something of an innovator.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled to have found a completely new audience," he says.
"The experience has made me rethink what I might write next myself.
And at this stage I really have no idea."</TE>

<HD>His Fusion Is Fresh</HD>
<DH>Andres Cabas' raw materials are the sounds of his native
Colombia, a land of cumbias, not cartels</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andres Cabas has been to the gym only once in his life. But on that
day, the young singer got a workout he'll never forget.</LD>
<LD>   It happened almost four years ago in his hometown of Bogota, the
Colombian capital. Cabas was still a virtual nobody in his native
country, a breeding ground for an acclaimed crop of international
stars such as Shakira, Juanes and Carlos Vives.</LD>
<LD>   Barely out of his teens, Cabas had already lost hope of attaining
pop stardom himself. The aspiring performer with the funny, frizzy
hair had made a demo of his songs and passed it around to record
labels in Colombia, leaving his dreams in the hands of front-desk
receptionists.</LD>
<TE>   When he got no response, Cabas became depressed. What's the use of
creating music from the heart if no one listens?</TE>
<TE>   The idea of going to the gym came from his friends. They said the
workout would counteract his doldrums. His body, long and lean as a
tube, didn't need the exercise. But it would help restore his
disillusioned soul.</TE>
<TE>   The dejected singer dragged himself down to the gimnasio, where he
struck up a conversation with a fellow exerciser. It turned out to be
Camilo Pumbo, an influential DJ, television host, music connoisseur
and mentor to young talent. Pumbo wanted to hear the kid's music.</TE>
<TE>   "I went running all the way back to my house to get the demo and
ran back to the gym to give it to him," recalls Cabas during an
interview in Los Angeles the day after the announcement last month of
his nomination for a Latin Grammy as best new artist. "That was the
extent of my workout, and I never went to the gym again."</TE>
<TE>   Pumbo invited Cabas to appear on his TV show "Esta Noche Si" (Yes,
Tonight), where he impressed the host so much that Pumbo became the
young artist's manager, offering the rest of the world a glimpse of
the talent he had discovered.</TE>
<TE>   The fresh music and uplifting spirit of that demo are contained in
Cabas' exceptional eponymous debut album, released earlier this year
in the U.S. on EMI Latin. His sound is a natural fusion of aggressive
rock guitars, jazz tonal touches and the traditional coastal rhythms
of Barranquilla, the Caribbean port city where he was born.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Caribbean is brimming with fusions, the Cabas brand
stands out for its boldness. It's an inspired, harmonious blend of
extreme elements--strident electric guitars with nostalgically
romantic melodies and obscure, undiluted folk forms. He uses not just
the well-known cumbia, but also the porro, fandango and the humble
bullerengue, a song form developed by women who were social outcasts,
the concubines and unwed mothers banned from the religious festivals
for St. John and St. Peter.</TE>
<TE>   In the Latin music industry, artists often water down their
identities to reach international audiences. But Cabas is not afraid
to be himself. His songs are like a collection of personal letters
with a compelling point of view. They are full of humor, sharp
satire, a torrid sensuality and an irrepressible optimism in the face
of his nation's terrifying social unrest.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my record is a record that transports you," says Cabas
over lunch at a Miracle Mile restaurant across from his label's
offices on Wilshire Boulevard. "At least, I feel transported by the
music I make, and I feel that people who hear it let themselves be
transported too."</TE>
<TE>   To where?</TE>
<TE>   "To the real Colombia," Cabas says.</TE>
<TE>   Cabas does not look like the TV stereotype of a Colombian. His
skin is far more pale than the glowing, milky chocolate complexion in
his album cover photo. He wears tight, hip-hugging jeans with
bell-bottoms, a '70s throwback that seems to be popular with
Colombian musicians. (Juanes, the singer-songwriter who swept last
year's Latin Grammy nominations, had that retro look before his
recent pop star make-over.)</TE>
<TE>   His features are ethnically ambiguous, like those composite
drawings of a face containing elements of all races. But his look is
slightly comical, especially with that unruly head of electrified
hair, a cross between Don King and Carrot Top.</TE>
<TE>   Cabas may be instantly recognizable now in Colombia, where his
album became a bestseller and everybody's singing his hits, "Mi
Bombon" and "Ana Maria." But in Los Angeles, he's still a virtual
nobody who's not even allowed to pose for pictures in the lobby of
the building where his label is housed. A young Latina security guard
puts an end to the newspaper photo shoot as if she was evicting a
vagrant. You can't imagine her doing that if Enrique Iglesias had
been there. (Cabas' CD has sold less than 5,000 units in the U.S.,
according to Nielsen SoundScan.)</TE>
<TE>   The singer takes it in stride and finishes posing outside. His
main concern is appearing in the picture wearing a Strokes T-shirt.
He worries, for a second, that maybe his label wouldn't appreciate
the plug for a band on a different record company.</TE>
<TE>   Cabas has an enormous appetite for music of all kinds. During
lunch--he orders a medley of colorful vegetables that he obviously
relishes and repeatedly praises--the 24-year-old cites an array of
eclectic influences, from jazz pianist Oscar Peterson to alt-rockers
Jane's Addiction.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in the '80s, he and his friends were "like a cult" of
fans who thrived on finding good music and hating anything
commercial. When Cabas was flunking math, he got a tutor who
introduced him to even more great bands. Instead of studying algebra,
student and teacher would listen to cassettes of the Cure and Pink
Floyd.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Cabas raves about the White Stripes and the Vines, two
critically acclaimed new rock bands. He likes the way their music
comes across so directly, Cabas says, free of over-production and
studio tinkering that get between the artist and the listener.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, he says, you can think a song to death. He still
prefers the early, raw renditions of two songs from his new album,
the demo versions of "Tu Boca" (Your Mouth), which has caused a
controversy for its video's lesbian kissing scene, and "Colombia
Tierra Querida" (Colombia, Beloved Land).</TE>
<TE>   Asked why he favors the originals, Cabas, who has been speaking in
Spanish, instantly replies in English.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I believe in first takes."</TE>
<TE>   As a child, Cabas loved to play piano so much that he whiled away
the hours at the keyboard. He wasn't like the other kids who had to
be forced to practice.</TE>
<TE>   When young Cabas misbehaved, his punishment was no more piano.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Eduardo Cabas, was a well-known musician, DJ and
composer from Barranquilla. When young Cabas was still a toddler, the
family moved from the tropical coast to the Andean capital, where his
father took a job as producer and arranger for the Philips record
label, working with Claudia de Colombia and others.</TE>
<TE>   Young Cabas' childhood was immersed in music. His maternal
grandmother, Alicia Rosales, developed a series of books to teach
children to read through song, he recalls. During family gatherings,
everybody sang traditional boleros and danced cumbias.</TE>
<TE>   There came a time when the budding rocker considered his parents'
music old-fashioned, the universal teenage lament. But Cabas never
forgot how music would light up his living room.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps to witness those scenes while you're growing up," he
says. "Because at those moments, I could see how songs made my family
feel so emotional. I could see the effect music can have."</TE>
<TE>   Cabas went on to study classical piano at the Pontificia
Universidad Javeriana, a Catholic university in Bogota. He also
played with the school's jazz ensemble under the direction of Antonio
Arnedo, who was experimenting with fusions of Colombian folklore with
modern music.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he toured with a band called Maria Sabina, which set the
verses of Colombian poets to traditional rhythms. Cabas always
lingered with the percussionists, asking questions about the complex
patterns and their history.</TE>
<TE>   "Colombian music has an astounding nostalgia but is very festive
at the same time," he says. "That combination is like a magnet that
keeps pulling us back, like an umbilical chord that keeps us tied to
our origins."</TE>
<TE>   The artist bristles when he thinks of the stereotypes people have
of his country. They think everybody wears a bulletproof vest and is
somehow involved with drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombia he loves is never in the news. It's a place of
wonderful folk traditions and festivals, where groups of graceful
singers dance through the night holding candles and greet the dawn
with a chorus of harmonious voices.</TE>
<TE>   It's a place where music gives him goose bumps.</TE>
<TE>   Margott Morales, 22, a bright-eyed Mexican American, got a touch
of that magic when she heard a Cabas tune on the radio recently. The
Cal State Long Beach business student drove from Wilmington with her
mother to see the young artist perform at a Tower Records store in
Anaheim, the Friday night after the Latin Grammy announcements.</TE>
<TE>   "I just love the whole CD," said Morales, who plays mariachi
violin and loves to dance salsa. "I liked his music because it has a
lot of classical tones to it. And he's so down to earth."</TE>
<TE>   Before returning home to Colombia and a tour that would take him
to Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Spain, Cabas performed for perhaps a
dozen fans at the Tower store. He played piano and gave a new twist
to songs that must be like oldies to him by now.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he signed autographs, adding a drawing he had created
as a personal logo. It's a stick man made with thick brush strokes,
the arms and legs extending down like roots reaching for the ground.</TE>

<HD>He Sees Our Past Clearly</HD>
<DH>Charles Phoenix turns old slides into a show that reveals
an era's optimism</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since 1998, Charles Phoenix has made a modest living demonstrating a
seemingly impossible proposition: Pictures of other people's
vacations are not boring.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, his one-man show "God Bless Americana" resumed a
limited run at the Egyptian Theatre. During the 1 1/2-hour
"histo-tainment" lesson, Phoenix clicks through a deftly organized
array of castoff color slides portraying ordinary Americans during
the '50s and '60s. Many are now dead and most have no names, although
Phoenix may anoint one "Smiley" or christen another "Miss Yellow
Hat." Yet these anonymous characters, peering earnestly from the
backyards and amusement parks of mid-century America, have become
Phoenix's unwitting co-stars in a theatrical experience that has hit
home among nostalgic Angelenos.</LD>
<LD>   Living-room slide shows have been known to induce narcolepsy among
viewers not actually featured in the pictures. But at the "Americana"
shows, not only are audience members staying awake, they're paying
for the privilege and returning for more after intermission. "The
stigma is gone!" Phoenix booms, as he relaxes with an iced tea in the
living room of his Silver Lake apartment. "I'm showing people
something they're not able to get anywhere else."</LD>
<TE>   Slide show chic? Stranger things have happened.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix says a whole era's worth of artifacts has morphed from
trash to treasure simply through the passage of time. "There used to
be a stigma with vintage cars too," he says. "They used to be thought
of as low class. It took a while to age. In the '70s, the everyday
stuff was [regarded as] junk. It was common. And now, mid-century
vintage has a positive spin."</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix certainly favors the mid-century look in his home. A box
of Borax, circa 1947, sits on the stove. Walls are decorated with
thrift shop paintings and three of Phoenix's turquoise-and-yellow
portraits of Southern California coffee shops showcasing the quirky
space-age architectural style known as Googie. A chest of drawers
salvaged from downtown L.A.'s old Bullock's department store holds
vintage travel brochures, wrapping paper, matchbooks, swizzle sticks,
paint chips and hood ornaments. String dolls, toy cars and puppets of
mysterious provenance crowd a nearby knick-knack shelf. Even the
estate sale notebook Phoenix uses to scribble ideas for his show
looks like it was exhumed from some long-since-demolished office
building. And the chairs in the corner?</TE>
<TE>   They once belonged to Howard Hughes. "I have to keep flushing
through," Phoenix says. "I'm always trading up."</TE>
<TE>   The secret to "Americana's" success can be found in what the
39-year-old collector calls "the Room." Here, crammed inside cartons
and paper bags, are snapshots salvaged from thrift stores and flea
markets, or given to Phoenix by fans of the show, friends of friends
and anybody else who's heard about the guy who collects old slides.
"To sort, edit, categorize and catalog all this is completely
overwhelming," Phoenix admits. "I'm so devastated because I just lost
a slide--I cannot figure out what happened to Jayne Mansfield at a
dog show, 1959--it was unbelievable!"</TE>
<TE>   With roughly 100,000 more slides on hand, Phoenix will no doubt
recover.</TE>
<TE>   "But I could have 10 bazillion slides," he says, "and 99% of them
will be of mountains and dirt. Believe me, most collections are
pretty mediocre. It's really about quality rather than quantity."</TE>
<TE>   Stooped over an opaque, plexiglass-topped table, Phoenix quickly
edits the latest arrivals. Like a blackjack dealer whiffing through a
deck of cards, he divvies up 100 slides according to the film brand
information printed on their cardboard mounts. Then he eyes each
picture through a loupe. The first 12 flunk. "No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no .... This is a dud collection unfortunately," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking through these little windows into the past, it's so
interesting to see how it all shook out," he muses. "A hairstyle, a
building, a car, a mood even--how do we look at it now? How does the
image play today?"</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix holds up a photo of a family posed on the shoulder of a
road. "I can tell you right now, this image doesn't play too
well--it's not something we really care about. We want to see the
unique and the extraordinary and the ordinary all at the same time.
When I find something that's really unusual, my spirit soars. I have
so many slots in that carousel to fill, and you'd better make sure
that every one of those slides is a humdinger."</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix became smitten with retro at age 14. Growing up in
Ontario, he'd been cast in a community theater production of
"Oklahoma!"</TE>
<TE>   He needed a cowboy costume and walked into a thrift shop, where he
found chaps, spurs and a lifelong vocation. He's been looking back,
fondly, ever since. "I think that history entertains people, and if
you have a passion for something from the past, it nourishes you. I
could step outside this minute and see where we're at now. It's where
we've been--that's what I find fascinating."</TE>
<TE>   After high school, Phoenix moved to Los Angeles, studied at the
Fashion Institute of Design and briefly created retro-flavored
clothing. By the late '80s, he was earning his living as a
vintage-automobile dealer. In 1993, during a routine thrift store
visit, Phoenix happened across a blue box labeled "Trip across United
States--1957." Instantly taken with the color slides inside, Phoenix
bought a projector and presented an impromptu show in his living
room. "I just called some friends and said, 'Here's a few of the
things I found today.' They were completely transfixed by these
images, and I realized 'OK, it's not only me. Other people can tune
in too.' "</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix went public with his show in 1998 at the California Map
and Travel Center in West Los Angeles. Loosely organized as a
narrative about a cross-country trip around America, the program had
unexpected impact. "I thought it would be completely dead serious,"
Phoenix says. "I had no clue there was going to be humor involved. I
went through the first seven or eight shots and there was no
laughter. Then I came to this slide of a 1947 Chrysler crossing a
river, and as soon as I showed that, the whole audience started
laughing And I thought, 'If they want to laugh, OK, we can laugh.' "</TE>
<TE>   More gigs followed at bookstores, museums and performance spaces.
Then Phoenix compiled "Part 2," focusing on Southern California from
the late '40s through the early '60s. With his new partner,
Dutch-born nightclub promoter D.J. Haanraadts, handling the business,
Phoenix opened "God Bless Americana, Part 2: The Retro Slide Tour of
Southern California" at the Egyptian Theatre last November.</TE>
<TE>   "This town is not like Boston or Chicago," says Phoenix, who wrote
his first book, "Southern California in the '50s," three years ago,
and has since produced "Cruising the Pomona Valley 1930-1970" and a
book version of "God Bless Americana" published last spring. "The
reason why it's not like those places, and the reason why L.A.'s
history is so grossly misunderstood, is that our history is so short.
Therefore it's dismissed as being unimportant.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm seeing in these slides from the '40s and '50s," he
continues, "is what places looked like then. What did Sunset
Boulevard look like in 1948? The Brown Derby? We get to look through
that peephole into the past. You have to make the history as
entertaining as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Patrons of "Americana's" Southern California show will learn, for
example, that L.A. traffic lights used to be red or green only--no
yellow; that Bing Crosby tried to compete with Walt Disney by opening
a Santa Monica attraction called Pacific Ocean Park in 1959; that
Joan Crawford personally inspected the premises of the Hot Dog Show
in San Bernardino before ordering red hot and fries for her children;
and that fishermen used to catch trout in the San Gabriel River.</TE>
<TE>   Also documented are now-quaint pastimes including the Whittier
Soap Box Derby, the jalopy races in Culver City, and, of course,
Disneyland, back when Tomorrowland was promoted as "the World of
1987" and offered flying saucer rides. Individual portraits emblemize
the period with startling clarity. An Azusa playboy outfitted in
beret, sunglasses and bathrobe sits poolside surrounded by
immaculately arranged bongos, black dial-up phone and fifth of
bourbon. A boy forced to leave his pet monkey at home stands stiffly
at attention while attending a camp in Big Bear named "Tomorrow's Men
Today." Four little girls in Tarzana smile at the camera, identically
outfitted by their mother in homemade dresses.</TE>
<TE>   "The '50s and '60s was an underrated period in our history,"
Phoenix says. "It was a time of mass consumerism, mass productivity,
happy leisure lives for a lot of people. And there's one big giant
difference between now and then--we were dreaming of the future.
Tomorrow was going to be a better day, and that is what we don't have
now in our culture--we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.
Back then, everything's going to be just fine and dandy. They were
selling the futurelike the cars with the big tail fins. Of course,
they're not going to take you to the moon, but you can at least have
a vehicle that makes it look like you're going there. I love the
optimism more than anything."</TE>
<TE>   "Americana" is staged in a theater, but the show has few elements
associated with a conventional theatrical production. There's no
director. Except for roller-rink organ music played during
intermission, there's no musical accompaniment or sound effects. The
show has a beginning, middle and end, but no real dramatic conflict.
And while Phoenix has a mellifluous, radio announcer-like voice, he's
never studied acting or gotten around to writing a formal script.</TE>
<TE>   When narrating his show, Phoenix often wrings humor from an image
by gently mocking the characters' seemingly bizarre choices in cars,
weaponry or bathing suits. But his commentary is grounded in
documented fact. Phoenix, it turns out, is nearly as obsessive in his
research as he is in collecting.</TE>
<TE>   "Vintage slides come to me in many different ways," he says. "Some
are shipped in a bag and meticulously documented. A lot of times the
slides are a complete jumble. I then have to play detective when I
look at a collection."</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix conducts research on the Internet, but he also gets
information from old brochures, postcards, magazines and books.</TE>
<TE>   "You can tell if I make up a name--Miss Bobby Sox or whatever--but
I tell the truth about the people," he says. "I couldn't honor these
people by making things up about them. Even though I don't have their
permission, because they're probably dead, I try to honor that person
in the picture, so I might laugh with somebody but never at
somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix plans more "Americana." He talks about curating a
holiday-themed show but would also like to explore edgier fare. "I'd
love to do 'The Dark Show,' " he says. "You know, people in coffins,
and I have slides from an airplane crash in Whittier in 1957. I want
to do dark stuff, but people don't want to see that. They only want
to see light, which is fine."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever shape his next show takes, Phoenix can be certain of one
thing: The slides just keep coming. "Tonight," Phoenix says, "I've
got a guy coming over here who told me his parents took pictures of
Walt Disney taking tickets on the Monorail in 1961. I'm dying to see
that."</TE>

<LD>I cannot recall reading a more mean-spirited article than Paul
Brownfield's slice-and-dice job on Danny Gans ("Las Vegas Loves
Who?," July 28).</LD>
<LD>   Almost everything about Gans seems to have ticked off Brownfield,
from Gans' religiously inspired lifestyle to the simpletons who
inexplicably enjoy his allegedly marginal talents. The result of all
this negativity is that I now really want to see a guy I'd never
heard of.</LD>

<TE>   Danny Gans' whining that he "was 36 hours away from the major
leagues" immediately reminded me of another entertainer who used to
tell his audiences that he was "just that far away"--Johnny Mathis.
The crooner liked to say that he had to give up a shot at the 1956
Olympics if he was going to make it as a singer.</TE>
<TE>   The record shows that Mathis was a fine high-jumper in college.
Period. His best wasn't even the best in his school, as he had a
teammate named Bill Russell who opted to play on the Olympic
basketball team rather than try out for the high-jump squad. Russell,
in fact, was world-ranked in the high jump in 1956 while Mathis was,
like Gans, another wannabe. But it sounds good to the audiences in
Las Vegas.</TE>

<LD>In Jan Breslauer's article ("Now on Stage: Un-Theater," July 28), Gil
Cates' reference to Marcel Marceau as being a "condiment for the
theatrical meal" is about as appropriate as calling Shakespeare a
good one-line man or describing Beethoven's work as great background
music for commercials.</LD>
<LD>   But then, since Cates' claim to fame is producing Oscar telecasts,
it's no wonder that he can't tell the difference between the gourmet
meal of an artist like Marcel Marceau and the fast-food tripe that
passes itself off as good theater in Los Angeles.</LD>

<HD>The Movie Buffs' Lament</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I couldn't agree more about the travesty that has become American
Movie Classics, and the only hope for old film buffs being Turner
Classic Movies and, sort of, Fox Movie Channel ("No Looking at You,
Kid," by Susan King, July 21). I used to like AMC and TCM equally.
They both showed old, uninterrupted movies, with the occasional logo,
and some variations that made each unique.</LD>
<LD>   Then it happened. AMC started to show its unending logo, and then
the commercials and then--well, I don't know because I haven't been
back since. I don't care what it shows now. I won't be seeing it. I
hope the advertisers know they are playing to fewer and fewer
eyeballs these days. Let them tell me what the substantial difference
is between seeing an old film on AMC and, say, TNT now (except TNT
doesn't have an unending logo). At least the FXM advertisements are
between the films, not during. And they have the sense to keep their
logo snipes to a minimum.</LD>
<LD>   I have to laugh at AMC Networks President Kate McEnroe's reliance
on focus groups.</LD>
<TE>   Ha! As someone who has worked in marketing and sales of motion
pictures for more than a dozen years, I know what focus groups mean.
Focus groups were "phenomenal" for Warner Bros.' "Wild Wild West." I
personally witnessed the "best numbers ever" from a national focus
group for Robin Williams' "Jack." Focus-group claptrap is used when
you don't have the knowledge of your audience and the convictions of
your heart and head about what you are doing, what you are selling
and to whom.</TE>
<TE>   I guess it's time to go back to AMC for one last time--to make a
list of the advertisers, so I can shoot off a letter to each and
every one, saying these eyeballs are elsewhere, permanently.</TE>

<TE>   I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with the leadership of AMC.
They have completely disavowed everything they claimed they were
going to do. I won't watch it anymore.</TE>
<TE>   I hope Turner Classic Movies drubs it in the ratings.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I hadn't realized how much I missed Turner Classic Movies from my
basic cable until last week, when I was vacationing in an area of the
Midwest where TCM remains part of the basic service, unlike some
systems in Los Angeles. Flipping onto it was like finding an old
friend, so you can bet I'm calling to get it back here at home.</TE>
<TE>   If I want interrupted, sanitized reruns of "Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid," "House of Wax" or "The Big Chill," I'll opt for AMC.
On second thought ... nah.</TE>

<TE>   Susan King expressed well the frustration of quite a few of us old
movie buffs. I used to tape AMC movies for my uncle, who does not
have access to cable. Now I am limited to TCM, which has much
higher-quality product, unadulterated with intrusive commercials and
boring "Backstories." One question for AMC bigwigs: How many times do
we have to watch "Escape From Alcatraz"?</TE>
<TE>   DON MUENZ</TE>
<TE>   Columbus, Ohio</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Susan King articulated what I have been feeling for months about
American Movie Classics. When AMC showed "Strange Invaders" from
1983, I knew it was not my imagination. This movie is not an American
movie classic. And the commercials--if I want that, I'll watch
network TV.</TE>
<TE>   It has totally changed in content and no longer shows the movies
from the '30s, '40s and '50s that the network purports to revere.</TE>
<TE>   They need to change the name of the channel to "Worst Movies of
the '80s ... With Commercials."</TE>
<TE>   PAT PARRISH</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Susan King's article on the direction American Movie Classics has
taken really struck a nerve. It's really annoying to watch a movie
expecting a remembered line or scene, only to find it has been
excised.</TE>
<TE>   AMC suffers too from looping, the practice of running the same
feature several times over a short period. For AMC: I just like to
watch movies as those who made them intended them to be seen. I
canceled that part of cable that brings in AMC and now just buy
videos. More expensive but far more enjoyable.</TE>

<HD>That's the Soul Truth</HD>
<DH>Truth Hurts joins R&amp;B with rap's cockiness. Fittingly,
she's on Dr. Dre's label.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not easy to coax rapmeister Dr. Dre out of the world of hip-hop
to work in R&amp;B or soul, fields that generally just aren't edgy enough
to interest him.</LD>
<LD>   But there is one thing that can change his mind: truth.</LD>
<LD>   That's what not only got Dre to offer singer-songwriter Shari
Watson a record deal, but also inspired him to give her a new
identity as Truth Hurts. Her debut album, "Truthfully Speaking," on
Dre's Aftermath label, includes tracks produced by Dre, DJ Quik, R.
Kelly, Focus, Hi-Tek and others. Dre also is the album's executive
producer.</LD>
<TE>   "Her personality, the way she came off, she was so real about
herself, so confident," Dre says. "I like listening to some R&amp;B, but
I don't like making it. But Truth was really open-minded about the
vision we had for her and was ready to do whatever we wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   If that sounds as if Watson was putty in Dre's hands, think again.</TE>
<TE>   Cooperative she may be. Mushy she's not.</TE>
<TE>   "When he first called me about the record deal, I was very
kick-back," Watson, 30, says. "Usually when he offers artists a deal,
they go crazy. It's not that I didn't feel that excitement, but when
he called it was 3 o'clock in the morning, on a Christmas Eve, and at
that point I felt I was done with the music industry, and I wasn't
sure it was something I wanted to get into again."</TE>
<TE>   In no small part that's because she's had enough experience in the
music industry to know what she wants and what she doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   She had flirted with success in the early '90s as part of the
hip-hop/R&amp;B duo Shug &amp; Dap, which put out a single, "Anotha Man,"
that began to attract attention just as its label, Giant Records,
folded.</TE>
<TE>   She took a job as a staff songwriter with Aftermath, but her role
changed after Dre heard her sing one of her songs that had been
targeted for another singer.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing about her was her flow--how fast she was in the
studio," Dre recalls. "I guess I could say that was a big part of it,
but singing the song better than the artist she was writing for at
the time, that's really what sparked me."</TE>
<TE>   She had turned down a couple of offers from major labels that
wanted her strictly as a singer before Dre signed her to Aftermath.
"I wasn't feeling those situations," says Watson, who grew up in St.
Louis and got an early look behind the scenes through her
concert-promoter father, who brought the Pointer Sisters, Phyllis
Hyman and others to the city.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by hanging around with musicians, she started singing
early, and her mother directed her to formal vocal training at
school. Watson studied opera through high school. She gave up a
partial scholarship at the University of Chicago when she and a
friend got the offer to record for Giant. "I didn't want to be just
any kind of artist," she says. "I wanted to be able to say and write
what I felt, and offer something different."</TE>
<TE>   That she has done in several songs on "Truthfully Speaking," which
recently debuted at No. 5 on the national sales chart. In addition to
the DJ Quik-produced single "Addictive"--a self-descriptive track
with a Middle Eastern vibe that pairs her with rapper Rakim--she
displays a take-no-prisoners assertiveness in "Jimmy" (in which she
fields a collect call from an imprisoned lover), the tough-talking
"Push Play" and "The Truth," expected to be the next single.
Throughout, she injects a rapper's cockiness into the soul singer's
musical milieu.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people are tired of not having real music," says Watson,
who moved to New York for a time and now lives in Los Angeles. "This
business is oversaturated with children, and people don't feel that
music. The only way real music is coming back to life is if we get
away from the attitude that you have to be this [young] age or you
have to look like this. Those barriers are slowly being broken."</TE>
<TE>   A single mother with a 6-year-old daughter, Watson says she
particularly aims to send positive messages to "single mothers, to
women who need strength, to young girls who need strength, to people
who need healing and to be free to be who they want to be, and not be
scared or be embarrassed at who they are."</TE>
<TE>   Her attitude and sassy vocals are getting noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I look at Truth Hurts is the way I looked at Grace Jones
back in the day," says Violet Brown, urban music buyer for the
Wherehouse record-store chain. "When she came out, she was different
from any other artist at the time. Her sound was different, she
appealed to the R&amp;B crowd, but also to the dance crowd, and I think
that's what Truth Hurts did with 'Addictive.' ... That [hit] has
really helped her, and I'm already starting to hear some other
copycats of that sound. Pairing her with Rakim was genius."</TE>
<TE>   That was a happy accident rather than a masterstroke of
design--"He just happened to be in the same studio the day we were
working on that song," Dre says, "heard what we were doing and said
he wouldn't mind being on it"--but he's already looking forward to
Watson's next album.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not taking anything from the record we made--this one's
definitely hot," he says. "I'd like to have had a little more time on
that one [and] I would have loved to have been a bigger part of it,
but that's how it goes. I definitely will be a bigger part of the
next one, now that we know exactly where we are going. I'm 100% sure
the next record is going to be twice as good."</TE>

<HD>When the News Makes News</HD>
<DH>Channels like CNN seem to draw more media coverage than
viewers. Hey, journalists tend to write about what they know.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here I am in my palatial Times cubicle, where I have been, off and
on, for the past 10 hours. During that stretch, millions of people
have watched playful banter on "Live With Regis and Kelly," torrid
affairs on "Days of Our Lives," uplifting stories on "Oprah," tongue
lashings on "Judge Judy," and trivia-obsessed nerds on "Jeopardy!"</LD>
<LD>   The TV has been on here too, albeit with the sound turned down
most of the time. Only it has never left CNN, which doesn't come
close to equaling the audience for any of those programs.</LD>
<LD>   Newspapers, not surprisingly, are preoccupied with news. Most
newsrooms in America have some combination of CNN, Fox News Channel,
MSNBC, Headline News or CNBC playing nonstop in the background--as
opposed to, say, daytime court shows, Cartoon Network or the Hallmark
Channel. Yet while that dial positioning makes perfect sense, it also
contributes to coverage of broadcast news and especially cable news
channels that seems excessive--or at least is disproportionate to
their percentage of the viewing pie.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, those aren't the only factors feeding a fascination
with TV news. Broadcast journalism offers its print counterparts a
mix of wealthy larger-than-life characters (just what makes Dan
Rather tick, anyway?), complex and compelling ethical issues (at what
point do you stop running the Inglewood police video?) and
bare-knuckled competition (Fox officials saying, in essence, "CNN
stinks, pass it on," and vice versa).</TE>
<TE>   It is, quite frankly, a head-scratching medium for us print folk:
impossible to ignore because of its influence and immediacy, but so
convoluted--and frequently compromised--by show business values that
it's easy to question how much real information is coming through.</TE>
<TE>   So TV news is interesting. It has all the elements of a good
story. Moreover, most major news operations are headquartered in New
York, the world's media capital, feeding discussion of the topic in
newspapers there that can't help but spill over elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the volume of coverage showered on these channels--even
before the events of Sept. 11--has consistently overshadowed more
widely viewed general entertainment networks, until I have begun to
wonder if all the fretting done over who's up and who's down amounts
to the media having a conversation with itself.</TE>
<TE>   Flipping through newspapers in recent weeks, it's hard not to
pause and ask if people out there are muttering, "Connie Chung? Gee,
why all the fuss?" "Phil Donahue? OK, so it's nice to see that he's
still ambulatory, but now what?" "Bill O'Reilly? It's certainly
entertaining to hear him rant, but why does he insist on referring to
his show portentously as 'The Factor,' and more important, does he
ever shut up?"</TE>
<TE>   Even "Nightline"--rightfully heralded as a national treasure after
ABC's poorly executed courtship of David Letterman clouded its
future--spurred a deluge of front-page coverage that, in hindsight,
is pretty impressive for a program watched nightly by less than half
the audience that tunes in for "That '70s Show," "According to Jim"
or "The Amazing Race."</TE>
<TE>   Just consider Nielsen Media Research ratings data for April
through June. Viewing of the news channels remained way up versus a
year ago, with ratings leader Fox more than doubling its prime-time
audience to 1.1 million viewers. CNN averaged nearly 900,000 viewers,
up almost 60% year to year.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC, also known as America's NewsChannel, experienced a more
modest gain during the second quarter, to 330,000 viewers--although
the channel did exceed 400,000 in July, thanks in part to Donahue's
much-ballyhooed return. Headline News reached 220,000 people on
average, while CNBC saw second-quarter ratings tumble along with the
stock market, losing more than a third of its audience to 225,000
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Putting the numbers in context, those five channels combined
averaged fewer than 3 million viewers in prime time--or less than a
third of the audience watching ABC, which can seemingly never have
its ratings mentioned without being preceded by the word
"beleaguered."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, that five-network total hovers below averages for the UPN
or WB networks. According to Nielsen, front-runner Fox News on its
own doesn't even equal tune-in for Pax TV, the seldom-talked-about
seventh broadcast network, whose prime-time menu--consisting of such
programs as "It's a Miracle" and reruns of "Diagnosis
Murder"--averaged roughly 1.3 million viewers last season.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a quick search of The Times this year--to use a near at
hand example that could easily be replicated at other
publications--found more references to CNN in the entertainment
section than sister Turner cable channels TBS, TNT and Cartoon
Network garnered together. For that matter, you can toss in Lifetime,
the most-watched basic cable network, and children's leader
Nickelodeon and still not match mentions of CNN.</TE>
<TE>   One could argue that this tilt stems in part from a heightened
interest in news since last year's terrorist attacks, but the trend
has held pretty firm going back the past several years.</TE>
<TE>   Part of this comes down to human nature. Journalists, like anyone
else, have an incentive to please their bosses, and bosses frequently
get ideas about things with which they have some familiarity. So
while it filters down to reporters that one of their editors saw
something on CNN or MSNBC that might merit coverage, it's much less
common for someone to pass along a similar note about more widely
seen offerings such as USA's "The Dead Zone" or MTV's "Sorority Life"
(although I can understand why editors might be reluctant in the
latter case even if they're watching it).</TE>
<TE>   News channels have also become more adept at catching the
attention of newsroom occupants, especially since they began tarting
up the screen with graphics and scrolling updates that run up, down
and sideways. The other day, for example, a colleague messaged me
wondering if I was watching "Larry King Live," where the on-screen
bulletin promised that actor John Schneider had a major secret to
reveal. Apparently, the big news was that the former "Dukes of
Hazzard" star was a fat kid, which, considering the buildup, came as
something of a letdown.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, I was minding my own business when this e-mail popped
up from someone on the copy desk: "There are so many graphic elements
going on around Connie Chung you can hardly see her." Another copy
editor proposed a story on the faceless people who compose the
idiotic text on Headline News, such as research indicating that
people who sleep less live longer, which the channel headlined, "You
Made Your Bed, Now Die in It." The Times published an
editor-suggested article late last year along similar lines,
wondering if the post-9/11 news crawls amounted to information
overload.</TE>
<TE>   These are good questions, to be sure, and journalists tend to be
curious types. But the truth is, relatively few people outside
newsrooms play CNN and Fox News as the video equivalent of elevator
music. If you stopped average people, in fact, depending on their
viewing habits they could probably come up with as many intriguing
queries about their own favorite channels, from Lifetime ("Why do all
these women fall for good-looking killers?") to Fox Sports West
("Don't any of these sportscasters speak in a normal voice?") to
Cartoon Network ("If Superman is invulnerable, how come Wonder Woman
just beat his brains in?").</TE>
<TE>   This isn't to say news channels don't deserve extra scrutiny.
Granted, their average audience is small, but millions of people drop
in on these channels from time to time, and their existence can play
a dramatic role in our lives, from influencing the political process
to helping stories feel alive and current and important--at least
until the next one comes along.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, it's worth taking a step back to consider whether
the press is overdoing it--that is, if the inordinate preoccupation
with every uptick in Chung's ratings and every tuck in Greta Van
Susteren's newly remastered face might be out of step with the vast
audience out there. Many people, after all, are more apt to watch
"Gladiator" for the umpteenth time, or even pro wrestling, than
thrill to see who Donahue is skewering, what mismatched opponent
O'Reilly is body-slamming or who's participating in Fox's nightly
tag-team event on "Hannity &amp; Colmes."</TE>
<TE>   Given what often passes for TV news these days, in fact, it might
be an interesting experiment to temporarily replace the news channels
by putting "Gladiator" and "WWE SmackDown!" on a continuous loop,
just to see if anybody in the newsroom notices.</TE>

<HD>Our Hero ... the Record Label Chief?</HD>
<DH>'24-Hour Party People' focuses on the non-musical man at
the heart of Manchester's scene.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN MAYNARD</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Joy Division, New Order, the Happy Mondays. You've probably heard of
the bands that came out of Manchester from the late '70s to the early
'90s. But you may not be familiar with their manager, Tony Wilson.
Just don't get him started about what the new film "24-Hour Party
People" is really about. As his character claims in the film,
speaking directly into the camera, Wilson's the first to tell you
it's not about him, it's about the music.</LD>
<LD>   "You know that bit where he says that in the movie?" Wilson asks.
The filmmakers listened to "me screaming at them in Liverpool and
they just put it in the film. I tried to make it more about the real
geniuses of the film, the real artists of the story. Like Ian
Curtis," the lead singer of Joy Division. "I tried very hard. But
then I realized it wasn't going to happen so I gave up."</LD>
<LD>   Like it or not, Wilson is the subject of "24-Hour Party People," a
sprawling, playfully postmodern movie from director Michael
Winterbottom ("The Claim," "Wonderland") that charts the trajectory
of the "Madchester" music scene from the birth of punk to the death
of acid house. It opens in Los Angeles on Aug. 16.</LD>
<TE>   When Winterbottom approached screenwriter and frequent
collaborator Frank Cottrell Boyce about making a film on the subject,
Boyce was enthusiastic, but they had to decide which of many stories
in the subculture they were going to tell.</TE>
<TE>   They eventually found themselves fascinated by Wilson, a
Cambridge-educated television reporter who had been relegated to
doing soft, human-interest segments--the film shows him reluctantly
hang-gliding and visiting elephants at the Manchester Zoo--but who
longed to make his artistic mark.</TE>
<TE>   He found that inspiration when he went to a Sex Pistols concert in
1976. It was the impetus to sign a group of talented post-punk
upstarts to his new avant-garde label, Factory Records, which put
Manchester on the alternative music map.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson and co-founder Alan Erasmus found inspiration for Factory
in the Situationist International, a libertarian collective that
argued for play at the expense of work. The music combined punk's
raw, do-it-yourself philosophy with the industrial sounds of reverb
and digital delay. Bands like Joy Division (which ironically and
controversially took its name from Hitler's grouping of young women
kept to pleasure Nazi soldiers) and A Certain Ratio produced music
that was emotional and intellectual at the same time. In keeping with
the company's name, Factory's albums purposely looked like they came
off a conveyor belt, also invoking the processed art of Andy Warhol's
Factory. Stark images and plain fonts replaced the usual pictures of
band members striking poses.</TE>
<TE>   Factory almost came to a grinding halt with Joy Division frontman
Ian Curtis' suicide in 1980. But the label resurfaced when the band's
surviving members became New Order, a wildly successful group that
revolutionized dance music with the single "Blue Monday," the
biggest-selling 12-inch single of all time. Not content with regular
club nights, Wilson opened the Hacienda in 1982, a nightclub that
rivaled New York's Studio 54 as a mecca for partying. That
Bacchanalian spirit was best reflected by the Happy Mondays, a
soulful band that incorporated vocals, R&amp;B grooves and DJ mixing into
music that celebrated sex, drugs and tribal togetherness.</TE>
<TE>   "I liked the idea that you could do a music film and make the main
character the record company owner," Winterbottom says. "Because he
would normally be the villain and it would be about the tortured
artist who gets ripped off by the record company. Whereas Factory was
completely mad and never made money and was always too chaotic to get
anything organized."</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to capture some of the anarchic feeling of the era,
Winterbottom shot the movie on digital video, putting radio
microphones on the actors and letting them improvise their way
through scenes. The cameras are smaller and require little or no
extra lighting, so the process is less intrusive and goes more
quickly. "If you're gonna make a film about Factory Records, it has
to be in the same spirit as Factory Records," the director says. "So
the idea was to make it seem very careless to capture that freedom.
So the actors could really go anywhere and do anything and the camera
can follow them. If you're trying to capture something like a concert
or a club, it's really much easier to do it that way rather than
stage it shot by shot."</TE>
<TE>   However, to capture Factory's freewheeling days scene-for-scene,
the film had to be rooted in authenticity. Winterbottom and Boyce's
process took five years, which included interviewing musicians,
producers, journalists and roadies from the era. In addition to Tony
Wilson, the film enlisted such technical consultants as New Order's
Barney Sumner and Peter Hook, A Certain Ratio guitarist Martin
Moscrop and DJ Dave Haslam. There are also cameos by Paul Ryder from
the Happy Mondays, the Buzzcocks' Howard Devoto, Clint Boon of
Inspiral Carpets and Mark E. Smith, frontman for the Fall.</TE>
<TE>   It was also a natural fit for comedian Steve Coogan to play
Wilson. Not only was he born and raised in Manchester and not only
did he have a brother who played in the Mock Turtles, a
one-hit-wonder band that was regularly booked at the Hacienda, he
even performed there himself. "I did a stand-up comedy gig there in
'86," he says. "I was just 21. This was in the trough after post-punk
and before Madchester and all the DJ culture when they didn't know
what the hell to do with the Hacienda so they tried stand-up comics.
It didn't really work out. I got a glass thrown at me, which luckily
missed."</TE>
<TE>   For a time, Coogan even did a Tony Wilson impression in his act
and, in 1989, both men appeared on "Up Front," a local public affairs
debate show. "He was the serious journalist and I was the guy who
made jokes about the week's news," Coogan says. Less than a decade
later, Coogan became a celebrity on the BBC with his creation of the
character Alan Partridge, a brilliantly stupid sportscaster with a
messy career and even messier personal life.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Wilson had some trepidation about Coogan playing him
because of his television persona. "He's enormously popular in
England," Wilson says. "He's like Eddie Murphy. And we were like, the
audience is gonna go, 'Wait a minute. This is a local TV presenter
and Alan Partridge by Steve Coogan is a local TV presenter.' " But
eventually Wilson got used to the idea and even enjoyed a cheerfully
antagonistic friendship with the actor. "He wears designer clothes,"
Coogan says. "I remember one time he came to the set and I was
dressed virtually identical to him. Black suit, white shirt and
sneakers. And he just stared at me and said, 'Oh, this is freaking me
out.' And I shouted back, 'You can have the suits afterward but
you'll have to let the waists out.' "</TE>
<TE>   For all of Wilson's intelligence and enthusiasm, success eluded
him on the scale of, say, Beatles manager Brian Epstein. Factory
Records and the Hacienda were run less as a mini-empire than as a
wild kingdom, with Wilson playing den mother to a brood of
dysfunctional children ranging from Curtis to the Ecstasy-binging,
gun-toting Ryder brothers of the Happy Mondays. The company wasted
millions of dollars on excesses like Shaun Ryder's crack binge in
Barbados, where the Mondays were supposedly working on their third
album, and never turned an actual profit. Famously, the only
documentation kept in Factory Records office was a framed,
expletive-laden contract Wilson signed in blood. "We actually lost
that one sheet of paper in the early '80s," says an amused Wilson.
"We discovered it again in the late '80s. When PolyGram bought us,
our lawyers were like, 'Do you realize if you have a contract that
says we own nothing and they own everything, then you have nothing!
And we all went, 'Oh, right. Sorry.' "</TE>
<TE>   Depending on whom you talk to, Manchester locals consider him a
cult hero or a complete meathead. It's become a citywide pastime to
love, hate or love to hate the 52-year-old man who's still peddling
TV fluff like "Top Ranker," a sports-quiz show. ("He thinks they call
it that so everyone could shout at him 'Top Wanker,' " Winterbottom
says.)</TE>
<TE>   Yet he's also still dedicated to breaking important new bands with
In the City, an annual British music conference he runs with his
third wife, Yvette. "I am not a genius. I mean I do nothing. I can't
sing, I can't program music, I can't design clubs. I'm a journalist,"
Wilson says.</TE>
<TE>   "My talent is my passion to hang out with geniuses. Before the
Mondays got famous, I remember walking into a backer's office and he
says, 'Look I've got a problem. They pulled out of an interview
today. They hit the journalist. We just can't go on like this.' And I
said, 'Sorry, I just really love that band.' My obsession is hanging
out with people that are cleverer than I am. And I've made a great
success of that."</TE>

<LD>"Remember 'The Agony and the Ecstasy'? Think of that--times 10."
Sculptor Simon Toparovsky is recounting the perils and thrills of
creating a life-size bronze crucifix for the Cathedral of Our Lady of
the Angels. Like author Irving Stone's interpretation of
Michelangelo's ordeal in the Sistine Chapel, the saga of adorning the
enormous new cathedral, which opens Sept. 3 in downtown Los Angeles,
is fraught with angst and drama.</LD>
<LD>   In this case, it's a tale of nine artists who were commissioned to
make artworks and furnishings for the $200-million complex designed
by Spanish architect Jose Rafael Moneo. Each artist's experience was
different, but they all faced considerable challenges. If they didn't
struggle to mesh their ideas with those of church authorities, they
wrestled with killer deadlines and technical obstacles.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just this mad 26 months, seven days a week, 10- or 12-hour
days--an insane amount of work," says John Nava. A figurative painter
based in Ojai, he made his first foray into weaving in a big way at
the cathedral--designing 620 square yards of tapestries that
encompass a procession of 135 saints, most of them 10 feet tall, a
baptismal scene that soars to 45 feet, and a smaller, abstract panel
behind the altar.</LD>
<TE>   Lita Albuquerque, a Los Angeles artist who designed a water wall,
circular fountain and star map for the threshold of the cathedral
plaza, says she got so bogged down in technical issues and building
delays that at one point she threw up her hands and fumed, "I'm not
in art; I'm in construction."</TE>
<TE>   Even Robert Graham, an L.A. sculptor who deflects most questions
about the 25-ton bronze doors he made for the cathedral, admits that
every aspect of the project was complicated. "It was all a daunting
effort," he says, when pressed to detail the process.</TE>
<TE>   But all the artists agree that they have been given an
extraordinary opportunity: their artworks installed at Moneo's
landmark cathedral. On view at the center of one of the world's
largest cities--in an increasingly distinguished cultural corridor
that encompasses Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall and Arata
Isozaki's Museum of Contemporary Art--their work will be seen by a
vast audience they can only imagine.</TE>
<TE>   Graham has completed major public pieces across the country,
including the Franklin D. Roosevelt memorial in Washington, D.C. But
the cathedral doors are by far his biggest hometown commission.</TE>
<TE>   Nava's tapestries have launched him into a sphere of expertise and
visibility that most figurative painters wouldn't even dream of.</TE>
<TE>   For other artists, such as woodworker Jeff Tortorelli, who
specializes in liturgical art at his in La Verne studio, work at the
cathedral is "an incredible blessing." His commission--including the
cathedra, the bishop's chair near the altar; and a height-adjustable
ambo, or pulpit--will allow him to continue, he says, "the kind of
work I do. It's going to give me recognition in this field and
hopefully open up doors to different parts of the country."</TE>
<TE>   "This is the thing that you come through your whole life to do,"
says Los Angeles-based sculptor M.L. Snowden, who made a wreath of
gold angels that wraps around the cylindrical base of the massive
central stone altar.</TE>
<TE>   The process of choosing the artists and orchestrating their
projects was the task of the archdiocese's art consultant, Father
Richard S. Vosko. A priest and scholar of religion, art, architecture
and adult education who lives in Clifton Park, N.Y., Vosko has
fashioned an unusual professional niche for himself. His business
cards identify him as a "designer and consultant for worship
environments." During the past two decades, he has written
extensively about sacred space and worked on dozens of churches, but
Our Lady of the Angels is by far his biggest job to date.</TE>
<TE>   It began in the spring of 1997 with a call from Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony, inviting him to create a master plan and oversee delivery for
all art furnishings and appointments in the cathedral building and
plaza. The first phase of the project, to be completed before the
opening, was budgeted at $6 million. The money was to be raised from
donors, some of whom earmarked their contributions for specific
works.</TE>
<TE>   Vosko began his tenure by heading off to Madrid for a weeklong
visit with Moneo, long after the building design had been approved.
The goal was "to get a glimpse of Moneo's vision and to share with
him the liturgical requirements of the space," Vosko says. "It is one
thing to create a beautiful cathedral building, but one must not
forget the primary function of the whole operation. The cathedral
primarily exists to offer people a place to worship God and be
educated, and to reach out to people who are hungry and homeless.
That's really the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Like many architects, Moneo--who couldn't be reached for
comment--might prefer that his building be unadorned by art. And like
artists everywhere, those who eventually won cathedral commissions
thrive on developing their own ideas.</TE>
<TE>   But, as Vosko says, "you can't do that with a religious project."
That means "you are stuck with a bit of tension." Part of his
strategy for resolving differences was "to get to know the artists,
find out what makes them tick and share with them the mythology and
significance of the theology and Scriptures" they were asked to
interpret.</TE>
<TE>   But first there had to be a master plan. Drawing from Scripture,
mythology and theology, and working with ideas that had been
discussed within the archdiocese but hadn't been assembled in what
Vosko calls "a nice big picture," he presented the first draft to
Mahony in late 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "It served as a blueprint and began to articulate a theme, or
story board, for the entire project," he says. The central
ideas--already established by Moneo and Mahony--concerned concepts of
light and pilgrimage. The cathedral building was seen as a radiant
receptacle and dispenser of light; those who come there would take a
journey of fulfillment, or pilgrimage, as they walked through its
exterior spaces and proceeded through its doors into the ambulatory
and nave. At specific points along the way, liturgical artworks and
furnishings would enhance the experience.</TE>
<TE>   Artists had begun inquiring about possible commissions several
years before Vosko was hired. After his arrival, the list of
contenders grew much longer--to several hundred names, although no
one seems to know the total number. Vosko thought Southern California
artists should be included. Being new to the area, he asked the
archdiocese to assemble an arts-and-furnishings advisory committee.
Its members--including Msgr. Kevin Kostelnik, pastor of the new
cathedral; Daniel Donohue, president of the Dan Murphy Foundation, an
L.A.-based Catholic service organization that contributed $25 million
to the cathedral; and Mission Hills folk artist Lalo Garcia, who
would be commissioned to create an outdoor shrine to Our Lady of
Guadalupe for the plaza--helped him draw up the list of candidates
and guide the project's development.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony was intimately involved with the process. Moneo attended
some sessions with the artists as their projects developed, but they
had little--if any--interaction with him.</TE>
<TE>   Artists were invited to submit portfolios in the spring of 1998.
"We spent the better part of a year sifting through all the
possibilities, then created a short list and invited people to submit
proposals for specific projects," Vosko says.</TE>
<TE>   Being a member of the Roman Catholic Church was not a requirement.
While several of the commissioned artists were raised as Catholics,
few are actively involved in the church. Johnny Bear Contreras, a
member of the Kumeyaay tribe who lives on the San Pasqual reservation
east of Escondido and has created a bronze memorial to Native
Americans for the plaza, has a Catholic background but now practices
his tribal traditions. He doesn't think the distinction is important:
"We are all under one umbrella."</TE>
<TE>   Sculptor Max De Moss, who made candleholders and a towering
receptacle for consecrated bread and wine, is a member of a Greek
Orthodox family. Toparovsky was raised as a devout Jew, but says that
his work focuses on the human condition and that his attitude toward
religion is wide open.</TE>
<TE>   "I would give credit to the committee for not making a fuss about
this," Toparovsky says. "It didn't seem to be a problem."</TE>
<TE>   The point, Vosko says, was "to find artists who know how to make
good art," not to screen them for religious affiliation. "There's a
lot of religious art out there," he says, "but it's god-awful stuff."
The reason? "Churches have not been courting good artists."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the courtship was sometimes a high-stress affair.
Toparovsky submitted a portfolio of his work, as requested, but heard
nothing for two years. When he finally got a letter inviting him to
submit a proposal for the main altar crucifix, he was also told to
present his plan at a specific time and date. He was scheduled to be
in Italy then, installing a big project he had worked on for several
years. Vosko said the meeting couldn't be postponed and advised him
to make a video.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked," he says. "I had never made a video, so I called
in every favor that I had in the entertainment industry. I even had
tutoring in voice-overs." Leaving nothing to chance, he also arranged
for a Beta video monitor to be delivered by a technician who would
set it up and adjust the volume.</TE>
<TE>   In sharp contrast, Snowden says her commission entailed technical
challenges but no other difficulties. Instead of presenting drawings
or models for the base of the altar, as might have been expected, she
made a full-scale frieze of steel and silver that laid out her
composition on a rectangular panel. The same configuration of four
airborne angels--in gold-plated bronze--now encircles the altar,
while the frieze hangs in the entry to cathedral offices.</TE>
<TE>   For other artists, being selected was only the beginning of a long
process as they worked with Vosko and the committee to carry out
established themes and conform to traditions while creating an
identity for the cathedral that would link it to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "This building has to tell the story of folks here," Vosko says.
"You've got a Spanish architect and there's a reference to
mission-style forms here. But what about the stories of the people
who actually live and worship here?"</TE>
<TE>   One of those stories will be told by Contreras, who says his
memorial, "Spirit of the Earth," grew out of "tons of meetings and
talks about spirituality and Native American traditions." The
sculpture--a man rising out of swirling water but still struggling
against enormous pressure--is based on a specific Kumeyaay creation
myth. But it also symbolizes all Native Americans' journey through
life and "the journey that takes place at the cathedral itself," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Tracking that journey in terms of artworks, Vosko begins with
Albuquerque's fountain and water wall, designed in collaboration with
architect Robert Kramer and located at the threshold of the plaza.
She was given several Scriptures and asked to base her work on the
one she chose. She settled on Jesus' request for a drink of water
from a Samaritan woman he encountered at a well. Mahony then
compressed the Scripture into the words "I shall give you living
water." Albuquerque had planned to inscribe a longer form of the
Scripture on the wall by the low, circular fountain. Instead, the
short version--translated into 37 languages spoken by cathedral
parishioners--will be sandblasted into a horizontal marble disk on
the fountain.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the wall and fountain that were requested, she
designed a star map for the surrounding pavement. The idea was
approved, but it won't be carried out until a later phase of the
project. Even then, it won't be quite what Albuquerque envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   She had hoped to design her own composition of constellations. But
in keeping with Catholic tradition, the map had to replicate the sky
at vespers the night before the cathedral is dedicated. A deep-blue
glass lining on a pond above the wall and a vertical glass piece
designed for the wall, to connect it visually with other components
of her work and Graham's doors, also have been postponed until money
is raised for the next phase of the master plan.</TE>
<TE>   Moving on through the plaza, Vosko proudly points out that
Garcia's ceramic tile shrine includes "faces of the children of Los
Angeles" as well as a large painting of Guadalupe. To be installed
nearby, Contreras' bronze "Spirit of the Earth" memorial is meant to
welcome Native Americans and honor their traditions.</TE>
<TE>   Then come Graham's massive doors. The artist says he got "a
30-by-30-foot hole" for his project, along with a directive from
Mahony to put Our Lady of the Angels on the doors. There were also
"some suggestions" as his design progressed. Most of them pertained
to his portrayal of Mary on the tympanum, a horizontal structure
above the doors, and multicultural religious symbols and
representations of the Virgin in the New World that appear in relief
on the lower part of the doors.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob had a lot of ideas for the Virgin," Vosko says of Graham. But
the initial ones were rejected, including a figure with the infant
Jesus at her breast. The version that won approval--a sturdy, simply
dressed figure with outstretched hands and a thick braid of hair--is
"a new vision of what this woman can be," Vosko says.</TE>
<TE>   Those who walk through Graham's doors will enter the south
ambulatory, with six chapels on the right side. One of them is a
separate room that houses De Moss' 10-foot-tall bronze and silver
tabernacle. A hinged structure composed of three towers, the
tabernacle is intended to "provide a physical connection to the life,
death and resurrection of Christ," De Moss says. At the end of the
ambulatory is a 17th century Spanish Baroque retablo (see story, this
page), formerly lodged at a seminary in Mission Hills.</TE>
<TE>   In the central, soaring space of the cathedral, Nava was asked to
create "a communion of saints" for two facing walls. The idea was to
have a frieze of figures, representing real saints, to inspire
worshipers, he says. At first, the notion struck him as "kind of
bland," but the more he thought about it, the better it sounded.
"It's really the essential core idea of the church, the image of the
church as a body of people."</TE>
<TE>   Nava wanted the figures to look "completely believable and make a
real connection" to those who come to the cathedral. The solution was
to use real people--friends, members of his family and strangers
plucked off the streets of Ojai by Cyrena Hausman, a former casting
director--to portray the saints. He painted their portraits, hands
and feet as fast as possible and composed their robed bodies
digitally. With the help of Donald Farnsworth, a Bay Area artist
noted for art applications of digital technology, he assembled groups
of figures in digital form and e-mailed them to Flanders Tapestries,
a weaving studio in Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   To make the tapestries blend into the concrete walls, Nava
designed the backgrounds and robes with fresco-like textures. The
piece behind the altar, which is particularly subtle and appears to
be an abstraction, is composed of concentric circles overlaid on a
street map of downtown Los Angeles, including the site of the
cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   The specific saints depicted on the tapestries were selected by
the archdiocese's multicultural committee. Nava had hoped that a
large number, say 50 or 60, of the 135 figures would not be named, to
make the idea of sainthood less remote and suggest that anyone can
become a saint. The committee's list of saints kept growing, but he
included eight unnamed figures--four teenage boys in tennis shoes,
two little girls and a Japanese mother with her baby.</TE>
<TE>   The altar sits at the apex of the nave, with the bishop's chair
and pulpit nearby. Toparovsky's crucifix--to be installed on a pole
behind the altar, with the feet about 39 inches above the
floor--involves a single life-size figure, but it's weighted with
2,000 years of history and countless interpretations. Each member of
the cathedral art committee seemed to have a different idea of how
this particular crucifix should look. "I decided the only way I could
be successful was to transcend all of those limitations and just do
the best work I have ever done," the artist says.</TE>
<TE>   When Toparovsky began, Vosko suggested that he read the book "A
Doctor at Calvary," written in 1953 by Pierre Barbet, which describes
in clinical detail the ordeal of crucifixion and the brutal treatment
that preceded it. Toparovsky had envisioned a relatively
transcendent, sweet image. The book changed that, but he ultimately
decided that he didn't want to make a sculpture that would terrify
children. The result is a tortured Jesus whose skin is a mass of
abrasions and whose limbs are broken and swollen, but one who is not
violently distorted.</TE>
<TE>   As their works are finished and installed, the artists are
breathing easier and taking stock of their accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's odd to have done a major figurative project that is not
ironic," says Nava, musing on where his tapestries fit into art
history. "The figurative painters I admire take a pessimistic view.
This had to be entirely hopeful and life-affirming. It's tricky to do
that without Disneyfying the art or making it sentimental."</TE>
<TE>   As for Graham's monumental project, "I'm very proud of it," the
artist says. "But it doesn't have much to do with me anymore. I'm
happy to start letting it go."</TE>

<LD>The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels will open with commissioned
works by nine artists. But that is only the first phase of a master
plan to outfit the building with art appointments and specially
designed furnishings. As funds become available, several other
projects are expected to be added. The priority is yet to be
established and there is no deadline on these works. While some are
already assigned to artists who have developed designs, others have
not been commissioned. The archdiocese won't say how much money is
needed to jump-start these projects, but all are under consideration
as part of the master plan:</LD>
<LD>   * Another, smaller set of bronze doors, yet to be designed by
sculptor Robert Graham, for the cathedral's north entrance.</LD>
<LD>   * A star map on the plaza pavement by sculptor and installation
artist Lita Albuquerque, marking the position of the constellations
the night before the cathedral's opening, and some finishing touches
on Albuquerque's fountain and water wall.</LD>
<TE>   * A children's garden, with the theme of Noah's Ark portrayed in a
sculptural relief depicting a procession of animals by L.A. artist
Gwynn Murrill.</TE>
<TE>   * An outdoor labyrinth that symbolizes a pilgrimage to the Holy
Land.</TE>
<TE>   * Stations of the cross, to be installed on a garden wall or
carved on windows of the ambulatory that runs along the north side of
the nave.</TE>
<TE>   * A mural on the south ambulatory wall, telling the history of
Christianity in Southern California.</TE>

<HD>17th Century Altarpiece Is Given Pride of Place</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several historic artistic elements have found a new home among an
array of contemporary artworks and furnishings at the Cathedral of
Our Lady of the Angels. Stained glass windows and light fixtures that
formerly adorned St. Vibiana's Cathedral have been installed in the
mausoleum on the lower level. On the main floor, a 17th century
Spanish Baroque retablo will be prominently displayed at the end of
the south ambulatory.</LD>
<LD>   Measuring about 26 feet wide and 20 feet high, the elaborately
carved, polychromed and gilded altarpiece depicts a crucifix flanked
by saints, with a Madonna and child overhead. Made in 1692 for a
chapel in Ezcaray, a village in northern Spain, the retablo was sold
to a New York art dealer in 1924 to raise funds for the
then-impoverished village.</LD>
<LD>   The dealer offered the retablo to the archdiocese of Los Angeles
but eventually sold it to Pasadena art collector Raymond Gould. He
donated it to the archdiocese in 1934. The retablo was housed at a
seminary (now Bishop Alemany High School) in Mission Hills, until the
archdiocese decided to move it to the new cathedral. It was added to
the list of art works as a reminder of Catholic history.</LD>
<TE>   In preparation for its debut in downtown Los Angeles, the massive
altarpiece has been conserved by Griswold &amp; Associates, with
technical assistance, research services and $142,500 in financial
support from the J. Paul Getty Trust. Brian Considine, the Getty
Museum's conservator of decorative arts and sculpture, organized the
project.</TE>
<TE>   "What's remarkable about this retablo is its vitality," Considine
says. "It has undergone very little restoration, so it retains a very
fresh quality. We worked hard to honor that quality as we conserved
it."</TE>

<DH>At a festival, two companies, one radical and one
traditional, expand ideas about the dance</DH>

<LD>Get ready for another shakeup of what you think flamenco is.</LD>
<LD>   The annual Irvine Barclay New World Flamenco Festival, now in its
second year, has stated its intention to expand local audiences'
ideas about the dance form. For 2002, it is bringing two extreme
companies from Spain.</LD>
<LD>   Compania Juana Amaya and Compania Flamenca Andres Marin are, in
fact, exact opposites of each other, according to Yaelisa,
single-named and head of her own company in San Francisco as well as
artistic director of the festival. Amaya honors the past; Marin the
future, Yaelisa said. Her company, Caminos Flamencos, which will also
perform, represents a more middle ground.</LD>
<TE>   "Most of the young flamenco artists are trying to push the
envelope and trying to be innovative," Yaelisa explained, speaking
from company offices in San Francisco. "Juana Amaya is not. She goes
the other way. Her stand is, 'There's nothing wrong with flamenco. It
doesn't need all this other stuff.' She's in the vein of pure
traditional Gypsy-style flamenco. Her goal is to preserve that style.</TE>
<TE>   "Andres' whole bag is innovation, pushing the envelope and getting
a new way of movement that no male flamenco has moved in before. Many
people did not like his style. They felt it was not flamenco. He
didn't begin achieving acclaim in Spain until two years ago. Flamenco
is evolving, and if anyone is evolving it, he's the guy."</TE>
<TE>   Amaya, 28, was born into a Gypsy family in the village of Moron de
la Frontera, a cradle of Spanish flamenco. She learned to dance from
her uncles, cousins and close relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "That is typical of the Gypsy-style dancers," Yaelisa said. "Many
of them never took a class in flamenco in their life. They wouldn't
dream of it. Many have almost a disdain for training and technique
and studying. The style has a rawness and even brutality."</TE>
<TE>   "In Gypsy families, there are always people who dance or play the
guitar," Amaya told a German interviewer recently. "At the age of 6,
I already danced in a show."</TE>
<TE>   She was discovered by flamenco great Mario Maya, who made her a
featured dancer in several of his shows as soon as she turned 14. She
worked with him for three years, touring the world and performing in
venues ranging from Carnegie Hall in New York to the Carre Sylvia
Monfort Hall in Paris. She formed her own company in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Of her appearances that year in London, Mary Clark wrote in the
Guardian that Amaya "excels in the more tragic, introspective aspects
of flamenco." Covering the same concert, John Percival wrote in the
London Times that Amaya "provides a broody, soulful note, but after
she has suffered touchingly through ... false endings, I am happy
that she summons up a flash of anger to fight back at the end against
whatever her cruel fate is supposed to be."</TE>
<TE>   She backtracked into big-show flamenco a bit however, dancing the
title role in a 1996 production of "Carmen" and in a 1999 production
of the opera "El Cid," both in Seville, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Of her Carmen, Jesus Vigorra wrote in El Correo de Andalucia,
"Juana Amaya does not need to fake her way through the interpretation
of Carmen. She is a woman of the people, a Gypsy and an artist."</TE>
<TE>   But she regards those performances as different from her own
dancing. "I made theater, but in theater companies," she said. "This
is yet another form of working. This is flamenco mixed with theater."</TE>
<TE>   She isn't opposed to experimentation, but she does believe in
truth in labeling.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't always go on like 100 years ago," she said. "But we
also have to respect what the flamenco is. Otherwise you can't call
it flamenco, call it 'flamenco-fusion' or something else. But don't
call something flamenco which isn't puro, puro."</TE>
<TE>   Marin, whose mother was a flamenco singer and whose father--after
whom he is named--a flamenco dancer, doesn't see himself as an
innovator so much as an independent artist.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what people, the critics, the press say," Marin said of
the label. He was speaking recently from Seville. "I have the
traditional training, and I go out on stage and do what I want to
do."</TE>
<TE>   So what's the controversy?</TE>
<TE>   "His movement style has been described in so many different ways
by people who don't like it or find it fascinating," Yaelisa said.
"He's toned it down recently. When I first saw him, he looked very
vampire-like and contorted. He would get into the strangest
positions--deep lunges, twists and contortions. Anti-flamenco. Or
rather, anti-stereotypical flamenco.</TE>
<TE>   "His posture, for instance, the effect is to round his back
forward instead of stretching the back and presenting the chest in a
very proud way. He goes to the other extreme. He doesn't believe in
it, doesn't like it, doesn't feel it."</TE>
<TE>   "In someone else, you may find more beauty, more technical
prowess, more diplomacy, however you will never find anyone like
him," wrote Agnes Benoist in the Lyon Figaro in January. "His
flexible body cuts through space like a bow--his stomach protruding a
little too much and his shoulders receding a little too far, leaving
any flamenco academy begging to correct his posture. He has a false
offhand manner that fails to hide his devoted passion."</TE>
<TE>   "I like dance that comes from the gut, that hurts," Marin once
told a Spanish interviewer. "I like real dancing."</TE>
<TE>   He also rubbed people the wrong way when he criticized what he
called commercial flamenco. "To do a movement which is preconceived
to please the audience, that's the worst thing. It doesn't reach me.
I like serious dance, straightforward dance. The rest is academic,
plastic, pretty. You sell it and make money, and there's never any
problem because everyone says, 'Ole.' "</TE>
<TE>   Since his debut in 1993, his style has been evolving. "I think of
dancing more minimally now, keeping the body more simple," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His "Mas Alla del Tiempo" (Beyond Time), which he will dance at
the festival, illustrates that by taking place within subtle squares
of light amid islands of semi-darkness. And then there's the music.
Instead of using only the guitars, songs and clapping hands of
traditional flamenco, he adds an otherworldly aura through Gregorian
chant, and accompaniment by violin, string bass, clarinet and
accordion.</TE>
<TE>   "Music is very personal to me and important," Marin said, "not
only listening, but breathing into what they're singing. If you sing
yourself, it's better. I never did it professionally, but I still
sing for myself."</TE>
<TE>   Spontaneity and improvisation are also important--a place where he
and Amaya are in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "Structure is important when you are in a big theater, where you
have to be aware of entrances and exits, but the more secure you are,
the more technique you have, the more spontaneous you can be," Marin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Marin seems to want to back off these days from some of his more
radical statements attacking flamenco artists in general as being
locked in the past and audiences as being more or less clueless.</TE>
<TE>   "There's absolutely nothing wrong with traditional flamenco," he
said. "If it's well done, it can be beautiful and it can be great.
But bad traditional flamenco is really bad.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people are so surprised by me anymore. People are
getting more and more open to new ideas, and also in the last five
years, so many other new dancers have been coming up, it's not only
me who is being different."</TE>
<TE>   Yaelisa and Caminos Flamencos, the third troupe in the festival,
fall between the other two groups.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't espouse just one philosophy or another," Yaelisa said. "I
like to do contemporary things. But in this show, 'Desde Cadiz Pa
Aca' [From Cadiz to Here], I'm looking into the past, at the golden
age of flamenco in the 1940s to the '60s, and trying to bring it to
life in the year 2002. It speaks to tradition, but it looks forward
too. I've gone back and forth that way in my interest in looking for
other avenues of expression and also wanting to keep this heritage
alive."</TE>
<TE>   Yaelisa said that she hopes the contrasts in this year's festival
have an impact.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, I didn't want to take too much of a risk the first
year, neither did the festival's producer, Douglas Rankin."</TE>
<TE>   But this year, the styles should do more to fulfill her goals: "I
wanted to not just present flamenco artists to Southern California,
but to show the gamut of styles that really exists in flamenco."</TE>

<HD>Hives' Signing Creates a Hornet's Nest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's been a lot of music business discussion about the Hives'
recent signing of a global deal with Universal Music U.K. They
spurned Warner Bros. Records just months after Warner had licensed
the Swedish band's recordings for North America.</LD>
<LD>   The most interesting parts of behind-the-scenes conversations
center on what fallout the move will have.</LD>
<LD>   Warner Bros. officials say they got rights to both the Hives'
current album, "Vini Vidi Vicious," and their as-yet-unrecorded next
album in their deal with Los Angeles-based independent Epitaph
Records. Epitaph made a deal in 1998 with Burning Heart Records in
the Hives' native Sweden to release the neo-garage band's music in
the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   Word from the Hives camp, though, is that the band believes it has
no further obligation to Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Expectations in the music business are that a settlement will be
arranged to resolve Warner Bros.' claim on the band before a new
album is made.</TE>
<TE>   That's been the standard course of action when acts have signed
with new companies while still under contract to another--such as
when Tom Petty left MCA for Warner Bros. in the early '90s and when
the Offspring exited Epitaph for Columbia Records in the mid-'90s.</TE>
<TE>   Legal action is likely in the Hives' case, and it could get
unusually complicated because the band's original contract with
Burning Heart is written in Swedish and any disputes may have to be
resolved in Swedish courts.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, it leaves Warner Bros. in a lame-duck situation. Sales
for "Vini Vidi Vicious" have slowed since its single-week peak of
20,000 copies in June but are still strong. (The album, originally
released by Epitaph nearly two years ago, has sold 176,000 copies in
the U.S. since Warner Bros. took the album over in April, and about
200,000 overall, according to Nielsen SoundScan figures.)</TE>
<TE>   Insiders say that Warner Bros., if nothing else, will continue to
support the album out of respect for its partnership in the venture
with Epitaph. Warner Bros. Chairman Tom Whalley, who had been the
driving force behind the Hives deal, has had a long friendship with
Epitaph head Brett Gurewitz.</TE>
<TE>   What the band plans as far as continued promotion of the current
album is unclear. British music executive Alan McGee, who has been
representing the Hives, did not respond to e-mail queries.</TE>
<TE>   The Hives situation also puts a spotlight on recent attempts at
creative deal making designed to make independent music work in
major-label contexts. The trend has been toward an increasing number
of short-term deals or licensing agreements with acts that have
established themselves outside of the major-label world.</TE>
<TE>   Other recent deals of note include the White Stripes' licensing
three existing albums and two future albums to V2 Records, and Bay
Area punk band AFI's three-album contract with DreamWorks Records.</TE>
<TE>   If Warner Bros. is left with less to show than it had anticipated
for its investment in the band thus far, will even major labels start
worrying about being treated as a steppingstone by indie bands on the
lookout for better deals somewhere else?</TE>
<TE>   Several music attorneys and label executives say the Hives' case,
in which the band had no input in negotiations that assigned it to
Epitaph or Warner Bros., is an anomaly.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hives is not the same situation," says attorney Ian Montone,
who represents the White Stripes and is a proponent of shorter-term
deals.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think this will make labels think it hurts to do
short-term deals," Montone says. "Shorter deals would simplify all
our lives."</TE>
<TE>   GRAY STRIPES: Jack White of the White Stripes is set to play a
small role as a Confederate Army deserter in the movie "Cold
Mountain," which will be directed by Anthony Minghella ("The English
Patient") from the novel by Charles Frazier.</TE>
<TE>   White's character will sing several Civil War-era songs, which he
recently recorded with soundtrack producer T Bone Burnett in
Nashville. Filming will take place in November in Romania, which will
double for the story's North Carolina setting.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Jack and drummer Meg White have finished their next
White Stripes album in England and after a few more U.S. concert
dates will take some time off before the record's release, which is
scheduled for February.</TE>
<TE>   BLUES CLUES: Chris Thomas King, who played Delta blues musician
Tommy Johnson in "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" and has continued with
the role in the related Down From the Mountain concerts, has two more
film appearances in the works. He'll be seen as musician Blind Willie
Johnson in director Wim Wenders' installment of the PBS series "The
Blues," airing in fall 2003.</TE>
<TE>   He's also signed up for a co-starring role in a movie being
developed for Miramax titled "Midnight Hour." The fictional tale of
two musician friends set in the '60s will be directed by Charles
Burnett.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans-based King is also putting the focus back on his own
music, which incorporates blues traditions and hip-hop elements.
"Dirty South Hip Hop Blues" will be released Oct. 8 by his own 21st
Century Blues Records, which he established after being on Sire
Records and BMG's Private Music in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Although the music is a far cry from what he's been doing in the
"O Brother" context, he believes the new and large audience that has
seen and heard him now will be receptive.</TE>
<TE>   "With the fans coming to the Down From the Mountain concerts,
we're a long way from the blues and bluegrass roots audience," he
says. "When you sell 8 million records, you're playing for fans of
Celine Dion and Britney Spears, so they won't be shocked by the
hip-hop blues. As far as the blues audience goes, those 5,000 people
who are blues purists might have heart attacks."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: While Ryan Adams was finishing and releasing last
year's acclaimed album "Gold," he was also busy recording several
dozen other songs in five recording sessions over 10 months. Thirteen
of those songs have been assembled on "Demolition," an album due from
Lost Highway Records on Sept. 24. The styles range from country-folk
to snarling alt-rock, with guest appearances by Gillian Welch, David
Rawlings and Chris Stills. Adams is about to begin recording the
official follow-up to "Gold." ...</TE>
<TE>   With the Distillers starting to get airplay on KROQ-FM (106.7),
and MTV and the band's deal with Epitaph Records up, major labels are
starting to show an interest in the trio. Warner Bros., Atlantic,
Maverick, DreamWorks and Universal Records are all said to be
interested, with representatives of several labels spotted at the
band's two sold-out Roxy shows last weekend.</TE>

<LD>Here's the status of some of the kid literature projects wending
their way to the big screen, in order of probable release:</LD>
<LD>   "Tuck Everlasting"</LD>
<LD>   Every day of filming "Tuck Everlasting," which is due in October,
a crowd of teenagers would assemble near the Maryland movie set
bearing dog-eared copies of Natalie Babbitt's popular young adult
novel.</LD>
<TE>   "They'd have me or the actors sign the book," recalls director Jay
Russell ("My Dog Skip"). "It carries a huge responsibility to try to
deliver for these kids a version of the story that they will feel
does the book justice. It has a unique place in children's
literature. It is dealing with the very heavy theme about death, and
death's place in the life process."</TE>
<TE>   Yet neither the book nor the film is heavy. Set primarily at the
turn of the century, it tells the story of what happens when a
sheltered teenager meets a strange, free-spirited family that can
never get old. The film boasts more Oscar winners than almost any
other film this year, from Ben Kingsley to William Hurt and Sissy
Spacek, both of whom approached the project because they'd read the
book with their kids.</TE>
<TE>   Although Babbitt's book is one of the top-grossing children's
books of all time, "she has fought off movie adaptations for years,"
Russell says. "It's impossible to literally adapt a book to the
screen. Reading a book is a much more active process, because readers
are creating their own movies in their own minds with their own point
of view on the characters. There's no way I'm going to compete with a
reader's imagination. I told her this movie would not be your book,
but based on your book. That eased her concerns quite a bit."</TE>
<TE>   The main difference is that the filmmakers changed the girl
(played by "Gilmore Girls' " Alexis Bledel) from age 10 to 15,
because she falls in love with the family's 17-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Already, an early copy of the film has played like gangbusters at
a national librarian's conference. "We're a hit with the librarians,"
Russell adds with a laugh. "We had to make sure we were OK with the
literary crowd."</TE>
<TE>   "Pinocchio"</TE>
<TE>   As a child, Italian comic-turned-director Roberto Benigni was
nicknamed "Pinocchietto" and for the last 20 years, he has dreamed of
making a movie version of Carlo Collodi's classic about a young
puppet who yearns to be a boy. "Every time I finished a movie, I
would try to make 'Pinocchio,' but I never found the courage. I
wasn't brave," Benigni says from Italy. "I tried to do it with
Federico Fellini, and we did a lot of drawings and tests with me as
Pinocchio in makeup, and we shot a little film. But then Fellini said
to me, 'Robertino, you have to do 'Pinocchio,' not me.' "</TE>
<TE>   The film, scheduled for Christmas, was shot on elaborate Italian
sound stages, which include three entirely constructed villages. The
Blue Fairy, who arrives on a carriage pulled by 200 white mice, is
played by Benigni's wife, Nicoletta Braschi, while the actor has the
part of the young puppet.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fairy tale. The character of Pinocchio is an illusion.
It's a question of spirit. I hope when you see the movie, after the
first 10 seconds you see me, I am just Pinocchio. You don't think
about my age. The spirit is the spirit of the boy," says Benigni, who
adjusted all the players to his grown-up-sized Pinocchio. "The other
boys who come to school with me--everybody is my age. The land of
toys is full of men, gambling and having fun. I didn't like it to be
me big surrounded by little guys."</TE>
<TE>   There are already more than 20 film renditions of "Pinocchio."
Benigni loves the 1940 Disney version but notes, "Disney couldn't
make the entire story, because they needed to put in the songs. We're
trying to really make for the first time the original full story of
'Pinocchio.' "</TE>
<TE>   Don't look for a singing, dancing Jiminy Cricket. The film opens
with the intrepid insect sternly warning the young, impetuous puppet,
"You have to do the right thing. You have to do what you're told,"
Benigni says. "After 10 minutes, Pinocchio goes 'OK, shut up!' and
kills the cricket. It's a wonderful scene, very funny, and as in the
original story, Jiminy Cricket comes alive again in the shape of a
ghost, and he follows Pinocchio for the entire story." Benigni
giggles. "He's the conscience and you cannot kill your conscience."</TE>
<TE>   "The Cat in the Hat"</TE>
<TE>   After languishing in development for years, "The Cat in the Hat,"
childhood's most famous ode to anarchy, begins filming in September
for a Thanksgiving 2003 release. Mike Myers stars as the Cat. Randy
Newman is writing songs, and prominent production designer Bo Welch
is making his directorial debut.</TE>
<TE>   The film takes place not in a fantasy world like Whoville, but in
a kind of heightened reality, akin to the Technicolor suburbia Welch
designed for such Tim Burton films as "Edward Scissorhands."</TE>
<TE>   Universal's co-president of production, Mary Parent, says that
"it's just like in the book. It has the famous moment when the
children are looking out the window, the cat comes to pay the
children a visit and brings along Thing One and Thing Two. The fish
can come alive the way he does on the pages of the book with what we
have available technically."</TE>
<TE>   It's faithful to the book but endows the tale of the mischievous
cat with a moral. "They're kids that are bored," producer Brian
Grazer of Imagine Entertainment explains. "They've enjoyed too many
of the luxuries of modern society. The cat emerges and comes to life
and becomes a catalyst for creating fun and naughtiness, but teaching
them a lesson that even without modern technology, every kid, rich or
poor, has access to all these things."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Seuss's widow, Audrey Geisel, is being consulted extensively,
as she was on the film version of "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole
Christmas." "I show her every draft of the script and consult with
her on casting. She's a tough customer. It takes a lot of creative
energy to satisfy her," Grazer says, adding that one thing that's
important to her is that "she doesn't want vulgarity. She refers to
it as potty humor."</TE>
<TE>   The film is also a pleasant coda to a spate of ugly lawsuits
between Myers and Imagine and Universal over the implosion of a
proposed "Dieter" movie, based on one of Myers' "Saturday Night Live"
characters. "The Cat in the Hat," it seems, can heal even the worst
Hollywood feuds.</TE>
<TE>   Says Grazer, "You get over it when people see the same creative
vision."</TE>
<TE>   "Lemony Snicket's Seriesof Unfortunate Events: The Movie"</TE>
<TE>   It's not too often that authors get to appear in the film, but
Lemony Snicket will be making his big-screen debut during the 2003
holiday season in the big-screen version of "A Series of Unfortunate
Events," which will encompass primarily the first and third Snicket
books: "The Bad Beginning" and "The Wide Window."</TE>
<TE>   Author Daniel Handler "wanted to have a role for Lemony Snicket in
the script," Paramount's John Goldwyn says. "It was not a condition
of the rights agreement, but it was one of the ways we were able to
close the rights agreement. Everybody wanted the material."</TE>
<TE>   "The character of Lemony Snicket, he functions in the book as a
sort of unreliable narrator that I think a lot of my readers have
taken pleasure in, so it seems natural to put him in," explains
Handler.</TE>
<TE>   Although Handler is known for the extravagance of his live
readings, he doesn't actually plan to play Snicket himself. "No, no,
no. Goodness, no. Who am I? Sly Stallone?" However, he does seem
tickled by the narcissism inherent in the predicament.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of strange to start to look at old movies to figure out
who should play your own alter ego. I think that's a game everybody
plays in Hollywood--who would play you in the movie. It's strange to
actually have some form of that conversation taking place."</TE>
<TE>   Handler is calling from New York, where the San Francisco resident
has flown to meet director Barry Sonnenfeld and producer Scott Rudin.
Their last projects together were the two "Addams Family" movies,
whose macabre, ghoulish tone is reminiscent of the neo-Victorian,
Edward Gorey-esque world of the Baudelaire orphans, "Lemony
Snicket's" heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike "Harry Potter's" J.K. Rowling, who has insisted on fealty
to her creations, "I don't feel like it has to be a carbon copy of
the book," Handler says. "I think all writers have some regret when a
book is published and they always think there is something I wish I
could have done differently. It's interesting to see if they work."</TE>
<TE>   "Peter Pan"</TE>
<TE>   When producer Lucy Fisher was a child, she insisted that her
parents call her Wendy. Producer and former Disney Studios Chairman
Joe Roth says that seeing Mary Martin in "Peter Pan" on Broadway was
the transformative artistic experience of his life. "I was 6 and
living in Manhattan and I'm convinced I'm in the movie business
because of that day," Roth says. "People fly and battle pirates. For
me personally, it was hard to beat as a kid."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher first tried to make "Peter Pan" 27 years ago, when she
bought the rights for Zoetrope, Francis Ford Coppola's company. Roth
had a stint with the material when he was at Disney Studios in the
mid-'90s, and asked "Home Alone" writer John Hughes to adapt the
material. "As best I know, he had updated it a little bit to a WWII
setting, but he never felt comfortable completing it."</TE>
<TE>   The new $100-million incarnation, due in the 2003 holidays, will
tap the resources of not only Roth's company (Revolution), but two
studios, Columbia and Universal. It stars British actor Jason Isaacs
as Hook and Mr. Darling, and Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher says the new version brings back elements of the story not
seen in Disney's famous animated version, such as mermaids and
"simultaneous climates--depending on whether Peter is around is how
spring-like it becomes."</TE>
<TE>   "Peter Pan" author J.M. Barrie talks about how a child's
imagination is Neverland, and the ideas run into other ideas. The
landscape of your dream life doesn't have direct borders."</TE>
<TE>   "Curious George"</TE>
<TE>   At the height of his glory at the newly merged Vivendi Universal,
former Chairman Jean-Marie Messier touted the spunky monkey as the
new conglomerate's Mickey Mouse, an adorable mascot that could be
synergized across every division and endow the corporation with just
the right touch of insouciance and cuddliness.</TE>
<TE>   The corporation is now in the midst of imploding, and as
Universal's Parent points out, "it's not like we have Curious George
Way and a statue of Curious George holding up the building."</TE>
<TE>   Yet that hasn't stopped the company's plans to turn the little
chimp into a big-screen franchise, although a film based on the
character is still in the early stages of development with an eye on
a 2005 release.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been really hard for me," says Grazer, who has been chipping
away at the problem for a decade. "I tried to do it live-action, then
mixed-media, then live action with digital effects, then I realized
it might look old-fashioned." He has commissioned numerous drafts, as
well as design experiments, before settling on the apparently
definitive computer-generated animation take. The latest version of
the script is being worked on by Michael McCullers of "Austin Powers"
fame.</TE>
<TE>   "The message of the piece I find very personal," Grazer adds.
"It's curiosity that excites me every day and keeps me alive."</TE>
<TE>   "Where the Wild Things Are"</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Sendak's book was one of the first picture books to
present a realistic, imperfect child, and to examine the world from
inside the angry tot's mind.</TE>
<TE>   Sendak spent a year writing the book and two years illustrating
it, and part of the challenge in making the movie has been expanding
the story's intuitive, fantastical quality into a movie.</TE>
<TE>   "My books are very strange," Sendak says. "I'm talking about
emotional issues and covering them with the sheerest story."</TE>
<TE>   In "Where the Wild Things Are," Max has a tantrum, finds a boat
that carries him to a far-off island, has a rumpus with the creatures
there and goes home--hardly enough narrative for a film (although
there has been an opera of the book).</TE>
<TE>   "To invent a story that doesn't drown the interior content is to
put your finger on where the problem lies," Sendak says. "Does he go
to the island, find a pretty girl, they begin to date and share
coconuts together? It could go on like that....They meet a Harry
Potter-like magician who lives deep in the forest."</TE>
<TE>   The author and/or illustrator of more than 40 books sighs with the
horror of it: "God, I hate wizards."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Hanks became involved after he read the book to his children,
Sendak says, adding happily, "He has emancipated views."</TE>
<TE>   The author sounds heartened by the recent progress made on the
new, computer-generated animation incarnation of the material, which
is still without a release date. Sendak is supervising the process
with his producing partner, John Carls, and the pair are not
Hollywood neophytes, having already launched three successful
animated TV series: "Little Bear," "Seven Little Monsters" (both
based on work by Sendak) and "George and Martha."</TE>
<TE>   One thing Sendak is sure to leave out is some of the simplistic
moralizing that has been the hallmark of a generation of treacly
children's fare. "Movies or books that set out to teach children are
sickening because the assumption is that they don't know this. The
book was for pleasure. People are annoyed that Max doesn't get
punished. My thought was, Why should he? He's doing exactly what
he'll do every week until he's 35 and goes to a therapist and his
parents throw him out."</TE>

<LD>** 1/2</LD>
<LD>   ALLISON MOORER</LD>
<LD>   "Miss Fortune"</LD>
<TE>   Universal South</TE>
<TE>   In her third solo album (due in stores Tuesday), this Alabama-bred
singer steps away from her neo-traditionalist country music stance
for a more pop-edged, radio-friendly approach, complete with lots of
string-assisted gloss.</TE>
<TE>   That's reasonable enough considering that Moorer, younger sister
of Shelby Lynne, simply wasn't getting anywhere commercially with her
old sound--even though her last album, 2000's "The Hardest Part," was
among the most acclaimed CDs to come out of Nashville in recent
years. More than the sound, the problem with "Miss Fortune" is the
material.</TE>
<TE>   It's tempting to think that anyone with as soulful a voice as
Moorer's can make almost any song work. This album shoots down that
theory. Several of the tunes, including "Tumbling Down" and "Cold in
California," are so conventional that even she is unable to breathe
life into them.</TE>
<TE>   Moorer, who co-wrote most of the material with husband Doyle
Primm, infuses a few songs, including the melancholy "Let Go" and the
stark, disillusioned "Dying Breed," with some of the raw emotion and
revelation that made the last album so striking. She also kicks up
her heels nicely on "Ruby Jewel Was Here."</TE>
<TE>   All too often, however, you get the feeling that Moorer and the
production team of Primm and R.S. Field devoted so much time to the
album's musical design that they lost track of the challenge of
actually saying something.</TE>
<TE>   -- Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   LINDA THOMPSON</TE>
<TE>   "Fashionably Late"</TE>
<TE>   Rounder</TE>
<TE>   One thing's for certain: The first album in 17 years from the
esteemed British folk singer-songwriter won't be picking up
nominations as party record of the year.</TE>
<TE>   But then, this is folk music in the time-honored troubadour
tradition, one where happy endings are the exception, not the rule.
Love withers, eludes or dies, sometimes mysteriously, sometimes
tragically, seemingly always for reasons beyond the control or
comprehension of the hapless humans at the center of these tales.</TE>
<TE>   Songs frequently sound as if they've been handed down through
centuries, a testament to Thompson's understanding of folk tradition
and to the compositional skills that allow her and collaborators to
turn out instantly timeless ballads and laments.</TE>
<TE>   Her primary partner in rhyme is son Teddy, inheriting the role his
father, Richard Thompson, once handled before his marriage to Linda
ended two decades ago. Two redeeming qualities somehow emerge from
these exquisitely crafted fables detailing life's harshness: the
power of music and love of family.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's own family helps here, with contributions not only from
her son, but also from daughter Kamila and even her ex, who drops in
to lend some of his signature guitar wizardry in "Dear Mary."</TE>
<TE>   --Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ** Filter, "The Amalgamut," Reprise. More tough melodies and
industrial-strength riffing from singer-guitarist Richard Patrick.
Songs with real hooks are no longer the exception, although a
shortage of musical personality has him often sounding like the Bryan
Adams of metal. Filter's third album is heavy with hard rock epics,
with "Where Do We Go From Here?" falling easily into the
radio-friendly territory of Foo Fighters or Alice in Chains. Lyrics
are typically vague, mostly muted anger and endless frustration, but
the precision of Patrick's delivery at least keeps it rolling.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Appleford</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2 Project Pat, "Layin' Da Smack Down," Hypnotize
Minds/Loud/Columbia. Sex, money and murder are the topics of choice
on the fourth album (in stores Tuesday) from this Three 6 Mafia
affiliate. The Memphis rapper's flow ranges from pimpish to menacing,
and his lyrics provide fresh wrinkles to these familiar topics. The
rambunctious beats from Three 6 Mafia members DJ Paul and Juicy J are
among the best and most sinister the genre has to offer.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2 Sasha, "Airdrawndagger," Kinetic. The debut album (in
stores Tuesday) of original material from the British DJ is an
ambitious, uncompromising work. There is nary a vocal on the 11
tracks. Instead, Sasha fills "Airdrawndagger" with rich, textured
grooves, dense keyboards and smart, progressive beats to create a
celebration of music akin to his DJ sets. In drawing on that spirit,
Sasha adds a dazzling chapter to his legacy.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   *** Deep Forest, "Music.Detected," Sony Music International. Deep
Forest's familiar fascination with samples has been set aside in this
10th-anniversary album. But fans of its global beat sounds need not
worry--co-leaders Eric Mouquet and Michel Sanchez are capable of
cooking up a steaming caldron of rhythms, melodies and textures in a
live studio setting. More unexpected are the blended vocals from
blues artist Beverly Jo Scott, Telepopmusik diva Angela McClusky, and
artists from Bulgaria, Japan and Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   --Don Heckman</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars
(excellent). The albums are already released unless otherwise noted.</TE>

<LD>   DEE DEE BRIDGEWATER</LD>
<LD>   "This Is New"</LD>
<TE>   Verve</TE>
<TE>   A musical free spirit if ever there was one, Bridgewater always
has defied categorization, and her anything-goes brand of vocalizing
reinvigorates the music of Kurt Weill. One would be hard-pressed to
name another female singer working today who can finesse the
theatrical elements of Weill's songs while also infusing them with
comparably brilliant scat singing, propulsive swing rhythm and
gorgeously lush tone colors. Like a great cabaret artist, Bridgewater
knows how to tell a story in classics such as "The Saga of Jenny" and
"Alabama Song," but she also can spin a soaring, practically operatic
vocal line in "Lost in the Stars." Where lesser singers approach
these masterworks with too much reverence, Bridgewater radically
reimagines them with sometimes purring, sometimes growling vocal
effects. Her sensational band and backup singers, led by the
hyper-virtuosic organist Thierry Eliez, add significantly to the
power of this recording, which stands as Bridgewater's best since her
1995 homage to Horace Silver. Like that indispensable disc, "This Is
New" (in stores Tuesday) casts familiar music in a glorious new
light.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   TROY ANDREWS</TE>
<TE>   "Trombone Shorty's</TE>
<TE>   Swingin' Gate"</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana Red Hot Records</TE>
<TE>   Andrews has been performing in his hometown, New Orleans, since he
was 5, which may explain why everyone there knows him simply--and
affectionately--as Trombone Shorty. At 17, he plays with remarkable
poise and musicianship--as he proves on his debut recording as
bandleader. Lest its title mislead listeners, this disc is no mere
rehash of Crescent City tailgate traditions. Andrews leads a nonet in
sophisticated arrangements steeped in unorthodox harmony and voicing.
The intricate Latin backbeats he incorporates into "Nora's Cooking,"
an original, and the traditional "St. James Infirmary" underscore an
impressive command of Afro-Caribbean rhythms. "Slippin' &amp; Trippin' "
emphasizes meticulous ensemble interplay over mere instrumental
virtuosity, while "Ooh Poo Pah Doo" explicitly acknowledges the New
Orleans parade rhythms that first drew Andrews to music. In each
case, it's the economy of his solos and the polish of Andrews'
ensemble that makes "Swingin' Gate" a particularly strong debut.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   ROSCOE MITCHELL &amp; THE NOTE FACTORY</TE>
<TE>   "Song for My Sister"</TE>
<TE>   Pi Recordings</TE>
<TE>   Adventurous listeners already revere Mitchell for jazz innovations
dating to the 1960s, but this release will inspire new appreciation
for his prowess as improviser and composer. Leading the Note
Factory--a groundbreaking nonet featuring two pianists, two bassists
and two percussionists--Mitchell presides over some of the most
lyrical, exquisitely transparent ensemble music of his career. From
the first notes of the title track, there's no question that Mitchell
and friends are exploring an unabashedly lyrical vein. Although cuts
such as "Sagitta" and "this" do not lack for rhythmic energy, it's
their softly shimmering textures and fantastic instrumental detail
that linger in memory. Throughout, one marvels at Mitchell's work on
soprano, alto and tenor saxophones, his penetrating tone still
ranking among the most distinctive in jazz.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   TRIO 3</TE>
<TE>   "Open Ideas"</TE>
<TE>   Palmetto Records</TE>
<TE>   This venturesome recording lives up to its name as it pushes the
art of the trio into unabashedly experimental terrain. Imagine
saxophonist Oliver Lake, bassist Reggie Workman and drummer Andrew
Cyrille improvising freely--with a bit of poetry recitation thrown in
for good measure--and you have a rough idea of what their
genre-bending ensemble is all about. Although not likely to appeal to
conservative tastes, Trio 3 offers several gripping, slow-to-medium
improvisations in which each player enters the fray when so inspired.
When they play an occasional stretch of mainstream swing, as on "Y2
Chaos," there's no doubt that Trio 3 easily could hold its own with
the best straight-ahead ensembles of its kind.</TE>

<KH>JOHN BALZAR</KH>
<HD>Sugar and Spice and a Parent's Worst Fears</HD>
<DH>To protect our kids, we are forced to rob them of
childhood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm struggling for the glad heart to raise a daughter in this
cockeyed, chilling summer of 2002. I can protect her, or so I tell
myself. The odds are with me. But I'm not so sure I can protect her
childhood. The odds of that grow longer all the time.</LD>
<LD>   We throw fences around our little girls, our boys too. We don't
let them venture beyond our gaze, and maybe not even that far. Their
movements, we plan. Their activities, we supervise. We give them a
code word so they won't be fooled and walk off with a Big Bad Wolf
who says Papa is hurt and needs help. We tell them not to worry about
lost puppies. We tell them about little girls stolen out of their
yards and grabbed out of their kitchens, and about big girls
kidnapped from lovers' lane. We scare them for their own good. And if
we don't, someone will.</LD>
<LD>   "The flowers, the crying, that's what they mention,'' says my
friend Susan about the first- and second-graders she teaches. "They
see it on TV; they hear people talk about it. But they won't say a
thing unless you bring it up. They hold it inside.''</LD>
<TE>   This burden, inside, weighs how heavy? How do we protect our
children from fear?</TE>
<TE>   I re-read Tom Sawyer this week. I'd forgotten that Mark Twain
intended it for parents too. "Part of my plan,'' he wrote in the
preface 126 years ago, "has been to pleasantly remind adults of what
they were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked,
and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.'' There were
Robin Hoods and pirates and puppy love and summer vacation. Yes, kids
and summer. There was a dangerous cave--and, I was reminded, the
witness to a murder.</TE>
<TE>   When I was a boy, I thought Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher were
quaint. Today I see that my childhood was closer to theirs than what
we give our daughters and sons today.</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time: My mom would ask, where have you been?
"Nowhere.'' Whatcha been doing? "Nothin'.'' Responsible parents can't
let children roam nowhere to do nothin' anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Parents used to feed kids that old line about having to walk a
mile to school in the snow. Now parents may be tempted to tell their
children about those days when they were allowed to walk even a block
on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Einstein was asked what he thought was the most important question
concerning the future of humanity. His reply: "Is the universe
friendly?''</TE>
<TE>   I turn to the steadiest voice I know, sociologist Barry Glassner:
"Kids are more likely to die falling off a bicycle without a helmet
on the way to the park than they are to be abducted when they get
there. They're more likely to be hit by lightning.'' He should know;
he wrote the book on it--"Culture of Fear.''</TE>
<TE>   The trouble: Glassner's odds of "less than one in a million" make
sense in our heads, but we aren't gamblers with something so close to
our hearts.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, it was shark attacks. This year, the world stops for
cable TV to feed off the kidnapping, assault, murders and rescues of
girls.</TE>
<TE>   We mobilize to safeguard our children from stray maniacs, but how
do we also protect the good-nights and sleep-tights of their
childhoods from the emotional bombardment of the tabloid echo
chamber?</TE>
<TE>   Last week's precautionary flier from the day-care center tells me
not to write my daughter's name on her clothes or toys. "A child is
less likely to fear someone who knows his/her name.'' It's not
enough, the warning explains, to tell children not to talk to
strangers. They might mistakenly think that "strangers'' are only
those people who are somehow strange-looking. "Teach them: Don't talk
to people you do not know.''</TE>
<TE>   Along with showing her how to swim and ride a bicycle, I'm told I
now must instruct her on how to kick a man in the groin. The novelist
Graham Greene once wrote: "There is always one moment in childhood
when the door opens and lets the future in.'' I wish I could put my
shoulder to the door and hold back the moment. But I don't dare.</TE>
<TE>   "Missing,'' "raped,'' "molested,'' "murdered.'' Children know more
the meaning of a circling helicopter than they do a robin's song.</TE>

<HD>Latinos Come Into Their Own in the Contest to Lead the LAPD</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Poor George Gascon can't get a break.</LD>
<LD>   An 18-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and the
head of the LAPD's training group, Gascon is a dark-horse candidate
to be the city's next chief of police. And he's managed to get some
impressive endorsements. Unfortunately, Gascon often winds up getting
confused with his better-known colleague, Deputy Chief David Gascon,
who has also applied for the chief's job.</LD>
<LD>   It happened again last week, when the Los Angeles Daily News
reported that George Gascon would be endorsed by the Oscar Joel
Bryant Foundation, the organization of African American LAPD
officers. The Daily News illustrated the story with a photo of David
Gascon.</LD>
<TE>   The Times committed a similar gaffe earlier this year, when George
Gascon was singled out for praise in a commentary. An editor
mistakenly assumed the writer had gotten the first name wrong for
David Gascon, who is well known because of his years as head of the
LAPD's media relations unit.</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully, George Gascon has a sense of humor and can laugh at
such incidents--one reason why he merits serious consideration for
the chief's job.</TE>
<TE>   Another unwritten qualification is a comfort level with L.A.'s
ethnic politics, which have shifted dramatically in the last two
decades. A city once so white and Protestant it could be lampooned as
Nebraska-by-the-sea is now 50% Latino. A police chief, like any other
politician, ignores this at his peril.</TE>
<TE>   That sounds like political correctness, but it is also pragmatic.
If a police force serves a population with many people who speak a
different language or share other cultural traits, then it behooves
that force to have plenty of officers who speak that language and
understand that culture. Luckily, young Latinos are pursuing LAPD
careers. Of 323 male and female recruits in training at the L.A.
Police Academy, 156 are Latino. More than one-third of the new cops
who will hit L.A.'s streets over the next few months are going to be
Latino. This in a department that is already one-third Latino.</TE>
<TE>   These young officers "are the future of the LAPD," in the words of
Art Placencia, the detective who heads the organization that
represents 600 of LAPD's Latino officers, La Ley. Rather than
endorsing a specific candidate for chief, La Ley is pushing for a
process that "will give fair and serious consideration" to any Latino
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, besides George Gascon and David Gascon, the only other
Latino candidate to publicly express an interest in the job is Oxnard
Police Chief Art Lopez, who served 28 years with the LAPD before
taking his current post in Ventura County. All told, 51 candidates
have applied, and the Police Commission aims to have three finalists
for Mayor James K. Hahn to consider by September.</TE>
<TE>   La Ley's stance is supported by other reputable Latino community
organizations and by influential civic leaders. All have taken a keen
interest in who gets the LAPD job because they believe that Latino
candidates were slighted the last two times a chief was picked.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, when the late Mayor Tom Bradley chose
Philadelphia's Willie L. Williams to head the LAPD, Latinos were
stunned that L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca, then a deputy chief in his
department, was not a finalist.</TE>
<TE>   That was in former Mayor Richard Riordan's mind five years later
when he ousted Williams in favor of Bernard C. Parks. Riordan clearly
wanted Parks to be chief. But to keep that from being too obvious,
the Riordan-appointed Police Commission put Sacramento Police Chief
Arturo Venegas Jr. on its list of finalists. In fact, Venegas had
little chance of getting the job. With so many Latinos watching--and
remembering the racially tinged mayoral campaign that Hahn waged last
year against Antonio Villaraigosa--Hahn is unlikely to try a similar
ploy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, while there are relatively few Latino candidates with the
experience and qualifications to run a police department as large and
complex as this city's, the few who are interested in the job
probably will get the fair consideration Latinos are demanding. Not
just because they deserve the respect but because they are important
role models for the many younger Latino officers who will someday
surely aspire to lead the LAPD.</TE>

<HD>The Boy Who Cried Rodent Carcinogen</HD>
<DH>The law requiring toxic warnings is beyond reason.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY I. MILLER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The principle that "the dose makes the poison"--in other words, that
almost any substance can be toxic at high levels--has been lost on
Californians.</LD>
<LD>   That is why, as required by a 16-year-old referendum proposition,
signs outside most commercial establishments proclaim that the state
of California has determined that patrons of these businesses may be
exposed to chemicals that can cause cancer or birth defects. Not that
in the overwhelming majority of cases there's any hint of risk
greater than, say, the household cleaners in your home, but the law
requires a warning about any product that contains even tiny amounts
of a chemical that, at high doses, can cause cancer in lab animals.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, this ridiculous law is being challenged. The American
Council on Science and Health, which promotes science as the basis
for public policy, has filed a suit to illustrate the absurdity of
California's Proposition 65, as it is commonly known. The
organization, taking advantage of a provision in Proposition 65 that
permits anyone to bring a "bounty hunter" suit in the "public
interest," has filed the statutory 60-day notice with the attorney
general and the defendant.</LD>
<TE>   Ah, yes, the defendant: scandalous Whole Foods Markets, which, as
alleged in the suit, has failed to warn the public about the presence
of acrylamide, a chemical found on California's list of chemicals
known to cause cancer and reproductive toxic effects. Acrylamide is
present in minuscule amounts in the organic whole-wheat bread that is
baked and sold by the defendant.</TE>
<TE>   Truth to tell, the public interest here being pursued by the
council is not the protection of consumers from a cancer-causing
agent or from the predations of Whole Foods.</TE>
<TE>   We know, as observed by eminent UC Berkeley toxicologists Bruce
Ames and Lois Gold, "no human diet can be free of naturally occurring
chemicals that are rodent carcinogens." The company's organic
whole-wheat bread is no more a health threat than is the
infinitesimal amount of radioactive potassium that is a ubiquitous
constituent of glass bottles and window panes.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, the council reckons that the public interest is best
served by the principle that laws should be based on sound science
and not unfounded, ideologically driven fears.</TE>
<TE>   The Whole Foods Market chain is the model defendant because it
prides itself on providing the ultimate in tasty, healthful foods
that contain no synthetic chemicals. And also, I dare to hope,
because it is so nauseatingly sanctimonious--and wrong--about
avoiding the fruits of new technology such as foods from genetically
improved plants.</TE>
<TE>   So, although it "protects" customers from so-called Frankenfoods,
Whole Foods sells organic breads made from organic, nonbrominated,
unbleached flour that inevitably contain acrylamide, a naturally
occurring rodent carcinogen.</TE>
<TE>   What most people don't realize, however, is that any kind of bread
contains naturally occurring rodent carcinogens, such as furfural.
And so do most other foods, organic or not. Some, like edible
mushrooms, Roquefort cheese and barbecued red meat, have relatively
high levels of such compounds.</TE>
<TE>   Yet because the tests that measure whether a chemical is a rodent
carcinogen typically employ very high doses administered over the
animals' lifetime (and also because many animals have unique
susceptibilities), the results should not be directly extrapolated to
humans.</TE>
<TE>   Why bread in the test case? Why not French fries, for example,
which have higher levels of acrylamide than bread? For one thing,
risk is proportional both to the intrinsic toxicity of a harmful
substance and the level of people's exposure, and even though the
level in French fries is higher than that in bread, more people are
exposed to bread (that is, more consume bread) than to French fries.
Thus the higher probable exposure from bread would make it more of a
risk--if it were a risk at all.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 65 simply ignores the reality that we live in a sea of
chemicals whose dose and potential hazard fluctuate widely. The
ubiquity of the "warning" signs about dangerous chemicals is the
legal equivalent of "the boy who cried wolf."</TE>

<HD>The Decline and Fall of Seattle</HD>
<DH>The Emerald City Is in Distress, With Dot-coms and Boeing
Leading the Way. At Least You Can Still Get Great Coffee--to Sip
While Sitting in Traffic Jams or Reading the Help Wanted Ads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was perhaps a measure of how far Seattle has fallen--from its
place deep in America's restless heart, a city of snowy mountains and
inland seas to which the disillusioned, ambitious, bored and broke
from the rest of the country flocked in the 1990s--to where it is
now, which is a city under siege. Or maybe Seattle, with its average
3 feet a year of precipitation, has always expected the sky to
deliver bad things. But when a bag full of cremated human remains
dropped onto Safeco Field one recent day, hardly anybody thought
twice.</LD>
<TE>   There it was, right before 45,000 people were scheduled to show up
for the Mariners series against the Orioles, and--plop!--the bag hit
with a thud, spewing the white powder of a baseball fan who had
always wanted to spend eternity in the outfield. A hazardous
materials team speedily swept up the remains before the crowd showed
up. The aircraft charter company apologized for the bungled drop. But
for the public at large, no apology seemed to be expected. OK, a dead
man hits Safeco Field, seemed to be the thinking of most Seattleites.
What next? (Some, of course, thought a mere body bag dropping out of
the sky was too simple an explanation, considering the succession of
plagues that have hit this city over the last year or two. These
voices pointed toward something more sinister. Bill Hoff of South
Seattle, in an e-mail alert, said it was more believable to presume
the city was being secretly poisoned: ''I would not advise anyone to
move to Seattle. We are being slowly killed . . . .'')</TE>
<TE>   All this in a place that is home to three of the world's 10
richest men, a lively arts scene, an inviting coffeehouse on every
corner, and two spectacular snow-capped mountain ranges as cheap
scenic backdrops. Just six years ago, Newsweek put then-Slate
magazine editor Michael Kinsley on its cover, dressed in a raincoat
for his move to the Pacific Northwest. ''Swimming to Seattle:
Everybody Else Is Moving There,'' the cover said. ''Should you?''</TE>
<TE>   Seattle had clean air, raucous little music clubs that nurtured
bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam, good schools (the
superintendent, John Stanford, was a former Army general who said
things like, ''Every child will read,'' and then gave the ax to
principals whose students didn't), and a dot-com boom that was
sprouting millionaires out of the Microsoft mothership like cotton
off a dandelion. It had Starbucks, Eddie Bauer, Nordstrom and
Immunex, not to mention Boeing. It had a new symphony hall and a
central library, city hall and opera house under construction, two
new major league sports stadiums, new museums and theaters--$800
million in new civic building during the latter half of the magic
'90s.</TE>
<TE>   So when did it all start going wrong? Kurt Cobain, the legendary
lead singer of Nirvana, died in 1994, leaving 7,000 stunned mourners
gathered at Seattle Center. Not long after that, grunge, the most
phenomenal alternative music scene since the British invasion of the
1960s, was pronounced dead in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, a city that had always seen itself as a petri
dish of protest movements saw its police department pick up black
helmets and tear gas rifles and shut down most of downtown during the
World Trade Organization riots. Then the millennium celebration at
the Space Needle had to be called off while the rest of the world was
partying because an Algerian national was caught at the ferry
terminal with enough explosives to blow the structure into the
stratosphere. The city revved up for a big Mardi Gras party in 2001,
but that turned into a riot too (while then-Mayor Paul Schell, it was
frequently noted in the papers, was home sleeping).</TE>
<TE>   The next day, there was a magnitude 6.8 earthquake. A federal
judge ruled that Microsoft had grown too powerful and threatened its
sole dominion over Windows, the most successful computer-operating
system ever conceived. The dot-coms dot-bombed, and Seattle furniture
stores, which once couldn't keep Aeron desk chairs in stock at $699
apiece, by last year were giving away office furniture in the parking
lots.</TE>
<TE>   A woman tried to throw herself off the Ship Canal bridge, while
commuters in a town once named America's politest by etiquette expert
Marjabelle Young Stewart cheered her on. ''Jump, bitch, jump!''
yelled one bystander. John Stanford got cancer and died.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing, a company that has been virtually synonymous with Seattle
since the first commercial plane took flight in 1919, pulled up
stakes and moved its headquarters to Chicago last September. ''John,
why didn't you call?'' a stunned Paul Schell asked John Warner, a
Boeing senior vice president. The answer was obvious. Not plagues,
really. Just that it was over. Boeing had a whole world out there,
and Seattle was in its rearview mirror. Whatever the magical
ingredients were that made the sun shine on Seattle for so long, it
had started raining again.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as the rest of the country sees what looks like the tail end
of the recession, Seattle and the Pacific Northwest are stuck in the
worst economic downturn in 20 years, with the highest unemployment in
the country. There are dark predictions that Boeing, which has shed
18,700 workers in the Puget Sound region, could be looking at even
more layoffs. State government this year closed a $1.6-billion budget
shortfall with smoke and mirrors and is looking at another big gap
next year.</TE>
<TE>   The city is awash in unemployed machinists, engineers and the
human driftwood of the dot-com implosion--those who weren't around
long enough to make a killing before the market crashed. Some seem
dazed, not old enough to have seen a recession before, not sure where
all the money went. Many can be found pulling espressos these days,
or hitting the trails around Mt. Rainier with their also-unemployed
friends. ''There are only so many 'Seinfeld' episodes you can watch
and DVDs you can rent,'' a former AOL Time Warner employee explains.</TE>
<TE>   The post-dot-com scene in Seattle was richly captured not long ago
in a poem, ''WebVanish,'' that showed up on Postget.com, a Web site
for techies looking to network. The author, JeffRD, was chronicling
the demise of Webvan. The Internet grocer had bought out the Seattle
area's HomeGrocer.com, burned through hundreds of millions of dollars
and then, last July, filed for bankruptcy and sold off its assets.
The Redmond, Wash., auction at Webvan's distribution center--32
office chairs, 100 Compaq computers, 246 hand-held scanners--was
similar to other sell-offs across the city during the past two years.
The poem got a flood of responses, including from people who were
reminded of T.S. Eliot and his ''Waste Land'' after the Great War.</TE>
<TE>   A first auction lot comes into view.</TE>
<TE>   The closed circuit security system--lifeless CRT windows unplugged
from their lifeless world . . .</TE>
<TE>   Fleets of round and oval tables jostle like bumper cars at an
abandoned carnival . . .</TE>
<TE>   Row after row of chairs without wheels . . . nowhere to be found
in this collection. A closer look. Each chair bears a lot number.
They'll auction the chairs out from under you if you aren't careful.</TE>
<TE>   Back downstairs.</TE>
<TE>   A can of Webvan pens--I'll take one as a souvenir. I don't know
what a billion dollars looks like, but I've seen its carcass.</TE>
<TE>   My Seattle story started half a world away, in Jerusalem. I was at
a cocktail party talking to Doug Struck, then the Middle East
correspondent for the Baltimore Sun, whose wife, Kathleen, was headed
for Puget Sound to buy property on an island near Seattle. It had
always been a dream of theirs to live on an island in Puget Sound.</TE>
<TE>   Wait a minute, I said, clutching my wine glass in a panic. That's
not your dream. That's my dream. You are absolutely not going to live
on an island in Puget Sound before I am. I bolted from the Middle
East, and five months later was installed in an old farmhouse on
Bainbridge Island--half an hour's commute from Seattle by ferry--and
in the Los Angeles Times' Seattle office, 10 floors above Elliott
Bay.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1995, and Seattle was riding high. Huge chunks of rural
Bainbridge--the place that helped inspire David Guterson's ''Snow
Falling on Cedars''--were being cleared for new cul-de-sacs and rows
of $460,000 houses with home offices and mini-gyms, snatched up by
young Microsoft families who often paid cash.</TE>
<TE>   My husband and I were working to pay off our mortgage (he got
hired at Boeing as an engineer). Everyone else, it seemed, was either
stuck in 18-hour-a-day work mode or apologizing for having banked
their million and expressing sympathy that I couldn't make it to play
group with my kids.</TE>
<TE>   Next door, a half-million-dollar cottage with an expansive view of
Port Madison was sold to Aileen Agricola, a 35-year-old high-tech
refugee who had put away a comfortable stock portfolio working for a
Bay Area software company. She was through with working for the
moment. She would study for her master gardener's credential and tend
the flowers outside the door. She would buy a cafe and sell espresso
and ice cream, start a film discussion group on its comfortable
sofas. She would dabble at designing Web pages, if she had the
inclination, but she wouldn't need to.</TE>
<TE>   ''It was just a romantic dream--coming to Seattle, finding a cafe,
finding a beautiful house and beautiful surroundings and still having
a foot in the software industry,'' she says.</TE>
<TE>   Then came April 14, 2000, when the Nasdaq fell 355 points, its
worst one-day point loss in history. Microsoft chairman William Gates
III lost $10 billion that week. Agricola saw her Seattle dream start
taking on water. The cafe was leaking money--not enough people had
time or money to sit around drinking coffee anymore. The dream house
still had a mortgage, and it appeared that Agricola was going to have
to get on the ferry, put her resume under her arm and--horror of
horrors--find a job.</TE>
<TE>   Along, as it turned out, with about 25,000 other newly unemployed
techies. Agricola, a woman who had engineered huge software deals all
over the world, was competing with 20-somethings who barely knew how
to write html coding, and they were both at the back of a long line.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't as if I couldn't sympathize. Boeing had ramped down, and
my husband was collecting unemployment and working on the yard all
day. I would call Agricola on Saturday nights to ask her to come
watch a movie. ''I can't, I'm busy,'' she'd say. What are you doing,
I'd ask. ''Laying on the couch.''</TE>
<TE>   There was a great deal of shared misery. Amazon.com was shipping
out workers faster than books. Companies such as AT&amp;T Broadband,
Nextel, Egghead.com and Kozmo.com were rushing to downsize, and a
city that only a few months before had been awash in cash and stock
options was left staring like deer in headlights at stock prices on
the computer screens.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the losses were on paper. Devin Hermanson, 36, had been
in on the beginning of Freeshop, an online direct-marketing business
that matched free samples, catalogs and magazines with potential
customers. The Web site grew to become the 10th most trafficked
online commerce site, but later fell on hard times. Hermanson broke
out on his own two years ago, taking hundreds</TE>
<TE>   of thousands of dollars worth of stock in Freeshop and starting a
new company, goNextdoor.com, with a friend. It was a great idea,
putting customers in touch with businesses and services in their own
neighborhoods. But the company incorporated on April 14, 2000--the
day of the Nasdaq crash. Coincidence? Bad luck? Plague?</TE>
<TE>   Hermanson and his partner had a meeting scheduled that night with
a man they believed would invest in their company. As it turned out,
much of what the man might have invested had evaporated several hours
earlier. ''When we got there, his wife was there and he wasn't, and
his wife warned us that he was in a really bad mood,'' Hermanson
recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Hermanson was in worse shape. He had exercised his Freeshop stock
options the day before the crash, meaning he had to pay taxes on
stock valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars when the market
price a day later was next to nothing. Bottom line: he owed $80,000
in cash on $3,000 worth of stock.</TE>
<TE>   Hermanson kept goNextdoor.com running on his credit cards, but
eventually they ran out too (he had a credit card declined while on a
date). He threw in the towel and later landed a spot as a customer
relations manager with Netstock, an online brokerage. That lasted
until May, when he got laid off.</TE>
<TE>   ''I have friends who have been unemployed for two years. I've seen
people leave town. I've seen people become depressed. I think there's
a lot of Prozac out there right now,'' Hermanson says. ''But I've
also seen some really wonderful things happening, in terms of just
people supporting each other.</TE>
<TE>   ''During the boom years, this strange correlation was drawn
between net worth and brilliance. There was a really strange
ego-inflation thing happening. And the deflation happened, and I've
seen a lot of humility. People have been rediscovering some parts of
themselves that kind of got lost a bit when people thought they were
going to be competing against each other in next year's yacht races.
People have become a little bit more down to earth.''</TE>
<TE>   David Brewster, former publisher of Seattle Weekly who now heads
the Town Hall concert and lecture program, says everyone has had a
reality check. ''We were Brigadoon, and now we're being taken down a
few pegs. One of the problems is the city remains very ambivalent
about its own bigness. A place like Portland is not ambivalent. It
comes down on the small-is-better side of things. Well, thinking big
was the big idea in Seattle. All through the '90s we thought big.
World-beating companies, major league culture, restaurants, sports.
If I were to define Seattle at all when it was in that Brigadoon
period, it was the dream of living in a livable city, a humanly
scaled city, and yet having a globally significant job.</TE>
<TE>   ''Before, it was always, if you want to be big time, you have to
live in god-awful New York. If you want to live in a quality-of-life
place and have a good place to raise your kids, you move to a small
town. Seattle was, guess what, folks, you can have it all. [I could]
be Rob Glaser [CEO of RealNetworks], jumping on planes to world
capitals, and when I get back we'll go to the Seattle Film Festival.
We'll go biking together.''</TE>
<TE>   Despite the boom, Seattle always seemed of two minds on the new
economy. With its blue-collar Boeing roots, its long line of stern
Scandinavian loggers and fishermen, its suspicion of ostentation, the
city spent the '90s getting used to the new big thinkers--people like
Glaser, Howard Schultz at Starbucks and Jeff Bezos at
Amazon.com--embracing them, really, while wondering if it should be
holding its nose. Seattleites looked a little aghast at the weird,
rainbow-colored rock 'n' roll museum built by billionaire Microsoft
co-founder Paul Allen at Seattle Center and designed by architect
Frank Gehry in a shape reminiscent of a smashed guitar. (Local
columnist Ron C. Judd likened it to ''The Wreck of the Partridge
Family Bus.'')</TE>
<TE>   New Seattle money gravitates toward the eastern suburbs. It lives
in neighborhoods like Medina, on Lake Washington's Gold Coast, where
Bill Gates erected his 65,000-square-foot residential compound and
former Microsoft president Jon Shirley recently built his
two-bedroom, 23,000-square-foot home and personal art gallery. New
Seattle is what had yachts on back order and made the Steinway
distributorship the biggest in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Old Seattle lives in the stately rough-timber houses on Capitol
Hill or First Hill. Old Seattle is embarrassed by ostentation, wears
Eddie Bauer fleece when shopping, wouldn't be caught dead in a
Porsche.</TE>
<TE>   Priscilla Bullitt Collins, 71, is Old Seattle, part of the city's
powerful Bullitt broadcasting family and chairwoman of the
$103-million Bullitt Foundation--a scion of Seattle aristocracy. She
gave the famous old Stimson-Green Mansion for public use and lives in
a tiny condominium in a graceful old building nearby. It has no
dining room (''A dining room is just a place to collect papers,'' she
says) and the coffee table is cluttered with books.</TE>
<TE>   Collins' fortune dates back to her grandfather, C.D. Stimson, who
built a shingle mill in Seattle during the Klondike Gold Rush, got
rich, and then parlayed that into an even bigger fortune in downtown
Seattle real estate. Her mother, Dorothy Stimson Bullitt--a single
mother of three after her husband's death--made a new fortune
building a Seattle broadcasting empire.</TE>
<TE>   ''There are a lot of billionaires in this town these days,''
Collins says. ''I don't know many of them, but I know their mothers.
I know Mrs. McCaw, I know Mrs. Gates, I know Mrs. Allen. A lot of
these 26-year-olds that have millions and millions of dollars,
they're afraid--afraid of losing it. I tell these people, you lose,
you go out and do it again. You're 28. And I was told that wasn't the
point. I asked some people, why are these young people so scared?
They told me, well, they're scared of losing it because they think
they can't make it over again. They're afraid that it will be exposed
that it was all just dumb luck.''</TE>
<TE>   For those who remember Seattle before everybody got rich, it was
about time to put on the the brakes anyway. The prosperity of the
'90s saw housing prices go up by a third and the freeways slow to a
crawl-- earning Seattle the distinction of having the second-worst
traffic in the country. A city once known for ''the bluest skies
you've ever seen'' was ranked this spring in the bottom 5% of the
country for toxic air pollution. Orcas have begun dying in Puget
Sound.</TE>
<TE>   In March, a young advertising copywriter who goes by the screen
name Steele launched a Web site, Seattles--ks.com, as a meeting
ground for people who think the city falls short of its hype. ''We
had a huge boom in the '90s,'' he says. ''We really had a tremendous
opportunity with all kinds of tax money coming in. What did we do
with it? We had meetings and committees.'' (Steele uses only his
screen name on the site because he still holds out hope of getting
work in this town.)</TE>
<TE>   By last month, the site had more than 2,000 postings. Traffic, not
surprisingly, often tops the list. The average Seattle commuter
spends 30 minutes getting to work. Voters approved $3.9 billion in
1996 to build a light rail system, but after years of dithering over
the route, not a single track has been laid and the price has gone up
by $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The state has done little to build new highways to accommodate the
484,700 new people who moved into Puget Sound in the 1990s, in part
because it would cost upward of $50 billion to do it right. The idea
of Washington farmers and longtime Seattleites paying more to make
room for newcomers helped ignite the beginnings of a taxpayer revolt.
In 1999, voters ap-proved an initiative--I-695--that slashed the
traditional source of highway construction funding, the motor vehicle
excise tax. The second shoe dropped last November, with the passage
of a ballot measure that limits property tax growth to 1% a year,
unless authorized by voters. The two measures, with the third whammy
of the recession, have left the state in a funding gridlock the likes
of which it has never seen.</TE>
<TE>   Three times last year, Democratic Gov. Gary Locke called the
Legislature into special session to try to come up with a
transportation funding package. Three times the Legislature failed to
act. The best they could do was schedule a vote for November asking
citizens to approve $7.7 billion in new revenues, including a hefty
hike in the gas tax, for transportation projects. It is a pittance
compared to the money needed for roads, almost everyone agrees it
won't eliminate congestion, and hardly anybody thinks it will pass.</TE>
<TE>   People wonder why the politicians didn't solve the transportation
problem while the state was flush with cash. Steele and others
believe the inertia is why Paul Schell got booted from office last
year, the first incumbent mayor defeated in 45 years. It wasn't the
WTO, necessarily; it wasn't that Boeing left town on Schell's watch;
it wasn't the economy. It was that the city could have done
something, it had all the makings, it coulda been a contender! And it
spent the '90s talking and dreaming.</TE>
<TE>   It was all summed up last summer when the soft-spoken,
philosophical former mayor was confronted at a community festival by
African American activist Omari Tahir-Garrett, who was protesting the
police department's treatment of blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said Tahir-Garrett bonked Schell in the face with a
megaphone. (Tahir-Garrett denies it, and his first trial ended with a
hung jury.) The 64-year-old mayor had a broken nose and a crushed eye
socket, and wore a black eye that served as a constant reminder of
the encounter. ''I always thought if he would have ducked when that
guy punched him and [he'd] punched him back, he would have been
reelected,'' Steele says. ''Instead, he took the shot and went
down.''</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it wasn't just the mayor and the Microserfs who got
knocked out by the recession. Regular Old Seattle got sucker-punched
too. Boeing's departure and the downsizing after Sept. 11 left 16,800
people out of work by midyear. These were workers with no stock
options, Steinway pianos or Belltown condos to sell. Many had worked
in the cavernous 747 assembly plant for much of their adult lives.
Now they don't know what to do.</TE>
<TE>   During previous Boeing busts, they could lie low and collect
unemployment, or find another temporary job until Boeing ramped up
again. But the latest Boeing moves don't seem part of the usual
boom-and-bust cycle that has been an integral feature of the Seattle
economy.</TE>
<TE>   When Boeing decamped for Chicago, leaving only its commercial
airplane division behind, it would have been great if the only
reasons were bad traffic and high taxes in Seattle, something the
city theoretically could fix. The reality was much worse: Boeing was
feeling its way into the new global economy, an arena in which there
are no hometowns, no loyalties, a world in which aircraft tails can
be built in Korea and wings in China, and all of them assembled in a
place like Seattle. Suddenly, it's no longer a given that Boeing's
new sonic cruiser--which everyone for years had assumed would be the
next bonanza--will be built in Seattle at all.</TE>
<TE>   The company has been upbeat, pledging its commitment to the Boeing
747, which is under increasing threat from newer, bigger Airbus
planes. Boeing Vice President Bob Watt, a fixture on the Seattle
scene who headed the Chamber of Commerce before joining the company
last year, says Seattle is not as dependent on Boeing as it once was.
The economy has diversified mightily. Biotech is thriving, as is
software, leaving aside the dot- coms. Microsoft hired about 5,000
new workers during the past year.</TE>
<TE>   ''People are cynical,'' Watt says. ''They're not as sure as they
once were that we're going to be able to do something. But the
reality is, we are in a much better position to do something about it
than we ever have been before. Part of our DNA is we know that we can
pull through those hard periods and we can pull through stronger and
better and different.''</TE>
<TE>   That's the way the city leadership sees it. ''We've got a long way
to go, but we need to do it and we will,'' says Mayor Greg Nickels.
''This slowdown in the economy might be the perfect time to begin
that work, create some jobs in building light rail and other
infrastructure pieces. The second thing is, even though we've had
that dot-</TE>
<TE>   com crash, obviously technology and the knowledge industry is
going to be with us for the long term. We need to position Seattle to
be able to compete for its share and more of that sector as it
rebounds.''</TE>
<TE>   Schell believes Seattle, with its strong ties to Pacific Rim
nations, its busy seaport, its wealth of intellectual capital, is
poised to join the kind of second tier of global cities--Berlin,
Sidney, Milan and Barcelona are others, he says--that will become the
important ''next step'' leaders of the global economy. ''You don't
have to be an L.A. or a Mexico City or a Rio anymore,'' says Schell.
''Paris and Rome are losing out to Lyon and Barcelona, where the
economy and the ideas are happening.''</TE>
<TE>   Schell gets impatient when people accuse the city of failing to
seize the moment of the '90s. ''I think I counted up almost $800
million in civic investments. One hell of a lot of stuff got done.
And the local papers were worried about, well, the mayor didn't
attend the riot at 1 in the morning at Mardi Gras. I was supposed to
be directing traffic, I guess. And, gee, we were embarrassed at the
WTO because the police had to use tear gas. I mean, give me a
break!''</TE>
<TE>   But even Schell believes that by the end of the decade, the town
needed a timeout. ''What was happening in the '90s, it was not
sustainable psychologically. There were too many people getting too
rich, too fast, and honestly believing they earned it. Our . . .
daughter had a friend who started working as a secretary at Amazon,
and she ended up being worth $4 or $5 million. And she was explaining
to her dad, well, I worked really hard, Dad, for that $5 million.''
Schell, who made his millions developing downtown real estate, shakes
his head--it's that Old Seattle, New Seattle thing again.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's much better to be based on reality, and a growth that's
long-term and sustainable,'' he says. ''Boeing will probably never go
back to 125,000 employees. The future growth will come from the
Microsofts, tourism, trade. We can maintain a smart city, so that
Boeing thinks it's important to keep its research and development
here, the intellectual capital will reside here, and we do that by
creating a place where smart people want to live.''</TE>
<TE>   There are those who will say that the entrepreneurial boom in the
'90s left a trail of corpses, and they will be right, but it is
perhaps in the fecund nature of the rain and the trees here that the
Seattle phenomenon was not mere transition but transformation. It was
Starbucks' vision of an Italian-style coffeehouse where people could
meet and sip espresso that changed the face of many street corners in
urban America. RealNetworks' delivery of instant multimedia to
computer screens changed the nature of radio and television. Craig
McCaw created the cellular phone industry here from scratch, Aldus
invented desktop publishing, Costco brought wholesaling to the
consumer, Nordstrom brought practical shoes and solicitous service
back to the department store.</TE>
<TE>   The very nature of philanthropy was transformed here, as dozens of
the software millionaires left their old jobs and took on new ones,
setting up fair-trade coffee enterprises to finance religious
ministries in Central America, digitally recording classic art and
the disappearing ethnic music of the world, gathering money from
their friends to buy and preserve tens of thousands of acres of
threatened wilderness. Paul Brainerd and his wife, Debbi, used their
money from Aldus to build a $50-million environmental learning center
on 255 acres of Bainbridge Island, where schoolchildren can explore
intact ecosystems in the middle of an urban environment, aided by an
array of technology.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Bill Gates launched the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation,
the largest philanthropic foundation in history with assets of more
than $24 billion. They aim at nothing less than bridging the gap in
human health between rich countries and poor ones, in addition to
providing massive infusions of cash into public schools and
libraries, minority scholarships and other endeavors.</TE>
<TE>   ''The dramatic growth in personal wealth has been pretty
extraordinary in terms of distinguishing us from most other cities,''
says Gates' father, William Gates Sr., who heads the foundation. He
admits he spent several years reminding his son that he had a
responsibility to give back some of the money he was making. ''The
statement that would come back was, the most important thing for this
town is for me to make that company succeed,'' Gates says. ''What do
you say to that? He was right. It was really just a matter of
priorities and time commitment. The evidence of the enormous
willingness of these people [to give back] is already quite
phenomenal.''</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Seattle got the comeuppance many people thought it deserved,
but the impression lingers that somebody is already figuring a way
out of it, somebody who got laid off and had a great idea while
kayaking yesterday morning.</TE>
<TE>   ''Seattle has no Civil War, it has no historic Hispanic culture,
it's just a lot of people from the great American heartland who moved
out here and did well, and it's a city that has no particular vision
of where it's going,'' says former Seattle Weekly publisher David
Brewster. ''It's just like Gatsby in that respect. It's in the
constant process of reinventing itself.</TE>
<TE>   ''It welcomes all these people with all these weird, unsettling
ideas--like, 'Why should people buy books in bookstores?' In Boston,
they would be told, 'Because they always have been. That's just the
way it is.' Or, 'Why should people sit in a classroom when they can
get the same information on a computer?' To understand the nature of
this city, it is that nothing is sacred.''</TE>
<TE>   Aileen Agricola, my neighbor, got out of her depression and
started volunteering last year at the Environmental Learning Center,
filing, answering phones, making coffee. Nobody seemed to know, or
much care, that only a few years ago she was closing
multimillion-dollar business deals. They all had pasts too. This was
now. In May, the center hired her to manage its database systems--a
job that would barely pay the mortgage and keep the cafe from sinking
into ruin.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's the job of my dreams,'' she says, and she isn't kidding.</TE>

<LD>California, Teddy Roosevelt once said, is west of the West, and most
years that description holds true, at least for the part of the state
west of the Sierra Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   To find the iconic American West, arid and empty, a coastal
Californian typically heads east, leaving the Pacific behind to reach
an ocean of sagebrush.</LD>
<LD>   But this parched summer, the distance between Southern California
and its Southwestern neighbors seems much shorter. Reminders abound
that this region we inhabit is desert and that we share scarce
sources of water.</LD>
<TE>   In New Mexico, Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez wants to tear out
public golf courses. Santa Fe is on Stage 3 water alert; Stage 4
shuts down development entirely and halts already restricted
lawn-watering and car-washing. City officials are talking about
trucking in water from Washington state.</TE>
<TE>   Tiny Aztec, N.M., is preparing to call for Stage 4 restrictions
should the Animus River--full of rocks and sand this year instead of
the usual summer rafters--run completely dry. In Los Ojos, where a
weaving cooperative provides much-needed jobs, the asters and other
wildflowers used to dye wool produce pallid traces of their usually
vivid blues and reds.</TE>
<TE>   Without rafters, without dye for weavers (or worse, without
buyers), the drought has financial import. The tourists who were
expected to stay closer to home in this year of terrorist attacks
stayed even closer than projected, or at least away from New Mexico,
Arizona and Colorado, where wildfires rained ash throughout June. Or
maybe it's the tumbling stock market that has made parking possible
in front of Santa Fe boutiques and galleries.</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully, midsummer storms arrived on schedule to douse the
fires. But the booms of thunder that send young children and old dogs
running for comfort bring what New Mexico's Pueblo Indians call male
rain--fast and furious--not the gentle, steady female rains that end
droughts.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is no stranger to fire and drought. We've learned from
past disasters, setting standards for fire-resistant building
materials and landscaping. Residents have cut per capita water
consumption, one low-flush toilet at a time, even as the region's
population grows.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, even after the driest year on record, even as we watch
flames lap perilously close to giant Sequoias and worry about houses
in tinder-dry canyons, Los Angeles remains a city of lawns and
illusions. More populated and prosperous than much of the West, true.
But more a part of it than we like to imagine.</TE>

<LD>President Bush speaks at every opportunity of the need for a "regime
change" in Iraq, one of the triumvirate in his axis of evil, but he
has yet to make the case for U.S. military action to remove Saddam
Hussein. Last week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee launched a
much-needed inquiry into that topic, raising the question not just of
how Hussein could be toppled but, more important, what sort of regime
might follow.</LD>
<LD>   From the day U.N. weapons inspectors entered Iraq after the Gulf
War, the Baghdad government tried to hide its stockpiles of chemical
and biological weapons and its nuclear weapons technology. Yet the
investigators found and destroyed biological weapons factories and
large quantities of chemical weapons, a major reason Baghdad has
refused entry to any inspectors since 1998 in defiance of U.N.
Security Council resolutions. Iraq is a regional threat, but how
great a danger it poses to the United States, or the world, now and
in the future is the key question.</LD>
<LD>   The committee chairman, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), said
the Bush administration supported the hearings, although it did not
want to participate yet. Eventually it must. If the administration
does decide to go forward, it should seek a congressional resolution
of support, as President Bush's father did after Baghdad's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.</LD>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld last week said he doubted
that inspectors would find everything if they were readmitted to
Iraq. That may be true, but pressing for their admission should be
the administration's top priority.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Britain's lukewarm support for a new military campaign,
Washington has no public backing from other countries. The U.S. case
would be stronger if it went the last mile to push for inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Baghdad invited the chief U.N. weapons inspector to
visit and talk. But more talk is unnecessary. In the end, Iraq must
let the inspectors go where they want, when they want.</TE>
<TE>   A strike against Iraq would require the use of bases in the
region. Prudence demands 100,000 troops or more; if the foe collapses
quickly, wonderful, but if not, be ready. There must be contingency
plans for street fighting in major cities and plans for
nation-building.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein has used chemical weapons before, against the Kurds in
Iraq and against Iran. It is not easy to predict when a nation will
use its weapons of mass destruction or what is necessary to deter
such use. Iraq did not use its chemical and biological weapons during
the Gulf War because it knew the response would be quick and
overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   The world would be better off without Saddam Hussein. But if he
does not pose an imminent threat, if there is not better intelligence
on his acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and readiness to
use them or provide them to terrorists, don't marshal the troops.</TE>

<LD>The state budget impasse has elected officials acting like stumblebum
prize fighters, standing at opposite sides of the ring and throwing
wild haymakers, none of them connecting.</LD>
<LD>   The state has gone more than a month without a budget for the
fiscal year that started July 1. Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and the
Democratic and Republican leaders of the state Assembly are posturing
hard, and no one cares. Missing altogether is the state Senate.
Senators passed their version of a $99-billion budget near the end of
June and went on vacation.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' Republican election foe, Bill Simon Jr., has insistently
used the budget as a campaign cudgel, even though he well knows that
there is no way to write a good budget under the deficit conditions
the state faces. The state treasury was left bare by vanishing
high-tech capital gains and stock options, among other things.</LD>
<TE>   If it seems there's no urgency to get the budget passed, it's
because the state controller is paying most major bills. The little
guys, the vendors who supply the Capitol with staples and paper
clips, aren't getting paid, but otherwise there is scant public
consequence. That may be about to change.</TE>
<TE>   A state court of appeal has ruled that the controller cannot make
major expenditures in the absence of a budget. If that is upheld by
the Supreme Court, state government will halt except for emergency
services. Perhaps that would be a good thing. There ought to be
consequences when the Legislature and governor fail to do the most
basic job they have.</TE>
<TE>   Judges shouldn't have to run the state, even when it faces a
budget shortfall of $24 billion, a gap larger than the entire budgets
of 44 states. But progress is stalled until Assembly Republicans give
up blocking the budget bill, withholding the few votes needed to
reach a two-thirds vote of approval.</TE>
<TE>   GOP leaders demand that the deficit be overcome by cuts alone,
although they won't produce specifics that add up to enough to close
the gap. They know such cuts would devastate state programs, from
health care to parks.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic budget contains about $4 billion in increased taxes
and fees. Cuts in state programs account for about $7 billion. The
rest is covered by loans, deferred spending and other gimmickry. It
is an ugly budget. The state would be more responsible if it
increased taxes more than the $4 billion, at least until the economy
rebounds. But nothing could make it painless.</TE>
<TE>   The Republicans think they are hurting Davis' chance for
reelection by holding the budget hostage. But voters don't care about
the ins and outs of a wild and fruitless political punching contest.
All they know is that their state legislators refuse to deal with a
tough situation.</TE>

<DH>Travel: Concessions are bouncing back from the slump,
thanks in part to longer waits for flights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After quickly passing through the security checkpoint at Pittsburgh
International Airport, passenger Mary Aleo found herself with loads
of time on her hands. So she dropped by Polished, a new airport
boutique that caters to women who want to look their best when they
board their planes.</LD>
<LD>   By the time she was done, Aleo, 44, had spent $200 on a massage,
manicure, skin care products and a touch-up to her makeup. She
enjoyed the pampering so much that she has visited the boutique three
times since that trip.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to customers like Aleo, business at Polished is running 20%
ahead of projections, owner Kristin Rhyne said. The company, which
also has a location at Boston's Logan International Airport, expects
to add three airport boutiques by the end of the year.</LD>
<TE>   Rhyne is not alone in her success. From fast food to fine dining,
oxygen bars to health clubs, airport businesses are staging a
remarkable comeback just 10 months after laying off thousands of
workers in the post-Sept. 11 travel industry slump that followed the
terrorist attacks. Today, many of them are rehiring employees and
experiencing a sharp rebound in sales, even though the number of
passengers nationwide remains down by about 11% .</TE>
<TE>   "If you had asked me on Sept. 12 if I'd thought we'd ever be where
we are today, I would have said no way," said William C. Anton,
founder of Anton Airfood Inc., a Washington-based operator of 124
restaurants in 20 airports, including 23 opened since the terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   At John Wayne Airport in Orange County, sales at two McDonald's
restaurants are up 10% compared with last year, after having fallen
by 60% in the weeks after the attacks, owner Isabelle Villasenor
said.</TE>
<TE>   At Los Angeles International Airport, passengers are snapping up
trendy $265 Oakley sunglasses at LA Edge, a "very Melrose Avenue and
Fred Segal" boutique that opened in late March, general manager
Crystal Bloom said.</TE>
<TE>   Several factors are driving the turnaround. Travelers arriving
early because of increased security measures are finding themselves
with long waits for their flights and little to do but shop. The
typical passenger now has close to an hour and a half of "I don't
know what to do with myself time," said Ira Weinstein, president of
Airport Interviewing and Research in White Plains, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Cutbacks in airline food service have led more people to grab a
bite before flying, said Deborah Meehan, president of SH&amp;E, an
aviation consulting group in Boston. And instead of going for fast
food, many travelers are dining at table-service restaurants such as
Legal Sea Foods.</TE>
<TE>   Airport retailing also has matured, said Pauline Armbrust, editor
of Airport Retail News. Upscale outfits such as Brooks Bros. and
Johnson &amp; Murphy now line concourses, giving passengers lots of
shopping choices.</TE>
<TE>   Not all airports and businesses are seeing a comeback. At LAX, for
instance, concessions sales were off 11% in May compared with a year
earlier. And shops in front of security checkpoints have suffered
because passengers worried about long waits now speed by them to get
into line.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the trends are heartening, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   HMSHost Corp., one of the largest operator of airport restaurants
and stores, reported that North American airport sales increased 2%
in the first three months this year, compared with a year earlier.
Atlanta-based Paradies Shops, a closely held firm that operates 300
shops at 59 airports, said sales at stores open at least a year, a
key industry measure, are up nearly 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Respite From Stress</TE>
<TE>   With flying more nerve-racking than ever for many travelers,
businesses that knead the knots out of people's necks, give them a
place to sweat out the stress or pour them a stiff drink are
flourishing. Although spas and bars are not new for airports, sales
have surged in the stressful post-Sept. 11 world.</TE>
<TE>   "People are worried about waiting in long lines, being abused as
they go through security, and then there's the anxiety of getting on
an airplane and sitting in the middle seat for a five-hour flight,"
said Michael Boyd of the Boyd Group, an aviation consulting company
in Evergreen, Colo. "Of course they want a massage or drink."</TE>
<TE>   Such is the case with Shaleka Lewis. This summer, the Palm Springs
secretary found herself stuck at Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport. With her return flight to Los Angeles delayed, she grew
edgy. Then Lewis stumbled upon Massage Bar, where she saw licensed
therapists administering rubdowns in the middle of the concourse.
Lewis, who rarely buys more than a cup of coffee or a small meal at an
airport, decided to shell out $35 for a 30-minute session, plus a $5 tip.</TE>
<TE>   She's glad she did. The massage did the trick, clearing her mind
and relaxing her body. "When I've flown in the past, I'd have a
couple of vodkas to calm down," said Lewis, 27, just before boarding
her plane. "Now, I don't need them."</TE>
<TE>   Massage Bar, which offers seated massages at Seattle-Tacoma and
Nashville International airports, is on track to posting revenue of
$1.3 million this year, up 30% from 2001, owner Cary Cruea said.
Business is so brisk at its Nashville location that the store extended its
operations to 12 hours a day from eight.  Cruea said she's in talks with
five airports about opening shops.</TE>
<TE>   The massage therapists also have benefited from all the new
business. Diane Messick said tips have shot up because grateful
customers are opening their wallets as never before. "When they get
out of the chair, they say, 'Thank you. Will you come home with me?
Will you marry me?' " Messick said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Soothing Treatments</TE>
<TE>   And massages might be a good preventive for air rage, said Kathryn
Gift, an Alaska Airlines flight attendant based in Seattle. Gift, who
visits Massage Bar about once a month, said passengers who get the
kinks rubbed out before boarding are among the most relaxed on her
flights.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway across the country at Detroit Metropolitan Airport,
passengers ease themselves into comfy leather chairs, put plastic
tubing into their nostrils and inhale a mixture of essential oils and
99% pure oxygen at OraOxygen, a spa that opened in March.</TE>
<TE>   OraOxygen, which also offers massages, manicures and pedicures, is
the brainchild of Suzanne Letourneau, who opened the first location
at Canada's Calgary International Airport in February 2000. A former
flight attendant and personal trainer, Letourneau said people who get
a boost of oxygen before flying are less likely to experience the
nausea, dehydration and fatigue associated with breathing
recirculated air on long plane trips.</TE>
<TE>   Beware. A full-body massage at OraOxygen can have a dangerously
mellowing effect. A man once missed his flight because he lost track
of time. Now staff members ask customers when their planes leave and
let them know whether they're cutting it too close.</TE>
<TE>   For travelers looking for something less New Age, McCarran
International Airport in Las Vegas features a 24 Hour Fitness center
where people can sweat out their stress. The gym, which has an
exercise room decorated like a runway, including white lines and blue
runway lights, opened two years ago to an underwhelming response. But
since the terrorist attacks, business has taken off, general manager
James Coty said.</TE>
<TE>   Student Mike Johnson recently stopped in before his flight to
Minneapolis. The 21-year-old business major used a treadmill for half
an hour, worked out with free weights and other equipment, showered,
took a sauna and then unwound with a 45-minute massage. For the
teetotaler Johnson, pumping iron "tires me out so I can fall asleep
and not have to worry about anything, like crashing."</TE>
<TE>   Only a few airports have beauty salons, spas and health clubs, but
most have bars. Not surprisingly, many travelers are turning to an
old standby, the bottle, to relieve tension and stave off boredom.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Lou Mazza. The general manager of Fat Tuesday's at
Pittsburgh International said business has never been better. Sales
at the daiquiri bar are up 10% to 15%, and Fat Tuesday's just added
desserts to its menu to boost the average check.</TE>
<TE>   But as good as the cheesecake and sandwiches are, passengers
aren't going there for the food.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to take the edge off," Mazza said.</TE>
<TE>   Barring new attacks, passenger counts should return to pre-attack
levels, giving a further boost to concessions operators, said O.B.
Schooley, an aviation consultant with SI Partners Inc. in Mission
Viejo. Airport restaurants and retailers also should benefit from
additional security measures that are likely to increase passenger
waiting times, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers' penchant for feasting and retail therapy has buoyed the
bottom line of many airport concessions operators. And when those
diversions aren't enough, people are increasingly turning to
religion.</TE>
<TE>   At John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, attendance
has been up significantly at the Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and
nondenominational chapels--prompting them to extend their hours.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Paul Hait, interim chaplain at JFK's International
Synagogue, said travelers, even non-Jews from countries such as Japan
and Ghana, are dropping by for spiritual sustenance.</TE>

<HD>Once Golden, Drug Firms Under Assault</HD>
<DH>Price pressure, generic competition and leaner profits
could spur more mergers and prompt some to cut research</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE and RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of basking in the glow of huge profits and a sterling
public image, the big brand-name drug companies are reeling from
attacks by senior citizen groups, AIDS activists and state and
federal regulators. The industry is under tremendous pressures that
experts say are likely to transform it in the coming decade and
perhaps even alter the flow of new drugs to the marketplace.</LD>
<LD>   For companies already vilified as price gougers by politicians,
consumer groups and executives at other firms, the recent stream of
bad news has been relentless: questionable accounting practices at
Merck &amp; Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.; dire warnings about Wyeth's
hormone replacement therapy; prolonged manufacturing deficiencies at
Eli Lilly &amp; Co.; a criminal probe at a Johnson &amp; Johnson plant in
Puerto Rico.</LD>
<LD>   All of this comes against a backdrop of eroding sales and earnings
as generic drugs steal market share from one blockbuster brand-name
drug after another, while Third World countries challenge the
worldwide drug patent system in order to get cheaper AIDS medicines.</LD>
<TE>   "Clearly there is a lot of upheaval and uncertainty in the
industry right now," said Merck's chairman and chief executive,
Raymond V. Gilmartin. He suggested that the industry was taking a
breather after a period of rapid product roll-outs in the 1990s. The
criticisms, he said, should subside if Congress passes a subscription
drug plan for the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   But the Senate last week killed legislation to provide Medicare
drug benefits, although it passed a bill that would give consumers
easier access to cheaper generic drugs, which was immediately
denounced by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,
the industry's main trade group.</TE>
<TE>   The association points out that drug makers have faced adversity
before and says it will overcome their current challenges. But their
two core problems--a dearth of new products in the pipeline and
mounting pressure on drug pricing--are widely seen as deep-seated and
long-term. And that suggests the $400-billion industry will be in for
a lengthy period of turmoil and change.</TE>
<TE>   "On the revenue side, they're likely to get kicked in the shin.
And on the product side, the well has run dry," said Uwe Reinhardt, a
Princeton University professor and expert on health-care economics
and policy. "It is not an easy future."</TE>
<TE>   In a recent conference call with analysts and reporters, Pfizer's
chief executive, Hank McKinnell, expressed amazement at the sudden
change affecting the industry, and referred wistfully to "the days
when the pharmaceutical companies were considered safe harbors for
investors."</TE>
<TE>   McKinnell blamed "irrational gloom" for the overall stock market
losses and general uncertainty about the industry. What the critics
have failed to notice, he said, is that "we're at a turning point for
our industry."</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a well-documented slowdown in the pipeline for new
drugs and there have been rapid rises in research and development
costs," McKinnell said.</TE>
<TE>   One key way that drug makers are expected to respond to these
challenges is through mergers, such as the $50-billion deal announced
last month by Pfizer and Pharmacia.</TE>
<TE>   Concentration of market power always raises the specter of higher
prices, but analysts say drug makers will be hard-pressed to put
through big increases, given the intense criticisms and scrutiny of
the industry's pricing and marketing practices. Unlike auto and
computer manufacturing, the drug industry is still quite fragmented.
Even with the Pharmacia acquisition, the market share for Pfizer,
already the industry's largest, will grow to just 11%.</TE>
<TE>   Consolidation, though, could have a substantial influence on the
development of new drugs. Pfizer and Pharmacia promoted their merger
largely as a way to enhance resources for research and create new
medicines. Their combined research and development budget, they said,
would amount to $7 billion, about 15% of their annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Bigger May Not Be Better</TE>
<TE>   But experts say the Pfizer-Pharmacia merger was more of a
short-term bet to bolster earnings. In fact, big drug mergers in the
past haven't led to more success in drug development, and the largest
research departments have been criticized for being inefficient and
lumbering.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the unfortunate thing, there's no evidence that bigger is
better when it comes to R&amp;D," said Patricia Danzon, a professor in
health-care systems at the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say they expect big drug companies eventually will
stop doing research, leaving it to biotech firms from which they
could get product licenses.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's R&amp;D budget, as a share of its overall revenue, has
declined slightly since the late 1990s, when it peaked at 20%, the
pharmaceutical association said.</TE>
<TE>   "These big pharmaceuticals are really morphing from research
companies into marketing companies," Reinhardt said. He expects major
companies to scale back on research and development.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of whether that comes to pass, it is apparent that the
industry is entering an era of leaner profits.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts point out that leading pharmaceutical companies still are
outperforming businesses in many other industries; demand for drugs
will grow as the nation's population ages. But for most brand-name
drug makers, the years of double-digit returns and profit growth
appear to be over.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook Grim for Year</TE>
<TE>   Drug industry analyst C. Anthony Butler of Lehman Bros. said in a
research note to clients last month that the industry is mired in
"what may be the worst year-over-year performance in earnings in the
past decade" and that "numerous company-specific mishaps have
poisoned investor confidence."</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that only seven new products have been approved for
sale this year--with maybe five more to come--compared with 27 drug
approvals last year and 26 the year before.</TE>
<TE>   The dimmed outlook has emerged in one company earnings report
after another. Merck, the world's third-biggest drug maker, said it
wasn't likely to show any earnings growth this year. The main reason:
Five of its leading drugs will lose their patent protection.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to its problems, Merck has been under fire for accounting
for $12 billion in revenue from its pharmacy-benefits subsidiary that
it never collected, even though that didn't affect the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis-based Lilly said its latest quarterly earnings
plunged 20%, then executives surprised analysts by saying they could
not provide any financial guidance for next year because of
uncertainties of the Food and Drug Administration's ongoing review of
its manufacturing operations, which could delay the launch of several
promising drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of one of Lilly's most famous products, the antidepressant
Prozac, have fallen precipitously since its patent expired last
August, opening the market to cheaper generic versions.</TE>
<TE>   Today, generic drugs comprise half of U.S. prescription sales, up
from less than 20% two decades ago. That share is expected to keep
rising as patents on top-selling drugs, such as the cholesterol
reducer Zocor and antidepressant Zoloft, expire in the next few
years.</TE>
<TE>   Backlash on Patents</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the drug industry is a victim of its own success.
Over the last decade, the industry launched a host of new products,
plus a bunch of me-too versions, and drove demand with aggressive
marketing. Consumers clamored for the drugs, doctors obliged, and the
drug companies reaped hefty margins because in most cases insurers
were paying the bills.</TE>
<TE>   But as insurers and others started pushing back against soaring
drug prices, the big drug makers hurt themselves more by aggressively
trying to extend patents, which caused a huge backlash in the courts
and the political arena.</TE>
<TE>   Many states, including California, have filed lawsuits against
pharmaceutical companies in the last year, claiming antitrust
violations and illegal manipulations of prescription drug prices. One
of the biggest is a lawsuit by 29 state attorneys general against
Bristol-Myers Squibb that accuses the company of illegally blocking
cheaper generic alternatives to its top-selling cancer drug, Taxol.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, more and more pharmaceutical firms are admitting that maybe
this was the wrong strategy and that they are going to readjust and
put more energy into new drug development," said Ken Kaitin, director
of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development.</TE>
<TE>   The drug industry always has dealt with patents expiring, but much
more now than in the past. That has put enormous pressure on
manufacturers to refill their pipelines. Last year, 31 new drugs hit
the U.S. market, compared with 52 a decade ago, the Center for
Medicines Research said.</TE>
<TE>   Development Slowdown</TE>
<TE>   A big part of the slowdown is the science. Researchers have
harvested chemical compounds to treat a number of ailments, but now
they are taking on more serious diseases such as cancer. And although
there are great hopes for the next generation of drugs based on the
mapping of the human genome, those undertakings will be more tricky,
expensive and time consuming. Analysts say it could be five to 10
years before companies see the fruits of human gene therapy.</TE>
<TE>   The Tufts Center estimates it costs $805 million and takes 10
to 15 years to bring a new drug to market. Yet only three in 10 drugs
have recouped that average cost.</TE>
<TE>   Citing such statistics, the pharmaceutical industry has defended
the high price of its drugs in the United States. But recent
controversies over the pricing of AIDS drugs in Africa, for example,
and the huge amounts spent in marketing to doctors and directly to
consumers have undermined that argument. That has made the public
highly suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, excessive
profiteering by drug companies was cited most often by consumers when
asked about why they thought health-care costs were
escalating.Meanwhile, managed-care companies are successfully pushing
more generic drugs in the marketplace, prodded by large employers
that are trying to keep costs under control. And as consumers are
required to pay larger amounts out of pocket for drugs--through more
sophisticated multi-tiered prescription plans--they will be making
their voices heard, especially the aging baby boomers.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure to make important drugs economically available is
going to become unbearable because the most politically active group
will be cruising into territory where they will need them," said Dr.
Peter Kongstvedt, a leader in the health-care consulting practice at
Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   All that should help consumers, at least in the short run. But for
the drug companies, it probably means their long, wonderful ride is
over.</TE>
<TE>   "They made hay while the sun was shining," said Reinhardt of
Princeton University. "Sooner or later, they were going to run into
this."</TE>

<TE>More Scrutiny</TE>
<TE>The drug industry is facing increasing pressure, both in the
courts and from state and federal regulators. Cases over the last few
months:</TE>
<TE>* AARP joined lawsuits against three drug companies in May, claiming
overcharging and antitrust violations in the blocking of comparable
generic drugs.</TE>
<TE>* An Alabama union health plan sued GlaxoSmithKline in June for
allegedly trying to block generic competition to its
$2-billion-a-year antibiotic Augmentin.</TE>
<TE>* The IRS sued GlaxoSmithKline for billions of dollars in unpaid
taxes in June, accusing the drug giant of hiding U.S. profit.</TE>
<TE>* The Minnesota attorney general sued Pharmacia in June for allegedly
overcharging for cancer treatment.</TE>
<TE>* California and 28 other states sued Bristol-Myers Squibb in
June over allegations that it illegally blocked cheaper generic
alternatives to the cancer drug Taxol.</TE>
<TE>* The AIDS Healthcare Foundation sued GlaxoSmithKline in July for
alleged antitrust violations and overcharging for three antiviral
drugs.</TE>
<TE>* Merck was hit with a class-action lawsuit in July alleging company
officers overstated company revenue for its pharmacy benefits unit.</TE>
<TE>* Eli Lilly settled a suit with eight states in July over allegations
the company accidentally released e-mail addresses of 600 people
taking Prozac.</TE>
<TE>* The drug industry sued the federal government in July to stop
Michigan from requiring pharmaceuticals to give Medicaid patients
steep discounts on some expensive medicines.</TE>
<TE>* In July, the Brazilian government offered to share its generic AIDS
drugs with impoverished countries, potentially cutting into
pharmaceutical company profits.</TE>
<TE>* A Food and Drug Administration panel in July said Bristol-Myers
Squibb's high blood pressure drug Vanlev was too risky to sell.</TE>
<TE>* The Securities and Exchange Commission announced in July that
it was investigating Bristol-Myers Squibb for allegedly inflating its
2001 revenue by $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>* Federal investigators began looking into record-keeping at a
Johnson &amp; Johnson plant in Puerto Rico where its controversial drug
Eprex is made.</TE>
<TE>* A New York federal judge is expected to rule this month on whether
AstraZeneca can extend its patent on the best-selling Prilosec ulcer
medication.

<DL></DL>
<LD>With corporate scandals in the headlines, you'd think the men who run
the world's major auto companies would recognize the perils of
arrogance. Yet William Clay Ford Jr. and other auto maker CEOs are
bringing in more lawyers to fight California's new emissions law
instead of telling their engineers to build the clean cars and trucks
Californians demand ["Car Makers to Challenge State's New Emissions
Law," July 26].</LD>
<LD>   Even though some companies already are selling cars with smart
technology that cuts global warming emissions, industry naysayers
claim the law, which gives them until the end of the decade to
deliver, moves too fast.</LD>
<LD>   They're saying "drop dead" to California without even trying.
Rather than sue, Mr. Ford and the others should put their experts to
work on the cleaner cars we need. Car makers have shown time and
again that they can deliver cleaner cars when they try.</LD>
<TE>   But first they have to get started. Courtroom challenges are a
giant step in the wrong direction.</TE>
<TE>   David G. Hawkins</TE>
<TE>   Director, National Resources</TE>
<TE>   Defense Council Climate Center</TE>
<TE>   Washington</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The reaction of the auto industry is proof that the new emissions
law is needed. U.S. auto makers seem more concerned with winning
court battles than with embracing a technological challenge and an
opportunity to come up to speed with the rest of the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Paul W. Rosenberger</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The legislation will help drivers save money at the pump and give
them more vehicle choices. Auto makers are using the same tired
arguments they've used to oppose safety belts, pollution laws and
fuel economy standards.</TE>
<TE>   The auto makers' can't-do attitude flies in the face of cleaner
hybrid cars that are already on California's roads. Plus, new studies
by the National Academy of Sciences and the Union of Concerned
Scientists show that off-the-shelf technology can reduce
heat-trapping gas emissions without sacrificing performance, size or
safety.</TE>

<TE>   Car makers miss the point when arguing that the fuel-efficient
cars that are currently produced are not being bought in sufficient
quantities. The technology used in these smaller cars, such as the
variable valve timing that Honda Civics had for years, is equally
applicable to larger cars, SUVs, trucks, and minivans. BMW, among
others, proved this with large-displacement V8 engines.</TE>
<TE>   It is not the technology, it is the lack of will on the part of
American manufacturers to apply it that is the problem.</TE>

<HD>Listen to Mom: Credit Card at 16 May Not Be Good Idea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I'm 16 and want to build my credit rating so I can buy a
car next year. My mom won't let me get a credit card, even though I
told her it will help me qualify later for a car loan. My aunt said
she might help. How do I talk her into it?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: You don't. Mom gets to rule on this one.</LD>
<LD>   Your ability to build a credit rating of your own right now is
pretty limited because you're still a minor. Minors can't legally be
held to a contract, so lenders aren't going to extend you credit
unless someone else is also on the hook to repay the loan.</LD>
<TE>   That doesn't change simply because you get a credit card. You're
still going to need a co-signer to get a car loan next year, since
you won't yet be 18.</TE>
<TE>   If you tick off your mom by going around her to get the card, you
can pretty much count out her help in co-signing for a car loan. And
Auntie Mame might not be so willing to help you after she endures
Mom's wrath.</TE>
<TE>   What you can do now, with your mom's permission, is open checking
and savings accounts. Having such accounts is important in starting a
credit history.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've had the accounts for several months, apply for a debit
card. Debit cards are now accepted most places that credit cards are
and can help you learn how to handle plastic. The difference is that
charges made to debit cards are deducted directly from your checking
account, so it's pretty hard to charge more than you can repay.</TE>
<TE>   Once you're 18 and in college, you'll have no shortage of
opportunities to get a card. Learning to handle a checking account
and debit card in the meantime is a good way to get ready.</TE>
<TE>   You also might reconsider the idea of getting a car loan in the
first place. You're usually much better off paying cash for cars and
other items that lose value.</TE>
<TE>   Include Life Insurance</TE>
<TE>   in Estate Planning</TE>
<TE>   Q: You recently mentioned that people whose net worth was
approaching $1 million should see an estate-planning attorney. You
probably also should mention that people should include the face
value of any life insurance policies. These amounts don't show up in
net worth because they aren't technically assets or liabilities, but
they can be a large part of the taxable estate of the surviving
spouse. Because this easily can be addressed through proper estate
planning (by using trusts, for example), these folks definitely
should see an estate attorney too.</TE>
<TE>   A: Good point. Hefty life insurance policies can be a godsend for
your survivors, but can wreak havoc with estate planning if not
properly handled.</TE>
<TE>   Weigh Tax Implications</TE>
<TE>   Before Selling Home</TE>
<TE>   Q: My mother-in-law transferred her home to my husband in 1992. In
2000, she went into a nursing home and we sold the house, paying
capital gains on the difference between the sale price and what she
paid for the house. Since then, we have heard that we didn't need to
pay those taxes. Is that true, and if so, how do we get a refund?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's true that had you done things differently, you easily
could have avoided those taxes. Because of the way you handled this,
however, you pretty much locked in a big tax bill.</TE>
<TE>   If your mother-in-law had kept the house and it was sold after she
went into the nursing home, she could have avoided taxes on at least
$250,000 of profit. Every homeowner is entitled to exclude that much
profit on the sale of a home, provided she has lived in the house for
at least two of the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   Taxes on the home sale also could have been avoided if your
husband's mother had kept the house and bequeathed it to her son. The
house then would have been revalued for tax purposes, receiving
what's known as a "step up" in its tax basis. Translated, that means
your husband could have sold the house shortly after her death
without owing any taxes.</TE>
<TE>   You can't turn back the clock, but this is a valuable lesson.
Don't make decisions about major assets without consulting a tax pro
who can walk you through the financial implications of your choices.</TE>

<LD>Judy Thomas has three words of advice for consumers who are trying to
eradicate incorrect information from their credit reports: Doc,
document, document.</LD>
<LD>   "Every conversation I had, I have a note on," Thomas said of her
six-year battle to correct her credit report. "It may not be perfect
form. It might not even have a date on it, but it included all the
information that I could get."</LD>
<LD>   The 57-year-old Oregon real estate broker last week won the
largest award in history for violations of the federal Fair Credit
Reporting Act--$5.3 million--in a case against Trans Union, one of
the nation's three big credit reporting companies. Chicago-based
Trans Union said it was disappointed with the ruling but has not
determined whether it will appeal, spokesman Clark Walter said.</LD>
<TE>   Lawsuits filed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which
typically allege that a credit reporting company failed to correct
inaccurate items on consumer credit reports as required under the
law, are relatively rare, attorneys note. Big cases, in which the
consumer wins more than a token amount, are even rarer. Only a
handful of consumers have won more than $100,000, said Andy
Henderson, a Los Angeles attorney who has litigated several such
cases. Many cases are settled before trial for undisclosed amounts.</TE>
<TE>   The reason few cases go to trial is that they're complicated and
costly to litigate, attorneys said. Consumers rarely have enough
money to pay hourly legal fees, so lawyers take only those cases they
think are strong enough to promise decent contingency fees, which are
based on a percentage of the damages awarded.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the number of lawsuits and size of damage awards are
growing as more people discover errors on their credit reports--the
detailed credit histories that determine whether a consumer can get a
loan to buy such things as a house or car, and what interest rate
they'll have to pay.</TE>
<TE>   The rapid spread of identity theft--in which stolen personal
information is used to open bogus credit accounts--has contributed to
the rise because the thief's credit activity appears on the
victimized consumer's report.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas' story reveals the reason consumers who have never thought
about their credit records need to keep tabs on what the credit
reporting companies are saying about them. It also provides a guide
for handling problems when they arise.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial of Thomas' lawsuit, a Trans Union representative
testified that the company uses computerized algorithms to match
credit data with the right consumers. But because numbers are
sometimes juxtaposed, miskeyed or misread, these programs disregard a
certain number of mistakes, including name, address, Social Security
number or birth date.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Two files can become merged because one consumer's
name or Social Security number is similar to another's. And similar
is a relative term, said David A. Szwak, a consumer attorney in
Louisiana. For instance, Szwak sued a credit company for confusing
Myra S. Coleman with Maria S. Gaiytan. The company maintained at that
trial that Myra could be a nickname for Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "The mismerge of credit reports is a very big problem," Szwak
testified during the trial of Thomas' suit. "I have seen hundreds of
cases like this."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas' woes started when she moved to Oregon from California.
Another woman living in the Northwest had a similar first
name--Judith--and a similar Social Security number, and that's all it
took, she said, for their credit files to be merged.</TE>
<TE>   The next thing she knew, Thomas had an "a.k.a." or "also known as"
appended to her file that said she had an alternate identity and
another address. The other woman was born in the same year as Thomas,
but not on the same date. Her Social Security number differed from
Thomas' by one digit. She had a different last name and lived in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   She also had serious credit problems--which began to show up on
Thomas' credit report.</TE>
<TE>   "You think about it," Thomas said. "Social Security numbers have
nine digits. How many numbers could be one digit off yours? How
likely is it that one of those people has your first name? That was
their corroboration that it was me. It was another Judy in the
Northwest. That's all it took."</TE>
<TE>   More frustrating, Thomas said, was the way Trans Union handled the
problem. According to trial testimony, she repeatedly explained that
she was not the other Judy, but Trans Union failed to take the other
woman's information off her credit file. And creditors continued to
treat Thomas as a poor risk.</TE>
<TE>   But what set Thomas' lawsuit apart was what she did to try to
correct the problem, her attorneys said. She tracked down the other
Judy and wrote her a letter. The other Judy wrote back attesting to
the fact that she was a different person--no relation--and didn't
belong on Thomas' credit file. Thomas sent that letter, along with
her own protest, to Trans Union. She kept copies.</TE>
<TE>   She made phone calls. She kept notes. When she was unable to get
the credit company to eliminate the other Judy's credit woes from her
report, she contacted the creditors directly--providing the correct
information about who she was and pointing out that she was not
related to the other woman. The creditors acknowledged, in writing,
that Thomas was right. She sent the letters to Trans Union with a
note--and kept copies.</TE>
<TE>   She created a file folder. It expanded to fill a briefcase and
then a storage box. She never threw out a letter or her notes.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my security blanket," she said. "I figured that if I
needed credit during that time, I could take it to the lender and
show them what I had been through."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it was a jury that sorted through Thomas' box of
records chronicling the frustration of a woman who was misidentified
for six years--despite a protracted effort to prove who she was and
wasn't. The federal jury in Portland awarded her $300,000 in
compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson? If you find your credit report sullied by someone
else's data, do what Thomas did, said attorney Mike Baxter,
co-counsel in Thomas' case: Doc, document, document.</TE>

<HD>Consumers Responsible for Keeping Eye on Credit File</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Fair Credit Reporting Act, revised in 1999, is aimed at ensuring
that consumer credit reports are accurate. These reports, which
detail the way consumers handle their bills, can dictate how much you
pay for a loan, whether you can get new credit or insurance and even
whether you'll be hired for a specific job.</LD>
<LD>   Under the law:</LD>
<LD>   * You have the right to a free credit report if you are turned
down for credit based on information in your file.</LD>
<TE>   * You can dispute inaccurate items in the report and have them
investigated promptly.</TE>
<TE>   * Inaccurate or unverified items must be deleted from your file
within 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   * You must be notified if previously deleted items are reinserted
on your report.</TE>
<TE>   But consumers must enforce these rights themselves. Some industry
experts suggest consumers get a copy of their credit file annually to
ensure its accuracy. Anyone who wants to verify the accuracy of a
credit report when they haven't been denied credit, however, must pay
a fee to get a copy of their file. Generally the fee is $8 per
person, but it's advisable to get reports from all three of the big
credit reporting companies because they don't always share
information.</TE>
<TE>   To get a copy of your credit report, call:</TE>
<TE>   * Equifax: (800) 685-1111</TE>
<TE>   * Experian: (888) 397-3742</TE>
<TE>   * Trans Union: (800) 916-8800</TE>
<TE>   If you find inaccurate items on a report, be sure to keep records
of your efforts to clear them up, attorneys say.</TE>
<TE>   You'll need these documents to complain to the Federal Trade
Commission, which monitors compliance with the fair credit act, if
the credit reporting company does not comply with the law. If the
problem proves intractable, these records are pivotal in lawsuits
too.</TE>
<TE>   To find an attorney specializing in consumer credit problems,
contact the Privacy Rights Clearing House or the Identity Theft
Resource Center, which keep lists of legal specialists in this area.
Both organizations can be contacted through their Web sites at
www.privacyrights.org and www.idtheft.org.</TE>

<HD>For Stocks, Reaching a Bottom Is a Process</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street desperately wants to believe that the stock market has
bottomed.</LD>
<LD>   But the market, as is often the case, seems to have other
ideas--starting with the already-crushed technology sector.</LD>
<LD>   Some analysts say a critical issue for many tech stocks now is
"overhead supply": Some companies have so many billions of shares
outstanding that the selling pressure may remain enormous whether the
stocks fall further or attempt to rally.</LD>
<TE>   Share prices in general plunged anew late last week, taking back a
hefty chunk of the gains racked up in the rally that followed the
five-year lows reached July 23.</TE>
<TE>   Blame for the latest sell-off, however, was pinned not on the
growing ranks of alleged corporate felons but on a more traditional
suspect: the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The government's report Friday that the economy created a net
6,000 new jobs in July, far below expectations, fanned worries of a
"double dip"--another recession hard on the heels of last year's
downturn.</TE>
<TE>   That would be trouble enough for many companies. But the action in
the market late last week suggested that the prospect of a second
recession would be particularly devastating for the tech sector,
where trillions of dollars in market value already have been
obliterated since prices peaked in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 4.3% from Tuesday's
close through Friday, when it finished at 864.24--still 8.3% above
its five-year closing low of 797.70 reached July 23.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a number of tech stock indexes on Friday fell through
their July lows to their worst levels since at least the late 1990s.
They included the Goldman Sachs software stocks index, the SOX
semiconductor index and the Interactive Week Internet index.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq 100, which includes the biggest tech stocks in that
market, closed at a five-year low of 892.51 on Friday, skidding
through the July 23 close of 896.82. The index had jumped 9.3%
between July 23 and last Tuesday, raising hopes that the 29-month-old
bear market had finally been vanquished.</TE>
<TE>   John Bollinger, who writes the Capital Growth Letter investment
report from Manhattan Beach, said last week that the classic chart
formation of market bottoms since World War II has been a W--meaning
that market indexes typically hit an initial low, rally for a time
thereafter, then fall back to levels either close to the initial low
or under it.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, only after that second low, or series of lows, can a new
bull market begin, Bollinger said.</TE>
<TE>   But second and final lows in these W-formations generally don't
occur quickly after the initial low, he said. On average since 1949,
final bottoms have been reached 10 to 15 weeks after the initial low.</TE>
<TE>   If July 23 marked the initial low for most stocks in this bear
market--something that will be evident only in retrospect, of
course--prices may now be in a bottoming process that could last into
October, Bollinger said.</TE>
<TE>   The point being, he said, that investors should be prepared for
more pain, and that long-term bargain hunters must accept that stocks
they buy now could get even cheaper before they hit their absolute
lows.</TE>
<TE>   The positive view of this bottoming process is that investors who
are looking to buy shouldn't feel rushed, Bollinger noted.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, some companies in the beaten-down tech sector
may face a special problem regardless of whether the market goes
lower or higher from here.</TE>
<TE>   Companies including Oracle Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc., Cisco
Systems Inc. and AOL Time Warner Inc. have literally billions of
shares outstanding, the legacy of the tech sector's boom years in the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle, for example, has 5.5 billion shares in the market. That's
more than blue-chip giants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (4.4 billion
outstanding) and Coca-Cola Co. (2.5 billion).</TE>
<TE>   There is no way to know the average share price paid by Oracle's
current investors. But with the stock at $9.41 on Friday, compared
with the peak of $46 in 2000, it's a reasonable assumption that many
of the company's buy-and-hold investors are far under water.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors who bought the shares in recent months, however,
still may have a paper profit: The stock fell as low as $7.32 on June
3, and rallied as high as $10.47 by July 17.</TE>
<TE>   If the stock continues to lose ground in the near term, more
investors who bought recently may be tempted to sell, to escape with
at least some gain.</TE>
<TE>   Longer-term, if the stock continues to rise, more investors who
bought before this year may be tempted to exit as they get closer to
even.</TE>
<TE>   This is an issue for the market overall, not just for the tech
giants; it's the reason many analysts believe stocks in general face
a slow recovery in the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   But the sheer number of shares outstanding from the big tech
companies--the "overhead supply"--raises the risk of greater selling
pressure, either way they go.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean these stocks can't eventually rebound
significantly, if the companies' fundamentals improve accordingly.
"But when you have that kind of supply ... it tends to make it more
difficult," said Tim Hayes, senior equity strategist at investment
data firm Ned Davis Research in Nokomis, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   After the "Nifty Fifty" blue-chip stocks crashed in 1973-74, the
recovery time for some of those stocks was measured in years, not in
months, Bollinger said. And for some, he noted, there was no
recovery.</TE>

<LD>Stock Market Falters but Has Gain for Week</LD>
<LD>   What started out as an upbeat week on Wall Street quickly turned
sour as a series of disappointing economic reports threatened the
U.S. economic recovery and sparked a sell-off in the stock market.</LD>
<LD>   Despite slumping Thursday and Friday, the Dow Jones industrial
average managed to eke out a gain of less than 1% for the week,
giving it back-to-back weekly advances for the first time since
March. But the Nasdaq composite index finished the week with a loss
of 1.1% as tech stocks continued to stumble.</LD>
<TE>   The sell-off raised questions about the durability of the market's
recent rebound, which had seen stock prices bounce back dramatically
from the multiyear lows they reached last month.</TE>

<TE>   Bush Signs Accounting Reform Legislation</TE>
<TE>   President Bush signed accounting reform legislation into law as
corporate executives, auditors, lawyers and Wall Street analysts
braced for a significant change in the way they do business.</TE>
<TE>   Bush stressed the punitive aspects of the most far-reaching
business reforms since the Depression--measures that appeared all but
dead a few months ago. "No more easy money for corporate criminals,
just hard time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the prospect of tough prison sentences for white-collar
criminals has captured the spotlight, experts say the law's most
sweeping changes concern corporate governance.</TE>

<TE>   2 Former WorldCom Executives Arrested</TE>
<TE>   Continuing their high-profile crackdown on corporate corruption,
federal authorities arrested two former executives of WorldCom Inc.,
the phone company that rocked Wall Street last month by admitting
massive accounting irregularities and then filing the nation's
largest bankruptcy case.</TE>
<TE>   Former Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan and former
Controller David F. Myers surrendered to FBI agents in New York and
were charged with seven criminal counts of fraud, conspiracy and
submitting false statements to the Securities and Exchange
Commission. They are accused of hiding $3.9 billion in expenses in
2001 and 2002 to make WorldCom appear profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities did not take action against the company or its
high-profile and controversial former chairman, Bernard J. Ebbers.
But Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and other law enforcement officials
characterized the investigation as fast-moving and aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on condition of anonymity, Justice Department officials
said several other WorldCom executives are under investigation for
possible criminal wrongdoing and could face charges.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann CEO Quits Amid Rift With Board</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Middelhoff resigned as chairman and chief executive of
Bertelsmann after a showdown with the company's supervisory board
over the direction of the German media giant.</TE>
<TE>   The board opposed Middelhoff's long-standing plan to take
Bertelsmann public. They also rejected Middelhoff's proposal for
Bertelsmann's founding family to dilute its 75% stake in the
Bertelsmann Foundation, which holds a majority of Bertelsmann's
stock.</TE>
<TE>   Middelhoff was the latest media baron to lose his job as the
world's largest entertainment conglomerates come under increasing
shareholder scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Inc. Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Pittman and
Vivendi Universal Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier resigned under
pressure last month.</TE>
<TE>   Middelhoff's departure put the fate of song-swapping service
Napster in doubt. He had made two investments in the Redwood
City-based Internet firm for a combined $85 million and agreed to buy
Napster's assets for $8 million more through a bankruptcy auction
scheduled for this month.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Opens Investigation of Accounting at AOL</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department opened a preliminary criminal investigation
against AOL Time Warner Inc. amid allegations that its Internet unit
fudged revenue numbers.</TE>
<TE>   The media giant staunchly defended its practices and portrayed
itself as a victim of the recent spate of corporate scandals, which
have made regulators more aggressive in cracking down on accounting
gimmicks and investor fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The company announced July 24 that the Securities and Exchange
Commission had launched a "fact-finding inquiry" into questions
raised by a Washington Post article that said the company used
"unconventional" accounting practices to increase its advertising
revenue by about $270 million from July 2000 to March 2002.</TE>

<TE>   Boston Bank Agrees to Buy Family Savings</TE>
<TE>   Boston Bank of Commerce agreed to acquire Family Savings Bank of
South Los Angeles in a deal that would create the nation's largest
black-owned bank.</TE>
<TE>   Boston Bank last year purchased Founders National Bank, another
African American-owned bank in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but people familiar with the
deal, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Boston Bank agreed to
pay $12 million for Family Savings, topping an $11-million offer by
FBOP, an Illinois-based bank.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GE to Treat Stock Options as Expense</TE>
<TE>   General Electric Co. said it would count employee stock options
against earnings for the first time, giving momentum to the backlash
against the perk that made many executives rich during the stock
market bubble.</TE>
<TE>   GE, the nation's most valuable company, said it would start
treating options as a cost this quarter to bolster the integrity of
its accounting, and some analysts said GE's stature could prompt
waves of other companies to follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola Co. last month became the first major company to count
options as a normal business expense in reaction to the corporate
bookkeeping scandals. A few others adopted the practice, including
Amazon.com Inc., but most companies balked at the idea, saying it
would significantly reduce their profits. With GE expensing options,
however, "the dam should break" in terms of other companies matching
the move, said Robert Friedman, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</TE>

<TE>   Qwest Communications International Inc. admitted misreporting at
least $1.16 billion in revenue and said it may take months to restate
its financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   The improper bookkeeping, which will force restatement of
financial results for 2000 and 2001, heightened fears that the
Denver-based telecommunications company may be felled by its
$26-billion debt.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Notebaert, who replaced longtime Chief Executive Joseph
Nacchio in June, said the company improperly accounted for sales of
telecommunications capacity on its fiber-optic network from 1999
through 2001 and also made mistakes recording equipment sales and
accounting for certain expenses.</TE>

<TE>   IBM to Acquire Unit of Pricewaterhouse</TE>
<TE>   IBM Corp. agreed to buy the consulting arm of
PricewaterhouseCoopers for $3.5 billion in cash and stock in a bid to
dominate the lucrative technology service business.</TE>
<TE>   PwC Consulting would join IBM's Global Services unit, which has
surpassed Big Blue's storied computer hardware division as its most
lucrative venture.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition also would cement IBM's position as the world's
largest technology services company, with annual revenue of $40
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Buying the unit also gives IBM management consultants, broadening
its services beyond those of most competitors.</TE>

<LD>Re "Teen Denies Provoking Police Jabs," July 31: I am a white man who
has lived with a black person for nearly 20 years. I have seen the
background features of this Inglewood incident--the teen being told
to drop his potato chips, five officers involved, handcuffing for an
expired license check--countless times with my roommate, his family
and friends. The enormous show of force by the officers, who it seems
weren't otherwise paying attention to anything going on, has never
happened to me or my family. But it's a fact of life to the black
people I am involved with. There's just usually nobody around with a
camera.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "101 Ways to Ease Congestion Narrowed to a Few," July 31: Once
again, homeowner "representatives" Gerald Silver, president of the
Coalition of Freeway Residents, and Richard Close, president of the
Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., make haste to silence any and all
discussion of new transportation strategies for the West Valley.
Close even goes so far as to warn: "If an earthquake comes ... having
a double-deck could destroy the whole freeway." Right.</LD>
<LD>   So what are we left with after all these years of leadership? We
have a beautiful subway--that terminates at Universal City. And we
have yet to hear a single constructive idea. I shudder to think what
it would be like to live in "Camelot" with these leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Bliss</LD>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Air rushes in to fill a vacuum; water flows to the lowest level
... and commuters will surely fill any new freeway expansion. And,
fill it they will, to the point that congestion becomes intolerable.
And then, once again, politicians, commuters and developers will cry
for more freeway expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The consultants state that if nothing is done, by 2025 it would
take 99 minutes to make the trip from Thousand Oaks to downtown Los
Angeles, according to projections. Does it occur to the consultants
that very few L.A. commuters would move to Thousand Oaks if the
commute were to take 99 minutes? In other words, the growth in travel
time will simply zero out at a level barely tolerable to the masses.
That time may be greater than you or I would tolerate, but it would
be just barely acceptable to the "last commuter in."</TE>
<TE>   So should we spend gazillions building new lanes/elevated
structures while dislocating residents or should we rely on the
judgment of commuters to locate their homes and places of work where
safety and sanity prevails?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I disagree with the Aug. 1 editorial that supports repealing the
Kansas (and all) criminal libel laws. While I support a strong free
press, I am troubled by recent changes. Previously sacrosanct
firewalls between the news division, management and advertising have
been breached, and news gathering departments have been reduced,
requiring reporters to rely on more limited sources for the facts.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the federal media regulations have been repealed, allowing
single entities to control multiple media outlets in a single market.
These mega-media conglomerates wield tremendous power, and they have
influenced legislation and even the electoral process. While such
influence is a disturbing gray area, a single libelous claim can
totally corrupt the political process. This must not be allowed. And
the only effective way to prevent such abuse, as recent financial
scandals have taught us, is to have criminal statutes.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "County to Seek Tax Hike for Hospitals," July 30: I find it
appalling that in arguing for the support of a tax increase to
maintain L.A. County emergency room services, Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky would make the statement that we all are "one drunk
driver away, one gunshot away, one stabbing away from a trauma
center."</LD>
<LD>   Something is terribly wrong in our city if daily gunshots,
stabbings and drunk drivers are so acceptable as the status quo that
a supervisor uses them to justify increasing our taxes. Perhaps, in
addition to funding our much-needed health-care system, Yaroslavsky
ought to turn his attention to determining a way to prevent these
criminal acts (instead of speaking of them so flippantly) and making
the county more livable.</LD>
<LD>   Miles Crakow</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted to place on the
November ballot a measure to increase property taxes to help pay for
emergency health care. The bulk of the new taxes will be paid by the
residential homeowners of Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency health care is to be used by everyone who is living,
working, traveling or visiting in Los Angeles County. Placing the tax
burden on homeowners is unfair. Since the supervisors do not have the
courage to make the necessary budget cuts to establish the priorities
of its citizens and visitors, voters should reject this sneaky tax
increase.</TE>
<TE>   A better way to equitably finance consistent emergency health care
is through a state sales tax that would benefit everyone in
California, regardless of where he or she lives.</TE>

<LD>   The latest news of the jury decision requiring [Republican
gubernatorial candidate] Bill Simon's firm to pay $78 million in
damages for "fraud and other misconduct" leaves voters with only one
reasonable choice in the next gubernatorial election: write-in votes
for [former Los Angeles Mayor] Richard Riordan.</LD>
<LD>   I'm a Democrat, and that's what I had planned to do all along.
There is a danger in this, though. A split vote could result in Simon
winning the election.</LD>

<LD>"Orange County's 'Great Park' Comes With a Great Price Tag" (July 29)
cites critics who inaccurately characterize the Navy's cleanup
efforts at the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. It suggests
that cleanup costs will adversely affect purchasers of the property.
Both are incorrect.</LD>
<LD>   The Department of the Navy's record of cleanup at this site and
others stands as testimony to the effectiveness of its environmental
remediation program. The Navy cleans up the bases it returns to the
public to standards set for it by the federal government and the
applicable state government. Federal law not only requires that we
complete all cleanup before the sales are complete, but it also
requires that we indemnify the new owners if we find contamination
later on that is attributable to our operations.</LD>
<LD>   We remain fully committed to funding the cleanup of El Toro, which
is actively ongoing at several sites on the base, and standing by our
commitments in the future.</LD>

<LD>Residential consumers of electricity are still being urged to

<LD>   The private corporations that caused the California "energy
crisis" of 2000 aren't making the money they once were with
electricity shell games and have again found a way to keep prices
artificially inflated. Why, in this brave new era of corporate

<LD>Re "Blast Kills 7 at University in Jerusalem," Aug. 1: The stark
contrast between the Palestinian joy at the slaughter of students at
Hebrew University and the investigation of the Israeli government
about the "innocent lives" lost due to errant intelligence in the
targeting of a Hamas mega-murderer is amazing.</LD>
<LD>   These two opposites say volumes about the moral base of today's
Islam. Reciting the mantra of the Palestinian Authority that
everything terrorists do is because of "the occupation" just adds one
more proof that the teachings of hate from infancy have borne bitter
fruit indeed.</LD>
<LD>   How can a people that so celebrates death and destruction ever be
a part of the family of nations? Is there no person brave enough to
stand up and say that the God we both accept must be weeping at the
glaring lack of compassion evident in the followers of Allah?</LD>

<TE>   As a kid growing up in a world gone mad with the attempted and
largely successful extermination of the Jews, and the mass
dispossession of the Palestinians, I heard "Jewish state, Jewish
state, Jewish state." It was the drumbeat of my childhood. Now I have
an idea. Let the Palestinians have a state, just as the Israelis do.
Maybe that will stop the violence.</TE>

<TE>   Five innocent Americans are ruthlessly murdered for choosing to

<TE>   The Palestinians accuse Israel of a "cycle of violence" and try to
equate this act with the killing of a coldblooded war criminal. This
after Israel has extended the hand of peace numerous times in Oslo,
Camp David, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the perpetrators are not prosecuted or pursued by the
Palestinian Authority, neighboring Arab states offer no condemnation,
and Palestinians celebrate the murder of these Americans in the
streets of Gaza.</TE>

not given away someone else's land to foreign refugees (Europe's

self-determination and a colossal historic mistake for which the
United States has paid dearly over the decades, culminating in the

<HD>Adopt, Then Adapt</HD>
<DH>Trans-racial families face unique challenges of prejudice
and identity</DH>

<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CONCORD, Calif.</DL>
<LD>David Glotzer and Charlotte Meyer adopted their first child 11 years
ago. They flew the birth mother to San Francisco from North Carolina
and put her up with Meyer's sister. They were in the hospital room
when Aaron came into the world. Four years later, the white couple
adopted a daughter, Hannah, so their African American son would have
a sister of the same race.</LD>
<LD>   Then their life began to change in directions they could not have
anticipated. They moved from San Francisco to Oakland to be in a
mostly black community. They enrolled their children in a mostly
black Catholic school. And they began to experience racism, through
their children. It shocked them. And it hurt.</LD>
<LD>   "Your sense of identity changes," says Glotzer. "You go from being
Caucasian to a family of color."</LD>
<TE>   At a time when the Bush administration is pushing adoption from
foster care--launching the first federal adoption Web site late last
month and creating a series of public service commercials featuring
Bruce Willis and the first lady--an increasing number of adoptions
are trans-racial. And the success of such adoptions, whether through
foster care, private agencies or attorneys, requires more than simply
matching a child with a loving family. Trans-racial families often
experience uniquely challenging issues of race and identity.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Plut and his wife, Hazel White, have a 4-year-old adopted
African American son named Jake. Jake attends a private preschool in
San Francisco that Plut estimates is 40% minority and 60% white. Plut
serves on the school's board of directors and is working to introduce
the school to some of the methods and activities proposed in a book
called "Anti-Bias Curriculum: Tools for Empowering Young Children."
He said he is just trying to be proactive.</TE>
<TE>   "We are white parents. We don't know what it is like to grow up
black in America. Looking back, I know I was a sheltered white person
in a white community. I remember how my peers and everyone talked
about race. It is not a comfortable feeling to know this is what you
were taught, how you absorb racism as a child.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always thought of myself as a person who wasn't racist. But
when you actually start learning about it or are very close to it,
you realize you didn't even know."</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, about 30% of an estimated 50,000 adoptions from
foster care involved at least one parent whose race is different from
that of the child, according to the Department of Health and Human
Services. Trans-racial adoption has increased steadily in the last
five years, largely as a result of federal legislation to get
children out of foster care, but it remains a hot-button issue. This
is particularly true when the parents are white and the children are
black, reflecting, perhaps, lingering racial tensions in American
society at large.</TE>
<TE>   "It is no surprise that families with black children have more
complexity," said Adam Pertman, author of "Adoption Nation, How the
Adoption Revolution is Transforming America." "Racism in America is
focused primarily on African Americans. The cultural stereotypes
about Asians [and Latinos] are not as bad as they are about blacks."</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing these unique challenges, the health and human services
agency annually awards $2.5 million in grants to help move minority
children to adoption. Federal money is also available for training
and education of parents adopting trans-racially; in July, these
funds helped a group of more than 100 parents from across the country
come together for the first trans-racial summit. The conference,
which took place in this city just west of San Francisco, was
sponsored by Pact, a nonprofit adoption organization based in
Richmond, Calif., that has also received a federal grant to study
trans-racial adoptive families.</TE>
<TE>   For four days the parents, most of them white, attended workshops
on everything from issues for Chinese girls, to African American hair
and skin care, to Latin American identity and how to talk about
racism with your kids.</TE>
<TE>   Passionate Debate on Where to Live</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most heated of the sessions was one on how to make
connections to racial groups that evolved into a passionate debate
about where multiracial families should live. Agonizing decisions
that tap into issues of race and class sprang vividly to life. One
mother told of her difficulty making friends with black adults. "It's
not as easy as saying, 'I have a black child, can you be my friend?'
" she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to pick up and move," another mother told the room of
parents. "It's about your child's comfort zone. To pick your comfort
zone over your child's is selfish." She told of how she had moved her
family to a very diverse community in the Midwest when her African
American daughter reached high school age, so that the daughter could
forge African American friends on her own.</TE>
<TE>   A woman across the room challenged that wisdom. She has adopted
two children from Paraguay and now lives in what she describes as a
"very WASP community in Los Angeles." Her children go to an elite,
mostly white private school, but she hosts numerous cultural events
at her house to keep her children in touch with their roots. She has
traveled with her 7-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son to Paraguay
to let them see their native country. She and her husband made a
documentary film, "Building Bridges," about the experience. She hired
a Paraguayan to work in her office so her children would have access
to an adult from their country. She has done a lot, she says. She
does not feel she has to move her kids to a poorer, ethnic
neighborhood to hook them up with their culture.</TE>
<TE>   Parents around the room jumped on her. "Not all people of color
are poor," shouted one woman. "That's your assumptions!"</TE>
<TE>Joseph Crumbley, an African American therapist and social worker who
has been a consultant to the Los Angeles County Children and Youth
Services in the area of trans-racial adoption, was sitting in on the
discussion. He leapt to the defense of the poor. "I don't want to say
that nothing good can come from being poor," Crumbley said. "My
parents made sure I was comfortable going into the ghetto, hanging
out in the 'hood. Most of the people in their race may not be rich.
They need to be able to know how to walk through the 'hood, and know
how to deal with law enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   An Increase in Adoptions From Foster Care</TE>
<TE>   In 1996 a federal law imposed penalties on states or adoption
agencies that delay moving children out of foster care while seeking
adoptive parents of the same race as the child. Further federal
legislation in 1997 stated that agencies had to strive to find
permanent homes for children--permanent foster care is not an
acceptable option. Incentive bonuses are now given to states for
increasing the number of children put into adoption.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been a 78% increase in the number of adoptions from
foster care in the last four years, according to the Department of
Health and Human Services. Black children made up 38% of those
adopted from foster care in 2001, according to federal statistics.
Latino children make up 17%. While adoption agencies do not keep data
on adoptive parents, experts say most of the adoptive parents are
white."More and more white folks are adopting children of color,"
says author Pertman, who is also executive director of the Adoption
Nation Education Initiative. "That is crystal clear."</TE>
<TE>   International adoptions are also increasing. Between 1995 and
2001, the number of immigrant visas issued to orphans coming to the
United States more than doubled, from 8,987 to 19,237. More than half
of these adoptions are from countries where non-Caucasians are the
dominant racial group, while people adopting are overwhelmingly
Caucasian.</TE>
<TE>   Because of these increases, many parents, social workers and
adoption agencies have been forced to move beyond the trans-racial
debate, to try to reconcile same-race family ideals with mixed-race
adoptive family reality.</TE>
<TE>   "Where I am at now is recognizing that trans-racial adoption is
happening," said John Raible, 41, an African American at the Pact
summit.</TE>
<TE>   He was adopted by a white family in the early 1960s and has been
speaking publicly about the issue since he was 17. "There is a
controversy, but I'm not really interested in the controversy
anymore. I'm interested in helping kids in that situation."</TE>
<TE>   Children in trans-racial adoptive families confront issues of race
at an early age, sometimes voiced heartbreakingly at ages as young as
2 or 3. They cry to their parents that they just want everyone to
match. External pressures--and scrutiny--from people of all races
becomes a fact of life. As these children grow up, they want to know
their own cultural history--something their parents may not always be
prepared or able to teach. Children of color--particularly African
Americans--need to learn the tools to navigate racism and
discrimination, experts say, something that their white parents often
have never experienced.</TE>
<TE>   Crumbley, the African American therapist and social worker, spoke
on numerous panels at the summit. He believes placing children with
same-race parents should be a priority, and he believes state
agencies aren't doing enough to recruit minority families to adopt
children out of foster care. Nonetheless, he writes and speaks
extensively to white parents on the topic--including at the Concord
summit--because he sees how critical their role is.</TE>
<TE>"It's real important that people know that love is not enough," said
Crumbley. "There is a tendency to gloss over that. Love should be
enough, but it isn't as long as we are in a race-conscious society.
You are neglecting the child if you don't address race and culture."</TE>
<TE>   How Adopted Child Clashed With Family</TE>
<TE>   Liza Triggs, 31, an African American raised by white parents, said
her biggest struggle took place while she was still at home. Triggs
was adopted at birth and grew up the youngest in a family of four
children. She has a Korean sister, a black, biracial brother and a
white brother. During her elementary school years, the family lived
in a diverse community in a college town in Ohio. Some of her
teachers were black, as were many of her classmates. Race wasn't an
issue. But when Triggs turned 11, the family moved to Marin County.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned really quickly that our family was not the norm and not
readily accepted by society," she said. "It was a big culture shock
and a big reality check. It was the beginning of my long-term
struggle."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Triggs didn't understand her feelings. All she knew
was she didn't fit in, and she had problems with other kids. As an
adolescent, she took matters into her own hands.</TE>
<TE>   Near the bus station where she transferred for school, Triggs
found a community that was predominantly black "but was not the
safest community." She made friends and started hanging out there. A
clash with her parents ensued.</TE>
<TE>   "They had concerns because of safety issues. And I felt they had
concerns because they didn't want me to be with my people. I felt I
had finally found a comfortable place, and they were trying to keep
me away."</TE>
<TE>   Gail Steinberg, Triggs' mother, co-founded Pact and was the
organizer of the recent summit. She also co-wrote "Inside Transracial
Adoption," a book that describes her experiences as a mother in a
multiracial family. She says Triggs took risks in her after-school
exploits that left her "terrified."</TE>
<TE>   "She had many connections who were middle-class African Americans
like herself," Steinberg recalled. "But only the ones on the edge
were interesting to her.</TE>
<TE>   "Forget the racial issue. Every adoptee thinks 'I might be the
Queen of Sheba's daughter, or maybe my mother was a tramp.' Then they
try on all the roles and see which one fits. They were very
stretching times. Thank God they are over."</TE>
<TE>   Triggs' struggle continued until she moved away from home for
college where she could play with her identity and decide for herself
if she wanted to be "as white as I can be or as black as I can be."</TE>
<TE>   Today, she identifies as a black woman.</TE>
<TE>   "That is where my comfort zone is," she said. "My friends are
black. My husband is black. Every friend of mine isn't black, but I
spend more time in the black community."</TE>
<TE>   The perspective of these parents and children who have already
survived the long-term challenges of creating a trans-racial family
forced some attendees to confront realities that are hard to foresee
when you're holding a beautiful baby for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Raible, the African American speaker who grew up in a trans-racial
family in the suburbs of Milwaukee and Boston, said after the
conference that he saw parents at the summit realize for the first
time that "the way you look at America is not the way it really is."</TE>
<TE>   "Parents were walking around almost in a state of bewilderment,"
Raible said. "This was poking a hole in the bubble that a lot of
white people walk around in. It kind of scared them."</TE>
<TE>   But some experts believe there are positive social side effects to
trans-racial adoption. First, it cannot be hidden, helping to break
down the stigma of adoption.</TE>
<TE>   Pertman believes that trans-racial adoption--precisely because it
is so visible--is having a profound effect on how we conceive of
families.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think kids in L.A. grow up thinking kids look just like
Mommy and Daddy? Of course not, because they have a little Chinese
girl in their class who has two white mommies. We are raising a
generation who will not have the same notions of family that we do.
And it's because of this trans-racial stuff."</TE>
<TE>   In big ways and small--from challenging racist comments at
adjacent restaurant tables to trying to introduce new perspectives
into school curriculums--these white parents have the potential to
become a new breed of activist.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the new civil rights movement," said Crumbley. "These
parents are on the cutting edge, whether they know it or not."</TE>
<TE>Adoptive parents are struggling to make the world a fairer place for
their children, he says, just as parents in any minority group have
for generations.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see your child hurt, there is no form of motivation like
that in the world," Crumbley said.</TE>

<HD>Man's Garage Sale Junk Is His Wife's Treasure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOIS ROMANO</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>TULSA, Okla.</DL>
<LD>As garage sales go, it was wildly successful. Hundreds of bargain
hunters showed up over two consecutive Saturdays at the upscale Tulsa
home. Steve Connor happily cleaned out his garage. And he made an
impressive $1,000.</LD>
<LD>   So why is Susan Connor so distraught?</LD>
<LD>   "When I walked into the garage and realized what was gone, I
started moaning and screaming," Susan Connor said. "I was
devastated."</LD>
<TE>   Susan Connor's horror story--which has been very big news in
Tulsa--began in June, when she took her two young children to visit
family in Richmond, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Steve decided to hold what he promoted as an "Unauthorized Garage
Sale" and a "Covert Operation."</TE>
<TE>   Unbeknown to him, the garage contained boxes of household items
that his wife just hadn't unpacked, and countless sentimental
possessions--infant clothes (including first shoes), Madame Alexander
dolls and a framed map of the United States, a memento from her late
grandfather. Sold--all of it.</TE>
<TE>   When she returned this month, Susan embarked on a marketing
campaign. Local television carried stories of her woes, the Tulsa
World published a feature, and she went on the radio. The Connors ran
a $175 newspaper ad two weeks ago--trumpeting "Husband in the
Doghouse"--imploring people to return the items. They offered to pay
$3 for every $1 spent.</TE>
<TE>   Susan did get back the framed map, a chair and the dolls, but no
baby clothes. "I know people think I'm overreacting," she said. As
for Steve, he declined to comment. "He just wants the whole thing to
go away," his wife said.</TE>

<LD>"Stickeen: John Muir and the Brave Little Dog"</LD>
<LD>   by John Muir as retold by Donnell Rubay</LD>
<LD>   This book is about a puppy named Stickeen who goes with John Muir
to the mountains of Alaska. John Muir is an explorer. Stickeen is
brave and always follows John Muir. He and Stickeen are in great
danger but Stickeen never gives up. He always takes a chance.</LD>

<TE>   "The Van Gogh Cafe"</TE>
<TE>   by Cynthia Rylant</TE>
<TE>   The Van Gogh Cafe used to be a movie theater that got old and
broken down. In place of it they put in the Van Gogh Cafe.</TE>
<TE>   The main characters are 10-year-old Clara and her father, Marc,
the cook. Other characters go to the cafe, like a writer, a woman
from the East, a woman from the West, 14 orphan children and a boy
who lost his cat.</TE>
<TE>   The old theater walls have left their magic in the Van Gogh Cafe.
Read the book to see how it affects people's lives. I recommend this
book to anyone who likes mystery and magic. Will there be a sequel?</TE>

<HD>Making Meals and Family Memories</HD>

<LD>The request from my sister-in-law was simple enough: "Can you teach
me to make chicken and dumplings, the way your mother used to make
it?" She wanted to surprise her husband, my brother, with his
favorite childhood dish, a staple of Sunday dinners when we were
kids.</LD>
<LD>   I couldn't recall the last time I'd made it. But chicken and
dumplings ... how hard could that be? Since I had no guide in my
recipe file and none of my cookbook versions sounded quite right, I'd
have to rely on memories.</LD>
<LD>   A whole chicken, boiled until the meat slipped off the bone.
Chopped onions, celery, lots of pepper and salt. I remembered spongy
slabs of biscuit dough that my mother rolled flat and sliced, then
dropped into the simmering pot. But there was so much I couldn't
remember. Does the chicken stay in the pot while the dumplings are
cooking? Are there bay leaves involved? Butter? Garlic? Are the
dumplings supposed to be this sticky?</LD>
<TE>   I narrated as I went through the motions, dictating measurements
and steps with an authority I didn't feel. Jennifer dutifully took it
down, presuming that somehow I know these things, as if I had become
my mother when she passed on and I inherited her mantle as matriarch
of our family.</TE>
<TE>   I realized it wasn't just a meal I was making; it wasn't only
physical hunger they were trying to sate. That pot of imperfect
chicken and dumplings was intended to recapture my mother's spirit,
to satisfy an emotional need and link us to our family's past.</TE>
<TE>   In my mother's family, the cooks never seemed to use cookbooks or
consult written recipes. I always thought it was a product of their
Southern heritage, a youth spent on a farm in poverty, where you had
to cook with whatever was on hand and required ingredients were a
luxury.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I consider it a reflection, as well, of an incongruous
combination of culinary arrogance and humility. "It's simple, but I
can't tell you how to make it," my aunts would say if we asked.
"You'll just have to come in here and watch."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, as kids, we never did. We just ate and enjoyed and
never realized that they wouldn't always be around to cook like this.
We considered the special dishes that each cook toted to family
dinners and cookouts a sort of birthright, an entitlement in our
family.</TE>
<TE>   Aunt Ora's peach cobbler and three-bean salad, Uncle Earl's
spareribs, Aunt Rose's cornbread, Aunt Lottie's macaroni and cheese
.... Just mention their names and my taste buds still flood with
memories.</TE>
<TE>   Now I realize that I may never again taste any of these. My uncle
has passed on and my elderly aunts have moved back down South and
don't cook much anymore. In desperation, I make the rounds by phone,
trying to wring from their memories enough to assemble some recipes.</TE>
<TE>   But their answers are basically the same. And though they leave me
short of what I need to know, they give me food for thought in their
simplicity: It's been so long, I can't remember how I made it, honey.
I didn't use a recipe. I just made it by heart.</TE>
<TE>   By heart, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   It is 100 degrees outside, and inside, our kitchen is sweltering
as steam rises from a simmering vat on the stove, bubbling with the
beginnings of fresh chili.</TE>
<TE>   Chili was one of the few things I let my mother teach me to make.
"It's good for when you have friends come over," I remember her
saying, as we sat side by side at the kitchen table, surrounded by
mounds of chopped celery, peppers and onions and cans of tomatoes and
kidney beans. I realize now, it was my life without her that she was
imagining.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, chili became the item I considered my specialty--the
meal I served in college when friends dropped by, the first meal I
cooked for the man I would marry, the dish my former baby-sitter
still raves about in letters from her home in Sweden. "Please send me
the recipe," she says. "I don't have one," I tell her. "I make it by
heart."</TE>
<TE>   And while it may not be much of a culinary legacy--not like lemon
souffle or chateaubriand--on this night, I'm determined to pass it
down to my daughters. It may be too late for my mother, but there's
still time for me.</TE>
<TE>   But when I gather my girls around the table, their protests undo
my good intentions. "It's too hot in here.... You know I don't eat
meat.... Cutting onions makes my eyes water." I dismiss them in
frustration. They don't realize that this is about more than food.
They cannot conceive of a time when I won't be here to cook, cannot
imagine standing alone before the stove trying futilely to re-create
my recipes.</TE>
<TE>   But the mere request that I make my mother's chicken and dumplings
has left me face-to-face with mortality.</TE>
<TE>   I think of all the things she seemed to make so effortlessly ...
meatloaf, fried chicken, collard greens, biscuits smothered with
turkey a la king. I can still summon those tastes from memory, but
cannot replicate them on my own.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that is as it should be, as it has to be. Because while we
learn to improvise, we must also learn to live without.</TE>
<TE>   Just as I may never again taste the richness of my mother's
chicken and dumplings, the perfect peach cobbler, the creamiest
macaroni and cheese, no written recipes or cooking lessons will save
my daughters from one day cooking alone, by heart.</TE>

<LD>Picture it: a bevy of heart specialists boogieing to Billy Bob
Thornton belting out "Smokin' in Bed." It happened at the American
Heart Assn.'s inaugural "Paint the Town Red" awards gala.</LD>
<LD>   Apologizing in advance, the actor-musician told guests as he stood
onstage with his band at the Beverly Hilton Hotel: "I know there are
a lot of doctors here tonight--but I did write a song about pot. I'm
sorry. It's a tribute to my old buddies who used to lie around and
watch cartoons."</LD>
<LD>   The star's gratis rock-and-blues gig capped a July 27 benefit gala
that was as off-the-wall as it was profitable. Guests, who were also
entertained by mind readers, dancing dragons, acrobats and a woman
balancing fresh eggs on her nose, helped raise more than $200,000 for
the association's research, education and advocacy programs.</LD>
<TE>   Minutes before Thornton's performance, Jeffrey Wigand--the former
executive whose revelations about the tobacco industry resulted in a
$246-billion litigation settlement with the government and inspired
the film "The Insider"--stood on the same stage to receive the
association's Hero of the Year Award.</TE>
<TE>   "So many people paved the pathway for me to accept this
award--lawyers, students, doctors, my own children," Wigand said. "To
them, I owe a debt of gratitude." He urged the 500 guests to remain
vigilant about protecting people from the diseases that "start with a
cigarette and take 430,000 lives each year."</TE>
<TE>   Each day, "3,000 children start to smoke," added Wigand, whose
Smoke-Free Kids foundation seeks to prevent children from becoming
addicted to nicotine. During the cocktail reception, Wigand observed
that the average age today for beginning smokers "is between 11 and
12 years. This is truly a childhood disease," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The gala featured a delectable yet heart-healthy menu--coconut
chicken soup, grilled chicken breast, red-bean mousse and mango
pudding--and a program that also handed out awards for excellence to
Ronald Karlsberg (cardiovascular clinical research), Debra Judelson
(women's cardiovascular education), Hillel Laks (cardiological
surgical advancement), Esai Morales (public education and health
awareness) and Melissa Havard (public health).</TE>
<TE>   "Heart disease is the No. 1 killer in the Western world," said
Robert Roberts, chief of cardiology at Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston, Texas. "We clearly have a lot of work to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drama Alfresco</TE>
<TE>   Theater under the stars was on the bill for spectators attending
the opening-night performance of South Coast Repertory's "California
Scenarios."</TE>
<TE>   The collection of five short plays written by prominent Latino
playwrights is staged in the Isamu Noguchi Sculpture Garden in Costa
Mesa. Featured are works by Luis Alfaro, Joann Farias, Anne
Garcia-Romero, Jose Cruz Gonzalez and Richard Coca.</TE>
<TE>   Introduced last season as part of the South Coast's Hispanic
Playwrights Project, the production directed by Juliette Carrillo
returned with four of its original plays. Coca's "The Hanging of
Josefa" marked its premiere.</TE>
<TE>   The works are performed in areas of the garden inspired by
California's varied landscape: urban, desert, waterway, forest,
meadow.</TE>
<TE>   "The plays represent a melding of the art of the sculptor
[Noguchi] with the art of the playwright," said theater director
Martin Benson.</TE>
<TE>   "They help explain in an artistic way the experience Latinos have
had in the California culture."</TE>
<TE>   Guests, who were handed folding chairs when they arrived, were
invited to move to different areas of the lighted garden as the plays
were performed by a repertory of eight actors. A post-production
reception July 27 provided theatergoers with the opportunity to chat
with the playwrights.</TE>
<TE>   Coca based his play on the "first woman to be hanged in modern
California history," he said. "Josefa was hanged in 1851 because she
killed a miner who insulted her honor in public."</TE>
<TE>   A sixth-generation Californian, Coca said he hopes his play will
provoke audiences to reflect on their prejudices. "This work poses
the question, 'What are my views about race and where do they come
from?' "</TE>
<TE>   "California Scenarios" concludes today with an 8 p.m. performance.

<LD>Once upon a time, when the Earth was very new, there was a Great
Spirit called Raweno, the Everything-Maker. On this special day, he
was very busy making all the animals.</LD>
<LD>   As he was working, Rabbit said to him, "I want nice long legs and
long ears like a deer and sharp fangs and claws like a lion."</LD>
<LD>   Raweno tried very hard to make the animals the way they wanted to
be.</LD>
<TE>   "I will try and give you what you ask for," Raweno said to Rabbit.</TE>
<TE>   In a big tree nearby, Owl sat waiting for his turn with Raweno.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoo, whoo, Raweno," Owl said. "I want a nice long neck like
Swan's, beautiful red feathers like Cardinal's, a long beak like
Egret's, and a nice crown of plumes like Heron's.</TE>
<TE>   "Be quiet!" Raweno said. "Why are you watching me? You know that
no one is allowed to watch me work. Turn around and look in another
direction. Better still, close your eyes." Raweno was very mad.</TE>
<TE>   Owl refused to do what Raweno said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoo, whoo," he replied. "You can't make me stop watching!"</TE>
<TE>   Raweno became very angry at Owl. He grabbed Owl and pulled him
down from the branch. He stuffed his head deep into his body. He
shook him until his eyes grew round with fright, and he pulled at his
ears until they were sticking up at both sides of his head.</TE>
<TE>   "There," Raweno said. "That will teach you. Now you won't be able
to bend your neck to watch things you shouldn't. Now you have big
ears to listen when someone tells you what not to do. Now you have
big eyes--but not to watch me because you'll be awake only at night
and I work only during the day. And, your feathers won't be red like
Cardinal's but gray like this"--and Raweno rubbed Owl all over with
mud--"as punishment for your disobedience."</TE>
<TE>   Poor Owl flew off his branch calling, "Whoo, whoo, whoo." And to
this day, he remains as Raweno made him--with big eyes, a short neck
and ears sticking up. He also has to sleep during the day and can
only come out at night.</TE>

<HD>When the Truths We Hold Self-Evident Turn False</HD>
<DH>Carbs or protein? Stocks or a stash of cash? Conventional
wisdom is in limbo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This report just in: Everything you know is wrong. Sorry to break the
news, but don't feel bad--tomorrow you'll probably believe something
completely different.</LD>
<LD>   Why, only a few weeks ago, it seems, we all knew exactly what was
right and what to think. Only a few weeks ago, we held these truths
to be self-evident: CEOs were civic role models, the safest place for
your kid to play was the frontyard, and only fools and knaves didn't
have their life savings in the stock market.</LD>
<LD>   Pasta and bread were good for you; red meat was bad. Estrogen
replacement therapy was heaven-sent for women of a certain age, and
arthroscopic knee surgery was a miracle cure for scores of arthritis
sufferers.</LD>
<TE>   How'd we know all this? Conventional wisdom, of course--that
venerable stockpile of essential suppositions, eternal verities and
time-tested beliefs that we rely on to muddle through our otherwise
clueless daily lives.</TE>
<TE>   But today we know better. Today we're enlightened. Today we hold
these truths to be self-evident: CEOs are scoundrels. The safest
place for your kids to play is an underground bunker with armed
guards, lest they join the recent wave of child-napping victims. And
only fools and knaves don't have their life savings in bonds and
T-bills.</TE>
<TE>   Today's conventional wisdom also holds that too many carbs can
kill you, but big, juicy steaks may be wonderfully healthful
(according to a recent New York Times Sunday magazine cover story).
Hormone replacement therapy can cause breast cancer, heart attacks,
blood clots and strokes; and arthroscopic surgery may be no more
salutary than a pinprick.</TE>
<TE>   Thank goodness that's settled ... except that it's not. Because in
dazed and confused times, like the present age, there's nothing with
a shorter shelf life than conventional wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost as if the problem with conventional wisdom is that it
really isn't," says E. David Sosa, an associate professor of
philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin. "If it really is
wisdom, then there's no problem with it being conventional. The
problem is when it's not really wisdom."</TE>
<TE>   So what is it then? Call it orthodoxy, truisms, dogma, the
collective superego, urban legends or old wives' tales. By whatever
name, the tribal gods are toppling. Everywhere you look, conventional
wisdom is under siege as the country frets about whether to buy! buy!
buy! or sell! sell! sell!; whether to worry more about global warming
or dirty bombs; and whether to ask the waitress to hold the rice
pilaf or the blue cheese dressing.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, irrational exuberance has given way to irrational
pessimism. On Main Street, there's a feeling that today's "sure
thing" may turn out to be tomorrow's bum steer, that the prevailing
"common sense" could morph overnight into nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   Truisms Are No Longer</TE>
<TE>   If the state of the nation is fundamentally sound, some
commentators wonder, how come we're suddenly acting more like
Argentina than America? Perceptually, at least, the ground beneath us
is shifting, and our universe seems governed by a logic more
Borgesian than Newtonian.</TE>
<TE>   "Truisms in general, I think, are endangered. Maybe that's a
truism too," says humorist Ian Shoales, a.k.a. Merle Kessler, whose
commentaries run on ABC's World News Now and air Sunday mornings on
KCRW (FM 89.9). "There aren't any old wives anymore--all the old
wives are taking Botox."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem with conventional wisdom, Shoales suggests, is
that there's simply too much of it floating around to carry much
authority or credibility. It's rare, he says, to find anyone willing
to admit "I don't know," or "It baffles me." "You don't get that
anymore," Shoales says. "Everyone's got an answer."</TE>
<TE>   Howard Fienberg, senior analyst at the Statistical Assessment
Service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C.,
says the contemporary information overload makes it difficult even to
know what the conventional wisdom is on any subject, let alone
whether it's valid.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting harder to figure out who to trust and what to
trust," says Fienberg. "So you can say, 'Well, I eat a lot of fiber
and too much fiber is bad for me,' and the next day come back and
say, 'Well, I need to eat the fiber for my colon.' "</TE>
<TE>   In times past, conventional wisdom was steady and reliable, even
if it was exclusive. When Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith
coined the term in his influential book "The Affluent Society"
(1958), he used it to designate those ironclad economic principles
and political catechisms passed down from generation to generation
like heirlooms.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble with this type of conventional wisdom, Galbraith
suggested, wasn't necessarily that it was erroneous, but that it had
been around so long that it tended to stifle creative thinking and
concentrate power in the hands of the few. Favoring acceptability and
expediency over logic, conventional wisdom had become a shibboleth
for the elites, who used it to maintain the status quo. Conventional
wisdom was the dogmatic foundation of 20th century capitalism, as
unshakable and impenetrable as Gibraltar.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, some say, today's conventional wisdom suffers from
the opposite curse: It's faddish and fleeting. It makes us not slaves
to tradition but dupes to every passing intellectual fad.</TE>
<TE>   In his book "Untruth--Why the Conventional Wisdom Is (Almost
Always) Wrong" (Random House, 2001), journalist Robert J. Samuelson
argues that conventional wisdom is "increasingly an act of
intellectual or political merchandising." The media's need for market
share, he writes, has led to a "pervasive exaggeration of both
problems and solutions, because that's what grabs attention," a
process that Samuelson calls "untruth." This "common distortion of
reality," he emphasizes, is not "typically the result of deliberate
lies" but of hyperbolic thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Sensationalism Distorts</TE>
<TE>   Heather MacDonald, author of "The Burden of Bad Ideas--How Modern
Intellectuals Misshape Our Society" (Ivan R. Dee, 2000), also blames
faulty conventional wisdom partly on the media's tendency toward
sensationalism and its ability to perpetuate false ideas through
endless repetition and reprinting. As an example, she says, the media
continue to spread the misconception that relations between police
and minority communities are deteriorating, despite what she says is
substantial statistical and anecdotal evidence to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the risks of conventional wisdom is that once it's in
place it makes reporters complacent, and you don't see what's right
in front of your eyes," says MacDonald, a fellow at the conservative
Manhattan Institute in New York.</TE>
<TE>   In an affluent society that affords a large degree of personal
choice, MacDonald continues, people "have a sense that if we do
things right we will have a happy, prosperous life. So there's a
tremendous amount of consumer reporting.</TE>
<TE>   "But there is a way to misread information. I don't think the
message was ever that if you cut out fat you can eat 6,000 calories,
but some people interpreted it that way. There's a lot more
information out there that people can use to improve themselves, but
they don't always seize on the whole picture."</TE>
<TE>   Small wonder that the term "conventional wisdom" has gradually
taken on an even more negative connotation than Galbraith probably
intended. And in today's high-tech, entrepreneurial culture, says
Sosa, there may be an additional bias against ideas that are seen as
representing a herd mentality. "Maybe the idea is, 'Well, only nerds
think that way. We've gotta think 'outside the box,' " he speculates.</TE>
<TE>   Americans, of course, have always been as famous for their
skepticism as their idealism. Wary of economic quackery and political
snake oil, we pride ourselves on our flinty pragmatism, our
resistance to the kind of trendy intellectual placebos that we
imagine are the daily bread of places like Paris.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Americans have a near-religious faith in
progress and the potential for self-improvement, and a corresponding
belief that the present and future are superior to the past. Some say
this bipolar quality can be seen in our flip-flopping notions of
conventional wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   "We tend to oscillate between simply accepting whatever people
tell us or kind of cynically dismissing whatever we hear," says Joel
Best, a professor and chair of sociology and criminal justice at the
University of Delaware in Newark and author of "Damned Lies and
Statistics--Untangling Numbers From the Media, Politicians, and
Activists" (University of California Press, 2001).</TE>
<TE>   Even when conventional wisdom is supposedly grounded in cold, hard
data, like statistics--or, perhaps, especially when it is--we've been
trained to distrust it, Best says. "There's an obvious fondness that
we have for simplicity," he says. "Practically every week we hear
that coffee causes cancer, and then the next week it doesn't. And I
think this leads to a lot of frustration and confusion and suspicion
of numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Looking for Red Flags</TE>
<TE>   So are there any helpful hints for separating "bad" conventional
wisdom from "good"? "Big, round numbers are red flags," Best says. "I
think that announcements of general trends, and particularly
announcements of radical transformations, are red flags. I mean, how
likely is it that the world is radically transformed? If you can't
get information about where the number comes from, that's a red
flag."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Waters, an Encino psychologist, offers another approach.
Rather than listening to the latest pronouncement or prophecy, she
says, we might do better to search our own feelings and seek out
advice from people we know we can trust. "A good way to deal with the
fact that you have internalized conventional wisdom and you're a
product of your society would be to try to make a discrimination when
you're reacting to something: Does it really feel comfortable to you
on a personal level? Is it really coming from your feelings and
judgments, or is it coming from somebody else?"</TE>
<TE>   So the next time some pompous media swami or Nostradamus-wannabe
offers a sage piece of advice--such as this one--be sure to remind
him or her that human history is filled with "unsinkable" assumptions
that keeled over faster than the Titanic.</TE>
<TE>   For example, not so long ago we thought the first hominids climbed
down from the trees a mere 4 million or 5 million years ago. Then
last month, researchers in Chad said they'd found the skull of an
early human ancestor dating back 7 million years. One scientist
described the chimp-like creature's braincase as "incredibly modern."</TE>
<TE>   Now, there's some conventional wisdom to take to the bank: In 7
million years, human beings don't appear that much smarter after all.</TE>

<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a military affairs analyst who
writes regularly for Opinion. E-mail: warkin@igc.org</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In times of war, military planners dream large.</LD>
<LD>   They envision super soldiers, arriving silently by stealth
helicopter, wearing temperature-controlled suits that can repel
chemical and biological agents and make an individual nearly
invisible by suppressing infrared and other telltale signatures,
including body odor.</LD>
<LD>   They envision silent guns and lightweight, blast-intensive
explosives, futuristic arsenals of dazzling lasers and high-power
microwave and acoustic weapons. They envision flying and crawling
robots no larger than packs of cigarettes that can send back images
and data from cave and bunker entrances.</LD>
<TE>   This preview of 21st century warfare is described in a set of 2002
research and development documents under the overall title "U.S.
SOCOM Technology Thrust Areas," published by Special Operations
Command, or SOCOM. The documents, circulated to defense contractors
with clearance to develop military technology, aim to spur research
into areas of particular interest to special operations forces. But
they also serve as a vision of the future.</TE>
<TE>   The Special Operations Command, riding high on its successes in
Afghanistan, is in a good position to state its vision. As the
group's commander, Air Force Gen. Charles R. Holland, told the Senate
Armed Services Committee in March, the group's "highest-priority
principal missions" have become combating terrorism and countering
weapons of mass destruction--goals that Congress has shown itself
willing to fund.</TE>
<TE>   SOCOM has seized the moment. As a letter to contractors
accompanying its technology objectives report notes: "A dramatically
shifting national security environment throughout the world
underscores the need for continuing investment in science and
technology. In spite of budget pressures to the contrary, special
operations forces continue to depend on investment in new
technologies to provide [its] warriors with the advantage their
missions demand."</TE>
<TE>   But caution is in order. Part of the reason the highly motivated
and capable special operations forces are so successful is that they
can conduct their business in secret, with little scrutiny, which
often puts them on the edge of the law. Envisioning the weapons of
the future is just one part of the equation. Before rushing to
fulfill the command's vision, policymakers also need to consider the
ultimate effect of those weapons.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Congress consolidated all U.S. special operations forces
under the newly created Special Operations Command. Today, the
47,000-strong force encompasses such celebrated units as the Army's
Green Berets and Rangers and the Navy SEALS as well as
less-publicized Air Force special tactics units and the super-secret
Delta Force, along with other units overseen by the Joint Special
Operations Command.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike with other military units, Congress provides separate
research, development and acquisition funding directly to SOCOM,
which allows the command--based in Tampa, Fla.--to develop equipment
uniquely suited to its shadowy missions. Its procurement philosophy,
Holland said, is simple: "We select the best and train for
innovation: We are equipping the warrior, not manning the equipment."</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, SOCOM has capitalized on its enhanced prominence,
using its ability to contract outside usual procurement rules to
acquire new technologies that complement its mission. Just before
Operation Enduring Freedom commenced in October, SOCOM reports it was
able, in just seven days, to find, purchase and place in the hands of
spotters in Afghanistan new binocular-like laser devices used to
observe and precisely measure the three-dimensional coordinates of
distant targets like caves. It is the kind of purchase that inspired
Holland to tell the Senate committee that one of the lessons of
Afghanistan is that "seemingly small investments in equipment could
be devastating in the hands of a prepared operator."</TE>
<TE>   But SOCOM is also interested in the not-so-small investments in
equipment. In the words of the documents, special forces "must adapt
or be overcome by the new frontiers of technological change." The
documents predict that genetics, nano-technology and robotics "will
sooner, rather than later," replace nuclear, biological and chemical
technologies. Special operations, it continues, "will have to adapt
to these entities or become irrelevant."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, SOCOM calls on industry to develop innovations that
will allow special forces to "leap ahead in technological change."
These technologies would include robotics, a whole new class of
genetically engineered drugs for performance enhancement and
protection against chemical and biological weapons, greatly enhanced
explosives, "do-everything" sensors and sophisticated information and
intelligence technologies. Crawling, flying and swimming robots are a
particularly high priority because of their ability to get to "places
that are impractical, impossible or too dangerous for the operator,"
the documents say.</TE>
<TE>   The ability of special forces to gain "access to denied areas and
closed systems" is also key to the focus on "information
operations"--that is, cyber and electronic warfare--in its future
developments. Information operations, Holland told the Senate
committee, have "the potential to help operators remain undetected
and unlocated in hostile territory." For SOCOM, this means using
computer hacking techniques to conduct sabotage as well as manipulate
the enemy's information systems. If territory cannot be penetrated
physically, the documents envision virtual operations to place the
U.S. "in" enemy camps. Holland says his group intends "to actively
pursue [such] capabilities and develop standing authority to employ
[them] when needed."</TE>
<TE>   A second element of information operations discussed in the
planning document is "influence operations," including psychological
warfare, counter-propaganda, deception and counter-deception. "The
social sciences can provide a deeper understanding of the factors
that influence human behavior and the dynamics of mass media
interaction with society and the government. To achieve a desired
effect, a psychological weapon may be a better choice than a physical
one," the document says.</TE>
<TE>   But physical weapons also have their place. The document outlines
a commitment to fielding the first generation of "directed energy
weapons"--lasers, microwave, radio-frequency or electromagnetic-pulse
devices where energy, rather than explosives or projectiles, would be
used "to kill, neutralize or suppress enemy or civilian personnel as
well as incapacitate vehicles, ships or aircraft." Versatility too is
stressed: "The weapons of the future must not only be lethal but also
be able to be 'tuned' for nonlethal application of force."</TE>
<TE>   Employing all of this technology, of course, is the super-soldier
himself. These soldiers, SOCOM stresses, need to operate covertly in
austere and extreme environments and even in the presence of nuclear,
biological or chemical weapons. The report urges industry to examine
"all physiological, physical, mental, psychological and intellectual
means to identify and counter the degradation of the [special forces
troops] caused by the demands of sustained operations and extreme
environments." This is where the future vision is most ambitious,
mentioning food, drugs, implants, vaccines and genetic engineering as
areas of research. "The ultimate goal for [special forces] is to be
able to operate in an environment [contaminated by nuclear,
biological or chemical weapons] without any special
equipment/clothing," the document concludes.</TE>
<TE>   What is missing from this vision of future combat is any
acknowledgment that the weapons must also be in accordance with a
1995 American commitment not to develop blinding lasers and with
other U.S. obligations under international law to ensure that our
weapons do not indiscriminately affect civilians or cause
"unnecessary suffering."</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. continues its campaign against Al Qaeda and prepares
for full-scale war with Iraq, special forces and CIA paramilitary
capabilities will be an active covert counterpart to the highly
visible conventional air, ground and naval forces. We know these
forces are capable, but we also need to consider how they accomplish
their goals.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, a country must answer for its tactics--even if it wins
militarily. Secret operations conducted outside the law can come with
a high political cost. Composing a wish list for future weaponry
certainly has its place, but the ultimate goal of military planning
has to be victory both on the battlefield and in the political arena.
We have to hope someone is doing equally meticulous planning on the
political end. Otherwise, our omnipotent fighting force might just
provoke terrorists to find new and exotic ways to harm
Americans--both on and off the battlefield.</TE>

<HD>The Spoiled Brats of Summer</HD>
<DH>To restore baseball's luster, corporate owners and players
need to do more than settle their dispute</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KELLY CANDAELE and PETER DREIER</AU>
<BD>Peter Dreier is professor of politics at Occidental
College. Kelly Candaele is a political consultant.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the last baseball strike, in 1994, President Clinton made a
feeble and unsuccessful attempt to mediate. It's unlikely that
President Bush will make the same mistake. Drawn reluctantly into the
corporate-reform crusade in the wake of the
Enron/WorldCom/Tyco/Arthur Andersen et al scandals, Bush remains a
fan of unregulated markets, and Major League Baseball is the least
regulated of all industries, the only one exempt from the nation's
antitrust laws. If Bush were to intervene, the media might remind the
public how he once used his political connections to buy the Texas
Rangers franchise with a minimal investment, got the city of
Arlington to raise taxes for a new stadium and then made a huge
windfall profit when he and his co-owners sold the team in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   No, baseball's owners and players union will have to settle this
one on their own. But what's going on in U.S. politics and business
these days isn't entirely irrelevant to the situation in baseball.
Major League Baseball, too, has credibility problems.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike other scandal-plagued corporations that inflated profits
through accounting trickery, Major League Baseball teams crunch the
numbers to erase earnings. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, whose
family owns the Milwaukee Brewers, says that only five teams made a
profit last season. But as Roger Abrams, a labor law and sports
professor at Northeastern University, recently observed: "Sports
accounting is to accounting as military music is to music. It's still
accounting, but not quite."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball teams are increasingly owned by corporate conglomerates.
AOL Time Warner Inc. owns the Atlanta Braves, the Tribune Co. the
Chicago Cubs, and Rogers Communications the Toronto Blue Jays. The
Los Angeles Dodgers are a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
Because teams are increasingly owned by corporations, profits can be
discreetly moved from one entity to another to conceal the true
earnings of the baseball end of the business. For example, if a
"separate" corporation is set up to sell concessions or parking
spaces, creative bookkeeping can make it look as if its profits are
not accruing to the team even though the team and the corporation are
owned by the same people. Owners can even pay themselves a
"consulting fee" and report it as a team debt, as New York Yankees
owner George Steinbrenner reportedly has done.</TE>
<TE>   Recent revelations of corporate skulduggery have triggered calls
for more government regulation to protect stockholders, employees
with pensions and consumers. Genuine reform of baseball would require
the revocation of its antitrust exemption, granted in 1922 by the
U.S. Supreme Court, that allows the owners to keep competitors out of
their market, eliminate teams or fix prices. To guard against that
dire threat to their pocketbooks, team owners have hired lobbyists,
set up a political contribution fund and designed a political
strategy to influence the current collective bargaining process.
According to a recent report in the National Journal, Major League
Baseball spent $1.2 million lobbying Washington last year, twice the
amount it paid out in 2000 and double the total the National Football
League, the National Basketball Assn. and the National Hockey League
collectively spent. Most of the political money went to members of
the House and Senate judiciary committees, which have jurisdiction
over baseball's antitrust exemption.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom from federal and state control enables baseball teams to
behave like global corporations. A footloose team may encourage
cities to engage in a bidding war for the "distinction" of being its
new home. To attract the franchise, cities offer to subsidize the
construction of a new stadium or to modernize an existing one, often
under the guise of revitalizing urban downtowns. If this means owners
catering to other corporate executives by building stadiums with
luxury boxes complete with computer terminals, while blue-collar
types have to watch games on television at home, so much the better.</TE>
<TE>   The gentrification of baseball, as Smith College economist Andrew
S. Zimbalist, author of "Baseball and Billions," points out, is good
for the bottom line. "If you're a media conglomerate that is both in
the television business and in the baseball business, you don't mind
at all if you're increasing your television audience while decreasing
your live audience," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike mainstream U.S. business, however, baseball's key
employees--the players--are unionized. Only about 14% of U.S. workers
belong to unions, but 100% of the players do. And since the end of
the reserve clause--the rule that bound a player to a team until the
owner traded or fired him--in 1975, the players have made dramatic
gains in pay, benefits and working conditions. The average yearly
salary is more than $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The looming confrontation between owners and players is thus a
battle between winners. If there is a strike or lockout, baseball's
already tarnished image may be permanently harmed. Some observers
worry it may never recover. After the 1994 baseball strike and the
cancellation of the World Series, many fans were fed up and baseball
attendance nose-dived. Fortunately, the home-run heroics of Mark
McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds, coupled with the growing numbers
of Latinos and Asians on the playing field, have helped fill the
stands again.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball certainly needs to settle its current dispute if it wants
to hold on to its gains. But it if truly wants to rehabilitate its
image and ensure fan loyalty, Selig and the ballplayers need to take
another step: They need to make a gesture of solidarity with the
working stiffs who have provided the sport with its populist base of
support. That would go a long way toward erasing the images of greedy
owners and spoiled athletes.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, players should take time off from paid
autograph-signing sessions to advocate a "living wage" for the
workers at the stadiums where they play--the ushers, food vendors and
parking-lot attendants. Players and owners should also look for the
union label, or at least the non-sweatshop label, on their uniforms,
caps and baseballs. It took a yearlong strike at New Era Cap Co.,
which makes Major League Baseball's caps, to secure a union contract.
New Era, which also produces caps for more than 350 colleges and
universities, was the target of a successful publicity campaign by
the United Students Against Sweatshops. The students' threat to
pressure their colleges to withdraw their contracts with New Era
settled the strike.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, Major League Baseball should draw up a code of
conduct for all companies that do business with it. How many fans,
for example, know that the baseballs that San Francisco Giant Bonds
hits into McCovey Cove are made in Costa Rica, where workers make $50
a week if they work full time? To be sure, in contracting out the
manufacture of the sport's main symbol to a low-wage country, Major
League Baseball is behaving like other U.S. corporations. But it
should make sure that those workers and others who make its uniforms
and paraphernalia sold in stadiums toil in decent working conditions
and are paid reasonably well relative to the countries' wage scales.
A highly public and aggressive campaign geared toward that goal would
certainly help offset the image of millionaire players squabbling
over their next million.</TE>
<TE>   Like U.S. business, Major League Baseball has jeopardized the
confidence and trust of its fans. Can the corporate stewards of
America's "national pastime," along with the players union, many of
whose members seem to have forgotten their humble backgrounds,
recognize that when the nation's sports pages start looking like the
business section, the fans might just tell the owners and players
alike that after three strikes, they're out of business.</TE>

<AU>RICHARD W. FISHER</AU>
<BD>Richard W. Fisher, managing partner of the
international strategic advisory firm Kissinger McLarty Associates,
was deputy U.S. trade representative in the Clinton administration
and helped negotiate the Free Trade Area of the Americas.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>To some people, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill is to modern
financial markets what the Rev. William A. Spooner was to English
syntax in the early 1900s: He has a knack for saying precisely the
wrong thing at the wrong time. Yet sometimes he is right on target.</LD>
<LD>   Three weeks ago, he was urging our new best friends in Central
Asia to continue their support for our war in Afghanistan.
"Security," he said, "depends on a shared stake in the future of the
global economy, ties of trade, investment and enterprise." This week,
O'Neill is scheduled to visit old friends in Argentina, Brazil and
Uruguay. They will want to hear how his and President Bush's vision
of a "shared stake" applies to them. What he says and does will be
closely monitored throughout the hemisphere and in the global markets
because Latin America is in an economic and political meltdown.</LD>
<TE>   Venezuela, the third-largest supplier of oil to the U.S., is
boiling with revolutionary fervor stirred up by a president who
recently turned to Libya's Moammar Kadafi for a loan. Paraguay has
been paralyzed by rioting spurred by growing unemployment and a
powerless leader. Bolivia is flirting with electing an openly
anti-U.S. president who admires Fidel Castro, considers "capitalism
the enemy of humanity" and wants to establish coca growing as a legal
business. Peru's president recently sacked his two most market-savvy
Cabinet officers and is considering backing off free-market reforms.
Uruguay, once the Switzerland of South America, has gone from 5%
annual growth and an investment-grade credit rating to recession and
junk status and is rapidly running out of monetary reserves.
Argentina is reeling with social unrest and has had a revolving-door
presidency now occupied by a leader who has decided he too must exit
before his term is finished. Brazil, sharing borders and economic
ties with all these churning countries, faces an uncertain national
election in October.</TE>
<TE>   Against this backdrop of political turmoil, financial contagion
has begun to raise its ugly head. Latin currencies are sinking almost
as rapidly as the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq. The
Argentine peso is down 73% since the start of the year. The
Venezuelan bolivar is off 43%, the Uruguayan peso 38% and the
Brazilian real 30%. All this against a declining dollar. The
purchasing power of Latin Americans and the ability of newly
privatized Latin companies and governments to create jobs have
imploded.</TE>
<TE>   In this vortex of chaos, O'Neill must talk straight. There is no
room for even the most innocent malapropism. He can begin with
reinforcing the point that Argentina and Brazil are separate
countries. This sounds elementary, but it is an important distinction
when Brazil's political and economic challenges are being broadly,
and inaccurately, portrayed as Argentina II. Brazil has serious
economic problems, but it has not reached Argentina's dysfunctional
state. And we cannot afford to let it go there.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina is suffering from what has been called "the slowest
train wreck in history." It routinely deferred tough choices until
the country now finds itself with only the shell of a functioning
economy. This creates an opportunity for O'Neill. He should make
clear to President Eduardo Duhalde, to the brave souls who aspire to
replace him early next year and to rank-and-file Argentines that the
solution to their economic predicament is in their hands: Put serious
and committed managers in the Casa Rosada and the governors'
mansions; enforce the rule of law; protect investors; and get the
nation's financial house in order by unfreezing the banking system;
establish an independent central bank; and, tempting though it may
be, resisting the impulse to use its remaining foreign monetary
reserves to buy out disgruntled bank depositors.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill should also promise that the U.S. will lend financial and
other support once substantive changes are made. The four
international bankers from Europe and Canada now brokering between
Argentina and the International Monetary Fund have the credibility to
demand reforms and the power to be helpful. O'Neill should let them
do their work without commentary.</TE>
<TE>   In Brazil, a country O'Neill knows well from his days in the
aluminum business, he has a very different task. He must acknowledge
that Brazil is the watershed country of the region. Representing 41%
of the economic output of the Americas south of Mexico and 21% of the
population, Brazil is of continental proportions, economically,
politically and symbolically. If Brazil turns its back on the
economic, financial and political reforms begun by the administration
of outgoing President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, it will become
indistinguishable from the rest of struggling Latin America. Should
Brazil sink, President Bush can kiss goodbye his goal of using the
negotiating authority he so artfully secured from Congress to
complete a Free Trade Area of the Americas.</TE>
<TE>   Were Brazil to withstand the tide, however, it could serve as an
anchor for drifting Latin economies, saving the day for
market-friendly economic organization backed by the rule of law and
expanded trade. In the heat of a national election, it is too much to
expect any Brazilian presidential aspirant running against the
incumbent party to publicly declare he will support whatever
solutions the outgoing government negotiates with the IMF and other
creditors to stem the slide of the nation's currency and economy. The
two most prominent opposition candidates, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva
of the leftist Workers Party and Ciro Gomes, who leads a coalition of
center-left and right parties, have more to gain politically from
railing against the economy's current pathology than from supporting
preelection solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Under such circumstances, O'Neill should deliver a simple,
straightforward message to Brazilians: The Bush administration will
work with whoever wins the presidency and is eager to do so. He must
refrain from even the slightest hint that the U.S. has taken sides in
the upcoming election and, instead, proclaim loudly and clearly that
whatever issues divide us at the moment, the U.S. believes our
security rests on working with Brazil and its neighbors to achieve a
shared prosperity. And that shared prosperity will only flow from
policies jointly developed by the "bookends" of the hemisphere, the
U.S. and Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, O'Neill said that "I'm constantly amazed that anybody
cares what I do." If he thought his words and deeds were watched
before, wait until he experiences Latin America and the region's
hunger for U.S. understanding, attention and support. He ain't seen
nothing yet.</TE>

<HD>We Need a Modern Thomas Paine</HD>
<DH>One U.S. institution after another is losing its legitimacy
among the people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. WILLIAM GIBSON</AU>
<BD>J. William Gibson is a professor of sociology at Cal
State Long Beach and author of "Warrior Dreams: Violence and Manhood
in Post-Vietnam America."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The real test of a social science is whether it helps us make sense
of our world in times of dramatic political and economic change.
Sociology offers one such concept: the "legitimation crisis." Briefly
put, leaders of major institutions--economic, political, social,
religious, etc.--need the consent of those they manage. They must
show themselves morally fit to rule. When it becomes evident that
these leaders have betrayed fundamental values, broken laws or
behaved incompetently, a legitimation crisis is created.</LD>
<LD>   The nation is now suffering through such a crisis.</LD>
<LD>   High-level corporate managers have artificially inflated profits
by keeping funny books. As a result, some of their companies are
failing. No one knows how many more workers will lose their jobs, or
how many more thousands of people will watch their retirement funds
shrink. Because the corporate world has lost credibility, the stock
market has been steadily declining; trillions of dollars in personal
wealth have vanished.</LD>
<TE>   While the Democrats desperately want to blame Republicans for the
crisis in corporate governance, they share responsibility. Democracy
21, a group advocating campaign finance reform, reports that over the
last 10 years, corporations gave $636 million to Republicans and $449
million to Democrats. That money helped buy big business political
protection from governmental regulation and undoubtedly emboldened
corporate executives into thinking that they could get away with just
about anything.</TE>
<TE>   The public has lost faith in other U.S. institutions as well.</TE>
<TE>   Bureaucratic rivalry within the nation's intelligence apparatus
may have prevented the government from heading off the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The military's war against terrorism in Afghanistan isn't going as
well as it first appeared.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. mode of warfare threatens both the precarious Afghan
regime and the legitimacy of the war. Hundreds of civilians have been
killed in U.S. bombing raids, and two members of Afghan Prime
Minister Hamid Karzai's Cabinet have been assassinated as old ethnic
tensions and warlord rivalries have resurfaced.</TE>
<TE>   When economic and political leaders fail, it's natural to look to
civil society--churches, schools, universities and foundations--for
moral leadership. But that doesn't offer much of an option either.
The American Catholic Church has been disgraced by revelations of
priestly pedophilia. University presidents are too engaged in
boosterism and fund-raising to risk saying anything that might offend
a potential donor. The public school system, a key element of U.S.
democracy and a source of pride for the country, fails to educate too
many of our children.</TE>
<TE>   Legitimation crises are not new in America. The country went
through one during the 1972-74 Watergate scandal, when Nixon
administration officials illegally raised campaign money, drew up
enemies lists and spied on the radical antiwar and civil rights
movements, and even mainstream Democrats. But two years of
investigation by the news media and a U.S. Senate select committee
revealed the abuses, and in August 1974 the House Judiciary Committee
voted articles of impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon,
leading to his resignation. One part of the U.S. democratic system
stopped the corruption and abuse of power of another, and the crisis
was resolved.</TE>
<TE>   The current legitimation crisis is different because almost the
entire institutional order is affected. As odd as it sounds, the
decline of feudalism in the 17th and 18th centuries offers a
historical analogy. For centuries, the feudal elite, made up of royal
families interconnected with landowning nobility and the upper
echelon of the Catholic Church, controlled the lives of peasants in
the countryside and the merchant and artisan classes in the cities.
But the intellectuals of the Enlightenment and the rising middle and
working classes in the cities saw themselves as the vanguard of a new
society. They criticized traditional feudal authority and advocated
the separation of church and state, democracy, rights of free speech
and assembly, and a market economy. Over time, these thinkers and
doers undermined the legitimacy of feudalism. The American and French
revolutions finished the job.</TE>
<TE>   This sketch of the decline of feudal legitimacy brings into focus
what the present legitimation crisis lacks--an organized opposition.
Reporters interview workers and managers who've lost their jobs or
lost their retirement funds, but, so far, their individual anger
hasn't been channeled into a collective demand for dramatic change.</TE>
<TE>   Feudalism's legitimation crisis was in part sparked by alternative
visions of the good society. Even in colonial America, which did not
suffer the worst of feudal abuses, critics such as Thomas Paine
commanded attention as the public pondered what kind of society it
wanted to be. His "Rights of Man" sold more than 250,000 copies in
its first year.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a serious political treatise becoming a bestseller and the
talk of the country seems almost impossible, in part because the
advocacy of major social and political change is risky. Twenty years
of conservative critiques have taken their toll. Concern about the
common good, as opposed to the sanctity of the private market, has
been nearly discredited. To be called a liberal is to be deemed
mushy, naive and ignorant; to be called a radical is even worse.
Nevertheless, the only long-term solution to the legitimation crisis
is radical--an organized opposition movement to make elites more
accountable, and a renewed discussion of the public good.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, such business reforms as increasing the prison terms of
criminally convicted executives seems the most likely outcome. But
the reforms signed by President Bush last week don't go far enough.
For example, legislation requiring corporations to treat stock
options as a business expense didn't pass. Nor has anything been done
to help the victims of corporate fraud recover their losses. Such
shady business practices as reincorporating headquarters overseas to
avoid taxes remain legal.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, the political system's failure to go beyond halfway
measures may make the legitimation crisis worse. It's not hard to
imagine the widespread withdrawal of people's loyalties to society's
mainstream institutions. Our voting rates, already the lowest among
the advanced capitalist countries, will continue to decline, so
elites will feel even less pressure from below.</TE>
<TE>   And as governments form that are voted into power by an
ever-smaller fraction of the populace, fewer people will feel those
administrations and the policies they pursue to be legitimate. It's a
grim scenario. Under such circumstances, no democracy can endure.</TE>

<AU>JOEL KOTKIN and SUSANNE TRIMBATH</AU>
<BD>Joel Kotkin, a contributing editor to Opinion, is
author of "The New Geography: How the Digital Revolution Is Reshaping
the American Landscape." He is a senior fellow at the Davenport
Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University and the Milken
Institute. Susanne Trimbath, an expert on capital markets, is a
senior research economist at the Milken Institute.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 1970s are back--but that's not entirely bad news. Then, as now,
stocks steeply declined. In 1973-74 alone, the New York Stock
Exchange composite fell by 44%. Equities did not recover until the
early 1980s. Yet the stock market's prolonged stagnation in the 1970s
did not signify the end of prosperity. Rather, the nation's
capitalist engine was undergoing a critical, albeit painful,
recalibration. Something similar is going on today. Call it the
emergence of the "post-nomadic" economy. Security concerns will
replace speculation, real assets will triumph over paper ones, and
more spiritual values will displace materialism.</LD>
<TE>   The post-nomadic trend reflects changes that were building up
before the stock market's current turbulence and Sept. 11. As
Americans have aged and become ever more capable of settling where
they wish, because of the rise of digital technology and the
dispersal of economic activity, fewer of them than ever are willing
to pick everything up and move in pursuit of quick riches. Fewer than
15% of Americans change addresses in any given year, down from a high
of 20% in the 1970s. Contrary to popular reporting, most baby
boomers, suggests demographer William H. Frey, "age in place." That
is, they stay where they are. This development suggests that
residential property may be the "gold" of the emerging economy
because the home has become more important to people financially.</TE>
<TE>   But post-nomadism is also about values that place greater emphasis
on family, faith and community. At the height of the 1990s stock
boom, according to the Zogby International poll, only one in three
Americans defined their "American dream" in spiritual, as opposed to
purely material, terms. By 2000, a spiritual definition was embraced
by 42% of Americans. After Sept. 11, the percentage grew to 52% of
adults.</TE>
<TE>   In the post-nomadic economy, the activities of local businesses
and entrepreneurs will be more important than the global machinations
of speculative capital. The new generators of wealth will be closer
to hearth and home: investments in private businesses, houses, real
estate and the production of goods that satisfy the essential needs
of individuals and families. Industries connected to the post-nomadic
economy--health products, appliances, construction, mortgage banking
and furnishings--stand to thrive in the new times; all expect to
boost payrolls over the next six months. Also benefiting will be the
commercial banks, which service the privately held companies that
account for nearly 60% of U.S. employment, 78% of all new jobs and
more than half of the gross domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   Even among larger companies, the winners will be those that
provide basic products and services. Johnson &amp; Johnson, the
health-care company that has a history of respect for customers, is
one such example. Also likely to do well are companies connected to
what may be considered the most essential service of all--security
and defense.</TE>
<TE>   The changes in values, both economic and social, will affect the
economic landscape. Urban residents, according to Frey, have shown a
markedly higher rate of concern over security issues after Sept. 11
than those living in suburbia and the countryside. These attitudes
will affect where people and businesses locate, and how people spend
or invest their money. For example, real estate agents report a
sizable increase in inquiries about suburban New Jersey and
Westchester, N.Y., from Manhattanites looking to move outside the
"30-mile blast zone."</TE>
<TE>   To see how this post-nomadic economy will play out, it is helpful
to look back to the 1970s. Then, the nation's economy seemed highly
vulnerable, pinched on the one side by Japanese competition and, on
the other, by dependence on Middle East oil. Like today, corporate
scandals were undermining confidence in Wall Street. There was even
widespread criticism of the accounting profession, which was accused
of financial shenanigans to justify the wild ambitions of
irresponsible corporate managers. Then, as now, the whole market
suffered for the indiscretions of a few. As Forbes magazine noted in
1973: "When the paddy wagon backs up to the door, it takes the good
girls, too."</TE>
<TE>   Yet in retrospect, the troubled 1970s laid the foundation for the
next two decades of prosperity. Some U.S. companies disappeared, but
others, awakened from their long managerial slumber, cleaned up their
accounting, restructured and entered the 1980s with enhanced
competitiveness. The 1970s also altered, permanently, the balance of
power among the country's regions. More than a century of Midwestern
and Northeastern economic supremacy ended as the old blueblood,
hierarchical Fortune 500 companies fell before the more
entrepreneurial, flexible and individualistic economies of the
Sunbelt.</TE>
<TE>   History never runs in exact parallels, to be sure. Today's
economic conditions are certainly better than those in 1973.
Inflation is low. More U.S. companies have retained their competitive
edge, and most growth indicators appear to be at least mildly on the
upswing.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, as in the 1970s, the current market turmoil may presage a
major reshuffling of both the industrial landscape and the regional
economic balance of power.</TE>
<TE>   "When people depend on debt to finance operations, they look at
things differently than when it's equity," says Andrew Segal, a
Houston-based real estate investor with holdings in several heartland
cities. "Business now has to look for a more reasonable place. The
ugly ducklings are beginning to look better."</TE>
<TE>   Among the ugly ducklings that may be poised for a reversal of
fortune in a post-nomadic economy are large exporters in the Midwest.
A falling dollar and a greater emphasis on cost controls will benefit
these companies. Metropolises like St. Louis, Baltimore, Cincinnati
and Indianapolis may become more attractive than the pricier coastal
regions for employers seeking to cut expenses in tough times. Recent
economic data on job growth and commercial vacancy rates suggest
these areas are holding up better than those that participated in the
1990s boom (such as Dallas and Denver).</TE>
<TE>   The news is particularly dreary for some of the most celebrated
glitter children of the previous decade.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid- to late-1990s, says Leslie Parks, former economic
development director for San Jose, inflated stock prices created a
false economy that drove up real estate prices and the cost of
managerial and technical talent while driving out more middle-class,
blue-collar activities from the Silicon Valley and its urban
appendage, San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Economic diversity is a constant challenge here," Parks adds. "A
lot of people did not want basic industries. They thought high-tech
could solve everything."</TE>
<TE>   An example of the post-nomadic economy lies just across the Bay in
suburban Contra Costa County. The county is home to sugar factories,
oil refineries, a major military base and health-care providers like
Kaiser Permanente and boasts the headquarters of grocery giant
Safeway. With much of its economic expansion based on serving its
rising population, the area is expected to surpass all others in the
region in job growth over the next two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Most ironic of all, the place that Parks and others in the San
Jose area now see as a model is Southern California, which many in
the Bay Area regard with something between disdain and loathing.
Southern California benefited relatively little from either the 1990s
high-tech or stock-market booms. In part that's because the Southland
economy is chiefly driven by smaller companies, the self-employed and
immigrants, none of whose net worth tends to be expressed in stocks.
Latino households, for example, are barely one-third as likely to
hold mutual funds as Anglos. Instead, their capital fuels a rapidly
growing segment of the regional housing and consumer markets.</TE>
<TE>   Although not a guarantee of long-term success, the Southland
economy has many qualities that will give it an edge in the coming
era. Its industries, besides entertainment, tend to be basic--trade,
garment, textile, furniture, construction--and not vulnerable to wide
speculative swings. Population growth is solid and steady, providing
reliable local markets for basic goods and services, as well as the
real-estate market. And the still potent defense industry seems
poised for further expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The shift to a post-nomadic economy will prove painful for many
people--including Southern California--across the country,
particularly for those who relied most on the speculative boom of the
1990s. But, as in the 1970s, the shift to less-speculative financial
instruments, a renewed emphasis on grass-roots entrepreneurial
efforts and a more rational redirection of human capital will help
the economy, even in the most hard-hit regions, to find surer
footing, setting the stage once again for a new--it is hoped
less-deflatable--boom later in this decade.</TE>

<DH>Middle-class Americans are disinclined to send crooked CEOs
and bankers to real prisons to do hard time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE LOYA</AU>
<BD>Joe Loya is an associate editor at Pacific News
Service. His memoir "The Parole of Buddha Lobo" will be out next
year.</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The last time I saw Charles H. Keating, he was naked except for a
skimpy white towel that hung from his waist. His pink flesh stretched
tight over his gaunt frame, and his wrists were cuffed in front as he
was escorted back from the showers at the Metropolitan Detention
Center in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Several men pounded on their cell doors as the former savings and
loan magnate passed. They whistled at him or hummed strip-dance
melodies, begging him to give us a show. He held himself erect,
staring straight ahead. Before his arrest on fraud, conspiracy and
racketeering charges, his money had protected him behind walls and
gates from desperate men like us. Now his smile was frozen. He had
big teeth and pink gums and looked acutely nervous. But he also
seemed curiously arrogant. And why not? His high-stakes crimes made
my bank robberies seem like petty theft.</LD>
<TE>   Guys like Keating and Ivan F. Boesky and Michael Milken rarely
ended up in the prisons where guys like me did our time. They were
housed at "Club Feds," fenceless facilities where crooked senators,
Wall Street hucksters and bad law enforcement officials live in
dorms, protected from violent prisoners who would resent their
privilege. But Keating was at Metropolitan for a time in 1992 because
he was still fighting his case in federal court here. His lawyers
were arguing that he should be released on bail, that conditions in
the prison put him "in danger of serious, serious deterioration of
his health." We didn't know that then. If we had, we probably would
have made his life even more miserable.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after Keating's shower parade, I was sent to the
federal penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa., and our paths never crossed
again. Today, when I tell the Keating story to friends, they feel
sympathy for him. And this, I think, is telling.</TE>
<TE>   Middle-class Americans have traditionally been disinclined to send
crooked CEOs and bank executives to real prisons to do hard time.
Now, in the wake of Enron and WorldCom and Adelphia, people say
things will be different. Even President Bush is crying for blood:
"No more easy money for corporate criminals," he railed recently from
the White House. "Just hard time."</TE>
<TE>   I, for one, have doubts about whether it will happen, whether
middle-class Americans can disassociate themselves from the ambition
of the wealthy long enough to crack down on them or give them stiff
prison sentences.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Boesky, the infamous Wall Street arbitrageur, pleaded
guilty to a single count of securities fraud--despite admitting he
earned an estimated $100 million by using insider information. In
1990, Milken pleaded guilty to securities fraud and related charges.
He was fined more than $1 billion and sentenced to prison for 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Boesky was allowed to keep secret foreign bank and
brokerage accounts. He served two years in prison and paid $100
million to settle federal civil charges. Milken, who reportedly
earned $1.8 billion with Drexel Burnham Lambert during his criminal
heyday, served only 22 months. He was permitted to keep at least $125
million. His brother, wife and children were also allowed to keep
$300 million to $400 million. He is now a revered Los Angeles
philanthropist. Keating spent nearly five years in prison in Arizona
on federal fraud charges, some of which were later thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   Middle-class Americans say they want to see greedy, dishonest CEOs
punished. But in truth, middle-class Americans are more afraid of
boys from the housing projects holding them up in an alley for 20
bucks than they are of Wall Street scoundrels gutting their pensions
and portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   Boesky, Milken and Keating collectively swindled Wall Street out
of more than $500 million. Yet the three of them together served less
than 10 years. I know a man serving 20 years for an $800 heist.</TE>
<TE>   Why? I think it is because the middle-class jurors and judges see
something of themselves in the fallen rich. The fallen poor are
something else entirely. Is it really so bad, after all, to leave the
slums of Houston for Lewisburg Penitentiary? The fall from River Oaks
to Lewisburg, on the other hand, seems unthinkable.</TE>
<TE>   Men like Keating and Milken and former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay
reflect the deepest dream of the middle-class--wealth. Average
Americans would emulate them if they could. Main Street finds Wall
Street highly seductive.</TE>
<TE>   The average prisoner understands this instinctively, which is why
the men at the Metropolitan Detention Center delighted in
intimidating Keating. But there, he was well protected in a
high-security ward. It would have been harder on him if he had ended
up in a prison like Lewisburg, with prisoners who have been told most
of their lives by TV programs like "Cops" and "America's Most Wanted"
that they are the "real" criminals.</TE>
<TE>   The moral panic about corporate America will subside. The average
American will finally notice that the CEOs don't resemble the drug
pushers, child abductors or terrorists on the nightly news. And just
that quickly, CEOs will be fined nominally, given a year or two in
Club Fed and allowed to keep their fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   And some of them may even become famous philanthropists one day.</TE>

<CX>   Michael Milken--In an article on white-collar crime ("Keating and
Me," Aug. 4), the amount that Michael Milken was fined after pleading
guilty to securities fraud was misstated due to an editing error. He
was fined $200 million in connection with that case. He paid
additional sums to a settlement fund administered by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and to settle civil lawsuits.</CX>

<BD>Gloria Ohland works for the nonprofit Great American
Station Foundation, which promotes community revitalization around
rail stations, and is co-editing a book on transit-oriented
development for Island Press.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was no surprise in June when the Texas Transportation Institute
ranked Los Angeles as the most congested U.S. city: It was our 15th
consecutive year of capturing the dubious honor. This year even the
road-building lobby couldn't muster much optimism about the gridlock:
"I wish I could say there are fixes ... but I don't foresee that,"
Larry Fisher of the Transportation California told a Los Angeles
Times reporter.</LD>
<LD>   There is a fix, although it's no overnight solution. We've focused
attention in recent years on improving public transit, which is
certainly part of the equation. But the other part--still new to
sprawling Los Angeles--is transit-oriented development. In a city
that's been designed and zoned to accommodate travel by car, it isn't
enough to simply build public transit--you have to make it convenient
by building up the city around it.</LD>
<LD>   The concept is a big deal in a lot of cities. In the San Francisco
Bay Area, mixed-use developments that put jobs close to housing and
shopping are now viewed as the best way to address an array of civic
problems, from conserving farmland and open space to shortening
commutes (and the traffic congestion and pollution that accompany
them) and revitalizing low-income neighborhoods.</LD>
<TE>   A Bay Area Rapid Transit spokesman estimates that 40 to 50 such
mixed-use developments have been built or are under construction
along the region's six rail systems in the last few years, with
double that number planned--and that doesn't include the myriad other
developments that have sprung up within a short walk of transit.
Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown's 10K Housing Initiative seeks to locate
6,000 new housing units downtown near jobs and transit, and suburban
San Jose has zoned for and zealously promoted higher-density,
mixed-use development around its rail system.</TE>
<TE>   Outside Washington in Arlington, Va., where for 25 years county
government has planned and zoned for development along the Metrorail
system, the results are impressive. Once an area of low-density
commercial development and declining retail sales, the county now has
a vital corridor of housing and retail along transit lines. Property
values have increased by 81% along the corridor in the last 10 years,
and though the area is just 7.7% of county land, it provides more
than 33% of real estate taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Results like these are prompting other decentralized,
auto-oriented cities--Atlanta, Denver, San Diego, even Dallas--to
reinvent themselves. Both Atlanta and Dallas boast of having
attracted $1 billion in private investment around their rail
stations--even though the rail system in Dallas is only 6 years old
and only 20 miles long. In Denver and San Diego, transit-adjacent
neighborhoods that agree to accommodate population growth in
higher-density developments around rail stations are rewarded with
significant public investment in transit, street landscaping, parks
and other improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The good news for Los Angeles is that the man credited with
popularizing rail and transit-oriented development in San Diego and
Dallas is Roger Snoble, who last year was hired to head L.A.'s
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Some predict L.A. will be his
Waterloo. Others say he comes here at what may be a turning point for
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   That's because the Gold Line from L.A. to Pasadena opens next
year, and it is likely to attract major investment to the area. Two
high-profile projects have already been designed by Pasadena
architects Stefanos Polyzoides and Elizabeth Moule. The two of them,
along with others, co-founded the Congress for the New Urbanism, a
national organization of forward-thinking architects who reinvented
the concept of transit-oriented development to address problems
caused by ever-expanding suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Their Del Mar station project of luxury condos, apartments, stores
and offices is under construction along the rail line two blocks
south of Old Town Pasadena. If successful, the venture is likely to
alert investors and developers to the money-making potential of such
development. Another Moule and Polyzoides transit-adjacent project of
high-density, but beautiful, Craftsman-style apartments, lofts and
retail stores around a series of courtyards is breaking ground in
South Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   A third project, the Holly Street Village housing and retail
complex two blocks north of Old Town, was built on faith--on top of
what would be a rail station when and if the line got built. Now that
the Gold Line is a certainty--and the station is being built--this
pedestrian-oriented development is likely to become premium real
estate. The concept hasn't caught on as quickly in Los Angeles. Its
one completed transit-oriented development, the Hollywood &amp; Highland
project, is disappointing. A glorified shopping mall with too many
parking spaces plopped on top of a rail station, it wasn't designed
to do what such developments can do: ameliorate traffic by putting
housing together with jobs, shopping and entertainment to create
synergy among the various uses.</TE>
<TE>   The best projects are carefully integrated into the neighborhoods
around them, improving life for residents by providing an array of
shopping, transportation and housing choices, including both
affordable and market-rate apartments, condos, lofts and live-work
spaces. It's back to the future, really, building neighborhoods the
way we used to build them, with apartments on top of stores, next to
the movie theater and the grocery store, all in a pleasant walking
environment that's safe and friendly, convenient to transit and
surrounded by lower-density, single-family, residential
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   There is hope that Los Angeles is beginning to attract more
transit-oriented development. The same developers building the Del
Mar station project--Urban Partners, which consists of Nick
Patsaouras, a former MTA board member, Dan Rosenfield, a former city
of Los Angeles real estate assets manager, and Ira Yellin, who
restored the historic Bradbury Building and downtown's Grand Central
Market--are also building an intriguing project at the Wilshire
Boulevard and Vermont Avenue subway station. It will include
market-rate and affordable housing, stores and a Los Angeles Unified
School District middle school.</TE>
<TE>   The inclusion of affordable housing is of paramount importance.
Housing production--especially of affordable and multifamily
units--has fallen dangerously far behind demand in Southern
California. Building of such housing along transit lines is ideal,
since residents wouldn't have to own cars and rents wouldn't have to
include the cost of parking, which can add as much as $30,000 a
parking spot to the cost of construction.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen other transit-oriented projects are in the
planning stages, at Hollywood and Vine, in L.A.'s Chinatown, in Sierra
Madre and at Metrolink stations in Riverside and Fullerton. Several
projects have been proposed for an excellent site at the North
Hollywood subway station, which will also serve the east-west busway,
but none have been selected.</TE>
<TE>   It has taken too long for transit-oriented development to happen
in Los Angeles, but there were reasons for the lag. Rail lines here
opened in the '90s, not exactly a boom time for the real estate
industry in Southern California. The Blue Line to Long Beach was
built along an existing right of way, making it a quick and easy way
to inaugurate L.A.'s rail system. But the line runs through mostly
industrial neighborhoods where few people live or work and that
aren't attractive to investors. The Green Line runs down the middle
of the Century Freeway, making transit-oriented development along its
route almost impossible. And the first stations to open along the Red
Line (the subway) were in already heavily built-up downtown Los
Angeles, and then in less affluent neighborhoods like MacArthur Park
and along Vermont that were unattractive to investors.</TE>
<TE>   It's important for the region to catch up. Current trends suggest
that the equivalent of another city the size of Los Angeles will be
built inside L.A. County over the next 20 years. New residents can
move into huge new housing developments proposed for the Santa
Clarita and Antelope Valleys or out into Riverside and San Bernardino
counties. But imagine what effect further sprawl would have on
traffic and air quality.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. can continue to grow out. Or L.A. can grow up in
transit-oriented developments around the more than the 100 rail
stations in the county. Once residents get a sense of how a
well-designed project can simultaneously increase density and make
neighborhoods more attractive, the advantages of growing up--until
now anathema in Los Angeles--will become obvious.</TE>

<AU>STEVEN L. SPIEGEL</AU>
<BD>Steven L. Spiegel is associate director of the Burkle
Center for International Relations and professor of political science
at UCLA.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you want a glimpse of the gulf that separates Israelis and
Palestinians these days, consider the two groups' differing
perceptions of Israel's bombing of Hamas leader Salah Shehada last
month.</LD>
<LD>   Shehada, along with 14 innocent bystanders, nine of them children,
was killed and his residence leveled when the Israelis dropped a
one-ton bomb from an F-16 fighter jet. For many Israelis and their
supporters worldwide, the bombing was a legitimate response to the
ongoing wave of suicide bombings.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians, along with many critics of Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon in Israel and elsewhere, saw the attack as a deliberate
attempt to torpedo the Palestinian cease-fire. They asserted that the
Gaza strike offered more evidence that Sharon is opposed to peace and
will subvert any move that could lead to a demand for Israeli
concessions.</LD>
<TE>   One sad irony of the current impasse is a report that, 90 minutes
before the attack, members of the Tanzim militant organization, an
offshoot of Fatah with connections to suicide bombings inside Israel,
agreed to announce a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Of course many Israelis believe that the cease-fire report was yet
another case of Palestinian trickery--or, at best, well-meaning talk
by powerless and irrelevant figures. But regardless of perception,
many ask why Israel did not take this latest initiative seriously
enough to at least pause before carrying out the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon insists that Shehada had a history of ignoring Palestinian
calls for cessation of attacks on civilians and that at the time of
his death he was actively preparing major attacks against Israeli
civilian targets. And the prime minister did not order this strike on
his own; Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres, both of the left-wing opposition Labor Party, gave full
support to the operation.</TE>
<TE>   The simple truth here is that after two years of violence, an
unprecedented 12 months of constant suicide bombings and a daily
stream of foiled terror attacks that do not make headlines, the
Israelis no longer trust talk of a cease-fire. Nor do Palestinians
see much cause to trust that things will get better.</TE>
<TE>   All of which raises an important question: Could U.S. diplomacy
have changed the course of events leading up to the Shehada bombing?
While it's hard to be sure, the details of that incident expose a
dangerous vacuum of communication, one that might well be filled by a
hands-on American team in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of trust is not limited to relations between the Israelis and
Palestinians. A European Union representative had briefed the Israeli
government on the cease-fire talks before the strike. But the EU,
which in recent months has swung its sympathies solidly behind the
Palestinians, has little credibility in Israel. (One recent poll
asking whom the Israelis would accept as participants in a possible
international mediation force found the French ranking lower than the
Egyptians, Jordanians and Saudis.) There is no question that Israeli
leaders would have looked differently at the Palestinian negotiations
had they been briefed by an American rather than a European.</TE>
<TE>   Since President Bush called for a change in the Palestinian
leadership in late June, the United States has stepped back from
involvement in day-to-day negotiations on the ground. We are
ostensibly waiting until the Palestinians restructure their
institutions and hold new elections, but it's hard to say how
elections would change anything, as the winner would most likely be
Yasser Arafat. In the absence of U.S. engagement, any promising
openings are left to the mediation of the EU or the United Nations,
both of which are currently unable to effectively communicate with
the Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   The result is the sort of diplomatic chaos that lends itself to
disasters like the Gaza bombing and allows potential opportunities to
be destroyed before they're given a chance. While it's not certain
that a strong American presence could have changed the course of
events, it might have made a real difference.</TE>
<TE>   One idea would be to have a permanent, American-led, multilateral
delegation on the ground, which would consist of representatives of
the new "quartet" (the United States, the European Union, the United
Nations and Russia) as well as other countries like Japan, Canada or
Australia--possibly even Egypt and Jordan--contributing to
Palestinian welfare. They would form a team that would coordinate the
various security, diplomatic, political and economic initiatives now
underway and monitor compliance with any practical measures--however
limited--one or both sides undertook.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties would have an incentive to cooperate. Israel, which
remains in charge in the territories, clearly has an interest in
seeing security measures enhanced, humanitarian assistance to
Palestinians improved and institutional reforms established. The
government has voiced support for each of these policies and has
started taking practical measures, such as the increased access to
Palestinian areas for international aid groups announced last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians have always favored international
involvement--the more the better. Moreover, their plight is so severe
now that any potential assistance can only improve things.</TE>
<TE>   An American-led delegation might not have prevented the bombing,
but if a U.S. representative on the ground had concluded that the
Palestinian cease-fire effort was genuine, that American mediator
certainly would have held more sway with Sharon than the Europeans.
This official, speaking with the full backing of the president and
secretary of State, might have asked Sharon to at least delay the
military action. It's unlikely an Israeli prime minister would have
refused such a request, even if he had doubts--especially now, when
Israel is receiving strong support from the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   From then on, the situation might have been different. Perhaps the
Palestinian effort would have come to naught. But if it had been
serious, an opportunity for progress could have been nurtured.</TE>

<HD>Rent Control Law Allows Increases for Utilities</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I live in Reseda. To protest my 6% rent increase, I showed
the property manager one of your columns indicating that rent
increases for apartments under Los Angeles rent control are limited
to 3%.</LD>
<LD>   I was told that they can raise the rent higher because they pay
for my utilities and electric. Can you explain the fine print?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Landlords under L.A. city rent control are allowed to
charge an additional 1% per utility if they pay for your electric
and/or gas bills.</LD>
<TE>   They must pay the entire bill in order to increase your rent by
1%.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, if the landlord pays for the gas to heat the water,
but does not pay for the other gas expenses, such as the furnace or
oven, he may not increase the rent by 1% for the gas.</TE>
<TE>   In your case, assuming the landlord pays all of the utility bills
(electric, gas and, probably, water), he can assess you a 5% annual
rent increase. That's the annually allowed 3% plus 1% for gas and 1%
for electric for 5% total. He cannot raise your rent 6% based solely
on the general annual adjustment plus utility increases.</TE>
<TE>   It sounds as if he is charging you 1% each for the gas, electric
and water. Although he is allowed to charge for the gas and electric,
he is not allowed to charge 1% for the water or 1% for the newest
utility expense, sewer service fees.</TE>
<TE>   City of San Gabriel Not Subject to Rent Control</TE>
<TE>   Q: I moved into my apartment in November 1999. The rent was $650.
Now, I am paying $705 per month. I thought that landlords in L.A.
could only increase rents by 3% per year. I live in San Gabriel. Is
the landlord doing something illegal? If so, can I get the overpaid
rent back?</TE>
<TE>   A: The landlord is not doing anything illegal, and there is no
overpaid rent to get back. Los Angeles city rent control applies only
to the city of Los Angeles. The city of San Gabriel is a separate and
distinct entity with its own laws, rules and regulations.</TE>
<TE>   However, your San Gabriel landlord would not be overcharging by
much if you were under Los Angeles rent control. Under L.A. rent
control, allowing 3% annual rent increases, the landlord would be
allowed to raise your rent from $689 to $710 this November.</TE>
<TE>   Roommates Are Both Liable for the Rent</TE>
<TE>   Q: I live in Anaheim with a roommate. We leased the apartment for
11 months and still have four months to go on the lease. My roommate
wants to move now, before the lease is up, and her plan is to get
evicted for nonpayment of rent.</TE>
<TE>   Although I am willing to stay until the lease is up, I can't
afford the rent without her.</TE>
<TE>   Can the landlord force me to pay the full rent?</TE>
<TE>   Am I solely accountable for my irresponsible roommate?</TE>
<TE>   A: Most leases and rental agreements provide that the tenants are
"jointly and severally" responsible for the rent.</TE>
<TE>   This means that you are responsible both together and alone for
the full amount of the rent.</TE>
<TE>   If your roommate moves and you stay, you will be responsible for
the full rent.</TE>
<TE>   Getting a new roommate, with the landlord's permission, would seem
to be a reasonable solution to the problem.</TE>
<TE>   While you are not solely accountable for your irresponsible
roommate, she could damage your credit rating and your ability to get
another apartment, among other things, if she goes forward with her
plan to get evicted for nonpayment of rent.</TE>
<TE>   If she is evicted for nonpayment of rent, you will be evicted
right along with her, which will show up on your credit report,
damaging both your credit ratings.</TE>
<TE>   That will make it much harder to get your next apartment,
especially when the eviction is based on nonpayment of rent.</TE>
<TE>   Because you are on a lease, you also could be responsible for the
remaining four months' rent. The landlord does have to make efforts
to mitigate the damages by trying to re-lease the apartment, but if
this is not successful, you could be stuck.</TE>
<TE>   Evictions are usually handled by attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   If you lose the eviction (and I can't imagine how you could win if
the eviction is based on nonpayment of rent) you will pay attorney
fees and court costs.</TE>
<TE>   Relocation Fee Is Only for Tenants in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I live in a mobile home park in Santa Clarita. The park is
being redeveloped into a shopping center. All tenants will relocate
their homes to the upper side of the park or sell them.</TE>
<TE>   Do relocation fees apply to mobile home tenants in Santa Clarita?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm sorry, they do not. You are referring to the city of Los
Angeles' rent stabilization law, which only applies to rentals in Los
Angeles.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Escrow is to home buying what engagement is to marriage. After a
lengthy and often frustrating search, you find the perfect house or
spouse. To demonstrate your commitment, you tender a
bank-account-breaking deposit or engagement ring.</LD>
<LD>   Next, you agree to a future date on which to exchange title and
money (escrow) or rings and vows (marriage). You spend the time in
between the proposal and the Big Day investigating whether your
potential house or spouse is all that it or he or she appears to be.
Meanwhile, your intended is analyzing whether you have the financial
means to be partnered for many years.</LD>
<LD>   While most escrows and engagements ultimately lead to commitments,
many--experts estimate 10% to 20% of Southern California escrows--do
not. Vanessa Garcia learned the hard way that being "in escrow"
doesn't necessarily lead to homeownership.</LD>
<TE>   Garcia and her boyfriend, Efrain Sanchez, were initially thrilled
when the seller of a home in Oxnard agreed to accept their $229,000
purchase offer. According to the terms of the purchase contract,
Garcia and Sanchez deposited a hard-earned $6,000 with Lawyers' Title
Co.'s escrow division.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of a counselor at the Cabrillo Economic Development
Center, an organization dedicated to helping low-income residents
become first-time homeowners, the couple had pre-qualified for a
loan.</TE>
<TE>   Troubles began for Garcia and Sanchez shortly after escrow opened.
At the time Garcia had entered into the purchase agreement for the
home, she was still married to her estranged husband. The lender
would not fund the loan without a written release from him, but she
was unable to obtain one.</TE>
<TE>   With the closing date looming, Garcia verbally requested an
extension. Believing that her request had been granted, Garcia
continued to try to obtain financing. In the meantime, the seller had
re-listed the home and increased the asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia found out the hard way that she had lost the house to
another buyer. While walking past the residence she noticed a moving
van. She was shocked to discover that the movers were unloading
someone else's furniture into "her" home.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all bummed out--sad and depressed," Garcia said. "I was
crying."</TE>
<TE>   Now, nearly a year after making an offer on the property, Garcia
and Sanchez still live with Sanchez's parents. To add insult to
injury, the escrow company is holding their deposit. Linda McClain,
the escrow officer who handled the transaction, said she is unable to
release the deposit without joint instructions from the seller too.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Garcia's and Sanchez's income did not keep pace with
the supercharged Southern California real estate market.</TE>
<TE>   "[Comparable] houses have gone up to about $300,000," Garcia said,
"so now I feel like we will never be able to afford a house."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Patterson, vice president and Ventura County escrow manager
of Fidelity National Title Co., said that a buyer's inability to
qualify for a loan--which prevented Garcia's escrow from closing--is
a frequent cause of escrow failures.</TE>
<TE>   According to Patterson, who is also a member of the Ventura County
Escrow Assn., the other common reasons that escrows fail to close
are: the buyer's income decreases; the inspector discovers a
substantial defect during the physical inspection; and/or the buyer
discovers something negative about the property or the homeowners
association during the initial "due diligence" period.</TE>
<TE>   Although escrow today is a rigid and frequently intimidating
process, it did not start out that way. In the early days of this
country, when legal descriptions of real property might read "from
the big oak in front of the Smiths' house to the well on the Jones'
farm," the transfer of property from buyer to seller was quick and
simple. The seller and buyer, who most likely knew each other well,
would simultaneously exchange a deed for cash or a bank check.</TE>
<TE>   But as cities grew, the parties to real estate transactions were
less likely to be personally acquainted, causing proof of ownership
to become a serious concern. In the 1880s, the first title insurance
policies were written to quell anxieties over whether a seller was
the legal owner of the property he was attempting to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Approximately a decade after title insurance policies became a
common part of real estate transactions, the first escrow in Southern
California supposedly occurred when a man, on his way out of town,
asked the title insurance clerk to deliver his deed, collect the
money from the buyer and send him the sum of $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Although today's highly regulated and paper-intensive escrows
barely resemble their early "I'll give you the title if you give me
the cash" predecessors, the basic philosophy underlying the
system--permitting a neutral party to participate in real property
transactions so that both parties are protected--remains unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   The modern-day escrow officer is legally obligated to precisely
follow the escrow instructions agreed to at the beginning of the
transaction by the buyer and the seller. The buyer's and seller's
personal concerns--"Did I overpay for the property?" "Can I live with
green carpet?"--do not fall within the escrow holder's domain.</TE>
<TE>   Lola Levoy, owner of Beverly Hills Escrow and a practicing escrow
agent with 37 years' experience, said that she sees more residential
properties falling out of escrow today than at any time in her
career. Levoy theorizes that the overheated Southern California real
estate market is the culprit.</TE>
<TE>   "Buyers are overbidding to get into properties, and sellers spend
the time during escrow questioning whether they sold too low. The
result is that both the buyer and seller are very nervous that they
made a mistake, and may attempt to back out of the deal," she
explained.</TE>
<TE>   She sees savvy real estate brokers agreeing to very short escrows
so that their clients will not have time to dwell on their decision.</TE>
<TE>   According to Levoy, the best way for a buyer to achieve a positive
escrow experience is to carefully read the purchase agreement, and to
communicate his intentions to the seller.</TE>
<TE>   "The buyer falls in love with the beautiful Tiffany lamp over the
breakfast nook and assumes that it is part of the deal," Levoy said.
"Meanwhile, the seller has no intention of parting with Auntie's
heirloom. Buyers are so caught up in the house and whether or not
their furniture will fit that they don't read the escrow
instructions."</TE>

<TE>   TIMELINE</TE>
<TE>   The following timeline is based on a hypothetical 30-day escrow.
Individual escrows may follow a different schedule and require
different documents.</TE>
<TE>   DAY 1</TE>
<TE>   Buyer and seller sign residential purchase agreement and joint
escrow instruction form and any other documents required by real
estate agents. Buyer makes a good-faith deposit.</TE>
<TE>   DAY 2</TE>
<TE>   Residential purchase agreement, joint escrow instructions and
good-faith deposit are delivered to the escrow company.</TE>
<TE>   DAY 3</TE>
<TE>   Escrow company sends out additional escrow instructions and other
pertinent documents to buyer and seller, brokers and buyer's lender.</TE>
<TE>   DAYS 4-10</TE>
<TE>   Buyer and seller return all escrow documents. Buyer proceeds with
physical/geological inspections on the property. (Buyer typically has
14 days from the date of acceptance to complete these inspections.)
Buyer's lender provides written loan approval and time frame for loan
documents.</TE>
<TE>   DAYS 11-18</TE>
<TE>   Termite report is prepared. Preliminary title report, natural
hazard disclosures report, city reports, retrofit ordinances and
homeowners association documents (if any) are sent to the buyer and
seller.</TE>
<TE>   DAYS 19-21</TE>
<TE>   Buyer and seller approve any outstanding conditions.</TE>
<TE>   DAY 22</TE>
<TE>   Loan documents are sent to escrow company.</TE>
<TE>   DAY 23</TE>
<TE>   Buyer signs loan documents. Balance due is wire-transferred to
escrow company.</TE>
<TE>   DAY 24</TE>
<TE>   Loan documents are returned to lender.</TE>
<TE>   DAYS 25-27</TE>
<TE>   Lender reviews documents. Buyer's closing funds must be deposited
into escrow before lender funds the loan.</TE>
<TE>   DAY 28</TE>
<TE>   Lender schedules transfer of funds.</TE>
<TE>   DAY 29</TE>
<TE>   Title receives lender's wired funds. The escrow company authorizes
the title company to release documents for recording the next day.</TE>
<TE>   DAY 30</TE>
<TE>   Escrow closes when escrow holder receives confirmation that title
was recorded.</TE>

<HD>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Jaffe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Which party selects the escrow company?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The buyer or the buyer's real estate agent usually chooses
the escrow company. The seller can agree to the buyer's selection or
counter with another choice.</LD>
<LD>   Although the seller generally acquiesces to the buyer's
suggestion, the selection of the escrow company is negotiable. If the
buyer and seller can't agree on the escrow company, the negotiations
to purchase the property can fail.</LD>
<TE>   Q: Does the buyer or seller pay the cost of escrow?</TE>
<TE>   A: Nearly all closing costs, including the costs of escrow, are
negotiable. In Southern California (practices differ elsewhere), the
buyer and seller customarily split the cost of escrow services.</TE>
<TE>   The seller typically pays for the title policy and the realty
agents' commissions, as well as a hefty documentary transfer tax.
(The tax can range from $1.10 per thousand to more than $8 per
thousand, depending on where in California the property is located.)</TE>
<TE>   Q: Can the escrow officer solve disputes between the parties?</TE>
<TE>   A: California law prohibits an escrow officer from favoring the
lender, the buyer or the seller. An escrow officer's power is
strictly limited to following the escrow instructions agreed to at
the time of purchase and written modifications to those instructions
signed by both parties. The escrow officer does not have the power to
referee disputes between the parties.</TE>
<TE>   Where the buyer and seller have a dispute concerning a
contingency, the escrow company will wait until the buyer and seller
settle the dispute and issue a joint instruction. Where the parties
cannot resolve the dispute on their own, they may seek court
intervention.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Does an escrow officer have to be licensed?</TE>
<TE>   A: Although escrow agencies that employ escrow officers have to
comply with various state licensing requirements, individual escrow
officers--the person who actually handles the escrow--are not
licensed. (However, many escrow officers receive continuing education
through their local branch of the California Escrow Assn.)</TE>
<TE>   California permits several types of escrow companies. Each type is
controlled by a different regulatory agency.</TE>
<TE>   Independent escrow companies process the majority of the
transactions initiated in Southern California and are regulated by
California's Department of Corporations. They are required by law to
maintain a specific level of liquid assets and have at least one
experienced escrow officer on duty at all times.</TE>
<TE>   Title insurance companies, a popular option for escrows in
Northern California, are regulated by California's Department of
Insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Banks and savings and loans frequently provide escrow services and
are typically regulated by the same agency (the state banking
commissioner or FDIC) that regulates the bank. Similarly,
broker-owned escrow providers are regulated by California's real
estate commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   If you are not certain as to what type of escrow agency is
handling your escrow, check your escrow instructions. Under
California law, all instructions must contain the name of the escrow
company, its regulatory agency and its license number.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What factors should be considered when choosing an escrow
company?</TE>
<TE>   A: Escrow is a relationship business. Your broker will typically
recommend an escrow officer whom he or she has successfully worked
with in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Important factors to consider are the level of experience of the
individual who will be acting as the escrow officer, the financial
strength and stability of the company and the price charged for
escrow services. It would also be wise to inquire whether or not the
escrow officer will be available throughout the escrow period (no
planned vacations or leave).</TE>
<TE>   Q: If the buyer and seller are unhappy with the service being
provided, can they switch companies in the middle of escrow?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. The catch is that both the buyer and seller must agree on
two things: first, that the escrow company should be terminated, and
second, they must agree on the new escrow company.</TE>
<TE>   When the buyer and seller satisfy these prerequisites they must
notify the original escrow officer of the change in writing and
instruct the original officer to transfer the deposit and relevant
documents to the new company.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What if the conditions set forth in the escrow instructions and
real estate agreement cannot be performed before the closing date?</TE>
<TE>   A: If both the seller and the buyer agree, the closing date can be
extended by written instruction to the escrow officer. However, if
the seller wants to back out of the deal for whatever reason, he can
choose not to extend the time. Assuming that the seller wants the
deal to close (which is generally the case), the seller may request
an increase in the deposit.</TE>
<TE>   If the only condition that has not been satisfied involves a
contractor making repairs or changes to the property identified by
the home inspector, the parties can instruct the escrow officer to
hold funds to be paid to the contractor until after the sale closes
and the work is completed.</TE>
<TE>   Q: If the escrow officer fails to follow the escrow instructions,
what remedies are available?</TE>
<TE>   A: The Department of Corporations regulates independent escrow
companies. In the event that the buyer or seller is having a problem
with the escrow company, he or she may contact the Department of
Corporations at (800) 347-6995 or go through its Web site at
www.corp.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   If the Department of Corporations determines that a violation has
occurred, the escrow company will be required to make a correction or
issue a refund.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Corporations received about 100 escrow-related
complaints in 2001. Nearly one-half of the complaints concerned an
escrow agent's alleged failure to follow escrow instructions.</TE>
<TE>   For complaints concerning escrow services supplied through a title
insurance company, contact the Department of Insurance at (800)
927-4357 or on the Web go through www.insurance.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What can a buyer and seller do to ensure that escrow proceeds
smoothly?</TE>
<TE>   A: The single most important thing that the buyer and seller can
do is to read the escrow instructions.</TE>
<TE>   The escrow instructions, contained in the real estate purchase
agreement, identify which party must do what and when.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as you have consummated a deal to purchase or sell a home,
make a list of the relevant events that need to be completed, making
sure to identify the relevant period of time for completion.</TE>
<TE>   Always check all documents to make sure that names, including
middle names and initials, are spelled correctly. If you notice a
mistake, notify the escrow officer in writing immediately.</TE>
<TE>   It is wise for you or your broker to contact your escrow agent
regularly throughout the escrow period to ensure that everything is
proceeding on schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Q: If escrow doesn't close, is the buyer entitled to have his or
her deposit returned?</TE>
<TE>   A: According to California Civil Code section 1057.3, it is "the
obligation of a buyer and seller who enter into a contract to
purchase and sell real property to ensure that all funds deposited
into an escrow account are returned to the person who deposited the
funds or who is otherwise entitled to the funds under the contract,
if the purchase of the property is not completed by the date set
forth in the contract for the close of escrow or any [extension]."</TE>
<TE>   If a buyer or seller fails to sign off on a document that would
release the escrow funds within 30 days and there is no real dispute
over these funds, then the party who fails to sign the release may be
liable for three times the amount wrongfully held (not less than $100
and not more than $1,000) and attorney's fees.</TE>
<TE>   If one party sues the other to receive the funds, the escrow
holder must deposit the sum in dispute with the court.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How is the length of escrow determined?</TE>
<TE>   A: The realty agent will typically negotiate a closing date based
on the time that it takes for a lending institution to process a
loan, and for the contingencies agreed to in the purchase agreement
to be satisfied. Unless the deal is all cash, a minimum of 30 days is
generally needed for the loan to fund and for the necessary
inspections to be completed.</TE>

<LD>David W. Tong, an architect from Hong Kong who graduated from the USC
School of Architecture, designed this house for his father as a
thank-you gift.</LD>
<LD>   "It was kind of like repaying my school loan," said the younger
Tong, who envisioned his family in Hong Kong periodically coming to
the house to visit. But while Tong was building the house, his father
bought his own dream house in Hong Kong and started staying there
more often.</LD>
<LD>   Tong, 39, already had a home with his wife and young child near
the beach in Santa Monica, so he listed this one. It incorporates
"some basic feng shui," he said.</LD>
<TE>   About this house: Tong likens it to an armchair facing the ocean,
noting that water features dominate. All six of the bedroom suites
have ocean views, and there is a 50-foot pool, a spa and a pool
pavilion. Outside, there are also gardens and a procession of
promenades, courtyards and colonnaded verandas.</TE>
<TE>   "Torrette Chiare dal Mare" (Light Towers by the Sea) was built to
last many generations, because "it was intended for my father, our
[extended] family and our children," Tong said.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $5,995,000</TE>
<TE>   Size: Besides the six bedrooms, there are 6 1/2 bathrooms in 7,500
square feet. The house is on 1.33 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The home has five fireplaces, two family rooms, a
two-story entry, a library, a projection theater/garden ballroom. The
grounds also include an art gallery; a butler's pantry, an office
with a separate entry; a north/south tennis court with spectator
area, a quarter-mile fitness/exercise trail and a cobbled, circular
motor plaza with additional parking for four cars and two RVs. The
site is zoned for horses and has access to trails, stables and a
park.</TE>

<LD>John Spencer, who plays presidential chief of staff Leo McGarry in
the Emmy-winning NBC series "The West Wing," has put his Bel-Air home
on the market at $849,000.</LD>
<LD>   Spencer listed the home because he bought a larger $2-million
house in the Hollywood Hills area, real estate sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The Bel-Air home has two bedrooms and three bathrooms in 1,821
square feet.</LD>
<TE>   Built in 1962 but remodeled recently, the home's kitchen has
granite counters, a sunny breakfast area and French doors that
overlook a pool.</TE>
<TE>   The house also has a master suite with a steam shower, spa tub and
walk-in cedar closet.</TE>
<TE>   The living and dining rooms have high ceilings and wood floors,
and the living room has a fireplace.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer has called the home a good-luck charm for his career. He
has owned the home, previously owned by actress Jill Clayburgh, since
1998.</TE>
<TE>   He has been a member of the ensemble cast of "The West Wing" since
the show first aired in 1999. In 1998, he played the patriarch of an
Irish Catholic family in the short-lived NBC drama "Trinity." From
1990-94, he played lawyer Tommy Mullaney on the NBC series "L.A.
Law."</TE>
<TE>   Spencer, 55, also has had an extensive career on stage and in
film.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, he starred in the Broadway production, "Execution of
Justice," playing Dan White, who killed San Francisco Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. Last year, Spencer played a jazz
musician in the L.A. premiere of the play "Glimmer, Glimmer and
Shine."</TE>
<TE>   He has appeared in such movies as "WarGames" (1983), "Sea of Love"
(1989), "The Rock" (1996) and "The Negotiator" (1998).</TE>

<TE>   Morris Chestnut, who stars with Lil' Bow Wow in the recently
released movie "Like Mike" and co-stars with Steven Seagal in the
upcoming fall film "Half Past Dead," has purchased a Calabasas estate
for about $1.5 million and has sold his former Granada Hills home for
close to $769,000.</TE>
<TE>   Chestnut, who made his movie debut about 10 years ago playing the
doomed high school athlete Ricky Baker in John Singleton's movie
"Boyz N the Hood," bought a five-bedroom, $1.5-million home with a
pool, spa and waterfall.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1995, the 4,700-square-foot home also has 4 1/2
bathrooms, a family room, a library, a breakfast room, three
fireplaces and mountain views.</TE>
<TE>   The Granada Hills home, built in 2000, has five bedrooms and four
bathrooms in nearly 3,900 square feet. It is on 1.5 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Chestnut, 33, also has appeared in the TV movie "The Killing Yard"
(2001), and such feature films as "The Brothers" (2001), "The Best
Man" (1999), "G.I. Jane" (1997) and "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory"
(1995).</TE>
<TE>   Chestnut and his Diversified Managed Investments partner Dewayne
Brady are developing other movies and a program to aid, develop and
help inner-city residents to realize homeownership.</TE>
<TE>   Brady, also at Excel Properties in Tarzana, represented Chestnut
in his purchase and sale. Jim Pascucci, at Re/Max Centre Estates in
Calabasas, had the Calabasas listing.</TE>

<TE>   Josh Randall, who plays Ed's friend Mike on the NBC comedy series
"Ed," and his wife, actress Claire Rankin, have become first-time
home buyers with their purchase of a two-bedroom home near Hancock
Park for $479,000.</TE>
<TE>   The couple bought the home from Edward L. McDonnell, producer of
such movies as "Insomnia" (2002) and "Three Kings" (1999).</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell moved to a larger home that he purchased in the
Hollywood Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The home that Randall and Rankin bought is Country English in
style and has two bedrooms and 1 3/4 bathrooms in slightly more than
1,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1942, the home was recently refurbished and has a new
kitchen, central air-conditioning and an alarm system. The house also
has a fireplace.</TE>
<TE>   Randall, 30, made his breakthrough in 2000 with a regular role as
the young doctor on "Ed."</TE>
<TE>   Rankin has made guest appearances on such TV shows as "The
District" (2000), "Ally McBeal" (1997) and "The Drew Carey Show"
(1995).</TE>
<TE>   Steven Kipnis of DBL Realtors, Sunset, represented the buyers;
Carl Williams of the same firm had the listing and represented
McDonnell in buying.</TE>

<TE>   Veronica Hamel, an Eileen Ford model for 10 years before she
played public defender Joyce Davenport on the NBC series "Hill Street
Blues" (1981-87), has sold a Westside home listed at slightly more
than $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Hamel, who has had recent recurring roles on the TV series
"Philly" and "The Fugitive," had owned the home since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1928, the Mediterranean-style villa has four bedrooms and
four bathrooms in 3,700 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The house also has a pool, rolling lawns, rose gardens and a
master suite with a balcony.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Hamel, 58, appeared on "Third Watch" with other former
cast members of "Hill Street Blues" to help celebrate NBC's 75th
anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Litt, co-creator of the TV series "The King of Queens" and a
writer-executive producer of the upcoming Touchstone Television

<TE>   He will host a pro-celebrity tennis match today at the Manhattan
Beach Country Club. She is a former NCAA singles champion.</TE>
<TE>   They have lived in the home with their four sons for five years.

four-bathroom home that they bought at the Tennis Estates in
Palisades Highlands.</TE>
<TE>   The home they are selling has four bedrooms and 4 1/2 bathrooms in
just under 2,900 square feet. Built in 1979, the Tudor-style home on

Chad Lowe.</TE>
<TE>   Adidas recently used the court for magazine ads and TV
commercials, and Tennis Magazine has featured the property in

recording studio. It could serve as an extra bedroom, screening room
or studio.</TE>
<TE>   The half-acre grounds also have more than 50 fruit trees.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Credit Problems Delay Family's Dream" by Alison B. Cohen
(July 14): I have no idea whether anyone gave Angelo and Kathy Bell
advice between 1996 and 1998, but if so, it was lousy advice.</LD>
<LD>   They lost their car due to a job loss that was medically related,
therefore they could have legally, and I think morally, declared
bankruptcy. Not only that, but since the bankruptcy was related to
medical problems, which would be considered circumstances beyond the
buyer's control, the Bells could have bought that same home at a low
interest rate for far less two years ago, through FHA financing, and
been in better shape today.</LD>
<LD>   FHA allows a buyer to purchase a home 24 months after a bankruptcy
is finalized and sometimes 12 months after finalization, if the
bankruptcy was due to circumstances beyond the buyer's control.</LD>

<HD>HUD Proposal Would Guarantee Cost of Loan Closing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>From Bloomberg News</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development filed its
proposed rule changes governing the mortgage lending process in the
Federal Register last week, sending the topic to a public debate.</LD>
<LD>   The changes proposed by HUD to the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act, or RESPA, would guarantee closing costs and make it
harder for lenders to increase rates and fees after a home buyer
applies for a mortgage.</LD>
<LD>   HUD also wants to ease rules preventing lenders and brokers from
packaging appraisals, title searches and other services for one fee.</LD>
<TE>   Companies such as Cendant Corp., a mortgage lender and owner of
the Coldwell Banker, Century 21 and ERA residential brokerages have
argued that RESPA, which was enacted in 1974, needs to be reformed to
streamline the lending process and give consumers more information
about fees they would pay.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very encouraged by the changes," said Rod Alba, director
of government affairs at the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America. "Much
of this is what industry groups have been pushing for."</TE>
<TE>   The public will have a 90-day period in which to comment on the
changes after which the rules will take effect or additional changes
will be made.</TE>
<TE>   By making fees more transparent, large companies that can offer
widespread discounts over their smaller competitors would probably
benefit the most from the reforms being proposed by HUD Secretary Mel
Martinez, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "For the industry as a whole, the reform will empower companies
that already have an integrated, bundled approach toward real estate
offerings," said Jeffrey Kessler, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. "It
could hurt some small mortgage and title brokers who offer individual
services."</TE>
<TE>   A controversial aspect of HUD's proposals is the guarantee of
mortgage rates, said Joe Kolar, a real estate attorney at
Boston-based law firm Goodwin Procter. Rates are determined, in part,
by the prices of mortgage-backed securities bought and sold by
investors, and are out of the control of lenders, he said.</TE>
<TE>   If mortgage rates were to suddenly rise, industry groups are
worried that under the new rules a lender may still be forced to
offer the lower rate they guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   HUD's recommendations include a change in the way mortgage broker
compensation is presented to consumers by requiring fees to the
brokers be included as part of the loan interest rate. These payments
are easy to miss on the list of fees, said Brian Sullivan, a HUD
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, home buyers suffer from "sticker shock," Sullivan
said. Not only do they not know how much they are paying for the
different services needed to complete the purchase of a home, they
are not being given the opportunity to shop around, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The reform "is going to make the entire industry sharpen their
pencils," said John Kennedy, associate general counsel for HUD.</TE>

<LD>The angle at which he sat at a school desk: low and slightly back,
not overly cool, pretty much what you'd expect from a kid with baggy
pants and expensive sneakers. ''I don't mind following rules,'' he
said. ''Unless they're stupid.'' If a teacher made him spit out his
gum, he walked into her room the next day purposely chewing away,
whether he wanted gum or not. He talked in class and rarely did
homework.</LD>
<LD>   And I was going to save him.</LD>

flunking out, get it into his head that he needed to think about the
future, maybe even college. I was going to deliver as much salvation
as could be wedged into one lunchtime a week.</LD>
<TE>   That first Wednesday, we met in a bungalow at his high school, a
room of browns and grays and pale white scribblings on the
chalkboard. I glanced around at others who, like me, had signed up to
help a struggling kid. They hunched over textbooks with their
students, some leaning close, locked into serious conversations.
Anthony wanted no part of it. He wanted to talk about the Lakers and
Dodgers. When I asked about homework, he reached into his pocket and
pulled out a carefully folded sheet of paper, a list of football bets
he had made with classmates. He wanted to know what I thought of his
chances.</TE>
<TE>   It went like this every Wednesday for months. Sometimes I tried to
force the issue. Sometimes I was hesitant, and there were awkward
silences. By winter, his grades had sunk even lower.</TE>
<TE>   If I were honest about what brought me to Anthony Reyes, if I
pushed aside trite explanations, I would say that my wife and I were
struggling to have a baby and I needed an outlet for unrequited
paternal feelings. A sign outside El Camino Real High School in
Woodland Hills asking for mentors was all it took. The woman who runs
the program nods her head when I tell her, three years later, that
something felt wrong from the start. Fern Somoza knows the simple act
of helping is not so simple at all.</TE>
<TE>   Each fall, a handful of volunteers trickles into her office.
Picture a casting call for a regional production of ''To Sir, With
Love,'' a roomful of newcomers determined to lead wayward teens down
the path to righteousness and a passing grade in algebra. Maybe they
have seen a public service ad with some variation of ''change a kid's
life,'' a slogan that irks Somoza to no end. Her students have been
designated ''at risk'' for good reason. They have signed up for her
program, but often under duress from parents and teachers, and they
are not the type to change easily. Somoza warns new mentors to be
patient, let things progress naturally. Still, some grow frustrated
and quit.</TE>
<TE>   Given Anthony's continued descent under my guidance, only one
thing kept me walking into that bungalow each Wednesday: He kept
showing up. This kid who thought nothing of ditching school to spend
the day at Magic Mountain almost never missed our lunch. He began to
open up, telling me about his mother and his aunt, about spending
weekends with his grandparents north of the city. When my wife
eventually became pregnant, I gave him weekly updates and he was
among the first to see snapshots of the baby. We became fixtures in
each other's lives, if only for one afternoon a week. We became
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, an unspoken deal was struck by which we discussed
school for a few minutes each week and he occasionally brought a
sketch from art class or a poem from English. Anthony kept his end of
the bargain, to my considerable relief, raising those failing grades
to Cs and Ds by summer. But if I went on too long about school or his
future, he shrugged and told me not to worry. I was still quietly
embarrassed that other mentors might overhear us debate at length the
relative merits of the Dodger bullpen. Not that I minded talking
sports, but it wasn't what I believed we should be doing.</TE>
<TE>   This unease stayed with me in the way small worries do, forgotten
at times, inevitably resurfacing, pestering. It got me thinking about
the act of helping and, during the spring of our second year, I had a
hunch. Call it a theory. Or an elaborate rationalization.</TE>
<TE>   Every so often there is a story in the news about a government
that builds a factory in some poverty-stricken village halfway around
the globe where, it turns out, the people cannot operate machinery.
Or a humanitarian group distributes condoms in a Third World nation
where religion prohibits birth control. I talked to a man named
Gerald Caiden, a professor of public administration at USC, who
called this ''the clash of values and priorities.'' He told me to
imagine a benefactor shipping textbooks to a country where the
population needs medical care. The people say they must be healthy
before they can study, Caiden said, ''but the donor always assumes it
knows better than the people themselves do.'' That donor, that
wealthy government--that was me.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony knew better. Though the baggy pants and sneakers remained,
he matured into a young man who stopped skipping classes and went to
night school--even missed Laker games on television--to make up for
failed courses. Though he still exasperated teachers, by our third
year his report card included a smattering of As and Bs. Those grades
do not begin to reflect the magnitude of his accomplishment: How many
of us find the gumption to change our destinies? In June, he
graduated.</TE>
<TE>   But this story is not about his transformation. It is about mine.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony taught me about casting aside expectations and finding a
common ground, a tough lesson that I am not convinced has sunk in
yet. To this day, I cannot help wishing he had been more passionate
about his studies, had found something he liked about school rather
than just slogging through. I wish he had learned that following
rules once in awhile, even stupid rules, can save heartache. He
shrugs and tells me not to worry. And I suspect this scenario will
repeat itself, in various forms, with my son Zack as we engage in the
inevitable tussle between father and son, me pushing him to fit an
ideal, him pushing back. The cycle has already begun. Sometimes I
want him to be the kind of toddler that plays quietly with his toys
rather than the type that climbs on chairs and dives off. I try to
keep in mind one of my final meetings with Anthony.</TE>
<TE>   We were sitting in the bungalow, cleaning up scraps from a sausage
pizza, when he announced his decision to give junior college a try
next fall, just to see how it goes. I told him I was proud. Then I
asked the question that had been in the back of my mind all along.</TE>
<TE>   ''Be honest,'' I said. ''Did I have anything to do with your
becoming a better student?''</TE>
<TE>   A curious look crossed his face. ''What do you mean?''</TE>
<TE>   ''I mean, we never went over homework. We hardly ever talked about
school.''</TE>
<TE>   He said that if he had wanted help with assignments, he would have
asked for a tutor. There were plenty of relatives, teachers and
counselors to nag him about his future. He wanted someone to talk to,
if only once a week, if only about Shaquille O'Neal's aching big toe.</TE>
<TE>   I then realized this wasn't about what I expected. It was about
what he needed.</TE>

<HD>Argentine Grilling</HD>
<DH>Barbecuing is the National Pastime in This South American
Country That's Not Afraid of Meat</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMELIA SALTSMAN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Our barbecue life changed the moment our daughter met and married an
Argentine. Within days of making our acquaintance, Rodolfo began to
chip away at our SoCal style, introducing us to the art of the
parilla, or grill. Rodolfo's parents own Hereford--an elegant parilla
restaurant in Buenos Aires' chic Recoleta district, and our
son-in-law has specific ideas about grilling. The truth is, most
Argentines are opinionated experts on the subject of meat. Forget
soccer and tango; grilling is the national pastime.</LD>
<LD>   Portenos (Buenos Aires locals) love gathering on weekends to
barbecue. Parks and country houses have large built-in wood- and
charcoal-burning grills. By noon, children have gathered kindling,
the fire is crackling, and the arrival of guests bearing
contributions to the meal signals the start of a party. An hour
later--after a Campari aperitif, some olives and a bit of cheese--the
first sizzling morsels of carne a la parilla are pulled off the
grill.</LD>
<TE>   An Argentine meal of ribs, steak or chicken feels familiar (think
cowboy/gaucho), but the differences are as intrinsic as the reversal
of seasons from north to south of the equator. For one, Argentines
aren't afraid of meat, any part of it. For another, the country's
substantial Italian population has richly influenced its cuisine. The
remaining distinctions stem from one fundamental principle: Here we
strive to have the meal ready in one frenzied moment, but in
Argentina, the guests wait for the food.</TE>
<TE>   Only one thing rattles our gracious son-in-law: when we aren't
standing by as the meat arrives at its peak, that is, crisped, hot
and juicy. For the asador, or grill master, the day's perk is to hold
court at the fire, sipping red wine, tending the meat as guests pay
homage, then bestowing his handiwork and reaping adulation.
Consequently, the grill must be near the party. I confess our Weber
kettle was once out by the back door, convenient to kitchen but
isolating the cook. Rodolfo soon took care of that.</TE>
<TE>   Our barbecues have become parilladas, mixed grills of astonishing
variety. We often start with provoleta, a grilled smoky disk of aged
provolone cheese dusted with oregano and aji molido (an Argentine red
pepper blend). This is paired with crunchy pieces of salchicha
parillera (coiled pork sausages), a bit of morcilla (blood sausage)
and tender mollejas (sweetbreads grilled with lemon and salt). Or it
works equally well with fragrant baby back ribs brushed with
chimichurri, the oregano-parsley vinaigrette that Argentines use like
ketchup.</TE>
<TE>   Our main course includes several cuts of beef, each celebrated for
its own characteristics and sampled tapas-style. Rodolfo favors juicy
rib-eye, succulent flank-like tira de asado, entrana, crackly crusted
skirt steak, sirloin and porterhouse. I love flavorful, inexpensive
hanger steak or flap meat, also used for Mexican carne asada. Some
backyard afternoons, we feast on build-your-own sandwiches de lomito,
hot tenderloin slices with roasted red peppers and garlic, lemony
mayonnaise, chimichurri, and slices of hard-boiled egg and white
onion piled into French rolls. Perfect with an intense Mendoza Malbec
wine. We serve tangy white beans and lettuce-tomato-onion salad
alongside. For dessert, the spread includes fruit, Rodolfo's
incredible flan and his beloved dulce de leche with ice cream. The
key is to have everything but the meat ready to rock-and-roll
beforehand. I've learned not to stress myself or my personal asador.</TE>
<TE>   Three elements are essential for authentic Argentine grilling:
control of your fire (we've inherited a small Santa Maria-style
barbecue similar to a parilla with a grate that raises and lowers),
hardwood charcoal and good meat. Go to a butcher. Although young
grass-fed Argentine beef isn't allowed into this country (when it
was, Rodolfo found it disappointing), hand-trimmed, dry-aged beef
makes a vast difference, even with inexpensive cuts. Argentine
markets, such as El Gaucho in Redondo Beach, offer Argentine-style
butchering.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, contrary to what we've been taught up north, Argentines
don't sear meat first to seal in juices. Rodolfo starts the meat over
the cooler part of the fire and moves it to the hottest part at the
end to get a perfectly crisped crust. Works every time. Who am I to
argue with an Argentine about his beef?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Provoleta</TE>
<TE>   Serves 8-10</TE>
<TE>   1 pound aged provolone cheese</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano,  or 1 teaspoon dried</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons aji molido or  1/2 teaspoon chile powder</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   freshly ground white pepper</TE>
<TE>   Dredge the cheese in flour, dusting off excess. Mix the remaining
ingredients into a paste and smear half of it over the top of the
cheese. Place cheese spice side up over hot coals and grill until the
cheese begins to melt but still holds its shape and the underside is
scored, about 3 minutes. Flip and brush the second side of the cheese
with remaining spice mixture. Grill until second side is scored. Cut
into wedges and serve immediately. Provoleta may also be prepared on
an indoor grill or in a ridged skillet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sandwiches de Lomito</TE>
<TE>   (Filet Mignon Sandwiches with Marinated Peppers, Chimichurri and
Hard-boiled Eggs)</TE>
<TE>   Serves 8</TE>
<TE>   4 red bell peppers</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 large cloves garlic, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1-2 pound filet mignon or rib-eye</TE>
<TE>   2-3 teaspoons Kosher (coarse) salt</TE>
<TE>   freshly ground black pepper</TE>
<TE>   Chimichurri (recipe follows)</TE>
<TE>   1 white onion, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   3 hard-boiled eggs, sliced</TE>
<TE>   Mayonnaise</TE>
<TE>   8 large French rolls</TE>
<TE>   Light the barbecue, mounding most of the coals to one side to
create hotter and cooler areas. If using a kettle type with
nonadjustable grate, make two piles of coals at the sides, leaving
center as an indirect heat cooking area.</TE>
<TE>   When coals are ashen and glowing (about 30-40 minutes after
lighting), roast peppers over hottest part of fire until they are
blackened on all sides. Remove them to a plate and cover with dish
towel to allow steam to loosen skin. When cool enough to handle, peel
and seed peppers. Cut peppers into inch-wide slices and place in a
shallow serving dish. Pour the olive oil over peppers and sprinkle
with garlic, tucking some in between layers of peppers. (Peppers may
be made several hours ahead, on a grill or under broiler close to
heat source.)</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, rub the meat with salt and pepper; place meat over
indirect heat and grill until juices appear on top, 10-15 minutes.
From time to time, slide the meat over direct heat to brown.</TE>
<TE>   Turn the meat to second side and continue grilling over indirect
heat until almost done, about 10 minutes. Move the meat to hottest
part of grill for 3-5 minutes to crisp the crust. Remove the meat to
a platter and cut into thin slices. Arrange the
condiments--mayonnaise, chimichurri, peppers, onions and hard-boiled
eggs--and have guests assemble their own sandwiches.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tangy White Beans</TE>
<TE>   Serves 8-10</TE>
<TE>   2 cups dried white beans, such as cannelini</TE>
<TE>   or great northern, or 6 cups canned white beans</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, finely minced</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons cider vinegar</TE>
<TE>   Salt to taste</TE>
<TE>   Soak beans in cold water overnight, or do a quick soak by boiling
beans for 3 minutes, removing from heat and allowing to stand 1 hour.
Drain and rinse the beans, return to a large pot and add water to
cover the beans by 1 inch. Simmer the beans until tender, about an
hour. Drain and cool. If using canned beans, drain and rinse beans
and place in bowl. Add garlic, parsley, oil and vinegar and mix
gently. Add salt to taste and mix again. May be made the day before.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chimichurri</TE>
<TE>   10 cloves garlic, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons aji molido or 1 teaspoon chile powder and 1 teaspoon
paprika</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon dried oregano</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 bay leaves</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup corn oil</TE>
<TE>   1 cup red wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   Mix ingredients together and place in a glass jar with
tight-fitting lid. Let age 1-3 days.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Note: Aged provolone and aji molido (Argentine coarsely ground
chile powder) are available at specialty markets and some
supermarkets.</TE>

<LD>Lofty accomplishments are all in a day's work to Mark Drummond. As
chancellor of the Los Angeles Community College District, Drummond
prides himself most on helping create a $1.2-billion bond measure to
upgrade the district's aging classrooms and deteriorating buildings.</LD>
<LD>   ''The girls'' are a close second.</LD>
<LD>   That would be Donut, 10, Cinder, 6, and Arrow, 2, the mules who
live on Drummond's four-acre ranch in Norco. There's also a donkey
named Strawberry. Drummond breeds, trains and sells horses, too, but
his heart belongs to the girls. (''I've never had a boy mule,'' he
says.)</LD>
<TE>   And the girls like Drummond: His mules are standouts on the
competition circuit. Cinder took first place in the Western Trail
Course at the 2001 Los Angeles County Fair, though she fared less
well at the Mule Days Celebration in Bishop this spring. ''I gave her
a bad cue during the pole-bending competition and she missed being
one of the top 10 finalists by four-tenths of a second,'' Drummond
recalls. (Pole-bending, it seems, is a kind of slalom skiing event
for mules.) However, Strawberry placed fourth in pole-bending and
came in sixth in donkey pleasure-riding. "She's only 2 and she was up
against champions, so that's pretty good,'' says Drummond.</TE>
<TE>   Mule mania set in for Drummond when he was growing up in Northern
California. While spending time with his father, who used mules and
horses to hunt and fish after a disabling logging accident, Drummond
learned to care for the animals on the trail. He found he preferred
horses for riding, but became better friends with the mules. ''They
were more devilish and conducive to building friendships, and they
like to play tricks,'' he says. ''I played hide and seek with a mule
once up in the Sierra Nevada.''</TE>
<TE>   To review the zoology, a mule is the sterile offspring of a horse
and a donkey. As Drummond puts it, each mule is its own family and
its own family tree. Mule aficionados are something of a subculture
even within the equestrian community, Drummond says. He estimates the
U.S. mule population at about 300,000, compared to about 1.7 million
horses, and notes that mules are used mainly for recreation, while
some do farm work and others serve as pack animals for trail treks,
firefighting and search-and-rescue missions.</TE>
<TE>   As for that ''stubborn as a mule'' thing, Drummond insists it's a
canard born of the mule's superior intelligence. ''Anybody who knows
animals knows that a mule is half again as smart as a horse,'' he
says. ''Mules have the reputation of being stubborn, but it's because
they ask questions. They want to know why they are doing something. A
horse reacts to fear, but a mule has a whole different perspective.
He wants to know why, and if you don't answer the questions for him,
he plants his feet and says, 'No, I'm not going to do it.' It's not
obstinate, it's a highly developed personality. The mule must think
about it and decide what to do after its questions are answered.''</TE>

<DH>A designer brings her 1930s bungalow into the 21st century
with creative use of space</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA THORNBURG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Designer Julie Hart was smitten with the Sunset Park neighborhood of
Santa Monica and its quiet streets lined with California bungalows.
Many of these homes were developed during the '30s and '40s when
McDonnell Douglas had a plant on Ocean Park Boulevard, and a few
former employees still live in the area, as well as a growing number
of young families with children.</LD>
<LD>   Hart saw the neighborhood's potential. After leasing a house in
the area for two years, she and her partner, Monet LeMon, a vice
president for executive recruiting firm TRRG, purchased the modest
1936 one-story house and began renovating. An admirer of mid-century
architects Craig Ellwood and Cliff May as well as Shaker traditions,
Hart transformed the 925-square-foot home into a 21st century gem by
combining clean Modernist lines with Shaker simplicity and
functionalism. ``It's so much fun to watch people's faces when they
walk into the house for the first time,'' she says. ``On the outside
it's still very traditional with its clapboard siding and small
porch, and then you walk into this very nontraditional interior.''</LD>
<TE>   Among the things Hart needed to address in the house were issues
of light, circulation and storage. She began by opening up the home's
warren of tiny, dark rooms to create one large loft-like space for
the living, dining and cooking areas. ``The house was so small, we
needed to utilize all the space all the time,'' says the designer.
The open floor plan allows her to cook in the kitchen while having a
conversation with guests a few feet away in the living room. To
further enlarge the room, Hart removed the claustrophobic 7-foot-high
ceiling, revealing the 13-foot-high pitched gabled roof. ``I crawled
up into the attic and I thought `this is all just wasted space.' ''
So she installed a new skylight in the roof, paneled the ceiling with
pine and painted it a high-gloss white to brighten the once-dim
interior.</TE>
<TE>   Hart also wanted to establish a relationship between the home's
interior and the outdoors. ``Typically you used the door of the
laundry room to get to the backyard. These houses had almost no link
with the outside,'' she says. Two pairs of wood slider doors now open
onto a new redwood deck. Steps lead from the deck to the yard and a
newly enlarged garage, which doubles as LeMon's home office. A bright
orange ``Mr. Ed''-style door playfully marks the entrance. ``Dutch
doors are brilliant. They allow you to bring in light and air while
maintaining your privacy and hiding junk you don't want anyone to
see,'' says Hart, who liked the door so well she created another from
an existing door in her own office inside the house.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to reconfiguring the living spaces, Hart transformed a
small second bedroom into a master bath and walk-in closet, and then
added a 275-square-foot master bedroom onto the back of the house. A
large casement window overlooks the yard while the hopper window
above brings in cooling breezes. Storage was perhaps the biggest
challenge in redesigning a small home occupied by women. ``I had to
add storage anyplace I could,'' Hart says. Eighteen feet of storage
cabinets, which serve as both pantry and closet, line the wall beside
the dining table and hold everything from dishes to shoes. Nearby, a
free-standing central island dividing the dining and kitchen area
stores pots and pans. More than three dozen Shaker-style pegs line
the interior hallway, where Hart and LeMon hang purses, jackets, hats
and scarves. Extra bed linens and pillows hide in a giant pull-out
drawer beneath a king-size bed.</TE>
<TE>   ``With a few Modernist changes these small bungalows can become
delightful, clean-lined homes of warmth and character,'' Hart says.
``Not everyone needs to live in an architectural statement to enjoy
where they live.''</TE>

<LD>I am an Orange County conservative, an ex-World War II Marine,
well-educated and hard-nosed as hell. Consequently, I don't choke up
easily. However, J. Michael Kennedy's story ("Truth and Consequences
on the Reserva-tion," July 7) almost brought me to tears. What can
you possibly say about Elouise Cobell of the Blackfeet Nation that
begins to be adequate? It's too bad that people like her only come
along once in a while. How much better the world would be if it were
full of Elouise Cobells.</LD>
<LD>   I guess most of us have some goal in life. Hers just happens to
involve two nations and thou-sands of people. The one thing that
worries me is, what happens when the Native Americans' lawsuit
against the federal government for land-use payments is over? What
will she do? How do you replace a life ambition? That's a pretty hard
act to follow.</LD>

<HD>Brave Patriots, and a Word of Caution</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bravo to James Ricci's amusing take on "School</LD>
<LD>   Nicknames: Let There Be Color" (Metropolis, July 7). However, some
clarity is in order. The photo of a Brave at Birmingham High School,
whose mascot was changed for some of the same inept, politically
correct reasoning that would ban race- and ethnic-based school
nicknames, is misleading. Birmingham High is now the home of the
Patriots, having bowed to pressure to abandon the name "Braves" in
1998.</LD>
<LD>   The expense incurred by changing the mascot could have been used
more judiciously (books, perhaps?). Yet, as a member of Birmingham's
staff, acutely aware of the school site's history as a World War II
Army hospital and appalled by the shadow of 9/11, I know that
Patriots is a name we also wear proudly. Birmingham will always be
both "Brave" and "Patriot" for the positive qualities these words
have long implied.</LD>
<TE>   Jeanine D'Elia</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am surprised at the level of ignorance revealed in Ricci's
column. Native Americans do not appreciate being cast as athletic
team mascots for the resulting purpose of entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   We do not interpret it as an honorable acknowledgment,</TE>
<TE>   as some mistakenly believe. An especially offensive issue is the
desecration of our sacred objects and ceremonies. The feathers of
various birds illustrate this point because they are commonly worn by
mascots and cheerleaders who dance around like buffoons in war paint
and elaborate, feathered costumes, ranting and raving in contrived,
amplified voices, whooping it up to stir up the players and audience.</TE>
<TE>   It is obvious that [sacred objects] are not in accordance with
rambunctious cheerleading purposes. Native Americans instinctively
understand their spirituality, and they don't want to play any part
in their desecration. Allowing this type of disrespectful behavior is
tantamount to having a team called the Popes, Bishops or Cardinals
dance around in their ceremonial robes and headwear, offering the
crowd Gatorade out of bejeweled chalices while serving Holy
Communion--all in an effort to score a touchdown. Get the picture?</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Florez Jr.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ricci's article was terrific. "A lot of wasted energy" is the
understatement of the year. He should also add, "A lot of wasted
money." According to Birmingham High's Web site, it has 0.4% Native
American students. If any other groups become offended (and there are
many ethnicities enrolled there), this could be an expensive
proposition to be "politically correct."</TE>
<TE>   As a student at Birmingham in the 1960s, we always considered a
Brave a person of great honor and bravery. Our mascot wasn't made fun
of, and the school spirit was as high as the achievements of the
students I went to school with. Next year we're having our 40th
reunion. When we meet and see old friends, we are going to remember
each other as Braves. That's something to be proud of.</TE>

<HD>What's Not to Like About Zucca?</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having dined recently at Zucca, I must take exception with S. Irene
Virbila's review ("Changing His Tune," Restaurants, July 7). Our
table had several appetizers and entrees, and other than a lamb shank
that felt a little tired, the food was both creative and beautifully
executed.</LD>
<LD>   My principal complaint with the review is that Virbila seemed to
dislike the restaurant mostly because it wasn't what she thought it
would be. It would be more helpful to readers if she would review the
restaurant she went to rather than the restaurant she envisioned. The
room is beautiful, the wine list imaginative, the service flawless,
the prices reasonable, and the food delicious. What's not to like?</LD>

<HD>A View From Echo Park</HD>
<DH>Della Rossa's Camera Gazes Lovingly on Latino L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABEL SALAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the photograph, Danny leans over the hood of his lowrider, his
young face suffused with pride. Posing next to an image of Christ
painted on the glossy metal surface under his chin, he appears to
hold back a slight smile. Jesus looks skyward with a face full of
pain. The young Echo Park man looks directly at the camera. Tattoos
peeking out from under the loose-fitting threads of a born and bred
pachuco, Danny is all youthful hope and handsome confidence.</LD>
<LD>   Della Rossa, 81, shot the photo at the subject's request. "He
walked across the street to ask me if I'd like to take a picture of
him with his car," she says. Two years later, Danny appears again in
a photo of a family celebration at his cousin's First Communion.
Standing behind her, the shirtless cholo looks away, his upturned
eyes glassy with a telltale numbness, testament to la vida loca, gang
life, in Echo Park. According to Rossa, who began photographing gang
families in Echo Park during the early '80s, Danny had already begun
the downward spiral into drug abuse and crime.</LD>
<TE>   The black-and-white photos, along with over 40 more taken during a
20-year period, were recently exhibited as part of a one-woman show
at the Perfect Exposure Gallery in L.A. The work follows the families
with uncanny intimacy. The mostly Mexican American kids seem to have
dropped the veil of hard detachment that often imbues similar
portraits. Rossa stays in touch with many of them, delivering copies
of the photos as gifts at holidays or on birthdays.</TE>
<TE>   A former print journalist who took up photography at age 60 during
a class at Pasadena City College, Rossa was fascinated by the gang
graffiti and the demographic transformation she witnessed in Echo
Park throughout the '60s and '70s. "I wanted a challenge, so I
suggested to my instructor that I photograph the entire length of
Sunset," recalls the artist.</TE>
<TE>   Rossa, who was raised in Fresno, lost her father to a sawmill
accident when she was 5. Only vague memories remain, she says, of the
Italian immigrant who gave her a surname and an aquiline nose. Reared
by her Irish mother, she made her way to San Francisco as a young
adult and later to New York, where she met the man she would marry.
They arrived in Los Angeles in 1957, settling in Echo Park four years
later. With her working-class sympathies and experience as a
journalist, Rossa often accepted freelance assignments, and though
not yet a trained photographer, she sometimes took the photos that
accompanied her stories. In August of 1970, for example, she covered
a protest march by the Chicano Moratorium Against the War in Vietnam
that erupted into violence between sheriff's officers and Chicano
civil rights activists in East L.A. Taken amid the clouds of tear
gas, her images of the melee appeared on the cover of the Los Angeles
Free Press and in the pages of the New York weekly the Militant, and
the series was later published in a limited-edition book titled "The
Day They Killed Ruben Salazar." A copy of the book is in the
Smithsonian's permanent collection. Another sits in L.A.'s central
branch library downtown. At her hilltop home with a view of downtown,
Rossa is modest about the scope and impact of her latest work,
discussing her subjects with a maternal affection. "I'm concerned
about them," Rossa says, adding that she has been treated with only
kindness and respect by the so-called gangbangers.</TE>
<TE>   On the coffee table in front of her is a more recent photo of
Danny. He is thick with prison yard muscles, his face etched with the
pockmarks of time, yet he has once again dispensed with the
gangster's stoic resolve. His gaze is tender, vulnerable even, and it
somehow defines the power and beauty of Rossa's photographs.</TE>

<HD>A Kinder, Gentler Palm</HD>
<DH>Better Service and a Relaxed Pace Mark This New Downtown
Steakhouse</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Couples lean toward each other, sharing bites of lobster or steak,
cosseted in dark walnut booths. In the middle of the room,
businessmen from downtown hotels, their shirt sleeves rolled up on a
fine summer night, sit at large round tables unwinding after a day on
the convention floor. At the horseshoe-shaped communal table in the
bar, lone diners have a swell time over steaks as they companionably
watch the current sporting event on the large-screen television.</LD>
<LD>   The new Palm boasts a prime location: right across from Staples
Center, in a grand edifice with soaring ceilings and gold-tipped
columns. Dark walnut shutters filter light at the windows, and huge
retro lamps hang from the ceiling. The walls, of course, are
plastered with the Palm's signature caricatures, though they're
rather incongruous in this elegant setting and spaced farther apart
than at any of the other Palms I've visited. (In all, the
family-owned restaurant chain has 26 locations. It was founded in
1926 by two Italian immigrants who intended to name it after their
hometown, Parma, but a clerk mangled the spelling and it came out
Palm.) I can make out Laker coach Phil Jackson, Dustin Hoffman, Tom
Cruise and L.A. Mayor James K. Hahn mixed in with reproductions of
the funny and irreverent caricatures by Jolly Bill Steinke, who first
started drawing them in the '30s.</LD>
<TE>   When the downtown Palm opened in April, recent visits to the Palm
in West Hollywood were still vivid enough that I didn't race out to
visit this one. I remembered waiting--and waiting--for a table long
after my reservation time had passed. I recalled the hostess who
didn't want to give my party of three a booth that seats four, so she
sat us at a booth for two, with the third person on a chair in the
middle of the aisle. Even the presence of a resplendent Mr. T at the
next booth wasn't enough to redeem that evening.</TE>
<TE>   I also remembered feeling hustled. The first courses came out
almost immediately, and we barely had time to catch our breath before
the main event was set down in front of us. Waiters did everything in
their power to turn the tables relentlessly. What they recommended
wasn't always to be trusted, either. The Palm seemed like just
another steakhouse where everything except the red meat was
lackluster.</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully, the new downtown restaurant is a kinder, gentler Palm.
The hosts are cordial and professional. Your table is ready on time.
Waiters are personable and professional. They also allow the guest to
give the cues. In several visits, I've never felt hurried along so
that another party could be seated. But then, it's never been as busy
as the West Hollywood branch.</TE>
<TE>   Even the food has a new luster. It's the same menu, but the crisp
professionalism of this kitchen makes all the difference. Shrimp in
the deconstructed shrimp cocktail are fresh-tasting and firm, nicely
chilled and paired with a brilliant red cocktail sauce with a
ripsnorting dose of horseradish. If you order oysters on the half
shell, they are crisp and briny.</TE>
<TE>   Like most steakhouses, the Palm is not given to understatement.
The lobsters, for example, start at three pounds. The market price is
about $20 a pound right now, but that 3-pound lobster is large enough
to serve as an appetizer for four, a sort of surf and turf in two
courses, if you follow it with steak.</TE>
<TE>   The lobster is a magnificent sight, lolling on the platter. And
the waiter prepares it for you. Breaking off the claws, one of which
looks as menacing as a boxing glove, he wraps them in a napkin and
cracks the shells with a deft twist of the wrist. The meat inside is
surprisingly tender. The legs are succulent and sweet, too. These are
lobsters from the cold waters off Nova Scotia. Dipped in drawn butter
and, if you like, a squeeze of lemon, it's quite a feast.</TE>
<TE>   Hearts of palm salad makes a refreshing first course, too.
Handsome glossy green hearts of palm without the usual tinned taste
are topped with chopped tomatoes, quartered hard-boiled eggs, black
olives and are dressed in a nicely tuned vinaigrette. Sliced tomato
and onion salad is a classic: just thick-sliced Maui onions and juicy
red beefsteak tomatoes drizzled with a bright vinegary dressing.
Along with that shrimp cocktail is another of lump crab meat that's
worth mentioning, too. Or you can split an order of the Palm's
broiled crab cakes, which are mostly crab and a touch underseasoned.</TE>
<TE>   Sides have to be ordered separately. I notice most people go with
the Palm's signature '''half &amp; half''--a mini-mountain half of fried
onions and half of cottage fries. The golden-crusted hash browns
aren't bad either, and who's to argue with a baked potato? Skip the
heavily creamed spinach in favor of sauteed leaf spinach. Fried
asparagus sounds like something worth trying, but what a bad idea.
Frying leaches out the flavor from the expensive, now brown, spears.
Green beans are a safer choice.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to beef, the Palm offers all the usual cuts, all
prime. The thick New York strip always satisfies. The house specialty
is the hefty double steak, 36 beautiful ounces of New York strip for
two to share. For flavor, I prefer the rib-eye on the bone over the
porterhouse. There is also filet. This one is butter tender, and as
thick as your fist.</TE>
<TE>   Order lamb chops and you get three double chops served the
old-fashioned way with mint jelly. Skip the jelly. The veal chop
passes muster, too. The beautiful thick-cut prime rib is marred only
by juices that have the metallic tang of canned bouillon.</TE>
<TE>   If anyone still has room for dessert after enjoying half of the
36-ounce New York strip, some sides and a first course, go with the
New York cheesecake. This is the real thing, flown in from S&amp;S bakery
in Brooklyn. It's tall and fine-textured, tasting properly of cheese
and not sugar. Take note, Cheesecake Factory.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, this new Palm is a welcome addition to the downtown
dining scene. When you can find decent appetizers and salads, a good
steak and competent service a block from Staples Center, it's just
one more sign that the downtown renaissance everybody has been
talking about for years may be inching closer.</TE>

<LD>INVITED TO: Sugar Ray Leonard presents boxing live from the Playboy
Mansion.</LD>
<LD>   TURN-ONS/TURNOFFS: "If you think about it, Playboy and boxing,
they both are very sexy," asserts presenter/promoter Sugar Ray
Leonard, celebrating the 25th anniversary of his professional entry
into the sport while staging his monthly ESPN2 fight club broadcast
at the mansion. "Something about a boxer is very sexy. I think this
is a perfect fit." Well, who's to argue? Folding garden chairs
suggest a summer wedding; the meaty cuisine, a barbecue; but the ring
is regulation, constructed a mere squawking distance from the aviary.
Host Hugh Hefner, wearing white slacks and a Playboy polyester shirt
loudly patterned with miniature magazine covers, moves in a sea of
blond. Jock stars and a small Hollywood contingent (hey, there's Dick
Van Patten) cavort with the numerous beach-party-clad Playmates, some
of whom giggle their way into the man-made pond. Berry Gordy roams
the grounds carrying a nine iron. "I'm trying to become a better
golfer, and whenever I have a chance, I do my practicing," the father
of Motown says. "Hef doesn't know it, but I dig up a lot of his
grass."</LD>
<TE>   IN THIS CORNER: "It's 'the mansion,' " says comedian D.L. Hughley.
"Even if they was having bingo, I'd be here." Despite the obvious
distractions, most present claim to be aficionados of the whole
Marquess of Queensberry thing, though few could name anyone on
today's lineup (flyweight, lightweight and a women's bout featuring
Jessica "Baby Doll" Rakozcy and generally mismatched opponents). "I
know a couple of the fighters because I've been training in their
gym," says "Ocean's Eleven" player Scott Caan. Ving Rhames,
underscoring his bond with pugilism (already established with his
Golden Globe-winning portrayal of tonsorially challenged promoter Don
King), sports a hat a la Sonny Liston, whom he portrays in an
upcoming biopic. (He also portrays a boxer convicted of rape--sound
familiar?--in the soon-to-be-released feature ''Undisputed,'' with
Wesley Snipes.) But what mere thespian can claim anything approaching
the cred of the man who sacrificed a lobe for the sport, Evander
Holyfield? "Boxing is what I do, and if I have spare time, that's
what I usually come to anyway," Holyfield says. "This is leisure. If
I was in training, I wouldn't be in L.A.'."</TE>

<LD>Three years ago, Eli Malol, a 27-year-old Encino real estate agent,
decided to start keeping kosher. Consequently, McDonald's, Carl's Jr.
and the rest of America's fast-food standbys were off limits. If
Malol wanted a burger, he would make it himself at home.</LD>
<LD>   Then several months ago, a friend called Malol from his car. Did
he know about the glatt kosher place at Ventura Boulevard and Woodman
in Sherman Oaks?</LD>
<LD>   Since then, Malol has been a regular at Orange Delite, which
resides in a former Orange Julius. He drives down from the eastern
end of Encino about four times a week, generally ordering the basic
$3.95 burger, but sometimes doing the pastrami burger. "It's a big
deal," he says, "because I love burgers."</LD>
<TE>   Shlomo Laniado, an Encino resident originally from Israel, opened
the stand last year after his daughter Brooke, then 17, came to him
complaining about the quality of food in kosher restaurants and the
fact, says Laniado, that there was "no [kosher] McDonald's-style
place where you can get a hamburger or McNuggets."</TE>
<TE>   "From the moment she said that, it clicked," adds Laniado, who
despite having no background in the food or restaurant business (he's
in construction) went forth.</TE>
<TE>   Laniado says Orange Delite's best source of advertising has been
rabbis. "They come to us, then go to the synagogue and say, 'You
gotta take the kids to this kosher place.' "</TE>
<TE>   Not that all of the customers are Jewish. To his surprise, Laniado
says, the ratio is about 50-50. Many customers don't even suspect
that Orange Delite is kosher until they walk through the doors and
see the Mashgiach, or kosher supervisor. "One of them looks like
Moses, with a 2-foot-long beard," says Laniado. "They look very
Jewish."</TE>
<TE>   The other giveaway is the absence of cheeseburgers. (The laws of
kashrut prohibit the pairing of meat and dairy.) "If somebody orders
a cheeseburger, we say we don't carry cheese," says Laniado. "The
first thing is shock. Then we explain that this is a kosher
restaurant. We lose a customer once in a while. But that's part of
the deal."</TE>

<LD>They don't talk about Old Pasadena for nothing. Old World
craftsmanship has been the watchword for more than 70 years at the
French Hand Laundry and Dry Cleaning, which enjoys a spotless
reputation among museum curators and studio costume departments as a
kind of luxury spa for heirloom linens and antique clothing.</LD>
<LD>   The business was founded in 1927 by Albert and Marie Cottave, a
French immigrant couple who brought with them traditional European
linen care techniques. At a time when household servants often
maintained everyday items, the Cottaves handled mainly specialty and
table linens using chemical-free hand methods that included water
softening and dry ironing. By 1970 Albert had died, and Marie sold
the business to Virginia McManigal, who had worked in an area
dry-cleaning shop for 20 years. McManigal brought modern dry-cleaning
technology to the laundry but continued to honor the house credo of
hand workmanship. In 1980 after an employee fell ill, McManigal's
daughter, Susan, pitched in to help and ended up staying on to run
the business.</LD>
<TE>   Along the way, Susan fell passionately in love with antique
textiles. The French Hand Laundry began to specialize in fine
restoration work on antique wedding gowns, christening dresses,
vintage clothing and movie costumes. Though she warns that not all
old pieces are salvageable, her loving ministrations often mend
fragile laces and restore dingy, age-browned heirloom pieces (some as
old as 200 years) to their original pristine white. She restored a
slip that Mary Pickford wore in a movie and the blouse Judy Garland
wore in "The Wizard of Oz."  It is not uncommon for a restoration of
an elaborate piece to take a year or more. "Fabric is a living
organism that tells a story," Susan says.</TE>
<TE>   The laundry does conventional cleaning too, but always with a nod
to tradition, hand-sewing buttons, blocking (hand-shaping) and
pressing on huge 50-plus-year-old machines. The McManigals mix their
own starch and iron tablecloths with a weighty iron that's also more
than half a century old</TE>
<TE>   "I've truly been blessed," Susan says, "I've been able to create a
business from a passion.</TE>

<DH>Tamco Is the Last Remaining Mill in California--a Point of
Pride and Fear for Every Employee.</DH>

<LD>At 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, steel has no memory. Bedsprings, oil
filters, baby carriages and coffee cans forget what they were, their
crystalline forms obliterated by the heat, puddling at once into an
atomized soup of carbon and iron and lime. Flames roil the surface.
Gases pour into space. It's a mixture straight from hell.</LD>
<LD>   ''OK, Pete: No carbon. Twenty-five. Two cans.'' John Minech talks
into his walkie-talkie. He's a melt shop supervisor, and he's asking
for 2,500 pounds of manganese and 20 pounds of vanadium to be added
to the brew. It's the first hour of the graveyard shift at Tamco
Steel in Rancho Cucamonga, a little before 11 on a Thursday night.
Minech steps out of the furnace pulpit, a small glassed-in room where
he directs operations, and heads down a flight of stairs to the
floor, where Richard Cooper and Pedro Delgado are working.</LD>
<TE>   Cooper--or Coop, as he's known to his crew--is dressed in a silver
flame-retardant suit, his copper-tinted face shield pulled up. He
stands aside as Minech walks to the tapping station, a small platform
protected by glass, and toggles a lever on the control panel. The
furnace, which sits 40 feet above the ground, starts to tilt, and 100
tons of molten steel pour, like tea from a kettle, into a ladle the
size of a deep and narrow swimming pool, suspended in space by an
overhead crane. Billows of gray gaseous smoke fill the interior. The
white-hot ribbon illuminates the darkened interior of the mill. It
splashes over the rim of the ladle in a million tiny drops
(''skeeters,'' they're called), cascading like sparks over the mill's
columns and concrete foundation. Nature itself can hardly rival such
beauty.</TE>
<TE>   It takes almost two minutes for the ladle to fill, and when it's
full, Minech heads back to the pulpit. The furnace rocks back, its
roof slides open and a claw bucket drops the next batch of scrap
inside the furnace.</TE>
<TE>   ''I love making steel, and I love making money,'' he announces.</TE>
<TE>   At 55, Minech has been working with steel since he was a kid 35
years ago, when U.S. Steel had a plant in Torrance. It's been a love
affair that has cost him two marriages. He's on his third and still
goes for the overtime. Which makes it all the more difficult to
imagine--especially after a moment like this, a moment so ingrained
in American life and culture--that one day it may all be gone. Tamco
is the last remaining mill in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Rising above the plains of San Bernardino County, Tamco Steel
seems rooted to its place by the sweat of the men--and the very few
women--who have worked here since 1957. The same could hardly be said
of its neighbors. Near a development of Victorian-style homes and a
shopping mall anchored by Wal-Mart, the plant is an anomaly in this
fledgling suburbia. Dusty, aged pines and oleanders line its drive
off Arrow Highway. The furnace house, eight stories high and as large
as a football field, dominates the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   It's almost midnight, and another batch of steel is ready to be
poured. Swarms of skeeters are soon flying, and a course of slag
brims over the top of the ladle. Watching it without tinted glasses
is like staring at the sun. Stand too close and it feels just as hot.
''You wanna run, but you can't,'' says Dave Kiel, a foreman at the
plant. He captures in a few words the allure of a place that seems to
have no beginning and no end, only an appetite for more production
and more work.</TE>
<TE>   Kiel is known as Killer, a nickname from his barfly days, although
it's a little misleading because he's a rather cherubic-looking
48-year-old. He has a nasty burn on his neck, though, caused by steel
spilling out of the tundish, a large tub. ''Like getting hit by
rocks,'' he says with a smile that's missing a tooth, ''and then
catching on fire.'' He takes a long drag of a Marlboro Menthol and
nods in the direction of the latest heat. ''Making steel,'' he says,
''is like trying to control a river.''</TE>
<TE>   Snow-white steam purls from the chimney into the night sky, barely
noticeable to the motorists heading north on Interstate 15,
Vegas-bound. In the yard, fat-wheeled dump trucks filled with scrap
metal dart across the blacktop, their reverse horns competing with
the drone of the furnace.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Cucamonga is a long way from the steel mills of Pittsburgh
and Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania but not so far from our own local
Rust Belt. Just down the street, in neighboring Fontana, Henry Kaiser
broke ground in 1942 on the region's largest steel mill, a plant that
dominated the West Coast war effort and, later, fueled the
development boom. A victim of global competition and poor management,
it shut down in 1983 and was torn down soon thereafter. Today it is
the site of the California Raceway.</TE>
<TE>   Tamco's status as the last mill in California is a point of pride
and fear for the men working here. Never mind that it's 50%
Japanese-owned. Cooper, a relief foreman with eight years of
experience and the son and grandson of two Tamco employees, talks
without apologies about wanting to leave what once was America's
future. ''I love my job,'' Coop says. ''I just don't think it's going to
be around much longer." Last year, Coop, 32, put in an application with
the state Department of Corrections.  He was looking to become a prison
guard.  More money, more benefits, more security.  He passed the physical
test, but was eventually turned down.</TE>
<TE>   It was a disappointment made all the more bitter by how tough
working at the mill has become lately. He grossed $53,000, almost
$8,000 less than the year before, which is quite a hit when put
against a $1,000 monthly mortgage for a home on the other side of the
Cajon Pass, $750 a month in child support and two car payments. But
Coop was lucky. Tamco laid off 80 workers, out of 350, in 2001. For
most it was a four-week hiatus as a new casting machine was
installed; for others it was longer as the company looked for ways to
save money.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of running an electric-arc furnace doubled from $1
million to more than $2 million a month last year, during the year of
the Great California Electrical Crisis. It's a running joke that once
the furnace gets going, the lights in the communities where Tamco
gets its power momentarily flicker.</TE>
<TE>   The roof of the furnace has closed over another load of scrap.
Three electrodes, looking like red-hot Popsicles, swing into place
and descend through holes in the roof. It's quiet, and then Robin
Gondeck, sitting in the pulpit, flips a switch on the control panel
and--bang-- the arcing begins. White light dances across the ceiling,
and flames begin leaping out of the edges of the furnace. The pulpit
shudders from the explosions of the scrap collapsing into itself.
''It's poetry in motion when everything is working,'' says Gondeck,
who's been at Tamco since 1979. He has worked in the steel industry
since getting out of Vietnam in 1970, where he was posted as a lance
corporal just above the DMZ.</TE>
<TE>   While the cost of electricity has put the squeeze on Tamco, the
company is not alone in its fight for survival. Between 1998 and
2001, nearly 30 steel mills in this country filed for bankruptcy.
It's a complex problem that's creating a situation comparable to the
early years of Reaganomics, when the term Rust Belt first took hold.
No wonder talk in the pulpit so easily shifts to politics.</TE>
<TE>   ''The government has turned its back on us,'' says Gondeck, who,
like most of the men at Tamco, is proud of what he does--steel from
Tamco helped built Staples Center and the Alameda Corridor--and
indignant that the work is so poorly understood. ''Steel is this
country's defense as much as oil is,'' he says. ''Yet no one in
Washington seems all too concerned about domestic steel production.''</TE>
<TE>   At least not until four months ago, when President Bush imposed
tariffs of as much as 30% on imported steel. Gondeck says the tariffs
will help. So far they've had no effect, but, like many steelworkers,
Gondeck is hoping for additional action that will secure the pension
and health-care plans of retired workers.</TE>
<TE>   But that discussion, once making the rounds in Washington, has
fallen silent.</TE>
<TE>   ''OK. Blast and cast.'' Minech signals his approval after
analyzing the composition of the latest batch. The crane lifts the
ladle to a resting station six stories above the floor of the mill. A
silicon and graphite plug at the bottom is blasted out of position,
and the steel pours into the tundish. From there five pencil- thin
streams drop into 5-inch-square molds where molten steel backs up
against the steel that's slowly solidifying in the spray chamber,
where jets of water--500 gallons a minute--cool and shape it.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, it emerges from the mill in a long, continuous orange
strand. In the yard, acetylene torches spark their way across the
surface, cutting the steel into ingots, 29 feet long, 1 ton net,
which are then taken to the rolling mill to be heated to 2,100
degrees and pushed through a machine that turns them into rebar, the
wiry skeleton inside concrete. It's a common refrain around here that
making rebar in the earthquake capital of the world is good business.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California was once one of the largest, most diversified
industrial centers in the world. But in the early 1970s, life
changed. Blame the Air Quality Management District, blame the cost of
doing business in the state, blame imports and the North American
Free Trade Agreement, but the lights in Los Angeles factories began
to go out. Minimum-wage positions replaced top-paying,
union-protected jobs, and slowly the middle class began to shrink. In
Los Angeles County alone, manufacturing jobs have fallen from nearly
1 million in 1979 to a little more than a half million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're a dying breed,'' Minech admits. Dying, he explains, on
account of foreign steel and NIMBYs who would rather kick steel mills
out of the country than deal with the problems and pollution they
cause. When it comes to Bush's tariffs, Minech is circumspect. He
knows for sure, however, how much it bothers him to find foreign
steel selling at Home Depot, something he checks out whenever he's in
the store.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, there's little time to consider such things. With
summer upon them and electricity still an expensive and capricious
commodity, the crews at Tamco are eager to work as many hours as
possible. It may be 100 degrees outside and more than 130 degrees
inside, but sweat and a little discomfort are a small price to pay
when the alternative is the idleness of a shutdown.</TE>

<LD>''Ladies, your heat has started.''</LD>
<LD>   At the quarterfinals of the OP Pro, a proving ground for
California surfers on the amateur circuit, Richard Langen is plunked
in a beach chair on the sand, his eyes fixed on the tattered waves.
Just off the Oceanside pier, four surfers bob on the water as the
Isley Brothers' ''Who's That Lady?'' floats over the loudspeaker. One
of those ladies--chestnut hair, freckles, Hotline wetsuit, yellow
jersey--is Langen's daughter Kyla. And so far the community college
student and national collegiate surf champion is acing the
competition.</LD>
<LD>   ''Last wave for yellow, 5.5,'' the announcer bellows.</LD>
<TE>   The conditions this morning are lousy; the surf is windblown and
small. One after another, the women take off only to see the waves
collapse into mush. Langen, an affable guy of 53 clad in a sweatshirt
and jeans, teaches the surfing class at Oceanside High. He's been
coming to contests like this since Kyla was 15 and ripping for
Carlsbad High's surf team. Even so, ''it's so nerve-racking for me
that I'm thinking about not going'' anymore to her competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Langen is the one who first pushed Kyla into the waves at the
age of 12, the one who saw that magical moment when she popped up and
he knew she was a natural. He encouraged her to compete, and when she
asked for surfboards for Christmas, he bought them. He still loves to
surf with his daughter, but things are different. Now his 20-year-old
baby chases the big waves in Hawaii. ''I'd never do that,'' he says.</TE>
<TE>   After a few dramatic moments when a fin suddenly snaps off her
board and she has to race to shore to grab another one, Kyla manages
to land first in the heat. She's made the semifinals. Langen grins,
but right now he's too busy to celebrate. He's hunched over in the
sand screwing a new fin in his daughter's board.</TE>
<TE>   Kyla's ascension as top surfer in the family is a sign of the
times. When she first started paddling out in the waters off the
coastal town of Carlsbad, she was usually the only girl out there.
Despite its veneer as the apogee of everything cool and
free-spirited, surfing was chiefly male terrain. Ian Cairns, founder
of the Assn. of Surfing Professionals, once described it in
less-than-flattering terms as a sport ''run by a lot of rad male
chauvinist pig dudes.''</TE>
<TE>   Well, pig dudes, welcome to the revolution.</TE>
<TE>   If you haven't set foot on a beach lately, you haven't seen the
revolution in women's surfing that's sweeping the California
shoreline. While no one can cite precise statistics, most observers
agree that of the roughly 1.5 million hard-core surfers in America,
about 10% to 20% are female and that women's surfing is growing
exponentially. ''I never thought I'd see so many girls in the water
in my life,'' says Jessica Trent Nichols, a marketing manager at
Billabong, the surfwear company that launched its girls' line only
three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of the revolution is everywhere. A few weeks ago, on an
overcast Sunday at Oceanside, I counted a half-dozen women and girls
in the water, including a surfer mom in a rash guard and board shorts
whose shaggy-haired husband played with their two small children on
the shore while she surfed. Five short summers ago, that scene would
have been rare. For many guys, who used to disdain the idea of
sharing their male-dominated turf with a female, it's actually cool
to have a girlfriend who surfs.</TE>
<TE>   Female surfers are also changing the marketplace. In the last two
years at least a dozen new surf schools with names such as Just
Sisters and HB Wahine have cropped up along the coast. The already
established schools are being flooded with students--from 7-year-old
boogie boarders to middle-age moms. Isabelle ''Izzy'' Tehayni, the
force behind Surf Diva, one of the best-known schools catering to
women and girls, has seen enrollment in her surf camps double every
year since 1996, when she founded the La Jolla school. This summer
she had to hire 15 more instructors just to keep up with demand. Mary
Hartmann, who has been running Swell Time Surf School in Dana Point
since 1987, used to get one or two girls in her surf camps in the
early '90s. This year the camps filled in a day, and of the 220 kids
who signed up, 210 were girls. The groms are also getting tinier. At
last fall's Roxy Wahine Classic, an amateur surf contest in San
Onofre where girls mingled with the female pros sponsored by Roxy,
the youngest competitor was 4.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Sunshine Makarow, then a member of the U.S. Surf
Team, took over the Web site Girls Surf Life because, as the
24-year-old put it, ''the guys tend to be so sexist.'' Response to
the site led to a print version that debuted in June. ''Blue Crush,''
a movie about the lives of competitive surfer girls is scheduled to
open Aug. 16. Female surfers are popping up in other media as well,
from Sheryl Crow's latest music video to American Express commercials
to E! Entertainment Television. Randy Hild, an executive with
Quiksilver, which launched the Roxy line for women and girls in the
early '90s, says that television ''is more interested in girls'
surfing than boys.</TE>
<TE>   ''How can you lose with girls in their bikinis out in the ocean?''</TE>
<TE>   Mary Setterholm is keenly aware of the ''bikini factor''; it's
precisely the kind of attitude she's been rebelling against for most
of her life. Setterholm, who grew up in a low-slung neighborhood near
Santa Monica, is a pioneer in women's surfing and won the women's
title in the U.S surfing championship in 1972 when she was 17.
Seeking to improve conditions in the sport, she and several other pro
surfers founded the Women's International Surfing Assn., an
organization that held female-only contests for 17 years. Now the
owner of Surf Academy in Manhattan Beach, the 47-year-old surfer has
her own theory about why girls are flocking to the sport: ''They're
being given permission. A lot of times what gives people permission
is the marketplace. We're aesthetically appealing for advertising, so
it's the thing to do.''</TE>
<TE>   The first signs that women and girls might invade the sport
started to emerge about 10 years ago. What kicked it off was the
performance of four-time world champion Lisa Andersen, considered the
most aggressive woman surfer of all time and one of the sport's first
female celebrities. The Florida native, who returned to the pro
circuit this year, achieved a milestone when Surfer magazine put her
on the cover of its February 1996 issue with the provocative caption:
''Lisa Andersen Surfs Better Than You.'' Andersen was only the second
female surfer in the magazine's history to be featured on the cover
(Santa Barbara's Margo Godfrey Oberg was the first) and, according to
Hild, ''it was a turning point'' in inspiring girls to take up the
sport. Another turning point was the resurgence of the longboard in
the early 1990s. Because they were lighter and floated better and
were easier to ride than their shorter counterparts, women who'd been
intimidated by surfing found an avenue into the physically daunting
sport. Then, in 1993, Roxy launched the now ubiquitous boardshort,
liberating girls from bikinis.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is going to sound really weird,'' says Janel Anello, a
former pro surfer who competed against Andersen in the late '80s,
''but one of the things that really pushed girls' surfing is girls'
swim trunks. It made the girls who weren't surfing aware of it. [They
said] 'Wow, these are cute. They're surf trunks? Surfing? What's that
about?' ''</TE>
<TE>   Even so, 10 years ago the surf industry still revolved around men,
and if a woman wanted a wetsuit tailored to her physique, she was
often out of luck. That inspired a few entrepreneurs to open the
first surf shops for girls and women, which in turn spurred the huge
growth of surf apparel lines for women. ''I was doing business before
the doors were even opened,'' recalls Hartmann, who launched Girl in
the Curl in Dana Point in 1997. Not that she didn't encounter a tide
of cynics. ''When I first opened, people were like, 'An all-girls
surf shop? I don't think so,' '' says the 41-year-old former
competitive surfer. ''There were times when I closed the door and
would cry.''</TE>
<TE>   Hartmann's shop also filled a need in the male-driven subculture
by giving women and girls a place to meet and feel safe. ''It's kind
of like girls rule, this is their little sanctuary,'' says Hartmann.
There's a strong sense of community among female surfers, and ''they
can come in and tell me about that great wave they had. You go into a
guys' surf shop and you're scared to talk to them. A lot of them feel
girls should be in a thong bikini on the beach.''</TE>
<TE>   Many of the best girls in the sport came out of a movement that
started in the late 1980s, when a group of surf-crazy adults in San
Diego brought competitive surfing to public schools. Today the
Interscholastic Surfing Federation has more than 1,500 students in
middle schools and high schools from Santa Cruz to San Diego, and
about 20% of its members are girls. ''When I first started my
involvement, most schools could not even put two girls in the
water,'' says Diane Steuer, the federation's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   ''I still remember my first day,'' says Tasia Jones. ''Once I got
it, I loved it.'' Tasia is 16, a longboarder on Carlsbad High's
championship surf team, and she is describing that blissful summer in
sixth grade when she first paddled out with her friends Natalie and
Amy. The teens are still surfing together, and when she recalls the
year they went surfing in Baja or the winter they were too broke to
buy wetsuits and surfed in the bone-cold water in their bathing suits
and rash guards, her voice grows animated.</TE>
<TE>   ''We grew up around the beach together, then we just grew to love
each other,'' she says. ''We get so hyper out in the water. It really
relaxes all the stress you have.''</TE>
<TE>   Jones doesn't exactly fit the surfer girl stereotype. For
starters, she's a brunet. And she's a devout Christian who prays
before contests (''You have to be a good role model for younger girls
because they're watching you.''). She respects her parents, doesn't
smoke or drink and, in a sport almost invariably linked with partying
and plentiful sex, laments how females are viewed in the larger
culture. ''It's irritating because people think if you're a girl
surfer, you're either a slut or a [lesbian],'' she says. ''That's not
how it is.''</TE>
<TE>   Like most surfer girls, Jones has always been athletic. By 8 she
was playing softball, and she competed until she broke her elbow
during a game in high school. By then she preferred surfing anyway.
Last summer she was the only girl selected for Carlsbad's surf team
at the National Scholastic Surfing Assn.'s national competition. She
has also attracted sponsors, which has boosted her surfing profile
and means that her parents don't have to pay for most of her surf
gear anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Carlsbad High seems to be a hotbed for up-and-coming women
surfers. Jones is following in the wake of alumna Julia Christian.
Now 20, Christian is touted as America's next hope for women's world
champion, a title now held by Australian Layne Beachley.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer Christian came in second in the U.S. Open of Surfing
at Huntington Beach, and she is currently ranked 14th on the World
Qualifying Series Tour, which feeds into the World Championship Tour.
And she doesn't intimidate easily. A few months ago, when she showed
up in Panama for the Billabong Pro, the women's event was cancelled
because there weren't enough entries. Christian entered the men's
shortboard event, and ''she beat out a lot of the guys,'' says
Nichols.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly surfing has had female legends: Joyce Hoffman in the
'60s, Jericho Poppler, Margo Godfrey Oberg and Hawaiian surfer Rell
Sunn in the '70s, Frieda Zamba in the '80s and, in the last decade,
Hawaii's Rochelle Ballard, one of only 17 women on the elite World
Championship Tour. But because surfing has long been considered male
territory, the sport has produced relatively few world-class women
surfers and only a handful who are American.</TE>
<TE>   As with many of the current generation of surfer girls, Christian
started in junior high because her two older brothers encouraged her.
''They'd surf and I'd tag along,'' she says. Surfing came easily, and
soon she was dragging her best friend, Amber Tisue, out in the waves
with her every day. She loved the freedom of the ocean and and
hanging out at the beach with her friends. ''It kept us out of
trouble,'' she says, giggling.</TE>
<TE>   As a top female pro, Christian travels to the Maldives and France
and other exotic venues on the world tour, but she hardly lives like
royalty. Her dad is a tile setter, her mom is in purchasing for the
Carlsbad School District, and Christian still lives with her parents
in their tiny two-bedroom bungalow a block from the beach in
Carlsbad. Until recently she even shared a room with her brothers.
She does chores at home, baby-sits, and sews her own clothes. Last
year she was thrilled because she'd just bought her first truck, a
2001 gold Ford Ranger, with money she'd saved from her prize
earnings.</TE>
<TE>   ''She is so deserving of sponsorship,'' says Nichols. ''She hasn't
had things handed to her on a silver platter.''</TE>
<TE>   An honors student in high school, Christian could have gone to a
number of colleges. But ''if I stopped surfing, I don't know what I'd
do.''</TE>
<TE>   If anyone has been an emissary for women's surfing, it's mary
Setterholm. After a journey that started in Santa Monica and spanned
marriage, five children and a divorce, she returned to the sport in
1998 when she founded Surf Academy. Known primarily for its women's
surf clinics and classes such as ''Wild Woman Workout,'' the school
is also geared to families.</TE>
<TE>   Setterholm rarely advertises, but she does publish a Web site that
includes a surf report (''Surf is small, hardly there, but fun if you
are a beginner and want to master taking off on an unbroken wave''),
contest results, a column called ''Mary's Soapbox'' and various news
items (''Surf Academy was on CNN across the country and around the
world on Friday. It is going to be a busy summer as CNN wants to do
this again real soon.'')</TE>
<TE>   On those few mornings when she's not training for a surf
competition or standing waist-deep in the surf cheering on a pod of
female students, Setterholm can sometimes be found on dry land,
recruiting women and girls. One hazy weekday morning she turns up at
Notre Dame Academy, a Catholic girls high school in West Los Angeles.
Setterholm has been invited to speak to the school's surf club by
Susie Conley, who taught for her the previous summer. She's brought
along tons of surf-related giveways for the girls, including
stickers, posters, T-shirts and her surfboard--which she props up
next to a statue of the Virgin Mary. Dressed in running shoes, a red
T-shirt with the logo ''Wild Woman Water Day'' on it, and black
tights, her thin blond hair stuffed in a ponytail, Setterholm looks
fitter than most 20-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   When the girls pour into the gym in their tan pleated skirts and
white shirts, chattering and lugging their backpacks, she greets them
effusively. ''Hi, guys! This is Surf Academy. It's all about women's
surfing!'' She's brought a video of ''Wild Woman Water Day,'' the
annual sporting event that consists of a variety of amateur swimming
and surfing contests. But before showing it to the two dozen or so
teens, she whips them up with a little history lesson and pep talk.</TE>
<TE>   ''How many of you surf?'' she asks. A half-dozen hands tentatively
go up. ''You guys know it's a happening thing to surf? I've been
surfing over 30 years.''</TE>
<TE>   ''Wow!'' a few girls murmur.</TE>
<TE>   Setterholm's audience is even more impressed by the video, a
series of quick-action images of girls and women charging into waves
or gliding on top of waves, hooting and cheering for each other. But
when Setterholm asks afterward how many of them want to surf, the
response is muted.</TE>
<TE>   Setterholm knows surfing isn't going to attract every girl and
that only a few of the young women she's met this morning will ever
fling themselves onto a board and paddle out, ever feel the thrill of
skidding down the face and across a fast-moving wave. For all its
glamour and sex appeal and current cultural chic, surfing is a tough
sport to learn. It takes years to master. But that's OK. Setterholm
knows there are plenty of girls out there ready to rip.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, she has seen her own numbers swell
radically. In May, Surf Academy became the official surf school for
the city of Santa Monica. She's already got 500 kids lined up for
summer camp there and another 600 at her Manhattan Beach site, twice
the number of groms she taught last year. More than 60 people are
working for her. In her first summer program four years ago, she
probably had 25 girls. Now she's receving more than 100 calls a day,
many from women and girls languishing in the landlocked Midwest.
''It's just gone through the roof,'' Setterholm says, sounding
amazed.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Surf Academy now runs the camps sponsored by industry
giant Quiksilver. Early last month, Setterholm was gearing up to run
a series of clinics called ''Roxy Surf, Now.'' Held at various
Southern California beaches, the clinics were aimed at the rising
wave of girls, ages 7 to 17--the very group that will shape the
future of the sport. To say the least, Mary Setterholm is stoked.</TE>

<LD>Here's a Caribbean deal that's especially good for families.
SuperClubs' all-inclusive Breezes resort on the island of Curacao,
off the Venezuelan coast, is offering rates of $94 per person per
night, double occupancy, for stays through Dec. 15--about 45% off its
usual lowest rates for the season. In addition, one child age 13 or
under per paying adult can stay for free through October; starting
Nov. 1 the per-child charge is $45 per night. Thus a family of four
can stay for $188 per night until Nov. 1. Rates include lodging,
food, liquor, sports, entertainment and gratuities. Air fare to
Curacao and some activities, such as spa treatments, golf and
excursions, are extra.</LD>

Sept. 30 and stay at least four nights. The deal is subject to
availability. (800) 467-8737, www.superclubs.com.</LD>

<HD>Wright Brothers' Centennial Events Set to Take Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The celebration is a year away, but ticket sales have already begun
for a festival in Dayton, Ohio, marking the centennial of the Wright
brothers' historic first manned flight in Kitty Hawk, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   The festival is among dozens of aviation events across the nation
in 2003 that will climax Dec. 17 with a planned re-creation of the
1903 flight in a reproduction of the original plane.</LD>
<LD>   Dayton, where Orville and Wilbur Wright lived and worked, will
offer an expanded version of its annual air show July 17 to 20. (It
usually lasts two days.) There will be more vintage aircraft and
possibly aerial stunt teams from foreign countries as well as the
U.S., said Madeline Iseli, executive director of the city's Inventing
Flight celebration. Related events are scheduled in Dayton throughout
July. Ticket packages, which include several events, are $66 for
adults, $47 for children age 12 and younger. (888) 359-2003, www
.inventingflight.com.</LD>
<TE>   Information on other centennial activities nationwide can be found
at the Internet site of the Centennial of Flight Commission, created
by Congress three years ago, www.centennialofflight.gov. Among key
events, by location:</TE>
<TE>   * Wright Brothers National Memorial, Kill Devil Hills, N.C.: The
highlight of a five-day First Flight Centennial Celebration Dec. 13
to 17, 2003, will be a reenactment Dec. 17 of the Wright brothers'
flight in a reproduction of their plane. A company in Warrenton, Va.,
commissioned by the Experimental Aircraft Assn., is building the
plane, using authentic materials and methods, including hand-carved
propellers, said Randal Dietrich, project director. Festival ticket
plans were pending as of last week, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   * Fayetteville, N.C.: An 11-day Festival of Flight May 16 to 26
will include hot-air balloons; an air show; flight demonstrations;
and exhibits from the Smithsonian, NASA and other organizations. A
highlight will be a 100-foot-long aerial kinetic sculpture
incorporating solar panels and other technology. Tickets were not yet
on sale.</TE>
<TE>   * Oshkosh, Wis.: The EAA's 51st annual fly-in here, known as the
EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, July 29 to Aug. 4, will include a
24,000-square-foot pavilion where participants can view the Wright
brothers' reproduction plane and use a flight simulator, among other
activities. No advance ticket sales are planned. Admission at the
door is expected to be $18 per day for EAA members, $29 for
nonmembers, a spokeswoman said.</TE>

<HD>Airline Suspends Service; Others Make Changes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been a busy two weeks in airline news. Among the changes:</LD>
<LD>   * Vanguard Airlines, a Kansas City, Mo.-based discount carrier,
suspended its flights and planned to seek bankruptcy protection after
the government rejected its request for a loan guarantee. Los Angeles
was among 18 cities it served. United and Frontier airlines said they
would offer Vanguard travelers lower fares by waiving
advance-purchase restrictions but would not honor the airline's
tickets.</LD>
<LD>   * Continental Airlines dropped a $40 round-trip fuel surcharge
from some ticket prices, then increased base fares on those routes in
the U.S. and to Canada by the same amount. The carrier said it was
trying to simplify pricing. Many airlines began adding the surcharge
two years ago to cover escalating fuel prices.</LD>
<TE>   * United Airlines added a $20 charge for issuing paper tickets on
routes in the U.S., U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico that are
eligible for electronic tickets. Most major airlines charge such a
fee. United also said it would stop issuing paper tickets within the
U.S. by July 2003 and for all locations by January 2004, after a
similar announcement in June by American Airlines. American plans to
end paper tickets by March for domestic trips and by December 2003
for all other trips.</TE>
<TE>   * Southwest Airlines has installed its first self-service check-in
kiosks at Dallas' Love Field airport and plans to add them to 12
other airports, including Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento, San
Jose and Oakland, by October. The move is part of increasing
automation for the discounter.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Hilton Hawaiian Village resort in Honolulu has closed rooms at
one of its new hotel towers after discovering mold.</LD>
<LD>   All 453 guest rooms at the Kalia Tower, which opened last year,
remained closed as of last week while Hilton investigated the cause
of the problem and developed a plan to solve it, a spokeswoman said.
A health spa, a cafe and the Bishop Museum in the tower remained
open. Kalia Tower guests were relocated to other areas of the resort,
which has about 3,000 rooms.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said one employee had reported a rash possibly caused by
the mold. The possible toxic effects of molds have recently become
controversial, with homeowners maintaining that molds in their homes
made them ill and seeking claims against their insurance.</LD>

<HD>Historic Western Rail Trip Opened to Public</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A unique train trip this month between Los Angeles and Williams,
Ariz., is being opened to the public by the National Railway
Historical Society.</LD>
<LD>   Al Richmond, historian for the Grand Canyon chapter of the
private, nonprofit group, said the train was originally a
members-only charter for transport to the annual convention in
Williams. But it was opened to nonmembers to help pay for escalating
liability insurance premiums, which Richmond attributed to post-Sept.
11 increases.</LD>
<LD>   One-way fares start at $370 per person coach, double occupancy,
plus a $50 registration fee; meals and hotel stays are included.</LD>
<TE>   The outbound trip from Los Angeles, Aug. 19 and 20 with one night
in Laughlin, Nev., uses a 75-year-old steam engine and 1940s and '50s
vintage cars. The return trip from Williams is Aug. 25 and 26 with
one night in Parker, Ariz., and includes the so-called Peavine
stretch from Ash Fork, Ariz., to Phoenix, usually traveled only by
freight trains, Richmond said. (928) 635-4960,

<LD>   "I can't believe I'm not throwing up right now."</LD>
<LD>   Luckily for us all, Ethan didn't lose his breakfast. But the "my
little brother almost hurled in a Humvee" tale will live on in our
family vacation lore.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, our recent weekend in Pismo Beach was a little goofy, but
that was the goal.</TE>
<TE>   In the hottest part of summer, we often peel out for kayaking in
Morro Bay or roasting marshmallows in Big Sur's campgrounds. This
year, with less time and a preteen who no longer finds molting
elephant seals fascinating, we chose a quick trip to the slightly
frowzy but fun area around Pismo Beach to check out the sand dunes
and a melodrama playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived on a Friday afternoon and checked into the Spyglass Inn
on Shell Beach, two miles south of downtown Pismo Beach. We paid
extra for an ocean-view room ($179.10 plus tax per night), which
opened onto a wide bluff-top garden dotted with benches and
landscaped with lavender, petunias and juniper hedges. Pelicans dove
into the kelp beds below. Later we spotted a sea lion and dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   After a swim in the tiny heated pool, the boys watched baseball in
the room while just steps away at the end of the terrace my husband,
Keith, and I sipped margaritas from the adjoining restaurant and
listened to a happy-hour jazz trio.</TE>
<TE>   Then cool gave way to cornball as we ventured out for dinner at a
cowboy restaurant, followed by a show at a Victorian-style melodrama.
A friend had recommended the nearby F.McLintocks Saloon &amp; Dining
House, which specializes in simple but tasty ranch-style cooking:
beef, ribs, salmon or chicken cooked over oak-pit flames.</TE>
<TE>   The food was ample and good, but the real highlight was watching
employees refill water glasses. Kids hold glasses atop their heads
while busboys clamber onto chairs, blindfold themselves with a dinner
napkin--and pour. Just enough ice water dribbles down necks and noses
to elicit whoops of laughter from nearby diners.</TE>
<TE>   Such high jinks were an ideal prelude to our evening at the Great
American Melodrama &amp; Vaudeville, three miles south of Pismo Beach in
Oceano, a little railroad town straddling Highway 1. As we drove
down, we tried to describe the over-the-top art of melodrama, whereby
damsels faint, heroes arrive in the nick of time and evildoers are
punished for dastardly deeds. Audience members are expected to boo
and hiss the villains and cheer the heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Adam thought the booing sounded kind of fun but was skeptical of
something that elevated overacting to an art form.</TE>
<TE>   We saw "Orphans of the Storm," which pits country damsels against
city thieves with a little "Oliver Twist" theme thrown in. Best of
all, the actors were talented, sang well and knew just when to tweak
the audience by tossing a conniving little smirk its way. Three of us
loved it. Adam, however, felt it was his adolescent duty to point out
the obvious.</TE>
<TE>   "This is corny. I mean really corny," the young critic opined.</TE>
<TE>   At intermission the costumed performers sold sandwiches, hot dogs,
beer, wine and soft drinks, all the while belting out little ditties
of appreciation whenever money landed in the tip jar. "She's a
Tipping Queen," sung to the tune of Abba's "Dancing Queen," was
weirdly hilarious.</TE>
<TE>   After the melodrama, the cast performed a campy vaudeville musical
revue spoofing the great American family vacation. Even Adam thought
that was a hoot.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday morning we ate an overpriced hotel breakfast before
driving over to Oceano Dunes State Vehicle Recreation Area for drama
of another sort, a Humvee tour of the area's sand dunes. Our personal
Lawrence of Arabia, Larry Haas, who owns the company that runs the
tours, met us in a rumbling green Humvee.</TE>
<TE>   We bounced along at a cautious pace on a beach where camping is
permitted. Haas chatted about fishing, the weather and the Humvee's
"large footprint," which allows it to claw up, down and over rugged
terrain. I was enjoying the ride and feeling pretty relaxed.</TE>
<TE>   Without warning, we cleared the slow zone and suddenly gunned up a
dune. At the crest, Haas turned the wheel, dropped into a "dune bowl"
and rounded it sideways. I felt as though I was riding a skittering,
out-of-control monster sand crab. We charged up another dune and
plunged down, roller-coaster style.</TE>
<TE>   Just before we reached the top of each dune, Haas paused. Logic
suggested he was checking for those little ATVs, or all-terrain
vehicles, that scuttle around the dunes like noisy bugs. But logic
lost out to the panic button flashing in my brain. I was sure we were
teetering on a precipice and were about to fall to our death.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, the boys in the back seat reacted to this adventure
with one smile and one white-lipped grimace. "I don't like roller
coasters, and this is just like a roller coaster," Ethan announced.
"Straight and fast is OK, though."</TE>
<TE>   Haas obligingly ratcheted down the thrill factor and, as the dunes
allowed, gave Ethan the little burst of speed he liked. The slower
pace still included some mild coasting and looping about. We climbed
the biggest dune, Independence Hill, for a view of vast, undulating
waves of sand. And we plowed through a narrow valley, the rest of the
world disappearing behind high sand walls.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Haas pointed out fenced-off parts of the dunes,
including the sensitive ground-nesting areas of the threatened
Western snowy plover as well as an ancient Chumash midden of castoff
clamshells. We were reminded that beyond the fences was an altogether
different side of the dunes.</TE>
<TE>   We wanted to glimpse that other side, so after the Humvee ride we
drove 20 minutes south to the Dunes Center in Guadalupe, run by a
nonprofit organization that promotes conservation of the
Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes, an 18-mile swath running between Vandenberg
Air Force Base and Oceano.</TE>
<TE>   Friendly docents guided us through the center, whose highlights
include a short (and roughly cut) documentary about efforts to
excavate the long-buried sets of director Cecil B. DeMille's 1923
version of "The Ten Commandments."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and off-roaders often clash over dune
preservation and recreational use. So it was with some trepidation
that I asked the docents about our morning romp on wavy hills that
took nature 18,000 years to build. They didn't even wince. The Dunes
Center is willing to live with careful joint use of the dunes. And
while off-roading isn't their cup of tea, they likened the Humvee
tours to a sort of dunes carpool.</TE>
<TE>   Hungry and lacking a picnic lunch, we decided to return in the
morning to hike out to nearby Oso Flaco, a wetlands lake wedged
between the dunes and the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   We drove back to downtown Pismo for lunch and a stroll. If ever
you need a tattoo, body piercing or a T-shirt that says, "Hold my
beer while I kiss your girlfriend," this is the place. You also can
find plenty of old-fashioned saltwater taffy, caramel apples and
great clam chowder. Nowadays, though, the clams are farmed: Pismo's
once legendary clam-digging beaches are nearly fished out.</TE>
<TE>   We filled up at the Splash Cafe, which took first place in the
Pismo Beach Clam Festival chowder cook-off. The cafe serves its
creamy soup in hollowed-out rounds of sourdough bread. Near the pier,
we rented bright yellow banana bikes for the boys to pedal along the
shore. No Humvee thrills, but fun nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning we awoke eager to see Oso Flaco, so we grabbed a
quick breakfast of terrific homemade cinnamon rolls and coffee cake
at Sea Side Cafe near our hotel. We reached the reserve along a
narrow farm road surrounded by pungent broccoli fields and were
greeted by a stately osprey sitting atop a pole in an irrigation
ditch.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as we left the parking lot at the trail head, we stepped
into another side of dune life. The Oso Flaco area is part of the
Oceano Dunes recreation area, but off-road vehicles are prohibited
here. The contrast is striking. The previous day we had gawked at the
motor homes, dogs, tents, horses, trucks and ATVs. Here we were
nearly alone. A trail lined with willow trees (and poison oak) led to
a long boardwalk built across the lake, away from the sensitive
dunes.</TE>
<TE>   A lone couple in a kayak plied the water. California least terns,
swallows and other shorebirds swooped overhead and darted under the
bridge. At the other side of the lake, the path continued. Even deep
into summer, the route was flanked by blooming silver lupine and
bright yellow evening primrose. Never missing an opportunity to flog
my children with history lessons, I suggested we pretend to be
Chumash trudging to the shore for a little clam fest.</TE>
<TE>   We reached a small rise that brought the steel-gray shoreline into
view. The landscape was austere but stunning. A fisherman cast his
line into the surf, and a pair of bird-watchers gazed at the dunes.</TE>
<TE>   We peered into the fenced area too, hoping to glimpse a snowy
plover, but our untrained eyes failed us. Oh, well. We had come
looking for fun, and we all had found some--each in our own way.</TE>

<HD>Rental Car Companies May Be Tracking You</HD>
<DH>GPS units mean you can run but you can't hide from some
auto companies, raising privacy and pocketbook issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Big Brother may be watching you in your rental car.</LD>
<LD>   Again.</LD>
<LD>   A flurry of lawsuits filed in the last few months claims a Budget
Rent a Car licensee in Tucson used satellite technology to track
renters who took cars out of state--and penalized them thousands of
dollars under a policy that charged $1 per mile if the car was taken
beyond the boundary. The suits allege invasion of privacy and fraud,
among other claims.</LD>
<TE>   In one case, company employees allegedly told a renter which
hotels he and his wife had stayed in, according to the couple's
attorney, Lynne Trenery of Tucson. The renter "was just shocked that
they knew the names," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The Budget licensee, Consolidated Enterprises Inc., has denied
most of the allegations in court filings; its attorney declined to
comment. The nationwide Budget Rent a Car company has tried to
distance itself from the licensee, saying it does not endorse
tracking renters or charging extra for going out of state. The
company's parent, Budget Group Inc., last week became the second
major car rental corporation in a year (ANC, parent of Alamo and
National, was first) to file for Chapter 11 reorganization. Budget
said it is continuing normal operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Tucson cases follow a notorious one last year in which a New
Haven, Conn., rental company allegedly used the same technology to
fine renters who drove faster than 79 mph. Earlier this year
Connecticut's consumer commissioner ordered the company to stop the
practice and refund the fines.</TE>
<TE>   The cases spotlight rental companies' embrace of telematics
technology, which includes using the Global Positioning System (GPS)
of satellites and wireless devices to transmit location data. A
popular use is on-board navigation systems that help direct drivers
to their destinations. But a lesser known and growing application by
rental companies is to track vehicles, which has troubling
implications for consumers.</TE>
<TE>   The company that made the devices used in New Haven and Tucson is
AirIQ, based in the Toronto suburb of Pickering.</TE>
<TE>   The AirIQ OnBoard system uses a small unit that is a combined
computer processor, GPS receiver and wireless transceiver. Using
signals from a system of 24 orbiting satellites, it calculates the
vehicle's position and transmits it to AirIQ's operations center in
Pickering, which can map it within seconds. Rental companies access
the data from the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Most of AirIQ's customers use the system to find stolen vehicles,
says Miguel Gonsalves, vice president of marketing. But it can do
many other things: monitor the car's speed, calculate mileage, notify
the owner when the car has crossed a state line or other boundary
and, by connecting to the car's operations, disable the starter and
even remotely open locked doors.</TE>
<TE>   Gonsalves declines to say how many units AirIQ has sold to rental
car companies. But he says it deals with most major ones and has sold
more than 25,000 units total to various types of customers.</TE>
<TE>   He also says he doesn't know how many rental car companies use the
system for matters other than theft control. "We can't as a business
dictate how things are used," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Budget Rent a Car spokeswoman Jennifer Sullivan says her company
has AirIQ units in some luxury vehicles and others with a high theft
rate. "We only use it for theft recovery, and the GPS is only turned
on when the vehicle is missing," she says of Budget's corporate-owned
outlets, which rent 80% of the fleet. She says she thinks most
licensees have the same policy.</TE>
<TE>   At Thrifty Car Rental, where Airl-Q is the "preferred supplier"
but outlets are free to install other GPS units, spokesman Jason
Logan says the system is in limited use in higher-end vehicles and in
bigger cities, mainly for theft control. "In some cities it is used
for enforcement of boundaries," he says, when, for instance, the
insurer may restrict liability in certain states or different laws
may apply.</TE>
<TE>   Avis has a different GPS-based system, GM's OnStar, in about
10,000 vehicles, or about 5% of its fleet, mostly luxury cars, says
spokesman Ted Deutsch. The renter can turn it on with a button to get
directions from a live operator or emergency assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Working with police, Avis turns on the system only if the car
appears to have been stolen, Deutsch says. The system will also
automatically activate if the air bag inflates, indicating a possible
accident. In that event, Deutsch says, you may hear a voice through
your radio ask, "Are you OK? Are you all right?" The system indicates
your location for emergency aid.</TE>
<TE>   This is a case in which a rental car's GPS unit could save your
life. It could also rescue your vacation by quickly finding your car
if it's stolen or spare you a service call if you lock your keys
inside. A Canadian financial writer reported calling the rental
company to get the locks opened remotely.</TE>
<TE>   But the privacy and disclosure issues involved in tracking
renters' speed and location are troubling.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the Tucson cases, plaintiff Alfred Schafer claims he
told the Consolidated Enterprises outlet when he rented an SUV in
March that he was going to Florida and back and that he thought that
was permitted. When he arrived in Florida, he says, he found his
credit card was exhausted by nearly $3,800 in penalties assessed by
the rental company for taking the car out of state without written
approval. He claims he later was billed for $3,512 more--all based on
tracking of his movements by a GPS system. In court filings, the
company disputes his version of events.</TE>
<TE>   Of the general issues raised by the Tucson and New Haven cases,
David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information
Center in Washington, D.C., says, "The problem is we currently have
no federal law related to collection of location information." The
uses of such information are impossible to predict, from companies
trying to target advertising, to divorce litigants hoping to catch
cheating spouses, he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Donald E. Simmonds, president and chief executive officer of
AirIQ, has a different vision of the new technology. In his company's
2001 annual report, he writes, "Ultimately, all of us as consumers
will embrace telematics as a vital part of our lives.... It will be
hard to be without the peace of mind and security that comes from
knowing a loved one's vehicle can report its location automatically
in the event of an accident!"</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure which vision is correct. But to the usual inquiries
about mileage charges, insurance and drop-off procedures, you may
want to add: Is there a GPS unit on board?</TE>

<DL>SNOWDONIA NATIONAL PARK, Wales</DL>
<LD>The Welsh mountain fog mesmerized me with its surreal beauty,
whipping over the craggy peaks and ridgelines, riding the constant
winds that sculpt the bleak rock face of the mountains.</LD>
<LD>   But it is more than the constantly shifting fog that shrouds
Snowdonia in mystery. Its very name evokes images of the fairy-tale
castles and legends that inhabit the lush landscape of northwest
Wales, the home of Snowdon, the tallest peak here or in England. The
legendary King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table are said to
have fought their last battle on the saddle of a ridge of Lliwedd, a
peak near Snowdon, and Arthur's sword Excalibur is supposed to have
risen magically from the waters of Glaslyn, a lake at the base of
Lliwedd. Legend has it that the knights are buried in a slanting
gully on the face of Lliwedd, where they await Arthur's return.</LD>
<LD>   At 838 square miles, Snowdonia National Park, which draws 6
million visitors a year, is the second-largest national park in
England and Wales. Unlike other "wild" national parks elsewhere in
the world, this one has residents--about 26,000 of them--surrounded
by emerald green peaks, lakes and waterfalls.</LD>
<TE>   It was not an ancient myth or glorious scenery I was seeking when
I came in April, but insight into another legend nurtured in these
hills. Since the early 19th century, these craggy peaks and rock
faces have been a training ground for some of the world's most
renowned mountaineers. I came here to learn more about George
Mallory, who may or may not have been the first person to climb Mt.
Everest.</TE>
<TE>   Before he made his name as a legendary mountain climber, Mallory
was closely associated with the Bloomsbury group, the bohemian
intellectuals of London known as much for their artistic and
intellectual achievements as for their varied and creative sexual
entanglements. He knew many of them from his college days at
Cambridge and continued his friendships after graduation. A wistful
picture of a shirtless young Mallory, which hangs in the National
Portrait Gallery in London, is one of many Mallory portraits painted
or photographed by Bloomsbury artist Duncan Grant. He captures on
canvas Mallory's grace and beauty, admired by men and women. "Mon
Dieu! George Mallory! the body of an athlete by Praxiteles, and a
face--oh incredible--the mystery of Botticelli," Bloomsbury writer
Lytton Strachey proclaimed breathlessly.</TE>
<TE>   I first saw that Mallory picture at the portrait gallery three
years ago and became fascinated by this man whose life existed at the
juncture of art and adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the stack of books I had read, I was still having
difficulty understanding his ultimately fatal attraction to
mountains. Nearly every biography mentioned the important role his
visits to Snowdonia played, so I decided a visit might give me
insight into him. It certainly made more sense than trying to climb
Everest.</TE>
<TE>   One need not be a mountain climber to explore parts of Snowdonia.
There are several roads that cross the mountains, permitting easy
access to trail heads. For the price of a short walk, you can enjoy
stunning views of mountain peaks, waterfalls and lakes. In season,
you can even take a train to the summit of Snowdon.</TE>
<TE>   I was determined, however, to experience Snowdonia in as
Mallory-like a manner as possible, despite a lack of mountain
climbing experience. On the Internet I came across High Trek
Snowdonia, a mountain-climbers' bed-and-breakfast at the base of
Snowdon. This mid-19th century stone farmhouse is named Tal y Waen,
Welsh for "top of the rough pasture." Husband-and-wife team Mandy and
Ian Whitehead live in the cottage next door and lead groups and
individuals on organized treks and climbing expeditions.</TE>
<TE>   I made my reservation for one of their "Welsh 3000s" long
weekends, during which I was scheduled to climb 14 of the
3,000-footers in three days.</TE>
<TE>   Mandy picked me up at the Bangor train station after my four-hour
journey from London. After we exchanged pleasantries, I asked how
many others were scheduled for the weekend's trek. "Well," Mandy
said, "none, actually. We forgot that you were coming, and there
weren't enough others, so we canceled the weekend."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing makes the heart sink faster than traveling 5,500 miles for
a canceled adventure. Mandy, however, had everything in hand and had
booked private guides for my first two days; Ian would lead me on the
third. My long journey was salvaged.</TE>
<TE>   After Mandy's hearty home-cooked dinner of Welsh lamb and nut
loaf, I retired to one of the three bedrooms on the second floor. It
had a double bed and a view of the hills rolling gently green down to
the sea. The two other rooms, both empty, were equipped with bunk
beds.</TE>
<TE>   "Hearty," I discovered the next morning, is the theme for all
meals at Tal y Waen. After a breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausage,
cereal, fruit, juice, toast and coffee, I felt fueled up enough to
conquer all 14 peaks in one day.</TE>
<TE>   Mandy equipped me with an anorak--a big, hooded raincoat--rain
pants, a large day pack, compass, hat, plastic-encased map, gloves,
water bottle and a packed lunch filled with chocolates, sandwiches
and other high-energy foods. I felt outfitted to climb Everest itself
and was certain all the gear was overkill. These were, after all,
only 3,000-foot peaks. How tough could a few little 3,000-foot peaks
be?</TE>
<TE>   Days before I arrived, Snowdon had received a fresh sprinkling of
spring snow, living up to its name. High winds and mountain fog were
predicted that first day.</TE>
<TE>   Mandy drove Geraldine Westrup, my guide, and me to the trail head
at a lake named Llyn Ogwen, at a little less than 1,000 feet. We
gathered our gear and began our day on an up note--practically
straight up.</TE>
<TE>   Geraldine motioned to the scrapes carved into the rock on the
scramble up Pen yr Ole Wen, our first peak of the day. "That may be
one of his crampon marks," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She was teasing, knowing I was curious about Mallory, though he
could very well have made the marks.</TE>
<TE>   George Leigh Mallory was born in 1886 in Cheshire, England, to a
local parson. He studied history at Magdalene College in Cambridge,
where he was introduced to the Bloomsbury crowd. He became a teacher
at Charterhouse School in 1910, married Ruth Turner in 1914 and
served as a gunner in World War I.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why he wanted to climb Everest, Mallory is said to have
replied, "Because it is there." He participated in expeditions to Mt.
Everest in 1921 and '22, both unsuccessful. He made his third attempt
in 1924, probably his last chance to claim the summit before time and
age caught up with him. On June 8, just 10 days shy of his 38th
birthday, Mallory and his climbing companion, 23-year-old Andrew
"Sandy" Irvine, disappeared into the mists of Everest.</TE>
<TE>   Mallory's body lay undisturbed until 1999, when a team found him
at the bottom of a long slope on the flank of Everest, 800 feet from
the summit. Irvine's body has never been found. Theirs is one of the
greatest mysteries of modern adventure. No one knows, even after all
this time, whether they reached the summit. If they did, they were
the first, not Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, who are credited
with the feat in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   And now I was following Mallory's footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   Geraldine and I reached the top of Pen yr Ole Wen, at 3,208 feet
the first of my Welsh 3,000-foot peaks. Our ascent was steep, gaining
more than 2,200 feet in a little more than a mile.</TE>
<TE>   We took a brief break for tea and then headed about a half-mile
along the ridgeline to Carnedd Dafydd, at 3,425 feet the next of the
six peaks we were to conquer this day.</TE>
<TE>   Geraldine pointed into the thick fog toward our third peak. I had
to take her word that it was there. She claimed that on a clear day
the views are spectacular, which I also had to take on faith. We
broke for lunch on the leeward side of Yr Elen, a 3,156-foot peak off
the main ridgeline. Though slightly protected by the mountain,
Geraldine and I chased plastic sandwich wrap as the wind tore it from
our hands.</TE>
<TE>   We scrambled back across the side of Yr Elen to the main ridgeline
and stamped our boots on the three remaining peaks for that day. By
the time we reached Foel-Fras (3,090 feet), our last peak, we were
ready for one more tea and chocolate break before beginning our
descent.</TE>
<TE>   "I can get nearly anyone up these mountains," Mandy had told me.
"It's coming back down that is the problem."</TE>
<TE>   She was, unfortunately, more prescient than I could have imagined.</TE>
<TE>   A small stone and log shelter provided us a resting spot out of
the fog and wind. The low carved stones arranged inside the shelter
forced our knees to our chins as we nibbled the few remaining snacks
in our sacks. After the break, my knees--one of them temperamental
and the other just sympathetic--had stiffened. As we started down a
slight incline, a sharp pain stopped me in my tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you OK?" Geraldine asked. "Fine, just a little stiff, I
think," I said, determined to walk it off.</TE>
<TE>   Despite my manly resolve, my knee protested vigorously as we
descended. I was diverted momentarily by a small herd of wild Welsh
ponies, looking magnificent in their winter coats, but by the time we
reached the bottom, the last eight Welsh 3,000s looked like a
remote--very remote--possibility.</TE>
<TE>   I spent the next day curled up in front of a glowing coal fire,
resting my knee and indulging myself with books containing references
to Mallory that Ian found for me in the Tal y Waen library.</TE>
<TE>   My knee was feeling better by Day 3, so Ian and I geared up for
our ascent of Snowdon, a lofty 3,560 feet. We parked the van near the
Pen y Pass hotel, a regular haunt of Mallory's that is now a youth
hostel.</TE>
<TE>   We climbed up the PYG Track, which derives its name from the Pen y
Gwryd (or PYG) hotel, where I would be staying that night. Mallory
had stayed there in 1914 with his new bride, Ruth.</TE>
<TE>   There was still snow on the ground at Snowdon's summit. We made
our way around the back of a still-closed restaurant to the "sun"
deck, where, in a wind tunnel of swirling mist and rain, we huddled
over our lunch.</TE>
<TE>   On the hike down we passed Glaslyn, the lake where Excalibur is
said to have appeared, now a deep green from decades of runoff from
the closed copper mines on its banks. Lliwedd rises above the lake,
though any hints of Arthur and his knights were shrouded in the fog.</TE>
<TE>   A tall, lean man caught up with us, and we struck up a
conversation. He was Geoffrey Pocock, an avid walker and author, who
was also spending that night at the Pen y Gwryd hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, I hope you are ready for a very eccentric stay," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pen y Gwryd, a trove of British mountaineering lore and of
old-time British hotel keeping, gives a guest the feeling of staying
with a slightly eccentric, set-in-her-ways aunt. Built in the
mid-19th century to provide accommodations for the growing number of
Victorian tourists coming to explore the mountains of Snowdonia, the
Pen y Gwryd has hosted numerous mountaineering greats, including
Hillary and Norgay. The practice run that led to their successful
assault on Everest was staged from this hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The ceiling of the public bar boasts a collection of signatures of
mountaineers who have stayed at the Pen y Gwryd--Hillary, Norgay and
Noel Odell, a member of Mallory's 1924 expedition to Everest. Odell
caught a glimpse of Mallory and Irvine through a momentary clearing
in the clouds sometime just after noon on the day they disappeared
and was the last person to see them alive. (The tradition of signing
the ceiling was only begun in the mid-20th century, so Mallory's
signature is absent.) Non-climbers have signed too, notably actor
Anthony Hopkins and Bloomsbury member Bertrand Russell.</TE>
<TE>   The rooms are comfortable and clean, if a little worn, and are
named after nearby peaks. Mine was Yr Elen. It had a sink and mirror
but no shower or bathtub. The toilet, I discovered after much
searching, was hidden in a small closet at the end of a dark hallway.</TE>
<TE>   Tucked away behind the reception desk/bar is the "resident's bar,"
a dark, wood-paneled room open only to hotel guests. On one wall is a
locked and alarmed display cabinet with memorabilia from the Hillary
and Norgay ascent of Everest: a shank of rope that tied the two
together at the top, plus various oxygen canisters, crampons, other
climbing paraphernalia from the expedition and, inexplicably, a
shrunken head from Peru.</TE>
<TE>   Eccentric indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Five of us were staying at the hotel that night. Dinner was
announced by the ringing of a large brass gong. I was about to
suggest to Pocock that we sit together in the large, nearly empty
dining room when he was shuffled to his table at one end of the room
and I was led to mine, near a window on the other side of the room.
Not wishing to upset tradition, I sat quietly alone at my table, as
did the other guests.</TE>
<TE>   The five-course meal, served on PYG (Pen y Gwryd) china and
antique silver, began with asparagus wrapped in ham and continued
with a delicious lentil soup. I chose the lamb chops for my main
course; they were exquisite. They were served with new potatoes,
zucchini, carrots and cabbage. For dessert I had homemade rhubarb pie
and custard. When the cheese cart was brought around, I couldn't
resist a small glass of port and some of the local cheeses.</TE>
<TE>   I then sat at my table not knowing whether I needed to await the
gong to be dismissed. Geoffrey was the first to rise, providing me my
cue to do the same. "I told you it was eccentric," he whispered.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning a cab arrived at the Pen y Gwryd to take me to
the Bangor train station for my return to London. We drove down
through the mountains and toward the sea, past ancient castles and
open slate mines. The fog lifted and the sun began to shine.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this the summit, crowning the day?" Mallory wrote. "How cool
and quiet! We're not exultant, but delighted, joyful; soberly
astonished. Have we vanquished an enemy? None but ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   The buttresses and domes that inspired Mallory rose above the
sheep-dotted green pastures, as timeless as legend and as beautiful
as any painting. I had walked in Mallory's steps and touched that
beauty, though the key to the mystery of his life may be forever
hidden deep within the mountains.</TE>

<DH>Actors in the HBO series 'The Wire' spent time with their
law enforcement counterparts to get a feel for Baltimore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two days after winning the pivotal role of an ambitious Baltimore
homicide detective in HBO's summer series "The Wire," British actor
Dominic West found himself riding on the mean streets of the Maryland
metropolis in a squad car with real homicide detectives.</LD>
<LD>   "I rode along with the police a good two or three weeks before we
shot the pilot," recalls West, who plays Det. James McNulty in the
gritty series that premiered to strong reviews on June 2. "One time,
I was in the back of the police car with a detective in the front
seat and a convicted murderer in the back seat next to me. I am
sitting there desperately trying to make light that this is an
ordinary day for me. He was really a sweet man but a crack addict. He
was accused of smothering an old woman and stealing her money. When
we got out of the car, I said to the detective, 'He's clearly
innocent.' But the detective said they found fragments of his sock in
her mouth!"</LD>
<LD>   On another ride-along, West found himself in the trauma unit of a
hospital "with a guy who had been shot eight times--four times in the
head. He was still alive. I was there with the relatives. You feel
like a terrible impostor."</LD>
<TE>   The police, though, welcomed the cast and crew. "The police sort
of like the TV thing," West says. "That surprised me a lot. I am not
sure it would be the same in England."</TE>
<TE>   "The Wire," which wraps its season Sept. 8, was created by writer
and executive producer David Simon, a former Baltimore-based
journalist who wrote about crime and drugs and was executive producer
of the Emmy Award-winning HBO miniseries "The Corner." Simon wrote
the story of "The Wire" with Edward Burns, a retired Baltimore
homicide detective and city schoolteacher.</TE>
<TE>   The 13-episode series tells the story of a single drugs-and-murder
investigation as seen through the eyes of both the police and their
targets.</TE>
<TE>   "The series sort of mirrors the two worlds," West explains. "They
are essentially two corporations. One is slightly more efficient than
the other. And it shows all the frustrations of being a foot soldier
in a massive corporate structure."</TE>
<TE>   The large ensemble cast also includes Sonja Sohn as McNulty's ally
on the investigation, narcotics Det. Shakima Greggs, and Larry
Gilliard Jr. as Angelo, a mid-level drug dealer with a conscience who
beat a murder rap with the help of his ruthless uncle (Wood Harris).</TE>
<TE>   Sohn says it's been a challenge to play her tough, no-nonsense
character. "She appears to be one way when you see her at work," she
says. "She's portrayed being this strong, assertive, committed
person, but you see a different side of her when she goes home and is
with her girlfriend."</TE>
<TE>   Like West, she rode along with her real-life counterparts. "The
few days I rode with the narcotics detectives, their female detective
happened to be out on leave, so I got a lot of my information from
those male detectives and also from Ed Burns and David Simon. I had
to learn how to be familiar with a gun."</TE>
<TE>   The series shoots on location in the projects of west Baltimore,
only about six blocks from where Gilliard grew up. "I lived in
Baltimore for 10 years and then moved to New York to go to college,"
says the actor. "My mother still lives there."</TE>
<TE>   He credits her with keeping him away from the drugs and violence
that surrounded them. "My mother managed to keep me sheltered from
all of that, but the neighborhood wasn't as bad then as it is now.
Now you walk through the neighborhoods of west Baltimore and east
Baltimore, and entire neighborhoods are wiped out. It's like some
Middle Eastern country. All the row houses are abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   "I can remember when all the neighborhoods were full of life. It's
a little bit scarier now, and it hurts a little bit now to see the
city in that condition."</TE>
<TE>   "The Wire" can be seen Sundays at 10 p.m. on HBO. The network has
rated it TV-MA-V,L (may be unsuitable for children younger than 17,
with advisories for violence and language).</TE>

<LD>Except trips to see fall foliage, travel slows down almost everywhere
in America in the weeks after Labor Day. Here are some good values
for a short vacation in September and October and one for the winter,
beginning in December:</LD>
<LD>   * A quick trip to Las Vegas: You can enjoy round-trip air and two
hotel nights in Sin City at budget prices, departing from almost
anywhere, if you purchase the arrangements from America West
Vacations or Southwest Airlines Vacations. A price war rages between
these two cut-rate carriers. Each offers packages for a two-night
stay, including midweek round-trip air fare, for less than $200 per
person from Los Angeles or Orange County airports and for $250 to
$350 per person from cities two to four hours away by air, using
large hotels like Fitzgerald's Holiday Inn. Extra nights can be
purchased. For a price quote, call America West Vacations, (800)
356-6611, www.americawestvacations.com, and Southwest Airlines
Vacations, (800) 423-5683, www.swavacations.com. Be sure to phone
both before committing yourself.</LD>
<TE>   * The Rockies in late summer or early fall: Aspen, Colo., that
favorite of the jet set, turns to bargain pricing in the slow autumn
months. (Summer, by contrast, is busy.) From Oct. 1 to Nov. 20,
round-trip air from Los Angeles and seven nights at a hotel in Aspen
or Snowmass cost as little as $520 per person, double occupancy.
Contact Aspen Reservations at (888) 649-5982 or at www.stayaspen.com.
Vail offers similar deals; get details at (800) 525-3875 or
www.visitvailvalley.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Lodgings at the Grand Canyon: Here you'll have to wait until
December for the biggest bargains. The South Rim offers
accommodations year-round. From Dec. 1 to mid-March, the company
managing the park's lodgings offers double rooms at Maswik and
Yavapai lodges, usually ranging from $79 to $121, for $66 (plus $9
per third or fourth person in the room, free if younger than 16). One
way to get there: Fly into Flagstaff, Ariz., and rent a car or take a
bus ($34 round trip). For booking and information, call (303)
297-2757, www.xanterra.com.</TE>
<TE>   * A week in Mouseland: If you plan to visit Orlando, Fla.,
especially if you're traveling with a family or small group, why not
rent a house with front and back yards and a swimming pool? For a
three-bedroom, two-bath house that can sleep up to eight, prices in
the fall range from $99 to $129 per night. Two options: Resort Quest
International, (877) 588-5800, www.resortquest.com, or Holiday Homes
of Orlando, (800) 288-2187 www.holidayhomesorlando.com.</TE>
<TE>   * A South Beach steal: Just alongside the exciting, trendy Art
Deco district of Miami's South Beach, where rates can soar beyond
$200 a night, stands the 77-year-old Spanish-style Clay Hotel, (800)
379-2529, www.clayhotel.com, a charming symphony in pink stucco on
Washington Avenue and Espanola Way. It has some inexpensive hostel
lodgings and some hotel rooms, many of which are fully outfitted with
air-conditioning, refrigerators and cable TV. Rates are $16 to $18
for dorm beds, $42 to $56 for singles and $62 to $70 for doubles.</TE>

<HD>Tracing Tales of Heroism in the Auvergne</HD>

<DL>LE CHAMBON-SUR-LIGNON, France</DL>
<LD>The best road trip has a purpose, a goal. Head for the beach just to
bask in the sun and the memory will fade faster than your tan. Make
it a pilgrimage and you'll never forget it. I'm not suggesting you
don a hair shirt. You'll have no quarrel with me about enjoying the
scenery, sleeping in a warm bed, eating pastries by the roadside or
savoring a good meal or glass of wine along the way.</LD>
<LD>   Sept. 11 illustrated that it is far easier to take a life than to
save one. Shortly afterward and by coincidence, I had scheduled a
four-day driving trip to a place in France that represents the
triumph of virtue and courage over cruelty: Le-Chambon-sur-Lignon, a
Protestant village in the Auvergne region of central France whose
residents saved the lives of about 5,000 Jewish refugees during World
War II. On my return trip, I would visit another village,
Oradour-sur-Glane, which suffered the destruction that Le Chambon was
spared. Being Jewish and having relatives who perished in the
Holocaust, I wanted to satisfy my curiosity and pay my respects to
these places.</LD>
<LD>   There are few countries better for a road trip than France. It has
a rich history, lovely scenery, excellent food and adequate plumbing.
And French roads are good--better than the drivers.</LD>
<TE>   As I left Paris, the overcast sky seemed fitting; I was jet-lagged
and in no frame of mind to enjoy the drive. I managed about 200
miles--almost to Beaune--before hitting the wall. Too tired even to
pull into a town, I stopped at one of the many U.S.-style motels at
an expressway plaza. No charm, but on that night I wasn't fussy and
just wanted sleep.</TE>
<TE>   My mood the next morning was sunny, even if the weather wasn't.
Continuing 60 more miles through Lyon, I drove along the Rhone River,
then southwest to the former coal-mining center of St. Etienne. I
kept an eye out for the E-88 to the small town of Firminy to the
south, where I found the tiny D-500 and followed it south into the
Haute-Loire, one of four regions, along with Allier, Puy-de-Dome and
Cantal, that constitute the unofficial boundaries of the Auvergne.</TE>
<TE>   Long before I first visited the Auvergne or heard of Le
Chambon-sur-Lignon I entertained a romantic vision of this isolated
region in France's Massif Central, settled about 2,500 years ago by
the Celtic Arverni. It was a fantasy nurtured by the haunting "Songs
of the Auvergne," collected and orchestrated by the French composer
Joseph Canteloube. Reality wasn't too far off the mark. I found
myself in a land of rolling hills connected by pastureland,
punctuated by thick forests. From Montfaucon the D-23 climbs to about
3,000 feet through the hills, forests and pastures of "La France
Profonde" to Tence and then a few miles farther to Le
Chambon-sur-Lignon. This is rustic, rugged country, home to sheep,
horses and cattle. This also is a land of about 100 extinct
volcanoes, and their symmetric cones dot the horizon in every
direction.</TE>
<TE>   As if on cue, the sun broke through around noon as I pulled into
Le Chambon. It's a small place, with fewer than 3,000 residents.
During the relatively short and busy summer on the Plateau du Velay,
Le Chambon is a minor tourist destination for the French, offering
mainly outdoor activities such as hiking, birding, fishing and
rafting. The few blocks around the Place de la Fontaine, the town
square, have pastry and food shops, a couple of bookstores and even a
small cinema.</TE>
<TE>   Le Chambon, like most villages in the area, is a Huguenot town.
Its history of persecution at the hands of the Catholic majority
could explain why about 3,000 people of this village--and many more
from the surrounding area--risked their lives to shelter and hide
Jewish refugees from German and French authorities. More than one
Chambonais was murdered for refusing to give up the secret kept by
virtually everyone in town at a time when other French villagers
couldn't turn in their Jewish compatriots fast enough.</TE>
<TE>   I checked into the Hotel Bel Horizon, a comfortable inn with 20
rooms less than a mile from the square. Its dining room was spacious,
and at lunch it appeared that I was the only tourist there. It wasn't
empty, however, as people at a computer conference took up most of
the other tables.</TE>
<TE>   The food was simple and reflected local specialties, a presse of
sliced potatoes and Lignon trout, like a dense pate, and a tranche of
fricasseed ham--a pork dumpling--on a bed of lentils. But food was a
secondary interest. I wanted to learn what I could about Le Chambon's
compelling history.</TE>
<TE>   I walked to the tourist office on the square. The young woman at
the desk, Claire, spoke English very well but did not know much about
the refugees. A helpful soul, she took me by the hand, walked me
across the square to a tiny exposition hall on the corner, and
introduced me to Annick Flaud.</TE>
<TE>   Flaud, a retired Paris lawyer who moved to Le Chambon to raise her
children, has taken it upon herself to be the public spokeswoman for
Le Chambon's heroic resistance. She spent an hour shepherding me
through a small three-room exhibit documenting the work of Protestant
pastor Andre Trocme, whose family and other villagers organized the
rescue operation, which took place from 1940 to 1944.</TE>
<TE>   Flaud, an opinionated personality only partly comfortable with
English, was critical of the one well-known account of that period,
Philip Hallie's "Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed." "Hallie was a better
ethicist than a historian," she said when I mentioned his book,
suggesting that Hallie gave too much credit to Trocme and understated
the role of the community. Not only was Le Chambon a haven for
refugees, she pointed out, but a dozen or so of the surrounding
villages also followed suit.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit consisted mainly of photographs and documents from the
period, with an English program that enabled me to follow the French
captions more easily. Only one or two other people wandered in while
I was there, and because Flaud appeared eager to close up the hall, I
decided to explore the town on foot.</TE>
<TE>   Le Chambon is a hilly town with winding streets and houses of
stone and brick, nestled against the Lignon River. I walked a few
blocks from the now-empty railway station to the temple presbytery,
once the Trocmes' home, the same route taken by thousands of Jewish
refugees. Stopping before what some refugees called the "poetic gate"
outside the pastor's residence, I imagined those frightened souls in
the moments before Magda Trocme, the pastor's wife, hustled them
inside to food and warmth, and from there to homes and schools
throughout the area.</TE>
<TE>   When refugees arrived at the railroad station, they would have
been directed to the Protestant presbytery, where, after being
comforted and fed, they were bundled off to live with local families.
Many refugees were given false identity papers and blended into the
mountain communities, working or attending school; some stayed long
enough to secure passage to Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Germans knew of refugees' presence, their few raids
were mostly unsuccessful, as time after time the villagers refused to
identify or give them up. At times the Jews were hidden in remote
farmhouses or forests. "We do not know what a Jew is," the Chambonais
said time and again. "We know only men."</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Germans were never successful in capturing some. In
the summer of 1943, the Gestapo raided a home for adolescent boys
supervised by Daniel Trocme, the pastor's cousin. Along with 11 boys,
Daniel was arrested, and he died in 1944 at Majdanek extermination
camp in Poland.</TE>
<TE>   I stopped at Trocme's unimposing stone church near the river, and
the cemetery where he is buried beneath a simple stone that
identifies him only as "Pastor."</TE>
<TE>   Characteristically, aside from a placard on the school opposite
the church commemorating in Hebrew and French the heroism of the war
years, Le Chambon displays no references to its shining moment. The
people of the village always diverted attention from their heroic
act, saying they did no more than their creed demanded.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning I rose with the sun at about 7. Already in the
middle of September it was cold, with the smell of wood fires thick
in the air. I spent most of that day driving the back roads of the
Auvergne visiting a few of the neighboring villages.</TE>
<TE>   The D-103 was tranquil, weaving through undulating spruce forests
and pasturelands punctuated by the occasional cornfield and dozens of
domelike hills and ridgelines in the background. Fattened geese
waddled outside the stone farmhouses and barns, along with the cattle
and horses. There wasn't much traffic, and I took it all in slowly,
like a Sunday driver.</TE>
<TE>   At the village of Tence, I got out and explored the town, which I
had visited a few years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   I wandered past the pleasant, vine-covered Hostellerie Placide.
Flaud had told me that one refugee spent the entire war playing
bridge in its lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Not ready to leave that perfect fall day behind, I continued
driving into the Ardeche for another hour before heeding the pangs of
hunger and returning to Hotel Bel Horizon for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The following morning I left for Paris, where I had arranged to
meet my cousin Ralph Jacob, a Holocaust survivor whose father was
murdered at Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria.</TE>
<TE>   I decided to take a long, slow route back north to fit in a visit
to Oradour-sur-Glane, another village with a war connection. I drove
a northwesterly course through the heart of the Puy-de-Dome region,
studded with volcanoes and foliage-covered rock domes. The leaves
were starting to change color, and I passed through one gem of a town
after another.</TE>
<TE>   My route took me west toward Limoges. I turned northwest onto tiny
departmental roads and followed them for 12 miles to Oradour. If Le
Chambon is a symbol of the triumph of life, Oradour is its dark
opposite.</TE>
<TE>   An unremarkable market town, Oradour achieved grim immortality on
June 10, 1944, just four days after the Normandy invasion.</TE>
<TE>   The German army surrounded the village early that morning and
destroyed it, executing its 642 inhabitants, including children, and
demolishing its 328 buildings. The reason for the massacre is unclear
even today, though many believe it was probably in retaliation for
Resistance activities in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The village is almost as the Germans left it, and it is a sobering
sight. Accessible through a modern visitors center, Oradour is a
ghostly collection of jagged ruins, with the detritus of daily
life--pots and pans, appliances, eyeglasses, a baby carriage--strewn
among the rubble of dead shops and houses. Wrecked cars occupy their
final parking spots. Electric wires hang powerless over the silent
streets. No one is home.</TE>
<TE>   An hour or two wandering through Oradour is enough to conjure up a
little of the horror the villagers faced in 1944.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few signs and placards identifying the buildings and
pointing out places of execution, but the desolation speaks for
itself.</TE>
<TE>   The Centre de la Memoire, a modern multimedia center, had a
bookstore, photo exhibits, a library and a small theater, and the
multilingual staff was pleased to answer questions about the
memorial. Quite a few French visitors took the walk with me that day.</TE>
<TE>   I left by way of the new village of Oradour, rebuilt after the war
within sight of the old, and headed north.</TE>
<TE>   I stopped at a patisserie in the village of Pontarion to buy a
mille-feuille. At a rest stop outside town, looking out over the
hills of Limousin, I savored this perfect pastry. Some might think it
disconcerting to enjoy such simple pleasures on a journey that had
taken me into the depths of evil at Oradour and the height of human
decency at Le Chambon. Horror would always be with us in one form or
another, as Sept. 11 had demonstrated so stunningly only a few days
earlier. But, while paying homage to the heroes and victims of World
War II, I had learned that light can shine through even the darkest
moments of history.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting by the roadside, I recalled the words of a mother of three
kids who were saved in Le Chambon: "The Holocaust was storm,
lightning, thunder, wind, rain, yes. And Le Chambon was the rainbow."</TE>

<TE>   Where to eat: The mostly rural Auvergne is not the home of haute
cuisine. Nevertheless, you can eat well there, especially if you like
meat, potatoes and lentils. My favorite restaurant was the dining
room of the Hostellerie Placide, but the Bel Horizon provided
memorable meals as well. Several restaurants in Le Chambon specialize
in regional cuisine, hearty country food emphasizing Auvergne beef,
ham and sausages, rabbit and fish from local rivers, plus lots of
potatoes and lentils. Dinner at most places shouldn't cost more than
$20-$30, including wine.</TE>

<HD>Exercise and Spa Pampering Play Bigger Part of Shipboard
Rituals</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Not many years ago, the typical shipboard spa was a small, windowless
gym set in the bowels of the vessel with a couple of exercise
machines and a water cooler. If the ship was a former ocean liner,
there might also be an indoor swimming pool. The beauty salon,
staffed by a couple of hairdressers and a manicurist, was in a more
populous part of the ship.</LD>
<LD>   But as cruisers got younger and more active, cruise lines began
devoting more space to spa facilities, giving them prime upper-deck
space with windows facing the sea. Today, spas can be as large as
25,000 square feet. Celebrity Cruises' AquaSpas, on the Millennium,
Infinity, Summit and new Constellation, are the largest.</LD>
<LD>   The spa, operated by Elemis Ltd., contains a fitness area with
more than 40 pieces of exercise equipment; two fitness instructors to
offer personal training; a beauty suite with hairstyling, manicure
and pedicure service; eight rooms for full-body treatments, plus one
with disabled access; a Turkish bath with sauna, steam and fog-like
showers; a thalassotherapy pool to soothe sports injuries or
arthritis; a quiet, private sensory retreat with fresh sea air and
cups of herbal tea; a facial center; four-hands massage; massage
instruction for couples; seaweed wraps; hand and foot treatments;
milk baths ... the pampering list goes on and on.</LD>
<TE>   The spa is set high atop the ship and forward, with a
captain's-eye view through the glass walls, and indoor and outdoor
swimming pools and gardens. You can even have a healthy lunch at the
Aqua- Spa Cafe.</TE>
<TE>   Second in size to the AquaSpas are the ShipShape Spas aboard Royal
Caribbean International's giant 3,114-passenger ships Voyager of the
Seas, Explorer of the Seas and Adventure of the Seas.</TE>
<TE>   The 16,100-square-foot spas occupy spots forward on decks 11 and
12 and have a huge gym, with exercise machines that face the sea.</TE>
<TE>   The same line's Radiance of the Seas, in its 15,500-square-foot
spa, provides a knockout two-deck solarium with an African safari
theme. Flanked by waterfalls, three 16-foot-high stone elephants
flanked by waterfalls watch over the solarium pool and whirlpools,
while a retractable glass roof can be opened or closed depending on
the weather. With 12 treatment rooms, 18 treadmills and a unisex
full-service beauty salon, passengers get more options for treatments
and a full schedule of classes and workouts.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing the popular Asian theme in spas is the 15,156-square-foot
Lotus Spa aboard Princess Cruises' new Star Princess, based in Los
Angeles for Mexican Riviera winter cruises and in Vancouver, Canada,
for Alaska summer sailings.</TE>
<TE>   The spa offers a tempting menu of treatments. We indulged in a
treatment apiece when we were aboard in March, a foot treatment and
pedicure ($55) and chakra stone therapy massage ($158). Both were
excellent but pricey.</TE>
<TE>   Carnival's largest ships, the Destiny, Triumph and Victory, have
15,000-square-foot Nautica Spas with aerobics room, juice bars,
separate men's and women's treatment areas, saunas, steam rooms and a
top-deck jogging track. Spa menus are featured at every meal for
passengers who want to control calorie and fat intake.</TE>
<TE>   The Barong Spa on Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Star, operated
by Mandara Spa, fills 11,517 square feet with Asian-accented services
in 21 treatment rooms, three of them for couples.</TE>
<TE>   From a Balinese coffee scrub to a coconut body polish, the theme
is exotic. An indoor lap pool is part of the spa, along with a
Jacuzzi, hot and cold baths in the men's area, and a sauna and steam
bath in the men's and women's areas.</TE>
<TE>   Outdoor massages on the isolated beaches of Fanning Island during
a port call are another specialty.</TE>
<TE>   The 10,000-square-foot WindSpa on Windstar Cruises' 312-passenger
Wind Surf provides the biggest spa space per passenger of all the
ships at sea, 320 square feet per guest.</TE>
<TE>   Besides a fitness room with exercise machines, the WindSpa has an
aerobics room, pool, ocean-view exercise space, and treatment rooms
for massage, facials and body wraps. Yoga, step aerobics, mineral
baths and menus of light and healthy and vegetarian meals planned by
nutritional consultant Jeanne Jones are on the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Vista Spa and Salon aboard Disney Cruise Line's ships Magic and
Wonder fill 9,000 square feet with a fitness center and beauty salon.</TE>
<TE>   Steiner of London created one of the first luxury spas at sea
aboard Cunard's Queen Elizabeth 2 in 1989. The 8,127-square-foot
space, divided between decks 6 and 7, includes an indoor pool, gym,
spa and thalassotherapy center.</TE>
<TE>   Steiner operates many seagoing spas, sometimes under the Elemis or
Lotus labels. It also owns a major percentage of Mandara Spas.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal Cruises' Harmony and Symphony consulted a feng shui expert
to arrange and decorate the 3,000-square-foot Crystal Spa and Salon
aboard each ship. From massages to beauty services, low-impact
body-stretching classes to high-energy aerobics, every day offers a
program of classes and treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Radisson Seven Seas Cruise Line, with five top-of-the-line luxury
vessels that carry from 180 to 700 passengers, has contracted with
smaller boutique-spa operators such as Carita of Paris on the Paul
Gauguin in Tahiti and Connecticut-based Judith Jackson, sometimes
called "the queen of aromatherapy," on the Seven Seas Mariner and
Seven Seas Navigator.</TE>

<LD>There's comfort in a kit with these new items. Prices do not include
shipping.</LD>
<LD>   Enlightened tools: At first glance, this inventive item looks like
a heavy-duty plastic flashlight, with a pivoting spotlight at one
end, an amber blinking light at the other and two safety reflectors
between. But flip the latch below the handle and the 14-by-8-by-3
1/2- inch body reveals an impressive tool kit. Full-size sturdy
implements include pliers, flat-head and Phillips-head screwdrivers,
hammer, adjustable wrench and a seven-piece Allen wrench set. Each
tool has its own compartment so nothing rattles around when the
flashlight is in use. The lights operate on four C batteries. The
car-lighter adapter will recharge batteries.</LD>
<LD>   Safety Light Tool Kit (218818) is $35 from Brookstone; (800)
351-7222, www.brookstone.com.</LD>

grooming essentials on a trip. The Deluxe Personal Care Kit has them
all, each neatly held by elastic inside a zippered leather case about
the size of a thick novel. The impressive array of guy gear includes
a battery-powered nose- and ear-hair groomer, cuticle scissors,
fingernail and toenail clippers, tweezers, a cuticle tool, sapphire
file, comb, corkscrew, bottle opener, penknife, twin-blade razor,
razor cartridges, lint brush, shoehorn, miniature rechargeable
electric shaver and a set of five worldwide adapter plugs. You'll
have to supply your own voltage converter for overseas, but otherwise
you're ready to roll.</TE>
<TE>   Deluxe Personal Care Kit (DM940) is $79.95 from the Sharper Image;
(800) 344-4444, www.sharperimage.com.</TE>
<TE>   Classy comforts: The stylish Tri-fold Necessities Case is a red
crinkle-nylon pouch containing a bright red inflatable pillow and eye
mask, a comb, mini-toothbrush and toothpaste. Each is housed in its
own pocket or zippered compartment. An extra 5-by-4-inch zippered
compartment can hold other items. When folded, the water-resistant
case measures 6 1/2 by 5 by 1 1/4 inches. It fastens with a Velcro
strap and has a metal ring for hanging or attaching keys. It fits
easily in a handbag.</TE>
<TE>   Kipling Tribeca Trifold Necessities Case (2189) is $25. For

<HD>A Classic View of New England From Massachusetts' Cape Ann</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Never mind Cape Cod. The "other cape" in Massachusetts has good
hiking too. Roam the rocky headlands of Cape Ann, and you will see
one of the state's most striking coastal tableaux: craggy islands,
fishing boats on Ipswich Bay and a view that runs all the way to
Maine.</LD>
<LD>   Cape Ann is a community of small towns and cities about 30 miles
northeast of Boston. Vacationers can enjoy woodsy hikes and fine,
history-filled walks along with the region's attractive waterfront,
art galleries, museums and whale-watching cruises. I'll detail two
good spots: a park in Gloucester and a place called Halibut Point.</LD>
<LD>   Gloucester gained attention recently because it was the home port
of the ill-fated fishermen whose last voyage was dramatized in "The
Perfect Storm," the 1997 book by Sebastian Junger and the 2000 movie.
The city, settled in 1623, is America's oldest seaport and remains
one of the busiest fishing ports on the East Coast.</LD>
<TE>   The best hiking around Gloucester is at Ravenswood Park, which
offers more than 500 acres of woodland, including red oak, white
pine, maple and birch. It also has some weird-looking fields of
boulders, called "erratics," left over from the continent's last
glacial retreat. Ten miles of easy trails and carriage paths weave
around huckleberry and blueberry bushes and through the woods.</TE>
<TE>   Halibut Point is Cape Ann's northernmost point and site of a state
park and an adjacent, privately owned reservation, both of which
provide public access to the dramatic coast. A network of trails
explores the bold bluffs and intriguing history of the area.</TE>
<TE>   "Haul-about" is what ship captains used to called Halibut Point.
Wind and waves batter the point, particularly during one of those
awesome nor'easters.</TE>
<TE>   Halibut Point State Park sits on land where a granite quarry
greatly expanded around 1900. Stone blocks weighing as much as 40
tons were removed with the help of steam-powered drills, hoists and
trains. But as more builders chose cement over cut stone and as the
Depression took its toll, the quarry closed.</TE>
<TE>   Self-guided paths now run through the land. Get the latest trail
information from the state park headquarters, a converted World War
II observation tower originally intended to help defend Boston. A
small museum conveys the area's history.</TE>
<TE>   Trails pass rows of apple, wild cherry, oak and hickory trees. One
path visits the Babson Farm quarry, now a large pond. Don't miss the
great view from atop a huge heap of waste stone.</TE>
<TE>   During the summer months, quarry tours and stone-splitting
demonstrations are given every Saturday morning. The park also hosts
occasional winter bird-watching walks.</TE>
<TE>   In adjacent Halibut Point Reservation, a waterfront path leads to
steep bluffs and tide pools. The view north includes Plum Island, New
Hampshire's Seabrook nuclear power plant and the Isle of Shoals.
Choate Island, also called Hog Island, lies to the south.</TE>
<TE>   Rockport, the nearby fishing village turned artists' colony, has a
picturesque Main Street lined with galleries and shops, as well as a
quaint, inspiring harbor. Both are worth a walk.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trails: Ravens- wood Park is on Route 127
(Western Avenue) in Gloucester.</TE>
<TE>   Halibut Point is a few miles north on Route 127. Turn right on
Gott Avenue and into Halibut Point Reservation. Note signs that
forbid street parking; visitors must enter the reserve.</TE>

<LD>Zebra or elephant? Green section or red?</LD>
<LD>   It's 11 p.m., and the kids are exhausted after a day of roller
coasters, water slides and too much junk food. But instead of putting
them to bed, you're herding the cranky gang around the enormous
theme-park parking lot in search of your car.</LD>
<LD>   I've been in theme-park lots late at night, more times than I care
to remember. As if it weren't enough to spend 10 hours at a hot,
crowded park with kids on a sugar high who can never agree which
rides they want to try. If only you were in a nice, cool hotel room,
drinking a glass of wine. If only you didn't need to find that car.</LD>
<TE>   Some wishes can come true. Taking their cue from Walt Disney
World, growing numbers of theme parks are building and refurbishing
hotels and offering more stay-and-play packages so that tired
families can extend their experience overnight. Other hotels near
theme parks offer an array of hotel-and-park packages.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a trend," says Brett Lovejoy, president of the
International Assn. of Amusement Parks and Attractions.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these theme-park hotels offer great perks and discounts to
their guests.</TE>
<TE>   If you book a two-night hotel-and-park package at Disneyland this
summer, each child will get a three-day park-hopper ticket free with
each paid adult ticket. Packages include breakfast and start at $403
per adult. (This rate saves $90 per child.)</TE>
<TE>   You can split a six-night stay between Disneyland and San Diego
for less than $800 per adult, double occupancy required. The
Land-and-Sand package includes hotel and admission to the Disney
parks--Disneyland and California Adventure--plus Sea World, the San
Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park. Call (877) 700-3476 or visit
www.disneyland.com.</TE>
<TE>   If you stay at one of the three Loews hotels at Universal Studios
Orlando (including the new 1,000-room Royal Pacific Resort), you can
bypass lines at the park by showing your room key. Four-night
packages start at $99 per adult per night, including three-day parks
admission and a day at Wet 'n Wild. The package costs $120 for kids
up to 17, and just over $100 for those younger than 10. If the kids
have at least one "A" on their report cards during the past year
(bring a copy of the report card as proof), they can get free drinks
and other goodies at all Loews hotels this summer. Call (800)
711-0080 or visit www.universalstudiosvacations.com.</TE>
<TE>   Jump from 18th century Virginia to the 21st century with Summer
Wild Card packages that include hotels and unlimited admission to
Colonial Williamsburg, Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Water Country
USA. Two-night packages for a family of four can cost as little as
$547. Call (800) HISTORY (447-8679) or visit www.history.org. For
more packages, call (800) 395-4386 or visit www.buschgardens.com.</TE>
<TE>   Some hotels have special themes, so the fantasy doesn't
necessarily end at the theme-park gates.</TE>
<TE>   If you stay in the Snoopy wing at Knott's Berry Farm Radisson
Resort in Buena Park, Snoopy will come tuck in the kids at night.
He'll also leave a chocolate dog bone on their pillows. Two-night
packages that include breakfast and admission to the park and to
Knott's Soak City start at $299 for a family of four. Call (714)
995-1111 or visit www.knotts.com.</TE>
<TE>   The great thing about these on-site accommodations is that you
almost certainly won't feel as rushed or get as tired. If you have at
least two adults along, perhaps one can take the baby back to an
air-conditioned room for a nap while the other takes the rest of the
kids for their third ride on that new roller coaster. Grandma and
Grandpa can return to the hotel whenever they like.</TE>
<TE>   Booking a room on site, even for one night, can turn that long day
at the park into a mini-vacation. With the time you save, the family
can explore the lesser-known attractions. A midafternoon siesta will
be just the ticket to get everyone ready for a serious night of
coaster-riding and fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer at Disneyland, my teens took an afternoon nap in the
air-conditioned comfort of Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, adjacent
to the California Adventure Park, while I took the younger kids on
their favorite rides.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when the little ones were ready to call it a night, the
teens were glad they didn't have to leave with the rest of the
family.</TE>
<TE>   Forget the roller coasters. I'll see you at the pool.</TE>

<LD>I wanted to shed additional light on the findings noted in "In an Era
of Turbulence, Airline Satisfaction Rising" (Travel Insider, July
21). Despite the decline in passenger traffic and reductions in
flight schedules after Sept. 11, the customer service initiatives
announced by our member airlines in June 1999 are achieving results.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout 2001--even before the events of Sept. 11--our members
were making significant improvements in every performance category, a
trend that is continuing this year. Delays are down, mishandled
baggage rates are declining, flight cancellations continue to drop,
on-time performance is at its highest level in years and, not
surprisingly, customer complaints have fallen dramatically.</LD>
<LD>   When delays decline, flights don't have to be canceled. When
flights aren't canceled, baggage is handled properly, on-time
performance rises and customer complaints decline.</LD>

<LD>   Regarding Christopher Reynolds' article "A Hop Above Santa
Barbara, Camp Cushy" (Weekend Escape, July 21): For years my family
and I enjoyed El Capitan when it was a "rustic campground." It was
one of the most beautiful campgrounds along the Central Coast. I was
disappointed at new owner Chuck Blitz's decision to go upscale.</LD>
<LD>   As for Reynolds' reaction to the camping prices and the prices in
the general store: There's a sucker born every minute.</LD>

<TE>   Although I enjoy Weekend Escapes, they can be a bit costly, and
Reynolds' was no exception.</TE>
<TE>   For 15 years our Sunday school camped at El Capitan on Memorial
Day weekends, and it was not rustic. There were full hookups on
grassy areas, and people with tents could set up next to those in
RVs. The only improvement needed was in the bathroom plumbing.</TE>
<TE>   If you must cook your meals and have a smelly bathroom, why go?
For $172 a night, there are cheaper places to take a family for a
weekend of camping.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We visited St. Albans in May, so we thoroughly enjoyed John Lee's
excellent article ("St. Albans' Sacred Place in History," July 21).
However, he omitted the one fact that interested me most: Two
important battles of the War of the Roses took place there. The
first, in 1455, was the opening engagement in that brutal struggle
for the crown. The Lancastrians held the town but were defeated, and
Henry VI was captured by the Duke of York. Six years later the tables
were turned when Queen Margaret and her forces routed the Yorkists
and freed her husband, the king. These contests largely took place on
the streets of the town, but of course there's little evidence of
this.</LD>

<HD>Pot Luck Along the Road to Santa Fe</HD>
<DH>Visits to New Mexico's pueblos add shape and color to a
pottery lover's growing collection</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES T. YENCKEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SANTA FE, N.M.</DL>
<LD>The words astonished me when I read them:</LD>
<LD>   "Pueblo people believe clay has life. Potters speak to it, pray to
it, revere it."</LD>
<LD>   My wife, Sandy, and I have been modest collectors of Pueblo
pottery for 14 years, and still I was surprised when I read those
lines recently at a Pueblo exhibit at Santa Fe's Museum of Indian
Arts and Culture. Here was a spiritual explanation for a potter's
dedication. And maybe it explained why Pueblo pottery intrigues us.</LD>
<TE>   From one polished black bowl, purchased on our first visit to
Santa Fe in 1988, our collection has grown to 28 bowls, jars, pots,
seed catchers and whimsical "storytellers," an adult man or woman
holding half a dozen youngsters in lap and arms. Pueblo pottery is a
living presence in our household. Hardly a day goes by that I don't
pick up a piece, caressing it as I might a beloved pet. Can there be
a better souvenir of a stay in New Mexico?</TE>
<TE>   On a 10-day visit last month to Santa Fe and Taos, we went pottery
hunting. As amateur collectors, we were not looking for the best
workmanship or historic treasures; those pots cost thousands of
dollars. Nor were we interested in the best price. We were looking
for fun and cultural insights and for stories to tell of our shopping
adventures. On this trip, we bought four pieces ranging from $40 to
$310. Each appealed to us as the work of a skilled and dedicated
potter.</TE>
<TE>   Our first excursion was to Taos Pueblo, about three miles north of
the city of Taos. About 50 Pueblo Indians live in the two major adobe
buildings, much as their ancestors did in 1540, when the Spanish
conquistadors showed up. Now, as then, there is no electricity, no
telephone, no plumbing. Water is carried by bucket from a lake-fed
stream.</TE>
<TE>   Taos Pueblo is the northernmost of New Mexico's 19 pueblos, or
reservations. Most are concentrated on or near the Rio Grande and are
easy day trips from Santa Fe and Taos. All welcome visitors, although
with varying degrees of hospitality. A fee is charged at some. At
Taos it's $10 per person, which includes a 20-minute escorted tour of
the historic plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The two main buildings on the plaza, the North House and the South
House, are believed to date to about 1450, said our guide, a young
tribal member named Tiffany. That would make them among the oldest
residential structures in continuous use in North America. They
resemble apartments stacked haphazardly five stories high, each story
reached by a ladder from the terrace below. Their rounded edges and
flat roofs have come to characterize Southwestern architecture. Santa
Fe, the beautiful old state capital, looks like one vast pueblo.</TE>
<TE>   It was in the South House after the tour that we met Juanita
Martinez. A noted maker of storytellers, she operates a small shop
out of her home, one of about 25 shops on the plaza. Years ago we
bought a small Martinez storyteller from the Carson House Shop, a
Taos gallery. Now here she was.</TE>
<TE>   She was born on the Jemez Pueblo to the south, married a member of
the Taos tribe and remained after he died. The clay she uses is from
Jemez and the mountains behind Taos. The Taos clay contains mica,
which gives a distinctive sparkle to Taos pottery.</TE>
<TE>   Most storytellers are made as standing or sitting figures. Lately,
Martinez has been shaping lounging storytellers, as if resting under
a hot afternoon sun.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are her eyes closed?" I asked, pointing to one I had already
decided was a taker.</TE>
<TE>   "Because she's seeing the story in her mind as she tells it to the
children," Martinez replied.</TE>
<TE>   In her shop, Martinez was selling the 7- or 8-inch storytellers
for $85, which I considered more than reasonable. Out of curiosity,
we stopped by the Carson House Shop later that day to check its price
for one of her storytellers. Oops, just $75. No matter; ours came
with its own real-life story to tell.</TE>
<TE>   On and off the pueblos, we talked to Pueblo potters and dealers
about prices and concluded that they are as complex and confusing as
airline fares. The award-winning potters tend to get the best prices
for their work--as much as $18,000 in some cases. Typically, they
sell directly to galleries. Others, like Martinez, market at home and
in the galleries--some offering the galleries a discount for multiple
purchases. A few spread blankets under the portal in front of Santa
Fe's Palace of the Governors, built by the Spanish in 1610. That's
where we paid only $40 for an exquisite little pot by Laverne Loretto
from the Jemez Pueblo. We like it as much as the $310 bowl by Angela
Baca we'd bought earlier in the day when we visited the Santa Clara
Pueblo.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the pricing challenge, seemingly identical pieces by the
same potter can vary widely in price because one reflects better
workmanship--although only experts can spot the difference. Our rule
of thumb is to buy what we like and can afford--preferably from the
potter.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe, set in high desert country at the foot of the Sangre de
Cristo Mountains, is a highly sophisticated, arts-oriented community.
It is known for excellent museums and dozens of galleries. Nowhere
else in the country is there such a concentration of art within easy
walking distance.</TE>
<TE>   If you're not familiar with Pueblo pottery, the best way to get
started is to browse the major pottery galleries in Santa Fe (Andrea
Fisher Fine Pottery or Packards) and in Taos (Carson House). This
will introduce you to the work of some of the best potters, many of
whom you can visit on their pueblos. Also spend an hour or two at the
Museum of Indian Arts &amp; Culture in Santa Fe, where pottery exhibits
detail the pueblos' differing styles. Look for symmetry, uniform
glossiness and clear, neatly executed decorative images.</TE>
<TE>   On a visit to Packards in Santa Fe, we sought advice from manager
Don Davies. Beware of "greenware," he warned. This is pottery made of
liquid clay poured into molds, and it's hard for amateurs to
distinguish from a hand-worked pot. One giveaway is pottery that's
advertised as "Pueblo painted."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, we didn't know any of this 14 years ago. We were just
lucky. Back then, the first pueblo we visited was San Ildefonso,
about 25 miles north of Santa Fe. Occupying 26,000 acres, it is on
flat, arid land at the foot of low brown hills. In the village, a
little Spanish colonial church and one-story adobe homes are
clustered around a dusty plaza. About 700 tribal members live here.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most famous pottery pueblos, San Ildefonso was the
birthplace in 1887 of Maria Martinez, who is credited with sparking a
pottery-making renaissance throughout the Southwest. Her
black-on-black pots are expensive collectors' items. But in a small
pueblo gallery that first day, we bought a lovely bowl made in the
Maria Martinez style by her grandniece, Helen Gutierrez.</TE>
<TE>   A day or two later, we learned that Gutierrez had been recognized
for her pottery at that summer's Indian Market in Santa Fe. And then
we spotted one of her bowls on display at the delightful Millicent
Rogers Museum in Taos. Our little pot, it turned out, boasted
impressive credentials.</TE>
<TE>   In July we returned to San Ildefonso, hoping to find Gutierrez,
whose work now is included in the collection of the Museum of Indian
Arts. The village still looked worn and dusty, a quiet place where a
trio of dogs napped in the shade of a towering cottonwood. At the
visitor kiosk, we paid a $3 parking fee and picked up a map to the
pottery shops. Enter anywhere a sign reads "Pottery--Welcome," the
clerk at the desk said. When I asked, we were told that Gutierrez
died a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   As we headed on foot to the pueblo museum, a couple of boys sped
past on wobbly bicycles, waving vigorously and erasing any lingering
fears that we might be intruding. Several times we stepped indoors to
find ourselves in a family living room, a corner of which served as a
pottery shop.</TE>
<TE>   At the museum, an exhibit described how pots are made. Local red
and white clay is gathered and shaped into slender coils that are
stacked one on top of the other, then smoothed by hand--not with a
potter's wheel. A fine slip of water and clay is applied. Then the
final polishing is done with a stone, and a design is painted on.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the tricky part: the firing. This is done not in a kiln
but outside over a grate. Cakes of dried manure are stacked around
the pots and set afire. The pot may emerge red in color. Or if black
is sought, the fire is doused with pulverized manure, producing a
blackening soot. It's not unusual for carefully worked pieces to
crack or become badly smudged.</TE>
<TE>   At the Aguilar Indian Arts shop, a father-and-son operation, I
asked son Michael Aguilar how long it took him to complete a small
pot this way. "About 20 hours," he said, displaying a small, graceful
red pot priced at $239. Aguilar has adopted a technique popular with
younger potters called sgraffito, which involves scraping through the
slip before firing to expose the clay underneath. On this pot,
Aguilar had etched a kokopelli, the Indian flute player. It came home
with us.</TE>
<TE>   My reporter's instinct compelled me to ask whether potters were
ever willing to negotiate. "Some potters deal," he replied, "and some
don't. You've got to ask. In summer we get lots of buyers. If I don't
sell today, I'll sell tomorrow. In winter we see fewer people. If a
potter has got lots of pots, he may deal."</TE>
<TE>   Some potters--like the acclaimed Barbara Gonzales, whose shop,
Sunbeam Indian Arts, is a few steps away--are decorating with
turquoise inlays in addition to sgraffito. All of the Gonzales
family--husband Robert, four sons and grandchildren--are in the
trade. "It runs through the genes," said Robert, noting that his wife
is the great-granddaughter of Maria Martinez. As might be expected,
even Barbara's smaller pots are pricey, beginning at about $450.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara Pueblo, a 10-minute drive north, is the premier
pottery-making reservation. An estimated 400 potters in a population
of fewer than 3,000 produce highly polished red or black pieces, many
bearing the design of avanyu, a water serpent. Here we stopped at
Merrock Galeria, the shop of Paul Speckled Rock. He told us so much
about his aunt Angela Baca--we had seen her pots in fine Santa Fe and
Taos shops--that we had to take home a large, elegantly shaped orange
bowl with deep pleated ridges. Price: $310.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 miles away at Bandelier National Monument, site of
ancient Anasazi cliff dwellings and caves deep in Frijoles Canyon,
the museum shop offered a similar bowl for $345. "Good for us," I
thought. In Santa Fe, at the museum shop in the Palace of the
Governors, the price for a seeming duplicate was $250. Who can
explain it? Anyway, we know Baca's nephew. That's something of a
story.</TE>
<TE>   For a dramatic setting, head for the pueblo of Acoma, 45 miles
east of Albuquerque. Sky City, the ancient home of the Acoma Indians,
sits atop a sheer-faced, 367-foot-high mesa. A few families still
live year-round in the terraced adobe dwellings, another of the
oldest communities in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   To enter Sky City, outsiders must take an hourlong tour ($10).
Once, only guarded secret trails ascended the heights; today a paved
road climbs in steep curves, and we were escorted up in a small bus.
After the tour we were invited to descend one of the old paths.</TE>
<TE>   The Acoma are skilled pottery-makers. Their hand-molded pots are
noted for thinness and intricate geometric designs, painted in black,
red and shades of orange. A dozen or more potters--there are hundreds
on the 345,000-acre reservation--display their craft in Sky City's
narrow streets.</TE>
<TE>   While I chatted with a couple of women selling hot Indian fry
bread, Sandy ducked away to buy (for $65) a small multicolored pot.
She handed it to me as we made our way to the steep downhill path.
Never sure-footed, I slipped, cracking the pot as I fell to the
ground. At home we patched it up, and only we know of the break.</TE>
<TE>   That's the story this little souvenir tells.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: The little stream in the Dutch town of Volendam
seemed so idyllic: two lovely swans, their graceful necks reflected
in the still water, their adorable cygnets swimming all around. But
as Dori Anderson of Pacific Palisades snapped away with her camera,
husband Richard knew something was amiss. He spied a woman in the
house across the street. She kept peeking through her lace
curtains--and giggling.  Richard finally figured out the joke.
"They're not real," he told Dori. And he was right: The swans were
fakes--painted plastic replicas that bobbed and drifted like the real
things.</CP>

<HD>Might Yoga Help Prevent Jet Lag? It's Not That Much of a
Stretch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm a frequent traveler and a sometime student of yoga. These two
activities, one draining, the other restoring, can converge in
beneficial ways, I have discovered.</LD>
<LD>   About 28 million Americans pursue yoga, according to the Yoga
Research and Education Center in Santa Rosa, Calif. The ancient
Indian physical and spiritual regimen that has swept this country has
even made a showing in the travel industry. Yoga retreats abound in
beautiful places: the pine forests of Montana, the beaches of Hawaii.
You can take a yoga cruise or vacation at a yoga center, as I did
last year at Kripalu in the Berkshire Mountains of western
Massachusetts.</LD>
<LD>   People who don't know cow and cat from downward-facing dog--two
common yoga poses--and wouldn't dream of taking a vacation devoted to
tying oneself in a knot may notice that yoga is turning up in travel
in other ways. JetBlue, the economy airline that started service two
years ago, teamed up with Crunch Fitness, which operates 19 health
clubs nationwide, to design an Airplane Yoga card, placed in the
seat-back pouch. It shows passengers how to keep relaxed and
comfortable by doing four simple exercises without ever leaving their
seats.</LD>
<TE>   JetBlue marketing Vice President Amy Curtis-McIntyre thinks of the
cards as small, powerful gestures of humanity, uncommon in airline
travel. "Yoga practitioners are thrilled to see them," she says.
"Others just laugh at the unexpected and delightful surprise."</TE>
<TE>   Yoga has arrived in travel gear shops too, in the form of portable
decks of cards that help travelers remember the different poses.
Cyndi Lee, a New York yoga teacher and author of "Om Yoga: A Guide to
Daily Practice" (Chronicle Books, 2002), and a record producer friend
created "Yoga in a Box" (distributed by Hay House in Carlsbad,
Calif.). It comes in beginner, intermediate and advanced levels and
includes two yoga CDs, a yoga deck, a yoga strap (used to help
practitioners with stretches), a stick of incense and a candle. When
the box is open, it looks a little like an altar.</TE>
<TE>   Lee thinks yoga helps rejuvenate travelers after long, cramped,
dehydrating, jet-lag-inducing plane trips. But you don't have to take
it to extremes. "If you have just one minute, do downward-facing
dog," she says. "Holding it that long is hard." In seven minutes, she
says, a yoga student could do downward-facing dog (with palms and
feet on the floor and the body in an inverted V), a twist, a
headstand and that favorite yoga position called savasana, or corpse
pose, which involves lying on your back. Upon arrival, Lee suggests a
20-minute practice that includes a simple inversion pose, lying on
the floor on your back with your legs propped against a wall;
downward-facing dog, which moves the blood around the body and opens
up the joints; cow and cat, a series of contractions and back arches
done on your hands and knees; any twist; and a sinus-cleansing form
of breathing that involves quick, forceful exhalation.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, different yogis have different approaches gleaned from
years of intensive travel to teach workshops and retreats. John
Friend, the developer of a popular yoga system called Anusara,
travels 250 days a year, including three world tours, but he never
feels jet-lagged. He favors a strong practice on arrival, emphasizing
seven- to 10-minute holds of inversion poses such as shoulder stands
and headstands that help travelers feel reenergized. For beginners,
he suggests the same easy legs-against-a-wall posture that Lee likes,
held for 15 minutes. "I'm not sure anyone knows why reversing the
blood flow [in an inversion] works so well. But it definitely affects
vital force," Friend says.</TE>
<TE>   Baron Baptiste, another popular American yogi who teaches students
an athletic form of "power yoga" at his Cambridge, Mass., studio,
does get jet-lagged and feels the pain of flying in his lower back,
hips, neck and shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   "Flying makes the body contract. Yoga is an amazing way to work
out the kinks," he says. He does his daily yoga routine as soon as he
arrives at his destination.</TE>
<TE>   As a former student of his, I can attest to the fact that it is
grueling and sweat-producing. The idea, he says, is to "rinse your
body out like a sponge so you feel clear physically and mentally."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica yoga teacher Shiva Rea combines a light yoga practice
on arrival with her knowledge of Ayurvedic medicine to rebound after
a trip, keeping hydrated by drinking water and taking steam baths.
This rectifies physical imbalances caused by flying, she says. And
Elise Browning Miller, coauthor of "Life Is a Stretch: Easy Yoga
Anytime, Anywhere" (Llewellyn Publications, 1999), makes sure she
schedules an extra day in her trips so she can do her own yoga
practice before getting down to the work of teaching. "Not planning
too much in one day helps to guarantee a practice," Miller says. "I
have learned to say no to things. That's a hard one."</TE>
<TE>   I believe there's a yoga state of mind that can enrich travel. For
Friend, it involves learning how to be comfortable and happy on the
road, whatever the surroundings; he thinks aversions create bodily
dysfunction. Baptiste says yoga helps release people from their
self-centered worldview so they're more present and better able to
connect with others. And Miller puts it like this: "After doing yoga,
you're open to letting things happen rather than controlling them and
content with what the adventure is bringing you."</TE>
<TE>   It's all about traveling with peace, or namaste, as yoga students
say at the end of class.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stalk grizzly bears--with a camera--in the wild backlands of British
Columbia's Coast Range on an unusual daylong nature tour that
includes orcas, gray whales, eagles, wolves and churning tidal
rapids.</LD>
<LD>   The excursions, available now through mid-October, focus on seeing
grizzlies on their home turf. "The salmon are running right now,
coming into the rivers to spawn, and that brings the bears out of the
woods to feed on fish," said biologist Tom Rivest, co-owner of Great
Bear Nature Tours.</LD>
<LD>   The area, known as the Great Bear Rainforest, stretches over 8
million acres. Trips begin in Port Hardy, near the northern tip of
Vancouver Island. Participants take a morning boat ride to see whales
and the Nakwakto Tidal Rapids and then travel by skiff up the Seymour
River to grizzly-bear viewing sites. During salmon runs, participants
view bears from tree stands and river blinds that have been
constructed to allow safe photo opportunities. The tour concludes
with a flight over the Coast Range back to Port Hardy. Overnight
trips are also available.</LD>
<TE>   Cost: $244, including transportation on the day of the tour, lunch
and snacks. Longer trips range from $456 for one night to $1,046 for
three nights. Transportation to Port Hardy, B.C. and air fare from
Los Angeles are not included.</TE>

<TE>   London: Show Time</TE>
<TE>   A holiday-season tour to England will focus on the London theater
scene, with four West End shows on the schedule for the 10-day trip.</TE>
<TE>   The annual excursion, which departs on Dec. 26 from Los Angeles,
is planned and led by actor and director Stan Mazin. It includes a
New Year's Eve party for tour participants. The group spends eight
nights at the Radisson Edwardian Mountbatten Plaza Hotel in the
Covent Garden area.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $2,275 per person, double occupancy. Included are round-trip
air fare on Air New Zealand, transfers into London, upgraded

<TE>   Ireland: Onstage</TE>
<TE>   The performing arts will take center stage for a tour to Ireland

International Theatre Festival, where tour participants will attend
four performances. They will also visit the Siamsa Tire, Ireland's
National Folk Theatre, for a dance and theater program based on
Gaelic folk traditions. Pubs--the birthplace of some of Ireland's

<LD>With hog-calling and pigs' feet-eating contests between innings, the
minor league Fort Worth Cats recently staged "You Might Be a Redneck
Night."</LD>
<LD>   The ballpark promotion seemingly was a hit with everyone except
the Cats' opponent, the Jackson (Miss.) Senators, who became offended
when the public-address announcer informed the crowd that it's a good
clue you're a redneck if you:</LD>
<LD>   "Manage the Jackson Senators; Play for the Jackson Senators; Live
in Jackson, Miss.; All of the above."</LD>
<TE>   With the sound of cowbells saluting them as they stepped into the
batter's box, the irate Senators promptly scored six runs in the
first three innings.</TE>
<TE>   Unfazed, the Cats' promotions department has plans for a "Labor
Stoppage Night" in the event of a major league players' strike.
Pregnant fans will be admitted free.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who hit .400 in World Series play a record three
times?</TE>
<TE>   Shoe wars: LeBron James, who some NBA scouts say could become the
greatest basketball player since Michael Jordan, has triggered fierce
competition between shoe companies trying to sign the 17-year-old
Ohio prep star to an endorsement contract.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of the James sweepstakes will be "whoever comes to the
table with the best offer," James told the Bloomberg News Service. He
chuckled when asked if $5 million would be inducement enough. "I hear
that number, and it makes me smile," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Foul forecast: From Bud Geracie of the San Jose Mercury News: "San
Jose State's football team was picked to finish eighth in the Western
Athletic Conference, but that's not so bad. Last season's champ,
Louisiana Tech, was picked to finish ninth."</TE>
<TE>   Don't bet on it: A spokesman for the Phoenix Coyotes denied a
report in the Chicago Tribune stating that Wayne Gretzky, 41, a
minority owner with the Coyotes, has been preparing for a possible
return to the NHL as a player.</TE>
<TE>   "Wayne's been skating and playing pickup games this summer, but
that's just to help him stay and shape and feel better," Rich Nairn
told the Bloomberg News Service.</TE>
<TE>   A return to playing could be risky for Gretzky, who has two
herniated disks in his neck.</TE>
<TE>   Simple plan: Sean Keeler of the Des Moines (Iowa) Register
suggests two ways the Big Ten Conference can improve its football
profile:</TE>
<TE>   "1. Have your teams schedule at least one traditional leader or
contender from a power conference. 2. Beat them.</TE>
<TE>   "There. Was that so hard?"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Eddie Collins, in 1910 and 1913 with the
Philadelphia Athletics and in 1917 with the Chicago White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Television commentator Lee Corso, as usual, didn't
hold back when he addressed the problems facing the Southeastern
Conference at a college football kickoff luncheon in Atlanta. Two SEC
schools, Alabama and Kentucky, are on probation and three others,
Tennessee, Louisiana State and Mississippi State, are being
investigated for possible violations.</TE>
<TE>   "The national view is, the SEC cheats," Corso said. "Everybody's a
bunch of cheaters, a bunch of crooks. The SEC's got a public
relations problem. They better show they've got more than that."</TE>

<LD>The women and their children, newborns and toddlers, filed into the
Berkeley Community Theater on Saturday until more than 1,000 seats in
the large auditorium were filled.</LD>
<LD>   A folk singer crooned softly as city officials, including Mayor
Shirley Dean, prepared for the tally of nursing mothers and their
suckling children. Finally, city health worker Ellen Sirbu started
the countdown:</LD>
<LD>   "One, two, three--latch!" Sirbu, organizer of the first Berkeley
simultaneous breast-feeding rally, urged the assembled women.</LD>
<TE>   To the obvious relief of many sighing and cooing infants, the
mothers swung into action, assertively raising their loose-fitting
blouses and connecting child--and in some cases children--to their
life-supporting chests, the source of mother's milk and, from time
immemorial, the symbol of things good.</TE>
<TE>   "I could not be prouder that Berkeley is doing this," said a
beaming Dean, looking out at what had to be one of history's most
serene audiences. "Berkeley is used to taking the lead in these kinds
of health issues, and we are doing it again."</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, the women--some of whom came from as far away as
Texas and Wisconsin--had easily done what they set out to do.</TE>
<TE>   They broke a reported recent Australian world record for
simultaneously nursing mothers and--as network television cameras
zoomed in for close-ups--took a major step toward raising America's
consciousness about the many benefits of breast-feeding and the right
to nurse in public places.</TE>
<TE>   Top 10 Reasons</TE>
<TE>   One nursing mother carried a placard listing the top 10 reasons
for breast-feeding in public.</TE>
<TE>   The list began: "10) Because you are not at home. 9) Because your
breasts are ready to explode" and ended with "2) Because your baby is
hungry. 1) Because it is not illegal yet."</TE>
<TE>   Organizers hope the count of 1,128 simultaneously nursing mothers
Saturday will be recognized by the Guinness Book of Records and will
inspire other American cities to stage their own breast-feeding
challenges. Thus, the same city that launched the Free Speech
Movement and formed the vanguard in the 1960s anti-war movement might
also inspire other places to hold mass demonstrations of simultaneous
lactation.</TE>
<TE>   Mollie Peterson, 34, is a massage therapist from Santa Cruz,
mother of four children ages 10 years to 19 months.</TE>
<TE>   "All of them nursed, and all of them were home-birthed," said
Peterson. The results, she said, have been remarkable. "None of these
kids has ever been sick. And they are all really, really smart."</TE>
<TE>   As she spoke, the eclectic activities of a Berkeley Saturday
swirled around Peterson. On adjacent Allston Way, the Farmers Market,
featuring herb booths and stands selling mangoes impaled on sticks,
was in full swing. Up the street at the old Elks Building, the
Berkeley Psychic Institute was conducting its annual Psychic Faire &amp;
Spiritual healing festival.</TE>
<TE>   Emily Roysdon, 31, of Modesto said she came to the event to make a
point about the United States' backwardness in recognizing the
benefits of the practice.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. has an appallingly low breast-feeding rate," said
Roysdon, whose 4-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter are still
nursing. "This is to make people think about breast-feeding as a
normal thing."</TE>
<TE>   The nurse-in was organized by Sirbu, a Berkeley city nutritionist
who was inspired by similar mass "breastfests" in Australia, which
has one of the world's highest rates of nursing mothers.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a group of women at the South Australian Breastfeeding
Challenge in Adelaide reportedly set a record of 767 simultaneous
breast-feedings as part of World Breastfeeding Week.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make people aware that breast-feeding is the best
way to help baby, help yourself and help society," said Sirbu.
"There's even less pollution, because there are fewer cans of formula
in circulation."</TE>
<TE>   Recent studies have shown that women who nurse have a reduced
likelihood of breast cancer. Other studies show that children who are
breast-fed are less likely to become obese adults.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics on nursing are somewhat unreliable because they are
usually compiled when the mother leaves the hospital, and don't
reveal how long she continues breast-feeding. Nutritionists recommend
nursing for at least one year after birth.</TE>
<TE>   Cut in Cancer Risk Seen</TE>
<TE>   According to an article earlier this year in the medical journal
Lancet, women in developed countries would reduce national breast
cancer rates by 5% if they extended the average nursing period by six
months.</TE>
<TE>   According to La Leche League International, a leading promoter of
breast-feeding, about 68% of new mothers in the United States are
nursing when they leave the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, about 95% of Australian mothers are breast-feeding
when they go home. Japan and several Scandinavian countries, all with
national health-care systems that encourage breast-feeding, have
nursing rates of more than 90%.</TE>
<TE>   Despite laws in California and other states protecting the right
of mothers to breast-feed in public, nursing mothers still
occasionally face prejudice.</TE>
<TE>   In June, 70 breast-feeding mothers staged a nurse-in at the Santa
Monica Place mall after a 27-year-old El Segundo woman was told to
"cover up" by a security guard.</TE>
<TE>   In this respect, little has changed since Ellen Sirbu nursed her
two sons more than 30 years ago. "I remember nursing one of my boys
in a restaurant and being told to take him to the restroom," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Sirbu said, many Australian businesses display signs:
"Nursing Mothers Welcome Here."</TE>
<TE>   Of particular interest to the Berkeley organizers is increasing
the percentage of African American women and Latinas who nurse their
infants.</TE>
<TE>   According to Berkeley nursing event co-chairwoman Kelly Moore, who
directs a California Women, Infants and Children program in Oakland,
the highest rates of nursing mothers are among white, middle-class
women.</TE>
<TE>   Moore said the reverse is true among recent Latino immigrants who
come from cultures where the use of baby formula is considered a sign
of economic achievement.</TE>
<TE>   When she announced that the Bay Area women had broken the
Australian record Saturday, Sirbu urged them not to get smug.
"Australia has only 18 million people. We have 285 million, and we
have a long way to go to catch up. Next year I want to hold this in
the Oakland Coliseum."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials at the Huntington Library say they expect the
Amorphophallus titanum--known as the "corpse flower" or "stinky
plant" for its pungency--to bloom as early as this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   It would be the 12th time the flower has bloomed in North America,
the second time in California. Three years ago, when the Huntington's
flower bloomed, the 6-foot stinker drew 76,000 visitors. The odor is
attractive only to pollinating insects.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, the flower was 4 feet 5, an inch taller than the day
before. An outer layer was loosening, and a slight odor indicated
that the bloom, expected to last two days, may start today. The
museum will have special hours today through Tuesday. For hours and
more information, call the Flower Hotline at (800) 200-5566.</LD>

<HD>County Kids Go to Europe for a Song</HD>
<DH>Voice: Choir program, whose members recently left to
perform in England, gets strong reviews for its music and for
offering learning experiences.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Learning the words to the latest pop song may be a walk in the park
for most kids, but try asking them to sing it in German, Chinese or
Latin.</LD>
<LD>   For the 38 kids who make up the Ventura Master Chorale Children's
Concert Choir, learning to sing in different languages is just one of
many tasks.</LD>
<LD>   Their reward: Not only does the group of 9- to 16-year-olds get to
present concerts throughout the year in Ventura County, but they left
for Europe on July 29 to perform in the International Children's
Choir Festival, which ends Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   "You get to meet so many people from all over," 15-year-old
Stephanie Carr of Oxnard said before she left. "When we all sing
together, it sounds amazing."</TE>
<TE>   She and her brother, Scott, who have been in the choir for four
years, were part of the group that traveled to Italy for the group's
first international foray in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, the group is part of an eight-choir ensemble
from the United States performing in England at Canterbury Cathedral
and at London's Westminster Central Hall. Their program will range
from a work by 18th century composer William Boyce to a piece by
contemporary composer John Rutter.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura group, which was invited to perform, is led by Marcene
Camp Jardine, and is one of two choirs from California taking part.</TE>
<TE>   Burns Taft, director of the county's Master Chorale since 1980,
said the youths should learn a lot from the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "Marcene's group is very good--they wouldn't sing with the Master
Chorale if they weren't--but children need to hear other choirs,"
Taft said. "They can see what the standard is and they get validation
for what they are doing."</TE>
<TE>   Parents supply both emotional and financial support. The cost for
the trip is $2,200 per member, paid for in part through fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of children Marcene gets to go is really quite
impressive," Taft said. A large number of parents accompanied the
group.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the choir's 38 members, 27 went to England. Camp Jardine
said many of the members who didn't go are older and have summer
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Taft and choir accompanist Mary Canfield spearheaded the effort to
start a children's choir in Ventura. Taft said Camp Jardine was the
obvious choice to direct it because she combines a professional
singing background with 20 years of experience teaching music in
Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Camp Jardine said she never expected to be working
with kids.</TE>
<TE>   "I never played teacher as a child growing up," said Camp Jardine,
whose own singing background varied widely. "I just wanted to be the
best singer in the world, like so many others. I never thought I
would find myself immersed in kids, but I love it." Her teaching
style and love for what she is doing have made the weekly practices
fun for the young choir members.</TE>
<TE>   While most kids are spending their summers at the beach or going
to the movies, Stephanie said going to choir practice gives her a
chance to hang out with her friends.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like it would be a lot of work to learn all of the
songs, but for me it's something I really like to do," said
Stephanie, who will be a junior at La Reina High School in Thousand
Oaks. "I like to practice when I'm in the shower and when I'm in the
car. It gives me a break from my hectic life and I just flow through
it."</TE>
<TE>   Choir isn't the only extracurricular activity for Stephanie and
her 13-year-old brother; they have been taking piano and tennis
lessons since they were 3 years old. On top of that, she volunteers
at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura twice a week, and Scott
takes guitar lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom really pushes us not to sit around and watch TV, and
sometimes it can be kind of annoying," Scott said. "But she helps me
practice singing at home by playing the piano for me and my sister. I
try to practice at least twice a week on my own."</TE>
<TE>   In England, the choir will be performing a mix of contemporary and
classic songs.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to work hard to learn the music, but it's fun," said
10-year-old Allie Morris of Ventura, who is completing her first year
in the group.</TE>
<TE>   As a parent of two choir members, Ana Hernandez Carr said she is
happy her children are doing something they enjoy, but she looks
beyond the fun and views the choir as a wonderful opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "Culturally, it's an eye-opener for them," said Hernandez Carr,
who made the trek to Europe with her kids.</TE>
<TE>   Auditions for the choir are held in August and December. For more
information, contact Camp Jardine at 983-0913. Tuition is $110 per
semester.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to weekly practices, the choir performs a handful of
concerts each year. The next one is scheduled for December at the
Church of Religious Science in Ventura.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Vows to Increase Citizen Council Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving to stop defections to the secession movement, Mayor James K.
Hahn on Saturday reassured leaders of Los Angeles' fledgling
neighborhood councils that they will be given more say in city
budgeting and services.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing more than 600 activists at the city's first Congress of
Neighborhoods, Hahn announced the creation of a new Neighborhood Team
within his office to help expedite projects by neighborhood councils,
and pledged that the councils will be given a role in setting
priorities for the next city budget.</LD>
<LD>   "Today, I am asking you to partner with me in leading Los
Angeles," he said. "I believe our mission is simple: to improve Los
Angeles neighborhood by neighbor- hood."</LD>
<TE>   Hahn said in an interview that he sees the neighborhood council
system as the best alternative to Hollywood and San Fernando cityhood
measures on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important to reassure the people that they will have a
meaningful role," he said. "It's a real antidote to secession."</TE>
<TE>   The one-day conference at the Sheraton Universal Hotel provided
workshops on topics ranging from how to get action from city
bureaucrats to running council meetings.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd applauded when Valley Councilman Dennis Zine declared:
"We don't need to secede from the city of Los Angeles. We need to
find more success in the city of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   However, the event was held amid growing frustration in some
quarters that the city has been too slow in creating the councils and
that they lack decision-making power.</TE>
<TE>   Since a charter reform commission called for the councils three
years ago, 39 have been certified by the city and eight have held
community elections to fill out their ranks.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they actually are ahead of schedule, and that
70 councils may be in place by the end of the year, covering half of
the city.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the program has suffered some setbacks, including the
city's refusal to certify councils that would not adopt mandated
bylaws. And among the councils that have been certified, some members
have complained that they lack impact on city decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, more than half a dozen council organizers and
members have voiced support for secession as the best way to give
residents more say at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been very, very frustrated," said Rosa Martinez, an elected
member of the Central Hollywood Neighborhood Council. "Even though we
have worked hard to get organized, we do not have the power to do
much."</TE>
<TE>   She said city officials have hindered her group in its attempts to
address local problems, including an effort to eliminate a needle
exchange operation that the council believes attracts drug addicts to
the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Hollywood needs positive change, and cityhood will make a
big difference for residents," said Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Thompson was another disenchanted attendee at Saturday's
convention. She helped organize a neighborhood council in Granada
Hills but said the city has yet to certify the panel seven months
after an application was filed.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, a Hahn appointee to the city's Environmental Affairs
Commission, said she now supports secession and will seek a Valley
city council post.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists stood outside Saturday's conference and handed out
fliers that indicated they support neighborhood councils for the new
cities, but with decision-making power over land-use issues.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he understands the frustration, but that the councils
need time to reach their potential.</TE>
<TE>   He issued an executive directive in May to strengthen their role,
in part by requiring city managers to meet quarterly with the
councils to get input on services.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also increased the Department of Neighborhoods' budget
and set aside $3 million for grants to councils to spend on community
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Feyder of Harbor City and Richard Marshall of South Los
Angeles were two attendees who agreed with the mayor. Both said they
plan to vote against secession because they believe neighborhood
councils provide the closer citizen involvement that secessionists
promise without the potential problems of breaking up the city.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Gremer, president of the West Hills council, said the
mayor impressed his group by adopting its position against the
Ahmanson Ranch subdivision project after consulting the council.</TE>
<TE>   However, Gremer said the panel has otherwise had mixed success
since it was elected in May, with some city officials ignoring their
recommendations. So Gremer is voting for secession.</TE>
<TE>   "The neighborhood councils have only an advisory status," he said.
"It is only by the dint of personality and contacts that we get
anything done."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who later attended an anti-secession rally by city
firefighters, said he will work on convincing the likes of Gremer
that the councils are a better solution than secession.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that people are dismissing these things, but they are just
getting started and they have to be given a chance to work," Hahn
said.</TE>

<HD>Police Dog Platoon Owes a Lot to 'K-9 Mom'</HD>
<DH>Harriet Moffat, 94, has been a key benefactor of the LAPD's
program since its inception 22 years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nero, a 14-month-old Belgian Malinois, has a bite as bad as his bark.
He can track and take down an armed gunman, and without hesitation,
jump in front of a bullet to protect his handler.</LD>
<LD>   So, why is this canine--the quintessential police dog--playing
what looks like patty-cake with a pair of elderly women? Even worse,
he's licking their hands and acting like a silly puppy.</LD>
<LD>   "They're babies," said 94-year-old Harriet Moffat, the founder of
a fund to purchase dogs for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"They're my babies."</LD>
<TE>   Moffat, dubbed "K-9 Mom" by members of the LAPD's K-9 Platoon, is
as much a part of the elite team as any of the four-legged workers or
their handlers. For more than 20 years, she has had a hand in
purchasing almost every police dog in the department.</TE>
<TE>   "This unit is very special to me," said Moffat, while sitting on a
bench on the training grounds of the Los Angeles Police Academy in
Elysian Park. "It's grown a lot since I first started--from two dogs
to a team of 16 fearless dogs."</TE>
<TE>   The department's K-9 units began as a pilot program in April 1980
within the LAPD's West Bureau. Moffat, of Westwood, was a volunteer
in the department's West Los Angeles station and remembered talking
to the unit's first two officers and their dogs when they came to the
station for a class on the use of tear gas.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me it was a pilot program," she recalled. "They also
said it may not be around for a long time because there was not a lot
of money to be spending on dogs."</TE>
<TE>   Moffat took it upon herself to help the unit. Why? She loves dogs,
she loves law enforcement, and she thought it was a unique and useful
unit.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them I would help them get dogs," said Moffat. If the
department could train canine handlers, she said, "I knew I could get
the dogs."</TE>
<TE>   In the early years of the fund, Moffat raised money simply by
asking friends and businesses for donations. Most were happy to give.
Later, the fund was left a large bequest in a donor's will, which
sustained it for about 10 years. The fund now has tax-exempt status
and its eight-member board, which includes Moffat, is looking for
donations.</TE>
<TE>   When she launched the effort, Moffat was president of the West Los
Angeles Police Boosters Club. Its first goal was to buy just one dog.
She purchased a young German shepherd for a surprisingly inexpensive
$500. The dogs that the fund purchases now typically cost $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, the K-9 Fund has purchased about 50 dogs,
mainly German shepherds and Belgian Malinois, but also Rottweilers
and, recently, bloodhounds, which may start seeing action within a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, 16 dogs are on the squad, but it could still use more,
said Lt. Steve Zipperman, head of the unit.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, the dogs have been involved in more than 725
searches for felons and have posted a better than 50% capture rate,
Zipperman said. In years past, the dogs have been involved in as many
as 2,000 searches a year, said Sgt. Doug Roller, head trainer for the
unit, who met Moffat in the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "Without these dogs, our searches would be a lot more dangerous
and time-consuming," said Roller. "They basically cut our search
times by at least an hour, but more importantly, help save lives."</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Steve Groover, the senior member of the squad with 13 years
of K-9 experience, said he expects the squad to grow, especially
since the dogs are used on more assignments. Aside from the K-9
Platoon, the LAPD's bomb squad and narcotics units have their own
teams of dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the dogs have been used in major events, such as
the North Hollywood bank shootout in 1997, but usually are called on
to hunt down a single robber, burglar or other criminal.</TE>
<TE>   "These dogs work every day," said Groover.</TE>
<TE>   Moffat enjoys hearing police and canine stories. She visits the
dogs, but she admits it has become more difficult with age.</TE>
<TE>   When Moffat arrives at the police academy, trainers and officers
greet her with smiles and hugs. The veteran sergeants and lieutenants
have known her for years. Some made trips to Germany with her to
purchase five young dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "She's been very instrumental to the growth of this department,"
said Officer James McConnell, who is Nero's handler and is in his
first year with the squad.</TE>
<TE>   "Without her, there's no telling what would have become of this
unit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As McConnell trained with his dog, Moffat watched from her bench,
joined by Elizabeth Peeples of West Los Angeles, another supporter of
the K-9 squad.</TE>
<TE>   Through her contributions, Peeples, 80, has helped purchase three
dogs and a horse for the mounted police squad.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I owe it to the Police Department," said Peeples, retired
from the motion picture industry. "They put their lives on the line
for us. I think I should give something back."</TE>
<TE>   Moffat has watched the dogs train during the 14 weeks of
obedience, agility, tracking and officer protection training that
will ultimately determine if the dogs have what it takes to wear a
badge.</TE>
<TE>   However, she still does not truly understand what makes a police
dog.</TE>
<TE>   "They smell fear, but they are not in fear," she said. "I know
it's something with the criminal's sweat."</TE>
<TE>   The stories of bravery are many, said Moffat. Police dogs have
been shot, stabbed, thrown off buildings and hit with baseball bats.</TE>
<TE>   One such story was that of Liberty, a talented Rottweiler who was
shot to death a few years ago by a murder suspect. Even while
mortally wounded, she continued to protect her handler, who also had
been shot.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty is one of five police dogs killed in the line of duty. She
ended her career with about 250 searches and 103 arrests in her two
years on the squad.</TE>
<TE>   "These dogs are incredible," Moffat said. "These dogs are smarter
than some people I know."</TE>

<HD>Students Sample a Fruitful Harvest</HD>
<DH>Leadership: Children of migrant farm workers are schooled
in the value of a college education.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are the children of a new harvest, one expected to shape the
lives of the next generation of migrant workers.</LD>
<LD>   Through a series of workshops and lectures, the children of
migrant farm workers learned the inside story of their world and the
impact they could have if they finish college.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, 146 high school sophomores and juniors graduated from
the UCLA Migrant Student Leadership Institute in a ceremony that
pounded home one point--si se puede ("yes, we can").</LD>
<TE>   They were the second group to graduate from the institute this
summer. The first, made up of only high school juniors, spent a month
taking classes at UCLA, earning college credit.</TE>
<TE>   During Saturday's commencement, the students occupied most of the
first eight rows of an auditorium in UCLA's Moore Hall. Their
parents, many holding cameras, listened as organizers recapped the
weeks' lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "This program is the parents," Larry Jaurequi, director of the
Migrant Education office, told the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous times, the students broke into a "migrant clap," a burst
of short claps that begins slowly, then picks up speed and force.
Farm workers have used it to motivate each other for hundreds of
years, UCLA professor Kris Gutierrez said.</TE>
<TE>   To add emphasis, Cal State Los Angeles professor Carlos Tejeda
contrasted the average life expectancy of workers in the U.S.--76
years--versus that of migrant farm workers: 49.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers were sobering, Zarmina Gorsi said. Her parents,
originally from Pakistan, have worked in the orchards around Yuba
City for the last 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   She said the institute made her realize the importance of helping
other students and workers. "If I don't make a difference, nobody
will," Gorsi said.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Quevedo, 67, a migrant farm-working parent who has helped
run the program for years, said he has learned the value of education
over the decades of hunching in the sun or reaching high for crops.
There was a time when he plucked his children out of class to help in
the fields as easily as he plucked oranges in the San Joaquin Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed the money.... But eventually the importance of
education sunk into our consciousness," Quevedo said. "The only way
to liberate our children from the oppression of others and from poor
wages was with education."</TE>
<TE>   With its migrant worker spirit, it's no surprise that the program
tries to instill in the students an activist spirit, a willingness to
question rules and unjust practices. Institute graduates said
Saturday that they would encourage more students back home to apply
for the program.</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo Vieyra's parents work the strawberry fields near Oxnard.
He was the only student from his high school to attend the institute
this year. He said it would be his mission to recruit more students
next year.</TE>
<TE>   As they were eating lunch, Vieyra thanked his parents for their
support.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of commencement, Tejeda told the students to stand and
face their parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Students," he said, "the situation of immigrants and migrant
workers is not going to change if you don't change it."</TE>
<TE>   Spontaneously, parents and children acknowledged one another the
best way they knew how. They filled the auditorium with a migrant
clap.</TE>

<HD>Bitter Legacy of 1977 Is Eased</HD>
<DH>Development: New life comes to a site left empty since the
eviction of 55 Asian Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>After 25 years, Bill Sorro still shakes with anger over the night
they drove old Manilatown down, beginning with the 3 a.m. eviction of
55 elderly Filipino and Chinese tenants of the International Hotel.</LD>
<LD>   Sorro recalls how police in riot gear clubbed their way through a
tangle of 5,000 protesters outside the residence hotel that served as
the emotional center of the city's Filipino community of World War II
veterans who worked in the fields and fish canneries throughout
Northern California.</LD>
<LD>   And he can still see those frail but defiant old Manongs, Filipino
retirees in their 60s and 70s with hats and jackets pulled up against
the early morning chill, demanding to know why they were being dumped
onto the street.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the old men are dead now, said Sorro, a longtime Filipino
activist. And so is Manilatown, its residents scattered after the
venerable "I-Hotel"--the city's last Filipino cultural
stronghold--was demolished in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   But with a wicked grin, Sorro said big business hadn't won after
all. The firm that owned the hotel had hoped to replace it with a
high-rise. It never happened.</TE>
<TE>   For 25 years, the valuable site remained a bottle-strewn,
fenced-off crater half a block long as city officials and activists
vetoed any development plan that lacked low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   Now, on the 25th anniversary of those evictions in the pre-dawn
hours of Aug. 4, 1977, bulldozers rumble across the Kearny Street lot
on Chinatown's eastern edge, carving the foundation for a $40-million
project that will include a 105-unit senior housing development, a
religious school complex and a Manilatown museum.</TE>
<TE>   The unlikely turnabout came after years of tedious negotiations
involving the Roman Catholic archdiocese and various government
agencies and civic groups, including an I-Hotel Citizens Advisory
Committee composed of Asian-community leaders. In the end, they were
able to buy the land from owners in Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   But for Sorro, the so-called victory remains bittersweet.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask: 'Do you feel vindicated?' " said Sorro, a 62-year-old
father of six who once lived at the I-Hotel. "... And our response
is, 'Hell, no. Hell, no.' An entire community was destroyed, and that
can never be brought back. They ran people out of their homes under
the guise of progress. The ghosts of those displaced old men will
never forget that."</TE>
<TE>   But the saga of the I-Hotel was a watershed event in
landlord-tenant relations. The incident galvanized the Bay Area's
Asian community, where the elderly are revered, and inspired an
unprecedented surge of Asian American activism.</TE>
<TE>   The evictions also became a national symbol of urban dislocation
that prompted changes in city housing codes--moving the issue of
affordable housing to center stage in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The episode led to a law banning conversions of residential
hotels, paved the way for other eviction controls and halted the
development march that many say would have overrun today's Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the city passed legislation requiring that all single
room occupancy hotels be equipped with fire sprinklers.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a classic David and Goliath battle where David got his
clock cleaned," said Supervisor Aaron Peskin, whose district includes
Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   "But Asian activists not only lived to fight another day, they
changed the relationship between landlords and tenants throughout the
entire city. I'd call that a resounding victory."</TE>
<TE>   The I-Hotel struggle set the ground rules for a new era of
community activism. "Like other young radicals of the day, I cried
the night they took those old men out of that hotel," said the Rev.
Norman Fong, a program director at the nonprofit Chinatown Community
Development Center.</TE>
<TE>   "But we learned that, to win the battle, we had to become more
tactical. The developers won through technicalities. They went to the
courts and called out the lawyers. We vowed that was never going to
happen again."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1940s, Manilatown stretched for 10 blocks along Kearny
Street, an enclave of barbershops, restaurants and pool halls with
the I-Hotel at its center.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years later, the ramshackle 152-room structure was among
the few remaining residence hotels where, for a retired Asian
immigrant, the $50 monthly rent purchased a sense of community along
with a private room.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel sat at the edge of the fast-encroaching financial
district and, by the late 1960s, the wrecking ball had already
demolished scores of Manilatown businesses. The I-Hotel's turn came
in 1969 when real estate tycoon Walter Shorenstein announced plans to
tear down the hotel and build a parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   For the next eight years, as the case dragged through the courts,
the hotel became a focus for students mobilized by the Vietnam War
and civil rights struggles. With the cry of "No evictions! We won't
go!" they joined with liberal politicians, union leaders and radical
groups such as the Black Panthers as advocates for the elderly
immigrants who lived there.</TE>
<TE>   "The movement signaled the resurgence of the Asian American left,"
said Warren Mar, a labor specialist at UC Berkeley who grew up near
the hotel. "Inspired by the Black Panthers, the Asian radicals were
the ones who organized."</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, Shorenstein sold the hotel to a company owned by Supacit
Mahaguna, a Bangkok investor.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, when Mahaguna's Four Seas Investment Corp. won
an eviction order, the city tried to use the right of eminent domain
to seize the hotel and sell it to the tenants. When a judge denied
the motion, thousands of protesters jammed Kearny Street and kept a
24-hour watch to guard against the court-ordered eviction.</TE>
<TE>   Police said bombs and automatic weapons were being held at the
hotel--claims that protesters denied.</TE>
<TE>   The residents won a brief reprieve when San Francisco County
Sheriff Richard Hongisto refused to carry out the eviction order. But
after serving five days in jail for contempt, Hongisto relented,
setting the stage for one of the largest one-day evictions in state
history.</TE>
<TE>   Emil De Guzman, a Filipino activist who lived at the I-Hotel,
recalled the morning of Aug. 4 when he heard the stomp of 300 police
officers and sheriff's deputies arriving.</TE>
<TE>   "They were like the Roman legions coming down at us," said De
Guzman, who now works as a housing investigator and mediator for the
city's Human Rights Commission. "They were marching in formation,
many on horseback. We were under siege."</TE>
<TE>   With thousands of protesters screaming for them to stop, police
used ladders to scale the hotel, climbing over activists to enter
through a higher floor. In a picture that ran in newspapers
nationwide, Hongisto used a sledgehammer to batter the front door.</TE>
<TE>   De Guzman said officers dragged him from the hotel by his shirt
and hair.</TE>
<TE>   A documentary filmed that night shows Hongisto telling an elderly
Filipino man: "It's time to go. You're being evicted."</TE>
<TE>   "Later come back?" the man asks in broken English.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think so," Hongisto responds. "You can't come back."</TE>
<TE>   Hongisto now says he's proud of activists for preserving the
I-Hotel site, but complains that he is remembered for taking the
first blow against a hotel he tried to save.</TE>
<TE>   "In retrospect, I feel utterly stupid for taking that sledgehammer
to the door," he said. "I should have realized how misunderstood that
act would be."</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks after the evictions, a series of unsolved terrorist
bombings rocked the city's opera house, a posh Knob Hill restaurant
and the home of a director of a firm that had once owned the I-Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Anonymous letters called for the return of the tenants to the
hotel.</TE>
<TE>   But soon the I-Hotel was leveled. Over the next quarter-century,
the ruins remained an uncomfortable reminder of failure for locals.
Several times, members of the Asian American community, backed by
city officials, tried unsuccessfully to buy the site.</TE>
<TE>   Then, several years ago, the company agreed to sell to a group led
by the Catholic archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "They realized that nothing was going to happen on that property
unless a nonprofit took over," said the Rev. Daniel E. McCotter,
director of St. Mary's Chinese Schools.</TE>
<TE>   The development project, due to be completed in 2005, will include
Catholic elementary and Chinese-language schools, an underground
garage and a tea house designed for the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   Also included will be the 105-unit International Hotel Senior
Housing, funded by the city and by a federal Housing and Urban
Development grant. The first floor will house the Manilatown Heritage
Foundation and museum.</TE>
<TE>   In a gesture that thrills activists, the building's floors will be
named after former I-Hotel residents.</TE>
<TE>   "People might ask, 'How could you let such a prime piece of real
estate sit vacant for so long?' " Mar said. "... But that's the only
way to beat developers and get something good done. Maybe more sites
should remain holes in the ground for a few decades."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Sorro says the site will always remain a symbol of those
lost.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wound in this community's heart, but it was never just an
empty hole. It was always full of the love of those old men who once
lived there," said the retired community organizer.</TE>

<HD>Hutton Leaving After 24 Years as Surf City's Counsel</HD>
<DH>Government: Her tenure saw oil, beaches, hotels and a
councilman's scandal on the agenda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gail Hutton, a fixture at Huntington Beach City Hall for 24 years as
city attorney, will retire in September, two months before her
elected term expires.</LD>
<LD>   The 65-year-old Hutton is leaving early to take advantage of a
"golden handshake" retirement package that sweetens her pension
benefits.</LD>
<LD>   The city, which is facing a $6-million budget deficit, is offering
such deals to about 40 employees to reduce its payroll costs.</LD>
<TE>   Hutton's long career as the city's top legal counsel was somewhat
tarnished toward the end by the scandal involving former Councilman
Dave Garofalo, who pleaded guilty in January to one felony and 15
misdemeanor counts of violating state conflict-of-interest laws. She
said she has considered leaving for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I've served a long time, and I just feel that there are other
challenges in life that I would like to entertain," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she might apply to the American Bar Assn.'s Eastern
European legal advisory program, which sends lawyers to former Soviet
bloc countries, which are trying to democratize and institute
free-market economies.</TE>
<TE>   "As a lawyer with 30 years of experience, I think I have something
to offer," Hutton said.</TE>
<TE>   Hutton, whose new, Russian-born husband, Andrei Safirov, is a
retired professor of political science and history, regularly travels
to his homeland to lecture, sometimes staying for several months.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult for us sometimes," Hutton said. They've been
married 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Shirley S. Dettloff said that after six four-year
terms in office, Hutton deserves the chance to retire.</TE>
<TE>   "She's been re-elected every time, which means the majority of the
residents of Huntington Beach are supportive of the work that she's
done. That alone is a tribute to her."</TE>
<TE>   The council will decide during its meeting Monday whether to keep
Hutton on as a consultant until her term expires, or have a deputy or
outsider fill out the term.</TE>
<TE>   Hutton, the only independently elected city attorney in Orange
County, said she is proud of her legacy, having helped negotiate
contracts and settlements that led to closing the oil fields in the
Sea Cliff area, cleaning up the city's beaches and bringing two major
hotels to the waterfront.</TE>
<TE>   But her legacy is also certain to be tainted by the Garofalo
scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Garofalo, as councilman and mayor, voted on city projects that
involved advertisers in his local newspaper and the city's annual
Visitors Guide, which he also published. He was found guilty of
repeatedly voting on matters that required him to abstain. In
addition to a fine, he was given a suspended sentence and placed on
three years' unsupervised probation.</TE>
<TE>   During the 17-month investigation into Garofalo's actions,
Hutton's critics said she did not aggressively investigate the
charges against him, and was slow in referring questions about his
votes to the state's Fair Political Practices Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Hutton defended her actions, saying Garofalo did not fully
disclose his involvement with the advertisers to her.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a low point when your council member gives you information
that isn't accurate and you try to fashion an opinion based on [that
information]," Hutton said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she looks forward to spending time with her husband and
traveling.</TE>
<TE>   But, she said, "I have three adult children and seven
grandchildren in Southern California, so you can be sure I will spend
the bulk of my time here."</TE>

<HD>Out on the Town With S.Lo, Where Hipness Is a State of Mind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In many ways, S.Lo is no different from other grunts in Southern
California. At quitting time, I enjoy checking out the night life,
and the possibilities in downtown L.A. are growing as we speak.</LD>
<LD>   Just last week, after an exhausting day trying to figure out what
possessed Bill "Simple" Simon to run for governor, I met up with the
lovely and talented Alison for cocktails at 5th and Flower. The
Standard Hotel is in, and if you haven't heard about it, you're not.
Patrons wait in line behind a velvet rope as staffers wearing radio
earpieces give them the once-over.</LD>
<LD>   S.Lo generally doesn't go anyplace where the staff uses a
radio-alert system, which should only be worn by Secret Service
agents. But being S.Lo, man about town, carries certain
responsibilities.</LD>
<TE>   "Is that what you're wearing?" asked Alison, reminding me that the
Standard's rooftop bar is a hipster scene.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, that's what I'm wearing. I was going to pick up a pair of the
new low-rise jeans for men, but I didn't have time.</TE>
<TE>   She shook her head.</TE>
<TE>   The first indication of trouble was that the hotel sign was hung
upside down. I have left many a bar thinking the sign was upside
down, but it's never happened on the way in.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of pretense was apparent even before the Standard opened
in May. Gary Leonard says he was shooting pictures for the Downtown
News when the hotel staff ordered him to hand over his film. Leonard
refused, saying he was on public property, and besides, all he did
was photograph the new hotel furniture as it was hauled off a truck.</TE>
<TE>   The mild-mannered Leonard says he was shuttled into the hotel
basement and held against his will by a posse of junior crime-busters
communicating through radio earpieces. Apparently the Standard did
not want to let out the big secret on the Jetsons motif, and photos
in the Downtown News would have been catastrophic.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard, 51, says he made a break for the door.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop him!" cried the chief goon, who wore an expensive suit and a
styled hairdo, according to Leonard.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard worked his way back onto the street, but the security team
kept him on a tight leash. He tried to flag down a passing cop, then
played a cat-and-mouse game with his captors, moving up and down the
sidewalk as they followed.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard was finally returned to freedom and promptly filed a
police complaint. He's now waiting to hear whether the city attorney
will prosecute. Not to digress, but S.Lo wants to go on the record
recommending long prison sentences for everyone involved.</TE>
<TE>   "They were overzealous and it shouldn't have happened," admits the
hotel owner, Andre Balazs, who called S.Lo from New York. He said
he's still trying to get hold of Leonard to apologize.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, no hard feelings. S.Lo loves the night life, and could
already taste his first drink. I got to the Standard kind of early,
so there was no velvet rope to deal with. You take a quick elevator
ride to the roof, and when the doors slide open, you're in another
galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   The open-air bar has a terrific skyline view and sort of a '70s
rec-room motif, complete with Astroturf, love seats and a DJ who
looks like Elvis on fen-phen. The waitresses wear lollipop-red
car-hop get-ups with knee socks, and over by the infinity pool is a
cluster of candy apple pods with water beds inside. I'm almost
certain I saw Austin Powers in one of them.</TE>
<TE>   As you might have suspected by now, this is a place where
everybody inspects everyone else, unlike a proper bar such as the one
at Taylor's Prime Steaks, where people just stare into the bottom of
their glass. Moving about the place was like walking the red carpet
at the Oscars, and I did my best to hide a slight limp. You don't
want to be the only yutz at a hipster convention with fallen arches
and sciatica.</TE>
<TE>   But I did see a handful of customers who, like S.Lo, were born
before the Kennedy administration. And it's nice to see anyone
downtown at night, even if they're sporting pierced eyelids, green
mohawks and tattoos the size of freeway murals.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, that woman has a duct-tape head band," Alison said.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, and I wanted to borrow some of it to seal a few yaps shut.
S.Lo has a low tolerance for the twentysomething inflection that
turns every declarative sentence into a question.</TE>
<TE>   They'll be, like talking?</TE>
<TE>   And I'm ready to, throttle them?</TE>
<TE>   So I was sitting there and next thing I knew, this young twit
practically knocked the lovely and talented Alison off her chair so
she could stub out her cigarette at our table.</TE>
<TE>   Now we've got trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Alison, who suffers no fool lightly, bolted up and went after the
offending party. I had visions of an all-points radio alert, with the
Standard's crack security team swarming in and herding Mrs. S.Lo into
the basement detention facility.</TE>
<TE>   Just in the nick of time, a friend named Bill appeared out of
nowhere, stepping between Alison and her prey in the instant before
she committed a felony.</TE>
<TE>   "Alison?"</TE>
<TE>   "Bill?"</TE>
<TE>   Crisis averted.</TE>
<TE>   I ordered another round of drinks and glanced about the room, and
maybe it was the liquor, or maybe it was the summer night air
(probably the liquor), but it started to feel just fine on the roof
of downtown L.A. Had I worn the low-rise jeans, S.Lo, man about town,
would have owned the scene.</TE>

<HD>9 Stolen Exotic Birds Could Die</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine costly exotic birds stolen from a West Hollywood pet shop were
still missing Saturday, their need for special care making it
unlikely they would survive if they were not found today, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   The missing birds, including a 4-foot-tall hyacinth macaw valued
at $18,000, were taken from their cages about 4:30 a.m. Friday by
thieves who used dog sweaters to grip the feathered bodies and
transfer them to a sack, said Fernando Nuno, co-owner of the Amazon
Rainforest Pet Shop on Santa Monica Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   "The birds are my life. I don't know how this can happen," said
Nuno, who had bred many of the birds himself. "We just want the birds
to get back to their homes."</LD>
<TE>   Nuno said some of the birds could die within three days if they
were not hand-fed a special formula.</TE>
<TE>   The authorities have gathered evidence showing that more than one
person took the birds, said Sgt. Bruce Thomas of the West Hollywood
sheriff's station.</TE>
<TE>   The thieves must have known the birds' value, Nuno said, because
only the most expensive ones were taken. An employee discovered the
theft Friday morning, Nuno said. The back gate had been bent and the
alarm system disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the hyacinth--whose name is Rio and, at 13 months, has
learned a few phrases, such as "Goodbye" and "How are you?"--the
thieves took three umbrella cockatoos, a rose breast cockatoo, two
Durbian parrots, an Amazon yellow nape and a Goaphen cockatoo named
Lucky, Nuno said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the birds, including Rio and Lucky, belonged to
celebrities who boarded their pets there while away on movie shoots,
Nuno said. Others, such as the three umbrella cockatoos, had been
sold but were living at the store until they were old enough to eat
on their own.</TE>
<TE>   One of those birds was to be delivered Friday to a man planning to
give it to his wife for her birthday, Nuno said. She had already
visited the bird several times and begun bonding with it.</TE>

<HD>Cutting Off Fuel for Fires</HD>
<DH>Safety: Sequoia forest officials seek more funds to reduce
risk of infernos by thinning growth and setting controlled burns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST</DL>
<LD>Fires are like people. They need to breathe and eat. For two weeks a
sprawling wildfire has been feasting on a rugged patch of the
southern Sierra, periodically threatening some of the world's
grandest trees.</LD>
<LD>   But don't blame the McNally blaze, named after a roadside cafe
near the fire's origin, on environmentalists or the spotted owl or
any other form of wildlife that thrives in dense timber--the favorite
culprits in this summer of flames across the West.</LD>
<LD>   The steep, brushy slopes of the Kern River Canyon that stoked the
blaze to blast-furnace intensity is not owl, or even timber country
and never has been.</LD>
<TE>   The wildfire, now approaching 100,000 acres, began as a campfire
and gorged on chaparral because the weather was hot, dry and
windy--and because much of the harsh terrain had not burned for
decades, or in some places, for more than a century.</TE>
<TE>   And if anything has kept the U.S. Forest Service from taking some
of that fuel out of the canyon--setting prescribed fires and thinning
the brush and smaller trees that fires consume like candy--it has
been weather and limited funding.</TE>
<TE>   Fire management officers in the Sequoia say 30% to 40% of this 1.2
million-acre forest east of Bakersfield needs work to reduce fuels,
either by thinning or controlled burns or a combination.</TE>
<TE>   If they had the money, forest officials say, they could treat
about 12,000 acres a year. They've been averaging somewhat more than
half that amount since the mid-1990s. This year they are only getting
enough money to treat 1,400 acres.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all dollar driven," said Brent Skaggs, deputy forest fire
management officer for the Sequoia. "If we can get more money, we can
do more acres."</TE>
<TE>   A youthful-looking 40, Skaggs has been fighting fires and
performing fuel-reduction work in the Sequoia for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Last week on the western flank of the McNally blaze, where it has
been largely contained, he took stock.</TE>
<TE>   The fire never got to many of the areas that crews have burned or
thinned in recent years, stopping just to the east. But in some
cases, firefighters used the prescribed burns to help establish a
successful line of defense against the advancing inferno.</TE>
<TE>   And at French Joe Meadow, one of Skaggs' projects helped keep the
flames out of nearby Packsaddle Grove, one of the 11 concentrations
of giant sequoias that the fire threatened in its first week but
never entered.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence was dramatic. On one side of a dirt road, the fire
had raced up a steep slope thick with pines and manzanita bushes.
Most were dead, charred sticks standing in several inches of gray
ash. On the other side of the road, where Forest Service crews had
thinned and burned a few years ago, the trees were green and very
much alive. The McNally blaze stopped at the road, unable to
establish itself on the treated land.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk about an area that can take a wildfire--this is it," Skaggs
said proudly as he glanced around. "I feel pretty good about this
work."</TE>
<TE>   The French Joe project was designed to protect both the Packsaddle
Grove, about a mile away, and Johnsondale, an old logging camp and
mill community reincarnated as a recreational vehicle park that lies
several miles northeast.</TE>
<TE>   Logged in the 1930s, the land around French Joe is dotted with
large, weathered tree stumps. The area had grown thick after the
timber cut because there was no wildfire to clear out young trees and
brush, and no thinning work until Skaggs' crew took on the job in the
late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the last century, the federal government did all it
could to suppress wildfire, extinguishing the natural cycle of
low-intensity fires that historians believe were once common in
Western forests and routinely eliminated the brush and small trees
that kindle today's wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   About half of the 2,200-acre French Joe project was thinned, and
later controlled burns were set. Smaller trees--up to about two
pencil lengths in diameter--were cut along with brush to create
18-foot openings on the forest floor.</TE>
<TE>   The size of trees removed can be the most controversial aspect of
thinning projects on national forest land, with environmentalists
complaining that the cuts are a ruse for commercial timbering that
targets the biggest, most fire-resistant trees.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of French Joe Meadow, the trees removed were far
smaller than those logged in the 1930s, and Skaggs said
environmentalists did not object.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really weird to see a truck with 30 to 40 [logs] on it,"
he said, comparing the sight with a full-blown commercial timber cut,
in which logs would be of such size that only about half a dozen
would fit on a truck.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some of the trees thinned in the French Joe project were
large enough for lumber production. An area mill, which has been
retooled to handle smaller logs, bought them and hauled them down to
the Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The success of the French Joe project notwithstanding, thinning
and controlled burns do not fireproof the forest, nor are they
intended to.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, we have so much country out there out of the natural
fire cycle that fire is going to get into these systems one way or
the other," said Bill Jackson, a Forest Service fire behavior analyst
who came from Arizona to help battle the McNally blaze.</TE>
<TE>   But the treatments can slow fires and keep them from getting so
ferociously hot that nothing is left in their wake but black death.</TE>
<TE>   The McNally flames ran through areas the Forest Service had
treated with prescribed burns a decade or more ago, but the fire
clearly lost some of its intensity. South of Johnsondale, Skaggs
pointed to a small ridge and creek bed where controlled burns had
been conducted in the early 1990s. Much of it was blackened. But
there was also green, signaling trees that would survive.</TE>
<TE>   A larger spot north of Johnsondale had been commercially logged in
the mid-1970s and then subjected to a controlled burn. Brush had
since grown thick enough for the Forest Service to mark it as a spot
ripe for treatment. According to Skaggs, "our analysis showed this
was a bomb ready to go off."</TE>
<TE>   It did. When the fire leaped through, it charred much of the area.
But again, there was scattered green.</TE>
<TE>   Major wildfires all over the West this summer have poured gasoline
on a decades-old fight over the management of national forests.
Conservatives and the timber industry are pointing the finger at
environmentalists and a steep decline in logging on public land that
occurred during the Clinton administration. The critics argue that
environmental appeals have been blocking logging contracts that would
thin the forests.</TE>
<TE>   A few days ago, a group of Western senators, all Republicans
except Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California, announced their
support for a forest management plan that could bypass appeals and
lengthy judicial reviews.</TE>
<TE>   But in the Sequoia at least, things are not so black and white.
Forest supervisor Art Gaffrey said that, although there is an ongoing
environmental lawsuit and there have been appeals of some thinning
projects in recent years, the litigation has not halted work. Nor he
said, are new environmental protections for the Sierra Nevada
preventing him from reducing the forest fuel buildup near
communities.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't found it productive to try to place blame," Gaffrey
said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest challenges in conducting prescribed burns, he
added, is the weather. There are too few days when the wind and
temperature and humidity all come together to create safe burn
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Money is another issue. According to Skaggs, carrying out thinning
and controlled burns on 12,000 acres a year in the Sequoia--the
amount fire managers would like to treat--would require $4 million a
year.</TE>
<TE>   The most ever treated in a single year in the Sequoia was 10,000
acres. The acreage was thinned or burned last year with $2.4 million
in extra funding given by Congress in conjunction with creation of
the Giant Sequoia National Monument on the forest's western side.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the fuels-reduction budget for the entire forest will
be $1 million, enough to treat only about 1,400 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Williams, a fire management officer in the Sequoia, warned
that after more than a century of being denied its natural urge to
clean house with frequent, low-intensity fires, "the forest up here
is screaming to burn."</TE>
<TE>   It's not enough to remove brush and small trees, he said; the
forest needs prescribed burns as well. "Whatever you want to call
it--thinning, logging--and prescribed burning. That's our preference.
Don't just thin and walk away from it."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest lesson of McNally is that the forest will
burn--if not on human terms, then on its own.</TE>

<HD>Bond Would Buy Out Developers</HD>
<DH>Election: Owners of environmentally sensitive parcels
support Prop. 50, which would give state millions to purchase their
property.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The campaign for a massive statewide water bond measure is being
bankrolled by developers who could reap hundreds of millions of
dollars selling environmentally sensitive land to the state should it
pass in November.</LD>
<LD>   Donors, who have spent more than a million dollars to qualify and
promote Proposition 50 since January, include owners of parcels
linked to the Bolsa Chica and Ballona Creek wetlands who have been
battling environmentalists over their plans for development for
years, even decades.</LD>
<LD>   Another is a Las Vegas land speculator who recently bought 2,000
acres of hillsides and rugged mountains above Malibu--land long
coveted by the National Park Service and the Santa Monica Mountains
Conservancy.</LD>
<TE>   If approved by a majority of voters, Proposition 50 would let the
state issue $3.4 billion in bonds to restore coastal wetlands and
watersheds and expand drinking water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   About $750 million of that could be used to buy coastal parcels,
with the Bolsa Chica mesa in Huntington Beach specifically cited in
the proposition.</TE>
<TE>   Other regions mentioned as priorities are the San Francisco Bay
Area, the Santa Monica Mountains and Baldwin Hills near Culver City.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with four development companies either did not return
telephone calls or declined to comment on their donations to the
pro-Proposition 50 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   However, a Southern California developer who asked not to be named
said, "It makes perfect sense: All those projects are being
tormented; if you don't want us to build, buy the property."</TE>
<TE>   No serious opposition has emerged to the measure, apart from the
routine objections of anti-tax groups.</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists, environmental activists and residents concerned
about development in their midst are ecstatic at the prospect of
preserving so much coveted land.</TE>
<TE>   Some, however, are wary of developers' involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "The foxes are clearly in the henhouse on this initiative," said
Mark Massara, coastal programs director for the Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are obviously working to enhance their own bottom line
and profit on this real estate speculation," Massara said.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] as someone who fights all these battles, it's cheaper to
buy [the lands] now than spend the next 25 years fighting."</TE>
<TE>   The bond measure--backed by the Nature Conservancy, the National
Audubon Society, the Planning and Conservation League and others--is
aimed primarily at raising billions of dollars to increase and
safeguard drinking water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   That is also a vital issue for developers, who under state law now
must identify a water supply for their projects.</TE>
<TE>   Soliciting Support</TE>
<TE>   Ballot measure organizer and lobbyist Joe Caves said that he has
talked to developers about supporting the measure and has told them,
"If they want to have the option of [their land] being purchased by
the state, these bonds have to pass."</TE>
<TE>   As of July 31, Playa Capital has given $830,000 to the measure's
primary backer, the Conservation Action Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The company is building a 1,087-acre development near the Ballona
wetlands on Los Angeles' Westside. Attempts to reach officials
familiar with the contribution were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Sweeney, who recently bought the scenic land above Malibu,
has contributed nearly $25,000 to the California Conservation
Campaign, another key Proposition 50 backer. Through his attorney, he
declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Sam Farr (D-Carmel) has accused Sweeney of "environmental
terrorism" because he has a history of buying land, securing
development rights and then selling the land to the state and
nonprofit groups for many times what he paid for it.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co. donated $30,000 directly to the "Yes on 50"
campaign, and gave an additional $55,000 to the Conservation Action
Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The San Juan Co., an affiliate of Rancho Mission Viejo, also gave
$50,000 to "Yes on 50."</TE>
<TE>   Developers Benefit</TE>
<TE>   Neither of the two major Orange County landholders appears to have
property that would be acquired using bond funds. But they, like all
developers, would benefit from new sources of drinking water. Also,
both companies historically have been active in state and local
politics.</TE>
<TE>   "We report our contributions, [but] as a matter of policy, we
don't publicly discuss them," Irvine Co. spokesman John Christensen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bixby Ranch Co. of Seal Beach has contributed $20,000 to the
California Conservation Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The state has targeted 181 acres of wetlands it wants to buy from
the company, and anticipates chipping in $14 million for part of the
cost.</TE>
<TE>   No funding source has been identified. The company did not respond
to requests for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Signal Landmark, which owns the Bolsa Chica mesa, has donated
$350,000 to both the Conservation Action Fund and the California
Conservation Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "As a company, we've got a long track record of supporting good
public policy," said Lucy Dunn, executive vice president of
Hearthside Homes, Signal's sister company. Dunn declined comment on
the acquisition issue.</TE>
<TE>   Although it appears that landowners who could sell their
environmentally sensitive property are backing the measure,
developers are not of a single mind about Proposition 50.</TE>
<TE>   "In the building and development industry as a whole, folks are
coming down on all sides," said David Smith, legal counsel for the
Building Industry Assn. of Southern California. "While Prop. 50 does
make some provision for [drinking water] supply, it avoids the
long-term storage [reservoir] issue."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Fulton, a regional planning consultant who publishes the
California Planning and Development Report newsletter, said the
support of certain developers is to be expected.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the simplest way out in lot of cases," he said. "The
emerging solution in the last couple of years is to buy your way out
of [the] problem. The question is where the money comes from. ... You
don't have to be a genius to figure this out."</TE>
<TE>   Repeated Challenges</TE>
<TE>   He cited the Bolsa Chica example. Developers originally proposed a
marina, hotel and as many as 5,700 homes in the late 1970s. That plan
and several others have been approved by county and state agencies,
only to be scaled back after repeated environmental legal challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the struggle is over the remaining 230-acre mesa
overlooking the wetlands. The company's latest proposal to build as
many as 1,235 homes is tied up--both in a court fight and before the
Coastal Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The mesa is the sole parcel Proposition 50 mentions by name as a
priority for acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're Bolsa Chica, you've got to be tired of [fighting],"
Fulton said. "No matter how much rhetoric they give about wanting to
build, most landowners just want their money. That's why they're
willing to give."</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, California voters have passed three
environmental bond measures totaling $6.7 billion. A June poll by the
nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California indicates that
Proposition 50 is headed for approval in November, with 59% of
registered voters favoring it and 29% opposed. The remaining 12% are
undecided.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers' groups question the wisdom of creating additional debt
when the state has a nearly $24-billion budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "While the goal may sound worthwhile, the [bond] ends up
benefiting certain special interests disproportionately," said Kris
Vosburgh, executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.
"Follow the money."</TE>
<TE>   That's also a concern of some in the environmental community.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course they all see it as a payday for them for their
speculative developments," said Marcia Hanscom, executive director of
the Wetlands Action Network, which has yet to take a position on the
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Some local activists endorse the measure, developer financing and
all. Paul Arms, a board member with the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, said
he was thrilled that the owner of the mesa is backing a measure to
help the public buy and preserve the land.</TE>
<TE>   "Their help is very much appreciated," Arms said. "I look forward
to popping a bottle of champagne with them once it gets purchased."</TE>

<HD>Online Master's Degree Clicking With Students</HD>
<DH>Education: Cal State Fullerton expects 20 to begin its
first graduate program on the Internet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cal State Fullerton officials expect at least 20 students to register
for the university's first master's degree program to be offered
almost entirely online.</LD>
<LD>   The online master of science program in instructional design and
technology will be launched this fall.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the wave of the future," coordinator JoAnn Carter-Wells
said. "It's a program for working professionals that will allow them
to work at their own pace and in their own time."</LD>
<TE>   The program was created in response to a growing demand from
military personnel, industry professionals and teachers for advanced
education in instructional design, she said. The 20-month program
will train students to, among other things, create complex multimedia
presentations for educational purposes.</TE>
<TE>   "People are being asked more and more to design programs that can
be delivered in a multimedia fashion, and most of them don't have the
background," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, she said, the program will prepare graduates for
careers as software consultants, instructional technology trainers
and instructional designers.</TE>
<TE>   "It will have a heavy application component," Carter-Wells said,
"so that people in a work setting can develop something they can
utilize."</TE>
<TE>   Though students will be required to attend a two-day campus
orientation and return midway through the program for a 1 1/2-day
symposium, most work will be done over the Internet. Students will be
expected to spend six to 10 hours a week working on each course, 10
of which are required for graduation, Carter-Wells said.</TE>
<TE>   Two other California State University campuses--Hayward and
Sacramento--have similar programs, Carter-Wells said, but Fullerton's
will be the first offered to professionals other than teachers.</TE>

<HD>Could It Be They're Taking the Farm Out of Knott's?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I don't usually cover the news from the petting zoo at Knott's Berry
Farm, but we're short-staffed these days, so I pitched in last week.</LD>
<LD>   Can you believe it? First day on the beat, and a story dropped in
my lap.</LD>
<LD>   After 20 years of delighting kiddies and adults alike at Camp
Snoopy, the petting zoo may be closing. Knott's wouldn't confirm it,
but when I gave them a chance to deny it, they wouldn't do that,
either. That caused me to stroke my chin and murmur, "Hmmm."</LD>
<TE>   Our source is none other than the "Bird Lady of Orange," otherwise
known as Susan Doggett. A licensed wildlife rehabilitator, Doggett
has a long-running relationship with Knott's because each year it
sends her dozens of birds that are injured on its grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Accordingly, Doggett got a call one day last week about an injured
bird. When she reached her usual contact at Knott's, however, she
thought he sounded upset. He proceeded to tell her that the petting
zoo was shutting as of Nov. 1. Doggett says another Knott's employee
verified his account of what Knott's officials told them.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no iffiness about it," Doggett says. "I've known him
long enough and trust him to know he's not making it up."</TE>
<TE>   Knowing I was on to potentially the biggest Berry Farm story of
the week, I phoned Susan Tierney, the park's chief spokeswoman. She
was cordial but noncommittal. Next year marks the 20th anniversary of
six-acre Camp Snoopy, she said, and the park plans some capital
improvements. Those plans are still in the works, she said, and
what's talked about one day "can be changed the next."</TE>
<TE>   That tells me that if anyone wants to get a petition drive going
to save the petting zoo, now would be a good time to start one.</TE>
<TE>   Does anyone care?</TE>
<TE>   In a world where youngsters understand megabytes but not where
milk comes from, does anyone still care if children can't pet a goat
or feed oats to a horse?</TE>
<TE>   Heck, yes, says Doggett, who has a book about the park's founder,
the late Walter Knott. "My grandfather was a friend of Walter
Knott's," she says. "If Walter Knott had any idea this was going to
happen, he'd be rolling over."</TE>
<TE>   Removing the zoo, Doggett says, would strip it of its "family"
feel and make it more like any other amusement park dominated by
thrill rides. "This is a nostalgic place, it's all old-time themed,
and they're getting away from what Knott wanted," Doggett says.</TE>
<TE>   Well, we can't run that by Mr. Knott, but it's true that society
doesn't place the same importance on hanging around a barnyard or a
corral that it once did.</TE>
<TE>   A pity, Doggett says. In her view, contact with animals educates
children and gives them a more balanced view of life on the planet.
"These are animals that city kids, especially, don't see," she says.
"They don't have an opportunity to come face-to-face with these
things anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The sad truth is, it's not Knott's responsibility to ensure that
children maintain contact with farm animals. They run a business out
there, and if they think horses and goats don't pull a crowd like
they once did, well ...</TE>
<TE>   Now, if the public were to rise up and demand that the park keep
its chickens and pigs, that might get the businessmen's attention.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be crass about it, but I doubt Knott's will be moved by
laments of lost yesteryears. They may pay attention, however, to what
a parkgoer said last week when told about the rumor of the zoo's
demise.</TE>
<TE>   "You're kidding," the 40-year-old mother of four told a Times
reporter. "They can't do that. Kids love it here. This place started
out as a farm. It's the last of the farm that's left."</TE>
<TE>   She then added jokingly: "Let's picket."</TE>
<TE>   Picket. Now there's a word that could make the Knotts folks fall
in love all over again with barnyard creatures.</TE>

Project</HD>
<DH>Redevelopment: Town officials envision a model Latino
community. The Library Plaza was a first step.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rolling along the streets of San Fernando in an electric car that
resembled a high-tech golf cart, Mayor Cindy Montanez pointed out
abandoned buildings and vacant lots that she sees as valuable symbols
of the city's history.</LD>
<LD>   With some money, a developer with an eye for historic architecture
and lots of hard work, she said, those overgrown plots and run-down
structures could also be the city's future.</LD>
<LD>   Montanez and other San Fernando officials are in the process of
giving the city a makeover that they hope will change its image from
a gritty, northeast San Fernando Valley 'hood into a model Latino
community.</LD>
<TE>   They started by opening the popular Library Plaza last year. In
addition to the local library, the plaza on the city's main downtown
thoroughfare of Maclay Avenue features a coffee shop, yoga studio,
Mexican restaurant and barbershop. They hope to continue their effort
with other cultural and redevelopment projects along main streets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be the art, history and culture of this community
that's going to allow businesses to come in and create a high quality
of life in the city, in a community that has historically been
underserved," Montanez said.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes according to plan, the city could get a satellite of
the Latino Museum of History, Art and Culture, a Cesar Chavez
Memorial and a downtown "streetscape" featuring new lampposts, bus
shelters and greenery.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, ideas emanate from the city of San Fernando" that
would also be good strategies for the surrounding areas, said Los
Angeles City Council President Alex Padilla, who represents the
communities surrounding San Fernando in the northeast Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said Pacoima also is working on improving its main street,
Van Nuys Boulevard. Mission Hills is beginning to study the
possibility of a cultural history center, and a children's museum is
planned for the Hansen Dam Recreation Area in Lake View Terrace.</TE>
<TE>   San Fernando officials are negotiating to lease an old firehouse
for the new Latino Museum branch, said Dan LaBrado, director of the
city's Department of Recreation and Community Services. The firehouse
is located among the professional offices and well-kept homes on
Brand Boulevard, near the city's southwest entrance from Mission
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to do outreach in areas where there was maybe a need to
have more of a presence of art," said Stan Sosa, vice president of
the museum's board of trustees. Sosa said the museum, which has a new
downtown Los Angeles location, would also like to open branches in
East and South-Central Los Angeles, in addition to the northeast
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   LaBrado said he expects the lease to be signed and the facility to
open this month.</TE>
<TE>   Within a year, the city says the Cesar Chavez Memorial Transit
Plaza should be completed. The $240,000 project, funded by the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority and private donors, will
include a rest area for Metrolink and bus riders, a bikeway and a
memorial to the farm-worker hero, said Ron Ruiz, the city grant
administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz said many in San Fernando "have a sense of history with
[Chavez], worked with him in the past and really identify with what
he stood for."</TE>
<TE>   The memorial site is 23,000 square feet of land at Truman and
Wolfskill streets near the southeast entrance to the city from
Pacoima. It will include a 6-foot-tall bronze statue of Chavez
holding a dove, 10 metal sculptures of farm workers turned
protesters, a 50-foot mural depicting Chavez's life, and an
eagle-shaped fountain.</TE>
<TE>   The plaza also will have more trees, safety signs around the
railroad tracks and wheelchair ramps, according to the city's plans.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Richard Ramos is excited about the Chavez memorial, but
he said city officials are sometimes too quick to back development
plans without considering all the options. While Ramos supports the
idea of showcasing local and Latino art, he said he voted against the
Latino Museum project.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't feel we had enough information to make an informed
decision," he said. "I've never got a report on it."</TE>
<TE>   The reports are in for the downtown street improvement plan, which
stretches from 1st to 8th streets on Maclay Avenue. The MTA awarded
the city $1.5 million for the project, which is aimed at attracting
more pedestrian traffic and dollars and is expected to take two
years.</TE>
<TE>   The avenue will get 9-foot-wide tree and shrub planters bearing
the city's name and motto for key intersections, 9-foot long
evergreen tree planters along curbs, and more trees and shrubs along
sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   The city also wants the streetlights to have a historic look.
Black or bronze scrolled lamp braces and bell-shaped lamp covers will
replace the existing "cobra-head" streetlights. There will be new bus
shelters with red Mission-style clay tile roofs, and black steel bus
benches and trash cans.</TE>
<TE>   On Maclay Avenue, San Fernando-based developer Pueblo Contracting
Services Inc. wants to rebuild the old Spanish-style Rey Hotel, which
was destroyed in a fire caused by the 1971 earthquake--although it
wouldn't be used as a hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a gorgeous building, one that we probably could not
have come up with on our own," said Severyn Aszkenazy, vice president
of Pueblo Contracting, which also built Library Plaza. "It's
interesting to bring some historical architecture back."</TE>
<TE>   The building, which has not yet been approved, would be two
stories tall. Aszkenazy said he is negotiating to put a Quizno's
sandwich shop, a retail store and an AOL Time Warner customer service
center on the ground floor, and a satellite campus of Mission College
on the top floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Architecturally, this would be very much in line with the
revitalizing new developments that the city is counting on for North
Maclay," said Paul Deibel, the city's community development director.</TE>
<TE>   Aszkenazy also hopes to build a patio with tables and chairs in an
existing alleyway that connects the now-vacant hotel building, which
in its latest incarnation was a Social Security Administration
building, to the back of City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to present his plan to the city's Planning
Commission on Tuesday. If it's approved, Aszkenazy would present the
plan to the Redevelopment Agency on Aug. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Deibel says more mixed-use developments should be the next step
for San Fernando. "One of the main objectives is to improve and add
to the livability of the area for residents of San Fernando," he
said. "And have new developments be positive additions to the
community as a place to live as well as to shop."</TE>

<HD>Long Pushes for Map Showing Sex Offenders</HD>
<DH>Safety: Because of recent child abductions, the Ventura
County supervisor proposes indicating the general location of felons
on the government's Web site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a few clicks on their home computers, Ventura County residents
may soon be able to view an online map showing the vicinity where
convicted sex offenders live.</LD>
<LD>   County Supervisor Kathy Long, who is proposing the map, said a
recent series of high-profile child kidnappings convinced her that
parents need a convenient way to get information about sex offenders
in their neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   She will ask the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to support the
idea and direct staff to begin working out the details.</LD>
<TE>   Long said it is "scary and ugly" to know that Ventura County is
home to eight offenders who have been classified as high risk and 883
who are considered a serious risk for sexual offenses.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that combats fear is information and access to it,"
Long said. "You can work with your children and make sure you are
doing everything you can to protect them."</TE>
<TE>   Information is available at a law enforcement kiosk in Ventura and
two in Thousand Oaks. The proposed map would be posted on the
county's Web site and show the general location of sex offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Offenders convicted of repeated violent sexual assaults would be
marked as high risk. The locations of parks, libraries and schools
would also be indicated.</TE>
<TE>   States have adopted different definitions of who is included in
their public registry of sex offenders and how the information is
made public.</TE>
<TE>   In 20 states, names of offenders are routinely posted on the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   California law prohibits placing the names and addresses of sex
offenders on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   But the public can get their names and descriptions by visiting
one of the police kiosks. Rap sheets and photographs are also
available there.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers must sign a statement that they will not use the
information to harass or commit a crime against a registrant.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Sheriff Bob Brooks said his department supports the
idea as long as the logistics can be worked out and the project
funded.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County, which voted last week to place similar
information on its Web site, estimated the cost at $48,000.</TE>
<TE>   One problem is keeping the listing current. About 20% of the
registry is inaccurate at any given time, Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some are dead, some are in prison and some have moved," Brooks
said. "The only way to find out is to individually check locations,
which our investigators do periodically."</TE>
<TE>   Megan's Law, enacted in 1996, provides for public access to
information about child molesters and other sexual offenders.</TE>
<TE>   It is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old New Jersey girl who was
raped and killed by a paroled child molester who, unbeknownst to her
parents, had moved to a home across the street from their own.</TE>
<TE>   Sex offenders are required to register with local law enforcement
agencies after their release from jail or prison.</TE>
<TE>   With few exceptions, they must update this information once a year
for the rest of their life.</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights groups have argued that this is unfair to offenders
who are no longer considered dangerous to the community. The U.S.
Supreme Court is expected to rule this fall on whether states can
post offenders' names on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   It's a dilemma facing all governments right now, with the public
clamoring to isolate and punish child molesters, Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a balancing act of the community's right to know versus the
right of someone who has served their time to live a life without
harassment or vigilante justice," he said.</TE>

<LD>While thousands of people marveled at the professional surfers
gliding over Huntington Beach's waves and others cheered at the
extreme bikers and skaters performing aerial tricks on specially
built ramps, Brandon Lawson was feeling like a surfer without getting
his feet wet.</LD>
<LD>   Lawson, 24, clutched a joystick and stared at a digital screen
where he simulated the art of surfing, immersed in a virtual-reality
video game. His purple Michael Jordan basketball jersey stood out in
Philips' Digital Beach, a trench of high technology that is a feature
of this year's Philip's U.S. Open of surfing.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt like I was really surfing," Lawson said soon after he was
wiped out by a virtual wave.</LD>
<TE>   Outside, on the real beach, the ambience was even more surreal.
Surfing's top competitors walked Huntington Beach's coastal streets
with their hair still wet, toting boards in each hand. Scantily clad
extreme-sports fans showed off a collage of tattoos and body
piercings.</TE>
<TE>   Folk singers, accompanied by guitars, competed with strident punk
music on loudspeakers. And masses huddled around the sponsors'
booths, scuffling over free sunglasses and skateboards. More than
20,000 people visited the open Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The organizers of the annual surfing event strove to be different.
This year's motto: "When action sports, music and technology
collide," said Mike Kingsbury, public relations director for Philips
Fusion.</TE>
<TE>   "We combined the history and tradition of surfing with the
popularity of extreme sports," said James Leitz, vice president of
IMG X Sports.</TE>
<TE>   Collisions during the event were more than symbolic. About 11:30
a.m., a woman lost control of her car and knocked over a concrete
post meant to keep vehicles away from the pier's pedestrian entrance.
No one was hurt. A collision in the skating bowl during the Best
Trick competition took 36-year-old skating star Mike Smith out of the
contest with a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   The skating event featured riders in various categories and
ranging in age from 24 to 45. It included skaters from countries such
as Cuba and Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to honor the guys from all ages who have been skating for
a long time," said Don Bostick, president of World Cup Skating, which
organized the skating event.</TE>
<TE>   While the skaters tried to match each other's tricks, extreme BMX
cyclists sprang from ramps behind the skating competition. The air
became part of the stage and the surfing moves were emulated on
wheels.</TE>
<TE>   "Surfing is the grandfather of many of the extreme sports," Leitz
said about the similarities in the various open-air events.</TE>
<TE>   Leitz said the organization of this year's event was more
demanding than in years past. The number of sponsors has grown, as
have the expectations of the people who swarm to Huntington Beach to
view surfing's premier contest each year.</TE>
<TE>   As the surfing competition concludes today, finesse and experience
become more important for the competitors, many of whom view the open
as a contest for prestige.</TE>
<TE>   For surfing fan Wes Williams, 19, the greatest expectation was
that the event would be "fun."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Open defending champion Rob Machado had a message for the
crowd: "Thanks for loving the sport and being a part of the surfing
world."</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is turning to an
old-fashioned way of helping residents cool their homes: tree power.</LD>
<LD>   The utility has launched a program to give away 100,000 shade
trees to its customers in the coming year. The aim is to create
natural cooling and reduce electricity needed to run air
conditioners.</LD>
<LD>   Officials say the program will also help beautify the city and cut
smog. The new trees will remove thousands of tons of air pollutants
annually, according to the DWP.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, at Shadow Ranch Park in West Hills, the first of five
August workshops for San Fernando Valley residents interested in the
Trees for a Green L.A. program drew a small but enthusiastic audience
of seven people.</TE>
<TE>   Still, workshop instructor Brian Miller pressed on, giving
residents pointers on staking young trees and choosing the best
species for particular locations.</TE>
<TE>   Each tree planted will save about 81 kilowatt-hours of electricity
annually, enough to run a television set six hours a day for about 67
days, the DWP says.</TE>
<TE>   While the natural cooling method is low-tech, it isn't as simple
as digging a hole and sticking in a sapling.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'How difficult can it be to plant a tree?' " said
Harriet Perry, who requested two trees for her North Hills property.
"But if you want it to grow, you have to do it right."</TE>
<TE>   Workshop attendance is required for DWP customers to receive up to
seven free trees. The 6-foot trees will be delivered within two
weeks, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP is offering about 40 types of trees that would retail from
about $20 to $55.</TE>

<HD>Man With Gun Shot by Police in Oxnard</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 29-year-old Oxnard man, apparently distraught over a relationship,
was shot in the shoulder by police late Friday after he allegedly
came toward officers with a loaded gun.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Baker was in stable condition Saturday at St. John's
Regional Medical Center in Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   When he recovers, Baker will be jailed on suspicion of several
felonies, including evading police and resisting arrest, police said.</LD>
<TE>   "He apparently told his mom he was going to have police kill him
or he was going to kill himself," Police Sgt. Jim Seitz said
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 p.m. Friday, Baker's ex-girlfriend called authorities to
report that Baker had been harassing her repeatedly since she ended
their relationship several months ago, Seitz said.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, whom police did not identify, said Baker had driven by
her apartment in the 700 block of Ivywood Drive in Oxnard several
days ago and fired a bullet into her front door while she was home.</TE>
<TE>   When officers arrived, they found evidence of the gunshot and
immediately issued the woman a restraining order against Baker, Seitz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Patrol officers citywide were alerted to the make and model of
Baker's car, a Mercury Sable, and his physical description. He was
spotted minutes later, driving in the 900 block of South Ventura
Road, Seitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers tried to pull Baker over but he sped away, leading them
on a short chase that ended in front of his ex-girlfriend's home,
Seitz said.</TE>
<TE>   "During the pursuit, he was on a cell phone with his mom and told
her how he felt," Seitz said. "She was apparently able to hear all
the sirens in the background."</TE>
<TE>   After the chase, Baker allegedly ignored police commands to
surrender and walked toward the ex-girlfriend's apartment, Seitz
said. A police dog was dispatched and bit Baker on the arm, at which
time he turned and allegedly pointed his gun at officers.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Baker dropped his gun after an officer, who was
not identified, fired two rounds, one of which struck him in the
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   The officer was placed on paid administrative leave while the
shooting is under review, which is standard department policy. Police
officials and the district attorney will investigate the shooting to
determine if it was justified.</TE>
<TE>   Baker was convicted in 1999 of possession of a controlled
substance and sentenced to 120 days in jail, court records indicate.
Last year, he pleaded guilty to possessing drug paraphernalia and
driving under the influence.</TE>

<HD>UCI Sends a Clear Message</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one in the county would disagree with UCI Medical Center's
years-long complaint: It has been saddled with trying to heal too
many of the county's poor people. Others have to help more. This
situation will have to end at some point.</LD>
<LD>   But Orange County and the medical community never stepped forward
to help. So the situation is ending at this point, with the medical
center refusing to treat new uninsured patients unless they're
emergency cases or live within a few miles of the hospital or its
clinics.</LD>
<LD>   The victims are the working people who fall ill. They will be
turned away from one more place and forced to search for treatment
that should be readily available.</LD>
<TE>   UCI's message is clear and fair: It no longer will shoulder a
disproportionately huge caseload among Orange County's 20,000
medically indigent residents. A better-managed system is needed. With
health costs rising for everyone, government at all levels must put
more money toward medical care for these people. Their care is both a
moral and legal obligation.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, UCI also is sending other messages. Chief Executive Ralph
Cygan would like to fashion his medical center into the premier range
of such teaching and research hospitals as UCSF and Stanford
University. And, with occupancy rates rising, the hospital can
improve its bottom line by filling beds with insured patients.</TE>
<TE>   UCI bought the hospital in Orange from the county 25 years ago,
but it has never thrown off the image of a public hospital. Poor
people have continued to flock to its doors and, for the most part,
found treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Problem solved, the rest of the county thought. Doctors regularly
refer the working poor to UCI Medical Center even when the patients
live much closer to other hospitals. The medical center in one recent
year provided 29% of inpatient services for these patients, even
though 24 other hospitals are supposed to be providing care.</TE>
<TE>   UCI's not-gonna-take-it-anymore stance should finally galvanize
bureaucrats and politicians, who have known that UCI would take this
action but have been molasses-slow to cure their own program for the
medically indigent. One important move forward: County administrators
will pre-approve treatment so all healers know what costs will be
reimbursed.</TE>
<TE>   But the county still runs an underfunded and inefficient system
that emphasizes care for only the most urgently ill. The county's
contracts with hospitals don't extend to primary-care physicians. The
county needs to nail those down quickly, actively recruit more
doctors and streamline reimbursement and manage care so the system
intervenes before treatment grows more serious and more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, what will happen to people toiling for low pay at jobs
with no benefits when they get sick? If they're from the wrong ZIP
Code, UCI will direct them to the county. An overwhelmed civil
servant will try to track down a willing doctor. More often, the
patients will line up at the county's already burdened community
clinics--or delay care until their condition becomes
life-threatening. At that point, hospitals will have to treat them.</TE>

<HD>Great Park a Question Mark</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine's political leaders are acknowledging what many Orange County
residents already suspected: It will take a huge pile of money to
build a really Great Park at the former El Toro Marine base, and
another mountain of green to maintain it. And it's clear that city
officials don't know where all of the money will come from.</LD>
<LD>   Critics fume that the funding gap is further proof that the Great
Park was never more than a ploy to bury plans for a commercial
airport at El Toro. And, because nothing about El Toro is ever
simple, two county supervisors are demanding that the park plan go on
the countywide ballot in November--potentially the fifth such vote on
what to do with the closed base.</LD>
<LD>   The Navy's decision to sell 3,763 acres of the former base to
developers clearly wasn't what Irvine expected. The city thought it
would get the land free; the Navy instead opted for an auction.
Bidders must agree to deed 84% of the land to the public and
contribute to a park construction and maintenance trust fund.</LD>
<TE>   As we said in July, the agreement marked a bold but
question-provoking start. The list of questions began to mushroom
days after the park proposal was unveiled, when Irvine acknowledged
that some elements of the Great Park will heavily depend upon
donations. Irvine's city manager described gardens, ponds and stone
walkways as "jewelry" that will be paid for by donors. That
description won't sit well with county residents who view such
elements as ingredients in a true Great Park recipe.</TE>
<TE>   A key question is how much risk developers will be willing to
shoulder. That answer won't surface until bid packages are released.
Risk is inherent in development, but developers' bids will fall short
of Irvine's mark if now-cloudy issues aren't clarified.</TE>
<TE>   Real or feared environmental clean-up costs could derail the
bidding process. Irvine maintains that the land is clean, but the
Navy's environmental impact report assumed that fighter jets would
give way to passenger airplanes, not picnickers.</TE>
<TE>   Developers also need to know whether sewage lines, roads and other
essentials must be repaired or replaced. They need more details on
the long-term financial commitment Irvine will demand to fill the
proposed trust fund.</TE>
<TE>   In an odd twist, a city known for master planning is moving
forward without a master developer along the lines of The Irvine Co.
The city's major developer has said it won't bid on the base land or
play a role in its development. The auction is intended to generate
quick revenue for the Navy, but a piecemeal sale won't ensure that
the various Great Park components move forward in harmony.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in a free-market economy, key elements of the plan will
depend upon the economy cooperating. The county's perpetual housing
shortage means that the 3,400 proposed homes will easily be absorbed.
But the proposed 2.9 million square feet of retail space might not
immediately succeed in a county saturated with retail centers. The
Irvine Co. also has approvals to add 17 million square feet of office
space nearby.</TE>
<TE>   It's early in the Great Park process. But Irvine can smooth the
road by quickly answering the growing list of questions.</TE>

<LD>You'd think that Newport Beach would know that rich people are
whizzes at making money.</LD>
<LD>   Not necessarily so. City officials appear stunned to learn that
residents along Newport Bay are making good sums, some $1,000 a month
or more, by renting out their boat slips to yacht owners. This
irritates officials because the city leases slip spaces to homeowners
for chump change--$80 a year. The privately built and owned docks
rest on state "land," but the city collects rent because it's the
trustee of the property.</LD>
<LD>   The city's Harbor Commission is studying this issue of making a
private profit off public lands with an eye toward imposing
additional fees on residents who sublet dock space.</LD>
<TE>   Ignored in all this is the question of why the city--and by
extension the state--are cutting millionaires an incredible break on
parking spaces for their yachts.</TE>
<TE>   Government is missing the boat. It has no business virtually
giving away the public's land to people who can afford to pay for it.
And these landowners are profiting because a dock raises the value of
a house at least $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   But why should the city care whether wealthy homeowners dock their
own yacht or one belonging to another wealthy person? Newport Beach
should charge an equitable price; once people have paid, it should be
up to them whether they rent it out or use the dock as a floating
exercise mat.</TE>
<TE>   Making a profit off public lands has a long history in this
country. Consider the timber and grazing rights on federal land. And
for decades, the state has rented out mobile home spaces at El Morro
Village near Laguna Beach for about half the market price. Those
homes, with their to-drool-over ocean views, frequently are rented to
third parties. Only now, when the state wants that land back for
public use, has anyone suggested that mobile-home owners should pay
the going rate.</TE>
<TE>   This is the same state whose budget--once it gets around to
passing a budget--is expected to force deep cuts in job training and
day care for poor Orange County residents.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach will need to pay the substantial costs of stemming
urban runoff responsible for much of the pollution in Newport
Bay--where these boats are docked.</TE>
<TE>   Public officials have valuable revenue resources at their command
that could be used to help clean up the environment and help
down-and-out people get a leg up in the work world. The waterside
homeowners are smart enough to charge market rates for their slips.
City and state officials should learn from their example.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Get Me to the Gate on Time," July 28:</LD>
<LD>   I see John Wayne Airport is a top pick if you want to get to your
gate in a hurry. No surprise here. My husband has flown out of John
Wayne twice since Sept. 11. Even though he has knee and hip
replacements made with titanium, he breezed through the metal
detector with nary a peep. Not so at other airports, where his metal
body parts have never failed to set off bells and whistles. Is it
possible that John Wayne Airport's crack security system is a factor
in the short waiting time?</LD>
<LD>   Jeannie Woods</LD>
<TE>   Laguna Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I fly fairly often, and I appreciate the increased security at our
nation's airports. I would like to know why when I went through
security at John Wayne Airport on June 24 we were told there was no
need to show photo identification. I also learned from a United
Airlines employee that there was no one checking ID cards at the
employee parking lot, a procedure that supposedly has been in place
for some time.</TE>
<TE>   Why are we even going through the long lines and extra steps of
having a security person checking if a person wishing to enter the
gate area does not need to prove who he or she is?</TE>
<TE>   Has the FAA quietly changed its procedures, or is this just
isolated to John Wayne? I would also like to know why these security
procedures have changed and when the changes were instituted.</TE>

<HD>Carona Gets Mixed Reviews in Runnion Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Carona Formed a Posse With a Plea," July 26:</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the efforts of the investigators of the Orange County
Sheriff's Department and our news media, a suspect is in custody in
the death of Samantha Runnion. This is how it is supposed to work: A
child is reported missing, a diligent investigation by local law
enforcement follows, and the media urgently disseminate information
to the public that will help locate the child. This case had a
terribly tragic outcome but our community should applaud the efforts
of all who assisted, especially Sheriff Mike Carona, who spent many
hours coordinating with law enforcement and the media. I am proud
that Carona is our sheriff and offer my heartfelt thanks to the
reporters who carried this story in the various media.</LD>
<LD>   John Williams</LD>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am rather shocked that Sheriff Carona completely skips over the
fact that his "collar" was accused and acquitted two years ago. When
little Samantha's friend gave that chilling composite and car
description it should have been shown around the complex. How many
adults would have immediately recognized the perpetrator from before
and sent the sheriff's office directly to him? They would have been
on to him within hours.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Cleveland</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Carona's extraordinary leadership in the Samantha Runnion
case deserves public commendation. Not only did he inspire
unprecedented interagency cooperation, he drew in the public to
provide thousands of tips and included the media in a most respectful
way. His riveting news conferences were heartfelt and illustrated how
tirelessly all in law enforcement were working.</TE>
<TE>   Further reinforcing the bond among those involved, he declared
that "Samantha had become our little girl." He used his final press
briefing not to detail all the evidence against the suspect, but to
express his openly emotional appreciation to the FBI, Riverside
County sheriff, his own department, the media and especially the
public, without whose involvement the accused man, Alejandro Avila,
would not so quickly have been apprehended.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Rocamora</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Apparently The Times has lost its guts, at least in the opinion
department. Absolutely no adverse letters to Sheriff Carona's
swaggering, self-congratulatory proclamation of "100%" certainty of
guilt of suspect Avila were published. So we don't need courts,
juries or judges any longer. Nor do we need a district attorney or
defense counsels. All we need is the sheriff taking on all of the
above himself. Whatever happened to "due process"?</TE>
<TE>   R. Edmondson</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is really unfortunate that prosecution of the miserable,
depraved creature who kidnapped, sexually molested and murdered
5-year-old Samantha Runnion is going to be under the jurisdiction of
Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   This is the same man who in his televised news conference declared
that he would decide in two weeks whether to ask for the death
penalty for the perpetrator of this horrendous crime against a child,
where the evidence against the suspect is solid and irrefutable.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, I would like to see the person responsible for Samantha's
death tried in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia or North Korea, where the
trial would last about two or three days and the convicted killer
would be executed immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Peter J. Moore</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the Samantha Runnion case, Rackauckas said anyone who
commits such an act should "either die in prison of natural causes or
be executed."</TE>
<TE>   As heinous as this crime is, bear in mind that because of our
mushy liberal court of appeals and defense lawyers getting rich
filing appeals, there are more than 600 inmates on death row. They
have committed crimes just as atrocious, and it is obvious that they
are going to die a natural death.</TE>
<TE>   Basically, we the public have lost control of our laws concerning
illegal immigration, drugs, and of course, capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the latter and proving my point, can anybody tell me
when the next execution is scheduled?</TE>
<TE>   Don Williams</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I had the privilege of serving on a jury in an assault/threat case
recently in Orange County. The wrangling by the lawyers to get a jury
favorable to their point of view was intense, taking half as long as
the trial itself.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, the prosecution had an ongoing testy dialogue
with the judge over evidence, procedure and rules, much to the
delight of the defense attorney. The defense attorney was
better-prepared, no question about it. There wasn't a great deal of
hard evidence, mostly the testimony of a blue-collar immigrant
husband and wife, spoken in broken English, assisted by an
interpreter. Their testimony was attacked repeatedly as unreliable.
The judge, over and over again, ruled in favor of the defense.</TE>
<TE>   There was quite a bit of circumstantial evidence, but mostly it
came down to whether one believed the accusations of the couple, who
had absolutely no reason whatsoever to make any of this up.</TE>
<TE>   Cut to the jury room: I've never in my life sat with so many
adults that couldn't add two plus two to get four. Modern Americans
have lost the ability to reason. Fortunately, reason prevailed and we
returned a guilty verdict. I truly wonder what those jurors think now
about the case we decided, in light of what happened to poor Samantha
Runnion. Did we save a life? Who knows. All we did was think (and
argue) it through.</TE>
<TE>   Avila's jurors on the original child-molestation trial were "just
following instructions" about "reasonable doubt" and now a little
girl is dead. Prospective jurors: Do the math and listen to your gut
instincts. Defense attorneys and judges don't seem to be long on
common sense these days.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Cervellone</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though I sympathize with Erin Runnion, who recently lost her
5-year-old daughter, Samantha, to a tragic murder, and I can
understand her anger and feel her unbearable pain, I think she is out
of line for chastising the jurors who acquitted Alejandro Avila on an
earlier unrelated child molestation case, saying that they are
responsible for her daughter's death.</TE>
<TE>   It is highly unfair to place the blame on them. We don't live in
the times of the futuristic "Minority Report," where crimes can be
predicted with certainty before they happen, and perpetrators
apprehended and sentenced. Jurors can only be expected to try to make
rational, fair and just decisions, and not be psychics delving into
the future to see the consequences of their actions.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Avila had been convicted on that previous child
molestation case, there is no guarantee that after release he would
not commit acts of child molestation again. And because most child
molesters are not murderers, there would be no way to predict that
Avila would have ever murdered a child. Blaming others, particularly
unjustly, does nothing to prevent future acts of child molestation
and murder. Once such cases have reached the trial stage it is
already too late.</TE>

<HD>Killers of Opossums Should Be Punished</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Opossum Killings Test Limits of Cruelty Cases," July 29:</LD>
<LD>   As a high school English teacher, I never pass up the opportunity
to teach my students the importance of respecting all living
creatures. As a devoted animal lover, I was appalled and sickened by
the heartbreaking photo accompanying the disturbing story on opossum
killings.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone who has ever observed opossums knows that they are
harmless, timid creatures.</LD>
<TE>   It is disappointing that Kirk Broomall was acquitted in an animal
cruelty trial when it is obvious that the man gets enjoyment by
seeing an innocent animal suffer a long, slow and painful death.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-cruelty laws need to continue to be strengthened. The next
time Broomall sees an opossum in his yard, he should remember the
classic Beatles song and just "Let It Be."</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne E. Feighery</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The article quotes Aaron Reyes of the animal control authority as
saying that had Broomall called authorities, "We would have
responded, picked it up and educated him."</TE>
<TE>   Reyes is the one who needs to be educated. I recently trapped a
female opossum and her four babies, and I mistakenly thought that all
I had to do was contact animal control. They advised me to contact
the Opossum Assn. of Irvine and provided me a telephone number that
no one answered.</TE>
<TE>   After spending the greater part of the day struggling with what to
do with the animals, I eventually set them free in one of the larger
parks in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Perry</TE>
<TE>   Cypress</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What shocked me more than the picture of the (still) living
opossum riddled with arrows was the story that went with it. The
security guard and Kirk Broomall both went after those small animals
in outrageous ways. Both should suffer consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Broomall's actions, however, are especially troubling. That is
three small animals he has either burned alive or shot with arrows
and then finished off with a shovel and a pipe. If he isn't under
psychiatric care or police watch for his repeated willingness to burn
or batter something small to death, he should be.</TE>
<TE>   He probably doesn't realize it but his family and neighbors have
more to worry about from him than any opossum in the backyard.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, opossums don't like water. You can herd them out of
your yard with a hose.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Greer</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times' photo this morning of the opossum with three crossbow
bolts through its body makes me want to do the same to its shooter.
And for all you potential bow "hunters" out there, this photo is the
real truth: Arrows rarely kill an animal quickly or painlessly.</TE>
<TE>   And the truth about opossums: There isn't a more timid wild
animal. Their perceived ferocity is all bluff.</TE>
<TE>   Your article should serve to educate a few of the truly clueless
imbeciles among us, providing these miscreants can read and have read
this article. Thank you.</TE>

<LD>Re "Orange County's 'Great Park' Comes With a Great Price Tag," July
29:</LD>
<LD>   The "Great Park" story leaves the reader with conflicting
opinions. Pro-airport activists claim the park will be short of money
and will be a massive development project. Urban park experts say the
Irvine-Navy endowment agreement for El Toro is sound, and is being
used successfully in Atlanta, Denver and New York.</LD>
<LD>   Gee, whom does one believe?</LD>
<TE>   These same Newport Beach activists have proposed a similar park at
El Toro, wrapped around a huge unneeded "LAX-south" airport that they
falsely said would reduce our county noise levels, traffic and air
pollution. Their agenda is simple: They want to triple Orange County
air travel and move it all from Newport to El Toro at any cost.</TE>
<TE>   In the next two months, Irvine will complete plans for the Great
Park. Issues like pollution (which the Navy already has an agreement
with the EPA to mitigate), demolition of runways and projected park
development costs will be defined, and the public will then be able
to better judge the realism of the Irvine-Navy plan.</TE>
<TE>   After eight years and $50 million, pro-airport activists have
managed only to convince county voters they weren't telling us the
truth. I'm betting that with a fraction of that level of effort,
Irvine will prove the "sour grapes" critics dead wrong (again).</TE>

<TE>   After reading this article by Evan Halper, one is left to ponder
from where the headline and all the "critics" of the Great Park
emanated. The article I read quoted positive and insightful
observations by Dan Biederman, Steve Weston and Ken Ryan, none of
whom are on the payroll of the city of Irvine. The only "critic" was
one sentence from the never-ending sore-loser whiners from the
Airport Working Group. The "critical" quote, however, had no author.
Have things gotten so bad for them that they won't even supply a
source for their quotes? Or is it that the L.A. Times editorial board
[is] just a bit upset that it couldn't influence the Orange County
voter? Maybe you should just go back to supporting water theft from
the Owens Valley.</TE>

<TE>   While I'm glad the city of Irvine's current plans for [the former]
El Toro Marine base provide for substantial open space, I'm extremely
disappointed with the proposed mix of uses in development areas of
the base. Though several thousand housing units are proposed, that's
thousands less than the number needed to provide homes for employees
of the proposed commercial, industrial and institutional uses.</TE>
<TE>   In the re-use of military bases, affordable housing is supposed to
be considered a priority. Therefore, it's especially dismaying that
development proposed for this precious public resource will result in
more pressure on what little existing housing is affordable to Orange
County workers. Problems associated with Orange County's housing
shortage and jobs/housing imbalance have received considerable
coverage in this newspaper. Irvine imports tens of thousands of
commuting workers each day. Now [the city plans] to make it worse!</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the problem is the proposal to minimize environmental
review. So while Irvine gets a park, surrounding cities and areas
beyond will get increased residential overcrowding, increased
commuter traffic, increased traffic congestion, increased air
pollution and increased pressure to build.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Larry Agran's deal with the Navy has as many deceptions as
those found in Measures F and W. He claims his park plan will be paid
for by developers. Hogwash! Those businessmen are far too smart to be
stuck with that liability. The taxpaying public won't be happy to
finance it either.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder what kind of countywide fervor will be created when
citizens discover what developers and city officials have in mind for
the 18,450 acres of buffer zone surrounding the El Toro property.
Created to keep noise at a minimum when El Toro was an airport, it
will no longer be necessary to have it remain a no-home zone.</TE>
<TE>   For those who think Irvine's "Northern Sphere" home project will
create enormous pollution and traffic congestion problems, they
haven't seen anything yet! While thousands upon thousands of new
homes on that former huge buffer-zone might be a developer's dream,
it is most people's worst nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   The airport, which would solve problems instead of creating them,
is beginning to sound more and more attractive. Can we vote again?</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Bauer</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The city of Irvine and the Navy's plans for the El Toro property
are both premature and deceptive.</TE>
<TE>   Premature, because until the lawsuit against Measure W is decided,
the zoning for that property might not be consistent with the
so-called park plan.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is deceptive because, just like Measure W, it does not
have concrete ways to pay for the projects without using public tax
funds. Chances are, taxpayers will be asked to foot the bill and if
they don't, well there goes the elusive park plan.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie O'Neil</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although the airport issue has been described as already settled,
this is not quite the case. There are two lawsuits against Measure W,
one in California and the other in federal court, which must be
decided first. Another issue in limbo is the city of Irvine's plan to
annex the 4,700-acre base. This will have to wait until Irvine meets
state conditions for annexation. ... The provisions of Measure W
apply only to county land, not to Irvine. [The city] has no legal
obligation to comply with the provisions of Measure W and need not
create a "Great Park."</TE>

<TE>   Re "El Toro Plan With Promise," July 26:</TE>
<TE>   On behalf of 600,000 residents of Orange County whose quality of
life would be destroyed by a commercial airport at El
Toro--regardless of its size--we thank The Times for its sound advice
to the county and airport proponents: " ... join as partners in this
new effort [to create a 4,000-acre Great Park] or give up and go
home."</TE>
<TE>   We have many people to thank for crafting this fabulous agreement
between Irvine and the Navy--first and foremost Mayor Larry Agran,
who led the Irvine negotiating team; the U.S. Navy for deciding to
end the war over El Toro's reuse; the residents of South County, who
voted 90% to repeal Measure A and approve the Great Park; and L.A.
Times staff writer Evan Halper for his excellent, complete and
accurate reporting of this landmark event.</TE>
<TE>   Finally--and most importantly--the agreement between Irvine and
the Navy means there will never be a commercial airport at El Toro.</TE>

<LD>Re "Friends of Free Speech, a Newspaper Needs You," July 28:</LD>
<LD>   I always have mixed feelings when I read commentary such as Paul
Pflueger's.</LD>
<LD>   On the one hand I want to praise the newspaper for printing
something about free speech. On the other hand, I want to berate the
newspaper for talking out of both sides of its corporate mouth about
the issue.</LD>
<TE>   Free speech truly is under assault. There's nothing new in this;
this has been going on since there has been speech. Most intelligent
people and most major newspapers immediately get their hackles up
when government tries to stop free speech--and, well they should.
However, when our private sector bigots and free speech haters try to
stop free speech, newspapers, including The Times, give them free ink
to push their tyranny.</TE>
<TE>   The real danger, right now, right here, to free speech is coming
not from government but from private sector hate hunters who quickly
try to shut people up by calling their exercise of free speech "hate"
or "racism" or any of a number of other such terms, when, in many
cases, the exercise of free speech contains no racial hatred but
simply takes on controversial subjects. Sure, the hate hunters also
have free-speech rights, but many times they are acting like the
witch hunters of old.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, we should make sure high school reporters and editors have
the right to their free speech, unencumbered by school officials. But
we also need to make sure that adults have their free speech rights,
unencumbered by hate hunters who in the name of political correctness
think they can tell people what is acceptable speech and what isn't.</TE>
<TE>   H. Millard</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The California Education Code goes out of its way to protect the
First Amendment rights of students. The law is very clear about what
adults may censor in school publications: that which is deemed
libelous or obscene, encourages students to break the law or
threatens to disrupt the orderly operation of the school.</TE>
<TE>   Part of a journalism advisor's responsibility is to teach respect
for the freedom of expression that is guaranteed by our Constitution
and is fundamental to a democracy. The Garden Grove newspaper advisor
should fight for her students' right to express dissenting opinions
and for her own job.</TE>

<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Amid heavy security, including police toting machine guns, three
Islamic militants were arraigned Saturday on charges of carrying out
the June car bombing outside the U.S. Consulate here that killed 12
people.</LD>
<LD>   The three, plus a member of the Pakistan Rangers paramilitary
police, also were arraigned on charges of plotting to kill President
Pervez Musharraf during a visit to this sprawling city of 12 million
people.</LD>
<LD>   The trials of both cases are to begin Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, has been the site of three
high-profile incidents of violence this year: the consulate bombing,
a May suicide bombing outside the Sheraton Hotel that killed 11
French engineers and three others; and the January kidnapping of Wall
Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, who was later slain.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects were brought to the closed-door arraignment at the
Anti-Terrorism Court in an armored personnel carrier. Officers with
machine guns were deployed around the building.</TE>
<TE>   The three charged in both cases are Mohammed Imran, Mohammed Hanif
and Mohammed Ashraf. Imran is identified as the leader of the
Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen al-Almi extremist group and the other two are
thought to be officers in the group.</TE>
<TE>   Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen al-Almi, a splinter group of
Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen, or Movement of Holy Warriors, reportedly has
ties to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on the charges of planning and executing the bombing,
the three could face the death penalty. Six other suspects have been
identified but remain at large.</TE>
<TE>   Imran, Hanif, Ashraf and Rangers' inspector Waseem Akhtar were
arraigned on charges of conspiracy, terrorism, attempt to murder, and
usage of a lethal explosive in the plot to kill Musharraf. The charge
of terrorism carries the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The six men being sought in connection with the bombing also are
suspects in the alleged plot against Musharraf. The plotters
allegedly parked an explosives-rigged pickup truck along the route of
Musharraf's motorcade during an April visit; the same truck is
believed to have been used in the consulate bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has incurred the wrath of Islamic militants because of
his cooperation with the U.S.-led war on terrorism.</TE>

<LD>Plans for a global lottery to help fill United Nations' coffers have
taken a step forward and could become reality within 18 months, said
former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, a U.N. peace broker who is
promoting the idea.</LD>
<LD>   Ahtisaari said the U.N. has agreed to a pilot project with the
World Lottery Assn., and if final approval is received, it could be
running by late 2003. He gave no details about how it would operate.</LD>
<LD>   The plan was originally proposed by Ghana in 1972 but failed to
win sufficient backing.</LD>

<HD>Europeans See New Legal Tender as Leaving Them Lighter in
the Wallet</HD>
<DH>Analysts say switch to euro is partly to blame for
inflation in 12-nation zone</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Lorena Fidati says this year's switch to using euro coins and notes
instead of the lira has triggered sharp price jumps that have
devastated her personal budget.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not just me," the 29-year-old beautician said. "All my
friends also run out of money around the 15th of the month."</LD>
<LD>   Emiliano Guerra, 30, a public relations employee who buys most of
the groceries for his family, is also complaining. "Shopping costs
went up 40%," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Plenty of people feel this way. Yet according to government
statistics, inflation in Italy has run at about 2.2% for the last
year.</TE>
<TE>   This is roughly average for the 12-country euro zone, with
analysts saying the changeover has caused up to one-quarter of the
increase in prices. That pins blame on the new European common
currency for a significant portion of inflation, but it's not in the
same league as the wallet-crushing disaster that many people say they
feel.</TE>
<TE>   Even as governments and many economists generally express
satisfaction that the switch has gone smoothly, consumers are crying
foul. Many people believe that prices have not only been rounded up
but that merchants have taken advantage of the changeover to
try--without much success--to slip price increases past consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "People are not blind. They see that prices have increased--they
see it every morning when they do their shopping at the market," said
Carlo Pileri, president of ADOC, an Italian consumer association.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany, angry shoppers have even coined a new word: "teuro,"
created from euro and teuer, the German word for "expensive."</TE>
<TE>   "The teuro makes me furious," said Elke Luetzenkirch, a customer
at Berlin's KaDeWe department store. She blames euro-related
inflation for taking about $150 a month from her wallet and says
she's thinking about selling her car to help make ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   Greece has long gotten by without small coins. The smallest was 20
drachma, and even it was rare, so prices were routinely rounded off
to the nearest 50 drachmas, about 14 cents. Euro coins come as small
as 1 cent--equal almost exactly to a U.S. penny.</TE>
<TE>   Since the introduction of the euro, supermarket cashiers in Athens
have routinely rounded upward to the nearest 10 cents.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm made to feel cheap, but I have to argue when I see the grocer
rounding off each item upward as he weighs it, and then rounding
upward again when he totals all the items," said Vasso Pritsa, an
Athens homemaker. "In that way he's making an extra profit on each
item and another on the entire purchase."</TE>
<TE>   A waitress in an Athens cafe that sells coffee rounded up to three
euros complained that "they've rounded up everything, but they
haven't rounded up our wages."</TE>
<TE>   Some people tend to believe that prices have increased even when
they haven't. Scholars at Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich
reported an experiment in which participants were given two menus for
a restaurant, one in German marks and one in euros. On the euro menu,
some items were slightly more expensive and others slightly cheaper
than on the mark menu, but the cost of an average dinner was the
same. Of the 2,000 participants, 90% said a dinner would cost more
from the euro menu.</TE>
<TE>   Some businesses are trying to fight this psychological effect. In
the Berlin suburb of Spandau, Restaurant Kolk stills hands out old
menus with the prices only in marks. The switch-over to euros is done
when the bill is paid--and it's calculated with the exact rate of
1.96 marks per euro.</TE>
<TE>   Luigi Campiglio, an economics professor at the Catholic University
of Milan, said that another reason for the gap between people's
perceptions and official statistics is that the uneven inflation of
the last seven months hits different social groups in different ways.</TE>
<TE>   "Our statistical methods were conceived for an industrial world
with standardized goods and rather homogenous prices, while we live
in a service economy where diversity is the rule," Campiglio said.
"Diversity applies to the products but also to the people buying the
products. It's increasing the probability that different social
groups will experience different inflation rates."</TE>
<TE>   Campiglio cited a British study in the 1970s showing that
inflation rates for retired people and for the general public weren't
significantly different. "I think if we replicated this study today,
we would find very different results," he said. "The lower-income
groups should be the most affected."</TE>
<TE>   In Ireland, where inflation is running at about 4.5%, the main
government economic advisory agency, Forfas, did a study on the
effect of the euro on consumers. "It shows that there is anecdotal
evidence of [euro-related] price increases in some non-trade services
like pubs, restaurants, doctors, hairdressers, dentists and
opticians," said Dermot O'Conghaile, who helped prepare the report.</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda Quintana, a spokeswoman for Spain's Confederation of
Housewives, Consumers and Users, said that before the changeover, "we
had worried about other things, such as correct change or becoming
familiar with the new notes."</TE>
<TE>   "But surprisingly, the No. 1 complaint is rising prices," she
said. The "everything for 100 pesetas" shops changed to "everything
for a euro" shops, a 66% leap, she complained.</TE>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>North and South Korea agreed today to restart high-level talks next
week, getting their stalled reconciliation process back on track, a
joint statement said.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement, reached at a three-day meeting at North Korea's
Diamond Mountain resort, called for the two sides to hold
Cabinet-level talks in Seoul, the South's capital, Aug. 12-14, the
statement said.</LD>
<LD>   Next week's talks, the seventh such meeting since 2000, will focus
on reunions of families separated since the Korean War, a plan to
reconnect a cross-border rail line and joint economic projects in the
impoverished North, the statement said. In addition, North Korea
agreed to participate in the 14th Asian Games to be held in Busan,
South Korea, in September.</LD>

<HD>Legionnaires' Disease Kills 1 in Britain; 38 Ill</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BARROW IN FURNESS, Britain</DL>
<LD>Confirmed cases of deadly Legionnaires' disease rose to 39 on
Saturday in Britain's worst outbreak in 17 years, with one man dead
and dozens more cases expected, health officials said.</LD>
<LD>   An 89-year-old man died Friday, the first fatality in the outbreak
at Barrow in Furness in Cumbria on England's northwestern coast.
Officials said more deaths were possible.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said an air-conditioning unit in an entertainment
complex in Barrow was believed to be the source, and they urged
people not to panic.</LD>
<TE>   "If the source is where we think it is, then control measures have
now been taken and it doesn't pose a further threat to public
health," John Ashton, public health director for the region, told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   But by Saturday evening, the number of confirmed cases had jumped
to 39 from 19, with experts saying as many as 130 people could be
infected.</TE>
<TE>   Bacteriologist Hugh Pennington said Legionnaires' is "the nastiest
bug you can catch in the environment."</TE>
<TE>   The symptoms are at first flu-like, followed by fever and chills,
then a dry cough.</TE>
<TE>   "In past outbreaks, as many as 20% of people who've been infected
with it" have died, he told BBC television.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar</DL>
<LD>A mysterious flu-like illness has killed more than 150 people in
Madagascar in the last two weeks, the Health Ministry has reported.</LD>
<LD>   The ministry said in a statement released Friday that it had sent
a team of researchers to villages in the south of this Indian Ocean
island to identify the disease, which causes a severe headache and
chest pains.</LD>
<LD>   According to the statement, 89 people have died in the village of
Alakamisy Ambohimaha, 90 miles south of the capital, Antananarivo, in
the last two weeks. An additional 64 people have died in Ikongo, 186
miles south of Antananarivo.</LD>
<TE>   The Health Ministry said about 450 people had been diagnosed as
suffering from the illness, and health officials fear that it could
spread further.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the people who died had been unable to reach a hospital or
health center, or had relied on traditional herbal remedies that
failed to cure them.</TE>
<TE>   Madagascar is just emerging from six months of political crisis
that devastated the already shaky economy.</TE>

<HD>Alongside Israeli Siege, a New Hope for Talks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Israeli soldiers pried open boarded-up shops and searched houses here
Saturday, pressing their latest siege to root out militant cells that
Israel says are responsible for recent attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the crackdown, high-level talks between Israel and the
Palestinians were expected this week--possibly including a meeting
involving Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, officials and Israeli news
reports said.</LD>
<LD>   Bulldozers piled up soil and rubble to block the entrances to
Nablus' Old City while tanks and armored vehicles crawled through its
empty streets, enforcing a strict curfew.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses said several people were arrested Saturday in addition
to 50 rounded up Friday, the first day of the crackdown that followed
two bombings in Jerusalem last week.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with hammers and metal bars, Israeli soldiers wound through
narrow alleys, opening shuttered shop fronts and searching houses.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the southern West Bank city of Hebron, Israeli
troops killed a Palestinian man, Palestinian witnesses said. They
said the troops were reimposing a curfew at the end of the day and
shot 40-year-old Abdel Rahim Tawil in the head while he was driving a
truck. The army said it was checking the report.</TE>
<TE>   Israel launched its latest crackdown after Wednesday's bombing at
Jerusalem's Hebrew University, which killed seven people, including
five Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was revenge
for an Israeli airstrike on Gaza City that killed the Islamic group's
military leader and 14 others, nine of them children.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials say Nablus has replaced nearby Jenin as the main
hub of Palestinian terrorist cells responsible for attacks in the
last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the recent attacks and Israel's stepped-up siege, Israeli
officials suggested Saturday that Sharon was willing to meet with the
new Palestinian interior minister, Abdel Razak Yehiyeh.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be; it depends on the developments in the situation,"
said Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's Channel Two television and Army Radio said the meeting
could come this week.</TE>
<TE>   Yehiyeh, meanwhile, said he is also planning to meet with Israeli
Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer before a Palestinian delegation
heads to Washington on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Talks on implementing cease-fires in certain Palestinian areas
could occur in the coming days, said a spokesman for Ben-Eliezer.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has not met with top Palestinian officials for months,
although his dovish foreign minister, Shimon Peres, has held several
meetings recently with Yehiyeh and the new Palestinian finance
minister, Salam Fayed.</TE>
<TE>   Peres plans to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Monday in Cairo, an advisor to the foreign minister said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GAUHATI, India</DL>
<LD>Ten more people have drowned in Bangladesh, raising the death toll
from South Asian monsoon rains to 560, relief officials said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The monsoon floods in the last month have destroyed crops and
farms and killed hundreds throughout India, Nepal and Bangladesh. The
death toll has been highest in Nepal, where rains and mudslides have
killed an estimated 269 people, according to Nepal's Interior
Ministry.</LD>
<LD>   In Bangladesh, six children and four men drowned Friday in three
districts about 150 miles north of Dhaka, the capital, bringing the
death toll to 133, relief officials said. Nearly one-third of the
country has been flooded since last month, displacing or stranding
nearly 6 million people, relief officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Many flood victims have lost homes, crops, livestock and farm
work. Schools have closed because they are being used as shelters for

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal</DL>
<LD>Government soldiers raided a Maoist rebel base in eastern Nepal on
Saturday, killing at least 15 guerrillas--including eight female
fighters, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   One soldier was wounded in the ensuing gun battle, and two
civilians were injured in the cross-fire, government spokesman
Bhupendra Prasad Poudel said.</LD>
<LD>   The Maoist camp was near the village of Shailejguswor in Dolkha
district, about 75 miles east of Katmandu, the capital, officials
said. State-run television aired army footage of the slain rebels.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, 12 rebels were reported killed in an attack at a
rebel camp in the jungle near Rajkot village, about 310 miles west of
Katmandu. Casualty reports could not be independently verified
because gun battles often occur in remote areas closed by
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Rebels began fighting government forces in 1996 in a bid to
abolish the constitutional monarchy.</TE>

<HD>Nigeria Again Delays Elections</HD>
<DH>Africa: Postponement marks setback for democratic process
in violence-torn nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LAGOS, Nigeria</DL>
<LD>Amid political wrangling and fears of violence, President Olusegun
Obasanjo said Saturday that nationwide municipal elections set for
next weekend would be postponed for the second time in six months.</LD>
<LD>   The vote, which would be the first election since military rule
ended in 1999, had originally been scheduled for April. No new date
has been set.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking on a radio call-in show, Obasanjo gave few reasons for
postponing the balloting, saying only that authorities in Nigeria's
36 states agreed that electoral officials were unprepared and
electoral lists were not ready.</LD>
<TE>   "The governors have decided by consensus that Aug. 10 is not a
realistic date," Obasanjo said. "Preparations are not complete."</TE>
<TE>   The postponement marks a major setback for the democratic process
in oil-producing Nigeria, a country of 126 million that has not
managed a successful transition between elected governments since
independence from Britain in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   The delay could also affect presidential, national and
gubernatorial elections early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Any election would take place against a background of Nigeria's
worst cycle of violence in decades.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 10,000 people have died in three years. Obasanjo's
victory in 1999 ended 15 years of military dictatorship but released
an outpouring of long-suppressed grievances, leading to bloody
outbreaks of ethnic and religious clashes across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Political unrest has surged since Obasanjo declared his reelection
bid in April, and the president has expressed fears that violence
nationwide could derail the municipal voting. Local leadership
tussles within Obasanjo's ruling People's Democratic Party have been
marred by violence between rival factions.</TE>
<TE>   Some parties have complained of being excluded from the upcoming
vote, and electoral officials repeatedly have delayed compiling voter
lists.</TE>
<TE>   A national appeals court last week opened the door for dozens of
new unregistered parties to vote after ruling that Nigeria's
electoral commission had used illegal criteria to disqualify them.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELFAST, Northern Ireland</DL>
<LD>Catholic mail carriers went on strike Saturday in Londonderry over
fears they could be targeted in revenge for the latest killing of a
Protestant.</LD>
<LD>   In a related development, police released without charge five
suspected Irish Republican Army dissidents who had been arrested on
suspicion of involvement in Thursday's killing of David Caldwell, a
Protestant who had been helping to renovate a British army facility
in Londonderry.</LD>
<LD>   Caldwell, 51, died after picking up a booby-trapped lunch box. It
was the first lethal attack to be blamed on IRA dissidents in four
years. In response, Protestant militants threatened a "military
response" against Catholics.</LD>
<TE>   Union leaders representing Royal Mail workers in Londonderry said
one of their Catholic members who delivers mail on the city's
predominantly Protestant east side had been issued a death threat
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   They decided no mail would be delivered until after an emergency
meeting Monday.</TE>

<HD>No Place Like Home, German Vacationers Find</HD>
<DH>Leisure: Domestic resorts in eastern states are booming,
and overseas destinations are off the maps, largely due to terrorism
fears.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BINZ, Germany</DL>
<LD>If every cloud--be it the threat of terrorism, an economic downturn
or labor strife in Europe's Sun Belt--has a silver lining, then the
flip side of misfortune in Germany is shining just where it's most
needed.</LD>
<LD>   German vacationers are staying close to home this summer in
numbers so significant that domestic resorts in the depressed eastern
states are booming. Conversely, charter tour operators serving the
usually swarmed Mediterranean destinations are reporting double-digit
drops in their income.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign tourism has flagged throughout the developed world in the
wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In this peripatetic nation,
the search for safer diversions is bringing flocks of well-heeled
travelers to newly restored Victorian spa towns and nature parks in
regions that were neglected or off limits in the Communist era.</LD>
<TE>   One of the country's poorest states and hardly a household name
among international travelers, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania suddenly
finds itself in the sweet spot of summer tourism as Germans
rediscover its Baltic Sea bathing spots and pristine lake country.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't get the help we need in the restaurant or housekeeping,
and we're booked out through the rest of the season," says Antje
Maerker, deputy director of the Binz Kurhaus hotel, who is happy with
the renovated spa's success but worried about maintaining good
service.</TE>
<TE>   The job boom, even if seasonal, is welcome news in this
northeastern state, which suffers from nearly 18% unemployment and an
exodus of young workers. Last month, the state employment office
reported more than 100 unfilled positions on the Baltic Sea island of
Ruegen alone.</TE>
<TE>   Major charter operators serving Majorca, Tunisia, the Canary
Islands and other once-popular destinations are carrying about 15%
fewer vacationers this summer. The Forsa polling institute reports
that one-third of Germans plan domestic car trips this summer instead
of their usual overseas sojourns. Even Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
opted for a break at his Hanover townhouse rather than his
traditional Tuscan vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the economic boost, the tempered wanderlust is also
helping overcome assumptions that eastern resorts are inferior to the
watering holes of the west.</TE>
<TE>   Like most middle-aged Germans, shop owner Helmut Prignitz is proud
of his stamp-filled passport. He talks fondly of his Mediterranean
respites and a five-week U.S. tour from Atlantic City to
Disneyland--but with a been-there, done-that indifference now that
he's discovered Germany's own attractions.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here for the first time a few years ago and was amazed at
how much of the natural beauty remains intact," the Hamburg native
says, alluding to the four decades of Communist rule, during which
the environment suffered from reckless industrialization. "People are
afraid of Al Qaeda now, so they're not going abroad. I, for one,
wouldn't go to an Arab country at the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "But, like a lot of people, I've been surprised about what has
been in our own backyards all these years."</TE>
<TE>   In the Mueritz lake region, hotel owners and boat rental shops in
the resort of Waren also report land-office business this summer,
even though the weather has been wet and cold compared with last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "Our promotional materials claim this is the part of Germany with
the most sunny days, but it has really gone off the rails this year,"
Waren Mayor Guenter Rhein says as rain lashes his office windows.
"But people don't come here for sunbathing. They come for the hiking
and the hot springs and the boating, and now they are coming in
droves because it is a place where they can relax in safety."</TE>
<TE>   The number of hotel beds has doubled in the last year, yet Waren's
22 guest houses are booked solid for the season, Rhein says, and not
just because of German hesitation to board aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "The image of eastern resorts has been turned on its head in the
last 12 years," the mayor says. "You read so much about the billions
the government has invested in rebuilding the east, and in places
like this Germans can see that they have really gotten something for
their money."</TE>
<TE>   After a $100-million restoration, Waren's historic harbor has
recovered its 19th century charm, with pastel-painted townhouses
standing stately guard over the marina and ever-larger yachts and
sailboats moored there. As with most restoration projects in eastern
venues, the federal government financed the improvements in hopes of
just the sort of tourism upturn that is finally taking place.</TE>
<TE>   At the Hotel Ingeborg, a quaint harbor-side hostelry, owner
Juergen Grueneklee serves as a post-Communist poster boy for
entrepreneurial spirit. Although he could expand from his current 28
rooms to satisfy growing demand, he says he wants to remain small
enough to greet all guests by name when they come down to breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   As head of the local hotel association, he has spearheaded
services aimed at what he calls his bread-and-butter market, the
45-and-older crowd looking for a few days of active recreation.</TE>
<TE>   "I call them 'second life' people--those whose houses are paid for
and their kids are out of the house and they have both the time and
the money to travel," Grueneklee says. "This year, instead of Tunisia
or Majorca, they are discovering the treasures of their own country."</TE>
<TE>   A favorite destination for the hordes of German travelers keen on
history and culture, Tunisia has been erased from the tourism map
since an April terrorist bombing killed 14 visiting Germans. Spanish
and Italian resorts also are losing their usual business from Germans
because of strikes by service industry unions and newly enacted
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Though fear of terrorism is a key reason for eschewing faraway
travel this year, yacht charter owner Thomas Schultz contends that
the new euro currency is making his fellow Germans more aware of the
real costs of vacations in traditional escapes elsewhere in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "People can see more easily now what it really costs in other
countries, and the euro has made a lot of things more expensive,"
says Schultz, echoing claims of consumer watchdogs that the common
European currency has encouraged merchants to harmonize prices,
usually upward.</TE>
<TE>   Binz and Waren, like most eastern resorts, are considerably less
expensive than established rest spots in the west, such as the
Friesian Islands in the North Sea that stretch westward from the
Danish peninsula. But some recent visitors complain that you still
get what you pay for in the east.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cheap, but you can't get a decent meal. It's all pomme
frites and pizza," Berlin surgeon Steffan Tullius says of Usedom, the
island south of Ruegen. He also bemoans what can still be indifferent
service and the potbellied, beer-swilling patrons of resorts that aim
for the bargain-hunters.</TE>
<TE>   Ruegen and Usedom have been the greatest benefactors of the German
return to homeland vacations, posting 20% increases in overnight
stays this year, according to the state Tourism Board in Rostock.</TE>
<TE>   But their success is highlighting a persistent deficiency in the
eastern regions: highways capable of moving the expanding volume of
visitors. The less-than-80-mile stretch from Rostock to Binz can take
five hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Traffic has long been a problem in this area and especially in
times of bad weather," says Binz spa association spokeswoman Petra
Wolter. "When it rains and you can't go to the beach, what do you do?
You get in your car and drive to the other sights in the region."</TE>

<HD>Explosion on Bus in Israel Kills 7, Injures 20</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>An explosion ripped through a bus in northern Israel this morning,
killing at least seven people and wounding more than 20, Israeli
television reported.</LD>
<LD>   The force of the explosion tore off the top of the bus, which
originated in the northern city of Haifa. Those wounded in the blast,
which took place in the Galilee area, were taken to the city of
Safed.</LD>
<LD>   The bus stopped at many locations in northern Israel and was a
popular way for soldiers to commute, a spokesman for the bus company
said.</LD>
<TE>   Schlo Cohen, a witness, said several bodies could be seen at the
side of the bus. The fire on the bus took some time to extinguish.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very distressing scene," northern region Police Chief
Yehuda Solomon told Israel Radio.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing came a day after Israeli soldiers pried open
boarded-up shops and searched houses in the West Bank city of Nablus,
pressing their latest siege to root out militant Palestinian cells
that Israel says are responsible for recent attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the crackdown, high-level talks between Israel and the
Palestinians were expected this week--possibly including a meeting
involving Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, officials and Israeli news
reports said.</TE>
<TE>   Bulldozers piled up soil and rubble to block the entrances to
Nablus' Old City while tanks and armored vehicles crawled through its
empty streets, enforcing a strict curfew.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said several people were arrested Saturday in addition
to 50 rounded up Friday, the first day of the crackdown that followed
two bombings in Jerusalem last week.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the southern West Bank city of Hebron, Israeli
troops killed a Palestinian man, Palestinian witnesses said. They
said the troops were reimposing a curfew at the end of the day and
shot 40-year-old Abdel Rahim Tawil in the head while he was driving a
truck. The army said it was checking the report.</TE>
<TE>   Israel launched its latest crackdown after Wednesday's bombing at
Jerusalem's Hebrew University, which killed seven people, including
five Americans.Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it
was revenge for an Israeli airstrike on Gaza City that killed the
Islamic group's military leader and 14 others, nine of them children.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials say Nablus has replaced nearby Jenin as the main
hub of Palestinian terrorist cells responsible for attacks in the
last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the recent attacks and Israel's stepped-up siege, Israeli
officials suggested Saturday that Sharon was willing to meet with the
new Palestinian interior minister, Abdel Razak Yehiyeh.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be; it depends on the developments in the situation,"
said Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin. Israel's Channel Two
television and Army Radio said the meeting could come this week.</TE>
<TE>   Yehiyeh, meanwhile, said he is also planning to meet with Israeli
Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer before a Palestinian delegation
heads to Washington on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Talks on implementing cease-fires in certain Palestinian areas
could occur in the coming days, said a spokesman for Ben-Eliezer.</TE>

<HD>Pakistani Opposition Leader Resigns</HD>
<DH>Politics: Ex-premier quits as party chief and candidate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif stepped down Saturday as
leader of one of Pakistan's major opposition parties, essentially
eliminating himself as a challenger to President Pervez Musharraf.</LD>
<LD>   Sharif's party, the Pakistan Muslim League, elected his younger
brother, Shehbaz, as its leader and its candidate for head of
government in October legislative elections.</LD>
<LD>   Party spokesman Sadique Farooq said the move was necessary because
Musharraf has refused to allow Nawaz Sharif to return home and
contest the Oct. 10 elections.</LD>
<TE>   Musharraf, an army general, ousted Sharif in a bloodless coup in
1999 and sent him to Saudi Arabia after the deposed prime minister
was convicted of corruption and conspiracy to hijack Musharraf's
plane. Sharif remained leader of the Pakistan Muslim League, one of
the two main opposition parties.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike another exiled former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, who
leads the opposition Pakistan People's Party and has been living in
London, Sharif had refrained from publicly criticizing Musharraf. He
retained a degree of support and was seen as a potential threat to
Musharraf if he returned for the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has pushed for several constitutional amendments ahead
of the elections, some of which appear aimed specifically at
undermining the influence of Sharif and Bhutto.</TE>
<TE>   The amendments include term limits for prime ministers and a rule
to ban those convicted of crimes from holding elected office. The
amendments have not been approved.</TE>

<DH>Politics: President seeks a referendum on statehood. His
remarks come as China, which claims the territory, faces a leadership
reshuffle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian cranked up the heat on his
mainland rivals Saturday by declaring that China and Taiwan are
separate countries and that the island should hold a referendum on
independence.</LD>
<LD>   Chen's remarks were the most serious such verbal provocation since
his predecessor pushed the archenemies to the brink of war three
years ago by arguing that they should deal with each other on a
"state-to-state" basis.</LD>
<LD>   Beijing did not immediately respond to Chen's comments, which were
made during a videoconference with Taiwanese living in Japan. But
observers said the statements were bound to enrage his Communist
foes. They consider the island part of China and have expressed a
willingness to reclaim it by force if necessary.</LD>
<TE>   "If he really supports an independence referendum, that means he
is declaring war on the mainland," said Jia Qingguo, associate dean
at Beijing University's School of International Studies. "That would
be a disaster for the people of Taiwan."</TE>
<TE>   No one seemed clear about why Chen picked this moment to push
Beijing's buttons. However, politics on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait might have been a factor.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said that Chen has been downplaying his radical
independence stance since becoming president two years ago. But
according to these observers, he has now consolidated his power
within the Democratic Progressive Party and feels safer about
courting the independence vote.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been painfully restraining himself. At a certain time, he
would explode. This seems to be the time," said Shen Dingli, an
international affairs expert at Shanghai's Fudan University.</TE>
<TE>   Chen also might have been bluffing.</TE>
<TE>   He knows that Beijing faces one of its biggest leadership
reshuffles in five decades of Communist rule, scheduled to take place
this fall at the 16th Communist Party Congress. During this sensitive
period, the authorities are unlikely to take any drastic military
action that would jeopardize social stability. According to this
view, there could be no better time to ruffle Beijing's feathers.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, the two sides' standoff persists even as
cross-strait economic ties are growing ever stronger. China just beat
out the United States to become Taiwan's No. 1 export market, and
millions of people from the island now live and work on the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Yet political tensions continue to define the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Beijing made much of establishing diplomatic ties with
Nauru, a tiny South Pacific island nation that used to recognize
Taiwan. China requires any country that wants to establish such
connections with it to cut all formal ties with Taiwan. Chen
responded to the symbolic setback by warning Beijing that if
relations didn't improve, Taiwan might "walk down its own Taiwanese
road."</TE>
<TE>   That remark was interpreted as a veiled threat to declare
independence. But it was not considered as serious or specific as
what he said Saturday: "Simply put, with Taiwan and China on each
side of the strait, each side is a country. This needs to be clear."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, analysts don't believe that Beijing will respond
with the same kind of saber-rattling as in 1999, after then-President
Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan escalated tensions with his "state-to-state"
comment. But that remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "To call this a turning point now is too early," Jia said. "It
depends on what he does next."</TE>

<HD>Beasts From China May Prove to Be a Burden for the Kabul
Zoo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Two lions, two bears, a wolf and about a dozen other wild animals are
preparing to journey to Afghanistan as a Chinese safari park plays
Noah to the war-ravaged country's ark.</LD>
<LD>   The well-intended gesture, however, has provoked an outcry from
international animal rights advocates, who argue that the Kabul Zoo
in the Afghan capital is in no condition to accommodate these furry
peace ambassadors.</LD>
<LD>   "To send these animals to Kabul now flies in the face of
everything the Chinese government has done for conservation," said
John Walsh, international project director for the London-based World
Society for the Protection of Animals. "It's not fair to the animals.
It will subject them to a lifetime of cruelty and suffering."</LD>
<TE>   The Chinese donors say that their government has stayed out of the
effort and that their decision to send the creatures was based on
assurances from Kabul that they will be adequately cared for.</TE>
<TE>   "Foreigners overemphasize the material conditions," said Yi Feng,
a manager at Beijing's Badaling Safari Animal World, which is
supplying the animals. "It may not be as nice as it is here, but
these animals are spiritual symbols of life and bravery. They mean a
lot to the Afghan people."</TE>
<TE>   Inspiration for the gift came from the death in January of Marjan,
the grenade-blinded lion who had become a symbol of Afghanistan's
suffering.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't even have to think," Yi said. "We just wanted to send
them a replacement lion."</TE>
<TE>   Decades of war have left the Kabul Zoo with more stuffed animals
than live ones. Most of the latter were either killed by bombs or
eaten by fighters of the Taliban, the hard-line Islamic regime that
the U.S. helped depose last fall.</TE>
<TE>   The offer from China was too good to refuse. In fact, Kabul
responded with a wish list of 22 animals, including some deer, blue
peacocks and wild pigs.</TE>
<TE>   "We are totally against the notion that we can't care for these
animals," said Abdul Basir Hotak, the consul general of the Afghan
Embassy in the Chinese capital. "The Kabul Zoo is ready to receive
animals. We are very optimistic about lasting peace, and the Afghan
people are very determined to rehabilitate and reconstruct
everything."</TE>
<TE>   That may well be the case down the road, critics say, but sending
wild animals now is premature. The zoo is still struggling with basic
infrastructure issues such as water, electricity, food and medical
supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Animal lovers the world over have donated an estimated half a
million dollars to help restore the Kabul Zoo, according to Walsh.
But the money is earmarked for the care of existing animals and for
turning the zoo into a center for conservation education. A flood of
new animals from China would overwhelm the system and do the
creatures more harm than good, he contended.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the zoo was destroyed. The buildings that are left are
concrete and iron bars, which is not the modern zoo concept today,"
said Walsh, who was in Afghanistan early this year helping to rebuild
the facilities. "If the lions get into a fight, there isn't even a
vet there to tranquilize them in order to treat them.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't understand why the Chinese government doesn't take notice
of what the professionals around the world are telling them."</TE>
<TE>   Neither the Badaling park nor its partner, the China Wildlife
Conservation Assn., a nongovernmental organization, has sent its own
staff to inspect the Kabul Zoo. Although they know about the general
resistance to the plan, they claim to be in the dark about specific
evidence that their animals could be harmed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that we are not open to international opinion, it's that
we haven't heard any," said Zhao Shengli, the project director at the
conservation association.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the enlisted Chinese animals have already been put in
quarantine pending a direct flight to Kabul this month. But Zhao said
his group would consider postponing the move if it learned that the
Kabul Zoo isn't safe.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese critics are also questioning the timing and wisdom of the
donation.</TE>
<TE>   "If we want to help Afghanistan, we could give them something
else," said Mang Ping, a researcher with Friends of Nature, a
Beijing-based environmental nonprofit group. "But an animal is a
living thing. Unless you can absolutely guarantee their safety, we
really shouldn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Wang Shuan has mixed feelings about the gift. The 24-year-old
zookeeper bottle-fed the pair of 3-year-old Kabul-bound lions. After
their mother abandoned them, Wang fed the cubs every two hours for 12
hours a day until they could eat meat.</TE>
<TE>   Wang and other zookeepers named the male cub Zhuang Zhuang,
Chinese for "Strong Strong," because he was a weak baby. They called
the lioness Kai Ni, after another caretaker's daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, I was very sad," said Wang, who said the park
has been inundated with visitor queries about the logic of sending
animals to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's become such a big deal. They will serve as symbols of
the friendship between our two countries," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I wish I could push their departure date back, until
conditions there improve."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Ni was recently on assignment in Beijing.</TE>

<HD>Stephen G. Cary, 86; Quaker Humanitarian</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stephen G. Cary, a leading Quaker who led public-service work camps
for conscientious objectors during World War II, has died at the age
of 86.</LD>
<LD>   Cary died Tuesday of unstated causes at his summer home in
Chatham, Mass., on Cape Cod.</LD>
<LD>   A resident of Haverford, Pa., Cary worked most of his career for
the American Friends Service Committee, the national Quaker
humanitarian organization. He led the group, holding the position
designated simply as clerk, from 1979 to 1991.</LD>
<TE>   During the war, Cary led two government-approved work camps, in
Elkton, Ore., and Big Flats, N.Y., for pacifists who performed
national service rather than being drafted into the military.</TE>
<TE>   A public television documentary on the subject, "The Good War and
Those Who Refused to Fight It," was shown this year. The program
described the government's provision for about 12,000 members of
historically pacifist denominations--including the Religious Society
of Friends, commonly called Quakers, and the Mennonites--to avoid
military service by performing duties in civilian work camps.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the conscientious objectors' manual labor on behalf of the
nation, they often experienced discrimination and taunts of being
unpatriotic. Cary, in the documentary, said the men performed the
labor without pay and without financial support for their families.</TE>
<TE>   He also described their make-work tasks as meaningless, likening
the assignments to "knitting all day and unraveling all night."</TE>
<TE>   Born to a Quaker family in Philadelphia in 1915, Stephen Grellet
Cary had the pacifist tradition stamped on him at an early age when
his father abruptly quit a good job because his company accepted a
military contract. When Cary received his draft notice in 1942, he
took conscientious objector status and spent the war in the civilian
work camps.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he headed the American Quaker relief operations in
Europe for three years, overseeing work in 10 countries. The effort
helped the service committee earn the Nobel Peace Prize in 1947,
along with the Friends Service Council, its British counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   Cary was also active in broader civil rights efforts. In 1968, he
was jailed for 15 days for civil disobedience for participating in a
Washington, D.C., demonstration organized by the Poor People's
Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In the conscientious objector documentary earlier this year, the
humanitarian Cary noted: "Every great change in expanding the
dimensions of human freedom has come from very small beginnings:
Somebody said no."</TE>
<TE>   Cary, who held a bachelor's degree from Haverford College and a
master's in international administration from Columbia University,
was named a vice president at Haverford in 1969. He served as acting
president in 1977-78, when the all-male college was preparing to
become coeducational.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Elizabeth; three children;
one sister; and seven grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>A 12-year-old Chinese girl missing for two days was found safe with
relatives on the East Coast early Saturday after disappearing from
her youth tour group, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   A tip provided to the FBI and forwarded to the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Department led investigators to Yukun Jia around 9 a.m.,
sheriff's spokeswoman Bronwyn Hogan said.</LD>
<LD>   "She is safe with relatives and in good spirits," said Hogan, who
would not reveal the city in which Yukun was found to protect the
girl's privacy and security.</LD>
<TE>   FBI spokesman Andrew Black confirmed Yukun was safe and said foul
play was not suspected.</TE>
<TE>   Hogan said Yukun's relatives met her at San Francisco
International Airport on Thursday, and they flew east together.</TE>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis told a group of labor union retirees and their
families Saturday that, if reelected, he would work to improve
education and job opportunities and to raise the standard of living
for California's immigrant population and working class.</LD>
<LD>   A mariachi band played as Davis entered the Pasadena Hilton Hotel
ballroom, where 400 people were dining as part of the annual retirees
luncheon of the Laborers International Union of North America Local
300. Davis was greeted with a standing ovation, and audience members
chanted, "Four more years!"</LD>
<LD>   "We have done an awful lot to make being a member of a working
class family an enjoyable experience," Davis said, stressing his
administration's efforts to provide more college grants and
scholarships to immigrant youths and to increase unemployment and
disability insurance and to improve the trade relationship with
Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   "I need your help, my friends, to be able to serve four more
years," said Davis, who will face Republican Bill Simon Jr. in the
Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   The union, which has endorsed Davis, has nearly 7,500 members. It
represents construction workers, custodians, shipbuilders,
hazardous-waste removal workers and other laborers. Nationwide, there
are 650 locals and 800,000 members in the organization, which will be
100 years old next year. Local 300 was established 29 years ago, said
Sergio Rascon, business manager for the union.</TE>
<TE>   "We need someone in government who understands the issues we
represent," such as workers' compensation and prevailing wages and
benefits, Rascon said.</TE>

<HD>Accused Father Haunted by Death of His Daughter</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: He faces a manslaughter charge. Police say
3-year-old was in van four hours.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For John Morgan, first came the screams from his wife, then the
silence, which now haunts their home, shorn of the "angel" who filled
their life with joy.</LD>
<LD>   "Our baby is dead!" Rosa Morgan, 40, screamed at him as he lay on
a hallway floor, he said. That same afternoon, the 52-year-old
motorcycle magazine freelance writer was arrested on suspicion of
having killed his 3-year-old daughter. Police said he had left
Angelina Rose inside the family van on a scorching summer day outside
their Fontana home. She was dead by the time her mother clutched her
and took her into the house. Police said the child had been in the
van about four hours.</LD>
<LD>   "It will haunt me forever," Morgan said of seeing his dead
daughter in his wife's arms. "I used to wake up to the sound of,
'Daddy, the sun's up, time to get up,' " a sobbing Morgan said.
"Because of my age when we had her, I used to worry whether she would
be old enough and strong enough to deal with my passing. I never
considered I would outlive her."</LD>
<TE>   How did this happen, Morgan said police asked him. On Saturday,
Morgan, again, tried to explain.</TE>
<TE>   Late Monday, Morgan said, he picked up a prescription to ease the
pain from a workplace injury he had suffered two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Early Tuesday morning, he took the pain medication. Later, he and
his daughter went to a supermarket to pick up some fast food. They
returned home about 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   As Angelina slept in her car seat, Morgan said, he took the
groceries in and then the food. That's the last thing he said he
remembers before he woke up, sprawled on the floor, his wife
screaming. It was about 5:20 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan said he had blacked out.</TE>
<TE>   Police could not verify Morgan's recollection of what had
happened. Toxicology test results have not been released.</TE>
<TE>   He has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and will be in
court Monday. His oldest son from a previous marriage, Johnny Morgan,
28, paid his $100,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   He said his wife of four years has moved out, and they haven't
spoken.</TE>
<TE>   He described a daughter who fit her name, Angelina Rose. Angel in
a rose--that's what her name means, he said. She would often ask him
to read her the story of Jonah and the whale. She liked trying to
ballet dance on the hardwood floor of the living room. She was on a
waiting list for ballet classes. She would put aside watching
cartoons so her dad could sit with her and watch what they called
"guy TV."</TE>
<TE>   Angelina learned to like "The Rockford Files," Morgan said.</TE>
<TE>   "She loved Winnie the Pooh, Clifford the Big Red Dog and God,"
said Morgan, who had been Angelina's primary caretaker since his
injury. His wife works as a nurse.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan said the support of his five adult children and his
Christian faith have kept him going.</TE>
<TE>   He said he thought at first of committing suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "But I know that only in heaven will I see my baby again. I'm in a
bad place now," Morgan said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the only way to see her again is if I endure this pain and
suffering."</TE>

<HD>Highway Proposal Hits Mono Lake Roadblock</HD>
<DH>Protest: A plan to make U.S. 395 safer along the scenic
shore runs afoul of critics who say it would create an eyesore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conflict is as endemic to primordial Mono Lake as the surreal spires
of calcium carbonate tufa that protrude from its briny surface. The
latest chapter involves a crooked highway.</LD>
<LD>   The genesis of the project was innocent enough: Residents around
the high desert lake wanted a safer highway shoulder for bicyclists,
an alternative to the hair-raising turnoff to the Old Marina and
wider pullouts where passing tourists could take in the sights.</LD>
<LD>   But here--where a bitter battle was successfully waged to stop Los
Angeles' Department of Water and Power from sucking the lake dry--a
well-oiled army of environmental protectors stands at the ready. When
the project ballooned into a $13-million overhaul that could threaten
precious wetlands and create an eyesore in the heart of a protected
scenic zone, they waged war.</LD>
<TE>   "There are two things to remember here: Just about anything is a
controversy in Mono Lake ... and don't leave anybody out," said Brad
Sturdivant, the California State Parks supervising ranger who
oversees the Mono Lake Tufa State Reserve.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Transportation widening project is
now being more closely evaluated and may be scaled down from its
original blueprint. And all sides say they are cooperating to come up
with a plan that improves road safety while protecting the precious
resource.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise came after a typically spirited campaign that
taught Caltrans a thing or two about doing business here.</TE>
<TE>   The Mono Lake Committee--which won the fight against the DWP after
16 painstaking years--called out its troops, flooding Gov. Gray
Davis' office last month with more than 2,000 pleas to scale back the
venture. Local officials with the U.S. Forest Service, California
State Parks and the Regional Water Quality Control Board piled on
too, favoring no development at all if a more sensitive alternative
weren't forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns ran so high that Caltrans director Jeffrey Morales and
State Water Resources Control Board Chairman Art Baggett paid a rare
visit to the little lakeside town of Lee Vining near the Sierra's
eastern slope last month to calm nerves.</TE>
<TE>   And all this before the project even entered its design phase. The
brouhaha offers a glimpse at just how touchy development can be at
Mono Lake--championed nationwide as an environmental success story.</TE>
<TE>   Since the State Water Resources Control Board ordered the DWP to
halt its water diversions and restore the lake's feeder streams and
waterfowl habitat, the comeback has exceeded expectations. The lake
level has risen by 8 feet, creek-side growths of cottonwoods and
willows have sprouted, and one species of bird that had disappeared
for decades has returned. But those delicate gains came after 16
years of court battles, and the lake's varied band of advocates isn't
about to see them reversed.</TE>
<TE>   "Caltrans is coming to see ... how much higher the bar is to do a
project here," said Mono Lake Committee Co-Executive Director
Geoffrey McQuilkin. "The number of citizens of California, and the
number of agencies that have an investment in protecting the lake and
seeing it restored, is not something they initially realized."</TE>
<TE>   The current flap began a decade ago, when residents asked the Mono
County Local Transportation Commission for modest changes to the
stretch of U.S. 395 that curls around the lake's western shore.</TE>
<TE>   But as the proposal lumbered its way through the state's
transportation bureaucracy, it ballooned into a substantial project
to significantly widen nearly three miles of highway, pushing it
toward the rising water's edge and adding bulky retaining walls or
fill slopes that would affect wetlands and scar the pristine view.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials said that they have worked closely with local
constituents and just want to make the roadway safer. The document
that has caused such alarm is only a rough outline of the proposal,
said Caltrans project manager Tim Shultz, based in nearby Bishop.</TE>
<TE>   Emotions have run so high that the agency in 2000 chose to
complete an environmental impact report--somewhat rare for highway
projects, Shultz said.</TE>
<TE>   Public Comments</TE>
<TE>   He expects to submit the draft to the Federal Highway
Administration in October. It probably will be released to the public
early next year, opening the door to formal public comments.
Ultimately, local officials could decide on no construction at all.</TE>
<TE>   All the opposition "caught us off guard," said Shultz, who moved
to the area 14 years ago because he loves the lake. "People are
coming out and saying, 'We don't like your draft EIR' before they've
even seen it. Usually people wait, see it and then say it's garbage,"
he joked.</TE>
<TE>   Shultz chalks up the tensions in part to confusion over the
Caltrans process.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't do design until we've been authorized to go forward and
design something, which doesn't happen until you evaluate the
impacts. You can see the Catch-22: How can you evaluate something
when you don't even know what you're going to do? They started to not
trust us."</TE>
<TE>   The scars of previous environmental battles are still healing at
the lake, a rest stop for 300 species of birds that feast on its
brine shrimp and alkali flies. (Though progress has been good, the
lake must still rise another 10 feet to meet the state-mandated
goal.)</TE>
<TE>   The story starts in 1941, when the DWP began diverting water from
four of the lake's five tributary streams to feed the booming Los
Angeles metropolis. The Mono Lake Committee was formed in 1978 by
students and scientists determined to save the dying lake.</TE>
<TE>   Years of painstaking legislative hearings and lawsuits led to the
1994 victory and a habitat restoration plan four years later. But the
Water Board decision "is a political one that can be changed," the
committee has warned, vowing to "make sure that does not happen."</TE>
<TE>   It is not alone. The area--including the entire highway widening
project area--is part of the Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area,
and that means the Forest Service oversees all development to ensure
that it preserves scenic beauty.</TE>
<TE>   The Mono Lake Tufa State Reserve abuts the highway, covering the
entire underwater portion of the 60-square-mile lake, as well as a
shoreline ring--including wetlands--that would be disturbed by the
highway project.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that park land "may literally be buried under the project
by fill slope material using the construction methods discussed," a
California State Parks district ecologist, Ken Anderson, wrote to
Caltrans late last year. "Constructing a wall to limit the amount of
fill slope will leave the reserve with a huge unnatural feature
visible from almost everywhere around the lake."</TE>
<TE>   The Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board has weighed in
with wetlands concerns. Altogether, the various agencies and
activists were so worried about the lack of project specifics--and
the seemingly damaging scope of the rough blueprint--that the Mono
Lake Committee decided earlier this summer to take its concerns to
the top.</TE>
<TE>   The group sent a letter to Morales, outlining the issues and
challenging him to apply his department's own nascent "Context
Sensitive Solutions" policy to the lake project. Within five weeks,
the 2,000 letters had been fired off to Davis, urging him to step in
too.</TE>
<TE>   Making a Difference</TE>
<TE>   The public complaints made a difference. By mid-July, Morales and
Baggett--who heads the agency that ordered the lake's
restoration--were on a plane to Lee Vining, a highly unusual move
meant to "to make sure we're not running amok out here and lend some
support," Shultz said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the Mono Lake Committee has called off its letter-writing
"action alert," deeming it a success, McQuilkin said. "We've been
able to get everyone talking about the project at the level of detail
where we can ... consider different options," he said. "It feels like
a partnership."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials will walk the site Friday with McQuilkin's
group and the other agencies to devise a milder option that would be
included in the draft environmental impact report--delayed in part by
the outcry--Shultz said.</TE>
<TE>   "We may put forward an alternative that doesn't 100% meet our need
and purpose but may substantially meet it," he said. "It may say,
'OK, a lot of people don't want this. It could be ugly; we don't know
if we can mitigate it, so let's not even try.' "</TE>

<HD>Master of Capitol Arts Retires as Union Chief</HD>
<DH>Politics: Prison guards' Don Novey, viewed as the most
effective advocate in Sacramento, may run for state Senate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Don Novey, whose sharp instincts and analytical mind helped him build
the state prison guards union into perhaps the most powerful player
in California politics, is stepping down after 22 years as the
union's boss.</LD>
<LD>   Novey, 55, is a barrel-chested former guard at Folsom State Prison
and widely viewed as the most feared and influential advocate in
Sacramento. As he enters retirement, his initial plan is to go
fishing with his aging father and spend more time with his four
grandchildren. But he said he might soon return to the Capitol--as a
politician.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd like to run for a Senate seat," Novey said in an interview.
"I'm thinking about it."</LD>
<TE>   In the 1998 election, Novey's union, the California Correctional
Peace Officers Assn., was the state's No. 1 donor to legislative
races, setting a record by spending $1.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the union's support for Gov. Gray Davis that
year--including $2.1 million in donations--may have sealed the
election. Since Davis took office, the union has given him $662,000
more, and critics suggest that money helped the guards win a generous
new labor contract that included a 37% raise.</TE>
<TE>   Even Novey's retirement, marked at a Thursday ceremony at which
his successor also was sworn in, signaled his unusual power. The
event was attended by Senate leader John Burton and several other
lawmakers and took place on the Senate floor.</TE>
<TE>   "He's smart, tough and farsighted," said Burton (D-San Francisco),
an old ally and frequent beneficiary of the union's support. "And he
loves the game of politics."</TE>
<TE>   Novey is being succeeded by his second-in-command, Mike Jimenez.
In an interview, Jimenez said he initially credited Novey's
achievements to "dumb luck," but came to admire his predecessor's
work ethic, political savvy and strategic mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Don taught us all the recipe for success," said Jimenez, 41, the
union's vice president for eight years. "I'm going to stick with it."</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez added that Novey, while officially retired, would stay on
as an advisor to the 29,000-member union on legislative and political
affairs. "He'll be around. He's too valuable for us to let him go,"
Jimenez said.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a correctional officer, Novey took over the union in
1980, when its members numbered just 6,000. At the time, guards were
the dregs of the law enforcement world, comparatively underpaid and
undertrained. They also were poorly organized and, as Novey once put
it, viewed by most Californians as a "bunch of knuckle-draggers."</TE>
<TE>   Bit by bit, Novey hoisted the profession's reputation, appeal and
compensation. He successfully pushed for longer academy training,
psychological screening for applicants and the right of officers to
carry concealed weapons off the job.</TE>
<TE>   Salaries climbed too, and, at $54,888 for a senior officer, they
are today far in excess of those in Texas, the state with the
second-largest prison system.</TE>
<TE>   Novey's final coup as president was overseeing eight months of
negotiations that produced the lucrative new labor contract approved
by the guards in December and then signed by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers have criticized the pact as a sweetheart deal that
should never have been approved--particularly in a year when
California faces a $24-billion budget deficit. It will raise pay by
as much as 37% by 2006, allowing veteran guards to make as much as
$73,428 a year. The deal permits officers to retire at age 50 with as
much as 90% of their salary.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the contract's new provisions will cost Californians
$518 million a year, an independent audit found. One month after the
agreement was signed, the union contributed $251,000 to the
governor's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Novey's political muscle has improved salaries and benefits to
the point where guards are going to earn more than an associate
professor after six years on the job," said state Sen. Richard
Polanco (D-Los Angeles), a longtime adversary. "The Legislature and
the administration weren't bold enough to stand up to him."</TE>
<TE>   Novey said his single most important mission has been to improve
life for the men and women who, he says, "walk the toughest beat in
the state." But his effectiveness did not stop there. While other
groups, such as the California Teachers Assn., have more members and
bigger bank accounts, few can match his influence.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Novey helped fuel California's $5-billion, 20-year
prison building boom, and he was a key force behind the three-strikes
law. He also nurtured the state's victims' rights movement, which has
been a potent force in shaping criminal justice policy, from
sentencing to parole.</TE>
<TE>   Because lawmakers so covet the union's endorsement, Novey's sway
over the fate of legislation is also legendary. If he opposes a bill,
odds are it's dead. By contrast, politicians who draw Novey's ire can
expect the union to spend heavily against them in their next race.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent target was Assemblyman Phil Wyman (R-Tehachapi),
who supported private prisons that the union opposes because its
members can't work in them. In the primary election this year, Wyman
lost to challenger Sharon Runner after the union spent more than
$200,000 on her behalf. In another instance in the late 1990s, the
union spent record amounts on a local race to unseat a district
attorney who attempted to prosecute prison guards in a brutality
case.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Novey's success stems in part from his
unpredictability. One day, he's backing liberal lesbians from San
Francisco; the next, he's supporting GOP good old boys from the
California heartland.</TE>
<TE>   Some were shocked, for example, when the union endorsed Democrat
Davis over his 1998 election foe, former Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren--a
fellow Republican who shares Novey's passion for victims' rights and
capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Novey said he went with Davis because Lungren refused to take the
pay cut that former Gov. Pete Wilson had asked of all state employees
during the recession in the early 1990s. But critics saw a link to
Lungren's investigation of abusive guards at Corcoran State Prison.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, it was a telling blow for Lungren, and ultimately
added to Novey's reputation as a political savant.</TE>
<TE>   "He has mastered the art of picking winners and also creating
winners," said Rob Stutzman, a Republican consultant. "In California
politics during the 1990s, few people have left as indelible a mark
as Don Novey."</TE>
<TE>   The union boss chuckles over such high praise, and said the
accomplishments he values most are his work with victims groups and
missing children foundations. He hopes to step up his work on those
pet projects as he contemplates his next career move.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it is, he'll pursue it at a gentler pace. Diabetes has
slowed him and diminished his eyesight, and he wants more quality
time with his family.</TE>
<TE>   As for that possible venture into politics, Novey said he might
run for Sen. Rico Oller's seat if Oller, a Republican from San
Andreas, makes a bid for Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "It might be fun," Novey said with his customary air of mystery.
"You never know."</TE>

<LD>Harry Walker, 85, the founder of the speakers agency that counts
former Presidents Clinton and Ford among its clients, died July 27 in
Burlington, Mass., of complications from surgery.</LD>
<LD>   The Harry Walker Agency represents other former heads of state,
including Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto and Israel's Ehud Barak, along
with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. The agency also
represents celebrities such as Beverly Sills and television
journalist Bill Moyers.</LD>
<LD>   Walker was born in Poland, and his family immigrated to the U.S.
when he was 4. They settled in Manhattan, and he graduated from
Yeshiva University. He later earned a master's degree in social work
from the Jewish Institute of Religion.</LD>
<TE>   Walker founded his speakers agency in 1946. Two years later, he
signed the American-Christian Palestine Committee, a Zionist group,
whose speakers were widely popular at a time when Israel was becoming

<DL></DL>
<LD>Roberto Cobo, the Mexican actor who played the role of a desperate
young street tough in Spanish director Luis Bunuel's 1950 classic
"Los Olvidados" (The Forgotten Ones), died Friday.. He was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Cobo, nicknamed "Calambres" (Cramps), died in a Mexico City
hospital of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The actor is best remembered as "El Jaibo," the character he
portrayed in Bunuel's film about impoverished street kids in Mexico
City. A sociopath and the product of the tough, loveless atmosphere
of his Third World slum, El Jaibo murders those who get in his way
and, finally shot by police, whispers his last line: "I am alone."</LD>
<TE>   The handsome, lanky Cobo played El Jaibo to perfection.</TE>
<TE>   He later went on to play another singular role as Manuela, a
transvestite father, in Arturo Ripstein's 1977 film "El Lugar Sin
Limites" (A Place Without Limits).</TE>
<TE>   The actor, whose real name was Roberto Garcia Romero, was a native
of Mexico City. He won numerous awards for his acting.</TE>

<HD>Ballot Measure Tricky Issue for Slow-Growth Crusaders in
Ventura</HD>
<DH>Homes: Proposal asks voters to OK project. But group that
advocates role of the public says it would set bad precedent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years their argument has been that in bucolic Ventura County,
high-stakes decisions about growth must be left up to voters.</LD>
<LD>   Now, founders of Save Open Space and Agriculture Resources have
found themselves in a tricky position: They are fighting to kill a
measure that asks voters to approve a 1,390-home development in
Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   Critics say the move reveals the true motivation behind SOAR: to
halt any and all development.</LD>
<TE>   But slow-growth leaders maintain there is more at stake in this
measure than the luxury hillside homes it would clear the way to
build.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is the initiative unconstitutional, they argue, it would
set a dangerous precedent for the future of growth-control laws in
Ventura County--which planning experts have called "ground zero" for
California's growing anti-sprawl movement.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of initiative is not what voters had in mind when they
passed SOAR," said Ventura County Supervisor Steve Bennett, one of
the architects of the county's historic growth-control measures.
"This is someone turning SOAR on its head."</TE>
<TE>   Later this month, a judge will decide the measure's fate. Lawyers
for both sides are scheduled to make their case at an Aug. 30 hearing
in Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Forbes, a Los Angeles land-use attorney who represents the
longtime property owners of the hillside land, said the Open 80
Master Plan Act is constitutional and should not be shot down before
voters get a chance to speak.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to scare people with arguments about process," she
said. "They don't want you to look at the substance of the plan
because they're afraid you might like it."</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, Ventura County has become one of the most
growth-restrictive local jurisdictions in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The movement was begun in the early 1990s by two former Ventura
council members, Bennett and Oxnard attorney Richard Francis, who
wrote the first SOAR growth-control initiative for the seaside city.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, residents in every major local city have
overwhelmingly approved SOAR measures intended to restrict urban
expansion into agricultural land or open space. The new laws require
voter approval of projects outside a city's designated urban
boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Some cities also have passed ordinances blocking housing on
ridgelines, and two new growth-tightening measures are on the
November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall in Ventura, residents passed Measure P, putting
restrictions on extending city services such as water and sewer into
the unincorporated hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   In all of these efforts, the message to policymakers has been
clear: Let voters decide.</TE>
<TE>   There have been only a few tests of this philosophy in Ventura
County, including a church expansion in Ventura and a nursing home in
Ojai. Neither stirred much controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The Open 80 plan is a hot-button proposal in part because it is
unlike anything voters have had to face in the post-SOAR world, said
Bill Fulton, a Ventura-based regional planning expert.</TE>
<TE>   First, it is the only initiative so far to propose residential
development--1,390 housing units plus 40,000 square feet of
commercial space.</TE>
<TE>   Second, it takes a much different approach than the one SOAR
leaders say they originally envisioned, which was for voters to
"ratify" developments already approved by the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, hillside landowners have crafted a detailed
plan--stopping short of intricate tract maps and home designs--that
they will take to the voters for approval before they take it to the
City Council. The result is what some call ballot-box development.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say they took that route for two main reasons: The
requirement for voter approval of hillside development as set out by
Measure P, and the fact that existing city codes would make it
difficult to apply for permits to build the kind of master-planned
community they are proposing.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes no sense to waste the city's time and resources if the
voters don't want this," said Margaret Merryman, a west Ventura
resident and citizen spokeswoman for the project. "We're offering
3,000 acres of open space for the opportunity to build 1,390 homes,
and we're asking people, 'Are you OK with this?' "</TE>
<TE>   But those explanations do not satisfy SOAR leaders or the Citizens
for Hillside Preservation, the main activist group fighting the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say that while the idea of trading the right to build
hillside homes for a big chunk of open space may be simple, the
agreement presented to the voters is not.</TE>
<TE>   It is 165 pages long and includes a wordy legal document known as
a development agreement. Such contracts are common for housing
projects in California but typically arise out of negotiations
between the city and the developer, not by initiative.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the hillside landowners--three family corporations
representing 320 people--wrote the development agreement themselves
without input from the city.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes, however, said the contract was modeled after negotiated
agreements from other cities. It also took into account conversations
with city staff that have occurred over the last six years, she said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Forbes, the agreement was a way the landowners could
make two things binding: that they would have to give the city the
promised open space, and that city leaders could not change the rules
on them--such as arbitrarily downzoning their land--midway through
the process.</TE>
<TE>   City Council members will have the ability to vote on the details
of the plan, which automatically triggers an environmental impact
report, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many say they fear the agreement will "lock in" approvals
upfront, before crucial environmental and traffic studies are
complete.</TE>
<TE>   "They have filled this thing with technical outs that make it look
like the city has discretion, but in practical terms, I believe that
is wrong," said Fulton, the planning expert, who has taken a position
against Open 80. "Amy Forbes is such a great lawyer that they can
wiggle out of a lot of the criticism."</TE>
<TE>   The Open 80 plan got on the ballot after volunteers and paid
consultants gathered more than 11,400 valid signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides agree that such a voter-led development initiative is
unprecedented in the state.</TE>
<TE>   But, Bennett and Francis said, it's also illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, SOAR filed a lawsuit in an attempt to get the
initiative removed from the ballot before the election. The
California Constitution prohibits initiatives from naming any
specific company that would benefit from the measure, the suit
contends.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes said the argument is a red herring. A recent case in
Albany, Calif., set a precedent for development agreements to be
placed on the ballot in areas where voters have passed laws asking to
be responsible for land-use decisions, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The citizens of Ventura clearly have said they have the power to
decide," she said. "It's the essence of home rule."</TE>
<TE>   Open 80 supporters also call the lawsuit hypocritical.</TE>
<TE>   "Here they fought very hard to make sure voters decided whether a
project could go through," said Robert Ryan, a Ventura physician.
"And now they say this is too complex, and that the voters aren't
smart enough to figure this out?"</TE>
<TE>   Francis and Bennett dispute that their position is a
contradiction.</TE>
<TE>   "We do think the public should vote, but after they are given the
facts," Francis said. "It should not be based just on a sugarcoated,
self-dealing measure."</TE>
<TE>   The strict laws may have intended to enable people to simply vote
"No" on projects, but what they really did was give citizens the
opportunity to vote "Yes" or "No," said Ventura Mayor Ray Di Guilio.</TE>
<TE>   "Voters are now realizing how complicated and complex it is to
make land-use decisions," Di Guilio said. "They better get used to
it, because this is what they asked for."</TE>

<LD>While thousands of people marveled at the professional surfers
gliding over Huntington Beach's waves and others cheered at the
extreme bikers and skaters performing aerial tricks on specially
built ramps, Brandon Lawson was feeling like a surfer without getting
his feet wet.</LD>
<LD>   Lawson, 24, clutched a joystick and stared at a digital screen
where he simulated the art of surfing, immersed in a virtual-reality
video game. His purple Michael Jordan basketball jersey stood out in
Philips' Digital Beach, a trench of high technology that is a feature
of this year's Philips' U.S. Open of surfing.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt like I was really surfing," Lawson said soon after he was
wiped out by a virtual wave.</LD>
<TE>   Outside, on the real beach, the ambience was even more surreal.
Surfing's top competitors walked Huntington Beach's coastal streets
with their hair still wet, toting boards in each hand. Scantily clad
extreme-sports fans showed off a collage of tattoos and body
piercings.</TE>
<TE>   Folk singers, accompanied by guitars, competed with strident punk
music on loudspeakers. And masses huddled around the sponsors'
booths, scuffling over free sunglasses and skateboards.</TE>
<TE>   The organizers of the annual surfing event strove to be different.
This year's motto: "When action sports, music and technology
collide," said Mike Kingsbury, public relations director for Philips
Fusion.</TE>
<TE>   "We combined the history and tradition of surfing with the
popularity of extreme sports," said James Leitz, vice president of
IMG X Sports.</TE>
<TE>   Collisions during the event were more than symbolic. About 11:30
a.m., a woman lost control of her car and knocked over a concrete
post designed to keep vehicles away from the pier's pedestrian
entrance. No one was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   A collision in the skating bowl during the Best Trick competition
took 36-year-old skating star Mike Smith out of the contest with a
knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   The skating event featured riders in various categories and
ranging from in age from 24 to 45. It included skaters from countries
such as Cuba and Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   While the skaters tried to match each other's tricks, extreme BMX
cyclists sprang from ramps behind the skating competition. The air
became part of the stage and the surfing moves were emulated on
wheels.</TE>
<TE>   "Surfing is the grandfather of many of the extreme sports," Leitz
said about the similarities in the various open-air events.</TE>

<HD>Douglas' Dream Took Wing in Santa Monica</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Monica's Museum of Flying, which depicted aviation history for
almost three decades, is history itself now, dispossessed by rising
insurance costs. As it circles in search of a new landing site in a
rural area, it leaves behind its roots in a seaside community that
once welcomed an ambitious designer who transformed air travel.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the heritage of the museum and the adjacent airport--which
is staying put, to many of its neighbors' dismay--is intertwined with
aviation pioneer Donald Wills Douglas Sr. More than 80 years ago,
Douglas Aircraft Co. flew its first plane, ushering Santa Monica into
aviation history.</LD>
<LD>   Sprawled over more than 200 acres of now-expensive land a short
distance from the beach, Santa Monica Airport began as a dirt strip
in a barley field in 1919. Howard Hughes and film director Hal Roach
used to tie down there. Douglas' dreams took flight there when it
became the home of his aircraft plant.</LD>
<TE>   DC model planes, military and civilian--up to and including the
DC-10--were built there. The first around-the-world flight, which was
orchestrated by Douglas, took off from and landed there.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas, a New York native and graduate of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, moved to Los Angeles in 1920 to take
advantage of its grand flying weather.</TE>
<TE>   He had already designed a history-making World War I bomber for
Glenn L. Martin Co. that had sunk two German warships. Now, he was
determined to make it on his own in the airplane business.</TE>
<TE>   With him in a bucket-seat jalopy for the cross-country drive were
his wife, two children (the couple eventually had five), a dog and
$600 in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas began designing planes in the back room of a barbershop on
Pico Boulevard. But times were tough. To help feed his family, he dug
up his yard and planted potatoes--which promptly rotted. He resorted
to washing cars.</TE>
<TE>   Then a wealthy sportsman, David R. Davis, heard that Douglas was
looking for investors. He put up $40,000, hoping to ride to fame on
Douglas' wings. It was to be a short-lived partnership.</TE>
<TE>   In 1921, Douglas built his company's first plane, a two-seat, wood
and fabric biplane he called the Cloudster. On Feb. 21, it became the
first aircraft to get off the ground carrying weight exceeding its
own.</TE>
<TE>   That helped attract the Navy's attention. It agreed to pay Douglas
$120,000 for three Cloudsters that would be adapted to shoot
torpedoes and to land on water. But he needed money to build them.
And that's when Davis backed out, apparently because he was tapped
out--less than a year after signing on.</TE>
<TE>   That left Douglas' fledgling enterprise a bit up in the air.</TE>
<TE>   As he struggled mightily to fulfill the Navy contract, Times
Publisher Harry Chandler fashioned a parachute. The captain of a
newspaper that boosted "air-minded" projects helped raise $15,000 to
keep Douglas in business.</TE>
<TE>   In 1922, Douglas moved to an abandoned movie studio in Santa
Monica and began making military planes. At nearby Clover Field, a
15-acre landing site named for World War I pilot Lt. Greayer "Grubby"
Clover, Douglas tested his aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   On March 17, 1924, he made history when eight Army airmen took off
from Clover Field in four single-engine, open-cockpit Douglas World
Cruisers. They intended to circle the globe, but stopped by Seattle
so they could designate it as their takeoff point. That would trim
time off their journey--two weeks, as it turned out.</TE>
<TE>   The aviators flew into sandstorms, driving rain, Arctic winds and,
once, a mountain. Two planes crashed, but no one died. The two
remaining aircraft returned to Clover Field 28,945 miles and 175 days
later, having gone round the world and sealed Douglas Aircraft's
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven years later, Douglas built the civilian DC (for Douglas
Commercial) models, revolutionizing air travel as an undertaking for
ordinary passengers, not just the daring. The aircraft made its
maiden voyage from Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas held on through the Depression, expanding Clover Field.
But a world war loomed, sending him and his production line into
overdrive.</TE>
<TE>   By now fiercely competitive with Los Angeles' seven other major
aircraft manufacturers, Douglas was forced to suppress his
competitive spirit and play nicely with his competitors. The
companies, which included Northrop and Lockheed, were required to
combine operations temporarily to meet wartime demand.</TE>
<TE>   He hated it, but went along for the duration.</TE>
<TE>   "When the dictators are finally bombed off this Earth, we shall
become rugged individualists and rivals again," Douglas wrote in a
1942 magazine article.</TE>
<TE>   In 1940, as a morale booster for his employees, who were already
cranking out warplanes and working round-the-clock shifts, he opened
the Aero Theater on Montana Avenue in Santa Monica. He kept it
operating at all hours so his workers and the public could enjoy
brand new Abbott and Costello comedies and other Hollywood releases.</TE>
<TE>   With World War II raging in Europe, Douglas realized well before
Pearl Harbor that his plant was a sitting duck for an air attack. He
didn't wait for the government to protect him; he took the controls.
Douglas asked his chief engineer and test pilot, Frank Collbohm, and
a renowned architect, H. Roy Kelley, to devise a way to camouflage
the plant. (Later, Collbohm would found Rand Corp. and Kelley would
design its headquarters.)</TE>
<TE>   Together with Warner Bros. studio set designers, they made the
plant and airstrip disappear--at least from the air.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 5 million square feet of chicken wire, stretched across 400
tall poles, canopied the terminal, hangars, assorted buildings and
parking lots. Atop the mesh stood lightweight wood-frame houses with
attached garages, fences, clotheslines, even "trees" made of twisted
wire and chicken feathers spray-painted to look like leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Tanker trucks spewed green paint on the runway to simulate a field
of grass. Streets and sidewalks were painted on the covering to blend
into the adjacent Sunset Park neighborhood of modest homes that
housed Douglas employees.</TE>
<TE>   The tallest hangar was made to look like a gently sloping hillside
neighborhood. Designers even matched up the painted streets with real
ones.</TE>
<TE>   When they were done, the area was so well disguised that pilots
had a hard time finding Clover Field. Some of them landed at nearby
airstrips instead, protesting that someone had moved the field.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas adapted. When planes were due, he stationed men at each
end of the runway to wave red flags like matadors. Eventually, the
signalmen were replaced with white markers painted on the hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   (The facade was such a success that Warner Bros. replicated it,
fearing that the studio looked like an aircraft plant from the air.)</TE>
<TE>   The simulated neighborhood became such a part of the community
that, when Douglas Aircraft shed its disguise in July 1945, it was as
if a landmark had been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1960s, Douglas had evolved into a sprawling aerospace
company employing 30,000 workers. But the neighborhood was
diversifying--and losing its unquestioning acceptance of the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the company found Santa Monica resistant to its expansion
plans. Neighbors protested about the noise, and the folks on the L.A.
side of the airport hated the fact that airliners preparing for test
flights blew oil and chunks of carbon onto their cars.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, consolidation of the industry would begin. The
company merged with a rival to become McDonnell-Douglas Corp. in 1967
and moved to Long Beach in 1976. The 5,000-foot runway at what was by
then known as Santa Monica Airport was too short for the firm's
growing jet production.</TE>
<TE>   (Two decades later, McDonnell-Douglas would be absorbed by yet
another rival, Boeing Co.)</TE>
<TE>   When the corporation left town, Douglas' son, Donald Wills Douglas
Jr., set up the Donald Douglas Museum and Library to commemorate his
father's legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Sr. died in 1981. Nine years later, the nonprofit Museum
of Flying, founded by golf course and real estate developer David
Price, superseded the old museum as part of a $20-million airport
overhaul.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibits included vintage planes and an immense photo of when the
airport and plant operated under cover of camouflage.</TE>
<TE>   All that remains of Douglas' operation today are Santa Monica
Airport, now used for general aviation; the Aero, struggling to
survive an invasion of multiplexes; and Clover Park, which sits atop
Douglas' original plant site.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Politics Needs 'Major Correction,' Gore Says</HD>
<DH>Democrats: Former vice president tells centrist critics
that fighting for the people is party's role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In response to Democratic critics of his emphasis on economic
populism, Al Gore denied he is anti-business and said that fighting
for the people rather than for the powerful is the party's mission.</LD>
<LD>   That theme is central to the political debate heading into the
midterm congressional elections this fall, the former vice president
said Saturday, just as it was the key to domestic issues during his
failed presidential campaign against George W. Bush in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   "A major correction is needed in the course of our nation," Gore
said, urging voters to send new lawmakers to Washington this fall.
Democrats hold a 50-49 edge over Republicans in the Senate, with one
independent, and need to pick up seven seats to take control of the
435-member House.</LD>
<TE>   Gore said that, as a result of President Bush's economic policies,
"what has been put at risk is nothing less than the future of
democratic capitalism."</TE>
<TE>   "Standing up for the people, not the powerful, was the right
choice in 2000," he said in a statement defending his policies. "In
fact, it is the ground of the Democratic Party's being--our meaning
and our mission."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of a centrist Democratic group, the Democratic Leadership
Council, meeting last week at a policy conference in New York,
complained about Gore's economic populism theme from the 2000
campaign. They said they did not believe a theme of "the people
versus the powerful" was a winning formula for party candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "The suggestion from some in our party that we should no longer
speak that truth, especially at a time like this, strikes me as bad
politics and wrong in principle," Gore said in the statement, his
first personal response to the council.</TE>
<TE>   He said a theme of his 2000 campaign had been that a Bush
administration would favor special interests at the public's expense.</TE>
<TE>   "Some considered this warning 'anti-business.' It was nothing of
the sort," Gore said. It is often "smaller companies that play by the
rules" that suffer along with the people, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The DLC, which has become a kind of clearinghouse for the party's
presidential candidates over the last decade, complained that Gore's
stance would alienate swing voters.</TE>
<TE>   The group generally tries to blend a pro-business flavor and
moderate social views with core Democratic values--a strategy it
hopes will win over conservative Democrats, independents and moderate
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Gore, who has not said whether he will seek the party's
presidential nomination in 2004, did not attend the DLC meeting. Five
presidential hopefuls showed up, outlining their ideas to centrist
Democrats.</TE>

<HD>Conductor Faulted in Passenger's Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A commuter train conductor was wrong to continue making scheduled
stops for 20 minutes while a passenger was having a heart attack,
Amtrak said in a report late Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The passenger, James R. Allen, 61, of Wellesley, Mass., later died
at a Boston hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The report said conductor James Peros did not "quickly and
accurately assess the situation and notify the dispatcher as soon as
possible."</LD>
<TE>   Amtrak's crews run the commuter trains for the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority. Spokesman Joe Pesaturo said the MBTA just
received the Amtrak report late Saturday and had not reviewed it.</TE>
<TE>   Peros, who has been suspended, will be formally disciplined, the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   MBTA will invite an independent consultant to review safety
policies, general manager Mike Mulhern said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In statements given to Amtrak and the MBTA, Peros said he received
an initial report from assistant conductor Walter LaCombe before 9
a.m. that a passenger had a weak pulse and trouble breathing.</TE>
<TE>   But based on that information and the heat Tuesday, Peros said he
did not think the situation was "critical" and requested an ambulance
at Back Bay instead of two nearer stations.</TE>
<TE>   When he went to check on the situation himself just two minutes
later, he saw CPR being administered and he realized the condition
was "more serious." He then used a phone to confirm paramedics would
be waiting at Back Bay.</TE>
<TE>   However, the train stopped at West Newton and Newtonville, asking
passengers to hurry aboard before making the 11-minute run to Back
Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Peros defended his decision to proceed to the Back Bay station
because medical personnel weren't as accessible at the Newton stops.
LaCombe refused a request to be interviewed by the MBTA on advice of
his union, Pesaturo said.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak Chief Operating Officer E.S. Bagley Jr. said operating
procedures do not specify when and where a train must stop during a
medical emergency, and the discretion is left to the conductor.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bagley said a notice had been issued to Amtrak's New
England Division ordering trains to stop at the closest station.</TE>

<HD>7 Accused of Murder in Chicago Beatings</HD>
<DH>Crime: One suspect has confessed to helping kill two men
after a traffic accident, authorities say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Authorities charged seven people Saturday with killing two men who
were stomped and beaten with bricks and stones when a mob attacked
them after a traffic accident.</LD>
<LD>   Each person was charged with two counts of first-degree murder,
two counts of felony murder based on mob action and two counts of mob
action in the deaths of Jack Moore, 62, and Anthony Stuckey, 49, said
Jerry Lawrence, a spokesman for the Cook County state's attorney's
office.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Tucker, 20, and Antonio Fort, 16, were ordered held without
bond Saturday. The other suspects--Henry Lawrence, 47; his brother,
Roosevelt Lawrence, 43; Lamont Motes, 20; James Ousley, 31; and Ricky
Lawson, 43--were scheduled to have bond hearings today, the spokesman
said.</LD>
<TE>   Saturday's hearing came four days after a mob pulled two men from
a van that had hurdled a curb and struck a group of people sitting on
the stoop of a home in the Oakland neighborhood of the city. Three
women were hospitalized after the crash.</TE>
<TE>   As the injured lay on the ground, the mob beat Moore, who was
driving, and Stuckey to death with their hands and feet, and bricks
and stones, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Tucker broke the driver's-side window with his hands, punched
Moore, pulled him out of the van and stomped on him, said Assistant
State's Atty. Megan Goldish.</TE>
<TE>   She said Tucker gave a videotaped confession and had cuts on his
arms that likely were caused by the broken window.</TE>
<TE>   Fort, who was charged as an adult, allegedly helped pull Stuckey
out of the van and kicked and beat him with a slab of concrete.</TE>
<TE>   Fort's lawyer, Lawrence Wolf Levin, said Fort plans to plead not
guilty to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   "If he was there, he was there to help [the injured]," Levin said
of his client's involvement. Fort was to begin his sophomore year in
high school this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Autopsies revealed that Stuckey, an unemployed day laborer and
factory worker, and Moore died of multiple injuries and blunt trauma,
according to the Cook County medical examiner's office. Toxicology
tests showed that Moore was legally drunk at the time of the crash,
but police said that had no bearing on their investigation.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, one of the three women hit by the van remained in the
hospital. Shani Lawrence, 26, was in critical condition at Mount
Sinai Hospital, according to a hospital spokeswoman.</TE>

<DL>FAYETTEVILLE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Police arrested a 15-year-old in the shooting death of a Ft. Bragg
soldier whose wife also has been charged in the slaying.</LD>
<LD>   The name of the teenager, charged Friday with first-degree murder
and conspiracy to commit murder, has not been released.</LD>
<LD>   Army Maj. David Shannon, 40, a Special Operations soldier, was
shot July 23 as he slept. His wife, Joan, 35, was arrested Tuesday
and charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.</LD>
<TE>   Police said Shannon was killed for insurance and military
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The slaying was the fifth domestic-related killing linked to the
base since June 11. Four Ft. Bragg wives have been killed, allegedly
by their husbands, and officials say they are looking at the cases to
determine if the stress of military life was a contributing factor.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 25-foot baby humpback whale washed ashore on Long Island after it
apparently had been hit by a ship.</LD>
<LD>   The whale surfaced Friday night at Robert Moses State Park on Fire
Island. After an autopsy, marine biologists ruled that the whale had
suffered bruising and internal hemorrhaging.</LD>
<LD>   Julika Wocial, a marine biologist at the Riverhead Foundation for
Marine Research and Preservation, said the humpback's death was
likely unrelated to the dozens of whale carcasses that surfaced on
Massachusetts shores earlier this week.</LD>

themselves on beaches.</TE>

<HD>Elder Bush Treated for Skin Malady</HD>
<DH>Health: The condition is caused by overexposure to the sun
and can lead to cancer if left untreated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine</DL>
<LD>Former President Bush completed treatment last week for sun-induced
keratoses on his face, a condition that can lead to a common form of
skin cancer if left untreated, it was disclosed Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The explanation came as the 78-year-old former chief executive,
his face marked by red splotches, joined his son, the current
president, on the golf course at 6 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   Asked about his condition, the elder Bush told reporters:
"Fine--almost finished," as he raised his hands, gesturing to his
face.</LD>
<TE>   The former president was treated by physicians from the Mayo
Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz. The clinic released a statement Saturday
saying that Bush had been treated with the topical salve
5-fluorouracil. The medication was applied to areas of damage in the
top layers of skin on both sides of his face.</TE>
<TE>   Keratoses are changes in the size, shape or organization of skin
cells. They are a fairly common result of overexposure to the sun.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not skin cancers; they can be effectively treated and
eliminated," said the Mayo statement, which was distributed by a
White House official at the golf course.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush is spending a long weekend at his parents' seaside
compound. He returns to Washington on Monday and then heads to his
Texas ranch.</TE>
<TE>   According to the clinic statement, the treatment was applied over
a two-week period ending July 28. The redness is caused by the
inflammation of the keratoses after they are destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Bush is currently in the healing phase, and the prognosis for
total recovery is excellent," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   At Cape Arundel Golf Club, father and son briefly chatted with
reporters before starting their round.</TE>
<TE>   The former president made light of his age as he teed up at the
forward set of tees--to shorten the distance to the hole.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm playing the ladies' [tees]--78 years old," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   After hitting a solid drive, the younger Bush turned to onlookers
and quipped: "Let's hear it--make the old boy feel better!"</TE>
<TE>   Late Saturday afternoon, the president traveled by boat from
Walker's Point, site of the family compound, to nearby Prouts Neck to
speak at a fund-raiser for Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and the state
Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   At the helm of the Fidelity II speedboat was the elder Bush.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said the fund-raiser was
expected to raise $200,000 for Maine Republicans and $100,000 for
Collins' reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Collins is a first-term moderate known for her streak of
independence. She is favored to defeat her Democratic challenger,
Chellie Pingree, the former majority leader of the state Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Although clad in a suit and tie, Bush seemed unusually relaxed as
he disembarked from his father's cigarette boat.</TE>
<TE>   "This probably is the first political event that I've traveled to
by boat. And I want to thank the boat's captain, No. 41," he said, a
reference to his father being the nation's 41st president.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks, Bush lavishly praised Collins' record even as he
playfully acknowledged her independence.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't do everything she says. She doesn't do everything I say.
But she's an ally and I'm proud to call her a friend," Bush said,
chuckling.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the president leaned over to Collins and asked her
if she had voted with him to repeal the inheritance tax. After she
answered in the affirmative, Bush went on to call for a permanent
repeal of the "death tax."</TE>
<TE>   With his father also on the stage, Bush reiterated his
determination to seek a regime change in Iraq, although he did not
mention President Saddam Hussein by name.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a lot of tools at my disposal," Bush said. "This country
will defend freedom no matter what the cost."</TE>

<HD>Images of 9/11--Some Comfort Too</HD>
<DH>Anniversary: Blanket TV coverage will also confront mental
health issues a year after terrorist attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks is looming as an
overwhelming media event, with many TV and radio stations promising
blanket coverage over several days, much of it uninterrupted by
commercials.</LD>
<LD>   Now, one New York TV outlet, itself planning to be a big
contributor to the airwave saturation, is gearing up to help viewers
cope with the mental health issues that it expects will result.</LD>
<LD>   NY1 News, an all-news channel owned by Time Warner Cable, said
that during the week preceding the anniversary, it will bring back a
popular, daily call-in show for New Yorkers to talk through their
fears with mental health counselors.</LD>
<TE>   The one-hour program first aired a few days after the attacks and
continued through mid-December, when viewers finally seemed to have
exhausted their need for on-air counseling and the volume of calls
tapered off. In its first weeks, producers fielded dozens of highly
charged calls each day from viewers who had lost friends and family,
were afraid to leave their homes or didn't know what to tell their
children.</TE>
<TE>   The anniversary will likely "open a lot of old wounds," said Steve
Paulus, senior vice president and general manager of NY1. City
agencies are planning to make counselors available for their
personnel, he said, "so we figured, if it's going to be provided for
the uniformed services, why not for the millions of people out there
who lived through it? There certainly are enough people who don't
have anyone to talk to."</TE>
<TE>   NY1, which will also have a psychologist on hand the day of the
anniversary to take calls during breaks in coverage of memorial
events, isn't the only network anticipating mental health issues. NBC
News has hired a child psychiatrist as an on-air consultant and
behind-the-scenes advisor for its own coverage, and will air public
service announcements to help parents guide their children through
the day.</TE>
<TE>   The state of New Yorkers' mental health in the aftermath of the
attacks has already been a topic of much discussion, speculation and
research. One study, released in May, suggested that more than
400,000 city residents had experienced post-traumatic stress disorder
since Sept. 11. The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that
there are 90,000 people living south of 110th Street in New York City
who are suffering from depression as a result of the attacks. Other
studies have documented increased alcohol and drug use.</TE>
<TE>   "The original event had a massive effect on the mental health of
New Yorkers, and with that background, you would expect that the
anniversary of the event would regenerate some of the feelings that
people experienced," said Ezra Susser, chairman of the Epidemiology
Department at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health
and a department head at the New York State Psychiatric Institute.</TE>
<TE>   He said one school of thought argues that it is harmful for the
media to keep repeating the frightening pictures and dwelling on the
topic, but Susser disagrees: "This is something that New Yorkers
experienced in common and it generated quite a bit of social
cohesion." Sharing the event through public forums and in the media,
he said, "is helpful for dealing with it, and it could be a very
helpful thing to focus on the anniversary."</TE>
<TE>   The coverage is inevitable, he said, and so it's key is shaping
the media event. Neglected during the aftermath of the attacks were
New York's Muslims, Arab and non-Arab, who "didn't feel a part of
what everyone else felt, the common experience," Susser said, adding
that "one really useful thing would be to somehow incorporate them
into this."</TE>
<TE>   Revisiting the traumatic events will be hard to escape on
television and radio, as well as in newspapers, many of which are
preparing special coverage. CNN is getting a jump on the
commemoration process with a two-part documentary, "America
Remembers," on Aug. 17 and 24. In the days leading up to the
anniversary, CBS plans to rebroadcast its film about firefighters who
responded to the World Trade Center site, PBS plans a week of related
documentaries and Discovery Communications' five cable networks will
air 14 hours dubbed "Faces of 9/11." On the actual anniversary, many
networks plan nonstop coverage. That night, NBC will air a "Concert
for America."</TE>
<TE>   NY1 News, which still programs one hour per night related to the
aftermath of the attacks, itself will contribute heavily to the media
coverage. The channel plans weekly town hall meetings through August,
vignettes on how city life has changed, profiles of victims, a
minute-by-minute look at what happened, and, on Sept. 13, a 2
1/2-hour reading of every victim's name, conducted by celebrities
including Cynthia Nixon of HBO's "Sex and the City" and Ben Vereen.</TE>
<TE>   With so much coverage on so many channels, "It's going to be tough
to watch," said Paulus, but he added that his channel has no choice:
"We're a New York station, and this is such a big story.... We have
to cover it; we're going to cover it."</TE>

<HD>It's Smooth Trucking for Other Ones</HD>
<DH>Music: Problems are few as thousands of Grateful Dead fans
flock to see band's survivors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST TROY, Wis.</DL>
<LD>It's been seven years since Jerry Garcia's guitar fell silent, but
the kaleidoscope of wriggling humanity he kept on the road for more
than 30 years is very much alive.</LD>
<LD>   The reanimated Grateful Dead, who have taken to calling themselves
the Other Ones, stuttered to a start Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Apparent equipment problems waylaid the opening notes--a spacey
flourish that would have sparkled were it not for the speakers
clipping out at least a dozen times.</LD>
<TE>   The sounds righted, the Other Ones lugged out the heavy thunk of
"He's Gone," but before the apropos was fully realized or a note was
sung, slipped into "The Other Ones," as if to stamp their own
identity into the present.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd was ready and, with the band fully in a groove, the
giant green bowl of Alpine Valley Music Theatre was flush with
flailing limbs and thousand-watt smiles.</TE>
<TE>   After weeks of tense negotiations between Grateful Dead
Productions, Clear Channel Entertainment and local authorities over
concerns the concert would be overrun by people who didn't have
tickets, 35,000 Deadheads steadily descended into East Troy with
little problem.</TE>
<TE>   Before the show, drummer and original member Mickey Hart was
relaxed and predicting big things based on weeks of rehearsals.</TE>
<TE>   "Only a few people have heard it, and from what they've told us,
it's back," Hart said. "The creature lives. If we play that way
tonight, you'll hear the Grateful Dead. We won't call it the Grateful
Dead, but it will be better than where we left off, I'll tell you
that."</TE>
<TE>   Standing in for Garcia on guitar was Jimmy Herring, a veteran of
tours with the Allman Brothers and Dead-related side projects.</TE>
<TE>   "He's great," Hart said. "He's a sweetheart. He doesn't play
anything like Jerry, and best of all, I don't think he's even a
Deadhead."</TE>
<TE>   A similar incarnation of the Dead's remnants has played since
Garcia died in August 1995, but never with this much anticipation.
Hart and Herring joined original members Bill Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh
and Bob Weir for the show.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff David Graves called it a "very successful concert event,"
noting only 11 arrests and 60 citations, mainly for drugs. Extra
deputies were assigned to work, but Graves said some were sent home
early.</TE>
<TE>   The band sold out all 35,000 seats for the shows Saturday and
today at about $60 a ticket.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM AGNESS, ORE.</KH>
<HD>Constant Fire Watch Tries the Patience of Laid-Back Hamlet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AGNESS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Just when they think the forest fire is quieting, and talk resumes
about pulling salmon and steelhead trout from the Rogue River, the
smoke roils over the ridgeline once again. Women confide their fears.
Men bristle with anger and defiance.</LD>
<LD>   Like a low-grade fever that's irritating but not debilitating,
this fire wears on daily life in southwestern Oregon.</LD>
<LD>   It has been burning for three weeks through the crowded conifers,
myrtles and oaks of Siskiyou National Forest.</LD>
<TE>   And for just as long, it has been threatening the 150 residents of
this river valley hamlet, accessible from the east by only a steep,
serpentine, one-lane road that clutches the mountainside without
guardrails, flanked by towering firs and patches of ferns, wild
daisies and Queen Anne's lace.</TE>
<TE>   By Saturday, the Florence blaze had burned through 190,000 acres
of trees and untold plots of Oregon's vaunted marijuana crop, and
continued to keep 17,000 residents south of here on evacuation alert.
It is one of 11 big fires burning nearly half a million acres in
Oregon, shrouding big cities and small towns in acrid, stagnant
smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Given some measure of fortune, Agness is mostly upwind of this
forest fire, and the sky is usually brilliant blue, so they call it
the lurking monster. Stoked by afternoon heat and wind, the fire
rears its head from behind the ridgelines, obliterating the afternoon
sun with plumes of smoke that turn from white to muddy orange.</TE>
<TE>   The fire dragon creeps to within four or five miles of here,
retreats and returns. Its incessant threat is even wearing thin the
patience of this particularly laid-back town.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like living in Florida and getting a hurricane watch
every day for two weeks," complained Leo Wright, a Las Vegas
businessman who maintains a second home here so he can run his
powerful jet boat up the river to relax. "Well, bring on the
hurricane and get it over with."</TE>
<TE>   Corlyss McCullough tries to ignore the smoke as she prepares her
family's legendary fried chicken for the river rafters and jet boat
tourists who, despite the fires, continue to come and stop at the
family's bucolic, 80-year-old Lucas Lodge for hearty suppers.</TE>
<TE>   "We just pray to the Lord to give us the winds to push the fire
back," she said. But Friday night the smoke seemed closer than ever,
eclipsing the southern sky. "Pray," she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Postmaster Sandy Stallard has been tracking the fire's progress
through word of mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "It was coming down Lawson Creek, and someone told me that Game
Lake burned," Stallard said. "I'm not sure if it's reached Nancy
Creek or the Indigo. It missed the Briggs Ranch, but it burned the
old Connor homestead. And it's up on the entire ridge above
Fishhook."</TE>
<TE>   She has bundled up family treasures, including an heirloom quilt,
for quick escape.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the eclectic Agness Store, where the sign on the wooden
screen door perpetually promises "Free beer tomorrow," owner Gayle
Soule gamely greets tourists, who are only slightly fewer in number
this summer. They buy Rogue River apple butter and blackberry jam,
locally crafted shell jewelry and vintage children's pedal cars,
which Soule's husband, Tom, has painstakingly restored. But Soule's
mind is elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a hard time sleeping," she said. "When I get up in the
middle of the night to go to the bathroom, I go out on the porch deck
and look for the glow." She's packed her grandmother's ceramic
rolling pin and the carnival glass fruit bowl with the cranberry
edging.</TE>
<TE>   The men who gather at the metal picnic table in front of the store
don't betray such anxieties. "Floods and fires, not a damn thing you
can do about them," said Butch Wood, sipping his afternoon Hamm's. A
flood in '64 took out two bridges that weren't replaced, and
residents now have to drive eight miles farther to leave town.</TE>
<TE>   "If the fire blows this way, it does. But it won't," he said.
"Here, have a beer, and don't worry about it."</TE>
<TE>   At his nearby home, Bill Scherbarth, chief of the 12-person Agness
Volunteer Fire Department, is monitoring news on his scanner and
isn't sure what to make of the fire's progress as it slowly creeps
down the Illinois Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "It could make a run and create its own wind, and could come into
Agness tomorrow," he said. "Or in two weeks. Or not at all."</TE>
<TE>   There's ample debate here about how long it would take for the
fire to reach Agness. Given the right wind, five hours, one fellow
says. Two hours, says another. It's not coming, a third says.</TE>
<TE>   A simple firefighting plan is in place, if the flames do reach the
junction of the Rogue and Illinois rivers where Agness is situated.
The strategy means no disrespect to the 1,700 professional
firefighters already attacking the blaze on other fronts.</TE>
<TE>   "All the men will stay to fight it, and some of the women too, but
some of the other women will have to get out with the children," said
former Curry County Sheriff Allen H. Boice.</TE>
<TE>   Tonya Wood offers another plan of attack, proud of her father's
expertise atop a Caterpillar bulldozer. "Put my dad in a D-8 with a
case of beer on both sides of him, and he'll put that fire out," she
boasted.</TE>
<TE>   There's more than a little frustration here that the fire wasn't
quickly extinguished after it was spotted July 15 by John Rachor, a
local who, everyone is quick to point out, owns 11 Burger King
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   When he had spotted another small fire two days earlier while
flying his Husky bush plane to Medford, U.S. Forest Service crews
quickly extinguished it. But when he reported this fire, apparently
sparked by lightning, there was no immediate response, and the
one-acre fire, with four smoldering trees, grew quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't be too critical of them," Rachor said of the Forest
Service. "They had fires burning everywhere. And even now, some
people aren't too bothered by the fire. But others are nervous
wrecks."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the fire's growth, a second fire command post was
installed Saturday at the nearby coastal town of Gold Beach to focus
on the blaze's northern movement toward Agness.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, the new incident commander, Kim Martin, drove
through Agness to familiarize himself with the lay of the land and to
see what evacuation routes were available for residents, just in
case. There is just one.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire at this end is starting to become a higher priority. I
hope I can get 30 [20-person] crews, more 'dozers and some aircraft
up here," he said. "I know people are upset there wasn't more fire
suppression efforts earlier. But there are just so many fires burning
in the West.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to fight this fire aggressively. But what people need
to realize is, this fire will burn until snow flies."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it will snow in October, residents hope.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the women serve fried chicken and sort the mail
and sell Rogue River jams, and men sip their beer and talk about
fishing and dare the fire dragon to head this way so they can finally
slay it.</TE>

<HD>Once Again, Florida Ballot Spurs Drumbeat of Complaints</HD>
<DH>Vote: Instructions for primary could cause problems like
those in 2000, Democrats say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The ballot for the high-profile Democratic gubernatorial primary has
confusing instructions that could cause the same problems that marred
the 2000 presidential election, Democrats said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The ballot instructs voters to "vote for one pair," meaning a
combined entry of governor and lieutenant governor, though none of
the candidates has chosen a running mate.</LD>
<LD>   Voters who took the instruction literally would "overvote" and
nullify their choice, Democrats said.</LD>
<TE>   Under the names of gubernatorial candidates Daryl Jones, Bill
McBride and Janet Reno, the ballot reads "not yet designated" in
place of a lieutenant governor candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Party chairman Bob Poe said Saturday he would ask Secretary of
State Jim Smith on Monday to change the ballot language. Smith's
office was closed Saturday and phone messages were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   Poe also said the party is considering court action.</TE>
<TE>   "This confusing language poses a serious threat to the integrity
of the primary ballot," Poe said.</TE>
<TE>   Poe said the language needs to be changed quickly because ballots
are being mailed to overseas voters now for the Sept. 10 primary.
Gov. Jeb Bush is unopposed for the Republican nomination.</TE>
<TE>   New voting systems are designed to catch overvotes and allow
voters to correct them. Computerized "touch screen" voting machines
in 15 counties do not let people vote twice. And new scanners in 52
counties with paper ballots are aimed at detecting overvotes before
voters leave the polls.</TE>
<TE>   The problem would mostly fall on thousands of absentee voters in
all 67 counties because there is no mechanism to catch an absentee
overvote, Democrats said.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Jane Bradshaw, assistant director of the office's elections
division, said she wrote the new wording to replace language that was
even more confusing.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very confident that we will be addressing and fine-tuning
the rules after the election," Bradshaw said. The instructions "vote
for group" and "vote for one group" are blamed for prompting
thousands of Floridians to vote for more than one presidential ticket
in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   About 113,000 Floridians nullified their ballots with overvotes in
the race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. More than 59,000 of
those voters lived in counties where ballots told them to vote for a
"group." Bush won by 537 votes.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole world is watching us. A mistake like this is a total
embarrassment for the state," said Nicole Harburger, campaign
spokeswoman for Reno. "This ballot virtually guarantees that people
in Florida will be overvoting and that ballots will be lost in the
process."</TE>

<HD>Tainted Petition Muddles Race for D.C. Mayor</HD>
<DH>Ethics: Anthony Williams was knocked off the Sept. 10
primary ballot for submitting allegedly fake signatures. He may be a
write-in candidate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>He was supposed to be the antidote to political embarrassment. After
four terms of Mayor Marion Barry--convicted of drug possession after
a government sting, seen about town with women other than his
wife--Anthony Williams was supposed to restore the nation's capital
to civilized governance.</LD>
<LD>   The bow tie connoted old-fashioned values. The degrees from
Harvard and Yale universities spoke to impeccable intelligence, as
did the wry wit. The background as an auditor helped too, calming
fears about the city's financial woes. Even the slight aloofness of
this Los Angeles native conveyed a man of purpose, uncomfortable with
chitchat, too dignified for the street-smart politics of his
swashbuckling predecessor.</LD>
<LD>   But now Washington is stunned by news that the mayor, so
politically golden that no credible candidate was challenging his
reelection, failed to gather a mere 2,000 signatures to qualify for
the ballot. The simplest, most mind-numbing task in politics has
become a cause of heart-wrenching angst. When the U.S. Court of
Appeals takes up the case Tuesday, the pain could turn permanent.</LD>
<TE>   "Marion Barry never would have made a mistake like this," said
E.J. Dionne Jr., political columnist for the Washington Post. "This
petition foul-up is not some minor infraction. If you respect the art
of politics, it's absolutely enraging."</TE>
<TE>   The petition imbroglio began when a 23-year-old third-year
Georgetown University law student went down to the voter registrar's
office to check petitions for fraud.</TE>
<TE>   In his bid for reelection, Williams had submitted 10,102
signatures. "I wasn't even going to look, because he had so many,"
said Shaun Snyder, originally from Newport Beach. "As soon as I
flipped through them, I knew immediately."</TE>
<TE>   There were pages and pages of petitions in the same handwriting.
Names were repeated. Signatures of notables such as Kofi Annan and
Kelsey Grammer were forged. Joining forces with a political activist
group called D.C. Watch, Snyder challenged the mayor's petitions.</TE>
<TE>   During an intense and emotional three-day public hearing, the
District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics overruled the
registrar, who counted 2,235 legitimate signatures. The board,
appointed by Williams, found that the fraudulent signatures--many
collected by a top aide who invoked his 5th Amendment right to not
testify and could be indicted for fraud--were so numerous they
tainted the entire filing.</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy Brizill, the executive director of D.C. Watch, put her
head down on her arms in front of her, in utter shock. The incumbent
mayor--with $1.4 million in the bank and facing opposition from
candidates like Faith Dane, a 79-year-old exotic ballet dancer--would
not appear on the Sept. 10 Democratic primary ballot. And in
Washington, a city that went 85% for Al Gore in 2000, that is the
only ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Florida without the chads," satirist Mark Russell, who has
observed Washington politics for 50 years, said in a conversation
from his summer home in New York. "This incredible fiasco brings to
reality the old joke about the bumbling candidate who ran unopposed
and lost."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who turned 51 last Sunday, has apologized so often that
his press secretary, Tony Bullock, calls him "the man of 1,000 mea
culpas."</TE>
<TE>   But to the astonishment of the political establishment, he is
fighting the election board's decision in court, arguing before the
appeals court that the decision does not rest on "clear evidence."
With hearings set for Tuesday, Williams is doing something he once
found distasteful: taking to the hustings and vowing a write-in
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a lifelong Democrat," he said. "I will not abandon the
Democratic Party." (Nor, apparently, does he want to abandon his
campaign war chest, which officials said he could not keep if he ran
as an independent.)</TE>
<TE>   Concerned about ballot complications, Williams' staffers are
imprinting No. 2 pencils and self-inking stamps with the mayor's name
to distribute to voters at the polls. They have reached out to
political consultants, such as Parke Skelton, who helped Long Beach
Mayor Beverly O'Neill mount a successful write-in campaign in June.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome, the petition embarrassment has shaken
Washington's political establishment--the middle-class black and
white professionals who define the city's core and the business
interests that fuel its economic health. And it has only fed
suspicions about the powerful in the city's poor black wards, where
Barry, a civil rights activist who once took a bullet during a
stand-off at City Hall, is something of a cult hero.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is largely credited with helping rescue the city from
fiscal ruin in the late 1990s, when he served as chief financial
officer for the control board brought in to manage the district's
finances. Now his reputation as a man of probity is tarnished.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course there should have been somebody minding the store,"
said Carol Schwartz, one of the city's few Republican officeholders,
who often runs for mayor. "And I do hold the candidate responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Plotkin, a local radio commentator who specializes in D.C.
politics, sees the incident as evidence of Williams' disdain for
politics. "He was elected four years ago as the ultimate
un-politician. We have a low bar in Washington politics. All we want
from the mayor is someone who won't embarrass us and who makes sure
the Department of Mo- tor Vehicles works."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' political tin ear has gotten him into trouble before.
This spring he was one of the hosts for a Capitol Hill fund-raiser
for Rep. Constance A. Morella, a suburban Maryland Republican whose
election could determine whether the House of Representatives stays
in GOP hands or turns Democratic. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton
(D-D.C.), a nonvoting representative in Congress, was said to be
furious, although she and Williams later patched things up over lunch
in the House members' dining room.</TE>
<TE>   Plotkin's greatest criticism of Williams is that he has not used
his tremendous standing with the elites in town to push for a higher
cause, such as the drive to make the District of Columbia the 51st
state. Under current law, Congress can overturn any laws enacted by
the City Council and mayor, and residents do not have a voting
representative or senator, prompting bumper sticker frames that say,
"No taxation without representation."</TE>
<TE>   Lanny J. Davis, who specializes in crisis management--something he
did for President Clinton during the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal--is a
fan of the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "He's done a great job for the district, but he missed the
essential rule of crisis management: Tell it all, tell it early and
tell it yourself," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Like most in Washington, Davis thinks Williams will somehow win.
But he wonders, "How long are we going to let him ride on not being
Marion Barry?"</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Fierce storms that rattled the Northeast killed three men who were
hit by lightning, and left thousands of residents without power.</LD>
<LD>   Nathan Maddox, 25, was killed Friday night as he watched the storm
from a downtown rooftop with friends, police said. In Pennsylvania,
Matthew Tresca, 16, of Clifton, N.J., was killed by lightning at a
Boy Scout camp.</LD>
<LD>   And in Maryland, Michael Paul Palmer, 55, was struck by lightning
Saturday at his home and was killed. A 17-year-old boy was injured by
lightning while at a swimming pool.</LD>
<TE>   Lightning hit the ground an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 times across
the New York metropolitan area in a three-hour span Friday during a
storm that deposited more than an inch of rain, said National Weather
Service meteorologist Jeffrey Tongue.</TE>
<TE>   In Putnam County, N.Y., about 10,000 homes were without
electricity after the storms, said Robert Bondi, a Putnam County
official. He declared a limited state of emergency as utility crews
across the state were called in to help repair downed utility lines
and snapped poles.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,000 homes in the county remained without power late
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   There were 31,000 outages in New York City's five boroughs and
Westchester County, with all but about 9,000 restored Saturday, said
Consolidated Edison spokeswoman D. Joy Faber.</TE>
<TE>   In New Jersey, automatic safety sensors shut down a cable car ride
as the storm approached Six Flags Great Adventure at Jackson,
stranding 23 people, park spokeswoman Kristin Kocher said.</TE>
<TE>   It took about an hour to get all the riders down from the cars,
Kocher said. No one was injured.</TE>

<HD>Catholic Church in Dilemma Over Where to Put Ousted Priests</HD>
<DH>Policy: After deciding that clergy guilty of sexual abuse
would be removed from active ministry, bishops were faced with few
workable alternatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When America's Roman Catholic bishops decided that any priest guilty
of molesting a youth should be ousted from active ministry, they left
a major loose end hanging: what to do with those priests.</LD>
<LD>   During the June meeting in Dallas at which they approved a
toughened clerical sexual abuse policy, bishops remarked that erring
priests could be assigned to live in special "houses of confinement,"
or monasteries.</LD>
<LD>   However, those ideas are problematic. The few "houses" in
existence can take only a handful of men, and religious orders say
monasteries simply are off-limits.</LD>
<TE>   The Rev. J. Cletus Kiley, the abuse specialist for the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops, said there have only been "some
preliminary conversations" about assignments for such priests, but
"it is a challenge, and it's one of the things we have to face."</TE>
<TE>   One problem, he says, is that nobody knows how many men might need
special housing.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 of the roughly 46,000 U.S. priests have resigned or been
taken off duty this year because of abuse allegations, including at
least 50 since the June meeting. What happens next to those men now
falls into three categories:</TE>
<TE>   * An abuser can request "dismissal from the clerical state,"
commonly known as defrocking.</TE>
<TE>   Each case requires Vatican approval, but under the current
circumstances bishops expect this will occur readily. Since this is
the simplest solution, bishops hope many molesters will leave
voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   * The bishop can forcibly dismiss an abuser from the priesthood
without his consent.</TE>
<TE>   That leads to cumbersome procedures involving U.S. and Vatican
church tribunals. Since 1989, the U.S. bishops have wanted Vatican
permission for a streamlined administrative process and may revisit
this topic at their Nov. 11 meeting in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   * A molester can be barred from functioning as a priest without
dismissal from the priesthood. The June policy says this will apply
especially "for reasons of advanced age or infirmity," and such men
will lead "a life of prayer and penance."</TE>
<TE>   With either voluntary or involuntary dismissal, a man "no longer
has any priestly obligations to the church or the church toward him,"
says Msgr. Francis Maniscalco, spokesman for the bishops' conference.
But those in the final category still are priests, and thus are the
church's responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Religious orders have insisted that monasteries cannot serve as
dumping grounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Canice Connors of Rensselaer, N.Y., president of the
Conference of Major Superiors of Men, said that a man needs a
vocation and the right personal characteristics to live under the
regimen of a monastic community, and "a vocation doesn't come from
being an offender."</TE>
<TE>   "Monasteries simply won't be open to such things," he said. "It
would wreck the monastic structure."</TE>
<TE>   The other option is special long-term residences, sometimes called
"houses of confinement," for those, as Kiley puts it, who are
"removed permanently from ministry" and yet want "in some way to live
their life out as priests."</TE>
<TE>   Connors says five religious orders cooperated in the 1990s on a
small, experimental residence for their own members near Washington,
but shut it down after three years.</TE>
<TE>   The house didn't work and had low morale because of insufficient
planning, he said. In particular, "we have to do a lot more research
on activities for the men to feel useful." The major superiors will
discuss the need for such institutions during their annual meeting in
Philadelphia this week.</TE>
<TE>   Kiley said the Chicago Archdiocese operates a retreat house where
it put recently removed priests, and other dioceses might make use of
retreats or priests' retirement homes. He said there have been
initial talks about providing a special wing for permanent residents
at St. Luke's Institute, a Maryland therapy center.</TE>
<TE>   The best-known example of long-term housing, Kiley said, is
provided by the Servants of the Paraclete at Jemez Springs, N.M., an
order founded in 1947 to help priests in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Jay R. Feierman, a psychiatrist who started working at Jemez
Springs in 1976, said the facility "used to be called an
ecclesiastical jail, because it was the end of the road for priests
who had serious problems," usually alcoholism.</TE>
<TE>   Feierman introduced professional therapy, and gradually the
facility treated an increasing number of priestly molesters. But
bishops and religious superiors returned many patients to active
ministry against the advice of therapists, Feierman said. After a
spate of lawsuits, the Paracletes ended the program in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The facility then was converted to Villa Louis Martin, a long-term
residence for troubled priests. The Paracletes operate a similar
house at the Vianney Renewal Center in Dittmer, Mo., but last year
shut a third house in Cherry Valley, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Raymond Gunzel, a Paraclete priest, said that some
residents cannot leave unaccompanied.</TE>
<TE>   The daily regimen consists of worship and private prayer, group
meetings, upkeep of the house and grounds, reading, writing and
exercise.</TE>
<TE>   The two Paraclete houses are small, providing for 10 men or so,
which hardly begins to meet potential demand.</TE>
<TE>   Kiley noted that it's difficult to plan new institutions until the
bishops and religious orders find out how many men will want to
remain priests even though they're unable to function in the role.
And no one knows how long it will take the church to determine those
numbers.</TE>

<HD>Stalled Superfund Cleanups Anger Activists, Spur Fears
About Future</HD>
<DH>Environment: EPA says commitment to funding hasn't wavered,
but the money is running out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EDISON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>For 11 years, Robert Spiegel spent his nights creating elaborate
wedding cakes and his days trying to force the government to clean up
the arsenic, lead, dioxin and other lethal chemicals that saturate a
six-acre lot nestled between suburban homes and a factory-sized
bakery.</LD>
<LD>   His commitment seemed about to pay off when, after years of
studies and planning, federal Environmental Protection Agency
officials announced a $28.5-million cleanup of the site where
Chemical Insecticide Corp. had once manufactured a range of deadly
chemicals, including the components of Agent Orange. Work was to
begin this fall.</LD>
<LD>   But a few months ago, local EPA officials told Spiegel not to
expect the cleanup to begin soon. Then, last month, a report by the
EPA inspector general named the Chemical Insecticide site as one of
33 priority Superfund sites in 19 states that had not received
funding requested by EPA branch offices.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like getting the wind knocked out of you," said an outraged
Spiegel, as he stood amid about 60 barrels of hazardous materials
left at the site.</TE>
<TE>   With a number of sites around the country denied financing and the
Superfund close to running out of money, there is growing concern at
the grass-roots level that years of hard work to clean toxic waste
sites may end in futility.</TE>
<TE>   Congress and President Carter created the Superfund program in
1980 in response to the public outcry over the toxic disaster at Love
Canal in New York. The trust fund, which was financed through taxes
on polluting industries and court awards for hazardous substance
releases, provided money for cleanups on sites where the polluters
could not be charged. By the program's 20th anniversary, 757 sites
had been cleaned nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   But the fund is expected to be all but depleted by the end of next
year, leaving it to scarce general tax revenue to pay for any further
cleanups.</TE>
<TE>   Spiegel and other supporters of the program attribute the idleness
at Chemical Insecticide and other toxic sites to the Bush
administration's failure to renew the tax, which expired in 1995.
President Clinton proposed renewing it, but the GOP-controlled
Congress balked.</TE>
<TE>   "The perception that things are slowing down is arising from the
fact that so much hysteria has been created ... in the community,"
said EPA spokesman Joe Martyak.</TE>
<TE>   Marianne L. Horinko, the assistant EPA administrator in charge of
the Superfund program, called Spiegel's concerns "unfounded." "I'm
not slowing anything down," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the inspector general's report, about half of the 33
Superfund sites have either been allocated some federal cleanup funds
or determined to be not ready for cleanup. But at least 16 sites are
still listed as ready, but without the funding.</TE>
<TE>   These stalled cleanups and the failure to reinstate the tax have
contributed to growing grass-roots skepticism about the federal
government's commitment to the program, according to local
environmentalists and members of Congress with sites in their
districts.</TE>
<TE>   "With the trust fund declining, there is a lot more uncertainty
about future funding," said Karen N. Probst, the author of a
congressionally ordered report released last year on the Superfund's
future. "And with the Bush administration's environmental track
record, when the Bush administration says they're committed to
Superfund, people aren't that sure."</TE>
<TE>   If the government fails to clean up the Superfund sites
quickly--after communities have slogged through the extensive
application, testing and planning stages--the program's reputation
could be undermined, said Probst, a senior fellow at Resources for
the Future, a Washington-based think tank that focuses on the
economics of environmental problems.</TE>
<TE>   "It took them 12 years to get to where they are," Probst said,
referring to the activists in Edison, N.J. "The whole program's
credibility will be hurt if there are projects in the pipeline for
that long and then EPA has to stop cleanups."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First Visit in 1990</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, the back gate was wide open at the
long-abandoned Chemical Insecticide Corp. The only indication of the
potential danger inside was a sign face down in the dirt that read:
"Danger no trespassing; hazardous substances present."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s and 1960s a variety of pesticides and herbicides,
including DDT and the components of Agent Orange, were produced here
and shipped as far as Vietnam. Excess chemicals were dumped into
several large pits. Through the years, the chemicals migrated across
the parking lot of a large bakery and into a brook that flows through
an apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, when the plant was still functioning, six cows died after
drinking water in that brook. The plant owner was fined $200,
according to a newspaper article.</TE>
<TE>   The plant buildings were razed long ago. Nature appears to have
reclaimed the site with shrubs, trees and weeds.</TE>
<TE>   Spiegel first visited the site in 1990 with a friend who was
familiar with it. At the time, the property was not fenced despite
the potential danger to people who lived in the neighborhood and the
children who attended a nearby school.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbits with lime-green undercoats, apparently from exposure to
the pesticide Dinoseb in the soil and water on the lot, hopped around
the lot, Spiegel said. The EPA banned Dinoseb in 1986 because of the
high risk of birth defects and other health problems.</TE>
<TE>   Spiegel was appalled. What he saw that day inspired him and some
friends to create the Edison Wetlands Assn., an environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody had to do something about it," he said. "That somebody
was me. I had no idea it would become my life's crusade."</TE>
<TE>   He gathered every document he could about the plant's history. One
day when he was copying documents at the regional EPA office, the
clerk assigned to help him felt ill and left him alone. He copied
almost the entire contents of two file drawers. The next time he
visited the office, most of those documents had been removed from
public files.</TE>
<TE>   "They made some of the most dangerous stuff known to mankind
here," Spiegel said.</TE>
<TE>   After much haranguing from Spiegel and his group, the EPA tested a
nearby stream and found arsenic and other dangerous chemicals. As an
interim effort in the mid-1990s to stop the spread of the toxic
chemicals, the EPA dug up the stream bed and installed an impermeable
cap, like a huge swimming pool cover, over the part of the site where
hazardous chemicals were most concentrated.</TE>
<TE>   This has prevented the migration of most harmful chemicals. But
these were supposed to be only temporary fixes until specialists
could conduct tests to assess the extent of the contamination and
plot the appropriate solution.</TE>
<TE>   Spiegel and the residents were delighted two years ago when the
EPA proposed removing 106,000 cubic yards, enough to cover a football
field with five stories of dirt, from the site. Detailed diagrams of
the excavation were completed and the community approved plans to
move the dirt on trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Now the EPA has put that plan back on the shelf.</TE>
<TE>   Edison Mayor George Spadorois is considering filing suit against
the EPA for breaking its contract with the community.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happened here is outrageous," he said. "They've done a
terrible injustice to Edison."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the cap has already passed its projected life span and
is starting to break up in some places.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer it takes to clean it up, the more possibility that
health impacts could get worse," said Rep. Frank Pallone Jr.
(D-N.J.), who represents Edison in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Pallone said residents are right to be concerned about whether the
government will make good on its promise to clean up hazardous sites
at a time when the trust fund, which held $3.8 billion as recently as
1996, is down to its last $28 million.</TE>
<TE>   "People have no confidence; they know there is going to be no
money in the trust fund next year," Pallone said. "The notion that
we're going to rely on general revenue funds I think is nonsense.
There's too much competition for that money."</TE>
<TE>   Horinko called the concerns about the tax a "red herring."</TE>
<TE>   "As long as they send me the dollars that I can use to get cleanup
done, that's what matters to me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Funding has remained flat for the program in recent years at about
$1.2 billion a year, with money from general tax revenue
supplementing the fund.</TE>
<TE>   Horinko and other EPA officials explained the stalled cleanups at
Edison and the 15 other sites as routine consequences of budgeting
priorities. They stressed that the government remains committed to
the cleanups.</TE>
<TE>   But neither Horinko nor EPA officials in the region could specify
when they would take place.</TE>
<TE>   One clue might come from Probst's report to Congress, which
projected that Superfund cleanups would require an extra $200 million
to $400 million per year in 2002 through 2004 on top of its
$1.2-billion base level.</TE>
<TE>   Spiegel, for one, is not letting the setback deter him.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first year that Spiegel's group had the money to pay
him a salary, and he has quit his baking job to press for cleanups of
New Jersey's many toxic waste dumps full time. He is lobbying
Congress to renew the Superfund tax, and he is trying to form
alliances with like-minded groups around the country.</TE>
<TE>   He recently sent each member of the Senate Environment Committee a
stuffed green rabbit. A note with each bunny declared: "It's not easy
being green. Vote yes on the Superfund Tax."</TE>

<HD>Man Killed After Robbing, Shooting Up Nevada Casino</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>A robber was shot and killed by a security guard in a casino after
firing shots into a crowd of gamblers and injuring a worker.</LD>
<LD>   "He was just shooting randomly at everything that moved," Las
Vegas police spokesman Tirso Dominguez said Saturday. "It was quite a
big scene."</LD>
<LD>   Police said the gunman, who was not immediately identified, robbed
a change carousel at the Boulder Station Hotel-Casino, a popular
off-Strip casino, while brandishing a pistol about 11 p.m. Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The gunman fled out the front doors of the casino, but for some
reason turned around and went back through the casino, firing
indiscriminately, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez said police were unsure how many shots were fired.</TE>
<TE>   A casino employee tried to subdue the robber and was shot at least
once. The employee was in fair condition at University Medical
Center, a supervisor said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the gunman then knocked a casino customer to the
floor. She was treated for minor injuries at a hospital. The names of
the injured were not released.</TE>
<TE>   A casino security officer then shot the gunman, who was taken to
UMC, where he died.</TE>

<HD>Gift of 86 Works Goes to Whitney Museum</HD>
<DH>Art: New York showcase receives a record $200-million
'haul.' Artists include Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol and Jackson
Pollock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Whitney Museum of American Art received a $200-million donation
of world-class works by Jasper Johns, Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol
and 20 other acclaimed artists, believed to be the largest gift of
postwar American art to any museum.</LD>
<LD>   The donation, which particularly bolsters the Whitney's collection
of Abstract Impressionism and Pop art, accomplished in one stunning
swoop what would ordinarily take a museum decades to accumulate.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know of a parallel," museum director Maxwell Anderson
said Saturday. "I just had an e-mail from the director of the Tate
Museum [in London] congratulating us on our 'haul.' That's the
sentiment around the world."</LD>
<TE>   During a three-year effort, 86 postwar works by 23 artists were
assembled by 13 members of the Whitney's board of trustees, led by
museum Chairman Leonard A. Lauder. Ten of the trustees donated 15
works from their personal collections; Lauder contacted several
artists, including Johns, about acquiring their work.</TE>
<TE>   The other paintings, sculptures and prints were found in studios,
galleries and auction houses, then purchased as gifts for the museum.
Many represent the artists' efforts from the 1950s through the 1970s,
when they were creating some of their most acclaimed artwork.</TE>
<TE>   "These are incomparable works by the leaders of a pivotal
generation of artists," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   The donation included 32 of Johns' works, including a signature
1965 painting of double maps and 17 monotypes from his 1982 Savarin
Can series. Seven Warhol pieces, including the celebrity silk-screen
paintings "Nine Jackies" and "Double Elvis," will join the Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   Other artists represented in the donation included Robert
Rauschenberg, Mark Rothko, Cy Twombly, Ellsworth Kelly and Ed Ruscha.</TE>
<TE>   The collection will go on display at the Whitney from Oct. 24 to
Jan 26. The museum, founded in 1930, has holdings that include more
than 13,000 works by more than 2,000 artists.</TE>
<TE>   The Whitney, known for temporary exhibitions such as its biennial
survey of contemporary art, long has been in the shadows of the
Museum of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. The Museum
of Modern Art's permanent collection includes about 100,000
paintings, sculptures, prints, photographs and drawings.</TE>

<HD>Trade Center Site May Be Swapped for Airport Land</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A proposal to swap ownership of the World Trade Center property for
the land at La Guardia and John F. Kennedy International airports
deserves "serious examination," the chairman of the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "In concept, it would be consistent with the Port Authority's core
mission of transportation," said agency Chairman Jack G. Sinagra. "If
the city is serious about pursuing this idea, we would welcome such a
discussion."</LD>
<LD>   The Port Authority owns the 16-acre trade center site, and the
city owns the New York airports. A swap would cut the Port Authority
out of the rebuilding process at ground zero, eliminating its need to
maximize revenues by building and leasing a large amount of
commercial space.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg "agrees that the idea has merit and
deserves further exploration," his spokesman, Ed Skyler, said
Saturday. The trade between the city and the bistate agency was
described in several published reports.</TE>
<TE>   Six initial rebuilding plans for the World Trade Center site were
heavily criticized when they were made public last month.</TE>
<TE>   Each plan includes a sprawling memorial to victims of the Sept. 11
terrorist attack, 11 million square feet of office space and 600,000
square feet each of retail and hotel space to replace what was lost
after the twin towers collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Some family members of victims opposed commercial development on
the site. About 2,800 people were killed in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Port Authority pays $3 million annually for the land leases at
the two airports. Negotiations are underway to extend the airport
leases, which will end in 2015.</TE>
<TE>   It derives $130 million in annual revenue from the lease at the
World Trade Center site.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. George Pataki has suggested that planners look at areas
beyond the World Trade Center site for development.</TE>
<TE>   Through his appointees, the governor has considerable sway over
the two agencies guiding the proposed rebuilding effort: the Lower
Manhattan Development Corp. and the Port Authority.</TE>

<HD>A Park to Surpass Other Great Parks--Speedily</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY AGRAN</AU>
<BD>Larry Agran is mayor of Irvine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An ancient Chinese proverb reminds us that "the journey of a thousand
miles begins with a single step." Orange County voters took this
first step on March 5 by approving Measure W. The announcement on
July 23 of the Irvine's partnership with the U.S. Navy represents a
giant second step toward fulfilling the promise of creating a Great
Park at El Toro.</LD>
<LD>   On the morning after the Measure W election, the Navy announced it
would honor the will of Orange County voters by selling the property
subject to the uses permitted by Measure W. The Navy's announcement
that El Toro would be sold at public auction caught many by surprise.
This represented a change in the established policy of transferring
military bases to public ownership through public-benefit and
economic-development conveyances.</LD>
<LD>   Initially, many Orange County residents were apprehensive. We now
realize that the Navy's new policy--transforming El Toro from federal
to local control through a public auction--presented a unique
opportunity to achieve our separate and shared goals.</LD>
<TE>   Immediately following the Navy's announcement, Irvine went to work
developing a land-use plan that would meet the Navy's goal of
maximizing the value of the property for all taxpayers, and, at the
same time, fulfill our promise to create a Great Park at no cost to
Orange County taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Great Park Plan is based on the same sound
principles that have made Irvine the largest, most successful
master-planned city in America.</TE>
<TE>   In order to implement the Orange County Great Park Plan, Irvine
will annex El Toro. This will give us planning and zoning control
over the property. The Navy, as the landowner, will sell the property
at auction early in 2003 and transfer it to private owners after
Irvine has annexed the base land.</TE>
<TE>   There will be 3,400 housing units and a limited amount of retail
and commercial property developed, principally on the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   The city will require landowners to dedicate land to public uses
and pay fees to a public trust that will develop and maintain the
Great Park.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Great Park Plan, 4,000 acres, or about 84% of the El
Toro property, will be designated for parkland, open space,
recreation, and institutional uses. The land is expected to be used
for a central park with vast meadowlands and riparian corridors; a
large nature preserve with associated wildlife corridors; the
county's largest sports park; exposition areas large enough to hold
art, history, and science museums, botanical gardens and even a major
metropolitan library; a veterans' memorial and cemetery; golf
courses; a university; and more than 300 acres of permanent
agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Other great metropolitan parks have required 50 years or more to
develop. By contrast, our Great Park development strategy, harnessing
the power of private capital and the benefit of enlightened public
planning, will enable the key elements of the Great Park to be in
place within 10 years. Indeed, we expect the sports park, with at
least 50 soccer fields, baseball diamonds and other facilities for
field sports, to be built and available for public use within three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Pause for a moment and think about what this plan means for the
people of Orange County. We will have a Great Park larger than New
York's Central Park, San Francisco's Golden Gate Park and San Diego's
Balboa Park combined. Moreover, through the creation of a conservancy
or trust, the Great Park we are planning will be developed and
maintained in perpetuity with private dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The doubters, defeatists, and professional pessimists continue to
insist that the Great Park Plan will never work. These are the same
people who told you six months ago that Measure W would raise taxes
by more than $4 billion dollars and cause "a 10% countywide property
tax increase." They were wrong then, and they are wrong now. It is
time for them to join with us or get out of the way.</TE>
<TE>   The Great Park Plan meets all of the goals Irvine set forth when
we first envisioned the Great Park and drafted Measure W: There will
be no airport at El Toro. And yes, just as we promised, we will
create one of America's greatest metropolitan parks right here.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Officials Mute on State's Raw Deal</HD>

<LD>The state budget crunch is sure to have a negative effect on
municipal finances throughout California. Cities, practically without
exception, have seen the Legislature consistently erode municipal
revenue streams. Regardless of what happens in Sacramento on the
budget front, it is safe to bet that municipal finances will take a
hit.</LD>
<LD>   Cities in Orange County, like others throughout Southern
California, are being forced to cut services or raise taxes in order
to compensate for reduced revenue from Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   The state's meager contribution to Orange County cities greatly
complicates the local city council budget process.</LD>
<TE>   The vast majority of Orange County cities get less than $100 per
capita each year from state funding sources.</TE>
<TE>   In fiscal year 1998-99, for example, all but three cities--Newport
Beach, Laguna Beach, and La Habra--received less than $100 per
capita. Irvine and Seal Beach received a little more than $90 per
capita. Santa Ana, Mission Viejo, Villa Park and Huntington Beach
received roughly $83 per capita. Most of the remaining cities
received between $70 and $79 per capita. La Palma and La Brea were at
the high end at $79 each. At the low end of the range, Stanton
received $70 and Lake Forest, San Juan Capistrano and Placentia took
in $71 each.</TE>
<TE>   Four Orange County cities fared even worse at the hands of the
Legislature. Westminster, Laguna Niguel, and Fountain Valley received
about $66 per capita, while the then-newly incorporated Laguna Woods
received only $18 per capita.</TE>
<TE>   By way of comparison, the Legislature doled out about $776 per
capita to the city and county of San Francisco in fiscal 1997-98. In
the same fiscal year the County of Orange received $282 per capita
from the state. This means that even in the most fortunate Orange
County cities the combined city and county per-capita revenue from
the state only approached $400. In other words, the Legislature, in
its collective wisdom, feels Orange County citizens are entitled to
only about half the allocation of state funds that San Franciscans
enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   Given this situation, one might hope that city council members
would be pressuring the Orange County legislative delegation to win
more state money for Orange County municipalities.</TE>
<TE>   The silence from city council chambers throughout Orange County,
though, is deafening and matched only by the mute acquiescence of the
Orange County supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors and city council members love to whine about
the budget problems they wrestle with every year. Yet, for some
reason, they have been spectacularly unsuccessful in bringing
political pressure to bear on the county legislative delegation.</TE>
<TE>   A concerted effort by local city council members and the county
supervisors to repeatedly surface this issue with the voters has the
potential to prod the legislative delegation to better represent the
interests of the county's citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The institution of term limits for state legislators offers a
glimmer of hope for beleaguered Orange County residents. As state
senators and assembly members are ushered out the door in Sacramento,
other local candidates will fill their ranks.</TE>
<TE>   City council members and members of the county Board of
Supervisors frequently see themselves as prime prospects to move up
the political food chain and enjoy the perks and powers of
legislative office in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   It would be good for the citizens of Orange County if these newly
elected legislators remembered their roots in local government. And
their former city council colleagues and county supervisors should do
a much better job of reinforcing this message than they have to date.</TE>
<TE>   One would also expect that in exchange for their support of these
newly minted legislators, Orange County citizens would enjoy the
benefit of fervent defense of their interests at the state level.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult, however, for individual citizens to keep track of
the complex machinations of the Legislature. More than 20,000 bills
are introduced each legislative session. All too often this proposed
legislation is mind-numbingly complex and carefully crafted to elude
citizen comprehension.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors and city council members, on the other
hand, are supported by highly paid professional staff. These
professionals are certainly capable of keeping city councils and the
Board of Supervisors well informed about legislative actions (or lack
thereof).</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the League of California Cities maintains a
professional legislative staff in Sacramento, as does the County
Supervisors Assn. of California. These professional staff members can
be helpful in providing information to local government officials.</TE>
<TE>   In sum, there is no good reason why council members in Orange
County cities and the county Board of Supervisors should not be
well-informed about the appalling fact that Orange County citizens
are getting a raw deal from the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   By tapping into the readily available resources, county
supervisors and city council members in Orange County could do a much
better job of pushing the legislative delegation to do what is best
for the citizens of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: Orange County voters should hold supervisors and
council members running for the Legislature accountable for their
inaction.</TE>

<HD>St. George Usurps Union Jack as Flag of Choice in a More
English Britain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>For a son of Pakistani immigrants growing up here in the 1970s, the
Union Jack inspired fear.</LD>
<LD>   Aggy Akhtar would cross the street to avoid the kind of people who
wore their love of the British flag as an aggressive accessory. It
was the favored symbol of violent, racist thugs.</LD>
<LD>   "If you saw someone with short hair and the usual uniform--which
was a Union Jack vest--you'd cross the road," Akhtar said.</LD>
<TE>   The East London businessman is now 36 and a millionaire whose
latest venture is selling millions of flags to mark soccer's World
Cup, Wimbledon, the summer cricket season and the approaching
Commonwealth Games.</TE>
<TE>   And the flag that people are buying is not the Union Jack,
familiar to most Americans as the red-white-and-blue symbol of
Britain. Instead, buyers prefer the banner of England, the St.
George's flag, a simple red cross on a white background.</TE>
<TE>   Akhtar has sold 2.8 million flags since October, 90% of them St.
George's crosses. Many were sales associated with the World Cup--in
which the St. George's flag is officially identified with England's
soccer team because there is no unified British team. But even after
England's defeat, the flag kept on flying.</TE>
<TE>   The rise of the flag of St. George has prompted introspection,
going beyond the question of whether the flag was a fad, popular
because it was painted on many a soccer fan's face, to the bigger
question of what being English is all about.</TE>
<TE>   To optimists, it's a sign that the English are slowly resolving an
identity crisis that sprang up a few years ago when Scotland and
Wales got their own parliaments, which raised troubling questions
such as, "Am I more British? Or am I more English?"</TE>
<TE>   To pessimists, it's a harbinger of the breakup of Britain. Most
analysts, however, don't see English nationalism as likely to shatter
the union. They see it the other way around: English nationalism is a
response to the patriotism, strong national identity and steps toward
self-rule in Scotland and Wales.</TE>
<TE>   Others see the red-and-white flag as a kind of antidote to racism,
an embrace of English multiculturalism. Although soccer hooligans and
racist thugs have grabbed the St. George's cross as a symbol too, the
World Cup saw it flying from pubs, houses, vans and taxis. That it
has continued flying since is a sign that the populace has taken it
back.</TE>
<TE>   "If the flag was something hijacked by the far right, now it's
definitely in the hands of the right people," Akhtar said.</TE>
<TE>   Columnists have attributed the flag-waving--even, surprisingly, by
standard-bearers of the left--as a sign of resurgent patriotism in a
land usually reticent about expressions of nationalist sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "The English have come slowly, shyly to their national identity,"
conservative columnist Tony Parsons wrote in the Mirror newspaper
recently. "It looks as if the English are finally allowed to start
loving themselves. The sting has been drawn out of the flag of St.
George. All the old connotations, that a red cross on a white
background meant a mind-set that was white, racist, boozy,
xenophobic, exclusive, have gone out the window."</TE>
<TE>   Parsons noted his initial surprise to see during a recent tour of
the United States that "in that part of the world, they fly their
flag, even outside the most modest homes. Once, that seemed
ridiculous to me. But not now.</TE>
<TE>   "Why shouldn't you love the country you live in? Why should you
not be proud of it? That simple red-and-white flag stands for
passion, dignity, humor, tolerance, stoicism, courage and more."</TE>
<TE>   Billy Bragg, the English singer-songwriter with a leftist agenda,
marked Queen Elizabeth II's jubilee this year with a single called
"Take Down the Union Jack," which, though stolidly ignored by
mainstream stations, made it to No. 22. (Sample lyric: "Britain isn't
cool you know, it's really not that great.... It's just an economic
union that's passed its sell-by date.")</TE>
<TE>   His new album, "England, Half English," has a St. George's flag on
the cover. Bragg, who recently published an essay on the BBC Web site
on a new sense of English identity, said he was astonished by the
number of St. George's flags flying at a summer rock concert at
Glastonbury, not usually considered a bastion of patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like that before, never," Bragg said in
an interview with The Times.</TE>
<TE>   He argues that the popularity of the St. George's flag is "not
just a 2002 phenomenon." Behind it, he says, is something more
thoughtful, a reassessment of what it is to be English, a more
inclusive multicultural identity, where national heroes are people
such as soccer star Rio Ferdinand and England's cricket captain,
Nasser Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Union Jack has connotations to do with Britain's
past," Bragg said. "I think of British culture as being rather
monocultural and that monoculture as centering around the monarchy,
the flag and the British empire. The English flag doesn't really have
those imperial connotations."</TE>
<TE>   In a recent paper for the London-based think tank the Institute
for Public Policy Research, author Mark Perryman linked soccer and
the rise of English patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer, Perryman and Bragg argue, is the kind of place where the
English do all kinds of things they'd never ordinarily think of
doing--scream and shout, hug the bloke sitting nearby, show pride in
being English. In soccer, the St. George's flag is the natural symbol
because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own teams and
flags in international competitions, except for the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Perryman is convinced that the move toward Britain's breakup is
inexorable.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that each time people put a St. George's cross on their
car aerial or put it on a badge or wear it as a T-shirt or paint it
on their sons' and daughters' faces, they are beginning to be aware
that England actually is a nation. You can go into any bookshop now
and see book after book about Englishness," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A History of Racism</TE>
<TE>   Akhtar, the entrepreneur, was born in London in the '60s when the
Union Jack was all the rage, plastered over Mini Minors and
miniskirts. But there was an uglier side to the patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   He was only 2 when Conservative politician Enoch Powell made an
infamous speech warning that "rivers of blood" would flow if
immigration wasn't halted. But Akhtar remembers the reverberations,
which continued for years.</TE>
<TE>   His father, a lawyer who spoke nine languages, was shunned by
clients. "I'm old enough to remember how difficult it was for Dad to
get work in those days because people thought it would be detrimental
to their case to have a brown face representing them," he said. "So
he was really nothing more than a glorified clerk."</TE>
<TE>   Now, many see the St. George's flag as a show of support for
multiculturalism.</TE>
<TE>   "If you see a man in a car next to you, how do you know what he's
feeling or thinking?" Akhtar asked. "If you see he has a flag, you
think, 'Good on you, you're one of us.' "</TE>
<TE>   For Bragg, England's soccer and cricket teams symbolize a new
vision of England because they are multicultural, while soccer
matches are places where people can comfortably express their pride
at being English.</TE>
<TE>   "In the football team and the cricket team, Englishness and
multiculturalism come together. The cricket team is captained by a
guy called Nasser Hussein, whose family are Indian Muslims," he said.
"Rio Ferdinand, who's a product of mixed-race marriage, is the new
Bobby Moore--our football captain in 1966 and a real iconic English
figure. Those things, I think, are really significant.</TE>
<TE>   "We see ourselves mirrored in that team. When you look at the
football team and you look at the royal family, which of those best
represents our country?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Redefining Englishness</TE>
<TE>   That some on the left are now embracing English nationalism seems
to signal a growing sense of ease about being an English patriot, not
just at the soccer stadium but also elsewhere in life.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of commentators, particularly on the liberal left,
who automatically assume that assertion of Englishness means an
assertion of far-right conservatism, Europhobia, racism, a
celebration of our imperial past. I refuse to accept that," Perryman
said. "If we're going to assume that Englishness must always mean
racism, xenophobia and Europhobia, violence, imperial domination and
so on, then we might as well give up on our national identity."</TE>
<TE>   In the Scotsman newspaper recently, columnist George Kerevan
described the surge of English nationalism as partly an inevitable
response to Scottish and Welsh devolution and partly a security
blanket after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   But he contended that to be successful, a nationalist movement
needs a substantial cause to rally around--something that English
nationalism lacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Why this surge of Englishness now? This summer's street parties
and flag-waving are not really about Elizabeth Windsor or David
Beckham," Kerevan argued, referring to the queen and the English
soccer captain. "They are a quiet sign the English are fed up with
politicians again and want something done.</TE>
<TE>   "Nationalism is about forging an inclusive common citizenship. To
do this, a successful nationalism needs a unifying myth. And here
lies the great contradiction of Englishness and with the difficulty
the ordinary English folk have in effecting political change. England
lacks a viable 'people' myth. The English remain subjects, not
citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of a new vision of English patriotism such as Bragg and
Perryman acknowledge that the lack of a political coat hanger--and an
attendant set of political demands--poses the threat that the idea
might lose momentum and fade away, leaving the English as insecure as
ever about their national identity.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no political movement around wanting an English
parliament, so that is problematic: What do you hang it on?" Perryman
asked.</TE>
<TE>   But Bragg insisted that "if Englishness resides anywhere, it
resides in a sense of communal experiences that we have, growing up
together in this space, watching the same TV programs, putting up
with the same weather. What that engenders is a sense of belonging."</TE>

<HD>Synergy Proved Their Undoing</HD>
<DH>Business: A turbulent season of corporate shakeups may
presage a return to conservative management principles for some media
giants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In June 2000, as they completed negotiations over a merger that would
create the world's second-largest entertainment conglomerate, Edgar
Bronfman Jr. pulled aside Jean-Marie Messier, whose Vivendi was about
to take over Bronfman's Seagram Co., the owner of Universal Studios
and other marquee properties.</LD>
<LD>   "You know what they say in the U.S. about entrepreneurial
families?" Bronfman asked, according to Messier's recollection. "The
first generation creates, the second makes the fortune, and the third
destroys it. I represent that third generation. But with [this
merger], I'm assuring the future of the generations to follow."</LD>
<LD>   Scarcely two years later, the merger launched with such great
expectations has cost the Bronfman family billions of dollars.
Messier has been unceremoniously ousted as chairman and chief
executive of Vivendi Universal, and the media giant he built is on
the verge of being dismantled by the French traditionalists who have
taken over.</LD>
<TE>   The upheaval at Vivendi Universal is only one of three
high-profile management shakeups to roil media conglomerates this
season. Just last week, the German publishing, music and television
conglomerate Bertelsmann ousted its chief executive, Thomas
Middelhoff, who was still talking up the benefits of media-Internet
"convergence" despite evidence that the policy had produced huge
losses at other companies.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner, also fashioned by merger in 2000, last month
pushed out Robert W. Pittman, the head of its AOL Internet unit and
formerly a candidate for chief executive; Gerald M. Levin, its chief
executive and an architect of the merger, resigned under pressure the
same month.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, each of these companies had unique problems--financial
and cultural--that contributed to the turbulence in the executive
suites. But the former leaders of AOL, Vivendi and Bertelsmann shared
a conviction that combining the Internet with leading entertainment
brand names--CNN and Warner Bros. in AOL's case, Universal Studios in
Vivendi's, and the distributors of Britney Spears and 'N Sync in
Bertelsmann's--would generate explosive growth in their profits and
stock prices. All were willing to borrow and spend heavily to reach
that nirvana. But as reality fell dramatically short of their
expansive visions, the demise of the executives behind them became
inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Other leading media companies that averted the latest turmoil also
face unsettled times, thanks to an advertising recession, poor
operational performance and questions about management succession.
From the downfall of their brethren, leaders throughout the industry
have learned that nothing should be concealed from shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors today are looking for complete and total transparency,"
said Walt Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Eisner, who has
come under pressure from investors and board members because of
lagging performance at almost all of the company's entertainment
divisions and a long-term decline in its stock.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some See a Return of Conservatives</TE>
<TE>   Media and entertainment experts believe that the turbulent summer
presages a new era of conservative management in the industry. Boards
and shareholders are likely to treat their CEOs' grandiose visions
more skeptically--a trend emerging across the business world. Some of
the combinations wrought over the last three or four years are likely
to be unwound, meaning that once-highly valued properties such as
Universal Studios, America Online, and the Universal and Bertelsmann
music groups may return to the sale table.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean that the original visions were entirely flawed,
only that the pioneers may have spent too much on premature
expectations of synergies between traditional media and novel
technologies such as the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think synergy as a concept is dead, but it has to arise
viscerally--come from a need rather than being imposed," said Barry
Meyer, chairman of AOL Time Warner's Warner Bros. movie and
television studio.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, however, the days of lavish overspending for Web
properties is long gone.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors need to get paid today rather than invest in the
promise of tomorrow," says Christopher Dixon, media analyst at UBS
Warburg. "When you throw in the management credibility at companies
like WorldCom, Enron and Arthur Andersen, why is anyone surprised
that investors and board of directors are looking to lower their
overall risk portfolios at the major media companies?"</TE>
<TE>   That new outlook represents the end of an era that lasted a scant
2 1/2 years, dating from the blockbuster merger announcement of AOL
and Time Warner in January 2000. In his autobiography "J6M"
(subtitled "Who's Afraid of the New Economy?"), Vivendi's Messier
recalled hearing the first word of the huge merger from Middelhoff
and thinking: "A mastodon has been born, lacking nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The news prompted him to redouble his efforts to reinvent the
water utility and real estate company of which he had become CEO in
1996. Under Messier, Vivendi had expanded rapidly into wireless
communications, pay TV, publishing, and Internet service, but he
still harbored a yen to add entertainment properties to the
portfolio. The AOL-Time Warner merger, he felt, validated his
conviction that owning both content providers and a means of
distribution over the Internet was the route to riches.</TE>
<TE>   The result was Vivendi's acquisition of Seagram, the Canadian
liquor distributor controlled by the Bronfman family. Under the
leadership of Edgar Bronfman Jr., a onetime songwriter, Seagram had
paid $5.7 billion for MCA--the owner of Universal--in 1995, selling
off $8.8 billion in DuPont stock to help finance the deal. Bronfman
subsequently acquired Polygram Records for $10.4 billion, solidifying
Universal's stature as the world's largest recording company.</TE>
<TE>   But Bronfman evidently still believed that MCA was too small to
compete in a world of media mastodons. Therefore he was receptive to
Messier's interest in adding the company to the Vivendi portfolio.
The acquisition was completed at the end of 2000 for $33 billion, of
which nearly $10 billion went to the family. One year later, Messier
acquired USA Networks, combining the television production and cable
company with Universal's television unit at a cost of an additional
$10.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   If Middelhoff's ambitions were not quite as grand at Bertelsmann,
the reason was the relative conservatism of the Mohn family, which
controlled the company through a family foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The boyish 49-year-old Middelhoff had given the company an early
entry into the Internet boom by becoming a 50% partner in AOL Europe;
when the company decided to sell its shares in March 2000 because of
antitrust pressure from the European Commission and its own
uneasiness at being in business with Time Warner, a potential rival,
it garnered a $7-billion profit.</TE>
<TE>   But Middelhoff's vision of a mass media empire clashed with the
company's past as a publisher of hymnals and stolid periodicals. He
proclaimed his intention to turn its music division, built in part
through the acquisition of Sony Music, into the world's largest. But
that dream was dashed by the EC's rejection of its proposed merger
with Britain's EMI Group.</TE>
<TE>   More curious was Middelhoff's dalliance with Napster, the
Internet-based music-sharing system that was under legal assault by
the recording industry, which charged that it was nothing more than a
device for copyright piracy. Bertelsmann spent an estimated $100
million trying to turn Napster into a system that would pass legal
muster--a project whose future has become exceedingly doubtful with
Middelhoff's departure.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Corporate Direction Unsettles Observers</TE>
<TE>   By late 2001, disaffection with the companies' acquisition
strategies was setting in among shareholders and entertainment
experts, particularly when the purchases were being financed with
borrowed money, as was the case at Vivendi and AOL.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all attempts by major media companies to build branded Web
sites to attract audiences had ended in costly failure: That year saw
the demise of Disney's Go.com, NBC's Snap.com and AOL Time Warner's
Entertaindom.com. Such companies as Viacom and Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp., which had taken their time plunging into the Internet and been
ridiculed for their tardiness, were now congratulated for their
prescience.</TE>
<TE>   "People have gone broke waiting for [convergence]," said Jon
Miller, former chief executive at USA Interactive's information and
services group (and the leading candidate to replace Pittman as head
of AOL's America Online unit).</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone looked at the Internet as the next growth engine after
analog cable channels maxed out," he said. But selling entertainment
content via the Internet did not seem to be a profitable business
model. The money was to be made online, as it turned out, in
transactional businesses like Ebay's auctions and the sale of concert
tickets and travel accommodations.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the merged media companies employees nursed resentments,
especially as investors beat down their share prices because the
promised synergies had not materialized. Stock options, which were
once worth more than cash salaries, were now worthless. Cultural
conflicts deepened between traditional media executives and Internet
entrepreneurs forced to work together. Earlier this year, senior
operational executives from the Time Warner side told incoming Chief
Executive Richard Parsons that they felt "betrayed" by the declining
fortunes of the company since the merger.</TE>
<TE>   By early 2002, the stock of Vivendi and AOL showed the toll.
Vivendi shares had declined by 75% in a year; AOL had lost roughly
90% of its value since the announcement of the merger.</TE>
<TE>   At privately controlled Bertelsmann, Middelhoff had bristled at
not having a publicly traded stock to use as currency in
acquisitions. But the relentless devaluation of media stocks made the
controlling family even more skeptical at his proposals to float
public shares. The Mohns had agreed to trade 25% of the company to
the investment firm Groupe Bruxelles Lambert on the understanding
that the shares could be publicly sold in 2005. But they retained the
right to buy them back before then, which could forestall the public
offering, and staunchly resisted Middelhoff's urging that they offer
as much as 49% of the company to the public.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CEOs Talk Big, Then Scale Back</TE>
<TE>   Like Middelhoff, the chief executives of AOL and Vivendi also
stood accused of over-promising gains from their mergers and
acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   AOL's Levin continued to promise strong revenue and profit gains
through 2001, even as the advertising market in traditional media
dried up and subscriber growth at America Online flattened; in the
first few months of 2002, the company had to scale back its forecasts
twice.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Messier who pushed the envelope the most. French
shareholders grew exasperated at his self-conversion to an
American-style star CEO, complete with a $17-million Manhattan
apartment and an adoring write-up in Vanity Fair, as corporate
results deteriorated.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks of each other, both Vivendi and AOL set dubious
financial records. In March, Vivendi announced an $11.8-billion loss
for 2001, the largest in French corporate history, thanks in part to
a $13-billion write-off of "goodwill," reflecting the reduced value
of many of its acquisitions. AOL followed in April by announcing a
$54-billion charge against earnings--the biggest write-off in U.S.
history--to reflect the diminished value of America Online since the
merger. Even that left $80 billion of goodwill on the company's
books, equal to half its total assets.</TE>
<TE>   The results set the stage for the coming executive ousters.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, the Bronfmans appeared to be suffering a powerful
bout of sellers' remorse, having seen the value of their 5.5% stake
in Vivendi reduced to less than $1 billion from $3 billion. The
Bronfmans had insisted on selling Seagram for Vivendi shares rather
than cash, evidently to avoid tax on the transaction; meanwhile, the
value of their $8.8-billion stake in DuPont would have ballooned to
$16.4 billion over seven years, had they not sold it to buy MCA.
Concluding that Messier was unable to assuage investors' concerns,
they allied with a board effort to throw him overboard. On July 2 he
was fired, replaced by a former French pharmaceutical executive cut
from more traditional cloth.</TE>
<TE>   At AOL, Parsons continued what appeared to be a purge of
executives from the old America Online. In addition to Pittman's
departure, at least four major former AOL executives have been moved
out of operational roles to various corporate Siberias. The last one
left, AOL founder and Chairman Steve Case, plays little if any role
in day-to-day operations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Incoming Leadership Faces Complex Task</TE>
<TE>   The new leaders at all three companies are now facing the
challenge of cleaning up their financial structures and unraveling
some of the more extreme ventures backed by their predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann's new chief executive, Gunter Thielen, a 22-year
veteran of the company, may consider selling off his lackluster
record division, Bertelsmann Music Group. Not only does BMG rank last
among the world's five recording giants, but its North American
division has failed to post a profit in nearly a decade. Last year,
the company lost more than $40 million. And now, because of a
controversial contract provision, BMG must pay a staggering $3
billion for Jive Zomba, an independent label with a small roster of
over-familiar pop stars including Spears, 'N Sync and the Backstreet
Boys.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner will have to find ways to stem the declining
subscriber growth at America Online and address the 42% decline in
online advertising and commerce revenue it suffered in the second
quarter this year, compared with the year earlier. But some analysts
downplay suggestions that AOL and Time Warner would split up,
particularly given that AOL has 30 million subscribers and is a
viable distribution outlet that benefits Time Warner's various
content businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "When you reach 25% of the TV households, that's something you
don't walk away from--not lightly," said Tom Wolzien, media analyst
for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   The most complicated task may be that facing the new management of
Vivendi, where Messier is judged to have assembled a stable of
properties without an overall strategy for integrating them. The
company is reportedly considering selling Canal Plus, its
money-losing French pay TV service, and its 44% holding of the French
phone company Cegetel. Selling Universal Studios and Universal Music
Group would probably be difficult in today's desultory market for
media properties; the company may consider spinning them off as a
separate public company to be run by the experienced Hollywood mogul
Barry Diller, the chairman of Vivendi Universal Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   For all that, many industry experts believe that the just-departed
generation of executives may eventually prove to have been prophets
before their time.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet, Wolzien says, "is a mass medium that ultimately
everybody will have to be actively involved in. In the long term, it
may well be they were correct strategically. But they were woefully
wrong in the handling of their investors' money."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   A Look at Entertainment's Fallen Chieftains</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Marie Messier</TE>
<TE>   Determined to reinvent sleepy French utility Vivendi as a media
"mastodon," the chairman and chief executive rapidly expanded into
wireless communications, pay TV, publishing, Internet service and
acquired Universal Studios and USA Networks. He was unceremoniously
ousted this spring after the company posted an $11.8-billion loss and
the stock dropped 75% in a year.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald M. Levin</TE>
<TE>   As head of Time Warner, he was a key architect of its merger with
AOL in 2000, and at the time touted the great "synergies" to be
achieved from combining the media and entertainment giant with the
leading Internet company. By 2002, AOL had recorded the biggest
financial write-off in U.S. history, the stock had lost roughly 90%
of its value and Levin had resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Middelhoff</TE>
<TE>   Within four years, the brash young chief of Bertelsmann turned the
stolid German company into one of the largest media conglomerates in
the world. He fiercely clung to the idea of media-Internet
"convergence." But his vision clashed with the conservative
controlling company, and he was replaced last week.</TE>

<HD>GOP Donors Slide Over to Davis Camp</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Corporate interests avoid Simon, helping the
incumbent to a big funding lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>From agriculture to the timber industry, some of California's biggest
Republican donors have switched their financial allegiance this
election to Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, effectively betting millions
of dollars on his return to office.</LD>
<LD>   In the process, corporate interests that might normally support a
business-friendly, small-government candidate like Bill Simon Jr. are
shunning the Republican gubernatorial nominee--or at least taking a
skeptical look at his candidacy.</LD>
<LD>   That, in turn, has helped Davis build a commanding lead in
fund-raising and further lengthened the steep odds that Simon faces
trying to become the first challenger in 60 years to deny a sitting
California governor a second term.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think any of us want to throw money away on a campaign
without being convinced it can win," John J. Coffey, general manager
of government relations for ChevronTexaco Corp., said of the
struggling Simon. "Maybe at some point you get there, but not yet."</TE>
<TE>   Davis was elected governor thanks in good part to the support of
organized labor. But from the time he took office in January 1999,
the Democrat has courted the state's business community, including
industries that lavishly supported his last Republican opponent,
former Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has been one of the business community's better friends in
Sacramento, especially given his veto power over the more liberal
Democrats who control the state Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   And his outreach to business has been richly rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   The California Real Estate Assn.'s political action committee has
given Davis more than $100,000 this year, including the cost of
holding a fund-raiser, according to a Times analysis of the
governor's fund-raising receipts.</TE>
<TE>   Timber interests, which heavily funded Lungren's campaign, have
donated more than $450,000 to Davis. The agricultural industry, long
one of the most reliable sources of Republican campaign cash, has
given roughly $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't made everyone happy," said Bill Pauli, president of the
California Farm Bureau, which has yet to formally endorse a candidate
in the governor's race. "But he hasn't made everyone angry. Nobody
gets everything they want, by any measure."</TE>
<TE>   Critics, led by Simon, say there is more at work than just a
moderate approach to governing. They say Davis has fostered a
"pay-to-play" atmosphere in Sacramento, requiring businesses and
industry lobbyists to give to Davis just to get a fair hearing on
policy and political appointments.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis is using every instrument that he has to employ a campaign
of terror and threats and extortion against the business community,"
said Shawn Steel, chairman of the California Republican Party. "He's
made it abundantly clear to supporters that those who give money to
Simon will pay a price if he gets reelected."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Donors Called Fearful</TE>
<TE>   Steel and other Republicans say that, with a spiteful governor
watching, many potential donors are too frightened to give to Simon,
even if his free-market, anti-regulatory philosophy is more in line
with their beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have told me they'll be 'crucified' ... the word
I've probably heard most often," said Kristin Hueter, a San
Francisco-based GOP fund-raiser who works for Simon. "People say to
me, 'We don't want to endure the governor's wrath.' "</TE>
<TE>   Davis and his spokesmen vehemently deny any connection between the
contributions he receives and his actions as governor. But the
perception that Davis is closely watching who gives what to whom is
firmly fixed in the minds of many who do business in Sacramento,
which can have the same intimidating effect.</TE>
<TE>   "I call it the fear factor," said Bob Stern, president of the
Center for Governmental Studies, a nonprofit organization in Los
Angeles that studies campaign finance matters. "If you don't give,
what's he going to do?"</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign is hardly bashful about its aggressive
fund-raising tactics.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Strategist's Warning</TE>
<TE>   In September, Davis' chief political strategist, Garry South, sent
a memo to the governor's political supporters warning that any
campaign contributions given to his Republican rival, Richard
Riordan, would be "instantly transparent" under new public disclosure
laws.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Riordan seemed to pose the most serious political
threat to Davis, who ultimately helped dispatch the former Los
Angeles mayor in the GOP primary with a $10-million negative ad
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and Riordan shared many of the same centrist political
friends and supporters, South said in an interview, and the memo was
intended to say, "Look, folks, this is war. This is not about giving
$500 to United Way and then giving $500 to the Red Cross....Part of
our message to them was, people who claim they're very close personal
friends of Gov. Davis don't give $50,000 to someone who's beating our
brains out."</TE>
<TE>   South insisted "there was no threat, either implied or suggested."
But, he later added, "If the memo stopped money from going to
Riordan, more power to me."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has done more, however, than just scare potential donors
away from his opponents.</TE>
<TE>   While wooing business interests, Davis also has managed to stay in
the good graces of most of his traditional Democratic allies.
Foremost among them is organized labor. His largest single source of
money is labor unions, which have given Davis more than $4 million so
far this year, or nearly 30% of what he has raised.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's handling of workers' compensation legislation
illustrates how Davis has sought to straddle competing interests,
keeping both sides contented and willing to contribute to his
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   For three years, Davis vetoed bills to increase the benefits paid
to workers injured on the job. Business representatives fiercely
opposed the increase, saying it would kill jobs and cost employers
billions in added expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Davis finally signed a version of the legislation in February,
just as he formally kicked off his reelection drive at the state
Democratic Party convention. While some business lobbyists grumbled,
Davis' signature headed off a threatened labor-supported ballot
measure that could have cost employers even more.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the governor has raised more than $50 million toward his
reelection. Simon, a Los Angeles investment banker making his first
try for public office, has collected $22 million, including $5
million he loaned his campaign and hundreds of thousands more from
his brother and sisters. Davis had $31.6 million in cash on hand as
of June 30, the close of the most recent reporting period, while
Simon had roughly $5 million in the bank.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in
contributions from many of the state's most faithful Republican
givers, among them businessmen Alex Spanos and David Murdock. But a
listing of Simon's donations is most noteworthy for what is not
there.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, many donors gave roughly equal amounts to Davis
and Lungren. E&amp;J Gallo, for one, gave $104,000 to the state attorney
general and $100,000 to Davis. This time out, the huge winery and
agricultural concern has given no money to Simon and donated $215,000
to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co.--traditionally a major GOP giver--donated $300,000
to Lungren, while Chevron (which completed a merger with Texaco last
year) donated $207,000 to the Republican during the 1998 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Since Davis took office, Irvine Co. has donated $73,152 to him and
held at least one Davis fund-raiser. ChevronTexaco has given Davis
$216,000. Neither has donated to Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis has not been a bad governor," said Coffey of
ChevronTexaco. "He has not been a particular friend to us. But we
don't have a relationship with Simon, either....I don't see us
spending that much money on the governor's race."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Series of Missteps</TE>
<TE>   The Republican's continuing series of missteps--from staff
upheavals to controversies over his taxes to last week's $78-million
fraud judgment--have hardly been helpful to Simon's fund-raising
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   While business interests are looking for a friend in the
governor's seat, "they're also going to evaluate the likelihood of
who's going to occupy the governor's office after November," said
Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.
"That will have an influence on their contributions."</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans think would-be Simon donors are simply holding
back, waiting for the end of the crucial bill-signing period Sept.
30, five weeks before election day.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have no balance in government, when one party totally
controls, if they want to reward or punish you they're in a position
to do that," said Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho
Cucamonga. "Gov. Davis' chief spokesman made it clear: You contribute
against the governor at your own risk."</TE>
<TE>   The Farm Bureau's Pauli said the Republican-leaning organization
won't make its endorsement until next month. The bureau is battling
legislation by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco)
that would grant farm workers the right to binding arbitration in
labor disputes. How Davis acts--whether he signs or vetoes the
bill--will be a "defining" moment, Pauli said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the governor's GOP rival, "Are you really going to write a
six-figure check when you're waiting for Simon to show some clear
vision?" Pauli said. "It is easy to criticize Davis. But Mr. Simon,
give us a view on some of these issues."</TE>

<HD>Colleges Feeling Market Decline</HD>
<DH>Economy: Some major gifts are being scaled back or delayed,
and endowments have declined. Most officials foresee no immediate
cutbacks on campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON and ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colleges and universities nationwide, many already hurting from the
slow economy, are feeling a further pinch as the volatile stock
market shrinks the value of their investments and makes some donors
skittish.</LD>
<LD>   "People are nervous about their own futures right now, and some
are backing off from making long-term commitments to major gifts,"
said Nancy Strouse, senior director of development at California
Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   College administrators in California and across the country say
some donors, especially those whose wealth derives from hard-hit
technology stocks, are seeking to delay gift payments, reducing the
amount of major donations or opting to wait before making good on
earlier pledges.</LD>
<TE>   The Council for Advancement and Support of Education, which tracks
such gifts, says it expects the fiscal year ended June 30 to show a
drop in donations nationally for the first time since 1974.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the value of many university endowments has
plummeted, especially since early June. Though the figures in most
cases are not yet complete, many college administrators are
predicting declines in their institutions' portfolio values of 8% to
10% for the fiscal year just ended.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gone quickly from where it was great, to look at the daily
stock quotes, to where you just don't want to look," said Al Horvath,
vice president for business and finance at Caltech. He said that the
value of the Pasadena institution's endowment has fallen from a high
of $1.5 billion in early 2001 to about $1.2 billion now, but that the
drop so far has not had any major effect on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Colleges' reliance on endowments for such day-to-day expenses as
financial aid, faculty salaries and maintenance varies widely.</TE>
<TE>   At some schools, endowment money makes up a third or more of the
annual budget; at other schools, much less. But the accounts assume
even greater significance, experts say, as a cushion in tough
economic times.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, college administrators in California and
elsewhere do not predict immediate cutbacks as a result of the stock
plunge. But some worry that if the rebound is not sustained, they may
have to consider such steps as dropping academic programs, freezing
faculty salaries and deferring maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all kind of sweating it in the current environment, but we
don't expect any immediate impact," said Jacqueline Doud, president
of Mount St. Mary's College in Los Angeles. The endowment for the
small Catholic school fell about 8% in the year ending June 30, Doud
said, dropping to about $40 million.</TE>
<TE>   At a handful of schools, the pain is already evident.</TE>
<TE>   At Wheaton College in Illinois, a fund-raising campaign that ended
in June fell far short of its $13.5-million goal for a new student
center, garnering just $7.7 million, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Administrators at the small Christian college near Chicago had
expected little trouble raising the money after a larger campaign
completed the previous year more than met its goals.</TE>
<TE>   "People are not saying we don't need a [new] student center," said
Mark Dillon, the college's vice president for advancement, explaining
that the project will be delayed for at least a year. "It's just
coming a little slower than we would like."</TE>
<TE>   The unsettled market and plunging tech stocks also forced a delay
in a major payment on a $250-million gift to the University of
Colorado. At the time the gift was announced in January 2001, it was
the largest ever to a public university.</TE>
<TE>   But last week, university officials said Internet entrepreneur
William T. Coleman III and his wife, Claudia, had deferred--until
2006--a $40-million payment that was to have been made last November.
A second major payment--$50 million due this November--also may be
delayed.</TE>
<TE>   The total amount of the gift, based on stock in Coleman's company,
San Jose-based BEA Systems, also may be reduced, said David Braddock,
associate vice president for research at the university.</TE>
<TE>   Braddock, who will head the cognitive disabilities institute that
is the gift's focus, said the Colemans already have given more than
$15 million to launch the institute. "We know the Colemans are
profoundly committed to following through if they can," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two California universities that also received huge pledges last
year from technology leaders--$600 million to Caltech from Intel
founder Gordon Moore and his wife, and $400 million to Stanford from
the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation--say there is no word of
delays on those gifts.</TE>
<TE>   In fiscal 2001, despite the markets' decline, gifts to colleges
and universities nationwide rose 4.3% to $24.2 billion, according to
the Council for Advancement and Support of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Vance Peterson, president of the Washington-based council, said he
expects the final figures for the year ending June 30 to show a drop.
"We're hearing that a number of institutions have either delayed
announcing campaigns or are hearing from donors who wish to
renegotiate pledge payments," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There are notable exceptions to the downtrend.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at USC and Claremont's Pomona College said that their
schools managed to set fund-raising records for the most recent year.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of several multimillion-dollar gifts, USC took in
$500 million in cash donations for the fiscal year just ended,
compared with $300 million the year before, university officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pomona, with just 1,500 students, said it took in $48 million for
the same period, including a gift of $23.3 million in June from the
estate of the late oilman Frank R. Seaver.</TE>
<TE>   But officials at other schools said their fund-raising fell short
of expectations or dropped for the year.</TE>
<TE>   "People are telling us they support the university, but this is
just not the right time," said Strouse of Cal Lutheran. "They're
asking us to give them time to see where they are."</TE>
<TE>   She said donations to the college's annual fund--which attracts
smaller, unrestricted gifts, mostly from alumni--were down about 10%
for the year, although overall giving was up, the result of
foundation gifts based on proposals written in earlier years.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford University, whose fiscal year ends in August, also
expects 2002 donations to fall short of the previous year's $469
million, itself down from a record $581 million in 2000, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford and other schools also are concerned by the recent plunge
in the value of their investment portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   After years of major gains, the average university endowment lost
3.6% on its investments in fiscal 2001, the first negative return
since 1984, according to an annual survey by the National Assn. of
College and University Business Officers.</TE>
<TE>   For most schools, the recent losses were even worse, several
experts said, although the fiscal 2002 figures are not yet final.</TE>
<TE>   "We're expecting high single-digit losses for the year just ended,
if not into the double digits," said John Griswold, senior vice
president of the Commonfund, a Wilton, Conn.-based nonprofit
organization that manages endowment assets for 1,600 colleges,
private high schools and other nonprofit groups.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of schools will be trying to rein in their operating
budgets, and that's tough to do because a lot of their costs, like
salaries, are pretty much baked in," Griswold said.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as June 1, Stanford officials were still expecting a
positive year for their $7.5-billion endowment. A month later, the
fund was down about 3%, said Michael McCaffery, president and chief
executive of Stanford Management Co., which oversees the endowment.</TE>
<TE>   Others experienced bad times earlier. The value of Boston
University's endowment dropped nearly 27% in fiscal 2001, to $674
million from $930 million a year earlier, officials said, and has
fallen further since. The campus has enacted a partial hiring freeze
and a tuition increase, but officials say those were not directly
related to the investment losses.</TE>
<TE>   College endowments also have suffered in Wall Street's recent
corporate accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   The University of California, for example, lost $352.5 million
from its pension and endowment funds this year in the collapse of
WorldCom Inc., and lost an additional $145 million in Enron Corp.
investments. The university is the lead plaintiff in a shareholder
class-action lawsuit against the former energy giant.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials said neither loss would affect the university's
ability to provide pension benefits to its employees. As of June 30,
the nine-campus system managed $51.1 billion in its retirement and
endowment portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   To soften the effect of market losses, colleges typically average
their endowments' values over three years and spend a fixed
percentage of that amount.</TE>
<TE>   But after two years of diminishing endowments, many educational
institutions--like stockholders everywhere--are watching the market
with growing anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're all anticipating some pretty bleak numbers for the
next year," said Larry Goldstein, senior fellow at the university
business officers association. "It's not over yet."</TE>

<HD>In Newport Rocker Reprise, Dylan Just One of the Folks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEWPORT, R.I.</DL>
<LD>After 37 years away, Bob Dylan brought it back home Saturday to the
Newport Folk Festival and reminded an audience of old fans and new
that the times are not only a-changin'--they've changed.</LD>
<LD>   The 61-year-old singer-songwriter made no mention of the fact that
he was returning to the festival for the first time since 1965, when
he startled the music world as a skinny, bushy-haired 24-year-old by
taking the stage with an electric guitar.</LD>
<LD>   At Newport in 1965, Dylan signaled a new age in pop culture by
fusing the commentary of folk music with the energy and dynamics of
rock 'n' roll.</LD>
<TE>   By doing so, he helped change rock 'n' roll from a simple,
teen-directed sound into an art form through which young songwriters
could express themselves with intelligence and imagination.</TE>
<TE>   It was a courageous move for Dylan because he was already hailed
as the great young hope of folk music, thanks to a series of songs,
such as "The Times They Are A-Changin' " and "Blowin' in the Wind,"
that linked him with the classic tradition of Woody Guthrie. By
moving to rock, he risked losing his already considerable audience.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some of the folk crowd at Newport reacted with boos. But
Dylan would go on to new heights of popularity, and rock itself was
forever changed. Everyone from John Lennon to Bruce Springsteen has
cited Dylan's move into rock 'n' roll as a major influence on their
own musical development.</TE>
<TE>   As 10,000 spectators watched Saturday from lawn chairs or on
picnic blankets, and perhaps 1,000 more from a flotilla of boats in
Newport Harbor, there were no jeers--only cheers--as Dylan, wearing a
cowboy hat, alternated almost song by song between his acoustic and
electric guitars to perform such standards as "Desolation Row," "Mr.
Tambourine Man" and "Positively 4th Street."</TE>
<TE>   As evening settled on a sun-baked day, Dylan performed four
encores to cap a two-hour show. He and three other band members
pounding away at electric guitars for a rollicking "Like a Rolling
Stone," then replacing all four guitars with acoustic models to play
"Blowin' in the Wind."</TE>
<TE>   But what once were protest songs now had a crowd that included
former Vice President Al Gore and actor Richard Gere waving their
arms and dancing on the lawns outside the Civil War-era Ft. Adams.</TE>
<TE>   The producers of the festival said Dylan insisted they make no
fuss about his "return" when he agreed to come back this spring,
asking them to "treat this as another gig." Indeed, the May press
release announcing details of the three-day event mentioned first
that it had a new sponsor--a fruit juice company--before listing the
"roster of talent" and naming Dylan, Shawn Colvin, Arlo Guthrie, Dar
Williams and others, with no reference to this being the headliner's
first trip here in 37 years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just Another Gig</TE>
<TE>   In effect, it was just another "gig" for Dylan, who has been on a
busy tour with his band and performed Friday night an easy drive
away, in Worcester, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was Dylan returning to the exact turf where he performed in
1965. Back then, the concerts were staged on a field mostly used for
drying fishing nets. The festival now is held at Ft. Adams State
Park, on Newport Harbor, with the $55 tickets good for a full day of
music on several stages--though performances on the others ceased
before Dylan went on in the late afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, however much Dylan might have wanted it to be a routine
appearance, it was anything but that for a crowd that included some
of the key players in the events of 1965, and many others who claimed
to have been there, though those numbers--as with other such defining
moments in pop culture--tend to grow over the years, as do the tales
of what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Dylan performed five songs that 1965 night, but accounts of what
happened vary with the witness. Was folk music's elder statesman,
Pete Seeger, really so enraged that he nearly took an ax to the cable
electrifying Dylan's music? Was the booing because of Dylan's new
sound or because he got off the stage so quickly? Was there actually
that much booing?</TE>
<TE>   In fact, promoters say, Dylan was supposed to perform only a few
numbers in 1965. In the manner of festival concerts at the time, a
dozen performers had to be on and off the stage in little more than
two hours. Dylan's electrified sound wasn't a surprise to the
organizers, either.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota-born songwriter had quickly become a star in the
Greenwich Village folk scene in New York but had shown signs of what
would be a lifetime of musical experimentation by releasing his rock
'n' roll single "Like a Rolling Stone" shortly before the festival.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many in the crowd were not ready for what they heard that
night, when Dylan--in a black leather jacket and with the Paul
Butterfield Blues Band at his side--performed a sizzling "Maggie's
Farm."</TE>
<TE>   He sang, "I try my best to be just like I am.../...But everybody
wants you to be just like them.../...They say, 'Sing while you
slave'.../...I just get bored.../I... ain't gonna work on Maggie's
farm no more."</TE>
<TE>   Then he launched into angry riffs on the electric guitar, a
counterpoint to the pretty voices and folk harmonies that had come
before.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fans 'Totally Confused'</TE>
<TE>   "The audience was totally confused," George Wein said in an
interview just before this festival. Wein, 76, founded the festival
in 1959 and is the executive producer. He recalls some cheers then
for Dylan but also shouts of "sellout."</TE>
<TE>   Wein was the one who tried to calm Seeger, the banjo-playing
activist who had worked for years to preserve the traditions of folk
music, which was replete with protest songs but done in earnest,
mournful tones.</TE>
<TE>   Seeger did not have an ax, Wein said, but he did complain, "That
noise is terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Wein said he met Dylan coming off the stage and told the young
songwriter, "You have to go back.... Do something acoustic."</TE>
<TE>   Dylan obliged with two more songs, ending with "It's All Over Now,
Baby Blue."</TE>
<TE>   At a time when folk groups like Peter, Paul &amp; Mary were powerful
commercial forces, and rock's British invasion, led by the Beatles,
was still cresting, Dylan's performance was "a farewell to the
idealism and the purity of the folk revival," Wein said.</TE>
<TE>   As he sees it, Dylan was telling his young folk fans "who had
resisted the mainstream tastes of their friends" that the new realm
of plugged-in rock "was no longer taboo."</TE>
<TE>   To Peter, Paul &amp; Mary's Peter Yarrow, who served as master of
ceremonies much of the night, the event signaled the emotion behind
the emerging youth culture that was pushing for a "greening of
America" and rebelling against a materialistic society seen as phony,
mean-spirited and cruelly hierarchical. To them, folk music, with
it's unadorned guitar chords, represented "speaking from the heart,
an authentic exchange," Yarrow said.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there was booing, Yarrow says, but also "shocked
silence--gasping and silence."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly four decades later, Yarrow said it's clear that those fans
booing, though honestly feeling betrayed at the time, were wrong to
view electric sound as dooming authenticity. Performers such as
Springsteen have shown "it's absolutely not a matter of
instrumentation," Yarrow said. "It's a matter of the heart." In
addition, it's often the rock stars who today lead social causes, as
folk artists once did.</TE>
<TE>   But if some didn't like what they heard from Dylan in 1965, others
embraced his new sound.</TE>
<TE>   "It turned an important corner for those of us at a certain age,"
said Arlo Guthrie, the son of Woody Guthrie and the headliner of
today's conclusion of the festival. "We wanted to be able to express
ourselves in a modern format ... to continue the evolution of folk
music and not have it be a static academic exercise ... rather than
play it back like a parrot."</TE>
<TE>   The festival had a picnic-like atmosphere Saturday, with
patrons--some arriving by ferry--carrying their own chairs or
blankets and wandering by rows of tents selling everything from
lobster rolls to tie-dyed peace-symbol T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Though most of the concert-goers had not been born when Dylan last
appeared, others swapped memories of "the last one."</TE>
<TE>   For Barry Lipnick and his wife, Louise, this was--as for Dylan--a
first trip back to Newport since 1965. They were in their "early 20s"
then, and "now we're older," said Barry, wearing khakis, sandals and
a floppy hat.</TE>
<TE>   "We've heard him many times in between," said Louise, an
elementary school teacher and mother of three, wearing purple nail
polish and colorful loop bracelets on her wrist. She liked Dylan's
earliest songs best, "with their messages of peace and revolution."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dylan 'Does What He Wants'</TE>
<TE>   While the occasion was enough to bring them all the way from
Seattle, they understood why Dylan might want to simply play his
music and not acknowledge the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "He does what he wants," Barry Lipnick said, "as he always does."</TE>
<TE>   As he took the stage Saturday, Dylan remained a heralded figure in
U.S. pop music. His last two albums, 1997's "Time Out of Mind" and
2001's "Love and Theft," are among his most acclaimed. "Time Out of
Mind" won a Grammy for best album of the year, and "Love and Theft"
was nominated for the same award.</TE>
<TE>   The media-shy performer did not meet with reporters here to
discuss the landmark 1965 day. In an interview last year with The
Times, however, Dylan spoke about being booed at Newport.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't worry about things like that," he said then. "Miles
Davis has been booed. Hank Williams was booed. Stravinsky was booed.
You're nobody if you don't get booed sometime."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>As History Repeats Itself, the Scholar Becomes the Story</HD>
<DH>Doris Kearns Goodwin's highly public life has taken many
turns. Questions of plagiarism--and how it is defined--are just one
chapter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER H. KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CONCORD, Mass.</DL>
<LD>In early January, an anonymous letter arrived at the Washington,
D.C., office of the Weekly Standard. It was addressed to Executive
Editor Fred Barnes, who had written a piece suggesting that historian
Stephen E. Ambrose's book about World War II bombers contained some
passages "barely distinguishable" from another author's work.</LD>
<LD>   The mystery correspondent opened with a salute, saying Barnes had
been "quite right" to expose Ambrose, and then moved on to the main
business of the missive--ratting out another celebrity historian:
"I've long been concerned by several instances of plagiarism I noted
long ago in Doris Kearns Goodwin's 'The Fitzgeralds and the
Kennedys.' I believe she ought to be called to account, just as
Professor Ambrose has."</LD>
<LD>   Passages from the Goodwin book and other Kennedy histories were
set down for comparison, beginning with a three-sentence snippet that
appeared to be borrowed from a biography of Kathleen Kennedy by Lynne
McTaggart, a London-based writer. McTaggart, it would develop, had
accused Goodwin long ago of "slavishly" copying her work, a complaint
that led to a secret legal settlement.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ... her closest friends [went the McTaggart passage] assumed she
and Billy were 'semiengaged.' On the day of the party reports of a
secret engagement were published in the Boston papers ... The truth
was that the young couple had reached no such agreement.</TE>
<TE>   ... her closest friends [echoed the Goodwin text, published four
years after McTaggart's] assumed she and Billy were semi-engaged. On
the day of the party, reports of a secret engagement were published
in the Boston papers ... The truth was that the young couple had
reached no such agreement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Four more examples from other books followed. Titles, publishers
and page numbers were noted, providing Barnes--or, as it turned out,
a Weekly Standard research assistant--with a ready-mix case to whip
up against the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian.</TE>
<TE>   The tipster, identified in the letter as an "academic historian
living in the Northeastern U.S.," closed on a goading note: "Mr.
Barnes, I am not sending this tip to any other press outlet for the
time being. I'll wait to see what you do with it."</TE>
<TE>   And with that it began, a literary dust-up that would engulf
Goodwin, one of the nation's most popular and publicly visible
historians. Whether her work was tainted would be debated in
newspaper columns, on academic Web sites and on the very talking-head
television shows where Goodwin so often played the role of quick-draw
historian--always ready with a charmingly told anecdote about how
Rutherford B. Hayes or Woodrow Wilson dealt in his White House days
with whatever dilemma was confronting the current occupant.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin was not without defenders. Some came to see in her story
one more instance of the machinery of American fame lifting up
someone only to drop her down again. Professional jealousy received
frequent mention as a motive driving her detractors. At the same
time, there were academicians who took from the affair a lesson on
the perils of assembly-line scholarship. Still others painted it as
part of a larger trend in lost standards and accountability, casting
Goodwin as a sort of Kenneth L. Lay of letters.</TE>
<TE>   In her own mind, Goodwin was not--is not--a plagiarist. She takes
pains to avoid the very word, referring to the McTaggart business as
"that mistake" or "this thing I have done" or simply "it." In an
interview, the only time she uttered the word "plagiarism" was to
deny committing it in the Kennedy book: "You know, at the time the
book was written, it absolutely required intent to deceive in order
to be plagiarism. And no one is claiming that. No one is claiming
that there was any intent."</TE>
<TE>   Her defense has been that she was guilty only of a "mechanical
breakdown," a misdemeanor of sloppy footnoting and subpar
paraphrasing in what was her first attempt at a major history. She
also maintains that after the Kennedy book, her methodology was
cleaned up, so that when it came to "No Ordinary Time," her
Pulitzer-winning history of Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt in
wartime, "things got checked. We knew. We'd been through this."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, an examination of that book against a handful of the
hundreds of texts listed in the bibliography did turn up instances of
what appear to be parallel language usage and similarly constructed
sentences. For example, on Page 635 of Joseph Lash's "Eleanor and
Franklin," published in 1971, this passage is found:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ... so Eleanor composed herself, returned to the living room, and
said in her most disarming manner: "It is kind of Mr. Aldrich to
offer to be chairman, but is it not better from the point of view of
geography to have someone from the Middle West?" At that, she turned
to Marshall Field; she knew it was a bothersome responsibility, she
said, but could he accept the chairmanship? Somewhat startled, the
Chicago philanthropist and stalwart New Dealer did.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While on Page 99 of Goodwin's book, published in 1994:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ... Eleanor quickly composed herself, walked back into the living
room, and said in her most disarming manner, "It was kind of Mr.
Aldrich to offer to be chairman, but is it not better from the point
of view of geography to have someone from the Middle West?" At that,
she turned immediately to Chicago philanthropist and New Deal
loyalist Marshall Field; she knew it would be a bother for him, but
could he accept? Though caught somewhat off guard, Field gave his
assent ..."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now, is this adequate paraphrasing, describing how Eleanor "walked
back" rather than "returned" to the living room, and so forth? Or are
quotation marks required to credit Lash's prose? Goodwin does include
a footnote in the back of the book--99 "It was kind ... ": Lash,
Eleanor and Franklin, p.635--but one that might be read as a
reference to Eleanor Roosevelt's remark, and not all the framing
language.</TE>
<TE>   Over such picked nits and nuances are battles over plagiarism
waged. Cases of clear-cut, wholesale appropriations are rare. Far
more common are disputes over what Thomas Mallon, author of "Stolen
Words," a definitive work on the subject, has termed "tweezered
rip-offs." A phrase here, a sentence there: Pile on enough of these,
and at some inexact point what might be excused as mere sloppiness
begins to generate charges of plagiarism.</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Goodwin emphatically insists that the Roosevelt
book, above passage included, "meets the highest standards of
historical scholarship," adding: "... the standard to be met in every
instance is providing appropriate credit to the source from which
this material was obtained. How this is mechanically done differs
from author to author and publisher to publisher. But I have complete
confidence in the method I have chosen."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Writer's Story Took 'On a Life of Its Own'</TE>
<TE>   On a midsummer morning, Goodwin was perched on the edge of a sofa
in her 19th century farmhouse a few miles outside Concord,
absent-mindedly picking at a rubber band as she recounted her run
through the literary grinder. Six months had passed since her story
broke, months that Goodwin complained might have been devoted to her
new history of Abraham Lincoln and his Cabinet but instead were
"lost" working to salvage her reputation.</TE>
<TE>   For reasons she cannot quite identify, her story took "on a life
of its own," became "a frenzy." Perhaps it was her public visibility.
Perhaps it was the ever-churning nature of the modern news cycle. She
doesn't know.</TE>
<TE>   Seated across the room in an easy chair was her husband, Richard
Goodwin, a former speechwriter and political confidant of the
Kennedys, Lyndon B. Johnson and others. Married for 26 years, the
Goodwins are a couple who in conversation tend to finish one
another's sentences, just as at the keyboard they help each other
polish their prose. At one point in the conversation, Doris Goodwin
stopped, searching for a literary reference.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that Hemingway quote?" she asked Richard Goodwin.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is broken by life ..." he prompted.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is broken by life," she said, "but some people are
stronger in the broken places."</TE>
<TE>   "Afterwards some people are stronger," he corrected.</TE>
<TE>   "Afterwards some people are stronger," she repeated.</TE>
<TE>   In the early months, she said, when the Sunday New York Times was
publishing a parody expose of "Wait Till Next Year," her baseball
memoir, and the Harvard Crimson was demanding her ouster from the
university's Board of Overseers, and assorted universities were
debating the propriety of allowing her to appear on their campuses,
"I couldn't see how it could end. It just kept going on, day after
day."</TE>
<TE>   The historian soon found herself saddled with punishments peculiar
to the realm of celebrity scholars. Several of her paid speaking
engagements were canceled. She was disinvited from her place on
public television's "NewsHour With Jim Lehrer." Her seat on the
prestigious board that awards Pulitzers was put in question. A friend
described her as "almost in a state of disbelief, shock, depression."</TE>
<TE>   She nodded toward her husband: "He was absolutely certain it would
end, and I would be all right. He kept telling me, 'Your reputation
would be basically what it was on the basis of a lifetime, not on the
basis of just this one thing.' " He also reminded her that this
wasn't her first high-profile pickle.</TE>
<TE>   "When I would say to Dick, 'You know, I have never been through
anything like this before,' he'd say, 'Well, you know, you were.' "</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin's first dip in the waters of infamy came in 1967, when,
having received a White House fellowship, she was photographed
dancing with Lyndon Johnson at a reception. The story turned on the
fact that the president's dance partner, then Doris Kearns, had just
co-written a piece for the New Republic under the headline: "How to
Remove L.B.J. in 1968."</TE>
<TE>   Later, in the early 1970s, Kearns and Richard Goodwin, lovers but
not yet married, set off a literary scandal that attracted national
media attention. It involved a "psychobiography" that Kearns was
writing about Johnson, based in part on intimate conversations they'd
had on his ranch in Texas, and a decision to bring Goodwin aboard as
a co-author.</TE>
<TE>   Their plan was to expand what had begun as a scholarly
work--intended to help secure for her a tenured professorship at
Harvard University--break with a smaller publishing house and sell
the book elsewhere, for about five times the money. As the dispute
grew, the story oozed outward to include speculation in print about
whether Kearns might have had an affair with Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Sally Quinn, flying at her highest as a feature writer in the
Washington Post's Style section, wrote a lively, at times almost
embarrassingly explicit, account of the chaos that had come to
Kearn's love and literary life. The piece ran for what seemed like
forever, and it included a rather tart summation:</TE>
<TE>   "Kearns has always gotten what she wanted--and made it look as if
she didn't even try. She got elected student-body president at Colby
College in Maine, got the best grades, got the best beaux, got into
Harvard, got a White House fellowship, got Lyndon Johnson, got her
Ph.D, got her professorship at Harvard, got her book, got author
Richard Goodwin and got Goodwin to collaborate with her on the book.
Those are all things she wanted, or thought she wanted when she got
them."</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the story, the then-32-year-old Kearns is quoted
as saying: "I really believe that Johnson was picking a person he
wanted to write about him. People say he was in love with me and
things like that. Partly that's true. But it was much more serious
than that."</TE>
<TE>   In short, it was the sort of ink that would make anybody with a
jot of modesty want to hole up in the back stacks of a public library
for a decade or so. Which is pretty much what Kearns did. At Harvard,
questions had been raised about Richard Goodwin's participation in
the book, also about the hiring of a fiction writer to help edit the
manuscript. Her certain candidacy for tenure became clouded and a
source of controversy on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the question seemed about to come to a head, however, the
matter disappeared from public view: Kearns decided not to press the
issue. After accepting an untenured associate professorship, she
eventually left the university and set out on her own as a writer.
Along the way, she married Goodwin, gave birth and finished the
Johnson book. It carried only her byline, and it became a bestseller.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, Doris Goodwin  would say it worked out well. She
built a life for herself here that allowed her to both rear children
and write. She became a fixture at the Concord library, scribbling
away in longhand on her Kennedy book, shelves of biographies and
other reference sources just a few steps away. And when the book came
out, she told the Washington Post that her wild ride of a decade
before had taught her something important about the nature of
notoriety:</TE>
<TE>   "I saw how you could be in the newspapers every day for a few days
and then it was gone. All that people remembered was that you had
been in the papers. They didn't remember what was pro or con about
it."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Goodwin said, until a question about the Quinn article
came up in connection with this piece, "I had forgotten about it."</TE>
<TE>   Published in 1987, the Kennedy book was well received. Among the
reviewers was Lynne McTaggart, who wrote that she was impressed with
Goodwin's scholarship, but who did not write that some of the prose
seemed awfully familiar. "I wrote a kind review," she recalled many
years later in the New York Times, "then hired a copyright lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   Doris Goodwin was not keen on talking much about her Harvard
scrape or anything else in her past, and this includes the McTaggart
business; she prefers, she said, to keep focused on the future. Late
in the interview, and with a wary reluctance, she addressed the
problems with "The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys."</TE>
<TE>   The 932-page book had been under construction for a decade, but
like so many big projects it ended in a "real rush." Goodwin was
writing final passages, while others edited them and a researcher
made last checks of the manuscript against the source material, to
ensure that paraphrases and footnotes were in order.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin said she had read the McTaggart book herself: "I took the
notes. And they were in my longhand. And then, when they got into the
text, that was the mistake."</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't cross-checked," her husband interjected.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't cross-checked," she agreed.</TE>
<TE>   This was the researcher's task?</TE>
<TE>   "I mean again, I don't want to say that," she said. "I mean, that
was her responsibility to cross-check it, but she didn't. But that
doesn't matter. It's mine. I'm the one."</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin made it clear that she was uncomfortable mentioning the
researcher's role. Still, she said, sounding exasperated, it's all
"so crazy ... the fact that that check wasn't made. You know, I mean,
it would have been so simple to either paraphrase these things a
little better or put them in quotes. I mean, it's not like I wouldn't
have wanted to do that."</TE>
<TE>   "So simple," she added. "It would have taken, you know, an hour."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin Denies Intending to Copy Anyone's Work</TE>
<TE>   After the Weekly Standard published the parallel passages
contained in the anonymous letter, along with several more examples
dug up by editorial assistant Bo Crader, Goodwin joined Ambrose front
and center in a lineup of historians accused of plagiarism or other
ethical lapses.</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose, best known for his World War II narratives, was minimal
in his response to the charges, telling the New York Times: "I tell
stories.... I am not writing a Ph.D. dissertation." Goodwin, however,
mounted a more dogged defense, convinced that once she explained
herself, the matter would drop from public view.</TE>
<TE>   "Though my footnotes repeatedly cited Ms. McTaggart's work," she
wrote in Time magazine, "I failed to provide quotation marks for
phrases that I had taken verbatim, having assumed that these phrases,
drawn from my notes, were my words, not hers."</TE>
<TE>   "There is absolutely no intent," she insisted on PBS' "NewsHour,"
"to appropriate anyone else's words as my own, which is what
plagiarism is."</TE>
<TE>   "All that really happened," she told a Boston Globe reporter, "was
she sent me a letter saying not all the passages that relied on her
work had been as fully footnoted as she would have liked. I agreed
with her."</TE>
<TE>   With such comments, Goodwin at times made her dealings with
McTaggart sound almost amicable, a back-and-forth between authors
that might have been conducted on Hallmark cards. In reality, what
McTaggart had lobbed Goodwin's way in 1988 was more like the legal
equivalent of a Scud missile.</TE>
<TE>   Prepared by a powerhouse New York law firm, with dozens of pages
of attachments, the eight-page civil complaint accused Goodwin and
her publishers of "massive and pervasive" copyright infringement,
done in "willful, wanton and in utter disregard" of McTaggart's
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin's book, it hammered on, "slavishly copies not only
McTaggart's words, but also her distinctive style, narrative
structure, and selection, coordination and arrangement of facts and
events....Defendants have copied passages appearing on 91 of the 248
pages of McTaggart's work. At least 45 of the 94 pages in Goodwin's
book that discuss Kathleen Kennedy contain infringing material."</TE>
<TE>   To back this up, side-by-side comparisons of scores of passages
were attached:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hardly a day passed by [went a McTaggart passage] without a
photograph in the papers of little Teddy taking a snapshot with his
Brownie held upside down, or the five Kennedy children lined up on a
train or bus.</TE>
<TE>   Hardly a day passed [reported the Goodwin text] without a
newspaper photograph of little Teddy taking a snapshot with his
camera held upside down, or the five Kennedy children lined up on a
train or on a bus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And so it went, across 30 pages of what was marked "Exhibit A."
Some examples were less persuasive than others. In many instances,
Goodwin indeed had given credit to the McTaggart book in footnotes:
Why would she cite McTaggart's book even once if she intended to
plunder it?</TE>
<TE>   The complaint anticipated this defense: "By including isolated
footnotes to McTaggart's work, Goodwin intentionally and falsely
implies that sections of her work not so footnoted are the product of
her own original research and writing and are not derived from
McTaggart's work."</TE>
<TE>   The complaint was settled before it was ever filed in court:
Footnotes would be added in future printings and language squirted
into the preface, identifying McTaggart's book as "a primary source
for information on Kathleen Kennedy."</TE>
<TE>   In the text itself, however, quotation marks were not placed
around verbatim lifts--apparently because of difficulties this
presented for the printers. McTaggart received what she called a
"substantial" amount of money. A final condition was that the
settlement would remain confidential.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have contended that by not bracketing the language
borrowed from McTaggart in quotation marks, and by keeping the
settlement quiet, plagiarism in a sense was recommitted with every
new copy sold of "The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys." Only after the
matter came to light this year was the book pulled from shelves, to
be mended with appropriate quote marks.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin said she was convinced by lawyers for publisher Simon &amp;
Schuster that it would be simpler to settle, even though "they
thought we actually had a good case." At the time of the settlement,
she already was wading into her research of the Roosevelts.</TE>
<TE>   "No Ordinary Time" would become a bestseller, just like the
Kennedy and Johnson books before it, and be praised by both popular
reviewers and academic historians. At least two distinguished
historians in their reviews could not resist the phrase " 'No
Ordinary Time' is no ordinary book." (Note to the plagiarism police:
These things happen.)</TE>
<TE>   The Roosevelt book emerged just as public television was
broadcasting a Ken Burns baseball documentary that prominently
featured Goodwin. Growing up in Rockville Centre, N.Y., the little
girl known to her neighbors as "Ragmop" had been an avid Brooklyn
Dodgers fan. Later she would transfer her affection to the Boston Red
Sox.</TE>
<TE>   She talked about her baseball memories on the documentary, and on
the book tour her audiences often seemed more interested in hearing
about Jackie Robinson than Eleanor Roosevelt. This prompted her to
write "Wait Till Next Year," a memoir about baseball and coming of
age in suburban New York during the Cold War. Published in 1997, it
was yet another bestseller.</TE>
<TE>   By now, Goodwin was a regular on television, providing historical
perspectives on PBS and NBC throughout the Clinton-Lewinsky mess, the
Bush-Gore electoral standoff and on through to the aftermath of Sept.
11. She had developed a television persona: She was Ragmop all grown
up and educated, hair parted unevenly down the middle, makeup
minimal, her manner warm, wise, accessible. She exhibited a knack for
remembering stories and telling them well.</TE>
<TE>   As her public profile increased, Goodwin did not seem burdened by
the scholarly misstep buried in her past: "It went away from my mind.
It was not as if I were thinking, 'Oh my God, there's this thing I
have done back then that someday will haunt me.' I hardly ever
thought about it again."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, she acted like anything but a historian humbled by a
previous attack on her professional integrity. In 1993, for instance,
she chided author Joe McGinnis for lifting from her Kennedy book: "He
just uses it flat out, without saying that it came from my work." He
denied the charge.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Similarities Between Plagiarists, Kleptomaniacs</TE>
<TE>   Cases where plagiarism is alleged--whether they eventually prove
out or not--tend to unfold along uncannily similar lines. Accused
plagiarists, for example, as Thomas Mallon and others have noted,
often are writers who have not been shy about accusing others of the
offense. And when caught, they almost always fall back first on a
defense of sloppy notetaking.</TE>
<TE>   "Plagiarists," Mallon observed in his 1989 book, "take refuge in
their notebooks with roughly the same frequency that scoundrels wrap
themselves in the flag."</TE>
<TE>   Should the notebook gambit fail, the accused will duck behind his
or her footnotes, protesting that it would be ludicrous to credit a
book and then crib from it; that would be giving the game away.</TE>
<TE>   "As it develops," the late Peter Shaw, an English professor at
Stony Brook University, wrote in a 1982 paper for the academic
journal American Scholar, "giving the game away proves to be the rule
rather than the exception among plagiarists. Both in the commission
of the original act and in the fantastic excuses that follow it,
plagiarism is often calculated above all to result in detection."</TE>
<TE>   Shaw found similarities between plagiarists and kleptomaniacs. The
pattern, he wrote, "begins with the plagiarist's act of stealing
material of the sort that his talent and intelligence would appear to
make unnecessary for him. There follows his strewing of clues to
bring about detection. After detection, the plagiarist offers excuses
that testify to the unconscious motivation of his original act,
though ordinarily without acknowledging either its breach of ethics
or its obvious self-destructiveness."</TE>
<TE>   Recidivism also appears to be part of the package. Plagiarism,
Mallon found, "is something people may do for a variety of reasons
but almost always something they do more than once."</TE>
<TE>   Once allegations about the Kennedy book surfaced, curiosity about
Goodwin's Roosevelt book inevitably was aroused. There were anonymous
e-mails circulated on the Web urging reporters to examine the
Pulitzer Prize-winning book. Goodwin herself put researchers to work
double-checking the book, and a Washington law firm that represented
her pronounced it clean.</TE>
<TE>   For this article, The Times contracted with an outside reader to
select a half-dozen or so of the books listed by Goodwin as source
materials and simply follow the footnotes, randomly reading passages
of "No Ordinary Time" against the other works. The process, which
consumed roughly one full workweek, produced nearly three dozen
instances where phrases and sentences in Goodwin's book resembled the
words of other authors.</TE>
<TE>   To list a few:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grace Tully, "F.D.R.: My Boss":</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the dinner Missy arose from her chair to tell me
she felt ill and very tired. I urged her to excuse herself and go
upstairs to bed but she insisted she would stay until the Boss left.
He did so about 9:30 and within a few minutes Missy suddenly wavered
and fell to the floor unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin:</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the dinner, Grace Tully recalled, Missy arose from
her chair, saying she felt ill and very tired. Tully urged her to

Missy let out a piercing scream, wavered and fell to the floor
unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   Footnote: 242, Missy arose: Grace Tully, "F.D.R.: My Boss"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robert E. Sherwood: "Roosevelt and Hopkins":</TE>
<TE>   At Guantanamo Bay, a large stock of Cuban cigars was purchased. At
Jamaica, St. Lucia and Antigua, the President entertained British
colonial officials and their ladies at lunch. Off Eleuthera Island he
was visited by the Duke of Windsor ...</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin:</TE>
<TE>   At Guantanamo Bay the cruiser pulled into the dock for an hour's
stop so that a large stock of Cuban cigars could be carried on board.

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lillian Rogers Parks, with Frances Spatz Leighton, "The

across from Missy's suite, a distraught nurse was outside her door.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Hugh Gregory Gallagher, "FDR's Splendid Deception":</TE>
<TE>   If, as happened once or twice, one of its members sought to
violate it and try to sneak a picture of the President in his chair,
one or another of the older photographers would "accidentally" knock
the camera to the ground or otherwise block the picture.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin:</TE>
<TE>   If, as occasionally happened, one of the members of the press
corps sought to violate the code by sneaking a picture of the
president looking helpless, one of the older photographers would
"accidentally" block the shot or gently knock the camera to the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   Footnote: 587 "accidentally": Hugh Gregory Gallagher, "FDR's
Splendid Deception."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Given a copy of the complete list, Goodwin gave specific responses
to several of the examples and said that each could be defended. She
added generally that in every instance her footnotes--organized by
page number and anchored to specific phrases contained within a given
paragraph--made clear the original source of the material.</TE>
<TE>   "There are thousands of footnotes in this book," she said, "and
they are really good footnotes."</TE>
<TE>   As for any parallel language reflected in the passages, she said:
"As long as a person is credited," on occasion there is "leeway to
use some of the words. Just using individual words now and then, and
when it is clear where it is coming from, that is what paraphrasing
is." Moreover, she said, in some instances, references to the source
were included in the text.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, she said, "if you had the whole thing quoted, you
would lose the flow of the narrative." In others, the language in
question was simply a common expression--how many ways are there to
describe, say, a "white linen suit" or a camera being knocked "to the
ground"?</TE>
<TE>   And in still others, Goodwin said, sequential action was being
described, and to tamper with the language would be to risk
inaccuracy. She offered as an example of this the similarities
between her description of Roosevelt's Guantanamo Bay visit and that
of Sherwood: "This chronology and structure had to be adhered to in
order to describe the visit accurately. Furthermore, the end-note
anchor phrase of 'At Guantanamo Bay, etc.' clearly alerts the reader
that general information about the Guantanamo Bay is derived from
Sherwood's book."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Goodwin said: "The most important thing I keep coming
back to, and what most people would agree with, is that the standard
to be met in every instance is providing appropriate credit to the
source."</TE>
<TE>   And that, she said, she has done.</TE>
<TE>   There is, as it turns out, less than perfect agreement in the
writerly ranks about what constitutes plagiarism. In response to the
Goodwin and Ambrose matters, historians have bickered about
plagiarism for months now on a Web site called HistoryNewsNetwork
(www.historynewsnetwork.org). Viewpoints range from those who believe
a single stolen word is one too many to those who argue that
originality is a dead concept, that all words and ideas are
derivative.</TE>
<TE>   There are relativity advocates, who hold that it's unfair not to
take into account how many words in a book were not stolen. By such
reasoning, the more conservative types respond, shoplifters might be
given credit for all merchandise they didn't pocket before waltzing
out of the mall.</TE>
<TE>   The American Historical Assn. defines plagiarism as "the
expropriation of another author's text, and the presentation of it as
one's own." In 1990, the association deleted the phrase "with an
intent to deceive" from its definition, depriving plagiarists of
their most common defense.</TE>
<TE>   As for the business of footnotes and quotation marks--that's a
whole subset of debate points. In this regard, the anonymous letter
to the Weekly Standard included a rather helpful guide to the rules
of the road, quoting from the Harbrace College Handbook's eighth
edition:</TE>
<TE>   "Plagiarism is literary theft. When you copy the words of another,
be sure to put those words inside quotation marks and to acknowledge
the source with a footnote. When you paraphrase the words of another,
use your own words and your own sentence structure, and be sure to
give a footnote citing the source of the idea. A plagiarist often
merely changes a few words or rearranges the words in the source. As
you take notes and as you write your paper, be especially careful to
avoid plagiarism. Unless you are quoting directly, avoid entirely the
sentence patterns of the source."</TE>
<TE>   The bold-faced points of emphasis, it should be noted, all were
added by the letter's author, whoever that is.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Public Often Responds With a Collective Yawn</TE>
<TE>   In his American Scholar piece, Shaw described one last piece of
the plagiarism pattern: "After an initial flurry of discussion, most
charges of plagiarism tend to disappear from public view." Sympathy
begins to flow to the plagiarist and away from the plagiarized,
followed by "uneasiness, ambiguity" on the part of those who might
judge the lapsed scholar. Why?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps would-be accusers are wary of pressing too hard out of
fear of inviting similar scrutiny of their own work. Or maybe digging
through the borrowings at some point begins to seem too messy, too
unseemly--the literary equivalent of looking too closely at a freeway
wreck's carnage. Or maybe what Mallon calls "the giggle factor" kicks
in.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody ever has died of improperly lifted passages or substandard
footnotes. Nations do not crumble when their lions of the keyboard
are caught lifting sentences. And although the professoriate might
erupt with indignation, members of the general reading public most
often react to high-profile plagiarism cases with confused shrugs or
sly snickers. Indeed, for many people, the accusations can evoke
empathetic memories of late nights long ago in some cramped college
dorm room, slapping together term papers, full speed ahead and damn
the footnotes.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Goodwin has been seen more and more on television.
PBS might still be gunshy, but she's under contract with NBC and has
turned up on shows hosted by Don Imus, Brian Williams and Katie
Couric, talking about history and baseball and her newest subject,
"old Abe Lincoln."</TE>
<TE>   Despite an early spate of cancellations, Goodwin by her count has
given a dozen speeches since the McTaggart matter arose, and
throughout, she said, the audiences have been with her.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time," she said, "people will say, 'I don't
understand what that was all about'.... I mean, there are so many
other aspects of writing the book.</TE>
<TE>   "The footnotes are one aspect, but do you treat your characters
fairly? Do you analyze the situations correctly? Are you showing
bias? Have you done the kind of research that will bring the
characters to life so that the readers want to read about them?"</TE>
<TE>   In late May, after closed-door wrangling of an undisclosed nature,
Goodwin resigned her seat on the 19-member board that awards Pulitzer
Prizes. In a written statement, she cited both the controversy and
"the need now to concentrate on my Lincoln manuscript."</TE>
<TE>   The board in turn thanked her for her service, and board members
familiar with the matter have declined since to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, this discreet resolution seemed almost predictable:
Before her Harvard-tenure controversy was resolved finally, Goodwin
left and moved on to write the Kennedy book. When trouble arose with
that book, she settled secretly with McTaggart and moved on to
Roosevelt. And now, the Pulitzer business quietly closed, she will
move on to finish her book on old Abe Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll make sure," Goodwin said, "that every single footnote is
absolutely right."</TE>

<HD>Left Bank Proves He Can Go the Distance</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: The 5-year-old scores an impressive victory
over Street Cry and wins the Whitney Handicap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those expecting to see a brilliant performance Saturday in the
$750,000 Whitney Handicap at Saratoga were not disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   Only trouble is it came from something of an unexpected source.</LD>
<LD>   Left Bank, who has made a nice living in races primarily around
one turn, stretched out to nine furlongs and humbled a field in what
was billed as the best race of 2002.</LD>
<TE>   Given a picture ride by John Velasquez, the 5-year-old son of
French Deputy tracked the fast pace of longshot Saint Verre, took
charge with about three-eighths of a mile remaining and won by 1
1/4-lengths over even-money favorite and 123-pound highweight Street
Cry.</TE>
<TE>   Left Bank, who is owned by Michael Tabor and trained by Todd
Pletcher, completed the 1 1/8 miles in 1:47, equaling a track record
set by Tri Jet 28 years ago to the day. He paid $9.20 as the 7-2
fourth choice.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the best group of horses put together all year,"
Pletcher said. "It's good that Saint Verre was in there. The race set
up for everybody and nobody had an excuse. I think the best horse
won."</TE>
<TE>   Regarded as the top handicap horse in the country on the strength
of three consecutive victories to begin the year, including his
impressive wins in the $6 million Dubai World Cup and Stephen Foster
Handicap at Churchill Downs, Street Cry had a perfect trip under
jockey Jerry Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   A runner-up for the sixth time in 12 career starts, the 4-year-old
Machiavellian colt beat defending champion and 7-2 third choice Lido
Palace by a nose. Macho Uno was fourth, then came Unshaded and Saint
Verre.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very disappointed with his race because he had trained so
well coming up to it," said Saeed bin Suroor, Street Cry's trainer.
"The horse just did not look happy. I could tell in the last quarter
of a mile he wasn't going to win.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked OK after the race, but we'll have to see how he comes
out of it before we make a decision about his next start."</TE>
<TE>   This was the 14th victory in 24 starts for Left Bank and it made
him a millionaire. The $450,000 check pushed his earnings to
$1,402,806. It was also his third victory in five starts at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   "If he stays like this, he can go anywhere and beat anyone,"
Velasquez said.</TE>
<TE>   Pletcher said Left Bank will return in the $500,000 Woodward at
Belmont Park on Sept. 7, then possibly go in the Jockey Club Gold Cup
three weeks later before heading to Illinois and the Breeders' Cup
Classic on Oct. 26.</TE>
<TE>   A race earlier, Listen Here, at 8-1, rallied from far off the pace
to beat 18-1 longshot Boston Common and six other 3-year-olds in the
$150,000 Amsterdam.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Kim and Rodney Nardelli and Lewis Lakin and trained by
Bill Mott, Listen Here, a son of Gulch, completed the six furlongs in
1:09 3/5 under jockey Pat Day. The 2 1/4-length victory ended a
six-race losing streak for Listen Here, who had won his first three
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Mayakovsky, the 6-5 favorite making his first start since he
finished fourth in the Santa Anita Derby on April 6, broke slowly
under Bailey, rushed up to battle for the lead, then faded to fourth.
Bold Truth, a 13-1 longshot, finished third in the Grade II.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Little Treasure made a successful U.S. debut, holding off 23-1
longshot Pina Colada to win the $150,000 San Clemente Handicap at Del
Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by a partnership that includes Port Trust, Liberty Road
Stable and San Gabriel Investments and trained by Laura De Seroux,
the 3-year-old Night Shift filly earned her fifth victory in eight
starts. Ridden by Kent Desormeaux, the 5-2 favorite completed the
mile on turf in 1:33 4/5 with a final eighth of a mile in about 11
2/5 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "Laura explained her perfectly to me in the paddock," Desormeaux
said. "I thought she would be like most of the French horses, but she
said if she was in the clear she would be easy to manage.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked her the question fully at the top of the stretch and she
responded. We were smoking the last eighth of a mile."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Takin It Deep, a 10-1 longshot, rallied from well off the pace to
win the $100,000 Joseph T. Grace Handicap at Santa Rosa.</TE>
<TE>   Completing the 1 1/16 miles in 1:42 4/5, the 4-year-old Beau
Genius colt won for the sixth time in 22 starts for owner M.A. Douzos
and trainer Gil Matos. He was ridden by Joey Castro.</TE>
<TE>   Hoovergetthekeys, an 8-1 longshot who had beaten Take It Deep by a
nose to win the Alamedan at Pleasanton, finished second and San
Nicolas, an 18-1 longshot who set a blistering pace while battling
with Mistakenly Special, was able to hold third in the field of nine.</TE>
<TE>   This afternoon at Santa Rosa, the amazing 10-year-old mule Black
Ruby will try for her 46th victory in 52 starts and her ninth in a
row when she runs in the second, a $12,500 allowance at 440 yards.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Although he is already guaranteed $50,000 merely for gracing
Oceanport, N.J., with his presence, trainer Bob Baffert is expected
to add some more cash to his bank account at both Monmouth Park and
Del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   Second to Bobby Frankel among trainers in stable earnings for
2002, Baffert will send out favorites in the $1-million Haskell
Invitational at Monmouth and the $250,000 San Diego Handicap at Del
Mar.</LD>
<LD>   War Emblem, winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness who lost
his chance to make history in the Belmont Stakes after a bad start,
will make his first appearance since that June 8 race against
probably five opponents in the Haskell, which is run at 1 1/8 miles.</LD>
<TE>   Medaglia d'Oro, Peekskill and Easyfromthegitgo were also entered
in the Grade I but are expected to run in the $500,000 Jim Dandy
Stakes, Saratoga's prep for the Aug. 24 Travers.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, Congaree is the 7-5 choice to rebound from his
sixth-place finish in the Stephen Foster Handicap about two months
ago against seven rivals in the San Diego. A Grade II at 1 1/16, the
San Diego is a prep for the $1-million Pacific Classic in three
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Congaree will be making his first start in California since he won
the 2001 Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park. He will be seeking his sixth
win in 11 races and will be refitted with blinkers. Four of his five
wins have come with the hood.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Medaglia d'Oro, last seen running second to
longshot winner Sarava in the Belmont Stakes, will be favored in the
Jim Dandy, a Grade II at 1 1/8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Special Ring. The 5-year-old son of Nureyev ran the
fastest mile ever (1:32 3/5) when winning the Wickerr on Friday. He
is owned by William Preston and trained by Julio Canani. Might he be
another Breeders' Cup Mile winner for Canani, who has already won the
race with Silic and Val Royal?</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Monte Gomes. The trainer, who will send out the
consistently overmatched Chile Bar in today's ninth at Santa Rosa, is
one for 65 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: An exacta box in the third using Ramona Girl,
Stormented and Entrancing.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 5-20. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $30.80/$131.80. Total money bet: $165.</TE>

<LD>New York Athletic Club and Newport Beach Water Polo remained on a
collision course for the championship game of the U.S. Men's Senior
National Water Polo tournament as each team advanced to the
semifinals with pool-play victories Saturday at Corona del Mar High
in Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   New York, the defending champion and winner of three of the last
five tournaments, defeated Sunset Water Polo, 15-7, in the morning,
then cruised to a 6-1 victory over its own B team in the afternoon to
remain unbeaten through three days of play.</LD>
<LD>   Newport, the only other undefeated team in the tournament, got 10
goals in two games from two-meter man Ryan Bailey. The 6-foot-5,
250-pound Bailey scored four times in an 11-4 victory over Golden
Bear Water Polo and had six goals in a 12-4 victory over Malibu.</LD>
<TE>   New York will play Malibu in one semifinal and Newport will play
Stanford Water Polo in the other.</TE>

<LD>For once, the Texas Rangers got a big effort from their bullpen.</LD>
<LD>   Alex Rodriguez hit his major league-leading 37th homer, and Ivan
Rodriguez made up for a key error by scoring the go-ahead run, and
the Rangers rallied to defeat the Boston Red Sox, 8-6, Saturday night
at Arlington, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Texas relievers had a 5.56 earned-run average, 13th in the
American League, but it was the Boston bullpen that faltered.</LD>
<TE>   "We let one get away from us that we shouldn't have," catcher
Jason Varitek said.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Rodriguez's home run was his 278th as a shortstop, breaking a
tie with Ernie Banks and moving into second place on the all-time
list behind Cal Ripken's 345.</TE>
<TE>   Boston's Johnny Damon homered in his third consecutive game. Kevin
Mench hit a three-run homer for the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan Rodriguez's seventh-inning error led to three unearned runs.
But with the score tied, 6-6, he opened the eighth with a double into
the left-field corner against Bob Howry (2-3).</TE>
<TE>   Carl Everett followed with a sacrifice bunt that was fielded by
third baseman Shea Hillenbrand, whose errant throw to first allowed
Rodriguez to score. Everett reached second on the error.</TE>
<TE>   Everett advanced to third on Frank Catalanotto's bunt. Michael
Young, who went three for four, followed with a run-scoring single.</TE>
<TE>   "Our hitters battled back, put up a lot of runs and gave us a
chance to win," Howry said. "We've got to be able to hold the other
team."</TE>
<TE>   Danny Kolb (2-0) pitched 1 1/3 hitless innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Our job is to come in and get guys out," Kolb said. "Our offense
bailed us out a couple of times, then we were able to hold them off."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 8, Detroit 4--Tim Hudson (8-9) rounded back into form with
seven innings of four-hit ball, and Scott Hatteberg had a three-run
double for the Athletics at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Ellis had two triples and Eric Chavez hit his 24th homer for
the A's.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson, who had won twice in his previous seven starts, didn't
give up an earned run until Carlos Pena's two-run homer in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Tejada extended his hitting streak to 23 games, the longest
in the American League this season and third-longest in Oakland
history.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Kansas City 3--Luis Rivas homered with one out in the
10th inning at Minneapolis to lift the Twins in Brad Radke's return
from the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Radke, who was sidelined for two months, struck out a season-high
eight in six innings. He gave up three runs and four hits, and walked
two.</TE>
<TE>   Johan Santana (6-2) combined with three other relievers to pitch
four scoreless innings.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 8, Toronto 4--Travis Driskill won for the first time in
nearly a month, and Chris Singleton homered in his second consecutive
game at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Singleton's two-run homer in the fourth against Chris Carpenter
(4-3) gave the Orioles a 7-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Driskill (7-5) gave up four runs and six hits in seven-plus
innings for his first victory since July 4.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 6, Chicago 2--Paul Wilson won consecutive starts for the
first time in more than a year, and Jason Conti hit a two-run single
during a five-run third inning at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson (4-7) gave up two runs and five hits in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago starter Todd Ritchie (5-15), who leads the majors in
losses, gave up six runs and 10 hits in six innings. He has lost five
consecutive starts, giving up 27 runs and 45 hits in 24 2/3 innings.</TE>

<HD>Martinez Ties Record on the Fly</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Designated hitter has three sacrifice flies in
Mariners' 12-4 victory over Indians to become the 11th player to
accomplish feat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Edgar Martinez wasn't aware that the record he tied even existed.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez matched the major league mark with three sacrifice flies,
and the Seattle Mariners won their sixth consecutive game, defeating
the Cleveland Indians, 12-4, Saturday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew that doesn't happen very often, but I didn't know there
was a record for sacrifice flies," he said. "But it's kind of nice to
have any kind of record."</LD>
<TE>   The Indians lost their fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez became the 11th player to hit three sacrifice flies in a
game and the seventh in the American League.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine that," Seattle Manager Lou Piniella said. "As long as
this game has been played, only 11 players have done that. That
astounded me."</TE>
<TE>   John Olerud went four for five, including his 18th homer, and had
four runs batted in. Ichiro Suzuki had his first multihit game since
July 25 for the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland's Ellis Burks homered against Ryan Franklin in the
eighth to set a major league record with homers at 41 major league
ballparks. It was his 24th homer this season.</TE>
<TE>   Burks, 37, homered at Safeco Field in the first game of the AL
division series Oct. 9, a 5-0 victory by Cleveland, but that didn't
count toward the record.</TE>
<TE>   Freddy Garcia (12-7) got his first victory since June 29, a span
of five games. He gave up two runs and four hits in seven innings,
and struck out four.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners jumped on Jaret Wright (0-2) for a 7-2 lead in the
first two innings.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In his rookie season last year, shortstop David Eckstein set a
franchise record when he was hit by a pitch 21 times. He'll match
that record the next time a pitcher hits him.</LD>
<LD>   Although players commonly talk about improving in a particular
statistical category from year to year--hitting one more home run,
stealing one more base, winning or saving one more game--Eckstein
insists he is not intent on improving his hit-by-pitch total.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't look to increase that, because with one pitch in a bad
spot I could be done," he said. "I won't say I want to get hit 30
times this season. Where I stand in the batter's box, I'm going to
get hit. But, if I go up there looking to get hit, I'm not
aggressive, and that's something I don't want to be."</LD>
<TE>   And there's another reason he won't say he wants to get hit more
often.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom would hate it," he said. "She says, 'I hate it when you
get hit.' "</TE>
<TE>   As a leadoff batter, he said, he does look to improve his on-base
percentage, .355 last season and .360 before Saturday's game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels signed center fielder Darin Erstad to a four-year,
$32-million contract extension Saturday, no teammate was happier than
pitcher Jarrod Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   "That's huge for the team," Washburn said. "As a fly-ball pitcher,
it's even more huge. The guy takes away two or three hits a game for
me."</TE>

<LD>Quick and decisive has never been a baseball theme, but credit needs
to be given where it is due:</LD>
<LD>   * Commissioner Bud Selig acted quickly, punitively and correctly
in fining Cincinnati General Manager Jim Bowden a reported
$50,000--which sources in Ohio insisted the club will not pay on his
behalf--for exhibiting that Riverfront malady known as Marge Schott
Mouth.</LD>
<LD>   Bowden has been imaginative and resourceful in keeping the
revenue-restricted Reds in contention during his 10 years as GM, but
his honesty and credibility have been hammered by former coaches and
players, and he has a tendency to talk without thinking, as
illustrated again by the callous and insensitive remarks that drew
Selig's wrath.</LD>
<TE>   Bowden apologized, but speculation continued throughout baseball
Saturday about his job status.</TE>
<TE>   "If Al Campanis can be</TE>
<TE>   fired ..." said longtime Reds' broadcaster Joe Nuxhall, a
reference to the Dodgers' dismissal of their former general manager
for his infamous and insensitive remarks about African Americans on
the television show "Nightline."</TE>
<TE>   Bowden said that if the players are dumb enough to strike they
ought to pick Sept. 11 as a symbolic date and "let [union leader]
Donald Fehr drive the plane right into the building."</TE>
<TE>   No one could be so mindless as to not realize the firestorm those
remarks would create, but then it fits a pattern of embarrassing
incidents too long to chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   It is enough, perhaps, to recall that mild-mannered Jeff Shaw,
claiming Bowden violated a handshake agreement not to trade him when
he was dealt to the Dodgers, said, "If I had been in a room with him,
I would have killed him"; that former coach Ron Oester, believing
Bowden had misled him and maneuvered him out of a chance to manage
the team, called him "one of the worst people in the world," and that
infielder Pokey Reese, still with the team last year and contending
Bowden had maliciously spread a rumor that he and Sean Casey had
turned down contract offers, said, "All Jim Bowden has to do is open
his mouth and you know he's lying."</TE>
<TE>   * Ralph Nelson, baseball's vice president of umpiring, acted with
similar quickness and correctness in 1) recommending to dean of
discipline Bob Watson that he not fine or suspend Dodger closer Eric
Gagne and 2) acknowledging that umpire Dan Iassogna had misread the
situation in which he concluded that Gagne had intentionally hit
Cincinnati's Adam Dunn with a pitch and ejected the pitcher from a
game the Dodgers lost, 6-4, in 13 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Although Iassogna is not on the full-time staff, he has umpired
more than 400 major league games and is widely respected for his
ball-and-strike work. The rule, however, forces every umpire to put
himself in the pitcher's head in determining intent, and Iassogna had
earlier been reprimanded for not doing enough in a May 5 game between
Boston and Tampa Bay in which three players were hit by pitches.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't do enough that time and overreacted this time. Hard to
have it both ways. The rule needs to be addressed.</TE>
<TE>   * Bill Stoneman, the Angels' general manager, also made a quick
and wise decision in extending Darin Erstad's contract for four
years. Erstad was eligible for free agency, and the issue might have
become a distraction down the stretch. Erstad may never totally
recapture his .355, 240-hit form of two years ago, but he sets the
aggressive tone and is clearly the leader--whether it's with a
whisper and an arm around Ramon Ortiz on the day following a tough
loss or with a more biting comment in a team meeting. The former
Nebraska punter has become the Anaheim quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   A Sheff Shot?</TE>
<TE>   Gary Sheffield could have had the Dodgers and their pre-deadline
trades in mind when he reflected on the Atlanta Braves' decision to
stand pat and said:</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a great position. Put us in a [postseason] series and
all we have to do is be ourselves. Me, Chipper [Jones], Andruw
[Jones], the meat of our order. That's what it takes, three guys to
come together. When it really counts is in the playoffs. We're not
looking at it like a lot of these teams making moves to try to reach
the playoffs, win a wild card. Our goal is to win the World Series."</TE>
<TE>   Said GM John Schuerholz: "We didn't think there's a piece missing.
In fact, it might have been more damaging to chemistry to have added
a piece."</TE>
<TE>   Going Off</TE>
<TE>   Former Boston general manager Dan Duquette stunned peers (and
certainly former Dodger manager Tom Lasorda) with his four-year,
$26-million signing of Jose Offerman in 1999, ostensibly to replace
Mo Vaughn. What ensued was that the defensively deficient and
offensively inconsistent Offerman often seemed to think he was owed
even more than his bimonthly paychecks. The situation that led to his
release and ensuing tirade at reporters and interim General Manager
Mike Port, the final straw in a series of straws, came Monday night
in Anaheim when he refused to pinch-run in the ninth inning of a loss
to the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Said Port, talking about Offerman's four-year decline: "That is
somewhat the risk of multiyear contracts. It's going to go one of two
ways. Either a guy is going to be appreciative of and comfortable
with the security and go out and play with abandon, or he will take a
downturn in performance."</TE>
<TE>   Port didn't have to specify the course that Offerman took.</TE>
<TE>   Not Encouraging</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the fact that he has been on the disabled list 11
times since 1994, new Dodger reliever Paul Shuey says, "I'm not the
most genetically sound pitcher."</TE>
<TE>   Oh well, he's owed only $6.5 million over the next two years.</TE>

<HD>Hoosier Hysteria</HD>
<DH>Stunning growth of Brickyard 400 has been an awakening for
grand, old track</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ED HINTON</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>A decade ago this summer, Indianapolis Motor Speedway President Tony
George was a man in a quandary over this NASCAR business.</LD>
<LD>   He wasn't sure whether to accept a proposal for the grandest
wedding in modern-day motor sports--of America's most popular form of
racing to America's most-hallowed track.</LD>
<LD>   George feared this would be a Hollywood marriage, glitzy but
brief.</LD>
<TE>   "Those NASCAR fans," he said, "are accustomed to being able to see
all the way around their race tracks."</TE>
<TE>   Indy's mammoth grandstands would be their own obstacle to
continuing sellouts of a NASCAR event, he thought.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I think they'll come to our place once," he said. "But when
they realize they can't see the whole track, they may not come back."</TE>
<TE>   Well, now ... they're back. Again. More than 300,000 strong, as
always.</TE>
<TE>   Today's Brickyard 400 will be the ninth running of the most
immediately and enormously successful event in the history of motor
sports. No other race has become so big so fast.</TE>
<TE>   The fans can't see much, except for hordes of one another. Even if
they could, there wouldn't be much racing--in the NASCAR sense,
door-to-door--to see.</TE>
<TE>   Running big, clumsy stock cars at Indy is like stampeding a herd
of buffalo down a waxed hardwood hallway. They slip, slide and lumber
through the flat, sharp, treacherous turns of an ancient
"oval"--actually a rectangle--built in 1909 for cars that ran 70 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Many generations of Indy cars have evolved, designed specifically
to go fast on the old Speedway, with all other tracks merely
afterthoughts.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR brings its standard equipment. And so primitive cars plus
primitive track configuration add up to dull and tentative racing
with little passing.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't matter. Indy is the towering paradox of the Winston Cup
tour--arguably the worst track for NASCAR-style racing but clearly
the best venue. No other Cup race comes close to the Brickyard in
attendance.</TE>
<TE>   And even as the oldest track by far on the tour, Indy is in many
ways the most modern--today's race will be the first Winston Cup
event ever run with life-saving "soft walls," first used for this
year's Indy 500, which George has spent years and millions of dollars
developing.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, the Brickyard 400 is worship, instant tradition,
McReverence, steeped and seasoned and microwaved in the armies of
motor homes that invade central Indiana the first weekend of each
August.</TE>
<TE>   The NASCAR legions have taken racing's most hallowed ground for
their own, all those decades of very different tradition at Indy be
damned--or rather, just ignored.</TE>
<TE>   It all amounts to a phenomenon no one could have forecast. Not
even George, who in 1992, his third year as head of the Speedway, had
such revolutionary ideas for the place that many deemed him either a
dreamer or just not very smart.</TE>
<TE>   The place where he expressed his concerns was in itself telling of
the tradition-shattering options he was weighing. It was in the
paddock at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal, where he was the VIP
guest of yet another suitor of the Speedway, Formula One.</TE>
<TE>   His flirtations with NASCAR and F1 had outraged purists who held
"The 500-Mile Race," known to the world as the Indy 500, to be
sacrosanct. It must, they felt, be the only event here each year, as
it had been since 1911.</TE>
<TE>   George wasn't bothered by the charges of heresy, bent as he was on
awakening the grand, old track from stodgy tradition. From the day in
1990 when he ascended the throne of his grandfather, the late Anton
Hulman, George clearly meant to run Indy as a business, and a growing
one at that.</TE>
<TE>   But on NASCAR, he moved cautiously. The last thing he wanted was a
novelty event that would flash but once, then ebb.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of '92 he agreed to a sort of first date with
NASCAR. It was billed as "a tire test" for Winston Cup cars but
amounted to a dress rehearsal. Everybody who was anybody in NASCAR
came. When they got here, they knelt and bowed and kissed the storied
"yard of bricks" at the start-finish line.</TE>
<TE>   America's race fans took that as the engagement of the titanic
couple, though it was by no means official, and prepared to pounce on
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   All seats were gone within hours after ticket sales opened. Then
the backlog of demand blew out Indy's computerized ticketing system.
All of this occurred in 17 hours.</TE>
<TE>   And the Brickyard 400 has been sold out ever since.</TE>
<TE>   When CART pulled out of the 500 in '96, claiming to take the
"stars and cars" with it, even local sports pundits laughed. The
league with all the stars and cars was NASCAR, and so the 400 leapt
over the 500, at least in the hearts and minds of locals who
preferred the all-American cast to the imported personalities of the
500.</TE>
<TE>   A Brickyard 400 weekend is now what an Indy 500 weekend used to
be--a Woodstock with grandstands. Venture too near the corner of 16th
Street and Georgetown Road by Friday afternoon, and you risk being
hopelessly lost in gridlock, not only of traffic but of pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   Yet anybody in the service industry in Indianapolis will tell you
they'd rather host the NASCAR crowd--which is better behaved--than
the rowdy 500 throngs.</TE>
<TE>   This is yet another paradox, for in the 400's beginnings, Indy
officials, fearful of NASCAR fans' reputation for hooliganism in the
South, decided not to open the infield for general admission and RV
parking. They still don't.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, the 400 might easily outdraw the 500, and what is
annually one of the dullest races in NASCAR might become the biggest
race in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The venerable TV racing commentator Chris Economaki, when he was a
track public-address announcer, had his own rule for creating
excitement: "The crowd must never leave having seen a race that was
as good as it thinks it saw."</TE>
<TE>   The Brickyard 400 may be racing's best example of Economaki's Law,
plus a current political catch phrase: Perception is reality.</TE>

<LD>With hog-calling and pigs' feet-eating contests between innings, the
minor league Fort Worth Cats recently staged "You Might Be a Redneck
Night."</LD>
<LD>   The ballpark promotion seemingly was a hit with everyone except
the Cats' opponent, the Jackson (Miss.) Senators, who became offended
when the public-address announcer informed the crowd that it's a good
clue you're a redneck if you:</LD>
<LD>   "Manage the Jackson Senators; Play for the Jackson Senators; Live
in Jackson, Miss.; All of the above."</LD>
<TE>   With the sound of cowbells saluting them as they stepped into the
batter's box, the irate Senators promptly scored six runs in the
first three innings.</TE>
<TE>   Unfazed, the Cats' promotions department has plans for a "Labor
Stoppage Night" in the event of a major league players' strike.
Pregnant fans will be admitted free.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who batted .400 in World Series play a record three
times?</TE>
<TE>   Shoe wars: LeBron James, who some NBA scouts say could become the
greatest basketball player since Michael Jordan, has triggered fierce
competition between shoe companies trying to sign the 17-year-old
Ohio prep star to an endorsement contract.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of the James sweepstakes will be "whoever comes to the
table with the best offer," James told the Bloomberg News Service. He
chuckled when asked if $5 million would be inducement enough. "I hear
that number, and it makes me smile," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dwight place, Dwight time: A motorist pulled over to help Cydney
Springer and Lindsey Ditsworth recently when their vehicle stalled in
Denver, according to Rocky Mountain News columnist Sam Adams.</TE>
<TE>   After the motorist's failed attempt to jump their battery with
cables, he offered Springer and Ditsworth use of his rental car so
they could make an appointment. The women decided to take the
motorist up on his offer, and when they returned 90 minutes later,
the stranger had purchased and installed a new battery.</TE>
<TE>   All he asked in return is that they cheer for No. 85 of the San
Diego Chargers when they play the Broncos on Oct. 6 in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   No. 85 is receiver and return specialist Tim Dwight, who just
happened to be vacationing in Denver at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Simple plan: Sean Keeler of the Des Moines (Iowa) Register
suggests two ways the Big Ten Conference can improve its football
profile:</TE>
<TE>   "1. Have your teams schedule at least one traditional leader or
contender from a power conference. 2. Beat them.</TE>
<TE>   "There. Was that so hard?"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Eddie Collins, in 1910 and 1913 with the
Philadelphia Athletics and in 1917 with the Chicago White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Television commentator Lee Corso, as usual, didn't
hold back when he addressed the problems facing the Southeastern
Conference at a college football kickoff luncheon in Atlanta. Two SEC
schools, Alabama and Kentucky, are on probation and three others,
Tennessee, Louisiana State and Mississippi State, are being
investigated for possible violations.</TE>
<TE>   "The national view is, the SEC cheats," Corso said. "Everybody's a
bunch of cheaters, a bunch of crooks. The SEC's got a public
relations problem. They better show they've got more than that."</TE>

Jose State's football team was picked to finish eighth in the Western
Athletic Conference, but that's not so bad. Last season's champ,
Louisiana Tech, was picked to finish ninth."</TE>
<TE>   Don't bet on it: A spokesman for the Phoenix Coyotes denied a
report in the Chicago Tribune  stating that Wayne Gretzky, 41, a
minority owner with the Coyotes, has been preparing for a possible
return to the NHL as a player.</TE>
<TE>   "Wayne's been skating and playing pickup games this summer, but
that's just to help him stay and shape and feel better," Rich Nairn
told the Bloomberg News Service.</TE>
<TE>   A return to playing could be risky for Gretzky, who has two

<LD>Kevin Brown took another big step Saturday toward joining the
Dodgers' playoff push, pitching effectively in his first
rehabilitation start for triple-A Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, continuing to exceed expectations in recovering from June
11 surgery for a herniated disk in his lower back, worked 3 2/3
innings for the 51s against Memphis at Las Vegas, giving up one hit,
one run and walking two with three strikeouts in a 50-pitch
performance. He is expected to make one more rehabilitation start
before being activated from the disabled list.</LD>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Beltre Looking to Earn His Keep in Second Half</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Third baseman Adrian Beltre believes his best work is ahead of him,
and he hopes the Dodgers still do too.</LD>
<LD>   Beltre has been the club's top run producer since the All-Star
break, batting .291 with six home runs and 20 runs batted in. He has
more homers and RBIs than Shawn Green, Brian Jordan and Eric Karros
combined during that stretch, and has also shined defensively.</LD>
<LD>   Beltre acknowledges he disappointed in the first half, batting
only .238 with seven homers and 29 RBIs, but he's not part of the
problem now.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not how you start--it's how you finish," said Beltre, who
had a run-scoring single in Saturday's 8-6, 12-inning victory over
the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans Stadium. "I was struggling in
the first half, but I had to put that behind me."</TE>
<TE>   Beltre said he changed his approach at the plate after the break,
relying on his hands more, and less on upper-body motion, to drive
the ball. He has also made a major change off the field, recently
becoming engaged.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being frustrated with Beltre, the Dodgers declined to
include him in potential trades before the non-waiver deadline.
Executives from other teams said it would be risky for the Dodgers to
give up on Beltre, 23, but he knows the club's patience is running
thin.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be out of here, and that was one of the things
that hit me [before the deadline]," he said. "I said to myself, 'I
better start doing better, because I don't want to be [traded].' I
gave them a reason to think about trading me because I wasn't
[playing well]. I don't want to give them that reason again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alex Cora started at shortstop Saturday and continued to deliver
in an impressive season, getting a run-scoring double.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy plans to use Cora more down the stretch, cutting
into the playing time of middle infielders Cesar Izturis and Mark
Grudzielanek. The Dodgers are still pleased with the smooth-fielding
Izturis despite his problems at the plate, but they need production.</TE>
<TE>   "I've said it since spring training, that Cesar Izturis is here to
continue to develop offensively," Tracy said. "Defensively, we felt,
and still feel, he's off the charts. But it's not May, it's August,
with [52] games to play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fox-TV reported Saturday that the Dodgers discussed team problems
in a players-only meeting before the game. But they actually met to
empower player representative Paul Lo Duca to act on their behalf in
upcoming labor matters.</TE>

<HD>Erstad's Deal Seen as Message</HD>
<DH>Angels: Outfielder's new contract means management is
serious about keeping team together, players say, even though it
strains payroll.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels are scheduled to pay 10 players as much next season as
they paid their entire roster this season. The Angels' ability to
field another contender next year might well depend upon Disney's
willingness to increase the player payroll at the risk of absorbing
another huge financial loss.</LD>
<LD>   After announcing a four-year, $32-million contract extension for
center fielder Darin Erstad on Saturday, General Manager Bill
Stoneman said he does not expect to have to trade any of his core
players to lower the Angels' payroll.</LD>
<LD>   "Our plan is to hang on to what we've got, otherwise why would we
do it?" Stoneman said. "My boss is certainly aware of the numbers,
and he's just fine with it."</LD>
<TE>   Angel President Paul Pressler last winter approved a payroll boost
to a club-record $60 million. With the signing of Erstad, the Angels
now have committed that amount next season to Erstad, outfielders
Garret Anderson and Tim Salmon, third baseman Troy Glaus, catcher
Bengie Molina and pitchers Kevin Appier, Ramon Ortiz, Troy Percival,
Aaron Sele and Jarrod Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Washburn, all of those players are signed through at
least 2004. Washburn is eligible for salary arbitration after this
season but is not eligible for free agency for another three years.</TE>
<TE>   He was thrilled that the Angels rewarded Erstad, the team leader,
before he could file for free agency this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it sends a great message, that this isn't just a one-year
thing," Washburn said. "We're a great team now, and they want to keep
us a great team."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels probably cannot afford to retain both first baseman
Scott Spiezio and designated hitter Brad Fullmer, but the option is
theirs. Second baseman Adam Kennedy also is eligible for arbitration,
and the Angels can pay shortstop David Eckstein and pitcher John
Lackey whatever they like above the major league minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   Disney is trying to sell the team and, sources said, is
anticipating a loss in the range of $15 million to $20 million this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Angels signed Erstad, 28, to a deal that ranks as
third-highest in franchise history. In 1998, the Angels signed
free-agent first baseman Mo Vaughn to an $80-million contract, over
six years. Last year, they signed Salmon to a $40-million extension,
over four years.</TE>
<TE>   While Erstad's statistics are not spectacular--he is hitting .283
with seven home runs--Angel teammates and management said his speed,
defensive prowess and leadership more than justified the average
$8-million salary of the new deal. He was a finalist for the American
League All-Star team this season.</TE>
<TE>   An executive from another AL club and an agent who does not
represent Erstad each said he might have commanded as much as $10
million per season in free agency.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care," Erstad said. "I want to be here and I wanted to
get it done so I don't have to answer questions about it the next two
months and can focus on getting to the playoffs."</TE>

<HD>Barlow Leads Fast Company</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moments after seizing the third-round lead in The International on
Saturday, Craig Barlow could already hear the footsteps.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Brooks, Sergio Garcia, Greg Norman and British Open champion
Ernie Els were among the heavy hitters poised to catch the unheralded
Barlow in today's final round at Castle Rock, Colo. And he knew it.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes, those guys have great records and they are big names,"
Barlow said. "But I've got to worry about me, not them."</LD>
<TE>   Barlow birdied the last three holes to inch ahead of Steve Lowery
and set up an intriguing showdown.</TE>
<TE>   Barlow's short birdie putt on the 18th hole gave him 11 points for
the round and 28 points for the tournament under the modified
Stableford scoring system.</TE>
<TE>   Moments earlier, Lowery, playing in the same group, also birdied
No. 18 to go to 27.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks was at 26 and Rich Beem 25. Garcia stood at 21.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia made the most noise in the third round, carding an eagle
and eight birdies to storm the leaderboard. He moved momentarily into
first place and found himself in fifth by the end of the day.</TE>
<TE>   The scoring system awards five points for eagle, two for birdie,
zero for par, minus-one for bogey and minus-three for double bogey or
worse.</TE>
<TE>   The field was cut again to the top 36 players and ties for today's
final round at Castle Pines Golf Club.</TE>
<TE>   Players enjoyed favorable weather conditions after battling winds
that gusted as high as 40 mph during the first two rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia's 19 points represented the best round of the day--just one
off the tournament record. Norman and Steve Stricker each had
16-point rounds, and Beem had 15.</TE>
<TE>   Norman and Stricker had 20-point totals, along with Els. Ian
Leggatt and Geoff Ogilvy stood at 18.</TE>
<TE>   Barlow, 199th on the money list and in need of a good finish to
avoid losing his Tour card for the third time in five years, birdied
five of his last six holes to move from plus-18 to plus-28.</TE>
<TE>   Lowery, the second-round leader with 21 points, faltered early but
made four birdies on his back nine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seeking her second win in Ohio in three weeks, South Korea's Mi
Hyun Kim shot a five-under-par 65 to forge a three-stroke lead
heading into the final round of the Wendy's Championship for Children
in Dublin.</TE>
<TE>   Kim won the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic two weeks ago in Youngstown,
Ohio, for her fourth victory in as many years on tour.</TE>
<TE>   Kim's bogey-free 67 left her at nine-under 135.</TE>
<TE>   She will try to preserve a lead heading into the final round for
the first time since blowing a five-shot lead at Rochester six weeks
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Ammaccapane, who followed a first-round 73 with a 65, was
alone in second at 138. She started the day tied for 37th and eight
shots back but made up ground with seven birdies in a bogey-free
round.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hale Irwin and Hubert Green were tied for the lead after two
rounds of the Long Island Classic at Jericho, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin, the first-round leader by one stroke, shot a four-under-par
67 and was at 11-under 131 along with Green, who matched Irwin's
opening-round 64.</TE>
<TE>   Morris Hatalsky, who had a second-round 65, was the only other
player to reach 10 under.</TE>

<HD>Hail to the Chief of the Redskins</HD>
<DH>Football: Many from 'Over the Hill Gang' teams of 1970s
turn out to see Allen inducted posthumously into Hall of Fame. Deacon
Jones presents him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEONARD SHAPIRO</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>CANTON, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Hail, hail, the now-Way Over the Hill Gang was mostly all here
Saturday to witness the induction ceremony for George Allen, the
Washington Redskins' and Los Angeles Rams' quirky, consumed and
singularly focused former head coach.</LD>
<LD>   Allen was enshrined posthumously in the Pro Football Hall of Fame
on a steamy afternoon that his son, echoing his late father,
described as "a great day to be alive."</LD>
<LD>   Close to 18,000 streamed into Fawcett Stadium just behind the Hall
to hear Sen. George Allen (R-Va.) accept the game's ultimate honor
for his father, who died of a heart attack in 1990 at 72. Allen never
had a losing season in 14 years as a professional head coach and
dramatically changed the Redskins' fortunes during his tenure from
1971 to '77, including the first Super Bowl team in 1972.</LD>
<TE>   Billy Kilmer, the still furnace-faced quarterback of that
memorable era, was here, and so was John Riggins, celebrating the
10th anniversary of his own induction in the Hall in 1992 and back
for the first time since he was enshrined.</TE>
<TE>   Redskin Hall of Famers Bobby Mitchell, Charley Taylor and Ken
Houston were here, among more than 30 former Allen players and
coaches from the Rams and Redskins, including Jack Pardee, Marv Levy,
Ted Marchibroda, Ray Schoenke, Merlin Olsen, Brig Owens, John Wilber,
Mark Moseley, Eddie Brown, Bob Kuziel, Dan Ryczek, Dallas Hickman and
Mike Bragg.</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty of cheering during the ceremony, not only for
Allen, but for four other inductees.</TE>
<TE>   Former Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly drew the loudest, mainly
because he invited 1,200 of his closest friends, many wearing his
Bill jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Also warmly received were Oakland tight end Dave "The Ghost"
Casper, introduced by John Madden; Pittsburgh wide receiver John
Stallworth, presented by his son, John Jr., and Chicago defensive
lineman Dan Hampton, presented by former Bear Ed O'Bradovich.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly was introduced by his coach, former Allen special teams
coach Levy.</TE>
<TE>   The emotional highlight came at the end of Kelly's 17-minute
speech, when he spoke about his 5-year-old son Hunter, diagnosed at
four months with Krabbes Disease, a fatal, inherited degenerative
disorder of the central and peripheral nervous system.</TE>
<TE>   The child was not expected to live past 2 and requires 24-hour
care, and Kelly said, "I've prayed every day of my life that he would
be here today. God has granted me that blessing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been said all throughout my career that toughness was my
trademark. The toughest person I've ever met in my life is my hero,
my soldier, my son, Hunter."</TE>
<TE>   None of the inductees broke down on the podium, although the voice
of the usually stoic Casper wavered.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 10 years old in Elgin [Illinois] when I saw some kids
playing football," Casper said. "My mom asked, 'Why didn't you go
play with them?'</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think they wanted me to," Casper responded, praising his
mother, Dorothy, for encouraging him.</TE>
<TE>   Deacon Jones, who played for Allen on the Rams and for a season in
Washington at the end of his career, introduced his old coach with a
passionately delivered oration.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said Allen's success was based on "teamwork, hard work and
competitive spirit.... He was the ultimate player's coach.... I've
been waiting for this for a long time.... He taught us the harder we
worked, the luckier we got, and boy did we get lucky."</TE>

<LD>Although she has been second more than twice as often as she has won,
Big On Charm has made herself a nice living.</LD>
<LD>   A 5-year-old California-bred mare owned and bred by Double Bar S
Ranch and trained by W.G. Baber, Big On Charm has earned more than
$227,000 in her 31-race career. She'll try to add to her bankroll
when she makes her first start of 2002 in tonight's eighth, a $12,250
allowance at 350 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Idle since Nov. 23, the daughter of Sir Alibi has won six times
but has been runner-up on 13 occasions. One of her seconds came
against Corona Kool in the Charger Bar Handicap on Jan. 19, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Joe Badilla Jr., the last jockey to have won with the mare (last
Aug. 25), takes the call and she will break from post two in the
field of five. Rounding out the lineup are Proudest Goddess, Imjumpn,
Blushing Lady Bug and Blue Grass Bounce.</TE>
<TE>   Proudest Goddess, who will leave from the inside post, is the only
member of the field with a win this year.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. A Dash Of Apollo. 2. Cee Miss Tizzy. 3. A Red Hot
Star. 4. Frisco Country. 5. Shenoshezroyal. 6. Icey Gambler. 7. Spit
Happens. 8. Big On Charm. 9. Baby Got Bac.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use A Dash Of Apollo, Traffic Attraction and Daring
Intention in the first, single Cee Me Tizzy in the second, use A Red
Hot Star and Dashin Mystery Man in the third and BCR Grab The Cash,
Frisco Country and Amender in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Californias Chick is a new face from Idaho in
the fifth who gets a top rider in Alex Bautista. Randi's Man is a win
type (15 for 37) making his first start of 2002 in the sixth.</TE>

<HD>Show Goes On, but Not Game</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Lightning causes first half of All-Star game to be
shortened so pop singer can perform. MLS squad beats U.S. national
team, 3-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Well, they got the halftime show in.</LD>
<LD>   After a lightning storm caused a nearly one-hour delay, Major
League Soccer eliminated the final 15 minutes of the first half of
its All-Star game on Saturday for a concert by pop singer Paulina
Rubio.</LD>
<LD>   "They could have nixed Paulina to play 10 more minutes of soccer,"
Dallas forward Jason Kreis said.</LD>
<TE>   Just weeks after baseball couldn't produce a winner in its
All-Star game because it ran short of players after 11 innings,
soccer produced an unusually abbreviated game, with the MLS All-Stars
beating the U.S. national team, 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   The game's title sponsor was conspicuous during the halftime
show--its logo was pasted across two inflatable bottles, the stage in
the middle of the field and the headbands of dancers.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt it was the right decision to make on what we were trying
to deliver to our television audience and what we were trying to
deliver to our audience in the stands," MLS Commissioner Don Garber
said.</TE>
<TE>   It used to be that all baseball games had a winner or loser unless
stopped by rain or darkness, and that all soccer games went at least
90 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But that is no longer the case.</TE>
<TE>   Garber said the decision to cut one-sixth of the game was his, and
that ABC didn't make the call. After broadcasting the halftime show,
ABC dropped coverage of the game at 6 p.m. EDT, with the score, 1-1,
in the 26th minute of the second half, to return to local
programming.</TE>
<TE>   Coverage switched to the cable network ESPN, which like ABC is a
subsidiary of The Walt Disney Co., and one minute later, game MVP
Marco Etcheverry scored for the MLS All-Stars.</TE>
<TE>   During regular-season play, the Bolivian has scored only one
league goal in the last 1 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   In a year when soccer fans worried about the rainy season in Japan
and South Korea during the World Cup, the biggest weather story
happened at RFK Stadium in the U.S. capital.</TE>
<TE>   Rain began to fall in the 12th minute and the game was halted
because of lightning eight minutes later by Brian Hall, the American
referee who worked at the World Cup. The 20 minutes were the longest
scoreless stretch in the seven All-Star games staged by the young
league.</TE>
<TE>   During the delay, visibility was down to about 100 yards. Despite
warnings to take cover, about a dozen fans ran out on the field, and
one was led off in handcuffs after he mooned the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 members of Sam's Army, the U.S. fan group, stayed by
their seats, singing and dancing despite announcements to take cover
in the stadium concourse.</TE>
<TE>   When the game resumed, the turf was so soggy that passes along the
ground quickly rolled to a stop. Still, it produced five goals and
far more entertaining soccer than during the first half, when the
turf was so slick players had trouble controlling the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to do anything to disappoint the fans who went out
and spent their hard-earned money," said Landon Donovan, who scored
twice for the U.S. team during the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of the 11 U.S. starters were on the World Cup roster, but the
Americans were missing 12 of the Europe-based players, who are
preparing for the start of their club seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Also missing was injured forward Clint Mathis.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan, who scored four goals during last year's All-Star game
and at 20 was the youngest scorer at the World Cup, put the Americans
ahead 12 minutes into the second half, but Kreis tied it a minute
later.</TE>
<TE>   After the goal by Etcheverry, the United States tied it, 2-2, when
Cobi Jones scored in the 31st minute of the second half. Steve
Ralston scored the game-winner five minutes later off a backheel pass
from Kreis.</TE>

<HD>Stewart Fires Back After Taking Pole</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Stewart blistered Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Saturday to win
the pole for today's Brickyard 400, then blistered all other NASCAR
tracks for "dragging their feet on soft wall installation."</LD>
<LD>   Praising Indy for its life-saving new energy-dissipating walls,
Stewart rejected NASCAR's and the other tracks' claims that more
testing is needed before the system goes into widespread use.</LD>
<LD>   "Whether the testing was done adequately, I don't care," he said.
"It can't be any worse than hitting a solid concrete wall. I don't
know how it could possibly hurt us any more than a concrete wall
already does."</LD>
<TE>   After observing how effective the new barriers were for the
Indianapolis 500 in May--scientists believe as many as five drivers
were saved from grave injuries in Indy car crashes--NASCAR agreed to
let the system stay in place, with a few adjustments, for today's
race. This will be the first Winston Cup event run with soft
retaining walls.</TE>
<TE>   New Hampshire International Speedway officials had planned to
install the system for the July 21 New England 300 but said NASCAR
had asked them to hold off. NASCAR-hired experts said modifications
to Indy's system are needed because stock cars are twice as heavy as
Indy cars, and because of the wide variety of shapes and sizes of
tracks.</TE>
<TE>   At Indianapolis on Saturday, Stewart had a qualifying run of
182.960 mph in a Pontiac, a track record for stock cars.</TE>

<TE>   Tony Bruncati won the seventh stage of the Miller Lite Big Ten

<LD>Steve Spurrier's first NFL exhibition game had a Florida-type result.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington Redskins threw early and often and won by more than
four touchdowns, just as Spurrier's Fun 'N Gun Gators used to do, in
a 38-7 victory over the San Francisco 49ers in the American Bowl
today (Saturday night PDT) in the Osaka Dome at Japan.</LD>
<LD>   The Redskins passed for five touchdowns, threw 45 times and ran
only 21 times. Spurrier even went long on fourth and one, with Danny
Wuerffel tossing a 31-yard touchdown pass over the middle to Derrius
Thompson.</LD>
<TE>   Sage Rosenfels threw touchdown passes of 65 yards to Thompson and
10 yards to rookie Robert Royal in the second quarter. Rosenfels, a
second-year player who didn't get into a regular-season game last
year, played the first half and completed 10 of 20 passes for 172
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Wuerffel played the second half and finished 16 of 25 for 269
yards and three touchdowns. He connected with Darnerien McCants for
touchdowns of 14 and 44 yards.</TE>

<HD>Bonds' 597th Homer Helps Schmidt Cruise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds, who knows all about coming back to Pittsburgh to play
before unfriendly fans, made it a lot easier for Jason Schmidt to get
over his nervousness about facing his former team.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds hit his 597th career homer and just missed another, leading
Schmidt and the San Francisco Giants past the Pirates, 11-6, Saturday
night.</LD>
<LD>   "I wasn't nervous at all before the game, but as soon as I stepped
on the mound, my knees were shaking," said Schmidt, who gave up seven
hits and four runs in 7 1/3 innings. "It's where I pitched for five
years. But getting those runs helped get the nervousness out of the
way."</LD>
<TE>   Bonds is still booed in Pittsburgh 10 years after leaving the
team, but a sellout crowd was much warmer to Schmidt (7-5), who was
traded to the Giants a little more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds moved within three homers of becoming the fourth major
leaguer with 600, powering Kip Wells' full-count pitch deep into the
right-field seats to put the Giants ahead, 5-0, in the second.</TE>
<TE>   The drive was his 30th--and 103rd in two seasons--and extended his
National League record to 11 consecutive seasons with 30 homers or
more. Jimmie Foxx holds the major league mark of 12.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds went two for three with four runs batted in before being
lifted with the Giants ahead by eight runs in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants stayed one game behind the Dodgers in the wild-card
race but fell seven behind Arizona in the NL West.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 6, St. Louis 1--Chipper Jones hit two two-run homers and
Jason Marquis pitched six strong innings at Atlanta, and the Braves
won their fifth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals lost their fourth in a row in the matchup of NL
division leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Jones is 13 for 23 with five homers and 13 runs batted in during
the eight-game home stand.</TE>
<TE>   Marquis (8-5) gave up five hits, twice ending threats by retiring
cleanup hitter Jim Edmonds.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 11, Milwaukee 7--Kevin Millar homered, doubled, singled
and had four RBIs for the Marlins at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Fox had three hits and drove in two runs in support of Brad
Penny (5-4), who gave four runs and nine hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 5, Montreal 3--Wade Miller won his sixth consecutive start
and Craig Biggio hit a tiebreaking home run in the eighth at
Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Miller (9-3), who went 5-0 in July, gave up three hits and three
runs in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Bagwell hit a three-run homer against Bartolo Colon in the
third. Brad Wilkerson's three-run homer against Miller in the fifth
tied the score, 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 2, Chicago 1--Denny Neagle (5-7) gave up two hits in six
innings in his first start since July 2, and Jay Payton had a two-run
double at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up Fred McGriff's 471st career home run in the
second, Neagle retired the next 15 batters before leaving for a
pinch-hitter in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 4, San Diego 3--Russell Branyan hit a two-run homer,
and the Reds took advantage of Brett Tomko's wildness at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Haynes won his career-best fifth consecutive decision, and
the Reds moved within three games of St. Louis in the NL Central.</TE>
<TE>   Tomko gave up four hits in seven innings, but he walked four in
the first inning--one with the bases loaded.</TE>

<HD>Mets Are Two-Timed by Arizona</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Diamondbacks win, 8-5 and 9-2, to sweep a
doubleheader without star pitchers Johnson and Schilling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Sweeping a doubleheader is difficult enough for the Arizona
Diamondbacks. Doing it without Curt Schilling or Randy Johnson is
truly shocking.</LD>
<LD>   Jay Bell hit his first homer in more than a year and matched his
career high with five runs batted in to spoil John Thomson's debut
with the New York Mets and give Arizona a 9-2 victory in the second
game Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Erubiel Durazo hit a three-run homer in the 10th inning, his
second home run in the first game, to give reliever Byung-Hyun Kim
and the Diamondbacks an 8-5 victory.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a fun day for us," first baseman Mark Grace said. "To come
here and win a doubleheader from these guys when the pitchers we had
throwing weren't named Schilling or Johnson is a real good day for
us."</TE>
<TE>   More than half of Arizona's victories before Saturday had come
from its two aces. But the Diamondbacks didn't need either one to
sweep a doubleheader for the first time in four tries in franchise
history.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona has won 10 of 12 to open a season-high six-game lead over
the second-place Dodgers in the National League West. New York has
lost four of five to fall into fifth place in the wild-card race,
five games behind the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson (7-9), acquired from Colorado at the trade deadline
Wednesday, gave up seven runs--three earned--and seven hits in six
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I did put more pressure on myself than I should have,"
Thomson said.</TE>

<HD>Soriano May Be Second to None</HD>

<LD>There was the unique odyssey that took him from the Dominican
Republic to Japan to a lost year spent partly in Los Angeles, and
then finally to the New York Yankees.</LD>
<LD>   There was the blizzard of trade rumors as one team after another
tried to obtain him, and there was the eventual and inevitable shift
in positions from Derek Jeter's shortstop to left field to second
base.</LD>
<LD>   It is difficult to know where to begin with the multilingual,
multitalented Alfonso Soriano, but maybe it should be said at the top
that in some ways his journey has just begun because there's no
telling how good he can be.</LD>
<TE>   Which, as teammate Rondell White suggests, is "pretty scary"
considering that at 24 he's already a candidate for the Most Valuable
Player award.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as White put it, he's "already a stud" who has "the potential
to be the best second baseman ever."</TE>
<TE>   Well, it can't be certain that the veteran White has memorized all
2,857 pages of the Baseball Encyclopedia, but if Don Zimmer, the
71-year-old coach who is a walking abridgement of that book, is going
to say Soriano is "one of the few players I would pay to watch," then
White seems justified in referring to him as "Super Sori" and
insisting he has some of the same raw, best-in-baseball skills as
White's former Montreal teammate Vladimir Guerrero.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not yet the defensive player Guerrero is, but they're the
only two teammates I've had who have told me they were going to hit a
home run in their next at-bat and backed it up," White said. "The
thing about Soriano is, he's confident without being cocky. He works
hard, plays hard and doesn't let anything get to him. He treats the
game as if it's PlayStation. A lot of us think he can be a 50-50
player."</TE>
<TE>   White meant 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in the same season.</TE>
<TE>   Why not?</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe some year, not this year," Soriano said. "Not enough games
left to hit 50 homers."</TE>
<TE>   Through Friday of his second full season, Soriano had 27 homers
and 30 stolen bases.</TE>
<TE>   He was batting .313, had driven in 67 runs, was second in the
American League in hits and led in steals, extra-base hits, total
bases, runs and doubles.</TE>
<TE>   When Jason Giambi, now back in MVP form, was struggling early in
his new uniform, Soriano helped carry the Yankees, a catalyst in the
leadoff role he won in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm confident in myself," he said. "More important, I'm more
comfortable at second base now and more comfortable with my
teammates."</TE>
<TE>   At his Edison Field locker this weekend, and generally elsewhere
when approached by language-limited U.S. reporters, Soriano speaks
improving English, determined to be at home away from home and
demonstrate what he has learned, in part, from watching American
movies.</TE>
<TE>   He is a native of the shortstop breeding ground that is San Pedro
de Macoris in the Dominican and also speaks Spanish, of course, along
with a modest measure of Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano spent two years with the Hiroshima Carp after signing at
16 when he visited their baseball academy not far from his home. He
yearned to play in the United States but had no offers and remembers
people telling him, "Sori, play two years there and then maybe they
will trade you to the majors."</TE>
<TE>   As difficult as the regimented demands of Japanese baseball were
for the young Soriano far from home, his departure was more so.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, he had to go on a voluntary retired list and ignore
what he viewed as threatening visits from Carp emissaries demanding
he return to Japan. He would also have to sit out the 1998 season as
Major League Baseball examined his case before declaring him a free
agent.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that year was spent with agent Don Nomura in Los Angeles
playing weekends in a beer league and taking sandlot batting practice
against a pitcher hired by Nomura.</TE>
<TE>   "It was difficult," Soriano said. "All I wanted to do was play.
Don was sure it would work out, but I was getting frustrated and
desperate.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I struck out against some old guy on the weekend, I
was sure no one would want to sign me."</TE>
<TE>   Once freed of his Japanese restrictions, the showcased Soriano was
widely pursued, signed a four-year, $3.1-million contract with the
Yankees and learned to ignore the persistent trade rumors as one club
after another (the Angels dangled Jim Edmonds) came knocking,
thinking Soriano had no realistic future in New York because of
Jeter.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, documenting the adage that the best trades are those that
aren't made, the Yankees did agree to trade Soriano and Ted Lilly to
Houston in June 2000 only to have Moises Alou, who had the right of
approval, disapprove of leaving the Astros.</TE>
<TE>   By the spring of 2001, Soriano wasn't going anywhere except left
field, and then only until late March, when the exasperated Yankees
decided they couldn't tolerate Chuck Knoblauch's throwing problems
and moved Knoblauch to left and Soriano to second.</TE>
<TE>   Adjusting to a new position in his first full season in the
majors, Soriano hit 18 homers, drove in 73 runs, finished third
behind Ichiro Suzuki and C.C. Sabathia in rookie-of-the-year
balloting and hit .276 in 17 postseason games. He won Game 4 of the
ALCS against Seattle with a walkoff homer and Game 5 of the World
Series against Arizona with a 12th-inning single, and he carried all
of that into spring training.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived, Manager Joe Torre said in Anaheim, "with that look in
his eye, knowing he had a job" and convincing Torre he could bat
leadoff despite his comparatively low on-base percentage and
free-swinging strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano struck out 125 times last year and will exceed that by the
end of the month, but the Yankees, convinced he is making adjustments
on his own, aren't demanding Super Sori cut down on his swing or
become something he isn't.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, we all know that if he cut his strikeouts in half, he'd
have that many more potential hits," said Zimmer, "but anybody who
preaches patience to this kid should be slapped. I mean, nobody likes
to strike out, but it just doesn't bother him just like he has no
fear on the bases. He'll swing and miss a pitch that bounces in front
of the plate and leave you thinking he doesn't belong in the majors,
and the next time up he'll hit it in the water fountain in center
field. He's just a wild swinger, and we can live with that."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Torre uses the word "unpredictable"
to describe Soriano at the plate, but he could use it in other
contexts because he still, on occasion, has to lecture Soriano for
"being more fan than participant," for lapses on the bases or
standing and watching a soaring home run, as he did in the ALCS only
to have the ball carom off the fence, and Soriano ending up with a
single.</TE>
<TE>   It's all still a learning experience for a player who General
Manager Brian Cashman believes has more "explosive power, speed and
raw abilities" than the "five-tool Jeter" and who, in the view of
second base mentor Willie Randolph, infuses the Yankees "with juice
and energy."</TE>
<TE>   "Last year," said Zimmer, "you'd cringe wondering if he was going
to catch the ball and cringe wondering where he might throw it. He's
made unbelievable progress in the field."</TE>
<TE>   An admittedly tough critic, Randolph said he needs to see
consistency on a long-term basis before he begins predicting
Cooperstown or a career of Gold Gloves.</TE>
<TE>   But he said that with the confidence that comes of knowing he now
has a position, with his "quick, lean and agile racehorse body,"
Soriano has begun to turn his focus to defense and there is no reason
he won't join with Jeter to "give Yankee fans a very special
combination for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   No reason, said historian White, he can't be the best second
baseman ever.</TE>

<LD>My first inclination Saturday night was to go to Las Vegas, sit
behind home plate and wave to Kevin Brown, who was going to be
pitching for the Dodgers' minor league team. I just thought it would
be a hoot.</LD>
<LD>   Then I got to thinking what if we'd booked the same Southwest
Airlines flight to Las Vegas, I'm on the aisle, there's only one
middle seat left on the plane and Mr. Grumpy's the last guy to board.
I know one thing, I'm not getting on any plane with Mr. Grumpy
without first being issued a parachute.</LD>
<LD>   So I chose to go to Anaheim instead for the Angel-Yankee game and
chat with Jarrod Washburn, every bit the gritty, fiery bulldog that
Brown is with one exception: He likes human beings.</LD>
<TE>   Three hours before game time I found Washburn sitting in the back
of the clubhouse intently studying something. This is why the kid is
13-3, I figured, until I got closer and noticed he was analyzing this
year's "Playboy Playmate Review." Just what you'd expect, of course,
from someone who likes human beings.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been waiting all week for this magazine," he said, and
because he was already to Miss October and late into the year, I told
him I'd wait.</TE>
<TE>   I joined the rest of the Angels, who were watching "Ocean's
Eleven" on the clubhouse TV, and while I found it a little odd the
guys were skipping batting practice after scoring only 10 runs in the
previous seven games, it was a good movie.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ANGELS announced Saturday they were giving Darin Erstad $32
million to stay in Anaheim the next four years, and I know that's
what it would take for me to spend four years in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave him a big hug," said Washburn, who is being paid $350,000
this season as the Angels' ace. "I make a mistake and this guy goes
and runs it down and saves the day. He's special."</TE>
<TE>   Now you spend any time with Washburn and he's going to be talking
about his teammates (or Miss October) and how good they are. He's
also going to tell you he knows folks are counting on him to fold
after doing so late in the season the past two years--just like the
Angels--but bring on the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, of course, will go nowhere without Washburn and the
Rally Monkey. Remember last year when Washburn went ape because
everyone in Edison Field sang "Happy Birthday" to the Rally Monkey?</TE>
<TE>   "No regrets," he said. "Some people think I talk before I think,
but I know what I'm saying, and when I say something, I've got to
live with it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Rally Monkey is great for the fans to get everyone
going, but the whole Happy Birthday business with the monkey jumping
on home plate was stupid. Obviously the monkey wasn't helping us that
day while we were losing something like 14-1--he was probably too
busy partying."</TE>
<TE>   Ask him a question, he looks you directly in the eye and provides
an answer. It's the way he pitches. Someone hits a home run off him
on an inside fastball, and "almost every time, the next chance I get
to pitch to him," he said, "I'm going to give him an inside fastball
because I'm coming right after him."</TE>
<TE>   Same with the Rally Monkey. Take away a three-run lead, as the
Yankees did with Bernie Williams hitting a home run off Troy Percival
in the top of the eighth,  and the little fella is right up there on
the scoreboard jumping up and down.</TE>
<TE>   One pitch after the Monkey makes his appearance Saturday, Tim
Salmon homers for a 5-4 lead in the bottom of the eighth, and the
Angels go on to record a stirring victory. Washburn and the Rally
Monkey, really two peas in the same pod, yeah, I wonder what he's got
to say about that?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MY BEST to Chick Hearn, and while I know what doctors have said, I
still have to be convinced that the kind and gentle man I know, who
showed the stamina to work 3,338 consecutive Laker games, won't be
behind the microphone again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I UNDERSTAND Brown met with the media after his 3 2/3-inning stint
against the Memphis Redbirds in Las Vegas. No report on how many
casualties.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ON THE board in the Angels' clubhouse I saw this note: "Please
pack bats before Sunday's game," with "before" underlined." I didn't
like the Angels' chances of scoring against the Yankees today before
I saw the note. Now I'm really worried.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MOST BASKETBALL fans know all about NBA make-up calls, but
Saturday we got a real good look at a major league make-up call in
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had thrown a national tantrum after home-plate umpire
Dan Iassogna had tossed Eric Gagne from a game earlier in the week.
They made their point--winning an apology from umpiring officials,
and getting the kindly call.</TE>
<TE>   Two out in the ninth and two strikes on Shawn Green, and it was up
to third base umpire Joe West to determine if Green had swung at
strike three, as replays showed he did. West elected not to end the
game on a Dodger strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   Green homered on the next pitch to tie the score, and the Dodgers
won in extra innings. With the Diamondbacks winning twice, and the
Giants also victorious, Joe West just might be in line for a playoff
share if the dramatic comeback puts the Dodgers back on track. At the
very least, one ump made up for another's bad call.</TE>
<TE>   Some people think the fix is in when comes to who wins NBA playoff
games; it would be nice to think the same thing happens in MLB. That
would seem to be the Dodgers' best hope.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CNN broadcaster Larry King called with yet another correction:
"I've only been married five times, and they are all still smiling."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Ken Lund:</TE>
<TE>   "Your writing brings no insight to the sports world, no
thought-provoking ideas or comments regarding the human and business
side of sports. Your column is filled with meaningless fluff
requiring little thought on your part, and less thought on the
reader."</TE>
<TE>   And I thought I was writing over your head.</TE>

<LD>Oh, for a decent squabble.</LD>
<LD>   What soccer fans in this country wouldn't give for just a few
angry words, a few blunt comments, a few honest appraisals, a few
remarks that have the ring of truth and passion about them.</LD>
<LD>   At the All-Star break of Major League Soccer's seventh season, the
majority of the league's players, coaches and officials still have a
difficult time being outspoken. Political correctness and fear of
reprisal rules the day and ruins the league.</LD>
<TE>   It's the same with the U.S. national teams. No one ever has
anything critical to say. It's all puff and no pastry.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't that way in the rest of the world. There, the pot is
constantly kept boiling by the opinions of those unafraid to voice
them, media included. Take last week, for example.</TE>
<TE>   It began with Brazil Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari criticizing
Ronaldo, of all people. A few days earlier, Scolari had ridiculed
Pele, saying that he "knows nothing" about the sport. This time, he
said that the player whose eight goals propelled Brazil to its fifth
World Cup was "spoiled" and had to be taught to think in terms of
team rather than self.</TE>
<TE>   "Ronaldo is a player--how can I put it?--he's a little spoiled,"
Scolari told a Rio de Janeiro radio station. "We tried to show him
the other side of things, the interest of the group.... He reconciled
himself with that way of thinking to end up doing what we wanted of
him."</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo wasted little time responding via his Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned one thing in football," the Inter Milan striker said in
an oblique reference to Scolari. "Sometimes it is more difficult to
react to victory than defeat."</TE>
<TE>   He also disputed Scolari's assessment that he would never be 100%
fit again after two knee surgeries, and that he has difficulty
maintaining his ideal weight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's strange that in two months together at the World Cup he
never told me this," Ronaldo said. "At least I have always been
sincere with him."</TE>
<TE>   That little give and go had no sooner been smoothed over than it
was time for France forward Nicolas Anelka to lay into one of his
former coaches, Luis Fernandez of Paris St Germain. "When he came in
[as coach], we had a young team with great potential, but he
dismantled it to bring in his own players," Anelka, now with
Manchester City, told the British magazine FourFourTwo. "It was
impossible to talk to him. He gets angry whenever you try to have a
discussion with him.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not an intelligent man. As soon as you try to talk to him,
he just loses it, simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   Anelka also lashed out at Liverpool's French coach, Gerard
Houllier, who decided not to sign Anelka after the forward had spent
six months with the team on loan from Paris St Germain. Instead,
Houllier acquired Senegal World Cup striker El-Hadji Diouf.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems that Gerard Houllier did not appreciate my personality,"
Anelka said. "It bothered him to have someone around who could stand
up to him."</TE>
<TE>   Houllier ignored the jibe, but Fernandez reacted by poking fun at
Anelka, who was not selected for France's World Cup team.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez, a respected former midfielder for France, started his
career with an amateur team in Lyon called Minguettes, a lowly
beginning he remains proud of to this day.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Anelka] is looking for another club after Manchester City, I
just want him to know that AS Minguettes are interested in signing
him," Fernandez said in Paris. "After Arsenal, Real Madrid, Paris St
Germain, Liverpool and Manchester City, Minguettes could be a good
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "He has everything to do well there. But he must be careful
because it's a good club and he will have to struggle to become a
regular first choice."</TE>
<TE>   That should silence Anelka for while, but hopefully not.</TE>
<TE>   Being a World Cup winner helps a player to speak out and ignore
the consequences, which is why France's captain, defender Marcel
Desailly, last week was unafraid to criticize Claudio Ranieri, his
coach at Chelsea.</TE>
<TE>   Desailly told the English club's television channel, Chelsea TV,
that the team was better under former coach Gianluca Vialli.</TE>
<TE>   "The team under Vialli were more ready to cope when they were in
trouble, to analyze the game and come through it," Desailly said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, although we have more quality, we are a bit crazy. We are
not able to analyze the moment. We are not able to slow down and keep
what we have in our pockets.... We are only sometimes like a good
team, but we do not have enough [confidence] about
ourselves--individually or collectively--to get out of trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Another World Cup winner, Brazil's Rivaldo, also got into an
interesting feud, lambasting Barcelona's Dutch coach, Louis van Gaal,
for questioning his lack of commitment and motivation and therefore
allowing him to leave for AC Milan.</TE>
<TE>   "He is envious because I won a tournament [the Korea/Japan World
Cup] that he couldn't even qualify for [as coach of the
Netherlands]," Rivaldo said on his Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sorry for Van Gaal and understand why he is so angry. With
all the stars in the Dutch team, he wasn't even capable of guiding
them toward qualification for the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Soccer in the U.S. needs to develop a similar nasty edge.</TE>
<TE>   When players and coaches are not good enough, they need to be told
that fact. In public. Loudly.</TE>
<TE>   As long as everything is sweetness and light, as long as anything
that even resembles an unwelcome truth is swept under the rug, as
long as it's all rah-rah and public relations, the sport will go

<TE>   There are a few beacons of hope--honest and outspoken souls such

of silence.</TE>

<HD>Mabika Helps Sparks End Monarchs' Streak</HD>
<DH>WNBA: Her 20 points are key in 81-71 victory as Sacramento
loses after franchise-record six consecutive victories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Mwadi Mabika had 20 points, nine rebounds and six assists Saturday to
help the Sparks end the Sacramento Monarchs' franchise-record
six-game winning streak with an 81-71 victory before 11,480 at Arco
Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Mabika had 15 second-half points as the Sparks (21-6) avoided
their first three-game losing streak since last season.</LD>
<LD>   The Sparks, who made 11 of 23 three-point shots, have won eight in
a row over Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   "This was a big game on the road for us against a tough team,"
Spark Coach Michael Cooper said. "They have their important people
back. They are a tough team. With them back, we probably would have
been battling them again in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Leading 61-59, the Sparks went on an eight-point run--paced by
three-point baskets from Tamecka Dixon and Nikki Teasley.</TE>
<TE>   Teasley made five three-pointers and scored a career-best 18
points. Dixon added 13 and DeLisha Milton had 11.</TE>
<TE>   "My teammates were telling me to take the shots because Ticha
[Penicheiro] was playing off me," Teasley said. "They got me the ball
and helped me get shots."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Leslie tied a season-low with only four points, going the
first 26 minutes without a basket. She finished one for nine from the
field with nine rebounds and seven turnovers before fouling out.</TE>
<TE>   Easily winning the battle inside against Leslie, Yolanda Griffith
helped keep Sacramento (10-17) close with season bests of 28 points
and 15 rebounds. Ruthie Bolton made five three-pointers and scored 17
points.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have got the ball more to Yolanda, who did a wonderful
job on Lisa Leslie," Monarch Coach Maura McHugh said. "She played
like a warrior."</TE>
<TE>   Penicheiro had 16 assists, matching her WNBA record, set July 29,
1998, against Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Penicheiro, who also had five steals and six rebounds, joined New
York's Teresa Weatherspoon as the only WNBA players to have at least
1,000 career assists.</TE>
<TE>   "One thousand assists feels good, but I would have rather traded
it for a victory," Penicheiro said.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento forward Tangela Smith scored six points, ending a
streak of 20 consecutive games in double figures.</TE>

Sacramento, the team the Sparks beat Saturday to end their first

<HD>Menczer's Success Is Coming in Waves</HD>
<DH>Surfing: Australian defends her title at Huntington Beach.
Tudor wins longboard title for seventh time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pauline Menczer might not be a crowd favorite in Huntington Beach,
but the thousands of spectators who watched her defend the women's
title Saturday at the Philips U.S. Open of Surfing provided a wealth
of inspiration.</LD>
<LD>   Menczer took the lead from fellow Australian Trudy Todd late in
the 30-minute final, which also included Sofia Mulanovich of Peru and
Jacqueline Silva of Brazil. Menczer totaled 18.96 points for her
three best wave scores, followed by Todd with 16.80.</LD>
<LD>   It was the seventh career World Qualifying Series victory for
Menczer, who earned $6,000 for the victory.</LD>
<TE>   "I do thrive off the crowd here," said Menczer, 32, who came into
the event ranked 15th in the WQS. "They say surfers are the biggest
showoffs, which is true."</TE>
<TE>   Todd took an early lead in the final and maintained it until
Menczer scored a 7.10 on a right-hand wave with about six minutes
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Todd, who scored a last-minute victory in the semifinals to
advance, rushed from the beach after the final to make an 8 p.m.
flight to France, where she is scheduled to compete in the next WQS
event beginning Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Todd said the quick exit added to an already frenetic week of
promotional appearances, but did little to affect her surfing.</TE>
<TE>   "The more I do, the better I do at things," Todd said.</TE>
<TE>   Mulanovich, the top-ranked woman in the WQS before the event,
finished third with 15.33 points. Silva, ranked seventh and loudly
supported by a small Brazilian contingent during the final, finished
last with 13.94 points.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Tudor of Del Mar won the longboard title for the seventh time
and fifth in the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Tudor, the 1999 longboard world champion, took the lead from
Huntington Beach's Josh Mohr with about seven minutes remaining after
receiving a score of 8.17. Tudor punctuated the ride by standing on
the nose of the board and arching his back, a move he learned from
former U.S. champion David Nuuhiwa, who watched from the stands.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so influential in my surfing," said Tudor, who earned
$2,500 for the victory. "I always try to go out and do what he did."</TE>
<TE>   The men's shortboard contest was trimmed to 32 surfers after the
morning round of 64. Many of the top professionals made their first
appearance Saturday, including Pat O'Connell of Laguna Beach, who won
the 12th heat.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell said he felt a little shaky in the beginning because he
hadn't surfed Huntington Beach in preparation, opting to remain at
Salt Creek, his home break approximately 25 miles to the south.</TE>
<TE>   "The waves are a lot different at Salt Creek," said O'Connell, 30,
who was married last month. "Luckily, I've been competing here long
enough to know there are a few constants from year to year, and I
found some of them."</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell will be paired with Ben Bourgeois of Wilmington, N.C.,
and Australians Trent Munro and Troy Brooks when the round of 32
begins this morning at 8.</TE>
<TE>   Other heat winners included Oxnard's Tim Curran and San Clemente's
Shane Beschen and Chris Ward. Former world champions Sunny Garcia of
Hawaii and Tom Curren of Ventura advanced from the same heat. Garcia
won with 15.16 points and Curren finished second with 10.66.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Machado of Cardiff, Kalani Robb of Hawaii and Damien Hobgood
of Florida were among the other heat winners.</TE>

<HD>Davenport Has the Home-Court Edge</HD>
<DH>Tennis: The Laguna Beach resident, coming off knee surgery,
aims for her fourth Manhattan Beach title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lindsay Davenport likes to hit close to home, and the Manhattan Beach
Country Club is right in her comfort zone. Davenport has won the WTA
tournament at Manhattan Beach three times in the past six years, and
she'll be chasing another title in the JPMorgan Chase Open, which
begins today and runs through Aug. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Davenport, ranked No. 9 in the world, is the defending champion
but is seeded third this year behind Serena Williams, the world's No.
1-ranked player, and Jennifer Capriati, who is ranked third. The
48-player draw includes five of the top nine and 18 of the top 30
players.</LD>
<LD>   Seeded fourth through eighth are Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia, Kim
Clijsters of Belgium, Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia, Elena
Dementieva of Russia and Daja Bedanova of the Czech Republic.</LD>
<TE>   Davenport, who has a first-round bye and will face the winner of a
match between Francesca Schiavone of Italy and Elena Bovina of
Russia, has always felt at home in the tournament. The Laguna Beach
resident won it in 1996, '98 and last year, when she defeated Monica
Seles in the final, 6-3, 7-5. Davenport also reached to the final in
2000, losing to Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "I've won it a bunch of times. I've lost in the finals," she said
Friday after beating Ai Sugiyama in the quarterfinals of the Acura
Classic in Carlsbad. . "I think basically it's the conditions I
practice in year-round at home. I'm used to it. It's such a great
sweep for me, these couple of tournaments.... It's so easy. If I lose
early, I go home."</TE>
<TE>   This will be Davenport's third singles tournament in a comeback
from January surgery on her right knee that has gone more smoothly
and successfully than she expected. She lost, 6-2, 6-1, to Venus
Williams in her Acura Classic semifinal Saturday night. She also
reached the semifinals of the Bank of the West Classic in Palo Alto
last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I was afraid when I was first coming back that I'd second-guess
myself and have more worries. But I really have none out there right
now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I really struggled in TeamTennis when I first started about 2 1/2
weeks ago. That was so good for me to play. It helped my game a lot.
It would have been extremely difficult to start at Wimbledon, at such
a big stage."</TE>
<TE>   Serena Williams shined there, beating older sister Venus to win
that title and ascend to the No. 1 ranking. Serena Williams also won
the French Open with a victory over Venus in the final. Capriati won
the Australian Open in January.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport was off the tour about six months recovering and
rehabilitating her knee. But it has given her no problems lately.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have to ice it," she said. "I definitely get it warmed up
and I stretch my right leg really well. There's no swelling or pain,
so I don't have to do anything after."</TE>
<TE>   Except maybe go home to Laguna Beach.</TE>

<HD>Changes Proposed by NCAA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NCAA's football study oversight committee has proposed changes to
improve players' safety during conditioning workouts.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, presented Friday by Grant Teaff, the former Baylor coach
who is executive director of the American Football Coaches Assn.,
provides clearer instruction regarding summer two-a-day practices. It
could go into effect in January.</LD>
<LD>   The committee recommended a five-day acclimatization period at the
beginning of summer conditioning, forbidding two-a-day practices
during that period and restricting player workouts in full pads and a
helmet to the fifth day only.</LD>
<TE>   During the two-a-day schedule that would follow, players would be
given at least a three-hour break between practices and two-a-day
sessions could not be conducted on consecutive days.</TE>
<TE>   Three college players, Northwestern's Rashidi Wheeler, Florida
State's DeVaughn Darling and Florida's Eraste Autin, died after
summer conditioning workouts last year.</TE>
<TE>   Tory Aggeler, Northwestern's head trainer when Wheeler died, said
the safeguards would make workouts more uniform.</TE>
<TE>   "When Gary Barnett was coaching at Northwestern, he had
three-a-day practices," Aggeler said.</TE>
<TE>   "These new rules are ironic, though, because [Wildcat] Coach
[Randy] Walker handles two-a-days exactly like these rules will
stipulate."</TE>
<TE>   NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said the proposal will be
presented to the Division I management council in October.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal also requires medical examinations for all players
and mandatory CPR training for strength and conditioning coaches, who
often oversee voluntary workouts and weightlifting sessions.</TE>
<TE>   An eight-week period between January and summer conditioning would
be designated as student-athlete discretionary time.</TE>
<TE>   During those eight weeks, the player still would be required to
complete eight hours of conditioning a week.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rigorous 28-sprint conditioning drill banned by Northwestern
Athletic Director Rick Taylor following the death of football player
Rashidi Wheeler last year has been made easier this season.</LD>
<LD>   Junior running back Jason Wright said Coach Randy Walker has
installed a new conditioning test of two 300-yard shuttle runs.</LD>
<LD>   The drill will be conducted at Northwestern's training camp in
Kenosha, Wis., where players will begin formal practices Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Wright, a Diamond Bar High graduate who said he was one of several
Northwestern players to collapse at the completion of last year's
drill on the day Wheeler died, said the new test requires players to
sprint 25 yards, touch the ground and return to the start point--back
and forth until 300 yards are completed.</TE>
<TE>   After a five-minute break, the player must repeat the series of 12
25-yard sprints. Skill-position players have 55 seconds to complete
each of the 300-yard shuttles.</TE>
<TE>   Wheeler collapsed before concluding last year's more demanding
drill of 10 100-yard sprints, eight 80s, six 60s and four 40s. He
died of exercise-induced bronchial asthma barely more than an hour
later at Evanston (Ill.) Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern coaches violated NCAA rules by timing and filming the
drill during the voluntary workout period, and by requiring those
players who failed to complete it in the required time to repeat it
in Kenosha. The Wildcats forfeited six regular-season practices for
the violations.</TE>
<TE>   "I practiced it on my own time this year during a practice led by
some of the seniors," Wright said. "I wanted to do it, just to be
sure I could do it in Kenosha. No coaches were there. None at all."</TE>
<TE>   Wright said Northwestern athletic officials and coaches have
fostered a more player-friendly style since Wheeler's death.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a feel," Wright said. "There's been no pamphlet given
out about changes in coaching style, but you can just feel it."</TE>

<DH>Angels: After Yankees tie score in top of eighth, his home
run in bottom of inning gives Anaheim a 5-4 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If this were October, this would be the kind of game savored,
analyzed and replayed for years to come. And, with this kind of
success under pressure, the Angels might well advance to the playoffs
for the first time in 16 years.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Mike Scioscia likes to preach that all games are equal in
importance, but some games are more equal than others. For the second
time this season, and with the Angels four outs away from defeating
the mighty New York Yankees, Scioscia summoned closer Troy Percival
before the ninth inning.</LD>
<LD>   Percival blew the save. No matter. He won the game.</LD>
<TE>   After Bernie Williams tagged Percival for the game-tying home run
in the top of the eighth, Tim Salmon tagged Ramiro Mendoza for the
game-winning home run in the bottom of the eighth. Percival retired
the Yankees in the ninth, preserving a dramatic 5-4 victory Saturday
that ensured the Angels would do no worse than split this four-game
series.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt it was a big game," Salmon said. "Any time you
play the Yankees, it's a big game, and we're playing for something
right now."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels built a 4-0 lead, lost it all in the eighth inning and
won anyway, a thriller before a raucous sellout crowd of 43,619 at
Edison Field. The Angels reclaimed a one-game lead over the Boston
Red Sox in the American League wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   If Percival congratulated Salmon on the home run that flipped
deflation into elation, Salmon didn't hear it.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so fired up, I didn't hear much from anybody," Salmon said.
"I was too busy high-fiving people."</TE>
<TE>   If the championship teams win the close games, the Angels might be
on their way. They have won 12 of their last 14 one-run games.</TE>
<TE>   Angel starter Aaron Sele was magnificent, carrying a two-hit
shutout and a 4-0 lead into the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   After Nick Johnson led off the eighth with a single, on Sele's
111th pitch, Scioscia opted for the bullpen. Scioscia called on Ben
Weber, whose forte is getting batters to hit ground balls.</TE>
<TE>   Rondell White hit a ground ball, but it rolled into left field for
a single. Alfonso Soriano hit a ground ball to shortstop, and the
Angels forced White at second. Derek Jeter hit another ground ball to
shortstop, and the Angels forced Soriano at second, with Johnson
scoring the Yankees' first run.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia then summoned left-hander Scott Schoeneweis to face the
left-handed Jason Giambi. Schoeneweis had not given up a hit in six
consecutive appearances, but Giambi singled.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the tying runs on base, Scioscia called on Percival to
face Williams. Scioscia said the move reflected less of an emphasis
on this particular game and more on the recent workload of two other
relievers, Brendan Donnelly and Scot Shields.</TE>
<TE>   "And I thought the matchup was important enough to bring Percival
on," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Percival pitched in the eighth inning, on May 30 in
Minnesota, he blew the save.</TE>
<TE>   He did this time too, with Williams poking an 0-2 fastball just
inside the right-field foul pole for a three-run home run. The homer
tied the score, 4-4, and tied Williams with Don Mattingly on the
all-time Yankee home run list, at 222.</TE>
<TE>   Since that May day in Minnesota, Percival had converted 17
consecutive save opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "Sele deserved to get that win. I didn't want it," Percival said.
"I'd prefer to have the save."</TE>
<TE>   Troy Glaus, celebrating his 26th birthday, singled with two out in
the fourth inning. On the next pitch, Brad Fullmer hit a home run,
his 12th of the season and his second in August. He hit none in July.</TE>
<TE>   Darin Erstad, signed to a four-year, $32-million contract
extension earlier in the day, singled to start the sixth inning. He
later scored on a double by Salmon, and Salmon later scored on a
sacrifice fly by Glaus, giving the Angels a 4-0 lead.</TE>

<HD>Hearn News Not Good</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Doctor says legendary broadcaster probably has
called his last game after undergoing two brain operations. He is
critical but stable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER, LARRY STEWART and STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chick Hearn, the Lakers' beloved announcer of 42 years, probably will
never call another game after undergoing two brain surgeries
Saturday, his doctors said.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very concerned with his speech ability and feel it is very
likely he will have difficulty speaking," said Dr. Asher Taban, who
performed two craniotomies on Hearn on Saturday at Northridge
Hospital Medical Center to control brain hemorrhages suffered during
a Friday evening fall.</LD>
<LD>   When asked if Hearn's announcing career was over, Taban said,
"Unfortunately, that is probable."</LD>
<TE>   Hearn, 85, was about to move a planter on his Encino patio when he
fell back and hit the back of his head. The impact caused a blood
clot about 6 inches in diameter to form on the surface of his brain,
Taban said. To relieve pressure, Taban drilled a small hole in his
skull and drained the blood.</TE>
<TE>   Although his condition initially improved, Hearn was back in
surgery by midmorning to remove a second, "quite sizable" clot that
put pressure on his brain stem in an area that is "very important for
both survival and to be conscious," Taban said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn was in critical but stable condition Saturday evening,
heavily sedated to control both his blood pressure and the pressure
inside his head. Until Hearn comes off the sedatives, it will be
difficult to determine his prognosis and level of damage, Taban said.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Marge, and granddaughter Shannon Hearn Newman and her
husband, along with Laker spokesman Bob Steiner, Hearn's longtime
broadcast partner Stu Lantz and Susan Stratton, the Lakers' longtime
television producer-director, were among those keeping vigil at the
hospital Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Marge, his wife of nearly 64 years, asked pertinent questions
before the surgeries, Taban said, and "wants everything to be done as
long as there is hope for a recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Newman said that her grandfather--who first seized hold of the
Laker microphone in 1961 and almost never let go--did not regain
consciousness after the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Never bet against Chick Hearn," Laker General Manger Mitch
Kupchak said in an interview from the Bay Area. "He's a resilient
person. I heard many times last season he wouldn't come back and he
did.'"</TE>
<TE>   Hearn had a 3,338-consecutive-game streak that started in 1965
broken by heart surgery last December.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Sunderland, who stepped in to replace Hearn while he was
recovering from the surgery and a later broken hip, also cited
Hearn's toughness.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's hope and pray he is able to recover," he said. "We all
understand the gravity of the situation, but anyone who counts out
Chick Hearn is making a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "I've said before I really wanted Chick to come back for one more
glorious season."</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland would appear to be the heir apparent as the next
play-by-play voice of the Lakers, but team and broadcast officials
have said in the past that whenever the time came to replace Hearn,
all legitimate candidates would be considered.</TE>
<TE>   As word of Hearn's condition was broadcast over television and
radio stations throughout the day Saturday, colleagues and friends of
the "Voice of the Lakers" reflected on a career that has spanned
three generations of Los Angeles basketball fans.</TE>
<TE>   "To do what he did as long as he did with fresh and unabashed
enthusiasm is truly astonishing," said ABC's Al Michaels, who was
briefly Hearn's first analyst in 1967 and went on to become a
respected network play-by-play announcer.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of anybody like him," Michaels said. "Some guys
have had long and illustrious and storied careers, some go on and on
into their 80s like Ernie Harwell. But there's never been anybody
like Chick."</TE>
<TE>   Laker owner Jerry Buss was in London and could not be reached for
comment. But Buss' daughter Jeanie, the Lakers' executive vice
president who was 17 when her father bought the Lakers, said that
Hearn "has been the common tie of all the great Laker teams."</TE>
<TE>   As her voice cracked with emotion she added, "I'm sorry, I'm a
little upset right now. We're just hoping for the best, that he can
pull through. He is a valuable member of the franchise because of
what he means to the fans of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn's hospitalization comes after a difficult year health-wise.
Sidelined first by heart-valve replacement surgery in December, he
fell at a gas station in February, requiring hip replacement surgery.</TE>
<TE>   But he was back behind the microphone in time to call out his
trademark "words-eye view" for all of the Laker playoff games,
climaxing with their third consecutive NBA championship in June.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned to the announcer's chair April 9 after a 56-game
absence, the game against the Utah Jazz was more like a sideshow to
the welcome-back ovations and tributes from Vin Scully, Tom Lasorda
and Penny Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   He is known for his rapid-fire announcing, his folksy humor and as
the man whose words brought sparkle to the Lakers' moves with his
so-called "Chickisms."</TE>
<TE>   He's the wordsmith who invented the airball, the finger roll and
described bad, flashy plays gone wrong as "the mustard's off the hot
dog." American sports fans have Hearn to thank for a phrase ingrained
in pop culture: "slam dunk!"</TE>
<TE>   When Laker victories were at hand Hearn, who is honored in the
basketball Hall of Fame, would spew out one of Los Angeles'
best-loved lyrics:</TE>
<TE>   "The game's in the refrigerator, the door's closed, the light's
out, the eggs are cooling, the butter's getting hard and the Jell-O's
jiggling."</TE>
<TE>   Even during the off-season, the indefatigable Hearn found a way to
do Laker play-by-play, if mainly for fun. Just last week he drove to
Las Vegas with Marge to act as the celebrity announcer for a Laker
fantasy game, in which adults pay to be coached by real Laker
coaches, culminating in a game announced by Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   At Hearn's star along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which was
scrubbed clean Friday by a team of firefighters, passersby who were
following his condition expressed their admiration.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an NBA legend and I'm a big fan," said Zack Calandra, 32, a
sports broadcaster himself on vacation from Cottonwood, Ariz. "He's
an inspiration and one of the guys I listened to growing up. I hope
he's going to be OK--he'd be a sad person to lose in the sports
world."</TE>
<TE>   Jon Ogar, 49, a public relations specialist and avid sports fan
from Lansing, Mich., agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a voice that, once you hear it, you immediately recognize
it.... His is one of the great voices in the country."</TE>

<HD>Green's Swing Checks Out OK</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: His second homer of the game ties it in the ninth,
and Karros' single beats Phillies in 12th, 8-6.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>All-Star right fielder Shawn Green is the key ingredient in a
blueprint for success the Dodgers are eager to rediscover.</LD>
<LD>   Green provided the power and the Dodgers got timely contributions
from others Saturday in an 8-6, 12-inning victory over the
Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Green hit a ninth-inning, two-out, two-run home run on a full
count against Philadelphia reliever Dan Plesac--on the pitch
following a check swing--to force extra innings, prompting many in a
crowd of 23,056 to stay longer than expected on another scorching
day.</LD>
<TE>   His second homer of the game set the stage for Eric Karros, whose
bases-loaded single in the 12th against David Coggin (2-3) drove in
Cesar Izturis and Green with the game's final runs.</TE>
<TE>   "Greenie had a great game today," Karros said. "Hopefully, it's
something similar to what happened earlier in the year, and puts him
on a tear for about a month."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Quantrill entered and gave up a leadoff single to Placido
Polanco, stirring concern less than 24 hours after he failed to
preserve a 1-0 lead in the eighth inning of the Phillies' 3-1
victory.</TE>
<TE>   But Quantrill retired the next three batters, getting his first
save of the season and nailing down the victory for closer Eric Gagne
(1-0), who was typically dominant in two innings of work. The Dodgers
(61-49) rebounded after dropping the opener to the Phillies, and are
5-6 on the trip and 7-15 in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   They left the clubhouse happy for one of the few times recently
despite another bad outing from starter Kazuhisa Ishii. Mike
Lieberthal hit two homers against the left-hander, who gave up six
hits and five runs in five innings after lasting only 2 2/3 innings
in his previous start.</TE>
<TE>   But the good outweighed the bad for the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows it's about a team effort, and that's what we got
today, but Greenie is the guy we count on to do things like that,"
second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. "We count on him because he's
capable of doing it so often.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no secret we've really been struggling. It seems like we're
not getting any breaks and everything is going against us. But when
you get a team effort like today, with Greenie doing what he's done
so many times before, it really helps."</TE>
<TE>   Green was the catalyst with four hits in a 14-hit attack, hitting
homers Nos. 29 and 30. Karros had three hits.</TE>
<TE>   That's the formula Manager Jim Tracy relied on during the first
half, and the figures finally added up favorably again.</TE>
<TE>   "I was [recently] asked the question, 'How important is this guy
for us through the course of the remaining games?' " Tracy said of
Green. "Do we have to see him go on quite the binge that we saw him
go on, once he got untracked through the first six weeks? To me, the
answer to the question is no.</TE>
<TE>   "But do we need a solid performance from him when he gets
opportunities, when people go after him? Yes we do. We have to have
that from him. Absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   Green delivered with his sixth multi-homer game of the season and
23rd of his career, driving in three runs and scoring three. His
leadoff homer to right in the third against Philadelphia starter Joe
Roa tied the score, 3-3, and his third-level blast to right in the
ninth pulled the Dodgers even again.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Hansen, hitting for Marquis Grissom, had an outstanding
two-out at-bat against former Dodger Terry Adams with Green on deck.
Philadelphia Manager Larry Bowa used Adams in the save situation
because closer Jose Mesa was not available after recording his 31st
save Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen singled to center, making Green the potential tying run.
The left-handed Plesac replaced Adams to face the left-handed-batting
Green, hitless in two at-bats with a strikeout against Plesac in his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen advanced to second with the defense conceding the base, and
the count went to 2-and-2 when Green checked his swing. Or did he?</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't feel like I did [swing] at the time, but it's a judgment
call, it's real close," said Green, who watched nervously as third
base umpire Joe West ruled he checked his swing on appeal. "Looking
back, now, it doesn't really matter."</TE>

<HD>Reality Served Cold by Venus</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Williams crushes Davenport in semifinal at
Carlsbad, giving Dokic little reason to believe she can beat her
today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>Jelena Dokic, who rarely lacks confidence, hardly sounded optimistic
about her chances against Venus Williams in today's final of the
Acura Classic.</LD>
<LD>   "She presents all sorts of problems for everyone," said Dokic, who
fought off two match points in her semifinal victory against Anna
Kournikova of Russia. "Serena [Williams] is the only one to beat her
recently. She has the power and the speed. Maybe if she commits 50 or
60 unforced errors, I'll have a chance."</LD>
<LD>   There was laughter in the interview room, and Dokic joined in. But
she wasn't joking.</LD>
<TE>   Lindsay Davenport, who won three games against Venus Williams on
Saturday night, handicapped the final and supported Dokic's thesis
after an up-close-and-personal drubbing. Williams, the two-time
defending champion and top-seeded player, defeated No. 3 Davenport,
6-2, 6-1, in 60 minutes at the La Costa Resort and Spa.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe Jelena will, hopefully, play better than I did," Davenport
said. "I think that Venus is going to win, no offense to Jelena.
She's going to have to play a great match. I see Venus winning it. I
don't know how bad that is to say."</TE>
<TE>   Reality hit her hard. Williams had five aces, hit 21 winners and
fired off serves in excess of 110 mph. It was the most one-sided loss
Davenport has taken since returning to the circuit late last month
after being out since November because of an injured right knee and
subsequent surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could go back to 2-2 and try and play that first set
again," Davenport said. "It happened so fast. It kept going and it
just kept getting worse and worse, like a nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   Williams has been there, too. She missed four months because of
tendinitis in both wrists two years ago and grew frustrated when she
returned during the clay-court season, especially after a
particularly one-sided loss at the Italian Open.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost to Jelena Dokic, 6-1, 6-2, and it was all I could do to
stay on the court," Williams said of her only loss to Dokic. "It was
hard."</TE>
<TE>   The one-sided nature of the night semifinal between Williams and
Davenport brought out the usual barbs. Late in the second set, one
fan yelled, "Give us our money back."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Williams, the coach and father of Venus, had something to
say, too. According to courtside photographers sitting near him, he
said, among other things, "You might as well go home" when Davenport
went to change rackets in the second set.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport said she didn't hear him, but she did pick up the other
spectator's words.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so silent and I was about to receive. What are you going
to do about fans?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, people that say that aren't the ones that ever take the
court or the field or a position. It is disappointing. If I was a fan
I would have wanted a better match too."</TE>
<TE>   The compelling, competitive semifinal turned out to be the first
one. The sixth-seeded Dokic of Yugoslavia had little time to
celebrate her first victory over Jennifer Capriati on Friday or to
prepare for her match Saturday afternoon against Kournikova. Dokic
managed to save two match points in the 10th game and defeated
Kournikova, 6-7 (6), 7-6 (2), 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   But don't ask the turnaround artist how she pulled this one off.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," she said, looking genuinely perplexed, and
exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-year-old was fried after the two-hour contest in the hot
sun. She talked about saving three or four match points. In fact, it
was two.</TE>
<TE>   On the first, Kournikova hit a backhand long, forced by Dokic's
powerful forehand down the line. Dokic erased the second when she hit
a strong first serve to the body and Kournikova hit a backhand return
out.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic carried her aggressive play into the tiebreaker and won it,
7-2, hitting two return winners to finish it off, and appearing to
greatly deflate Kournikova in the process. The third set lasted 21
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that was my chance because in the third I was really
tired," said Kournikova, still in search of her first tournament
title on the women's tour. "It took a lot out of me. It was really
tough to turn it around. Whenever she was down 5-4 and 6-5 [in the
second] for some reason she started playing more aggressively and I
was more passive. It was like changing the role."</TE>
<TE>   The pinpoint accuracy Dokic showed against Capriati was fleeting
Saturday. Her first-serve percentage was 56% for the match, dipping
to 47% in the second set. She had 12 double faults and no aces.</TE>
<TE>   Said Dokic: "Mentally, I'm a strong person. I usually play the key
points, the big points well. After a few match points, I was back
even. I told myself I had nothing to lose."</TE>

<KH>RASHIDI WHEELERA YEAR LATER</KH>
<HD>Test of Will</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Linda Will adheres to a simple routine each night before she falls
asleep. Resting her head on a pillow, she stares at two framed
photographs on her bedside nightstand: Rashidi Wheeler as a child;
Rashidi Wheeler as a young man.</LD>
<LD>   Depending on the day, those images elicit a range of emotions:
heartbreak, happiness, anger, dread.</LD>
<LD>   Mostly, she said, they serve as inspiration as she continues
working to gain additional safeguards for the health and welfare of
college athletes and improved oversight of teams.</LD>
<TE>   "Rashidi was someone who always had his arm around those who felt
discouraged, whether it was the neighborhood kid who was being picked
on or the teammate who had just been yelled at by the coach," Will
said. "He was against injustice and he did something about it. That's
why I know he would not want me to be quiet about his death.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the only thing I can do. I have to speak out every day I
can. I will expose how my son died and I will make sure this doesn't
happen to the other Rashidis out there. There are a lot of them."</TE>
<TE>   One year ago Saturday, Wheeler, a senior strong safety at
Northwestern University, collapsed while trying to complete a
rigorous set of 28 conditioning sprints during a voluntary workout
drill. Wheeler, 22, a resident of Ontario and graduate of La Verne
Damien High, died upon arrival at Evanston (Ill.) Hospital. The Cook
County medical examiner ruled the death was a result of
exercise-induced bronchial asthma.</TE>
<TE>   The family's wrongful death lawsuit against the university is
proceeding toward a trial that lawyers say might not occur for two
more years.</TE>
<TE>   The university's attorneys contend Wheeler's use of
ephedrine-containing supplements Xenadrine and Ultimate Punch before
the intense drill led to his death.</TE>
<TE>   "The body of medical literature and knowledge is becoming more
encouraging regarding the association of ephedrine and adverse health
effects," said Eric Quandt, a Northwestern attorney who has named
three companies that make and distribute Xenadrine and Ultimate Punch
as third-party defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Will, a retired California Youth Authority correctional officer,
insists her son's death was caused by flawed and slow medical
attention during a workout that was a blatant violation of NCAA
rules.</TE>
<TE>   She has hired attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. and his Chicago-based
partner Jim Montgomery to handle the legal details of the suit, which
could net Wheeler's family millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning that case would tell Northwestern, 'No one believes your
lies,' " Will said. "Northwestern wishes this would just go away.
Well, I wish it had never happened."</TE>
<TE>   In the year since Wheeler's death, Will said she has also become
convinced the NCAA is an ineffective enforcer of rules and too
reactionary in its policymaking--opinions first raised in the days
after Wheeler's death by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a Wheeler family
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Will said she has written a one-page letter requesting
intervention in the form of congressional legislation. She said her
letters were mailed Friday to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Sen.
Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.)</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery describes Will's pursuit of reforms as a crusade.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sincere effort to effect changes," Montgomery said.
"She has created a Web site. She is preparing to contact people in
Congress. She has been vocal in the media. She doesn't only want
justice in the lawsuit, she wants major changes within the NCAA."</TE>
<TE>   Will is most upset about the NCAA's decision not to additionally
punish Northwestern after the university's self-imposed penalty of
six forfeited practices for its violation of timing and filming the
drill in which Wheeler died. Northwestern players reported there were
consequences to not finishing the voluntary drill. If they didn't
complete it in the designated amount of time, they would have to
perform it again during two-a-day official workouts in Kenosha, Wis.
Northwestern Athletic Director Rick Taylor instructed Coach Randy
Walker to discontinue the drill.</TE>
<TE>   "The NCAA is unable or unwilling to bring serious sanctions
against schools that commit major violations like this," Will said.
"We need fear of reprisal among college administrators and coaches.
If a school can self-govern, self-impose and self-sanction, that is
no sanction.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I have to go to the government on this. We're not
talking about a player being given a free bag of groceries or some
cash in his pocket. We're talking about the loss of a life."</TE>
<TE>   NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said the organization would not
welcome government intervention, calling it "unprecedented." She said
the NCAA is equipped to respond to safety concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "These issues have always been topics on the table for our
football study oversight committee since it was formed in January
2001, and out-of-season conditioning, because of its nature, is
always a topic being looked at by this association," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Wheeler died following what was described as a chaotic
practice-field scene. A field telephone was inoperable. He received a
misdiagnosis of hyperventilation and was told to breathe into a
plastic bag. The drill continued as trainers, then paramedics, tended
to him.</TE>
<TE>   Will wants mandatory safety standards instituted, including
practice fields equipped with working telephones, oxygen tanks,
several water stations and adequate medical supervision.</TE>
<TE>   "We need an unbiased body to step in where the NCAA has
demonstrated it won't," Will said. "I have frustration in that I
don't know who to go to about this, and I think any other parent
would feel the same way. I really do think I'll be successful on
this. I think a lot of other people feel this way."</TE>
<TE>   Florida State linebacker DeVaughn Darling and Florida freshman
running back Eraste Autin also died following practice-field
collapses last year. The NCAA board of directors approved a measure
in April allowing incoming freshmen to participate with returning
players in voluntary practices, which are typically coordinated by
strength and conditioning coaches and trainers. Previously, the
incoming freshmen, like Autin, participated in separate practices and
were supervised only for safety reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds has reported that the NCAA
football issues committee is considering reducing the number of
summer and two-a-day practices.</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern junior running back Jason Wright said he and
teammates have been given NCAA-approved literature providing
information on issues such as the dangers of health supplements and
heatstroke and the importance of hydration.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll bet you they'll have plenty of water out there this summer,
and that would be pleasing to Rashidi--that he is helping people even
in death," Will said. "This is the responsibility I owe to Rashidi,
and it's one I plan on honoring."</TE>
<TE>   Waging such a public campaign during a grieving process has been
burdensome, said Will, who still resides in Rashidi's boyhood home in
Ontario with her youngest son, 14-year-old Hershel Will. He plans to
play football this fall as a freshman at Damien.</TE>
<TE>   It has been an eventful year for Will.</TE>
<TE>   She fired Cochran and Montgomery and temporarily united with
Chicago attorney Larry Rogers, then rehired her original attorneys
four months later. Montgomery said Will thought his firm had erred by
permitting her ex-husband, George Wheeler, to become a
co-administrator of Rashidi's estate. She has called George Wheeler
"a deadbeat dad," a charge he has denied.</TE>
<TE>   Will expressed blunt judgments about Walker, Taylor and
Northwestern President Henry Bienen. She said all three should be
dismissed: Walker because of brutal coaching methods, Taylor and
Bienen because of their support for Walker. Will also said she
believes it is suspicious that Tory Aggeler, Northwestern's head
trainer, has resigned, although Aggeler said he left for a more
lucrative position as owner/operator of an athletic
training/rehabilitation center in Durango, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good about what I did that day [of Wheeler's death],"
Aggeler said. "The tragedy of this would be to allow that to affect
any decision in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Walker, who coached the Wildcats to a share of the Big Ten
Conference championship in 2000 before a 4-7 showing last year, is
said by Bienen to have strong job security.</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern spokesmen refused to comment about any issue related
to the Wheeler case. Quandt, the university lawyer, said, "I've got a
lot of respect for someone [like Will] who has suffered that kind of
loss. The ending to this story will come through litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Will said she has been contacted by several Northwestern players
and faculty members who demand changes. She said one letter written
anonymously by someone she believes to be a player said, "Don't get
tired in your good cause."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'll ever get over the fact there were so many
people there who could have helped Rashidi, and so few did," Will
said. "The way he died--that he was frightened, that he
suffered--there's no getting over that. There's no closure.</TE>
<TE>   "When I close my eyes for good, there'll be closure."</TE>
