<LD>The new Warner Bros. vampire film "Queen of the Damned" grossed $14.8
million to debut atop the weekend box office chart. The studio had to
grapple with how to market the film after the death of the film's
young female star, Aaliyah. The singer died in a plane crash last
year.</LD>
<LD>   "Certainly, there was heightened interest in the film due to her
appearance in the film, but I don't think that is why it was No. 1,"
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box-office tracking firm
Exhibitor Relations. "Horror films, in general, are solid draws at
the box office. They are really review-proof."</LD>
<LD>   "John Q.," starring Denzel Washington, dropped to second place in
its second week in release, taking in $12.5 million, while the
supernatural love story "Dragonfly," starring Kevin Costner, opened
in third place with $10.2 million.</LD>

<HD>Opera's Renee Fleming Delivers Vocal Thrills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The gifted and magnetic Renee Fleming gave her second recital at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Sunday night, this one under the auspices
of Los Angeles Opera, and thrilled a hall full of enthusiastic fans.
Her program was varied, and she had strong support from pianist
Richard Bado.</LD>
<LD>   The American soprano charmed with singing that is expressive and
often beautiful, limpidly phrased and cannily communicative. Her high
notes can flirt with inconsistency and sometimes emerge strident, but
are usually handsome. Occasionally, her words lack complete
enunciation, yet her musicality carries her through.</LD>
<LD>   She began and ended the program proper most ravishingly, opening
with a Handel aria, "Di, cor mio," from "Alcina," an object lesson in
trilling and bell-like ornamentation, and closing with an impassioned
group of four Rachmaninoff songs, in Russian. In between, there was
an authoritative group of Richard Strauss songs, Debussy's nuanced
"Chansons de Bilitis" and three wondrous Emily Dickinson songs by
Fleming's friend Andre Previn. Just before intermission, she sang "Un
bel di," from Puccini's "Madama Butterfly," preceded by a clever
arrangement of the pop standard "Poor Butterfly," made by another
friend of the soprano, jazz composer Dave Grusin.</LD>
<TE>   Her encores were the "Magic" aria from Previn's "A Streetcar Named
Desire"; Rachmaninoff's "Spring Waters"; Puccini's "O mio babbino
caro"; Duke Ellington's "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That
Swing)"; and Marietta's Song from Korngold's "Die Tote Stadt."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Renee Fleming sings this same recital at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, March 17
at 2 p.m. $25-$65. (714) 556-ARTS.</TE>

<HD>This Cow's a Ham</HD>
<DH>Chad Kimball, 25, moved from understudy to leading bovine
and is now stealing scenes in the Broadway-bound musical revival
'Into the Woods.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the new Broadway-bound production of "Into the Woods" at the
Ahmanson Theatre, actor Chad Kimball plays a cow.</LD>
<LD>   Go ahead and snicker. Kimball's already heard all the jokes: He's
udderly amazing, outstanding in his field, milks the role for all
it's worth, turns in a moo-ving performance.</LD>
<LD>   Keeping a conversation with the 25-year-old Kimball pun-free calls
for the same sort of massive restraint required of Kimball's
supportive parents back home in Seattle upon discovering that the
tuition money they shelled out for their son's Boston Conservatory
education might as well have been spent on a trip to a dairy farm.</LD>
<TE>   After all, this is not just a guy who plays a cow but a guy who,
until just before the show opened, was an udderstudy--understudy,
understudy--for a cow.</TE>
<TE>   Kimball was the offstage "cover" actor for Milky-White, the bovine
friend of the dimwitted Jack as in "Jack in the Beanstalk," one of
the fairy tales twisted into the "Into the Woods" story. Now, this
former understudy is on his way to becoming Broadway's first Cud
Stud.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a little silly, because I come out in a cow suit [for the
curtain call] and I get a huge round of applause," Kimball says
humbly.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the actors said: 'You know, I don't know if I can follow
that cow onstage every day.' But everybody in the cast has been
great."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1987 Broadway production of "Into the Woods," the cow was
an inanimate statue that could be carried on- and offstage. Not
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   The new, improved Milky-White is aged and forlorn, with melting
dark eyes and sagging skin of that same ashen shade E.T. turned when
it appeared he might never phone home again.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the hapless characters in this fairy tale gone mad,
Milky-White seems the one most truly horrified at being trapped in
the emotionally complex woods of this Stephen Sondheim musical.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 'stricken' is a really good word for Milky-White," muses
costume designer Susan Hilferty, who created the cow's pained
expression. "It's like: 'Oh my God, it's always bad news.'</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like a dog look to the face," Hilferty continued in a
telephone conversation from New York City, where she has returned to
work on several new projects and where she is chairwoman of the
design program at New York University. "I finally chose this cow from
my herd of cows because when I did the sketch, the face was so
hang-doggy, so stricken, it made your heart break."</TE>
<TE>   Before settling on the look of Milky-White, Hilferty, who also
designed the pigs, wolves and other animals for the production, went
through multiple cow designs: two-person cows, cows on wheels, cows
with no back end, cows with costumed bodies but human faces. There
were so many variations that she is considering a gallery exhibition
of all the sketches and mock-ups that went into the design process.</TE>
<TE>   "Into the Woods" director James Lapine takes credit for the idea
of bringing the formerly inanimate cow to life, though he adds that
he was inspired by other "Into the Woods" productions that have
presented a vaudeville-style two-person cow: one playing the head,
the other starring as the hindquarters. Hilferty ran with the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I really felt that it was necessary to understand this world,
this strange world where animals could talk or get possessed; they
seemed to have a kind of special power," she says. "It seemed
important that the animals have very distinct personalities."</TE>
<TE>   Although her costumes for the fairy tale's wolves and pigs allow
the human face to show, Hilferty ultimately decided that approach was
inappropriate for Milky-White because, unlike the other animals,
Milky-White has no songs. The plan was to have two women cast
members, Jennifer Malenke and Kate Reinders, alternate as
Milky-White. Both were also understudying major roles and had smaller
onstage roles to play on the nights they were not on cow duty. But
that proved to be a struggle for the slightly built actresses.</TE>
<TE>   In the costume, the actor dons a unitard with pieces of cow
"cartilage" attached to it. The performer's arms are holding
crutches, with hoofs at the bottom, to simulate the cow's front legs.
A loose-fitting fabric suit is then pulled on over the bits and
pieces, creating a sort of droopy skin over the whole. "We were
calling it the Shar-Pei cow for a time, because of this oversized
suit," Hilferty says.</TE>
<TE>   The cow's head and neck attach to the costume via a shoulder
harness. The cow's neck is made of a coil covered in fabric, which
moves like a Slinky to allow flexibility and allows the actor to see
out. The actor's head is actually behind the neck and cow head,
rather than inside it. To manipulate the cow's expressive face--blink
the eyes, move the ears or graze--one arm must be taken out of a
front leg and moved up into the head.</TE>
<TE>   During rehearsals, the women did fine with the costume. But that
changed once they put on the facemask. The head and neck are
lightweight, but working with the crutches, as well as balancing on
one crutch while moving the face levers with the other arm, requires
a certain degree of upper-body strength and stamina. The cowgirls
began to get the blues. One day, during technical rehearsals, Kimball
was asked to step in, and he was so immediately comfortable inside
the cow he was asked to remain there on a permanent basis.</TE>
<TE>   If there exists a certain ignominy to being cast as a cow, imagine
this for the resume: "Fired as a cow, Ahmanson Theatre, 2002." But
Lapine reports that the actresses are more relieved than distressed
and have plenty to keep them busy in other onstage and understudy
roles. And there's a domino effect in all the casting: Kimball is
also covering the major roles of Jack and Rapunzel's Prince; if one
of those actors cannot perform, Kimball takes over and the udders,
others, fill in as Milky-White.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, physically, it hasn't proven to be too strenuous," says
Kimball, a beaming, boyish sort who appears to have the appropriately
burly chest and arms for cow duty. "When you see someone fall
onstage, or in a situation where they are wearing something that
looks painful, you can't really let yourself enjoy it. My hope is to
be able to get across that it doesn't hurt whatsoever when it's on,
it's actually quite enjoyable to do and I have a lot of freedom.
Thank goodness it's not a jackrabbit or something that has to move a
lot. A cow usually just kind of sits and stares."</TE>
<TE>   "We try to make it as seamless as possible," Kimball adds.
"Obviously the audience knows that there's a person in there, but we
want to try to take them to a place where they forget a little bit
and are able to come away thinking, wow, that looked like a real
cow." Yes, but what's his motivation? "It's virtually the same as if
I didn't have a cow's head on," Kimball observes. "A lot of timing
goes into playing the cow--when to turn the head is so important, the
comic timing of doing a double-take as a cow. It must seem pretty
funny backstage to see me pulling my cow's head off, saying: 'Oh, I'm
just off tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his youth, Kimball's face has appeared on Broadway before,
though audiences still may not have noticed his visage. Nine days
before graduation from the Boston Conservatory in 1999, he appeared
in the Broadway production of Frank Wildhorn's "The Civil War." Other
credits include ensemble roles in "Sweeney Todd" in 1999 at the
Signature Theatre and the 30th anniversary off-Broadway revival of
"Godspell" in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Some actors might not consider playing a cow exactly a star turn.
But in this production, the cow has become the talk of the town,
mentioned by critics and audience members alike as a memorable part
of the show--even though the actor's face is seen only briefly during
the curtain call.</TE>
<TE>   Though he acknowledges the mild absurdity of answering the cattle
call, Kimball finds challenge in discovering the tragicomic soul of
Milky-White. Some young actors might be concerned about the lack of
exposure that comes from being hidden in a cow suit, especially in
L.A., during pilot season. Forget that guest part on "Friends."</TE>
<TE>   But Kimball remains devoted to the role. He even pays homage to
the cow's femininity. "I call her Madame White," he says. "I even do
a tiny curtsy-bow at the end. I actually can't bend over, because my
udder is too big.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the fun thing for me is to reflect Jack's personality,
since they are the best of friends--as Jack says, his best friend in
the whole world," Kimball continues.</TE>
<TE>   "The cow obviously thinks that himself. And I'm trying to reflect
his kind of dimwitted nature but at the same time--it feels really
funny, talking about this--this is an old cow who has been through
the ringer, who has known Jack since he was a baby. She has this kind
of ... edge.</TE>
<TE>   "And by edge I mean an edge with the audience. James Lapine and I
have talked about a couple of moments in the show where the cow can
break the fourth wall and really look out to the audience as the
Narrator [John McMartin] does."</TE>
<TE>   This cow describes himself as a ham, and Kimball admits he's had
discussions with Lapine about how far an actor should go in the role
when portraying livestock. "I was talking to him the other day, and
he had given me a note not to react on a certain line. I just
couldn't abide it. I said: 'Is there any way we could put in just a
small reaction there?" Kimball says. "And he said yes. So we go back
and forth."</TE>
<TE>   Even though he's on the other end of a telephone line, one can
almost see Lapine's eyes rolling when he is asked about this.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah," he says. "You never know what's going to happen, and
the audience just ate up the cow, so to speak, and meanwhile, we were
trying to tell a story. So I just had to be careful about where the
cow lived and where the cow was just basically background.</TE>
<TE>   "He's incredibly good, this kid. He's an incredibly resourceful
cow. He really made it a character immediately. That was the good
news. The hard news was, sometimes it was not the cow's scene."</TE>
<TE>   Lapine left the cow's true character to Kimball. "It's like you
would direct a dance role: You're tired here, you're gonna die there,
stick your arm out and reach for him here.</TE>
<TE>   "There are definitely directors who would get into sort of cow
subtext, but that's not my style. I don't generally direct that way.
I'm not an Actors Studio kind of guy.</TE>
<TE>   "Besides, I'm from the Midwest. We know our bovines."</TE>

<HD>Al Jarreau Playfully Juggles His Many Personas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Any time Al Jarreau turns up at a large, middle-of-the-road venue
such as the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, there's always a
bit of uncertainty about which of his various musical personas will
arrive on stage. Will it be the Jarreau one sees at his pure jazz
gigs--a brilliantly imaginative vocal improviser? Or will it be the
smooth-jazz hit-maker? Will it be Jarreau, the musical trickster,
ever in search of a bit of spontaneous humor? Or, perhaps, the master
of presentation and timing, able to convince an audience to let go of
its inhibitions via all-join-in sing-alongs?</LD>
<LD>   In his Sunday afternoon appearance at Cerritos, he managed to
bring along all those transformations, and more. Opening with a
lively rhythmic sequence (including the fun a cappella number,
"Puddit," from his recent album "Tomorrow Today") and tossing in a
high-spirited romp through "Take Five," he was the jazz Jarreau,
investing every phrase with upbeat rhythmic swing.</LD>
<TE>   It didn't take long for him to move on to the smooth-jazz hits,
however, with numbers such as "So Good," "After All," "Tomorrow
Today," "High Crime" and "Since I Fell for You" filling most of the
performance space. Irrepressible humor and audience engagement
followed, manifestations of Jarreau's utter sense of comfort in
performance. The easygoing sense of irreverent fun he
communicated--reminiscent at times of the high jinks of the
Sinatra/Martin/Davis Jr. Rat Pack--embraced his musicians, as well as
his listeners, resulting in a program in which even the more mundane
material surfaced in appealing fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Jarreau, in other words, did what he has been doing for
years--manage the difficult balancing act of remaining firmly in
touch with his roots as an accomplished, inventive jazz artist, while
still paying the commercial dues that generate the rewards associated
with the pop music world. At his best, he is a marvelous creator of
sound and rhythm, using his flexible voice, extraordinary pitch range
and a jazz instrumentalist's feel for swing at every possible
opportunity; and in this concert, he was consistently at his best.</TE>
<TE>   Capping the program, Jarreau added--apparently at the last
minute--a touching rendition of "God Bless America," beautifully
harmonized by keyboardist Freddie Ravel. Asking the overflow crowd to
join him in singing a work that was really a "prayer," Jarreau
employed his admirable creative sensitivity to transform its familiar
words into a moving anthem for peace.</TE>

<LD>Mary Martin is such a colorful figure around the country musical
capital that it's a tossup whether the first thing you'll hear about
the record executive is that she once managed Leonard Cohen and Van
Morrison or that she once punched out a loudmouth in a music club.</LD>
<LD>   Wes Vause, director of media marketing for the RCA Nashville
label, can fill you in about the latter.</LD>
<LD>   "I had just started as an intern here when Mary stopped me in the
hall and introduced herself by telling me about the time she couldn't
hear the music in a club because this woman behind her was talking so
loud," Vause recalls.</LD>
<TE>   "Mary said she asked the woman to be quiet, but it didn't help. So
Mary turned around again and said, 'Would you please just shut up.'
When she realized the woman wasn't going to stop talking, Mary just
turned around and decked her."</TE>
<TE>   Martin's music credentials are equally striking.</TE>
<TE>   Besides helping singer-songwriter Cohen get his first record
contract and then introducing Bob Dylan to the Band in the '60s, she
managed Morrison briefly and signed Emmylou Harris to Warner Bros.
Records in the '70s. She also worked closely with Clint Black and
Lorrie Morgan at RCA Nashville in the late '80s. Other acts she's
managed or worked with along the way range from Vince Gill to cult
favorite Rodney Crowell.</TE>
<TE>   Given those credentials, it's hard to imagine that Martin spent
most of the last decade on the sidelines here, at least partially a
victim of sexism in male-dominated country music, many believe.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, everyone talked about the old boys network in town and
about how young blood would change things as far as sexism, but in
many ways it's just turned into a new boys network," says Holly
Gleason, a leading Nashville publicist whose clients include Brooks &amp;
Dunn, Patty Loveless and Kenny Chesney.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is Mary Martin is the best at what she does, and that's
sometimes the worst thing that can happen in Nashville, because when
you have strong opinions about what you should be doing at a label,
it makes lots of other people uneasy--especially if you are a woman."</TE>
<TE>   But Martin is back on the scene in a big way after co-producing a
Hank Williams tribute album that goes into Wednesday's Grammy
ceremonies with five nominations. "Timeless," on Mercury Nashville,
is up for best country album; Sheryl Crow and Lucinda Williams are
nominated for female country vocal and Ryan Adams and Johnny Cash are
nominated for male country vocal for their contributions to the
collection.</TE>
<TE>   Her work on the project led to her being named vice president of
artists and repertoire at Mercury Nashville Records. Even if
"Timeless" is shut out Wednesday night, its success has reestablished
Martin as a key figure in the music industry here, a reminder that
it's not just artists who are bolstered by Grammy recognition. Record
executives too can benefit.</TE>
<TE>   No one is happier than Martin.</TE>
<TE>   She's so pleased to be back in the business that she seems to be
floating on air as she strides into her office at Mercury Nashville
Records in the heart of Music Row. She's been at the label for
months, but her office walls are still bare, a rarity in a business
where platinum albums and celebrity photos are the rule. When a
photographer stops by to take her picture, he has to take her across
the hall to find an interesting backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   Martin is just too busy to bother with her surroundings, and she's
so enthusiastic about her work that her eyes frequently twinkle while
she talks about favorite artists or songs. The only sign that someone
actually uses the office is the pile of tapes and discs, the tools of
the music trade, on her desk. Co-workers stop by regularly for a dose
of Martin's enthusiasm the way others might turn to a morning cup of
coffee.</TE>
<TE>   As vice president of A&amp;R, Martin searches for new artists and
works with publishers and producers to find songs for the label's
singers.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole 'Timeless' project gave me enormous amounts of joy,"
she says. "It truly validates my ability to deliver something that is
of merit, and it means that I get a chance to exercise my opinions
again, a chance to be passionate again about music that I love."</TE>
<TE>   The Canada native has loved songwriting ever since the mid-'60s.
She fell so in love with such Leonard Cohen songs as "Bird on the
Wire" and "Suzanne" that she went into the management business just
so she could work with him.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went into the business, people said I was too young," she
says, closing the office door to stop the stream of cohorts. "People
would also say, 'You're not a musician or a songwriter. Why do you
think you know anything about music?' Well, I knew my instincts were
good and I knew I cared passionately about music."</TE>
<TE>   After working in A&amp;R at Warner Bros. Records for much of the '70s,
Martin moved to RCA, where she did the same job. She and the label
severed ties as part of some executive changes around 1991. While she
was trying to figure out her next move, tragedy struck. Martin was
raped by an intruder in her home, and it took time to mend
emotionally. As part of that process, she became active in a victims'
rights organization.</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of rape, your spirit is murdered, and it's important
to learn that if you don't talk about it, you don't heal," Martin
says. "After I got involved in programs that offer counsel for rape
victims, I called on a lot of my pals in the music industry to sing
at some of our events, and they responded. Vince Gill was always at
my side, along with Gretchen Peters and Kim Richey and Patty
Loveless. It was an amazing period."</TE>
<TE>   It's likely that if a male former executive had gone through some
trauma, such as drug rehab, his colleagues would rally around him and
find him a new job. But Martin was virtually forgotten by the
industry for much of the decade.</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't waste time speculating on how much of a role sexism
might have played in it or how much her outspoken manner, or ageism,
may have contributed to the lack of offers before Luke Lewis,
chairman of Mercury Nashville Records, signed her last year. And
there is lingering sensitivity about the age issue.</TE>
<TE>   "No," she says sharply when asked to tell her age.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when women over 30 routinely declined to give
their ages, but it's surprising when someone as sophisticated and as
successful as Martin does so today.</TE>
<TE>   Martin tries to make a joke of it: "Just say I'm 95." But it's a
serious point.</TE>
<TE>   When pressed, she refuses to budge. "I'm absolutely certain age
hurts you in the music business," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis approached Martin two years ago with the idea for a Williams
tribute album. He had done such an impressive job at Mercury
Nashville, where he was instrumental in launching the career of
Shania Twain, that he was rewarded last year with his own label. Lost
Highway, a joint venture with the Island Def Jam Music Group, is off
to an impressive start with "Timeless" and a roster that includes
critics' darlings Lucinda Williams, Ryan Adams and Willie Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis won added applause around town for his bringing Martin back
into the business.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't trying to be a good guy in hiring Mary," he says in a
separate interview. "The fact that she was a woman didn't have
anything to do with it. I just figured that anyone who signed Emmylou
Harris and worked with Van Morrison is someone I'd want on my team.
You don't lose that kind of great ear for talent.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I met her, she was like a breath of fresh air. I saw
her light up when we started talking about the Hank Williams album
and we started drawing up a wish list of the artists we wanted on it.
The more I saw of her, the more I realized I wanted to keep working
with her beyond this project. I wanted her to help me find new
artists."</TE>
<TE>   Like many women in country music, Renee Bell, vice president of
A&amp;R at RCA Nashville, cites Martin as a role model. "She has been a
huge inspiration for me because she signed or managed two of my
all-time favorite artists, Emmylou Harris and Vince Gill, and she
always had such devotion to her artists."</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Garner, who also co-produced "Timeless," has known Martin
since the days three decades ago when Martin was managing Morrison.</TE>
<TE>   "I love that she's back in the business," Garner says. "She is so
fiercely protective of her artists and their integrity, which is a
point every record company needs to remember."</TE>
<TE>   It's not just women who laud Martin. Tony Brown, co-founder of the
new Universal South label and an executive who has been considered
progressive in the hiring of women in Nashville, first met Martin
when he was playing piano in Harris' band in the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   "She was already a legend in my eyes because I had heard she had
put Dylan together with the Band, and she didn't let me down," says
Brown, who has signed or worked with such artists as Gill, Steve
Earle and George Strait.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned a lot from just watching her. The fact that Mary is
back in the music business is a significant step on several levels,
so it's great to see her work recognized at the Grammys. When Luke
hired her, some people were probably surprised because they think you
need someone young and on the cutting edge in A&amp;R, but Mary Martin
has always been on the cutting edge."</TE>

<HD>An Artist's Best Work, Figuratively Speaking</HD>
<DH>Elmer Bischoff began and ended his career as an abstract
painter. His strongest images date from the years between.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two dates separated by 20 years loom large in Bay Area painter Elmer
Bischoff's career, which is currently being surveyed at the Orange
County Museum of Art. One signaled a fresh beginning, the other was
more equivocal.</LD>
<LD>   The first date is 1952. Bischoff (1916-1991), following the lead
of his friend and colleague David Park, quit teaching at the
California School of Fine Arts that year and, more importantly, quit
making abstract paintings. He began to turn intuitive principles of
Abstract Expressionist painting toward figurative ends. Specific,
recognizable imagery now shared the pictorial stage with the
vigorous, independent life of an intensely painted surface. Hans
Hofmann merged with Edvard Munch in this surprising new work; Mark
Rothko met Pierre Bonnard.</LD>
<LD>   The second turning point came in 1972--although turning point may
be too narrow a term. Crisis of confidence is more like it. After two
decades, Bischoff was stuck.</LD>
<TE>   He, Park, Richard Diebenkorn and a few others had developed what
came to be called Bay Area Figurative painting in the 1950s. Promoted
as a spirited regional alternative to the lethargic second generation
of New York School abstraction, Bay Area Figurative painting had put
San Francisco briefly on the national art map. But the Pop, Minimal
and Conceptual art revolutions of the 1960s, which were centered in
New York and Los Angeles, yawned like a chasm that Bischoff could
neither ignore nor cross. After nearly 18 months of dire indecision,
he made an unexpected choice: He returned to abstract painting.</TE>
<TE>   In the Orange County show, organized by the Oakland Museum of
California, where it was seen last fall, those late abstractions
provide an uneasy coda to Bischoff's estimable career. Just eight
paintings sum up the 1970s and 1980s--half as many as chronicle the
extraordinary two-year period of 1957 and 1958, when Bischoff was
working at his peak. It isn't that the abstractions are bad; he was
too technically gifted a painter, especially with color, for that.
They just seem diffident and withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition is strongest in laying out Bischoff's strongest
work. Twenty-five of its 52 paintings date from the 1950s. They
include some of his finest pictures of bathers by the sea and women
in gardens, images whose subject matter merges seamlessly with his
lyrically improvisational paint handling and sensuous color.</TE>
<TE>   The subject matter is straightforward. The men and women who
populate Bischoff's figurative paintings are never individualized.
Typical are the "Two Figures at the Seashore" (1957), whose faces are
obscured by the harsh shadow of a sunlit afternoon on the Pacific.
These are not genre paintings, meant to realistically record social
activities at the beach or in the garden. Instead, recreation is
exactly that: an opportunity for re-creation.</TE>
<TE>   The subject of these paintings is Eden before the Fall, a lost
Golden Age, a mythic world of peace and harmony remote from (but
tethered to) the trauma of the everyday, which can only live in the
imaginative realm of art. It's the same subject that proved so
attractive to French painters at the turn of the 20th century, from
adventurous Modernists like Cezanne and Matisse to more conservative
painters like Puvis de Chavannes. Bischoff made paintings as a kind
of refuge. The anguished knowledge of loss finds reparation in an
inspired immersion in chromatic poetry.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition opens with three confident abstract paintings
dating from 1949 to 1952. They're helpful in showing Bischoff's
assimilation of Hofmann-style principles, in which the canvas is a
contested field of abstract pictorial forces that are intuitively
wrestled into dynamic repose. The first gallery also includes early
figurative works, where the influence of Munch and Toulouse-Lautrec
is plain. Bischoff had admired their paintings in 1951 retrospectives
at the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   What the show leaves out, though, is the generative impulse found
in Surrealist-inspired paintings like Rothko's pivotal "Slow Swirl at
the Edge of the Sea" (1944), which the San Francisco Museum of Art
acquired in 1946 after Rothko's solo exhibition there. The famous
picture, whose fragile abstract personages emerging from an ethereal
miasma suggested a mystically inclined ache for rebirth, was a
touchstone for many Bay Area artists. As the world shuddered through
the collective nervous breakdown of war and holocaust that made hash
of Enlightenment rationalism, they were scratching around in the
ashes of primal myth, searching for a new start.</TE>
<TE>   The Bischoff exhibition catalog, which includes excellent essays
by critic Bill Berkson and curator Susan Landauer, reproduces several
Bischoff paintings from 1947 whose affinity to the apocalyptic Rothko
canvas is clear. Abstract painting seemed the necessary avenue to
follow, and for several years he did. The sudden 1952 U-turn, led by
Park, coincided with a larger questioning of the primacy of abstract
art. (For a celebrated example, see the terrific show of Willem de
Kooning's Expressionist drawings of women, which rose to a crescendo
that year, currently at L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art.) That it
would take the form Bischoff's paintings did still seems unexpected:
The slow swirl by the edge of his sea gave birth to bathers.</TE>
<TE>   Bischoff's figures are never merely described by paint; instead,
they exist as the physical stuff of his paint-loaded brush strokes,
just as the interlocking forms in his abstractions do. When a shadow
falls across a woman's shoulder, it's a slather of magenta-blue-brown
paint colliding with a rising wave of red-ochre color. The highlight
on a cheek wells up from beneath dense surrounding layers of blue,
gray, green and violet. A yellow sky carves out the vivid blue
silhouettes of trees in a landscape.</TE>
<TE>   The technique, which was pushed to an extreme by Bischoff's most
celebrated student, Joan Brown, is like sculpting with paint in two
dimensions. Most of the classic works in the show also share a
loosely cruciform composition on a square (or almost square) canvas.
Stability is embodied. Color has physical weight and presence. The
result is an optical gravity.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, when Bischoff returned to abstraction, he still
approached paint (now acrylic, rather than oil) and color and canvas
in this material way. The late abstractions seem less like
improvisations than intuitive constructions. Broken fields of choppy
color have been worked and reworked, fussed over and goaded.
Generalized cosmology replaces the Golden Age iconography of his
figurative work--but the form feels stale.</TE>
<TE>   Art, of course, had undergone its own collective nervous breakdown
in the tumultuous 1960s, when possibilities for the future seemed
bleak. Painting took the brunt, because it was the archetype of what
art had been before. Artists turned to plastic, lead, felt,
rubber--every material under the sun except paint and canvas in
search of a way forward.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Bischoff's late abstractions seem hermit-like and
detached. In a real sense they were. Even now, at a time when
painting has ceased to be a controversial issue for new art, they
gesture in our direction from a faraway place.</TE>

<LD>   Migraines or Money Behind Standoff?</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for "Malcolm in the Middle" star Jane Kaczmarek on
Monday denied reports that the actress is involved in a salary
dispute that prompted her to walk off the set of the Fox comedy two
weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   A USA Today story said that the actress has been involved in a
standoff with Fox and Regency Television, which produces the hit
series, and that the show had scrapped plans to film the season's
remaining two episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Not so, said a spokeswoman for Kaczmarek, who chalked up the
absence to "short-term" health problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Jane Kaczmarek has been medically diagnosed as suffering from
severe migraine headaches and that they are extremely painful," she
said in a statement. "There is no connection between her health
issues and any contractual matters. The physician from Fox Studios
has examined Jane as well and has confirmed this diagnosis."</TE>
<TE>   Though executives from Regency and Fox declined comment, insiders
indicated that recent salary discussions have taken place between the
studios and representatives for the actress.</TE>
<TE>   No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service on 'Survivor'</TE>
<TE>   CBS' fourth installment of the "Survivor" series--shot on Nuku

<TE>   "We removed giving them any rice or anything," said the show's
executive producer, Mark Burnett. "We always wanted to do that, but
the other [locations] didn't allow us. Here, there were plenty of
fish in the ocean, there were fruits in the trees and even
vegetables, if you went far enough. They have to forage to eat
anything, therefore it becomes more of a meritocracy."</TE>
<TE>   The first episode of "Survivor: Marquesas" airs Thursday at 8 p.m.</TE>

<TE>   Premature Reports of Her Retirement</TE>
<TE>   Celine Dion's "retirement" from the concert stage officially comes
to an end after two years with a Sunday show at the Kodak Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Dion will sing tracks from "A New Day Has Come," her album
scheduled for April release, and Destiny's Child will perform as
special guests. Though the performance is for an upcoming CBS
special, a limited number of $20 seats will be made available
beginning today by phone from Ticketmaster.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian singer, one of the most successful commercial forces
in music in the past decade, stepped away from her touring career to
devote time to family, but soon returns in a major way: She recently
agreed to perform five nights a week for three years at Caesar's
Palace in Las Vegas, beginning next year--a pact that reportedly will
earn her $100 million.</TE>

The prizes are regarded as the British equivalent of the Oscars.</TE>

<HD>Ma's the Life of This Birthday Party</HD>
<DH>The cellist turns in zesty performances of pieces by John
Williams at an L.A. Philharmonic concert toasting the composer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a debate going on as to whether classical musicians should
show more involvement when they play. One side feels that audiences
would relate better to the music if they did. Classical music might
even become more popular. The other side feels that music should be
left to speak for itself, without any enhancement of personality.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone watching cellist Yo-Yo Ma play on the Los Angeles
Philharmonic's "John Williams: A 70th Birthday Celebration" concert
Sunday afternoon at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion would have had no
doubt about the issue.</LD>
<LD>   Ma's involvement with music was so intense, so happy and so
luminous that it almost didn't matter what he was playing. His joy in
making music reached out to the audience, back to the orchestra and
over to Williams on the podium.</LD>
<TE>   He played Williams' music with heart and with subtlety, with
energy and with commitment, whether it was the Cello Concerto written
for him in 1993, two pieces from the 1999 film "Angela's Ashes,"
"Elegy" for Cello and Orchestra (1997-2001) or two sections
("Rosewood" and "Pickin' ") of Three Pieces for Solo Cello (2000).</TE>
<TE>   Ma savored every melodic line and each climatic moment. Even when
he wasn't playing, he seemed to be riding a wave created by the other
musicians and telegraphed his happiness to them.</TE>
<TE>   The all-Williams concert, a benefit for the Musicians Pension
Fund, fell into two parts, each showing a different side of the
composer. People coming to the sold-out program expecting to hear his
film music had to wait until the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The first half was devoted to Williams' serious concert music.
That included "For Seiji!"--composed for Seiji Ozawa and the Boston
Symphony--and the Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, two pieces in
tune with 20th century trends in music. You could hear stylistic and
structural antecedents as honorable and as disparate as Bartok,
Webern and Vaughan Williams in both works.</TE>
<TE>   John Williams' film music is a distillation of the same approach
actually. Whether for "Angela's Ashes" or the inspirational White
House-commissioned "American Journey," it's music more complex than
first greets the ear. There can be a certain harmonic and melodic
frustration, or indeterminacy, to it. It strives for an endless
melody, and that allows short-term goals to be reached, making for
memorable themes and motifs, but long-term goals prove more elusive.
Things don't end where you'd expect them to. The music concludes; it
doesn't arrive at a perfect resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Only one part of the concert had any film accompaniment. That was
"American Journey," a selection of three of six segments of pictorial
music made for Steven Spielberg's "The Unfinished Journey," a film
created at the request of then-President Clinton and First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and given its premiere at the Lincoln Memorial
on New Year's Eve 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In the lineage of Copland's "A Lincoln Portrait" and his 1939
educational documentary "The City" (two other works for narrator and
orchestra), the Spielberg film tracks American history. The three
segments seen Sunday were "Immigration and Building," "Civil Rights
and the Women's Movement" and "Flight and Technology," and Williams'
music mostly served to underline each image; when airplanes take
flight, the music ascends right along with them. Alfre Woodard and
Paul Winfield were the dramatic narrators of texts by Rita Dove,
Robert Pinsky, Maya Angelou, Carl Sandburg, Abraham Lincoln and
Martin Luther King Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Williams led the flying theme from "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"
as the single encore. Then the orchestra surprised him by playing
"Happy Birthday," reinforced by the audience.</TE>

<HD>Dramas That Mirror Our Lives</HD>
<DH>Films such as 'Lantana' and 'In the Bedroom' pack a punch
because their families mimic our own flawed relationships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY SELBY</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Say what you will about well-written murder mysteries and suspenseful
thrillers; for truly excruciating tension, there's nothing like
watching a relationship unravel.</LD>
<LD>   Icy silences. Seething resentments. Broken promises. Public
slights. These keep me on the edge of my seat in theaters or turning
the pages of books. For pure stress, wondering whodunit simply can't
compare to worrying about the husband-wife, father-son or
mother-daughter relationship that's disintegrating in front of me.</LD>
<LD>   Recently, I watched two well-crafted films in which the
relationships slowly fray and twist in the chill wind of familiarity
and contempt. "Lantana" takes its name from a flowering bush armed
with treacherously tangled and thorny branches. Set in Sydney,
Australia, the film tells the stories of four couples as wounding and
intertwined as the plant.</LD>
<TE>   Sonja (Kerry Armstrong) is trying to rekindle the passion in her
marriage to Leon (Anthony LaPaglia), a policeman in midlife crisis,
by forcing him to take dance lessons.</TE>
<TE>   But Leon is having an affair with a woman who has recently left
her husband. Valerie (Barbara Hershey) is Sonja's therapist, whose
own marriage to John (Geoffrey Rush) is crumbling in the aftermath of
their daughter's death. John simmers with hurt, unable to reconcile
his wife's method of dealing with grief with his own.</TE>
<TE>   Almost no one in this movie seems able to connect with his or her
spouse until the end--and for at least one couple, that's too late.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Bedroom" is just as painful. Grief is the disease that
threatens to overcome a marriage between the middle-class New England
husband and wife after a tragedy that involves their 21-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   The film unfolds slowly, following Ruth (Sissy Spacek) and Matt
(Tom Wilkinson) day by day--to the choral lessons Ruth teaches, to
Matt's medical office, to the store and to bed, as life grinds on.
Each day is filled with stony silences and miscues until, finally,
husband and wife turn on each other.</TE>
<TE>   They ultimately come to a resolution of sorts, but one that never
will console them. By the end of the movie, I was exhausted, wrung
out by their pain and inability to comfort each other.</TE>
<TE>   These are rich, saddening and believable tales because they mimic
parts of our own complex and inevitably imperfect relationships.
These are our dreams and nightmares, our days and nights, our spouses
and parents and children. And these reflections of ourselves make for
the most powerful narratives--and sometimes the most agonizing.</TE>
<TE>   Tales such as these "are such a Rorschach for your own life," says
Charlotte Stoudt, dramaturge at Baltimore's Center Stage. "You have
to ask yourself what it is in your own life that makes this so
agonizing. 'Why am I afraid of this in my own life?'"</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 years after Arthur Miller wrote "Death of a
Salesman," the play, in which Willy Loman continually betrays his
wife and disillusions his sons, still has enormous resonance. In the
1999 Tony Award-winning revival, actors Brian Dennehy and Elizabeth
Franz portrayed the relationship between salesman and wife in
particularly torturous fashion. "I never want to be alone in the room
with that play again," Stoudt says.</TE>
<TE>   It's the ring of truth that elevates a play or book or film to the
level of great art. And it's that same truth that can make some works
nearly unbearable. Little wonder that I can watch Arnold
Schwarzenegger take out a slew of bad guys without flinching; I'm not
emotionally engaged. But I cringe during such movies as "Affliction,"
which stars James Coburn as a violent father and Nick Nolte as a son
who is just like him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   However painful, the battles, feuds and silences among those who
profess to love one another are endlessly fascinating. The themes are
the same, but the nuances can be infinite. It is as Russian novelist
Leo Tolstoy wrote in the first line of "Anna Karenina": "All happy
families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy in
its own way."</TE>
<TE>   "Conflict is the essence of plot, and conflict within the family
cuts close to the bone for all of us," says Sister Kathleen Feeley,
former president of the College of Notre Dame of Maryland, who
teaches 20th century American literature. Think Cain and Abel.
Macbeth. Ulysses.</TE>
<TE>   "Cain killed Abel, and the story is like a prototype for all the
ages," Feeley says. "From the beginning of time--before business
relationships, before outside friendships--familial relationships
have been with us. Our lives have been shadowed by myth, and these
myths often have conflicts stemming from familial relationships."</TE>
<TE>   Gut-wrenching. Heartbreaking. What more can I ask of a story?
Happiness, perhaps. But without the emotions, soul-searching and
angst that come with conflicts between people, these stories wouldn't
be recognizable as life. As Feeley says: "I can't think of any novel
that is about a happy family except Dick and Jane."</TE>

<HD>Stock 'Black Comedy' Furnishes Few Laughs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Shaffer's one-act "Black Comedy" is a paltry choice for a full
evening in the theater, and International City Theatre's revival does
little to alter that impression.</LD>
<LD>   As sculptor Brindsley Miller and his fiancee prepare for a party
in his London apartment, circa 1965, the lights go out--for the
characters, that is. For the audience in Long Beach's Center Theater,
the play begins in darkness, and the stage lights go on only when the
fictional lights go out.</LD>
<LD>   During the rest of the play, we see the characters stumbling
about, their "darkness" broken only when a character lights a
match--at which point the stage lights fade (Rand Ryan designed the
lighting). For complicated plot reasons, the matches are doused and
the stumbling resumes.</LD>
<TE>   The laughs result not only from the lighting, or lack of it, but
also from Brindsley's many needs. He's trying to impress his
fiancee's father and a rich German who might buy his art. So, without
asking, he has borrowed fancy furniture from a vacationing
neighbor--who returns unexpectedly. Also returning unexpectedly is
Brindsley's former girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the laughter never rides atop an irresistible wave. The first
part of the play passes without much mirth. Only when Brindsley
begins moving furniture back into his neighbor's apartment do the
chuckles begin to percolate.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Gourley's lithe Brindsley capably performs an intricate
balancing act with the furniture and the unexpected guests. The
unobserved return of his ex, Stacy Barnhisel, adds to the laughter.</TE>
<TE>   The other characters do their assigned shtick well enough. Tom
Dugan, as the would-be father-in-law, barks military jargon. Eileen
T'Kaye plays the sedate neighbor who gradually becomes sloshed. Karen
Stapleton is a ninny of a girlfriend, and Ted Barton is a swishy
stereotype as the neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   But no one escapes the feeling of stock characterizations. Maybe
this play has had its day. At least Bradley Kaye's set and Kim
DeShazo's costumes remind us of that day, injecting a merry dash of
mod mid-'60s color.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Comedy," Center Theater, Long Beach Performing Arts Center,
300 E. Ocean Blvd. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends
March 17. $27-$35. (562) 436-4610. Running time: 1 hour, 20 minutes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With 100 trillion cells built from 100 billion miles of DNA coding,
the human body has been called one of the world's most exquisite
machines. That machine's limits are always being pushed, whether it
be through in-vitro fertilization, for example, or innovative brain
surgery using 3-D imaging as a map.</LD>
<LD>   Now, a National Geographic special stretches the bounds of the
biological documentary, using dazzling digital effects along with the
stories of four groups of people to peer inside "The Incredible Human
Body" (9 tonight, PBS).</LD>
<LD>   Filmmakers Karen Goodman and Kirk Simon start with a chronicle of
conception, showing in-vitro fertilization at work for one couple,
step by microscopic step.</LD>
<TE>   Next, in a triple-overtime victory, the NBA's Charlotte Hornets
illustrate how extensive repetition rewires the brain for peak
performance, enabling the body to move with elegant precision.</TE>
<TE>   London cabbies, who study for years to gain an encyclopedic
familiarity with the city's twisting streets, exemplify how the
brain's memory sector can grow, boosting optimism for Alzheimer's
research.</TE>
<TE>   In the most intense sequence, Mayo Clinic doctors extricate a
massive brain tumor from a man who must stay awake throughout the
surgery. The slightest slip can impair the patient's speech or
movement--or worse--so the doctors must query him constantly to
monitor his cognitive responses.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, as a Johns Hopkins University researcher points out,
"We do not know what the human potential is. Everything we think is a
roadblock to what a human can do physically and mentally has been
proven to be wrong."</TE>
<TE>   In the best National Geographic tradition, "The Incredible Human
Body" evokes a sense of wonder and lives up to its title.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a typically frantic Saturday afternoon at the Costco in Culver
City. The parking lot was at a standstill, and crowds of harried
consumers pushed overloaded shopping carts. The only sign that
something was afoot was a TV camera crew huddled near the entrance.</LD>
<LD>   Then, cellist Yo-Yo Ma stepped from a sleek black sedan with
composer John Williams behind him. They studied their surroundings.
The two musicians had taken a break from rehearsing for their Sunday
night performance at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to promote "Yo-Yo
Ma Plays the Music of John Williams," a Sony Classical release.</LD>
<LD>   "I know this isn't what you're used to doing at a Costco," said
one member of the Sony Classical team. "But have a good time doing
it."</LD>
<TE>   Suddenly, a young voice pierced the crowd. "Cellists rock!" Ma
looked up to see a small boy in an oversized T-shirt with his fist in
the air. The cellist paused to offer a handshake and a smile. "I
agree with you," he said quietly.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding a corner, the two musicians spotted their fans. Hundreds
of people awaiting autographs and handshakes were lined up near
stacks of bestsellers, vacuum cleaners and household appliances.
(Event coordinators estimated that 2,000 people lined up for the
musicians during their two-hour appearance.) At the sight of Williams
and Ma, they broke into applause.</TE>
<TE>   House painter Greg Hanson, the first person in line, had driven in
from the Seattle area and arrived four hours early to get Williams to
sign a movie poster for "The Empire Strikes Back," the 1980 film that
Williams scored. Near the line's end, David Wertheimer, 14, carried a
Stradivarius he wanted Ma to autograph.</TE>
<TE>   "It has absolutely no value," he said, "but I decided to just have
it signed, probably just bring up the value." Costco's no Carnegie
Hall, but the Washington state-based members-only discount store is
one of the world's largest CD retailers, and the Culver City store is
the company's third busiest.</TE>
<TE>   That was enough to occasion Williams' first visit to the discount
chain. "This experience ... is all new to me," he said. "I've heard
of this institution, but I've never been anywhere near it. Amazing to

<TE>   Liza Minnelli and David Gest commandeered the Mondrian Hotel's
Skybar on Thursday night for a piano party and lavish dinner to
celebrate their recent engagement.</TE>
<TE>   A healthy crowd of media and autograph seekers turned out for the
event, but many of them were too young to recognize the famous
guests, who glittered on the A-list years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Former Andy Warhol Factory habitue Sally Kirkland was among the
most visible guests to stop for reporters. She donned a metallic gold
wrap and a vividly pattern skirt and carried an unwrapped engagement
gift for Minnelli: a small statue that appeared to be a Hindu
goddess. "I didn't get it at Tiffany's like I was supposed to," she
said. "[But] I thought she might like this for her collection. I
don't know which goddess it is, but I thought it might be a spiritual
blessing."</TE>
<TE>   Behind her, 1960s "it" couple Paula Prentiss and director Richard
Benjamin spoke fondly of Minnelli. "We've known them both a long
time," Benjamin told a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Dangerfield grew impatient when Minnelli and Gest were
fashionably late. "They'll be married three years by the time she
shows up!" a friend advised: "She's never been on time in her life!"</TE>
<TE>   As if on cue, the petite singer and her fiance emerged from the
press line. Both were decked all in black. It was well past sundown,
but Gest wore dark sunglasses. Minnelli was immediately enveloped in
hugs and kisses. "You look great!" floated on the crowd as they made
their way to their table, which was positioned in front of a small
stage and a baby grand piano.</TE>
<TE>   As guests ate dinner, R&amp;B vocalist James Ingram serenaded the
couple. Later, Minnelli took the stage and with characteristic flair
belted out "I Love a Piano" and "New York, New York."</TE>
<TE>   By 11 p.m. waiters were clearing dinner plates and the party was
winding down. Minnelli looked around, musing on the evening, and
summed it up in a word: "Sensational!"</TE>

<TE>   Appealing Verdict</TE>
<TE>   James Brown is considering an appeal of a jury's Wednesday verdict
that he must pay $40,000, which represents a year's salary, to his
former employee Lisa Ross Agbalaya for wrongfully terminating her
from her job managing the West Coast operations of James Brown
Enterprises Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Agbalaya's lawsuit demanded $2 million for sexual harassment,
emotional distress and wrongful termination, claiming that Brown
fired her after she refused his sexual advances. The jury cleared
Brown of sexual harassment.</TE>

<LD>THE SUMMONS</LD>
<LD>   By John Grisham</LD>
<LD>   Doubleday</LD>
<TE>   342 pages; $27.95</TE>
<TE>   John Grisham is at his best when he's plotting heavily, tossing
his characters into dire straits and then pulling out  the stops to
save them, all the while weaving in details of legal precedence, and
playing with the gray area between the letter of the law and its
spirit.</TE>
<TE>   His last two novels, though, took  different courses. "Skipping
Christmas," released just a few months ago, was an odd foray that
parodied the holiday spirit. A complete divergence in writing style
for Grisham, the tale disappointed those who turn to him for
high-octane thrills. Last year's "A Painted House," however,
succeeded. The book contained no lawyers  but put a heavy focus on
characterization and the quiet story development one finds in
literary novels. With the requisite murder and fast-paced plotting
to keep readers satisfied, the author explored deeper layers of the
human experience than he had previously.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps in writing these two deviations, Grisham has grown more
comfortable with his voice while expanding its range. In "The
Summons," he returns in all his Grisham glory, complete with lawyers
both good and bad, legal issues to be pondered and the delightful
suspense that keep us flipping the pages. The level of literary merit
Grisham brings to the tale, though, seems to have clicked up a notch.</TE>
<TE>   Set in the deep South, "The Summons" features law professor Ray
Atlee, a divorced, stalled-in-midlife lone wolf. Ray is summoned by
his father, the honorable Reuben Atlee--a  highly respected judge--to
return to his childhood home in Clanton, Miss., so  he can help the
judge straighten out his affairs.  Battling aggressive cancer, the
domineering judge wishes to clear up things between himself and his
two sons before he dies. Ray and his black-sheep brother Forrest, an
alcoholic/drug addict,  dutifully comply with their father's summons.</TE>
<TE>   Ray is the first to arrive and finds a number of surprises. His
father, who appears to be napping on the couch, is dead. There's a
brand-new will waiting on the desk. There's also, Ray discovers, more
than $3 million in cash hidden in  boxes in the judge's study.</TE>
<TE>   For a man who earned a modest salary as a public servant, Judge
Atlee couldn't have come by the money honestly. Or could he? Within
hours of this discovery, Ray realizes he's not the only one aware of
the treasure; someone else is after the money and plans to do
whatever's necessary to get it.</TE>
<TE>   The quandaries are many, and Grisham plays with our sense of
morality throughout. Should Ray tell his brother about the find, only
to watch Forrest--who proceeds to get drunk within minutes of
learning of his father's death--kill himself with  the cash?  Should
Ray, the estate's executor, include the money in the probate
proceedings, which would bring public scrutiny on the judge's
otherwise impeccable reputation? (Not to mention the inheritance
taxes that will eat up at least half of the funds.) Is the money
marked or counterfeit? And who is trying to get the fortune?</TE>
<TE>   What follows are Ray's intriguing machinations as he drives around
the South, trying to solve the mystery and escape his pursuers, in
his Audi TT roadster with the cash stuffed into trash bags and
crammed into his tiny trunk. In Grisham's great heart-pounding way,
"The Summons" explores issues of family dynamics (what it's like to
have a father who's highly respected in town but not much of a father
figure to his own sons), questions of alcoholism and drug dependency
within families (when is an addict beyond help?) and the effects of
sheer, untempered greed.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past few weeks," Grisham writes of Ray, "he had become
more curious about how much things cost, about what the money could
buy, about how it could grow if invested conservatively, or
aggressively." Soon Ray, who previously would have considered himself
immune to the lure of money, is sleeping in his car and eating in
fast-food dives so he can keep an eye on the roadster and its hidden
fortune.</TE>
<TE>   With "The Summons," Grisham has hit a pleasing midpoint between
the whodunit legal thriller and the more literary attempts of his
recent work. Here, his characters are three-dimensional and complex.
Fleshed out, working through mucky issues, they compel us in a way
that's relatively new for Grisham.</TE>
<TE>   The good guys aren't quite so unquestionably good, and the bad
guys are a little less clear-cut in their depravity. Yet there is
enough plot drive to satisfy even the most hard-core Grisham fan.</TE>
<TE>   "The Summons" is more than a long-awaited return to form; it marks
out the rich literary territory Grisham has begun to occupy.</TE>

<HD>Unstable World of Stock Market ... and the Ladies Who Play
It</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People who play the market are now at each other's throats. The Bulls
&amp; Tigers of Forest Hills, a ladies investment club of 10, meets every
month to play the stock market.</LD>
<LD>   This month the meeting was held at Jane Peters' house. The club
had made $20,000 in the year 2000, and while things went down in
2001, they could still barely hold their heads above water.</LD>
<LD>   When the going was good, they called themselves the Sunshine
Ladies because they couldn't lose as far as their investments were
concerned.</LD>
<TE>   The club rotated their brunch meeting among the members. When
times were good, they served smoked salmon from Alaska, Swedish
pancakes, eggs Mornay, apple turnovers and an assortment of Danish.
They were a happy sorority and talked of the club someday taking
their winnings for an all-expenses-paid trip to Venice, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   But that was in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Now you could tell that bitterness had seeped into the club.
Instead of the brunch goodies of the good years, Jane served each
member an unbuttered bagel and one cup of coffee.</TE>
<TE>   There were no jokes about face-lifts. Instead, their conversation
was spent only on their investments. Sylvia Glass said, "Dorothy
Sergeant made us buy Enron when it was $87 a share."</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy retorted, "How did I know they were keeping two sets of
books? Besides, Lucy Holzer said her husband, who was a security
analyst, said Enron could only go up."</TE>
<TE>   "If it was such a good buy, why did so many of its executives take
the Fifth Amendment?"</TE>
<TE>   "Wouldn't you after what the accountants did to the books?"</TE>
<TE>   Alice Gordon said, "Forget Enron. Who urged the club to buy Global
Crossing?"</TE>
<TE>   Janet Elstrom replied, "Edna Smithers did. She said she read in
the Buzz Street Journal that if you put all your 401(k) funds in
Global Crossing, you would never have to watch your pension again."</TE>
<TE>   Erica Stromberg said, "Then why did they go bankrupt?"</TE>
<TE>   Jane Peters answered, "They were supposed to lay optical wire
around the world. Instead, they lost all their money."</TE>
<TE>   "Forgive me, but I was in a Kmart store last week and everything
was on sale. Do we own any Kmart stock?"</TE>
<TE>   Janet Elstrom said, "If it declared bankruptcy, we own it."</TE>
<TE>   Lucy Holzer asked Jean Peters, "Can I have another cup of coffee?"</TE>
<TE>   Jane replied, "Only when the market hits bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Lucy sniffed, "I never did like your coffee anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Jane shot back, "And I never liked your Danish."</TE>

<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've written more than a few obituaries in my time. It is the first
thing they teach you in journalism school, and most every reporter is
asked to write them now and again. Most newspapers keep ongoing obit
files on certain outstanding citizens, but if such a thing is not
available, there will be press clippings, a list of family, friends
and colleagues who might have a few good words to say.</LD>
<LD>   You call them and hope they've learned of the death already. But
if they haven't, you murmur condolences and let them express their
grief through laudatory words, which you write down. You read all the
old stories, or books if the person is famous enough, and crib like
mad. You write fast because there is usually a deadline, but you try
to do it with grace. You hope it does honor to the person who has
died, something that the family will be able to cut out and send to
friends or put in a book. It isn't the most difficult journalistic
task around. It's just something that you do now and again.</LD>
<TE>   I wrote my father's obituary last week, and it was not like that
at all. There was no clip file, no phone list, no deadline, no
emotional distance. There was me sitting at my parents' kitchen table
in front of my father's manual typewriter trying again and again to
write something suitable for the Las Cruces Sun-News in New Mexico,
something we would have to pay to have printed in the obituary
column. The typewriter keys kept sticking, and there was no delete
key, and I kept misspelling everything--including my mother's
name--and writing sentences that sounded like they had been composed
by a funeral director. That I was doing this seemed impossible, as
impossible as the memory of that broad chest upon which I had leaned
my head so many times suddenly gone completely still.</TE>
<TE>   To a journalist, the information was skimpy. James Daniel McNamara
Jr. was 69. He was born in Chicago. He served in the Army, but in
between the wars in Korea and Vietnam (he always referred to himself
as a "Cold Warrior"). For 30 years, he was a social studies teacher
and a debating coach. He was named Outstanding Teacher in Baltimore
County one year, the date of which none of us can remember. He never
published. He married my mother  40 years ago and had two children.</TE>
<TE>   It was not a long obituary. My father was not a senator or a CEO,
not an author or a movie star. He didn't help found anything except
our family, didn't invent anything except, to a certain extent, my
brother and me. He was not rich, so his continual and generous
donations to various charities did not rate him a philanthropist.
Neither was he particularly ambitious, so his incredible breadth of
knowledge--he was often the first person I called when I started a
story about just anything--gained him no scholarly glory, no seat on
a talk show.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the only thing I wrote that meant anything at all was:
"He was a loving husband and father and will be greatly missed by his
survivors." Between those words, which would never make it into a big
obituary, was the story of a quiet, gentle man who loved his family
with the peaceful, unwavering devotion that certain Irish, and Irish
American, men have.</TE>
<TE>   He rarely raised his voice, and never his hand, in anger to
anyone. He always said, "I love you" at the end of a phone
conversation with one of his children. He was never without a book;
when I was young, the sound of goodnight was the thump of a book
closing, the clatter of his glasses on the nightstand and the click
of the light going off. My favorite Christmas present every year was
the inevitable box of paperbacks from Dad.</TE>
<TE>   After he retired, he and my Mom took a trip to Ireland and fell in
love; year after year they went back, and often my brother and I went
with them. Some years we begged to go somewhere else--Italy, Spain,
anywhere--but Dad loved the Irish so, and we could not refuse him. We
were to go this June to celebrate his 70th birthday. That loss is
somehow the hardest thing for me to think about.</TE>
<TE>   He taught his children to respect everyone, no matter their race
or religion or cultural background, to help the poor and pray extra
hard for the Republicans in the hopes that they would change their
ways. He was a devout Catholic who, though pained by many of the
church's conservative attitudes, never considered abandoning his
faith. The Catholic Church was his family; he believed it would only
change if its members changed it.</TE>
<TE>   No one loved music more than my father. He had a beautiful tenor
voice but he could not dance, could never learn, not even to please
my mother. He loved jazz and swing, and I think he had more Benny
Goodman CDs than any person not related to the man by blood. Although
he believed Artie Shaw had the greater natural talent, my father
never forgave him for his decision to stop performing. Goodman was
the better musician, my father said, because he remained committed to
his craft. My father sang continually to his children and then his
grandchildren. When he was in Ireland, he would sing to the cows.</TE>
<TE>   My father was the best teacher I have ever met. Whenever we toured
the battlefields of Gettysburg, which was near our home, people would
overhear my father explaining the events to us and, inevitably, a
crowd would gather and follow our family around while my mother
worried about whether we had enough egg salad to feed everyone. I
learned about the Chinese Cultural Revolution over dinner, the impact
of the ancient Greeks on modern society while raking leaves, and the
significance of the closing of the American West on visits to my
grandparents' house.</TE>
<TE>   When my brother and I were in college we often turned these
conversations into conflicts, challenging his analyses, his
white-male prejudice, his grasp of the facts. My Dad was unfazed. If
we couldn't back up our arguments, he dismissed us; if we could, he
listened and nodded, respectful of the opinion even if he disagreed.
He embraced our new teachers--when I read Mary Daly, he read Mary
Daly. All the way through.</TE>
<TE>   When my father knew he was dying, his only concern was for my
mother. "Be of good cheer," he told me after informing me that he was
not going to seek treatment for his very advanced liver cancer. "We
are all Christians here. I am not afraid, and I want no hanging of
crepe."  He didn't want a viewing or a funeral. "Just bury me in the
backyard and have a lot of Masses said," he would say. About 10 years
ago, he changed his mind a bit; he wanted his ashes to be scattered
off Downpatrick Head in Ireland. With my mother's, when the time
comes.</TE>
<TE>   I know my Dad is in heaven, because if he isn't, then there is no
heaven. I can imagine whom he asked to visit with first: his mother,
then Dorothy Day and W.B. Yeats, Jack and Bobby Kennedy, Tip O'Neill,
Benny Goodman, Frank O'Connor, St. Theresa and St. Francis, Michael
Collins, Peggy Lee, Ella Fitzgerald and St. Patrick.</TE>
<TE>   James Daniel McNamara Jr. was 69. He strove to be good in a world
where maybe that doesn't count as much as it should. He was not
famous or powerful, his achievements were not of public record or of
public note. He was not perfect, but he was an exemplary man. He left
behind no unfinished business. His family and friends knew they were
loved, and he knew he was loved in return. His wife was provided for.
His children were happy. He had no quarrel with his God.</TE>
<TE>   I have always thought my father extraordinary, but he never
thought himself so, and I know that he is not unique. When you lose a
parent, I have discovered, you join a secret society of those who
have too. And most of those deaths never make the front page. So this
is an obituary for all those who die without pomp and press
clippings. For the beloved parents and spouses and children who were
not famous or infamous, who didn't die in national tragedies, who
didn't win prizes or become household names. Like my father, they
were splendid in the quiet grace of day to day. It is not the stuff
of great obituaries, but it is the stuff of great lives.</TE>

<TE>   A little more than a decade later, Susan Iglehart's flowers have
grown into Susan Iglehart's Flowers, a kitchen-counter business
thriving on word-of-mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Every winter, Iglehart begins cultivating more than 80
hard-to-find varieties of annuals in the made-from-a-kit greenhouses
tucked behind her house in Glyndon, Md.'s, steeplechase country.</TE>
<TE>   And for a week in May, the long driveway to her stucco home is
busy with faithful customers arriving for orders placed in February.</TE>
<TE>   "It started because I had extras," she said. "And I can't stand
leftovers."</TE>
<TE>   When Philip and Susan Iglehart moved from a heavily wooded
Lutherville, Md., home to Connecticut years ago, Susan discovered the
wonders of sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a whole new world," she said. "I had never been
interested in growing anything before. My eyes glazed over when the
conversation turned to gardening.</TE>
<TE>   "But I started wanting to grow things, and then I had this vision
of a garden with certain colors--white cosmos and pink cleome. And
you couldn't find those colors in garden centers."</TE>
<TE>   When the Igleharts returned to the Baltimore area in 1988, Barbara
Trimble, a friend of more than three decades, introduced Iglehart to
the wonders of mass-producing seedlings indoors. "I don't know if I
taught her, or I was a liberating influence," said Trimble of Owings
Mills, Md. "She has always been amazing about projects. She suddenly
knew how to do it and began to do it on a grand scale."</TE>
<TE>   Iglehart, a photographer, said the experience was the same as when
she first saw a picture come out of the developer. "Once I saw what
happened when I put the seeds in the soil, I was hooked. I just kept
growing things, whether I wanted them or not."</TE>
<TE>   She didn't need all 250 plants that might come from a single
packet of seeds, but she couldn't bring herself to toss them out. So
she made a list of the extras and handed copies to friends, who
arrived in May to collect a free sample of Iglehart's new annuals.</TE>
<TE>   When things started to get out of hand ("I had plants under and on
top of everything"), she put a modest price on her plants--one that
was increased for the first time this year to $5.99 for a
six-pack--and began building greenhouses. News of Susan Iglehart's
Flowers traveled from her neighborhood to as far away as Annapolis,
Md., and the Eastern Shore.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't honestly say whether this hobby pays for itself," she
said. "I've never really put those two pieces of paper side by side,
if you know what I mean."</TE>
<TE>   She makes light of the work involved. She has help from a friend
during the most labor-intensive times--filling hundreds of trays with
more than 18 bales of the potting mixture and putting together the
orders before the May pickup dates. She transfers the thousands of
seedlings to pots by herself.</TE>
<TE>   The ageratum "Blue Horizon" will be her biggest seller again this
year. By the end of the pickup week in May, Iglehart's greenhouses
will be nearly emptied.</TE>
<TE>   Nearer the house are beds planted with great quantities of lilac
and hydrangea. She spends the summer supplying floral designers with
all this abundance, and she has customers who purchase an armload of
her flowers for their homes every week or so.</TE>
<TE>   "I found that people who take the trouble to grow flowers in their
gardens really don't want to go out and mow them down to put in a
vase," she said.</TE>
<TE>   So Iglehart is happy to share hers.</TE>

<LD>Although some may not consider lizards and slimy fish to be the
materials of fine art, French artist Bernard Palissy found their
forms intriguing. He combined his interest in natural history with
his artistic abilities to create his line of ceramic "rustic ware,"
all featuring the kinds of creatures you see here.</LD>
<LD>   To make this platter, the artist collected creatures (bugs, frogs
and fish, for example) and made molds. What's a mold? Think of an ice
cube tray, which is a type of mold. You pour water into the tray and
place it in the freezer. After the water hardens, or freezes, it
forms an ice cube, which can be removed from the mold, or tray.
Artists use molds and liquid clay in a similar way. They pour the
clay into a mold, let it harden and then remove the shaped piece.</LD>
<LD>   Here the artist put wet plaster over a creature to make a mold.
When the mold hardened, he removed the creature. Into the empty mold,
the artist poured clay. These molds were then used again and again on
his wares.</LD>
<TE>   To create a super-realistic look, the artist used special
transparent lead glazes. A glaze is a type of material that is
applied to ceramics before they are fired or "cooked." The glazes
Palissy used were extra shiny to make the creatures look slimy.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, this "rustic ware" was so popular that even the queen
of France purchased it. Works like the one shown here that were made
by the artist and others after his death are called Palissy ware.</TE>
<TE>   You can see it and lots of other art at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art. For more information, call (323) 857-6000 or visit

<HD>A Marathon Challenge, in Loving Memory</HD>
<DH>After Bertha Quezada died last year, seven of the clan
vowed to enter Sunday's event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARNELL JAMESON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Joe Quezada stood in his sister's room at Good Samaritan Hospital
in Los Angeles last March 4, everywhere he looked he saw pain. His
sister, Bertha Quezada, was dying at age 52 after a long fight with
Lou Gehrig's disease, or ALS.</LD>
<LD>   The relatives around him were grief-stricken, as he was. And, as
he looked out the window onto Wilshire Boulevard, the runners of the
16th Annual L.A. Marathon were trudging through the 26th and final
mile of their own ordeal, telegraphing yet another brand of agony.</LD>
<LD>   Quezada spent all that day either in his sister's room or staring
out the window at the runners. Eventually, the two images fused.</LD>
<TE>   "I looked at the pain in my sister's face, then at the pain in the
faces of the runners and thought, "We could run the marathon next
year for Bertha." Quezada, 36, of Whittier, recruited the others, one
by one, and by the time Bertha died at 11 p.m., all seven family
members around her had committed to run or walk the 2002 marathon in
her honor.</TE>
<TE>   On board were  Bertha's siblings: Quezada, Ramona Hernandez, 50,
of South Gate, and Claudio Quezada, 30, of Whittier; Joe's wife,
Monica Quezada, 33; her sister, Olivia Lopez, 32, of Culver City;
Hernandez's husband, Juan Hernandez, 50; and their son, Adrian
Hernandez, 23.  None had ever run a marathon or anything remotely
similar.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, they are trained, fit and, though appropriately
nervous, ready for the 26.2-mile challenge this Sunday. Last week,
all but Adrian gathered in the Hernandez's living room to talk about
their journey, and how it has made them closer, healthier (in two
cases, noticeably leaner) and helped them grieve.</TE>
<TE>   Bertha Quezada never married and had no children, but she was like
a mom to Joe and Claudio, who were 17 and 23 years younger,
respectively, than she.</TE>
<TE>   "Our parents were much older, and didn't always have their ear to
the ground," said Joe. Bertha, who worked as a secretary for Sears
for 30 years, was their real-world touchstone.</TE>
<TE>   "My sister instilled in me everything I now rely on as a man, in
my career and as a father," said Joe, a police officer for the Los
Angeles Police Department. "She taught me about ethics, morals and
even finances."</TE>
<TE>   Claudio, a driver for UPS, said, "She taught me how to be a good
person, how to behave and how to manage my life." For Ramona, a
homemaker, she was a "best friend."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday,  they're going to express their thanks.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the pain she went through doesn't compare to what we'll go
through, but somehow, putting myself through a little bit of pain
helps me keep her memory alive," said Claudio, who at 5 feet, 7
inches has watched his weight drop from 164 pounds to a runner's lean
138 since he started training.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for the challenge, they all joined L.A. Road Runners, a
marathon training and support group, which was Monica Quezada's idea.
"I knew if I was going to do this, I would need some help." She found
the group on the Internet. Every Saturday, the Road Runners meet for
a training-related pep talk and group run.</TE>
<TE>   "I liked the structure," said Monica. The Road Runners' 1,800
members break into pace groups according to each runner's speed, a
perfect setup for this family's varied abilities. Claudio, for
example, trains with the 81/2-minute-per-mile folks, while Ramona,
who plans to walk the marathon, works out with those doing 15-minute
miles.</TE>
<TE>   They also each train three to four more times a week. In doing so
they've realized that committing to such a task during an emotional
moment is one thing; long-term training for it is something else.</TE>
<TE>   "We all get lazy and don't feel like working out some days, but
when that happens I go back to Bertha," says Monica, who has lost 25
pounds since she started training. "I think of how hard she fought to
live. If she can do that, this is the least I can do, no matter how
much it hurts."</TE>
<TE>   When Joe feels his commitment waning, he, too, draws on his source
of motivation. "I know I've got the drive and physical ability to do
this, but some days that's not enough. That's where purpose comes in,
and I'm doing this for my sister." All say they were touched by
Bertha's will to hang on. When she was diagnosed in 1994, the doctor
gave her five years, and she lived for seven.</TE>
<TE>   They've each completed three 20-mile run-walks--the highest
pre-race mileage the Road Runners recommend--and are counting on
their conditioning, adrenaline and each other to pull them through on
race day. Though they will all start the marathon together wearing
matching red T-shirts, they'll finish miles apart.</TE>
<TE>   At one extreme is Ramona, who until three years ago smoked a pack
and a half of cigarettes a day and, before her sister died, had
"never walked a mile in my life." She plans to walk the course in
seven hours. Her attitude: "As long as I finish, I don't care how
long it takes."</TE>
<TE>   At the other extreme is Claudio, who says he will be "very
disappointed if I don't finish in under four hours." The others will
likely sprint, saunter or crawl over the finish line some time in
between.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, they believe Bertha is looking down from heaven getting
a big kick out of all this. "I know she'll be watching us and
smiling," said Ramona, "not only because she loves to see us
together, but because we're together in a common goal because of
her."</TE>
<TE>   Joe thinks his sister will be more laughs than smiles: "She'll
think it's pretty comical that all of us, at our different ages and
stages, are doing this at all."</TE>

<HD>Mother's Sorrow Not Punishment Enough</HD>

<LD>You could argue that Marlene Heath has suffered enough. She will
certainly be haunted for the rest of her days by the knowledge that
her actions led to the death of her two sons. Perhaps no sentence a
judge could impose would punish her any more.</LD>
<LD>   You could believe, as Heath's husband said, that the couple's two
dead toddlers "are jumping up and down in heaven" because Mommy
avoided a prison term in their deaths.</LD>
<LD>   Or you could wonder, as I do, when we will stop making addicted
parents, such as Heath, the victims and start giving more weight to
their children's lives.</LD>
<TE>   Heath's two children--Jake, 3, and Dylan, 13 months--died last
summer when she left them inside the family's minivan in her driveway
for more than three hours, while she slept off a bender inside.</TE>
<TE>   Heath, 40, of Simi Valley was charged with child endangerment
causing death, which could have landed her a 12-year prison term. She
pleaded no contest in November, and prosecutors hoped the least she'd
get would be a four-year prison sentence, the mandated minimum.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark
sentenced her last week to spend one year in County Jail, serve five
years on probation, perform 500 hours of community service and attend
52 parenting classes.</TE>
<TE>   Parenting classes? It seems like too little, too late to me. Her
children, after all, are gone.</TE>
<TE>   There are no perfect parents. All of us make mistakes, are
occasionally stupid or selfish or short-sighted.</TE>
<TE>   The Heath incident was one of a spate of cases here last summer
involving parents who left their kids locked alone in hot cars while
they ran errands. Several were arrested and jailed after worried
bystanders called police. Most were sentenced to probation and
parenting classes, and some lost custody of their kids.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a difference between leaving your kids in the car for
20 minutes while you run into the market for milk, and forgetting
about them for near four hours because you're simply too drunk to
care. Both are wrong, and should be punished.</TE>
<TE>   Probation and education seem to me like an appropriate combination
for the parent whose carelessness put a child a risk.</TE>
<TE>   But Heath displayed such disregard for her children's safety that
a year in jail is not enough. And I am not moved by the argument that
her bad judgment was a function of her illness--the disease of
alcoholism--so she should be set free to heal and grieve.</TE>
<TE>   Every addict trying to parent children ought to be pursuing
recovery. If you wait until your problem kills your children, you
foreclose the option of sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   Heath was a functioning alcoholic. But over the years there were
drunken binges and blackouts, and more than once her husband warned
her that her drinking might jeopardize the kids. Still, she didn't
seek help until her children were dead.</TE>
<TE>   The night before their deaths, Heath bought four bottles of wine,
she told police. She drank two that night, woke up the next morning
and drank another. Then she buckled the kids in their car seats and
went for a drive. An hour later, she pulled back into her driveway,
hit the side of her house with the van, left the kids in their seats
and stumbled inside.</TE>
<TE>   She collapsed and slept for more than three hours, while the
temperature hovered in the 90s outside. When she awoke, she ran out
to her van in a panic and found her young sons, still strapped in
their car seats, dead from the effects of the heat.</TE>
<TE>   When police arrested her later that night--six hours after she
said she'd had her last drink--her blood alcohol level was 0.17, more
than twice the legal limit for driving.</TE>
<TE>   I could see the emptiness in Heath's eyes last week, as she sat in
court holding onto her husband. I know she must regret what's
happened.</TE>
<TE>   But you can find regret among many whose actions injure
others--men who hit their wives in anger; drivers who take to the
road after drinking and cause deadly accidents. Justice isn't
supposed to turn on how they feel about what they've done, but on how
seriously society regards their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   We punish, in part, to send a message. That's why we toughened
laws against drunk driving, why we finally decided to treat domestic
violence with the seriousness it deserves.</TE>
<TE>   And that's why we ought not let Heath's heartache or her addiction
insulate her from responsibility for the tragic death of two little
boys who depended on their mommy to keep them safe.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Clark said he was persuaded not to send Heath to prison by
her husband's plea for mercy and the diligence with which she's
pursued recovery in the six months since her children died. Her
husband called her a loving wife and devoted mother who was crippled
by dependence on alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Since her arrest, she's been in residential treatment, where, her
lawyer says, she's doing "extraordinarily" well.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand about addiction," said lawyer Louis
Samonsky. "Alcoholism is a disease of denial. Alcoholics deny they're
alcoholics until something causes them to hit rock bottom. Sometimes
it takes hitting bottom for them to get the help they need."</TE>
<TE>   I understand plenty about addiction and the fog it puts in
addicts' eyes. I hope jail officials find a way to let Heath continue
her treatment behind bars. I hope she finds a measure of peace in the
process of sharing her story, as her community service should
require. And I hope her tragedy reminds others of the unintended
consequences of abuse of alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   But Heath's "rock bottom" cost her sons their lives, and that's
not something that her embrace of recovery should be allowed to sweep
aside. "It's true that she's definitely making an effort to get
better," admitted prosecutor Susan Aramesh. "But a lot of people feel
remorse after they commit a crime. They find God, they clean up their
lives. That shouldn't affect how we judge the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "If a baby-sitter had done this to someone's children, we'd be
outraged," Aramesh said. "If a stranger knew they had an alcohol
problem, continued to drink, continued to drive the kids and caused
the death of someone's children, the parents would be outraged and
demand that they be punished. Should we demand any less because the
crime was committed by the [children's] mother?"</TE>
<TE>   There's a price to be paid in a case like this, and the pain of
loss is not enough. We could show how much we value Marlene Heath's
children--and all children, defenseless against their parents'
failings--by making her punishment fit the crime.</TE>

<DH>At the homey Silver Spoon, Hollywood players one step to
the side of the A-list hold court, network, even cast their films.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES CASILLO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Sally Kirkland remembers the day when, on her way into the
Silver Spoon restaurant in West Hollywood, she encountered director
Quentin Tarantino loitering out front. Tarantino was looking for
actor Robert Forster, a regular diner at the Greek coffee shop,
hoping to cast him in his then-upcoming film "Jackie Brown."
Tarantino coaxed Kirkland into waiting with him for the actor to
arrive and they began to chat. What he really wanted to do, said
Tarantino--at the time one of the hottest directors in Hollywood--was
act. Kirkland gave him an impromptu method acting class for the next
hour and a half.</LD>
<LD>   The Silver Spoon is not a place of power industry lunches or a hip
hangout for young A-list actors; you won't find the kind of trendy
patrons who self-consciously type a screenplay into a laptop, talk
too loudly on a cell phone or discuss a spec script at top volume.
But it does have a quirky Hollywood vibe all its own.</LD>
<LD>   The decor is vintage simple. It has a patio, a long serving
counter and a back-room bar. The booths are roomy, tufted, Naugahyde
things of a salmon shade. There is wood paneling on the walls and
randomly hung framed movie posters. In fact, the most visually
striking thing at the Silver Spoon is likely to be the slightly
eccentric diners, such as the pair of faded Jayne Mansfields in
matching tiger vinyl coats having a late, light lunch.</LD>
<TE>   Certainly, the haunt has seen headier days. John Lennon would come
in back when the place was still called Theodore's and A&amp;M records
was nearby. And people still talk about the day a striking,
6-foot-tall woman sauntered in wrapped in African-type robes, wearing
a turban and carrying a baby in a papoose on her back. "Never mind
her, look who's behind her," someone had said, and there, meekly
following, was her companion, Robert De Niro, totally overshadowed.</TE>
<TE>   Today, there's a steady gang of regulars: character actors,
paparazzi, agents and retired TV writers, who help the diner maintain
an unpretentious show-biz atmosphere. Customers eat, drink coffee and
exchange Hollywood war stories--past and present. "You come in and
you know everyone by name," says Vera Bouzis, who runs the restaurant
with her husband, Andy, "like walking into your living room."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FRIDAY 8:15 a.m.: Kirkland, a regular for nearly 25 years, sits in
a back booth. She says she likes the Silver Spoon because it offers a
place where she can check in with friends--the free-spirited actress
stops by daily whether she arrives in a limousine or walks in
barefoot, dressed down and without makeup. "Now, Sally," a waitress
might scold, urging Kirkland to put on shoes, "that's against the
law."</TE>
<TE>   This morning Kirkland is wearing shoes and makeup and a
powder-blue blouse with a glittery, matching scarf. She is making
some notes for a speech she will give later in the day in honor of
Martin Landau (another Silver Spoon regular). "L.A. is entirely too
lonely to a single person," Kirkland says. "I don't cook; I'm
hopelessly dependent and these people take care of me." Kirkland has
already picked up a script for an HBO movie that has been left for
her at the cash resister.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a club," says actor-playwright-teacher John Miranda
when pressed for an explanation of the Silver Spoon's appeal.
Sometimes in the afternoons the young acting students still come in
and make each other laugh, just as John Ritter and Robin Williams did
when they hung out here after their Saturday morning comedy class in
the late 1970s. Comedian Rip Taylor typically sits at a side table by
himself in the corner or in a booth with a friend.</TE>
<TE>   SATURDAY 12:30 p.m.: At his regular back corner table on the
balcony, lunching with family and friends, is Forster. He is among a
number of actors who began frequenting the Silver Spoon after the
famed Schwab's Drug Store closed in 1985 and his back table has
become a sort of office to him. Forster says he likes it here because
he doesn't have to dress up to walk in. He likes the No. 1: French
toast served with bacon and eggs. He likes the corner table because
"it's the best view in the joint," looking out over Santa Monica
Boulevard. When the "B" rating in the window is pointed out, Forster
says, "You gotta keep your immunities up somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   At a nearby table, a minor fracas between a waiter and a
white-haired gentleman ensues over whether the meat loaf on the menu
is Salisbury steak. The waitress, Gloria, settles the dispute by
saying that meatloaf can be disguised as Salisbury steak with sauce,
onions and mushrooms, and promptly kisses the man several times on
the neck. "Why do you think I come here," the customer asks his
companions, settling for the camouflaged meatloaf. "It's not for the
food."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the customers have a sense of humor about themselves and
the restaurant. Examining the rim of a coffee cup, comedian Bernie
Guzman exclaims, "That's not lipstick, it's history!"</TE>
<TE>   Owner Andy Bouzis takes it in stride, but he takes his food
seriously. He became the chef here when Theodore's became the Silver
Spoon in 1988; he bought the place in 1999. He defies anyone to find
better short ribs. "And I say that because it's a pound of meat and
it's cooked very well with an excellent sauce," Bouzis says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SUNDAY 12:15 p.m.: Reading the Sunday paper and sitting under a
"Jackie Brown" poster is retired dancer and songwriter Bradford
Craig. The trim, sliver-haired Craig, who has been coming to the
diner for 32 years, played the chorus boy Hank whom Barbra Streisand
thanks her lucky stars to be seeing again in the splashy "Hello
Dolly" number in the movie of the same name. Later Craig became a
songwriter for Quincy Jones. "In the old days I came down here and
wrote all my songs," says Craig, who is now retired. "Sometimes I'd
sit here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and never move."</TE>
<TE>   It's a busy afternoon and every table is taken. At the next booth
an angry-looking elderly character actor has been sitting over a cup
of coffee for quite some time and is finally ready to order: a single
piece of toast. "Not the full order, sweetheart," he says, "and I'll
butter it myself." The waitress huffs off. "I don't know why they act
that way whenever I order," he says to the neighboring table.</TE>
<TE>   A turning point in the restaurant's popularity came when the
previous owners acknowledged its Hollywood clientele and covered the
walls with movie posters from the films of its patrons. There's a
poster for Kirkland from her film "Anna" (for which she received an
Oscar nomination), and one for De Niro from "Taxi Driver." Shelley
Winters is represented in one of her lesser-known efforts, "Tennessee
Champ." Martin Landau's poster for "Ed Wood" is signed "Thanks for
keeping me well fed all these years."</TE>
<TE>   "Even I got a poster over there," Craig points out. "'The Doberman
Gang,' I wrote the music and the songs for that. I guess I should ask
them to move it over here because this is my booth."</TE>
<TE>   From the next table: "I said one piece of toast!" the red-faced
character actor yells when his order arrives. "Not a single side
order!" The waitress huffs off again, leaving behind the extra slice
of bread.</TE>
<TE>   But where entertainment people gather there's bound to be some
drama. The conflict of the moment is the eighty-sixing of a regular
table of veteran show-biz types, including comedian Jackie Gayle and
celebrity photographer Roger Kornbad. "Apparently, they were laughing
too loud," Forster says.</TE>
<TE>   FRIDAY 9:30 a.m. (The Defectors): Several blocks east of the
Silver Spoon at the French Market restaurant, Gayle, once Frank
Sinatra's opening act, says, "I've been in a lot of great restaurants
but I've never been thrown out of a one of them except for that
dump." Andy Bouzis says there were other reasons that caused the
group to get the heave-ho, but would not elaborate. As Gayle and his
camp tell it, the dispute started with a conflict between tables. The
Gayle table likes to laugh and laugh loud and one morning another
patron complained. "This guy," Gayle says, "has never been in the
movies, never done a thing and he gets sarcastic toward me. I had a
career. This guy's never done nothing, believe me. He could put his
resume on a postage stamp. And he says, 'You guys are a little loud,
could you quiet it down?' I said, 'Look, you dummy, what have you
done? Nothing. And you're making these loud remarks everybody can
hear in the restaurant.' Follow me?" The customer complained, as
others had in the past, Bouzis says, so he felt he had to respond.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why the management didn't stick up for us," Kornbad
says. "They had some police officers there that morning and I asked,
'Have you ever written a ticket for laughing?' I mean, is it a crime
to have a good time?"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the usual crowd is breakfasting at the Silver Spoon.
There's the swapping of Hollywood gossip, stories of pending deals,
recent auditions and past glories--always with the hope that the next
business card exchange might lead to the next big break. "Maybe part
of the charm is that it's always here," Kirkland says. "It's
consistent and unchanging."</TE>
<TE>   Except the exiled laughers are no longer here. "Those guys are
good guys," Forster says. "I hope the owners will see the wisdom of
asking them back. After all, show-biz people gotta eat somewhere."</TE>

<HD>Meet Dr. Seuss</HD>
<DH>Part 2 The story so far: Young Ted Geisel loved books, the
sound of words and drawing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLORIA D. MIKLOWITZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Seuss, known as "Ted" to his friends, showed the kind of person
he would become even as a child. He was playful, becoming the best
ear wiggler of all his friends. When he was 11, he and his sister
Marnie were each given $10 to spend for the month their parents would
be away. Marnie spent hers in the first nine days. Ted had $8 left
when his parents returned. He said he wasn't a miser, just that "I
didn't then want and never would want most of the stuff money can
buy."</LD>
<LD>   World War I began in 1914 when Ted was 10. Ted's family had come
from Germany and spoke German at home. During this time, many
Americans turned against Germany. Ted said that local boys clobbered
him, called him the German brewer's kid, and yelled, "Kill the
kaiser" to him. In addition to anti-German feelings, it looked as if
liquor would be made illegal, and the Geisel's income would be
threatened.</LD>
<LD>   In 1917, Ted started high school. His father insisted he take
fencing lessons. Ted felt they added nothing to his life. He signed
up for an art class, but when he drew a picture upside down, his
teacher said he'd never succeed in art if he broke the rules.</LD>
<TE>   Schoolwork didn't interest him as much as drawing and writing
cartoons, acting in school plays and becoming an editor of the high
school yearbook.</TE>
<TE>   Ted entered Dartmouth College in 1921 and very quickly decided he
wanted to be editor of the humor magazine, the Jack-O-Lantern, also
called Jacko. He hung around the magazine office to work, staying up
all night sometimes. A friend said that Ted's humor was never mean,
that he was a sweet man, full of fun who laughed a lot. Ted intended
to study in college but found himself sketching weird animals in the
margins of his notebooks while the teacher lectured.</TE>
<TE>   In 1924 Ted was elected editor in chief of Jacko. He had met the
goal he had set for himself the first year of college. The next year,
he graduated from Dartmouth with a major in English and writing--and
average grades.</TE>
<TE>   Unsure how he could earn a living, he applied to Oxford University
in England, hoping to earn a doctorate and teach English.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: But would teaching English be the path his life would
take?</TE>
<TE>   Kids, March is the fifth anniversary of the National Education
Assn.'s Read Across America project, which celebrates the joys of
reading and honors Dr. Seuss, whose birthday is Saturday. For more

<HD>Hang On, State's Roads a Rough Ride</HD>
<DH>Potholes, pocks make California's the worst in the U.S.,
say those who might gain from repairs. But they're not alone.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Haage of Montclair has driven throughout the U.S. and believes
the absolute worst stretch of roadway is here in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   It's got to be the San Bernardino Freeway from East Los Angeles to
the Inland Empire, Haage said, adding this analysis: "Roughly poured,
cracked from overuse, poorly maintained and inadequately marked."</LD>
<LD>   "Interstate 10 always makes us glad to be home, where we can
finally exit its abuses," said Haage, a retired high school teacher.</LD>
<TE>   Sure, California has some pretty bad roads. Some stretches are so
rough, they make the sturdiest cars rattle like a tambourine. Others
have potholes so big they could support their own ecosystems.</TE>
<TE>   Now a recent analysis of federal roadway data, if accurate, would
affirm the feeling in the seat of our collective pants: California
roads are the worst in the nation. Even Arkansas looks down its nose
at us when it comes to road quality, according to this study.</TE>
<TE>   But before we consider changing our state motto from "Eureka" to
"Whoa, pothole," state officials and other transportation experts say
we should consider the source of the analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The study was sponsored by Transportation California, a coalition
of road builders, labor unions, and asphalt and gravel suppliers. The
group released the study as part of a campaign to support a March 5
ballot measure that would dedicate all sales taxes on gasoline to
highway and transit projects, an estimated $1.4 billion a year by
2008.</TE>
<TE>   That money now goes to the state's general fund, where it is used
for a variety of programs.</TE>
<TE>   Dedicating the money to transportation would clearly produce hefty
road-repair contracts for the construction industry. In fact,
supporters of the ballot measure, Proposition 42, have already begun
to air radio ads that cite California's last-place ranking when it
comes to road repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, the politics of potholes.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Trujillo, a spokesman for the state Department of
Transportation, doesn't buy the industry group's harsh critique of
California. "We have a highway system that is second to none," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Transportation California stands by its analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't make up the data," said Larry Fisher, who heads the
group.</TE>
<TE>   So, who can we believe? It would be nice if the federal government
compiled an annual standardized ranking to see how California's roads
stack up against other states. It could be similar to the annual
rankings compiled for student test scores and crime rates.</TE>
<TE>   But federal officials refuse to compile any road quality
comparison that might embarrass local transportation agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "We absolutely never have and never will rank states," said Jim
Pinkelman, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves it up to special-interest groups and academics to
perform the task using various methods.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis sponsored by Transportation California said that 37%
of California's main arterial roads were in "poor" condition, the
highest percentage of any state.</TE>
<TE>   The data for the study came from the Federal Highway
Administration, which collects such information from every state
annually. The states assess the condition of primary roads, usually
using lasers or ultrasound machines strapped beneath roving vans.</TE>
<TE>   In a further study of regions within California, the analysis
determined that the metropolitan region of Los Angeles and Orange
counties had the highest percentage of truly bad roads.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis found that 56% of the region's principal arterial
roads are in poor condition, meaning the pavement is badly cracked,
broken and "provides unacceptable ride quality." Only 3% of the roads
were rated good, with 5% rated fair and 36% deemed mediocre.</TE>
<TE>   In short, California is the worst and Los Angeles and Orange
counties are the worst of the worst.</TE>
<TE>   There is a direct correlation between how rotten the roads are and
how much we spend on fixing mangled tires and misaligned wheels, the
study found.</TE>
<TE>   According to the analysis, the rutted roads in Los Angeles and
Orange counties cost motorists an additional $641 annually in
auto-repair costs, above the normal wear and tear.</TE>
<TE>   Other independent studies that have ranked states based on road
quality placed California a bit higher on the list. But not by much.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden State ranked 21st out of 32 urbanized states, according
to a 1998 road quality study by the Surface Transportation Policy
Project, a nationwide group that promotes safe and clean
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   In that study, Southern California fell somewhere in the middle in
the roadway ranking of large metropolitan regions--better than
Chicago and Denver but far behind Boston and New York.</TE>
<TE>   For 11 years, David Hartgen, a transportation studies professor at
the University of North Carolina, has compiled an annual ranking of
the states' roads. But he also ranks the states on how much they
spend on maintenance and administrative costs, among other factors.</TE>
<TE>   By all of Hartgen's standards, California ranked 45th out of 50
states. "California has a lot of money, but they still have some of
the worst roads," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Only New Jersey, Massachusetts, Hawaii, New York and Arkansas rank
lower, in Hartgen's estimation. (At least one researcher rated us
ahead of Arkansas.)</TE>
<TE>   Whatever California's ranking, motorists such as Delores Long of
Van Nuys want to know that someone is doing something to make their
drives smoother.</TE>
<TE>   She complained that Burbank Boulevard in North Hollywood is a
"stripper street."</TE>
<TE>   There are so many potholes and craters that motorists are left
"bumping and grinding" down the road, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Van Camp of Murrieta believes the absolute worst road
around is the Riverside Freeway in Corona.</TE>
<TE>   "The paving has numerous gaps and spalls, where it seems Caltrans
has applied patches that have subsequently flaked off," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Van Camp compares driving the freeway with trying to run through
an obstacle course.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very challenging because you try to avoid the
irregularities you can see, you feel blows to the tires and all the
time you are trying to watch other traffic, all of which it seems is
trying to change lanes at the same time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There is one benefit, Van Camp said: "I doubt anyone falls asleep
there."</TE>

<HD>League Is in the Way of Sales Tax Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICK COLE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's clear that the way California cities pay the bills for basic
services makes no sense. It is a dysfunctional mess.</LD>
<LD>   For 20 years, California cities have demanded reform. Last month,
the state Assembly took the first baby step by passing AB680, a pilot
effort to share sales taxes revenue growth among Sacramento-area
cities. But guess who led the opposition? The League of California
Cities.</LD>
<LD>   The league's opposition is a classic case of the special interest
politics that has hamstrung fiscal reform since the passage of
Proposition 13 in 1978.</LD>
<TE>   After Proposition 13 slashed property taxes, cities and counties
faced draconian cuts in services, including police, fire, libraries
and parks. But Gov. Jerry Brown and the Legislature stepped in to
bail out local government using the state's budget surplus.
California voters loved the solution: lower property taxes with
minimal impact on services. So they kept voting for tax cuts until
the surplus was exhausted and the bailout was reversed under Gov.
Pete Wilson. Then local governments had to scramble to maintain
services and stay solvent.</TE>
<TE>   Cities have been particularly ingenious at avoiding service cuts
without going bankrupt through a range of questionable schemes, from
back-door tax increases to postponing capital reinvestment until
streets fall apart. But the most damaging trend has been to
aggressively pursue sales tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Auto malls and superstores now line our freeways, decimating local
businesses and cannibalizing customers from older retail areas,
leaving behind empty stores and dying shopping centers. Developers
and out-of-state retailers have pocketed gargantuan subsidies as
cities have been forced into cutthroat competition for retail
development, while "cash box" zoning has paved over environmental
concerns and blocked needed housing.</TE>
<TE>   Why do cities chase sales taxes? Because for every dollar in
sales, a penny comes back to the local city. So if you drive to
Cerritos to buy a $30,000 Ford Explorer, Cerritos gets $300. That's
more than cities collect as their share of a whole year's property
tax for a median-priced home in all but the most affluent towns.</TE>
<TE>   So with the biggest auto mall in Southern California, it's no
wonder that Cerritos can afford a new 82,500-square-foot library clad
in titanium. But without any auto dealers, Azusa voters had to
approve higher property taxes and compete for scarce state matching
funds to replace the city's obsolete library.</TE>
<TE>   Short of betting in Las Vegas, it would be hard to devise a worse
way to fund city services. The current sales tax allocation system
has been denounced by the Little Hoover Commission, a bipartisan
watchdog agency, by the Public Policy Institute of California and by
the Speaker's Commission on Local Finance.</TE>
<TE>   But powerful developers and retailers like the advantage it gives
them to extract subsidies or bend environmental protections. With
lower costs of providing services than inner cities, wealthy cities
and sprawling suburban communities love getting a higher share of the
loot.</TE>
<TE>   And the League of California Cities is so myopic that it sees any
attack on titanium-clad libraries as a threat to "local control." But
instead of local control, the league's position really promotes
out-of-control sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   Against this powerful coalition invested in the status quo,
disadvantaged communities can muster neither campaign cash nor
lobbying clout.</TE>
<TE>   The only countervailing hope for reform is the greater good of the
state, which ordinarily carries little weight with the Legislature or
governor. But Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) has pushed
AB 680 through the thicket of committees by being flexible and savvy
enough to compromise on his tax-sharing formula.</TE>
<TE>   Now Steinberg's bill is in the state Senate. And although it
applies only to the Sacramento area, it could be a model for the
state. If the league succeeds in killing it, comprehensive reform may
be dead for years to come.</TE>

<HD>If Not Peace, Set the Stage for Possibility</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID MAKOVSKY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Critics may be right in dismissing the possibility that Yasser Arafat
and Ariel Sharon can conclude a final peace agreement with one
another. Each, however, has a unique opportunity and responsibility
to break taboos and set principles that will facilitate peacemaking
by his successor.</LD>
<LD>   There is ample evidence to believe that peace is not possible
under the current leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat's continuous and unrelenting support for
violence--symbolized by the revolving door of Palestinian
prisons--continues to fuel Israeli fears that his goal is not a
Palestinian state in the West Bank but rather undermining Israel's
very existence. There is no evidence that Arafat is more willing
today to accept the generous terms--including 97% of the West Bank
and a capital in East Jerusalem--that he spurned when presented with
President Clinton's offer in December 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Sharon isn't likely to deliver the ultimate deal either. Sharon
believes Clinton's offer gave the Palestinians too much land, which
would imperil Israeli security.</TE>
<TE>   However, the fact that neither Arafat nor Sharon can make the
grand deal should not free them from a historical responsibility to
set the stage for successors to end this conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat and Sharon are not merely leaders. Each has unique stature
with his constituents. Arafat is the living embodiment of Palestinian
nationalism. Sharon is the last of a generation of Israel's founders
as well as the architect of the movement to populate ancient Jewish
sites in the West Bank with Israeli settlements. Each owes history a
last act.</TE>
<TE>   If they cannot make peace, at least they can fashion key planks of
a peace strategy. In the land-for-peace formula that has defined the
solution to this conflict, Arafat must talk to his people about peace
in a way that he never has, and Sharon must talk to his people about
land in a way that he never has.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, Arafat tells the American media that he wants peace,
but then he rallies a crowd in Ramallah with a chant of "a million
martyrs marching to Jerusalem." These statements confirm Israeli
cynicism about Arafat's duplicity.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of addressing Americans, Arafat must tell his people
something he has avoided saying: Israel and Palestine have equal
moral legitimacy, and thus both deserve to be permanently safe. He
must say that there are two legitimate national liberation
movements--one Palestinian and one Jewish--that must both be
accommodated through sharing the historic lands of Israel/Palestine.</TE>
<TE>   He needs to say that peace with Israel is morally right, not just
a practical or temporary necessity given Israel's military strength.
He needs to recognize that Jews have a rich heritage that binds them
to the land, not a 20th century colonialist connection.</TE>
<TE>   He needs to recognize that just as there is an important mosque in
Jerusalem, there was also a temple that was the center of Jewish life
for hundreds of years. This is essential for any Arafat successor
needing to deal with Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon must talk just as explicitly about sharing the land and the
future of settlements. It won't be easy for the architect of the
settlement movement to say that many of the 144 settlements in the
West Bank that he helped build will need to be dismantled in any
peace deal. But with so many settlements, there is no meaningful
partition, and thus neither peace nor security. The settlements may
exist only on a fraction of the West Bank and Gaza land, but the
doubling of their population during the Oslo era fueled Palestinian
fears of Israeli expansionism.</TE>
<TE>   If Sharon publicly conceded the reality that many settlements
cannot be retained in a final peace deal, then he would relieve his
successor of a huge historical burden.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic political constraints make these initiatives difficult
for each leader to contemplate and even more costly to implement.
Even so, such moves do not constitute peace itself but are key to any
peace strategy that aims to restore the shattered trust between the
two peoples.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most important lessons learned since the start of the
Oslo process in 1993 is that without a public strategy, no backroom
deals between officials can long survive. Through these declarations,
Arafat and Sharon can begin the long road back toward peacemaking. If
these leaders cannot make peace, they owe it to all to at least make
peace possible.</TE>

<HD>Myths Aside, Death Row Isn't Filled With Innocents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSHUA MARQUIS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent conventional wisdom presumption that the nation's death
rows are packed with innocent men and women is dead wrong.</LD>
<LD>   This "innocents in danger of execution" assertion comes from a
warmed-over study issued in 1995 by defense lawyer and Columbia
University professor James S. Liebman. In his study--reissued with
new conclusions in 2000 and again this year as part of a campaign to
discredit the death penalty--Liebman claims that the high rate of
reversal in death penalty cases means a high likelihood of innocence.</LD>
<LD>   It turns out, however, that the states with the highest reversal
rates are also among the states that seek the death penalty the least
and spend the most defending accused murderers. Oregon, with only 25
inmates on death row, is a good example. The Oregon Supreme Court has
overturned a whopping 68% of death verdicts in the 18 years since
Oregonians reauthorized the death penalty. Yet not a single reversal
was for anything to do with innocence, police misconduct,
prosecutorial misconduct or coerced confessions. Most were for
"faulty jury instructions" or other hyper-procedural errors. One
death sentence has been overturned twice solely because the victim's
family was allowed to describe the murder victims during the penalty
phase of the trial.</LD>
<TE>   The conventional wisdom also claims that Americans have had a
major change of heart on the death penalty. Although a 2000 Gallup
Poll claimed support for the death penalty had slipped from 77% to
63%, another poll, commissioned by Parade magazine in summer 2001
using more than 2,000 respondents, showed (before Sept. 11) that 82%
of Americans supported capital punishment in some cases. It's all in
how the question is asked.</TE>
<TE>   The conventional wisdom has the bloodthirsty prosecutor recklessly
hurling innocent men onto death row, stopped only by the threadbare
but plucky defense lawyer. Maybe in the alternate universe populated
by David E. Kelley's characters in "The Practice," but not in real
life. In the last quarter of a century, almost half a million murders
have been committed in the United States. Slightly more than 7,000 of
the murderers received death sentences and fewer than 800 have been
executed. The death penalty is properly reserved for the worst of the
worst.</TE>
<TE>   When Liebman's study was recycled in June 2000, it was met with
healthy skepticism by many scholars who pointed to fuzzy math and
counterintuitive conclusions. Liebman's study shows the state with
the "best" or lowest reversal rate to be Virginia, a state reviled by
those who want the death penalty abolished because of the large
number of people on its death row.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the study was again trotted out, with no new data or
research, just inflammatory assertions intended to further undermine
confidence that the death penalty is being administered fairly.
Meanwhile, the so-called Innocence Protection Act proposed by Sen.
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) has failed to gain traction because, despite
its catchy name, it contains provisions that would effectively
prevent states from ever seeking the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has introduced a much better
piece of legislation, the Criminal Justice Integrity and Innocence
Protection Act of 2001, which has received relatively little notice.
Although Leahy's bill would allow virtually anyone convicted of a
crime to demand a DNA test, Feinstein's bill would restrict DNA
testing to those for whom tests could establish innocence.</TE>
<TE>   We have far more to fear from guilty people wrongly freed by the
courts than from that tiny number wrongfully imprisoned and the even
smaller number of them who actually are innocent.</TE>

<LD>God again!</LD>
<LD>   The good news is that according to Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, God
is on our side in the war on terrorism. This is a definite
improvement over the Jerry Falwell-Pat Robertson position, stated and
then partially retracted, that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the
U.S. were proof of God's wrath over our national indulgence of
lesbians and the like.</LD>
<LD>   The bad news is that Ashcroft is again off on a holy war of his
own. Sermonizing to a flock of the Christian faithful gathered for a
meeting of the National Religious Broadcasters, the guardian of our
civil rights argued that "civilized people--Muslims, Christians and
Jews--all understand that the source of freedom and human dignity is
the creator."</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps Ashcroft should heed the words uttered by President Bush
in China: "In a free society, diversity is not disorder. Debate is
not strife. And dissent is not revolution."</TE>
<TE>   Presumably the president's heartfelt plea for religious tolerance
in China is also a defense of the rights of those Americans who are
not Christians, Jews or Muslims, extending even to those who want no
truck with organized religion at all.</TE>
<TE>   Can the attorney general be trusted to protect the rights of those
whose spiritual life rests outside of the Judeo-Christian tradition
when he has excluded them from the ranks of civilized people? Not to
split angels on the head of a pin here--or to restrict Ashcroft's
hearty expressions of his Pentecostal faith as manifested in his
daily prayer meetings at Justice--but it is alarming when he defines
his job in religious terms: "The guarding of freedom that God grants
is the noble charge of the Department of Justice."</TE>
<TE>   What hooey! The Justice Department is a creation of men to enforce
laws written by ordinary mortals--some of them drunk as well as
godless--and, most important, to follow the precepts of the U.S.
Constitution, itself the product largely of those founders who were
suspicious of efforts to bring any official notion of God into the
day-to-day governance of a free people. They had enough of that with
the religious pretenses of English kings, and they made no bones
about their deep concerns regarding the mixing of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, Ashcroft's recent remarks are an ecumenical
improvement over those he was said to have made last year to
Christian conservative columnist Cal Thomas, suggesting that only
Muslims, and never Christians, support terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Islam is a religion in which God requires you to send your son to
die for him," he reportedly told Thomas. "Christianity is a faith in
which God sends his son to die for you."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department later issued a statement that Ashcroft had
only meant to refer to those Muslims who are terrorists. Still, one
wonders if Ashcroft has ever heard that song, "Onward, Christian
Soldiers," or read about the Crusades, or been told of the violent
terror propagated by Catholics and Protestants for decades in
Northern Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush offered a more benign and inconclusive view of
religion in his China address, even mentioning Buddhism, Taoism and
localized religions. "Regardless of where or how these believers
worship, they're no threat to public order," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That is a noble expectation, to be sure, but is not one borne out
by history; throughout history and to the present day, religious
divisions have been great disrupters of public order. One wonders
whether Bush would have offered the same remarks before an audience
in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan or the former Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   What is most disturbing about the remarks of both the president
and his attorney general is the simplistic association of faith in a
major religion with virtue and responsibility. Simplistic, because
men of loudly proclaimed faith sometimes are responsible for actions
most uncivilized.</TE>
<TE>   We have come to an odd juncture in this world's modern history
when notions of God are once again routinely employed to justify and
counter the most heinous of human actions. Isn't it enough to state
that the wanton destruction of innocent civilians, whether by
primitive or sophisticated military means, is just plain wrong, as
defined by what exists of international law and the laws of all
nations worth respecting?</TE>
<TE>   For political leaders to bring God into it is to again risk
overplaying a hand that has a long and bloody history at the expense
of many true believers , as well as the rest of us.</TE>

<HD>Fee Increases Target Campers to Collegians</HD>
<DH>Budget: To help balance the books, state officials consider
a wide range of options that would cost residents and businesses
millions of dollars.</DH>

<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- California's deepening budget crisis has raised the
prospect that state officials may tap not only polluters and power
producers to help balance the budget but college students and campers
as well.</LD>
<LD>   Motorists could be forced to fork over more for ignoring a stop
sign. Nature enthusiasts could be expected to dig deeper into their
pockets to visit a state park. Ditto for students who dream of
becoming doctors, lawyers or dentists.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis released a list last month of more than $140
million in fee and penalty increases aimed at polluters, power
producers and traffic violators, among others.</LD>
<TE>   But potential payees expanded from the politically unpopular to
include feel-good favorites after the state's legislative analyst,
Elizabeth Hill, warned lawmakers last week that California's
projected budget shortfall had grown by $5 billion to $17.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, she produced a list of more than 100
budget-enhancing options for lawmakers to consider, including
reinstating recently reduced park fees. Attendance is up 30%, park
advocates estimate, since Davis began slashing the fees nearly two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Hill's office said the state could save as much as $20 million by
raising the fees, which dropped to as little as $2 for day use after
running as high as $6.</TE>
<TE>   She also recommended that lawmakers enact a new student fee
policy. Fees at public college campuses have not risen for eight
years. The state could bring in $12 million, Hill said, by increasing
resident student fees at Hastings Law School in San Francisco and
hiking nonresident and professional school fees at the University of
California.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials said that instituting a student fee policy is worthy
of discussion, but held off on endorsing the increases outlined by
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "These are areas worth consideration, but we will really need to
look at the totality of the budget picture before deciding whether
these are worth supporting," said UC spokesman Brad Hayward.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers could free up $162 million more, Hill said, by imposing
fees on private landowners to pay for fire protection and on timber
operators to cover the entire cost of processing timber harvest
plans.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Nance of the California Forestry Assn. predicted that some
property owners will be hit with both fees if they are approved.</TE>
<TE>   Fees Can't Exceed Cost of Providing a Service</TE>
<TE>   Forest landowners, he said, already incur hefty costs for
producing timber harvest plans, which for a small piece of property
can run as high as $30,000. And there's no guarantee that their plans
will be approved.</TE>
<TE>   "To further increase the cost of submitting a timber harvest plan
could have unintended consequences, which could include owners'
deciding to convert their land for other uses," such as industrial or
residential, Nance said.</TE>
<TE>   Fees levied by the state are by law not allowed to exceed the cost
of providing a service and must be used to pay for the specified
service.</TE>
<TE>   The ultimate decision on increasing fees rests with Davis and the
Legislature, and will be made after the state collects personal
income taxes in April. Armed with the fresh financial data, Davis
will release a revised spending proposal in May--an event that kicks
off legislative budget negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Already, though, Davis and Hill have offered ideas that would cost
residents and businesses millions of dollars. The governor, for
example, has proposed tacking a 20% surcharge onto criminal fines,
which in California are largely levied against motorists who commit
traffic violations.</TE>
<TE>   A ticket for running a red light in Los Angeles would rise from
$271 to $291. Ignoring a stop sign would cost $111 instead of $104
after the surcharge was added to the base fines. (The financial
punishment for committing either offense includes a base fine and
penalty and night court assessment fees.)</TE>
<TE>   The Davis administration predicts that the surcharge would raise
close to $46 million, with the money earmarked for the general fund.</TE>
<TE>   In her annual critique of the governor's spending plan, Hill
described the surcharge idea and another proposal by Davis to
increase civil filing fees by 10% as a "risky assumption." She cited
the ability of local officials to set fine amounts and the downward
trend in civil court filings.</TE>
<TE>   $1 Co-Payment Sought on Prescription Drugs</TE>
<TE>   Hill also recommended that the Legislature reject a Davis proposal
to begin charging Medi-Cal recipients a $1 co-payment on prescription
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Republicans count the co-payment as a new fee and peg the
amount of fee increases contained in the Davis budget proposal at
nearly $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Davis and lawmakers have solved about $3 billion of what
Hill is now projecting to be a $17.5-billion budget problem, leaving
about $14.5 billion to go.</TE>
<TE>   Former Gov. Pete Wilson raised fees and taxes and cut spending
when faced with a $14-billion deficit in 1991 at the start of his
first term.</TE>
<TE>   With elections looming in November, however, tax increases are
considered particularly taboo this year and have made fees, cuts and
borrowing a more palatable approach for politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Smartt, president of the California State Parks Foundation,
a nonprofit group that raises $5 million annually for parks, is
optimistic that public perception will help keep park fee reductions
intact.</TE>
<TE>   "If they raise fees, it will save a little bit of money, but I
don't think that will happen because the fee reduction has been so
well received by the public," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lew Uhler, president of the National Tax Limitation Committee,
suggested that a combination of common sense and shame should keep
lawmakers from raising fees.</TE>
<TE>   "To even consider raising revenues during a recessionary period
runs counter to every economic theory I'm aware of," he said. "They
don't have the guts to cut the spending they have bloated beyond
belief."</TE>

<HD>Davis Seeks Cuts in Power Deals</HD>
<DH>Energy: FERC is asked to reduce cost of long-term contracts
by $21 billion. Suppliers, analysts call the request a long shot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Gov. Gray Davis is seeking help from the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission--the same regulators he blamed for
letting power sellers charge sky-high prices and not immediately
lending a hand to prevent rolling blackouts last year.</LD>
<LD>   This time, Davis wants FERC to reduce by $21 billion the cost of
contracts the state signed at the height of its power crisis to
supply electricity over the next two decades. Power sellers call it a
political ploy, and industry analysts say the state might be wasting
its time.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think the state has a long shot of getting what they're
seeking here," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western
Power Trading Forum, which represents many suppliers.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't really expect FERC to do much of anything," said Harvey
Rosenfield, president of the Foundation of Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights, a Santa Monica-based consumer advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   They could be right. It was months before FERC capped electricity
prices in California in June, long after blackouts rolled, electric
rates climbed and other states began casting lures for Golden State
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   And while FERC has agreed with the state Public Utilities
Commission that energy sellers charged unfair prices for electricity
bought at the last minute, no refund check has arrived to help ease
the state's gaping $10-billion-plus power debt.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, power prices have plunged, and Davis has been roundly
criticized by consumer groups, by his Republican challengers this
election year and even by his own state appointees for buying too
much power at too high a cost for too many years.</TE>
<TE>   The state is arguing that FERC's inaction and illegal market
manipulation by sellers made the state's energy market spin out of
control last spring, resulting in soaring energy prices. It wants
FERC to lower the prices of the contracts or force the sellers to
renegotiate in good faith.</TE>
<TE>   The state will need to show FERC that it had a gun to its head
when making those contracts, said Severin Borenstein, director of the
University of California Energy Institute. But even if the state
proves its argument, it may not matter.</TE>
<TE>   "It will require first, that FERC actually will take that action,
and I think FERC has signaled that they're not inclined to, and
second, that FERC has the authority, because these contracts have
clauses that the state has to pay these contracts even if FERC finds
them unreasonable," Borenstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Davis expressed optimism Monday. "We're really expecting to
get some relief," he said. "I believe [FERC] will be sympathetic to
our complaint."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Fred Keeley, a Boulder Creek Democrat who is the
Assembly's point man on energy issues, says the state is doing
exactly the right thing:</TE>
<TE>   "I think that [FERC] is going to want to be very responsive to
California. If they continue to believe that deregulation is a good
idea, that the marketplace is the answer to the nation's energy
needs, I think they're going to want to see California be a success
story."</TE>
<TE>   The deals in question, worth $45 billion, were negotiated in
secret last spring, and California ratepayers were told the details
of where their money was going only after court battles from news
organizations. Tamara Young, a FERC spokeswoman, said Monday that the
commission would review the filing and request public comment before
taking any action.</TE>

<HD>Witnesses in Dog Mauling Case Tell of Other Attacks</HD>
<DH>Courts: Neighbors say they barely avoided injury. Man
testifies that he wrestled one of the 100-pound Presa Canarios to the
ground.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two dogs that fatally mauled a San Francisco woman regularly
frightened others who came across them, attacking or charging people
and other animals, according to testimony Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Rhea Wertman-Tallent, who works near the apartment building where
Diane Whipple was killed, told jurors that the two dogs growled and
lunged at another dog on the street two days before the fatal attack.
They were on their hind legs, teeth showing, trying to break free
from their leashes, she testified.</LD>
<LD>   "I never saw animals so crazed before," Wertman-Tallent testified
in Los Angeles County Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors are trying to prove that defendants Marjorie Knoller
and Robert Noel, who were Whipple's neighbors, knew their Presa
Canario dogs were dangerous. Before the attack on Whipple on Jan. 26,
2001, the dogs, Bane and Hera, had been aggressive with others nearly
30 times, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys have argued that their clients were responsible
dog owners who kept their pets under control.</TE>
<TE>   'The Dogs Were Making Horrible Sounds'</TE>
<TE>   During cross-examination, they noted that no one was injured in
the incidents that witnesses described Monday except for one dog,
which suffered a minor injury.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller, 46, and her husband, Noel, 60, are charged with
involuntary manslaughter and keeping a mischievous dog in connection
with Whipple's death. Knoller also faces a charge of second-degree
murder.</TE>
<TE>   Several prosecution witnesses said the defendants had been urged
to put muzzles or choke collars on the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Wertman-Tallent testified that after Whipple's death, she wrote a
note to herself about her own encounter: "The dogs were making
horrible sounds, like they wanted to kill something, now."</TE>
<TE>   Skip Cooley, who lived next door to Knoller and Noel, told jurors
that he opened the elevator door on the sixth floor one morning in
December and saw Noel and both dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the dogs absolutely sprung on me," he testified, saying
that it was in "attack mode."</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said he slammed the door and waited while Noel maneuvered
the dogs, which weighed more than 100 pounds each, into the
defendants' apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley added that he and his wife had complained to the apartment
manager several months earlier that the dogs were noisy and a menace.</TE>
<TE>   Noel replied with a letter to Cooley, explaining that he was
training Hera to respond to suspicious sounds, Cooley said.</TE>
<TE>   Another sixth-floor neighbor, Henry Putek, testified that one of
the dogs bounded out of the defendants' apartment in January without
a leash and charged toward him.</TE>
<TE>   "He was clawing and moving very quickly toward me," Putek said. "I
was scared at that moment, so I froze in place."</TE>
<TE>   Defendant Talked of Getting a Third Dog</TE>
<TE>   Professional dog walker Abraham Taylor told jurors that Hera broke
free from her leash in January 2001 and tried to bite the Belgian
shepherd he was walking. Taylor grabbed Hera and forced her to the
ground, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor also recounted a conversation the next day, during which
Noel told him he was considering getting another dog.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor testified that Noel said, "It's tough enough having two.
Can you imagine owning three?"</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, Mario Montepeque, who trains dogs as a hobby,
testified that Noel told him he did not want to spay or neuter his
dogs because he planned to breed them.</TE>

<HD>Richard B. Edler, 58; Ad Industry Leader Helped Bereaved
Parents</HD>

<LD>Richard B. Edler, an author and advertising industry leader who
co-founded a local support group for bereaved parents, died Feb. 16
of a heart attack at his Palos Verdes home. He was 58.</LD>
<LD>   During a 35-year career in the advertising business, Edler was
president or managing director of three major Los Angeles
agencies--Doyle, Dane, Bernbach; McCann-Erickson; and Foote, Cone &amp;
Belding--before forming his own consulting firm. The Chicago native
was active nationally in industry councils, particularly the American
Assn. of Advertising Agencies.</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1990s, he spearheaded a change in industry practice
when he introduced the concept of sequential liability, a legal
principle that protects advertising agencies from claims when their
clients fail to pay their advertising bills.</LD>
<TE>   He also was the author of "If I Knew Then What I Know Now," a 1995
book offering advice and inspiration from top business executives and
other successful people, including Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and
former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth. The book, which grew
out of a commencement speech by Edler, has been reprinted in several
languages.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, personal tragedy turned his interests in another
direction. His son Mark was an 18-year-old freshman at UCLA when he
took a shortcut to his fraternity house by walking on top of a
retaining wall. He fell to his death. In their anguish, Edler and his
wife, Kitty, turned to an organization called Compassionate Friends,
a support group for bereaved parents that began in England in 1969
and spread to the United States a decade later.</TE>
<TE>   After attending the group's national conference, the Edlers
resolved to start a local chapter serving Los Angeles and the South
Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The chapter has flourished since its founding in 1993, with
twice-monthly meetings at the Neighborhood Church in Palos Verdes and
a newsletter read by 600 people, according to Brian Winkelspecht, a
co-leader of the group and member of the national board of directors
of Compassionate Friends.</TE>
<TE>   The nonreligious group provides a supportive atmosphere to bring
together the newly grieving with people who have had time to deal
with a child's death. There is no charge for membership in the group,
which has 600 chapters nationwide and is also open to siblings and
grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   Edler was a chapter leader until 1997 and was a former national
president. He led the Compassionate Friends Foundation, which raises
money to support the organization's programs.</TE>
<TE>   He was a popular speaker at Compassionate Friends conferences and
wrote "Into the Valley and Out Again," about his own dealings with
grief. The book has become a favorite among bereaved parents around
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Edler made a point of starting chapter meetings by giving every
person in attendance an opportunity to talk about how his or her
child died. His openness about his own grief process encouraged other
men, in particular, to discuss their feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of chapters don't have men, but we found men would come,"
Winkelspecht said. "That was a positive influence of Rich. Men are
usually very noncommunicative in their grief. Rich set an example as
the leader ... and really helped the group a lot."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Edler left a son, Rick, a granddaughter,
a brother and a sister. Donations in his memory may be sent to the
Edler Family Foundation, P.O. Box 1015, Palos Verdes Estates, CA
90274.</TE>

<LD>Robert Strausz-Hupe, 98, former U.S. ambassador to Sweden, Sri Lanka,
Belgium, Turkey and NATO, died Sunday at his home in Newtown Square,
Pa., of a stroke and cardiovascular disease. He was also an author
and director of the University of Pennsylvania's Foreign Policy
Research Institute,</LD>
<LD>   A hard-liner against communism during the Cold War, Strausz-Hupe
served as foreign policy advisor to Republican presidential
contenders Sen. Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Richard Nixon in 1968.</LD>
<LD>   Nixon planned to appoint Strausz-Hupe ambassador to Morocco, but
liberal Democrat Sen. J. William Fulbright, then chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, blocked the nomination, calling him "the
very epitome of hard-line, no-compromise" policy against communism.
Fulbright relented by 1970, and Strausz-Hupe was named ambassador to
Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, and to the Maldives.</LD>
<TE>   He went on to serve as ambassador to Belgium from 1972 to 1974,
Sweden for the next two years, envoy to NATO in Brussels in 1976-77
and then ambassador to Turkey from 1981 until he retired in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Strausz-Hupe, born and raised in Vienna, immigrated to New York in
1923 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1932. He wrote numerous
books about foreign policy, taught political science at Penn and
founded its Foreign Policy Research Institute.</TE>

<LD>The Santa Ynez Band of Mission Indians unveiled bare-bones
construction plans showing another parking structure and the huge
footprint for a new three-story, 190,000-square-foot casino to
replace the existing facility.</LD>
<LD>   But it's what hasn't been revealed that created a buzz last week:
the possibility of a hotel atop the proposed casino.</LD>
<LD>   There are no plans to add two more floors in a third phase to
house a hotel, Chumash tribal Chairman Vincent Armenta said. But
Armenta said it could be a future option.</LD>
<TE>   "The first feasibility study two years ago had the option of a
hotel," he said. "It's not as if it's something that was pulled out
of the air. It was mentioned a long time ago."</TE>

<LD>It is apparent that The Times never met a bond issue it didn't like
or a tax reduction it did, even in the midst of a serious economic
recession ("Yes on Proposition 40," editorial, Feb. 20; and "Yes on
Propositions 41, 43," editorial, Feb. 21).</LD>
<LD>   Bond issues are the most expensive way to finance government
works. As one of the highest tax-rate states in the nation, how come
state and local governments cannot budget funds to maintain and
update their capital resources instead of always appealing to the
voters to authorize bond issues--future taxes in disguise? It is
about time the voters said no to the repeated appeals for more money,
more money, more money.</LD>
<LD>   Do not be fooled by the overused words "clean water, clean air"
(already mandated and paid for by polluters). Exactly how we buy
"safe" parks and coastal "protection" is pretty vague. Then there has
been a period of 10 years to upgrade our voting machines, although
California voters never heard the word "chad" before the Florida
fiasco, other than as a boy's name.</LD>
<TE>   Stan Katten</TE>

<TE>   A read of "Transportation: No on 42" (editorial, Feb. 18) prompts
one to wonder if The Times is mindful of its own readership. Remember
us? We're the ones spending the equivalent of one week a year sitting
in traffic. We're the ones who watched overpasses crumble in
earthquakes and were reminded that most of our freeways have outlived
their designed life span. We care about those things.</TE>
<TE>   What we don't care about is a philosophical problem you may have
with "earmarking" funds, especially when those funds are
transportation taxes we already pay and that should indeed be used to
repair our old and deteriorated transportation system. Those of us in
the real world will be voting yes on Proposition 42.</TE>

<LD>"'Limitless' Copyright Case Faces High Court Review" (Feb. 20)
reported that the plaintiffs in the case of Eldred vs. Ashcroft hope
to roll back the current, lengthy copyright protections. Despite what
producers and distributors might claim, the end goal of the copyright
act was the enrichment of the public domain.</LD>
<LD>   Each generation should have access to our cultural heritage, and
creators should have the right to further enrich our culture by
producing derivative and interpretive works based upon the works of
those who preceded them. At the same time, owners of copyright should
have the right to profit from their intellectual property.</LD>
<LD>   I propose a return to the provisions of the Copyright Act of 1976,
but with the following modifications: 1) At the termination of the
copyright period, the right to make and profit from copies of the
original work would remain with the copyright holder, but the right
to make derivative works would pass into the public domain; and 2) if
the copyright holder failed to make the original work continuously
available to the public, the original work would pass into the public
domain.</LD>
<TE>   Why grant to anyone the right to deprive the public of much-loved
works indefinitely?</TE>

<TE>   Being an amateur musician always in search of written music for my
favorite songs, it has been one of my frustrations that so much
copyrighted music remains unpublished. When musicians transcribe
music and place it on the Internet for others to use, free of charge,
the copyright holders immediately threaten legal action.</TE>
<TE>   However, the music remains unpublished and thus unavailable to the
public. I would propose that copyrights be treated the same as
trademarks. Use them or lose them. If copyright holders sit on a
copyright without promoting it, it should revert to the public
domain. If the copyright holders actively promote the work, they
would retain ownership for their lifetime.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Will Not Lie to Public, Defense Chief Says," Feb. 21:</LD>
<LD>   The first lie was told by the new Office of Strategic Influence
when Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that there would be no
lying by the new agency. Reminiscent of the old Soviet Union, now we
have an official agency dedicated solely to disseminating propaganda
in order to distort reality.</LD>

<TE>   Now, for all the folks who are still asking the question, "Why do
they hate us?" you help us to understand. On your Feb. 22 front page
we have the following three articles:</TE>
<TE>   1. "'Reality' TV Eagerly Marches Off to War," a review of the
cooperation of the U.S. Defense Department with reality TV shows that
are selling the public on the U.S. war efforts. (At least one network
that airs reality shows is owned by a company that produces
war-making products.)</TE>
<TE>   2. "Rumsfeld Addresses 'Unfortunate' Attack," a halfhearted
apology from Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld for our killing of
"non-enemies" in a non-declared war--which is in clear violation of
international law.</TE>
<TE>   3. "Colombian Army Attacks Rebel Posts," on the breakout of
"all-out war" in Colombia, a war that is supported with money and
arms provided by the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   Any further questions?</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Long</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>

<TE>   Secretary Rumsfeld is certainly proving to the world what a tough,
alpha male he is. His TV presence is very good. He needs work on the
wisdom and statesmanship dimensions.</TE>

<LD>It amazes me that our government will go to great lengths to
prosecute suspected Nazi war criminals yet ignore others ("Death Camp
Suspect Loses His Citizenship," Feb. 22). There are many suspected
Japanese war criminals alive today, most of them former guards at
prison camps, who murdered and abused our men. They were never
brought to justice. I know one by name and his whereabouts in Tokyo.
A friend of mine, a former B-29 navigator who was shot down near
Tokyo, also knows the name of another, who is now a successful
businessman.</LD>
<LD>   Our men never received medical treatment while in captivity and
many died of medical neglect and starvation. And what about the
horrendous tortures meted out to our captured pilots and GIs during
the Vietnam War? Why aren't we making efforts to prosecute Vietnamese
war criminals?</LD>
<LD>   While I have no love for the likes of John Demjanjuk, if our
government is unwilling to go after Japanese and Vietnamese war
criminals, then it should leave Demjanjuk alone.</LD>

<LD>I agree completely with your Feb. 19 editorial opposing Amendments A
and B. I have never been in favor of term limits, and for good
reason. Term limits, in effect, disenfranchise the voters; those who
favor limits only think they are assuring a better representation by
those elected.</LD>
<LD>   I worked in L.A. city government for 36 years and can tell you
from experience that government works best when the elected
representatives know their way around. There is a lengthy learning
period for all new legislators, so that those who know the most are
the ones who really "run" the government--and those are the career
employees and the lobbyists, neither of whom are elected by the
people.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever happened to the concept of voting them out of office if
they're not doing their jobs to the voters' satisfaction? We should
eliminate all term limits anywhere as soon as possible.</LD>

<LD>One of the marks of 20th century U.S. art is that its practitioners
were not nearly as dogmatic as Europeans at maintaining distinctions
between "high art" like painting and ballet and "low art" like
circuses and TV. Many of the best artists in the U.S., including
comedian Charlie Chaplin, director Preston Sturges and composer Aaron
Copland, moved easily between "art" and entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   One of the great masters of writing on multiple levels was
animator Chuck Jones, who died at 89 last Thursday at his home in
Corona del Mar. Jones' more than 300 animated films entertained the
little ones but also engaged the adults in a sophisticated, vigorous
pop culture.</LD>
<LD>   Consider "What's Opera, Doc?," Jones' ambitious six-minute version
of Richard Wagner's 14-hour "The Ring of the Nibelung." This 1957
spoof was inducted into the National Film Registry in 1992 as one of
"the most culturally, historically and aesthetically significant
films of our time" because of the sly way it folded slapstick humor
into witty jabs at both Teutonic epics and Walt Disney's "Fantasia."</LD>
<TE>   Or watch as Bugs Bunny in the 1952 cartoon "Rabbit Seasoning"
persuades Elmer Fudd to fire his shotgun at Daffy Duck, not Bugs,
even though Daffy has just posted a forest of signs declaring it
"Wabbit Season":</TE>
<TE>   Daffy: Shoot him now! Shoot him now!</TE>
<TE>   Bugs: You keep out of this. He doesn't have to shoot you now.</TE>
<TE>   Daffy: Aha! Pronoun trouble! It isn't 'He doesn't have to shoot
you now.' It's 'He doesn't have to shoot me now!' And I say he does
have to shoot me now! So shoot me now!</TE>
<TE>   Bang!</TE>
<TE>   Elmer blasts Daffy then because, as animation scholar Charles
Solomon has pointed out, Bugs has learned how to exploit Daffy's
principal character flaw: He is "clever enough to have some sense of
the situation, but too vain to realize that he can't control it. He
lets himself get carried away by his own words and gets his beak shot
off again and again."</TE>
<TE>   Jones was able to create psychologically rich portraits because he
loved his characters too much to mock them simplistically. His witty
character dialogues inspired modern animators like "Simpsons" creator
Matt Groening. And his detailed renderings of subtle human features,
like the flicker of an eyebrow that reveals love, a dramatic
departure from the overwrought animation traditions of his day, have
been held up as a model by the creators of "Samurai Jack," one of
most artistically acclaimed cartoons on the air today.</TE>
<TE>   True to the distinctly American form, Jones' work had the depth of
art and the levity of entertainment. His demise is sad, but as Bugs
exclaims at the end of "What's Opera, Doc?," "What did you expect--a
happy ending?"</TE>

<LD>When legendary surfer John "Doc" Ball founded the Palos Verdes
Surfing Club in 1935, the club's creed, displayed between a set of
shark jaws in his Los Angeles dental office, included a pledge to
"strive to conduct myself as a club member and a gentleman, so help
me God."</LD>
<LD>   Times have changed.</LD>
<LD>   Today some Palos Verdes surfers belong to the Dirty Underwear Gang
or the Bad Boys and act like jerks, not gentlemen. Many live in
multimillion-dollar homes that didn't yet exist in Ball's day, and
their greedy credo is: If you don't live here, don't surf here. These
pampered punks vandalize cars and throw rocks and sometimes punches
at "outsiders" who dare set board to wave along the Palos Verdes
coast. Forget the romantic notion of a brotherhood of riders
searching for the perfect wave. Theirs is the newer Southern
California convention of exclusivity enforced through intimidation,
never mind that the piece of paradise they view as their own gated
community belongs to the public.</LD>
<TE>   Thirty years ago residents of this bluff-side community supported
Save Our Coastline, the campaign that led to state laws guaranteeing
public access to beaches. Some residents' enthusiasm faltered in the
translation from principle to practice.</TE>
<TE>   Great "breaks" across the world suffer from localism, but in the
last decade the Palos Verdes Peninsula has developed a reputation for
being among the most hostile surfing areas. The brawl between locals
and outsiders described by Times reporter Kenneth R. Weiss in
Sunday's Times is just the latest example.</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago a group of South Bay surfers filed a civil lawsuit
against local surfers and the city of Palos Verdes Estates, which,
the suit alleged, knew about but did little to stop assaults,
vandalism and harassment. The parties settled. The effect of the
lawsuit can be seen in stepped-up efforts by the Palos Verdes Estates
police to crack down on intimidation by running undercover stings and
mounting an Internet camera as a crime deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   Whether city officials take the problem seriously enough--some
argue they do not--will be tested by how they stand up to local
surfers' efforts to have the "surf cam" taken down and to limit
parking on public streets to residents with permits; these demands
amount to bullying attempts at turf protection.</TE>
<TE>   Doc Ball, who died in December at 94 (he had moved to Eureka and
traded surfboard for skateboard), once estimated that when he took up
the sport 70 years ago he shared the entire California coastline with
perhaps 50 other surfers. Today there can be almost  that many on a
single wave. Palos Verdes' spoiled young men are going to have to
learn to share.</TE>

<LD>The barbaric murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl did
more than devastate his family, friends and co-workers. It also
illumined the borderless web spun by international terrorists and the
difficulty of steering Pakistan away from Islamic fundamentalism.</LD>
<LD>   The main suspect in Pearl's kidnapping and killing in Pakistan is
Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a Briton born to Pakistani parents. He
traveled to Bosnia, Afghanistan and, in 1994, into India, where he
kidnapped a group of Westerners and demanded the release of a fellow
militant in an Indian prison. He was instead caught and jailed.
Unfortunately, five years later, India freed Sheikh, his mentor,
Maulana Masood Azhar, and a third prisoner in exchange for the
release of more than 150 people aboard an Indian Airlines plane
hijacked by Islamic militants to Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   As the Reagan administration showed when it sold arms to Iran in a
futile attempt to win the release of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon,
it is difficult for nations to resist the pleas of families to ransom
their loved ones. But the danger is clear from the Sheikh case:
Terrorists keep committing terror.</LD>
<TE>   Azhar is currently under house arrest in Pakistan. While
imprisoned in India, he told police of meetings with groups linked to
Al Qaeda that attacked U.S. forces in Somalia in 1993 and U.S.
embassies in Africa in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has rightly said that
the target of the kidnappers was his government as much as it was
Pearl. Islamic fundamentalism has been a problem in Pakistan for a
quarter-century. The religious political parties have not gotten much
support in elections, but a previous military ruler, Zia ul-Haq,
wooed them to give himself political legitimacy. The CIA strengthened
the fundamentalists when it used them against the Russians who
invaded next-door Afghanistan in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   A special concern is the involvement of Pakistan's shadowy
Inter-Services Intelligence agency with fundamentalists and possibly
with the kidnapping of Pearl. The agency was godfather to the
fanatical Taliban rulers of Afghanistan. Musharraf has installed new
agency leaders, but many  mid-level functionaries remain sympathetic
to the extremists.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's kidnappers demanded the release of Pakistanis captured in
Afghanistan and held at the U.S. naval base in Cuba and the return of
the former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan. But some intelligence
officials believe that the terrorists intended to kill Pearl from the
start. They also say other Muslim extremists  involved in the Pearl
murder may have slipped back to their bases in the Persian Gulf
region.</TE>
<TE>   Finding them will be difficult even if intelligence agencies in
the region cooperate. But beyond the need to bring Pearl's murderers
to justice, a vigorous manhunt would show support for Musharraf in
his efforts to cut the ties between government security agents and
terrorists. And whether successful in this specific hunt or not, the
effort would  turn up information and informers, increasing the heat
on the entire network.</TE>

<LD>William Schneider's open admiration for President Bush's cowboy
diplomacy is nauseating (Opinion, Feb. 24). Rather than trying to
convince us that the "axis of evil" reference appears to be working
and that the axis is running scared, he should look more critically
at the fallout of this remark. All the members of the "axis" did was
to return words with words. They succeeded in looking accommodating
while we looked like bullies spoiling for a fight. If the "axis"
reference was such a big part of Bush's diplomacy, I submit he would
not have backpedaled as he did in the face of angry demonstrations on
his visit to South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   No, the reality is simpler: Bush needed to create the backdrop of
a larger, different terror to justify his huge defense budget. It
doesn't take a learned political analyst to figure out that loyalty
to its corporate sponsors is this administration's first priority.</LD>

<TE>   I would be more impressed by Schneider's puffery if his hero were
not a transparent phony. Bin Laden and 15 of the Sept. 11 hijackers
were Saudis. The money that supported them came primarily from the
Saudis. It is a corrupt and repressive regime that emphatically does
not believe in democracy. All this, supposedly, defines our evil
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   If Dubya were an honest man, he would have included Saudi Arabia
in his foolish axis. Yet he has not shaken a finger at the Saudis,
much less rattled a saber.</TE>
<TE>   We all know why. This is a government of, by and for the
oil-igarchy. Its members believe that what is good for Enron is good
for the U.S., and they hope they can keep the war going long enough
to drain us all dry.</TE>

aggressive cowboy rhetoric was instrumental in the demise of
communism in the Soviet Union, or that Bush's current bombast might
bring positive results today vis-a-vis Iran, Iraq and North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The historical change that brought death to the doctrine of a
classless society in the former Soviet Union was the utter scorn of,
and rejection by, the proletariat itself.</TE>

<HD>Colombia's Just War on Its Own Terrorists</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States must support the belated decision by President
Andres Pastrana of Colombia to recognize guerrillas as terrorists and
help put a stop to 40 years of terrorism there ("Colombia's Patience
Ends," editorial, Feb. 22). Many Americans and Europeans have been
killed along with the Colombian soldiers, police officers and
civilians who have died at the hands of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army.</LD>
<LD>   Until Pastrana decided to take overdue action, the guerrillas were
protected by the Colombian government and granted a safe haven for
their operations while civic-minded and decent citizens endured
extortion, kidnappings and assassinations perpetrated by the
guerrillas. One of the key issues that has tied Pastrana's hands is
that the international community, especially Europe, sees the FARC as
a legitimate political force.</LD>
<LD>   World leaders and human rights organizations must recognize that
Colombia's guerrillas are not honorable people who want peace. They
use drug money to buy sophisticated weapons, hijack airplanes and
blow up buildings, oil pipelines, electric towers and water systems.
They thrive on lawlessness and will continue fostering war in order
to survive.</LD>

<LD>Michael Ramirez's Feb. 23 cartoon (Commentary) likening the actions
of a mentally ill postpartum Andrea Yates to the twin killing-bred
dogs, Bane and Hera, offends me to the very center of my soul.</LD>
<LD>   We in the mental health field are very aware of postpartum
psychosis; it is no frivolous pretense-defense. The anger should be
directed at the failings of a system that does not properly respect
and address the needs of the mentally ill. What Yates tragically
enacted was a reflection of her own inner Bedlam. She is no crazed,
jealous Medea, no "mad dog," but a pitifully ill and fragile woman
who was not supported by an equally fragile care system. Were I
canine, I would snarl at the esteemed cartoonist; as a
psychotherapist, I suggest he examine the twin concepts of ignorance
and misogyny.</LD>

<HD>Robert Lamphere, 83; Soviet Espionage Specialist for FBI</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert J. Lamphere, an FBI counterintelligence specialist who
supervised many of the most notorious postwar Soviet espionage cases,
including the atomic spy case that led to the execution of Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg, has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Lamphere, a resident of Green Valley, Ariz., and Hayden, Idaho,
died of prostate cancer Jan. 7 in a hospital in Tucson.</LD>
<LD>   The key to one of the United States' greatest Cold War
counterintelligence coups was the top-secret breaking of the Soviet
wartime code, which led to deciphering intercepted messages that had
been sent by the Soviet consulate in New York and its embassy in
Washington to Moscow between 1944 and 1945.</LD>
<TE>   Information gleaned from those deciphered messages and the FBI
investigations presided over by Lamphere led to unmasking not only
the Rosenberg spy ring but many other Soviet spies.</TE>
<TE>   But cracking the Soviet wartime code was a long, tedious process,
and little progress had been made when Lamphere was transferred from
the New York field office to the Soviet espionage section at FBI
headquarters in Washington in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   The several pages of partly decoded Soviet messages he found in
the section's safe were mostly blank, containing deciphered words and
code names that were virtually meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   But Lamphere was impressed that cryptanalysts in the Army Security
Agency had managed to make even a few partial breaks in the
supposedly impregnable Soviet code, and he proposed offering the
FBI's assistance in providing information that might help them
further crack the complicated numerical code system.</TE>
<TE>   "The KGB messages were to change my life," Lamphere wrote in his
1986 book, "The FBI-KGB War: A Special Agent's Story" (Random House).
"More important, they were to affect the course of history: In the
coming years, their revelations would lead directly to decisive
actions that the FBI took against KGB operations in the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   Born Feb. 14, 1918, in the Coeur d'Alene mining district of Idaho,
Lamphere grew up in Mullan, Idaho, where his father leased the rights
to mine underground ore deposits. After attending the University of
Idaho and its law school, Lamphere completed his degree at the
National Law School in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Attracted both by the FBI's elite "crime-busting" image and "the
idea of being among the very best," Lamphere joined the FBI after law
school in 1941.</TE>
<TE>   After seven months working in the FBI field office in Birmingham,
Ala., he was transferred to the FBI's New York City office, where in
31/2 years he made more than 400 arrests, mostly involving Selective
Service Act violations.</TE>
<TE>   Then he was transferred to FBI headquarters in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1947, he met for the first time with Meredith Knox
Gardner, the brilliant Army Security Agency cryptanalyst and linguist
who was working on deciphering the Soviet wartime code. Gardner's
painstaking work was aided by the charred remnants of a Soviet code
book found on a battlefield in Finland in 1944, as well as the
intercepted coded Soviet intelligence messages.</TE>
<TE>   Lamphere offered to provide Gardner with information that the FBI
might have or be able to obtain on a particular subject being
discussed in one of the deciphered message fragments. As a result of
information supplied by the FBI, Gardner began making slow but steady
progress in breaking the code.</TE>
<TE>   A major breakthrough came when Gardner asked Lamphere if he could
obtain the plain text of information that had been sent to the Soviet
Union in ciphered form in 1944.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out that a mass of material in Russian had been
photographed by FBI agents during an investigation into Soviet
operations in New York in 1944.</TE>
<TE>   "The material I had delivered [to Gardner] was of great assistance
to him as he worked to make his own, correct KGB codebook," Lamphere
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember well his slight smiles of pleasure when in his work on
the messages, he would stop for a moment, reach for his own version
of that KGB codebook, and hand-print a word in Russian next to one of
the [coded] number-groups."</TE>
<TE>   Each week from the moment of their breakthrough, Lamphere wrote,
he would receive additional deciphered messages and new fragments of
messages that had earlier been partly deciphered.</TE>
<TE>   "As the messages became readable, I could set in motion
investigations based on what they said." At times, Lamphere wrote, he
had agents in a dozen cities looking into a dozen different cases.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't until September 1949 that the real pay-off began.</TE>
<TE>   That month, President Truman announced that the Russians had
exploded an atomic device in August, thus ending the U.S. nuclear
monopoly and prompting members of the intelligence community to
wonder if the Russians' speed in developing their own bomb had been
aided by crucial research information stolen from the United States.</TE>
<TE>   While examining a newly deciphered 1944 Soviet message before
Truman's announcement, Lamphere discovered data and theories that
appeared to have come directly from inside the top-secret Manhattan
Project to build the atomic bomb in Los Alamos, N.M.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, the FBI determined that the author of the paper
summarized in the Soviet message was Klaus Fuchs, one of the top
British scientists on the Manhattan Project.</TE>
<TE>   During interrogation by British authorities, Fuchs admitted that
he had spied for the Russians. Later, when Lamphere showed him photos
of an FBI suspect, Fuchs identified Harry Gold, a Philadelphia
chemist, as having been his contact man. Gold then led the FBI to
David Greenglass, a U.S. Army machinist who had worked at Los Alamos,
and Greenglass named his brother-in-law, Julius Rosenberg, as leader
of the spy ring.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg and his wife, Ethel, were arrested and accused of
passing secret atomic-bomb information to the Soviet Union. The
couple pleaded innocent, but in 1951, a jury found them guilty of
conspiracy to commit espionage. The Rosenbergs were executed in 1953,
the first U.S. civilians ever put to death for wartime spying.</TE>
<TE>   At a 1996 conference on the secret code-breaking operation (dubbed
the Venona Project) at the National War College in Washington,
Lamphere said that he and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover opposed
executing Ethel Rosenberg. Although the evidence supported her guilt,
Lamphere said, she was not as deeply involved in spying as was her
husband, and she also was the mother of two small children. But, he
said, their recommendation was overruled by President Eisenhower.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the FBI in 1955, Lamphere worked at the Veterans
Administration, where he rose to the rank of deputy administrator
within five years. From 1961 to 1981, he was an executive with John
Hancock Mutual Insurance Co.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Martha.</TE>

<HD>Santa Paula Mayor's Wife Under Probe in Driver's License
Fraud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wife of Santa Paula's mayor is the subject of a probe by the
California Department of Motor Vehicles into whether she and others
conspired to sell driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, court
records show.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, investigators searched the home of Mayor Ray Luna and
his wife, Rosemarie Mejia-Luna, who has worked at the DMV office in
Santa Paula for 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities were seeking evidence of allegations that Mejia-Luna
was part of a network that distributed fraudulent driver's licenses
from September 1999 to December 2000, according to search warrant
affidavits filed last week in Ventura County Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   On at least six occasions, illegal Mexican immigrants paid from
$1,000 to $1,800 to apply for driver's licenses at other DMV offices
in Southern California and pass driving tests at the Santa Paula
field office, the documents state.</TE>
<TE>   Mejia-Luna's attorney, Robert Schwartz, said Monday that his
client "categorically denies any and all involvement with any illegal
activity."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Luna could not be reached for comment Monday. Last week, he
said he stood by his wife and thanked the community for supporting
the family under "this cloud of suspicion."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are expected to finish the probe in the next few
weeks and forward the information to the Ventura County district
attorney's office, which will decide whether to file criminal
charges, said DMV spokesman Bill Branch.</TE>
<TE>   To obtain a driver's license in California, applicants must show
proof of legal residence, pass written and driving tests and pay a
$12 fee. There is no cost for the driving test, Branch said.</TE>
<TE>   Search warrant affidavits served Feb. 14 on the Lunas' Santa Paula
home and on Mejia-Luna's workstation at the DMV office were filed
Friday afternoon in Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavits show that investigators interviewed six illegal
immigrants and a DMV manager in Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Two applicants for driver's licenses told DMV investigator Elva R.
Godoy in December 2000 that they had purchased their licenses from
Leticia Martinez and Carlos Savala. The documents did not state where
Martinez and Savala were based.</TE>
<TE>   According to the affidavits, Martinez, whom applicants knew as
"Jessica," and Savala arranged for applicants to apply for licenses
and take the written test at DMV offices in Bakersfield, Hollywood
and San Clemente using fake birth certificates.</TE>
<TE>   They typically charged $1,200, but some were charged as much as
$1,800, according to the documents.</TE>
<TE>   That price included $200 to $300 to guarantee that applicants
passed a driving test, which was conducted at the Santa Paula office.
Mejia-Luna administered those behind-the-wheel tests, the documents
state.</TE>
<TE>   On at least one occasion, she was observed taking money from the
car's console when the test was complete, the documents state.</TE>
<TE>   In all six cases, the documents state, DMV records show that
Mejia-Luna updated computer records to indicate each person had
passed the driving test.</TE>
<TE>   That information was then sent to the agency's Sacramento
headquarters.</TE>

<HD>Music Center's 'Bravo' Goes to a Multi-Tasking Maestro</HD>
<DH>Arts: Orange High School choir teacher, band leader and
dynamo Mike Short is honored for his work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Music, they say, can transport you.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday evening, it took Mike Short, an Orange choir teacher,
from a cramped high school classroom where he has taught for 20 years
to the glow of the spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   Short, 45, is this year's winner of the Bravo Award for
outstanding arts teacher, presented by the Music Center of Los
Angeles County.</LD>
<TE>   The 20-year-old award was created to promote arts education in
Southern California's private and public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Judges select winners in three categories: exceptional school,
arts teacher and general-subjects teacher who incorporates the arts
into the academic curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   Short, who teaches at Orange High School, pushes to bring music
classes to children of all experience and ability levels, even
pitching in to teach an early morning band class for no extra pay.</TE>
<TE>   Other winners were Arcadia High School in Los Angeles County as
exceptional school, and Laura Hamlett, 32, a second-grade teacher at
Eagle Rock Elementary School in Los Angeles as general-subjects
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   For Short, chosen from 30 nominated arts teachers, the award means
recognition--plus $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how people say a few people do all the work? Well, Mike
is one of the few," said Orange High Principal Robert Lewis, who
nominated Short and accompanied him to the awards ceremony, along
with Short's family and school district officials. "The guy goes a
thousand miles an hour."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when the school lost its band teacher, Short stepped in
to save the program by volunteering to come in early and teach the
class, Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   The district plans to hire a new band teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, Short and a middle-school teacher proposed
reintroducing arts education to elementary schools.</TE>
<TE>   They worked on curricula, giving the district board several
spending options. Trustees agreed to spend $750,000 a year on the
program.</TE>
<TE>   Short's energy was evident one recent morning during a concert
choir class at the high school.</TE>
<TE>   Young voices spilled from the classroom. Inside, 35 boys and 53
girls formed a semicircle around Short, who, dressed in jeans and
cowboy boots, was warming up the students' vocal cords.</TE>
<TE>   "Louder, louder," Short urged as his aide, Caryl Smith,
accompanied on piano.</TE>
<TE>   The room was crammed with computer and music equipment, file
cabinets, boxes of sheet music and 20 years of memories, including a
1999 theatrical poster for a Russian production of the musical
"Hair." The show starred one of his students. "He didn't even speak
Russian," Short said. Along the walls were pictures of his graduating
classes, each a little larger, each a little more ethnically diverse,
chronicling the changing demographics of the working-class community
surrounding the school.</TE>
<TE>   The day's repertoire included an African song and Robert Ray's
"Lord Have Mercy," a gospel score.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year we did Vivaldi's 'Gloria,'" Short said. "I want them to
explore lots of different styles, from medieval to contemporary.
Notice I said 'contemporary,' not 'pop.' They get enough of that on
their own time."</TE>
<TE>   From football players to band members, the students follow his
hand gestures and coaching advice.</TE>
<TE>   During a section of "Lord Have Mercy," the tenors struggled with a
tone change. Short had them try various tricks; none worked until he
told them to imagine they were sticking their heads out the window of
a car and singing into the wind.</TE>
<TE>   Giggles filled the room, but in perfect unison, heads bobbed to
the side as the students traveled in the imaginary car and hit the
note. More giggles.</TE>
<TE>   "Did that work?" Short asked the class. Heads bobbed.</TE>
<TE>   Short doesn't want his students to mimic sounds, he said. "My job
is to help them create. Music is about creating."</TE>
<TE>   It is also about exploring. Not just musical horizons, but
geographic landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   Short helps his students expand beyond their world by sponsoring
singing trips abroad every four years, and to other parts of the
country every two years. His students have performed at Notre Dame
cathedral in Paris and in Belgium and London.</TE>
<TE>   His students pay what they can, and the rest comes from
fund-raisers that Short coordinates. This year, the class is going to
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Every student who works hard in his class and volunteers in
fund-raising efforts, such as selling tickets for their performances,
wins a spot on the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll guarantee you, you will go," Short told students. "And I
haven't been made a liar yet."</TE>
<TE>   The Ardmore, Okla., native fell in love with choral music at 14,
he said, when he visited the First Southern Baptist Church in
Bakersfield, where he was living at the time.</TE>
<TE>   That led to a degree in vocal music education from Orange's
Chapman University in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Music fills his life. His wife, Vicki Sue, plays the piano, flute
and violin. His 11-year-old son, Matthew, plays violin and piano. His
daughter, Katherine, 14, is in Orange High's choir, band and dance
class.</TE>
<TE>   Short also directs Orange's Community Choir, which performs at
city's events, and the choir at his church, the First United
Methodist Church of Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "Multi-tasking, that's my life," Short said. "I don't know how it
all fits together, but it does."</TE>

<HD>Owner Plans to Revive Historic Town's Plaza</HD>
<DH>Design: Developer hopes theater and outdoor dining will
spruce up downtown San Juan Capistrano.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Busk isn't looking to turn downtown San Juan Capistrano into
Carmel or Old Pasadena. But he would like to breathe a little more
life into the historic district where the sidewalks are traditionally
rolled up around sundown.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great place, it's got a lot of history," Busk said. "But
it needs ... a little more nightlife."</LD>
<LD>   Busk is the latest owner of downtown's biggest dead spot:
Franciscan Plaza, an uninviting Spanish-style tri-level across the
street from the 200-year-old mission and about 20 yards from the
picturesque train depot. A five-screen movie complex in the
45,000-square-foot plaza has been vacant for two years. Many of the
shops are gone.</LD>
<TE>   But Busk--the soured economy and a downsizing theater industry
notwithstanding--is betting about $3.5 million that the sleepy
Franciscan can be turned into a centerpiece for nighttime action in a
neighborhood of old adobes, small museums and gift shops.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the money will be poured into the multiplex, the center's
most obvious failure. Busk believes an upscale theater complex--he
plans to call it Mission Cinema De Luxe--will bring in the after-dark
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The theater's $1-million renovation is expected to be completed by
mid-May. The developer also plans two upscale restaurants with
outdoor seating, spruced-up quarters for an existing diner, an ice
cream shop and a makeover for the building's plaza. He's aiming to
have the work done by spring 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The developer said his first order of business in San Juan is to
change the center's karma. He can't move the building, but he can
change its name and appearance. When it reopens, it will be called
Mission Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   So far, city officials have been receptive to Busk's plans. Other
business owners have their doubts, however.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Nordeck, who owns the nearby Swallow's Inn tavern and once
tried to buy the plaza, said he would have demolished the theater
long ago and replaced it with a hotel or upscale shops.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody went to the theater," said Nordeck, who also owns the
historic district's Mission Promenade. "It was a ghost town. If I
owned that property, a theater is the last use I'd have for that
building."</TE>
<TE>   Busk, who specializes in building custom homes, is the fourth
person to own the Franciscan in 12 years. Other grand dreams have
gone up in smoke, and until recently, Busk was among those who
thought the theater should just be torn down.</TE>
<TE>   Once Edwards Cinemas pulled out and no other chain was willing to
take over, Busk said he figured he had no option but to raze the
cinema. City officials and residents, he said, helped change his
mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I came to the conclusion that a theater is one of the retail
pillars of downtown," said Busk, who also owns an adjacent 350-space
parking structure and the Juan Avila adobe, one of the city's oldest
homes. "It creates a vibrancy for after-hours and evening hours."</TE>
<TE>   Busk plans to show first-run features in two of the theaters,
independent films in two others and foreign releases in a fifth. He
even envisions a touch of Hollywood in old San Juan.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping to roll out the red carpet from the train station to
the theater for independent film actors who come down here for
premieres," Busk said. "We'd like to shut down Verdugo Street for a
night, put up some bleachers and have a couple hundred people
greeting the stars."</TE>
<TE>   City officials said Busk needs to keep a sense of balance as he
moves forward. The town is proud of its historic downtown and
protective of its small-town charm.</TE>
<TE>   "Downtown is appealing because of its history and its
pedestrian-friendly look," said Mayor Diane Bathgate. "And we want to
retain that."</TE>
<TE>   Busk said that he understands the challenge. "Turning San Juan
into a tourist town isn't where we're at," he said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials are optimistic, though cautiously so.</TE>
<TE>   "He definitely is a visionary," said Douglas Dumhart, manager of
the city's redevelopment agency. "That kind of dreamer might bring
some new interest into the town."</TE>
<TE>   Nordeck said he has his doubts, but he wishes his business
neighbor well.</TE>
<TE>   "I admire Busk's tenacity, and I hope I'm wrong about this,"
Nordeck said. "I would love to see a success story over there."</TE>

<HD>Brass Knuckles Led Police to Suspect in Bank Heists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gleaming pair of brass knuckles seized during a late-night traffic
stop led to the arrest of the "Butterfingers Bandit," believed
responsible for two dozen bank robberies in Los Angeles and the Santa
Clarita and Antelope valleys, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Harris Wright, 32, of Los Angeles was being held at
the federal detention center in downtown Los Angeles without bail
after his arrest Thursday on suspicion of robbery. He is scheduled to
appear in court March 11.</LD>
<LD>   A second man, 33-year-old Peter Lavaty, was arrested on suspicion
of possessing brass knuckles, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The robber was nicknamed by police for his involvement in a series
of robberies in which witnesses said he dropped cash at two west San
Fernando Valley bank branches and a demand note at a third Valley
crime scene, said Laura Bosley, an FBI spokeswoman. In those cases,
Bosley said, apparently fearful witnesses helped him scoop up cash
and the note while exiting the banks.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe Wright committed two dozen bank robberies,
one each in Santa Clarita and Lancaster and the rest in Los Angeles.
Authorities said no one was hurt in the crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The 24 robberies took place from Nov. 3, 2001, to Feb. 15, 2002. A
break in the case came Thursday night when officers with the LAPD's
Devonshire Division Special Enforcement unit pulled over a car that
Wright was driving during a routine traffic stop at Roscoe Boulevard
and Louise Street in Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   During the stop, an officer noticed a pair of brass knuckles in
the car that allegedly belonged to Lavaty, authorities said. A
further search turned up unspecified evidence related to the bank
robberies, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Upon further investigation, police said they saw similarities
between Wright and the Butterfingers Bandit.</TE>

<HD>Ailing Youth Dies on Way to School</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Teenager with muscular dystrophy stopped breathing
on bus to Francis Polytechnic High.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 16-year-old Pacoima youth stopped breathing on a school bus Monday
morning and was pronounced dead an hour later at a hospital,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Vitela, a sophomore at John H. Francis Polytechnic High
School, had muscular dystrophy and was in declining health, according
to his uncle Enrique Garcia.</LD>
<LD>   The bus was en route to the Sun Valley school when the driver
noticed that Jose wasn't breathing. The youth was taken by ambulance
to Pacifica Hospital of the Valley, where he was pronounced dead
shortly after 8 a.m., Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Bob
Collis said.</LD>
<TE>   "When paramedics arrived, the boy was in full cardiac arrest,"
Collis said.</TE>
<TE>   A school nurse and psychologist told Jose's classmates of his
death. Assistant Principal Dan Scharf said a team of counselors also
was sent to the school.</TE>
<TE>   Scharf described Jose as "a very affable young man with a
wonderful, winsome smile." He said the boy enjoyed woodworking class
and rode his wheelchair around the campus "not exactly speeding, but
definitely quickly. He would be high-fiving whoever and whatever
along the way."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, 15-year-old Ricardo Martinez collapsed in a locker room
at Van Nuys High School a few miles away and died at a hospital. The
results of an autopsy were inconclusive in that case, Los Angeles
County coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said Monday. Toxicology
tests are still pending, Carrier said.</TE>

<HD>Court Hears Appeal in Compton Dispute</HD>
<DH>Election: Attorneys argue about the ballot-listing theory
that led a judge to overturn the results in the city's bitter mayoral
race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The legal battle over Compton's recent election moved to an appeals
court Monday, where lawyers traded barbs over the "primacy effect"
theory that swayed a judge to oust Mayor Eric Perrodin from office.</LD>
<LD>   In an unprecedented decision earlier this month, Los Angeles
Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin replaced Perrodin with his
opponent, Omar Bradley, after ruling that Perrodin had unfairly
benefited from being listed first on the ballot in last year's
election.</LD>
<LD>   Perrodin's attorney, Frederic Woocher, said at the hearing that
Chirlin's decision relied on the flawed testimony of a political
scientist who misapplied the primacy effect theory and did little
research to support his findings.</LD>
<TE>   Perrodin wants the appeals court to suspend Chirlin's ruling and
reinstate him as mayor until a decision is reached on the appeal.
Chirlin had ruled that the candidates' names were not listed lawfully
on the June 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not science. It's not even political science," said Woocher,
referring to the theory. "The Superior Court had no warrant for
taking 306 votes and giving them to [Bradley] at the stroke of a
pen."</TE>
<TE>   Bradley's attorney, Bradley W. Hertz, defended the testimony of
the expert witness, Ohio State University professor Jon Krosnick,
saying that Krosnick's research was exhaustive, detailed and
accurate.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not junk science. It is not fuzzy math," Hertz said.
"Everyone should get a fair shake with every new election."</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin's name did not appear first on last year's primary
ballot, but it did appear before Bradley's. It also appeared before
Bradley's on the ballot for the June runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Chirlin ruled that the city clerk improperly lifted the name order
off the primary ballot, instead of using a method to randomly select
the order. Perrodin's position on the second ballot, the judge said,
gave him an improper statistical advantage that won him at least 306
votes, enough to prevail in the close race.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing at the 2nd District Court of Appeal in downtown Los
Angeles was held in a courtroom crowded with about 90 supporters of
both Perrodin and Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin argues that Compton will suffer irreparable harm if
Bradley remains in office while his appeal is pending. He fears that
Bradley will use taxpayers' money to pay as much as $1 million of his
attorney fees and back wages.</TE>
<TE>   The Compton City Council is scheduled to discuss several claims by
Bradley and his attorney at today's council meeting. Bradley has said
that he will recuse himself from discussions or votes on those
matters.</TE>
<TE>   Though the three appellate justices did not reach a decision
Monday--a ruling is expected sometime this week--they did question
Hertz several times, asking for clarification and posing hypothetical
situations.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Associate Justice Reuben Ortega asked Hertz if he
thought that all elections are now suspect because of the primacy
effect, which holds that people tend to favor choices at the top of a
list.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley said that not all races were flawed, but that some with
narrow margins of victory could be open to challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Presiding Justice Vaino Spencer questioned why the primacy effect
didn't make a difference in Compton's primary election, where the
first candidate on the ballot, Basil Kimbrew, trailed far behind
Perrodin and Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   She also wanted to know how much research the expert witness had
done, and questioned if Krosnick's analysis, based on an Ohio study,
was relevant to Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Hertz did not say exactly how much time Krosnick spent on his
analysis, but said it was thorough. He said that the primacy effect
theory always holds, but that it varies from place to place.</TE>
<TE>   Woocher scoffed at his explanations.</TE>
<TE>   "It just points out the absurdity of relying on that information
to overturn the will of the people," he said.</TE>

<HD>MTA Driver Pleads Guilty to Molesting Boys</HD>
<DH>Crime: Recent incident aboard bus was captured on
videotape. Two other victims were family friends molested in late
'70s, early '80s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An MTA bus driver pleaded guilty Monday to a molesting a teenage boy
aboard his bus and to sexually assaulting a police officer and his
brother when they were minors two decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   Clasping his hands in front of his face as if praying, Anthony
Zaragoza, 49, entered guilty pleas to a dozen felony counts under a
deal that will see him sentenced to nearly 30 years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   The 325-pound bus driver seemed a pale shadow of the man portrayed
as a sexual predator by prosecutors as he sat with his eyes often
shut and replied "yes" as Deputy Dist. Atty. Christina Weiss read the
felony counts. The charges included lewd conduct with a minor,
attempted forced oral copulation and false imprisonment.</LD>
<TE>   Zaragoza at one point tried to plead no contest, but was rebuffed
by the prosecutor who told him the plea agreement required a guilty
plea.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Superior Judge Craig Veals told him the plea amounted
to the same as no contest and at one point asked if the bus driver
understood the proceeding. "I understand what is going on," said
Zaragoza, glancing at the audience. Under state law, he will serve at
least 19 years of the sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "I know for the next 20 years, young boys will be safe from a
creep like him," said a 33-year-old man who, along with his brother,
now a police officer, was molested by Zaragoza in the late 1970s and
early 1980s. "I was very pleased with the sentence, but it will never
take away what I lost," the man said.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss said the plea was fair. "He faced more than 43 years in
prison. This is a guy who I had on tape committing one of the crimes
and confessing to the others in an interview. He knew he'd get the
maximum if it went to trial," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   "This man was a coward from beginning to end, and he hid his face
out of shame," she said, referring to how Zaragoza held his hands in
front of his face during the proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   A father of three, Zaragoza was a Little League coach, a football
coach and a Big Brother, often mentoring students, authorities said.
But he was also convicted in the 1980s of felony robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The Quartz Hill resident was arrested last year after molesting a
15-year-old North Carolina boy on his Metropolitan Transportation
Authority bus. The boy was visiting an uncle in Pasadena when he took
the bus to Hollywood last June and captured the incident on
videotape.</TE>
<TE>   With the camera pointing down, the boy pressed the "on" button
after Zaragoza began to talk to him about sex. The bus driver is
heard trying to persuade the boy to engage in sex as the boy
protests. "I could pin you to the floor and take your pants off
without you stopping me," Zaragoza said. "But I wouldn't hurt you,
sweetheart."</TE>
<TE>   After Zaragoza fondled him, the boy escaped by promising to come
back the next day. In a taped interview with detectives, Zaragoza
admitted touching the North Carolina teenager and other boys "two or
three times," calling it a "sporadic thing."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Zaragoza's arrest, the police officer and his
brother came forward. As a 13-year-old in 1979, the officer with his
11-year-old brother met Zaragoza, and he became a family friend and
the boys' godfather.</TE>
<TE>   The officer testified at a preliminary hearing that on one
overnight stay at Zaragoza's home, Zaragoza forced the boy to touch
him below the waist.</TE>
<TE>   The younger brother testified that he was molested by Zaragoza the
first day they met, in April 1979, and at least eight other times at
various locations, from a Montebello transit station to a Motel 6.</TE>
<TE>   Zaragoza was convicted in 1980 of felony robbery and sentenced to
a year in jail and three years' probation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, he used a state law that allows defendants convicted of a
felony and not given a state prison sentence the right to have their
conviction reduced to a misdemeanor. He also succeeded in getting
that conviction expunged from his record in January 1989.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA's predecessor, the Southern California Rapid Transit
District, knew of Zaragoza's conviction when it hired him as a
part-time driver in February 1989.</TE>
<TE>   But MTA officials said that since the criminal record had been
expunged, it technically did not exist, and the agency could not,
under state law, deny him employment because of it.</TE>

<HD>Waxman Says Video Contradicts Skilling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Enron Corp. Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling vigorously
defended the company's accounting methods to employees more than a
year ago as "appropriate" and "conservatively executed" and lauded
the same type of off-balance-sheet partnerships that would eventually
spur the energy-trading giant's collapse, a video obtained by
congressional investigators shows.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) on Monday released a
transcript of the comments, which were recorded at an Oct. 3, 2000,
company meeting. Waxman said the comments appeared to bluntly
contradict Skilling's testimony to lawmakers this month and sent
Skilling a letter asking for an explanation.</LD>
<LD>   Skilling is scheduled to testify today before the Senate Commerce
Committee, and Waxman said he has forwarded the letter to Sen. Ernest
F. Hollings (D-S.C.), the committee chairman.</LD>
<TE>   Skilling "seems to have known a lot more than he let on when he
testified," Waxman said in an interview. "We hope [the Senate
committee] will pursue some of these issues. I think Mr. Skilling has
a lot of questions to answer."</TE>
<TE>   In a testimony to a House panel Feb. 7, Skilling--who served as
Enron's chief executive for six months last year--insisted the
company was "solvent and highly profitable" when he abruptly resigned
in August. He said he "was not aware of any inappropriate financing
arrangements designed to conceal liabilities or overstate earnings."</TE>
<TE>   A transcript of the employee meeting, however, indicates that
Skilling was familiar with allegations that Enron's accounting
tactics masked losses. The matter was raised when an employee
questioned Skilling about a Sept. 20, 2000, Wall Street Journal
article critical of aggressive "mark-to-market" accounting by Enron
and some other energy companies.</TE>
<TE>   The technique allows companies to book as current earnings profit
that it expects to earn over the course of long-term contracts. In
cases in which future market conditions are highly uncertain--such as
with electricity--Enron based the value of the deals on its own often
overly optimistic models. Although the technique is legal, Enron's
use of it has been criticized by analysts, former executives and
others as misleading in the months since the energy trader filed for
bankruptcy protection Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal article raised those concerns more than a
year earlier, noting that Enron would have reported a second-quarter
loss if not for $747 million booked in anticipated, but as yet
unrealized, gains from "risk management activities." But Skilling
dismissed the concerns as "totally, totally without merit."</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, we provide more data in our annual report than
anyone else in our industry and more data than anyone in any
transaction-based industry," Skilling said in the video, according to
the transcript. "Our accounting policies are not only appropriate, in
my opinion, they're conservatively executed."</TE>
<TE>   At the same meeting, Skilling also described how the company
planned to bring in partners to help leverage its capital in its new
Enron Net Works division, according to the transcript, and do so "in
a way that minimizes the impact on Enron's balance sheet."</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Waxman said the comments make it sound as though
Skilling was "endorsing exactly the same kind of off-balance-sheet
partnerships that contributed to Enron's downfall."</TE>
<TE>   Skilling's attorney, Bruce A. Hiler, issued a statement Monday
declining to "respond to every inquiry and attempt to draw
unsubstantiated conclusions from each new piece of information that
comes available about Enron."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers today are expected to ask Skilling to explain what they
say are contradictions between his testimony to the House panel and
that of other Enron executives, who say he knew details of the
partnerships. Among those are Vice President Sherron S. Watkins, who
first warned former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay about the problems last
summer, and current President Jeffrey McMahon, who as treasurer said
he raised concerns with Skilling about the partnerships. Both are
scheduled to testify today as well.</TE>

<HD>Bidding War for Global Crossing?</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The onetime fiber-optic highflier says several
potential buyers are discussing options.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The much-maligned $750-million deal that two Asian companies are
offering for control of Global Crossing Ltd. is looking like the
opening salvo in what both shareholders and corporate executives hope
will be a bidding war for the world's most extensive network of
fiber-optic cable.</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing, which filed the fourth-largest bankruptcy
petition in U.S. history last month after putting $15 billion into
100,000 miles of cable connecting 27 countries, said several bidders
have stepped forward already to discuss possible options, but
declined to name them. Companies such as AT&amp;T Corp., Verizon
Communications and BellSouth Corp., along with such international
concerns as Japan's NTT and British powerhouse Cable &amp; Wireless, are
seen as among the healthiest to pursue Global's lines.</LD>
<LD>   "Global Crossing's assets were at one time considered to be the
best in the industry," said analyst Michael Hodel at Morningstar Inc.
in Chicago. "I'd be surprised if there isn't someone around who would
make a better offer to buy the assets."</LD>
<TE>   But with only 40% of about 12 million miles of fiber-optic cable
being used, some telecommunications companies are finding it
difficult to raise cash, weaker ones are folding, and stronger ones
may not think the time is right--or ever will be.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is pressed by this glut of bandwidth," said researcher
Ted Chamberlain at Gartner Inc. in Stamford, Conn. "But the future is
not going to be in pure bandwidth. It's going to be in Web hosting
and other services that will be provided over the bandwidth."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he and other analysts expect that Global Crossing's
network will attract a company--or a group of firms--interested not
only in future capacity but in state-of-the-art technology.</TE>
<TE>   "There are companies that can absorb this network, but the first
question is who needs it," said telecom researcher David Cooperstein
at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. "A Sprint, possibly,
or BellSouth. Potentially, Verizon."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts agree that the so-called Baby Bells are in better
financial shape and more in need of long-distance capacity than
long-haul carriers such as AT&amp;T, which has its own worldwide network.</TE>
<TE>   None of the potential suitors will comment specifically on Global
Crossing assets, but they also are quick to point out that they are
prepared to buy. Just last week, AT&amp;T said it has a $5-billion
securities offering on the shelf and ready for use at any time,
particularly for acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T has said that it would evaluate "distressed assets" to see if
they are worth acquiring, said company spokeswoman Eileen Connolly.
"If so, we certainly would consider buying at the right price."</TE>
<TE>   Verizon, the biggest of the regional Bells and the furthest along
in clearing the path for long-distance service for customers in 32
states, isn't pursuing Global Crossing assets "right now," said
spokeswoman Julia Wilson, "but our eyes are always open to
opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Sprint Corp., BellSouth and Pacific Bell parent SBC
Communications Inc. say Global's assets are not priorities for them.</TE>
<TE>   A likely scenario would be for an international partnership to
pick up the network, said analyst Chamberlain. But partnerships are
often tough to work out. "Cable &amp; Wireless could make a good bid with
AT&amp;T, but they compete with each other on Web hosting," he said. "The
market is so incestuous that for every purchase and partnership you
make, you're jeopardizing another. This [sale] is going to be a
mess."</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Patrick Comack at Guzman &amp; Co. in Miami worries that
Global's executives may have got the best deal possible with Hong
Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and partner Singapore
Technologies Telemedia. "It may be that nobody is ready to buy now
because of the weak industry," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Comack, Hodel and other analysts say they were shocked
at the low bid that Global executives filed as part of a
reorganization plan. Under the deal, the two Asian companies would
put in $375 million in cash each for 79% of the company. General
creditors would get $300 million in cash plus $800 million in debt
securities for 21% of the company, while bond holders and
shareholders would get nothing. In its petition, Global listed assets
of $22.4 billion and debts of $12.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a group of shareholders led by boutique international
investment house K.A.B. Group put forth an unusual plan to sell
warrants and raise as much as $5.5 billion over three years in a bid
to repay all creditors. The proposal was quickly panned by analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Global's unsecured creditors committee is seeking
information about insider stock sales, executive benefits and swaps
of fiber-optic capacity with other firms in the 12 months before the
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in January. The questions, usual in
large bankruptcies, seek to determine if fraud has occurred and the
gains could be captured for creditors.</TE>
<TE>   In other Global Crossing developments, Global Crossing Chairman
Gary Winnick resigned Friday from the board of Singapore investment
firm K1 Ventures, in which he and fellow Global director Steven J.
Green invested $12.5 million each. Green, a former ambassador to
Singapore, remains chairman and chief executive of K1.</TE>
<TE>   The government-controlled Temasek Holdings owns a third of a
company that, in turn, owns 41% of K1. Temasek also owns Singapore
Technologies. Winnick spokesman Michael Sitrick said Winnick no
longer has time to devote to K1, though he remains an investor.</TE>

<DH>Economy: Merchants in need of a comeback are hoping two
very special new Dodger hurlers can help rally visitor spending to
pre-attack levels.</DH>

<LD>When the Dodgers introduced their newest team members earlier this
month, the usual throng of reporters and fans were there--along with
a horde of 40 Japanese tour operators. They snapped pictures and
fetched autographs of Kazuhisa Ishii and Hideo Nomo, sizing them up
for a lot more than 90-mph fastballs.</LD>
<LD>   In their minds, the soft-spoken Ishii and well-known Nomo may be
just what it takes to help lure wary Japanese visitors back to
California this year.</LD>
<LD>   "If it plays out the way we're hoping, baseball will be our savior
in this tourism slump," said Ko Ueno, director of Japanese travel for
the California Division of Tourism, noting that Japan attaches
rock-star status to its players in the U.S. "If anything can get the
Japanese visitors back here quickly, it will be baseball. It could
make a big, big difference in that market's recovery."</LD>
<TE>   In Japan, travel officials said baseball could very well help
soothe consumer jitters about traveling to America. Haruko Komiya, a
28-year-old resident of Tokyo, said she traded a trip to the U.S. for
Hong Kong over the holidays, but is feeling better about traveling
now--especially with Ishii beckoning.</TE>
<TE>   "Seeing Ishii go to the Dodgers is great," Komiya said. "It might
be another good reason to go to Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese have been, by far, the biggest tourist group to
California; more than a million visitors spent an estimated $1.2
billion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But last year, after Sept. 11, travel to the United States from
Japan dropped more than 50%. The Japanese are said to be particularly
risk-averse travelers, and their slow return has been felt at theme
parks, hotels, restaurants and shops throughout Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "They are just beginning to test the water again, but only with
one toe," said Ueno. "They're not ready to jump in all the way yet."</TE>
<TE>   Some airlines are starting to add service between Los Angeles and
Japan--Japan Airlines, for example, will go from eight flights to 10
beginning Friday--but the overall number of flights are still way
down. The U.S. Commerce Department says Japan visitation to the U.S.
may not return to its 2000 numbers until late 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co. officials said the drop-off in Japanese and other
international tourists is continuing to hurt attendance at theme
parks. And places like the Desert Hills Premium Outlets near Palm
Springs, which relies heavily on overseas tourists, said the number
of Japanese groups in 2002 is no better than 25% what it was a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some signs that things are improving, and we're getting
a few more tours coming in each week than even last month," said
Scott Georges, marketing director at the New Otani hotel in Little
Tokyo in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Downturn Forces Some Austerity Measures</TE>
<TE>   The 434-room hotel relies on Japanese visitors for more than half
of its total guests, Georges said, but occupancy is hovering at just
50%. Recently the hotel cut its restaurant hours, let go of the piano
player in the lobby and replaced fresh flower arrangements with
artificial look-alikes. "It's still very slow," he said. "Very
quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Which is why Japanese tour operators are buzzing about Ishii, who
signed a $12-million contract with the Dodgers this month, and Nomo,
who has rejoined the team after playing here several years ago, and
who in his debut with the Dodgers in 1995 created "Nomo-mania" here
and in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps nowhere are the spring hopes as high as in Little Tokyo,
which has been devastated by the loss of Japanese tourists. Koji
Tanaka, who manages a clothing boutique in the Onizuka Plaza, said
he'll support any attempt to get people shopping again.</TE>
<TE>   Although he just opened Zin Design in January, Tanaka has already
seen at least three businesses close down around him, including a
coffee shop, a jewelry store and a minimarket. On a recent weekday
lunch hour, he glanced at the boarded-up windows and vacant sidewalks
that snake through the courtyard, and frowned.</TE>
<TE>   "We opened at the wrong time, and maybe in the wrong location,"
Tanaka said. "If something can be done to bring back the customers, I
would be grateful."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Lee, who manages the Shinyodo &amp; Hollywood Shop in the
Japanese Village Plaza, said he can hardly wait for the baseball
season. Seven years ago, when Nomo first splashed onto the scene with
the Dodgers, Lee said his business swelled at least 25%. Nowadays
most of his customers are local--and their wallets are thin, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm waiting it out, like I always do," said Lee, who sells
designer purses, jewelry and souvenirs. "When I talk to some of the
Japanese tourists who do come in, they are hopeful. So I'm hopeful
too."</TE>
<TE>   The tour operators who descended on Dodger Stadium two weeks ago
wanted to meet Ishii and formulate package deals for Japanese
visitors that include one or two Dodger games in Los Angeles and a
swing through San Francisco, Orange County or San Diego. The baseball
games will be broadcast live in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Yukio Fujimoto, general manager of the Japan Travel Bureau in Los
Angeles, said all the hype may help bring Japanese tourism to within
65% of what it was last spring and 90% by summer's end.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need to do is show Japan that things are back to normal
now and they should come to California," said Fujimoto, whose company
is the largest organizer of Japanese leisure travelers to Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "How much more normal can you get than baseball?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marketing Plan Will Be Put Into Play</TE>
<TE>   For further reassurance, the Japan Travel Bureau in Tokyo said it
plans to start promoting West Coast destinations, hopefully in a
partnership with the public and private sectors.</TE>
<TE>   "Trips to the U.S. West Coast are already discounted so much, we
can't go any lower," said spokesman Tsuneo Nishiyama. "So we're
trying to promote a Major League Baseball tour."</TE>
<TE>   Tourist officials also have launched a promotion in Japan in which
50 couples can win all-expense-paid trips to California in
April--providing they answer a short quiz (the answers spell out
C-A-L-I-F-O-R-N-I-A) and their entry is plucked from a drawing. So
far, 10,000 entries have been turned in to the 1,300 members of the
Japanese Assn. of Travel Agents.</TE>
<TE>   "We've started a campaign to publicize comments by people who've
gone" to the United States, said Junko Yoshida, a spokeswoman at HIS
Travel Agency in Tokyo. "Things like, 'It was really inexpensive,' or
'It was much safer than I thought,' or even 'New Yorkers are starting
to get on with their ordinary lives again.' These give people
reassurance."</TE>
<TE>   And Ishii, for his part, may be helping the state's tourism
industry without even knowing it. At the introductory news conference
two weeks ago, the 28-year-old gushed about why he chose the Dodgers:
"There is good weather and golf courses here ... because I am a
Californian."</TE>
<TE>   Tourism officials swooned.</TE>
<TE>   "Atta boy," exclaimed Ueno. "You go."</TE>

<HD>Kirch Assets Sale May Keep Media Group Alive</HD>
<DH>Europe: Debt-laden German firm's holdings include
publishing stake, car racing TV rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>He may be ostracized and on the brink of bankruptcy, but German media
mogul Leo Kirch is like a wounded bear, weakened but with claws sharp
enough to hurt.</LD>
<LD>   The reclusive 75-year-old has made a career of squirming out of
tight spots created by his complex financial deals and indifference
to debt. Despite predictions only a few weeks ago that his empire may
collapse, Kirch is hoping to prove that he is the consummate
survivor.</LD>
<LD>   If he fails, it would have a ripple effect. The default of Kirch
Group loans could trigger a German financial crisis as seven banks,
led by Bayerische Landesbank, could lose billions of dollars.</LD>
<TE>   A collapse also would hurt conservatives' chances in the September
elections, particularly in Bavaria, which owns half of Landesbank.</TE>
<TE>   Kirch has maintained a low profile and is not talking during the
negotiations to save his operations. His latest and most precarious
crisis was caused by nearly half of his $7 billion in short-term
debts and buyback options falling due as the global slump in
advertising slashed the income and value of his myriad holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Kirch and his lieutenants, ruling over a kingdom of 150 operations
under three divisions of Kirch Group, have signaled in recent days
that they will try to sell some prime assets to earn cash for some
big bills due in April. He is heavily invested in television, making
rival Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp., a potential suitor. On
Monday, Kirch Group appointed a three-member panel to advise on
reorganizing the media businesses' $5.7-billion debt.</TE>
<TE>   Among Kirch Group's stellar holdings on the block are a 40% stake
in publishing behemoth Axel Springer Verlag and controlling rights to
broadcast Formula One racing, one of the sporting world's
most-watched events.</TE>
<TE>   Media here report that an undisclosed group of German investors is
talking about paying $960 million for the shares in Springer,
publisher of Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper and several
other periodicals that generate $2.6 billion in sales a year. That
would just about cover a $400-million loan soon due to Dresdner Bank
and a $669-million "put" option activated by Springer that requires
Kirch Group to buy back the publisher's 1999 investment at what is
now more than seven times its market value.</TE>
<TE>   But Formula One is an asset Kirch Group will have trouble tapping
in the short term. The group borrowed most of the $1.8-billion cost
of its 58% stake when Kirch Group acquired it from SLEC Holdings,
owner of the television rights to the racing circuit. Kirch won't get
any of the profit from Formula One broadcasting until SLEC pays off a
$1.4-billion bond, which could take until 2005. The auto makers that
run racing teams have threatened to start their own circuit when
their contract with SLEC runs out in 2007.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Kirch Group staves off collapse by divesting its Springer
shares and Formula One stake, it faces an even steeper put option
that must be exercised by British Sky Broadcasting, a News Corp.
subsidiary, for $1.4 million by October.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations between Kirch and Murdoch broke down two weeks ago on
a deal to settle the debt with Kirch Group assets, probably the Kirch
Pay-TV company that loses $69.6 million a month and forces Kirch
Group to keep slurping from the credit trough to pay for programming
rights.</TE>
<TE>   But industry analysts believe Murdoch is interested in parlaying
Kirch Group's obligation--which company officials have acknowledged
they cannot pay--into a News Corp. foothold in the German media
market, which accounts for 30% of industry revenue in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch reportedly was in Germany last week, but he would not
discuss the status of talks.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Kirch Pay-TV is in need of at least a $1.7-billion
infusion to upgrade its antiquated technology and uninspiring
offerings, Merrill Lynch media analyst Bernard Tubeileh in Frankfurt,
Germany, said Murdoch had the kind of deep pockets to make a go of
pay TV in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone like Murdoch could do something with pay TV here. He has
the money to invest, and without investment in the infrastructure, it
will never take off," said Tubeileh, noting that German viewers get
more than 30 channels free and will be tempted to subscribe to pay TV
only if a broader range of services is included.</TE>
<TE>   Kirch Group's Premiere cable network has managed to attract only
about 2.4 million subscribers--far below the 4 million promised to
Murdoch and other investors by this time. Kirch Group's failure to
deliver viewers and meet other benchmarks laid out three years ago
has enabled Murdoch to employ his buyback option.</TE>
<TE>   As a private company, Kirch Group is under little obligation to
open its books to auditors, so even the conglomerate's biggest
creditors are unsure of the extent of its debts and obligations. A
cursory investigation into Kirch Group's solvency by a group of its
creditor banks has produced more dire estimates of Kirch Group's
obligations, German newspapers reported last week, quoting unnamed
banking sources. The report said debts exceed $11.3 billion, more
than the company's estimated value, although that too is shrouded in
secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   Most vulnerable to a total collapse of Kirch Group is its biggest
lender, Bayerische Landesbank, which holds $1.65 million in loans
outstanding to the group. The state bank is further back in the
payment schedule than Dresdner and other creditors, with the next
unspecified installment due late this year.</TE>
<TE>   It also has less solid collateral than Deutsche Bank, whose loans
are secured by Kirch Group's Springer stake.</TE>
<TE>   As a native Bavarian and longtime friend of former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and his conservative Christian Democratic Union, Kirch
for years found the Bavarian bank--controlled by the conservative
political establishment--to be generous beyond all reason.</TE>
<TE>   But now that Bavarian Gov. Edmund Stoiber, head of the state
sister party to the Christian Democratic Union, has been chosen as
the conservative challenger to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in the
Sept. 22 federal election, neither the bank nor Stoiber can afford to
lend money on such a good-old-boy basis.</TE>
<TE>   A Kirch Group collapse and the thousands of jobs that would be
lost with it would seriously undermine Stoiber's claims to have built
a vibrant modern state economy while the rest of Germany is mired in
recession. But neither would a Kirch Group debacle and subsequent
banking crises at the state and national level do any good for Social
Democrat Schroeder, who already is under fire for allowing
unemployment to return to the level of 4 million people.</TE>
<TE>   If Kirch can keep his creditors at bay with the Springer sale and
negotiate a better Formula One future for the car makers as well as
himself, he might survive. Recently, he abandoned plans to merge his
broadcasting operations Kirch Media and the profitable ProSiebenSat.1
networks.</TE>
<TE>   "My gut feeling is that Kirch will survive as a very lean Kirch,
with Kirch Media, ProSiebenSat.1, the broadcasting libraries,"
Merrill Lynch's Tubeileh said. "These are the core businesses and
what he knows how to do best."</TE>

<HD>Home Sales Power Onward at Record Rate</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Surprising nationwide growth is attributed to
mild weather, improved consumer confidence and reviving economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nationwide sales of existing homes soared at a record pace in
January, defying projections and providing further evidence that the
economy may be pulling out of the recession, a report released Monday
found.</LD>
<LD>   The 16% increase from December was the largest ever, as sales
reached an annualized rate of 6million homes for the first time, said
the National Assn. of Realtors, which attributed the surprising
growth to a mild winter combined with the gradual improvement in
consumer confidence and the reviving economy.</LD>
<LD>   The report, which helped boost the stock market and shares of home
builders in particular, comes on the heels of a Census Bureau study
that showed the percentage of homeowners rose to record highs last
year in California and the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. homeownership rate, a barometer of financial and social
stability, has been climbing steadily since the 1990s, and last year
approached 68%. In California, homeownership jumped in counties as
varied as Ventura, San Diego, Fresno and Sacramento, although there
were no gains in the two urban centers, Los Angeles and San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the improving homeownership rate in recent years can
be attributed almost entirely to gains among an aging and more
prosperous population. And those long-term demographic trends are
continuing to push home sales.</TE>
<TE>   In releasing the strong January sales report, Martin Edwards Jr.,
president of the National Assn. of Realtors, said the housing market
was being spurred by the large number of immigrants and the growing
number of baby boomer children who are entering prime years of home
buying.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said they expected home sales numbers in February to
remain strong, boosted by the warm weather and mortgage rates, which
trended downward again early this year. But longer range, sales are
likely to weaken as pent-up demand dissipates and interest rates head
back up, said Celia Chen of the Dismal Scientist, a Web-based
economic research provider.</TE>
<TE>   In the January report, sales were strongest in the West.
California's sales of existing homes jumped 16% last month, thanks
largely to a flurry of activity in the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   The median home price nationwide advanced sharply last month,
climbing 10% to $151,100. In California, the price of a typical
detached home jumped 17% over the month to $285,860, said the
California Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of pent-up demand for housing in the wake of
Sept. 11, coupled with concerns about the direction of the California
economy," said Robert Bailey, president of the Los Angeles-based
group. "But home buyers who sat on the sidelines were back in the
game last month.</TE>
<TE>   "There's every indication that California is headed into a strong
home-selling season this spring," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If sales remain strong, that should help keep the homeownership
rate growing.</TE>
<TE>   In marking its second straight year of rising ownership,
California grew nearly four times faster than the nation last year.
The boost came from counties experiencing record levels of ownership,
including several in Southern California. Ventura jumped last year by
more than 8 percentage points to 74.4%, San Diego expanded by nearly
5 percentage points to 64%, and Orange County grew by 3.5 percentage
points to 65.8%.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the share of households that own homes rose about
1percentage point last year to 58.2%, according to the Census Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   But the gains were spread unevenly within the state and showed a
widening chasm between Los Angeles County and surrounding--and more
affluent--areas such as Orange and San Diego counties. In Los Angeles
County, homeownership rose nearly 1 percentage point to 50.1%, but
the gain was too small to be considered significant.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest report, Los Angeles is nearly 18 percentage points
below the average rate of homeowners in U.S. metropolitan areas, the
largest disparity that has ever existed for the county since the
Census Bureau began keeping records in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a gap between wages and housing prices in this region,
and it is widening despite the recession," said Peter Dreier, a
professor at Occidental College, who has backed an effort to create
in Los Angeles a housing trust fund. "That's a serious obstacle to
homeownership."</TE>
<TE>   "For homeownership to move up, we have to provide more
opportunities for people to buy homes without displacing renters,"
said Dowell Myers, a demographer at USC. "Given our land constraints
in Los Angeles County," he said, "we need to build condos or
townhomes."</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. sought to promote a "blond hair and blue
eyes" image in denying minorities the same pay and job opportunities
as whites, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found.</LD>
<LD>   The commission ruled that Polo, maker of Polo Sport and Club
Monaco clothing, discriminated against two ex-employees, including a
Filipino woman hired to develop an affirmative action program.
Although the ruling focuses on these two, the agency said other
minority employees also were victims of discrimination.</LD>
<LD>   "Testimony from several witnesses suggests that [Polo] managers
sought to maintain a 'blond hair and blue eyes' image of employees
who often advanced the 'image' over more qualified and experienced
minority employees," the EEOC said.</LD>
<TE>   The rulings came to light in a federal lawsuit filed by the two
former employees. The EEOC itself didn't sue. A Polo spokeswoman said
the company "denies all the allegations" and remains "committed to a
fair and diverse workplace."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the New York-based company rose 52 cents to close at
$28.22 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>A U.S. judge dismissed a class-action lawsuit against Tyco

the company reported acquisition costs.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Barbadoro, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Concord,

specifics and fell "well short of stating a viable securities fraud
claim."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Aladdin Gaming, operator of an Arabian-theme Las Vegas resort, asked
a federal bankruptcy judge for permission to liquidate the company's
assets through a court-supervised auction.</LD>
<LD>   Aladdin told Bankruptcy Judge Robert C. Jones in papers filed last
week that it "intends to liquidate in one transaction all property
and rights comprising the casino-hotel."</LD>
<LD>   Hurt by a failure to attract gamblers, Aladdin on Sept. 28 sought
bankruptcy protection from creditors just 13 months after the
$1-billion resort opened. The closely held company listed $698.1
million in assets and more than $593.4 million in debts in Chapter 11
papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Las Vegas.</LD>

services rendered. The suit, filed by attorney Patricia L. Glaser,
seeks payment of fees and unspecified damages.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute apparently centers on whether Saban, when he hired
Morgan Stanley to advise and assist in the sale of his 49.5% equity
interest in Fox Family, agreed to pay the firm if any sale went
through--or only if he exercised an option to sell his stake to Fox.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement issued in New York, Saban accused Morgan Stanley of
"overreaching," adding that the firm was involved in "a different
transaction." He said that Morgan Stanley performed no services
related to the sale to Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley disputes that point in its legal papers, saying it
"provided its financial advice ... to Saban" in connection with the
sale.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley was first retained by Saban in October 2000.
According to the suit, the firm engaged in extensive fee negotiations
with Saban. They finally agreed that Morgan Stanley would receive a
percentage scaled on the value of the final sale as an "incentive" to
obtain the highest price for Saban.</TE>
<TE>   Saban, who in 1995 helped launch Fox Family in a joint venture
with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., held a 49.5% equity interest in the
company. Saban, Murdoch and Disney's Michael Eisner reached a
"handshake agreement" in July to sell the company to Disney. A month
later, according to the suit, Saban's representatives informed Morgan
Stanley's managing director that Saban felt "personally" obligated to
pay a fee to another advisor, Ed Aboodi and Alpine Capital, in
connection with the deal. Morgan Stanley was asked to split its fee,
which it refused to do.</TE>
<TE>   The final deal went through in October, with a purchase price of
$5.2 billion--including $2.9 billion in cash and assumption of $2.3
million in debt. Saban "and his affiliates" received about $1.4
billion, court papers say.</TE>

<HD>SAG Deal Becomes Campaign Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Screen Actors Guild presidential candidate Valerie Harper on Monday
criticized a tentative deal governing relations between actors and
talent agents, saying she is confident members will reject the accord
because of potential conflicts of interest.</LD>
<LD>   The salvo, triggered hours after the deal was unveiled, shows how
divisive virtually every decision at the union is these days amid a
controversial new election in which Harper is facing off again with
actress Melissa Gilbert, who served on the committee that negotiated
the pact with agents.</LD>
<LD>   Gilbert defeated Harper last fall, but the results were scrapped
after a SAG committee concluded there were election irregularities.</LD>
<TE>   The most controversial part of the new "master franchise"
agreement would allow limited investments by advertising agencies and
advertisers in talent agencies. Agents have pushed for a relaxing of
the rules so they can attract capital, but Harper and others say
joining agents with advertisers blurs the line between agent and
employer.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an absolute lie that agents won't become our employers,"
Harper said.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating a backlash, SAG on Monday put forth three negotiating
committee members who ran on Harper's ticket in the fall--Chairman
Tom LaGrua, actor Esai Morales and actress Tess Harper--to defend the
deal and the work of the committee. Morales said he initially was
skeptical of doing any deal with agents, but believes the agreement
contains safeguards for actors.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, major advertising agencies or advertisers
would be allowed to start with a 10% investment, and would be allowed
to increase to the maximum of 20% only with approval of a joint
committee of actors and agents. Agencies would be required to notify
actors of any investments, and allow actors to leave if they don't
like the arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, SAG would be allowed to bolster its depleted health
plan by getting as a fee 1.5% of any investment that companies made
in agencies.</TE>
<TE>   SAG also gets a cut of new commissions that agents would get under
the deal, including commissions for TV reruns as well as DVD and
video deals they negotiate.</TE>

<HD>Williams- Sonoma Boosts '01 Guidance</HD>
<DH>Retail: The company credits cost cutting and strong
merchandise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Williams-Sonoma Inc. on Monday raised its earnings estimate for
fiscal 2001 because of cost controls and merchandise that appealed to
customers eager to spend money on their living space.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco company, which runs the Williams-Sonoma, Pottery
Barn and Hold Everything chains, also said profit for fiscal 2002
would hit the upper end of Wall Street's expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Williams-Sonoma and home-oriented retailers such as Pier 1 Imports
Inc. and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond have benefited from people spending more
time at home since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, and
analysts see that momentum continuing this year.</LD>
<TE>   Williams-Sonoma now expects earnings of $1.31 to $1.32 a share for
the 12 months ended in January, up from both its previous forecast of
$1.25 to $1.28 and prior-year profit of 99 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock rose $1.06, or 2.4%, to $45.15 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The shares have more than doubled from a low of
$21.37 in the aftermath of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   For fiscal 2002, Williams-Sonoma said it expected earnings of
$1.52 to $1.56 a share. Analysts on average expected $1.51, with a
range of $1.46 to $1.57.</TE>
<TE>   Williams-Sonoma said it would close 16 stores this year and open
66 new ones, including 23 Williams-Sonoma and 25 Pottery Barn Kids
locations.</TE>

<HD>Recycled Electronics Pose a Health Hazard in Asia</HD>
<DH>Technology:  Laborers scavenging for metals are exposed to
toxic materials, report says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High-tech garbage dropped off at U.S. recycling centers--including
ancient PCs, cell phones and MP3 players--is causing an environmental
and health crisis in Asia, according to a report released Monday by
several environmental organizations.</LD>
<LD>   The report, "Exporting Harm: The High-Tech Trashing of Asia,"
found that up to 80% of all electronics waste collected for recycling
in America is purchased by brokers, which export the equipment to
China, India, Pakistan and other developing countries. Once there,
thousands of laborers--including children--burn, smash and tear apart
electronic waste to scavenge for precious metals.</LD>
<LD>   In the process, they have unwittingly exposed themselves and their
surroundings to toxic hazards, including lead poisoning, chemical
blindness, pulmonary edema and cancer, according to the report.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the dirty little secret of the 'clean' high-tech industry,"
said Jim Puckett, coordinator of Seattle-based Basel Action Network,
one of the environmental groups that toured China in December and
worked on the report. "Most people have no idea how common this is."</TE>
<TE>   Such equipment comes from all over the U.S. Those discarding their
old electronics include students buying a new digital camera,
families upgrading their phones and even the Los Angeles Unified
School District overhauling its classroom computers.</TE>
<TE>   In Guiyu, China, villagers make ends meet by burning electronic
wires to draw out traces of copper. The report details how the
workers, including scores of children, doused circuit boards in acid
baths to remove precious metals from the discarded parts.</TE>
<TE>   Photographs taken by the report's authors show the villagers
working on machines with identifying tags from the LAUSD and the city
of Los Angeles. The city's Bureau of Sanitation regularly holds
electronic and computer recycling events.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm incredibly surprised. It never even crossed our minds," said
Jim Konantz, LAUSD assistant superintendent for instructional
technology. "We don't know what happens to the machines after they
leave us."</TE>
<TE>   The school district regularly auctions off its older tech gear to
the public, Konantz said.</TE>
<TE>   Often, computer parts wholesalers such as Port Chain Industries of
Riverside buy the equipment at auction and resell it to recycling
brokers in bulk. The firm has been the biggest buyer in the last two
school district auctions.</TE>
<TE>   "People buy from us and ship overseas," said Lily Chen, a Port
Chain employee.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where they go," Chen said. "They go away."</TE>
<TE>   The demand for ever smarter and more powerful technology has cut
the life span of a consumer electronic device from five years to 18
months, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 study conducted by Stanford Resources Inc. for the National
Safety Council projected that in 2001, more than 41 million personal
computers would become obsolete in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts estimate that in California more than 6,000 computers
become obsolete every day.</TE>
<TE>   Each device is filled with potential hazards, the study's
researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   One of the main dangers comes from cathode ray tubes, the
technical name for the glowing screens used in computer monitors and
televisions.</TE>
<TE>   The average 14-inch monitor uses a tube that contains an estimated
5 to 8 pounds of lead. The lead can seep into the ground water in
landfills or, if the tube is crushed and burned, float into the air.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, cadmium is found in semiconductor chips, chromium in
a PC's steel exterior and brominated flame retardants in the circuit
boards. All the materials are considered toxic.</TE>
<TE>   Given these hazards, the Environmental Protection Agency bans
businesses from discarding computers in the trash.</TE>
<TE>   In California, it is against the law to dump computer monitors
into landfills.</TE>
<TE>   Broken monitors are considered hazardous waste, according to the
state Department of Toxic Substances Control.</TE>
<TE>   Some PC makers, such as IBM Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., have
launched recycling programs that charge consumers $30 or more for the
service.</TE>

<HD>Air Force Seeking Additional C-17s</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: New orders could be worth $15 billion and keep
Boeing's Long Beach line open until 2011.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY CAPACCIO</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Air Force says it needs 102 more C-17 transport planes than those
already ordered from Boeing Co. so it can meet combat and
humanitarian-mission needs.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Department initially agreed to buy 120 C-17s. In
December it said it would ask Congress to increase that by 60 planes
in a contract valued at as much as $10 billion, which would keep
Boeing's Long Beach production line operating through 2007. Gen. John
Handy, commander of the U.S. Transportation Command, said that an
additional 42 planes will be needed, giving the Air Force a fleet of
222 planes.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. military views Asia as a more likely military theater for
the U.S. than Europe, Handy said, increasing the need for long-range
transport aircraft such as the C-17. The large planes can carry heavy
equipment directly from the U.S. and land on primitive airfields. The
operation in Afghanistan has reinforced that notion, Handy said.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm fairly convinced, looking at Afghanistan, that we have a
tremendous challenge on the air side--every single ounce of what has
gone into Afghanistan has gone in by air," Handy said in an interview
during the Air Force Assn.'s annual tactical warfare symposium in
Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Boeing is aware of Handy's estimate and is in talks
with the Air Force, said Daniel Page, Boeing's director of C-17
market development.</TE>
<TE>   A contract for 102 additional transports instead of 60 could be
valued at as much as $15 billion and extend production at the Long
Beach assembly line to 2011, Page said. Boeing has said it may close
the C-17 production line by 2004 unless more planes were ordered
beyond the 120 in the pipeline. About 8,000 people are employed on
the C-17 program.</TE>
<TE>   The planes included in the contract for 60 C-17s were offered at
$152 million each in 1999 dollars, compared with the current average
of $198 million, Page said.</TE>
<TE>   The C-17 has shown in Afghanistan its ability to land on a short,
unimproved runway. C-17s flew 43 missions into Camp Rhino, the Marine
Corps base southeast of Kandahar, delivering 1,450 tons of heavy
equipment, including graders, earthmovers and bulldozers, as well as
419 passengers. Camp Rhino "was a perfect example" of what a C-17 can
do that other large Air Force transports can't, Handy said.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing shares rose 18 cents to close at $44.94 on the New York
Stock Exchange. They have fallen 27% in the last year.</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P Recants Move on Calpine Credit Rating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Standard &amp; Poor's retracted an announcement that it may reduce San
Jose-based Calpine Corp.'s credit rating half an hour after its
release Monday, saying the statement was based on inaccurate
information.</LD>
<LD>   Calpine's stock and debt rallied after S&amp;P recanted its statement
that the power generator planned to secure a new line of credit with
company assets, which would have made bondholders less secure in the
event of a bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   But later Monday, after the S&amp;P retraction, Calpine said it was in
fact considering a "new, expanded and secured credit facility" to
improve its cash position. Calpine had said previously that a
$1-billion credit line it's arranging would be unsecured.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll have more details when we make our announcement," said
spokeswoman Katherine Potter. She declined to say how big the new
credit line would be or when an announcement may be made.</TE>
<TE>   The first S&amp;P announcement immediately sent Calpine stock tumbling
to $6.15 from $6.56 in New York Stock Exchange trading. After the
retraction the shares rebounded to close at $6.83, down 28 cents for
the day.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P spokeswoman Rebecca Hill said the debt rating firm's statement
was "a publishing error." S&amp;P said Calpine's rating remained at
BB-plus.</TE>

<HD>Culver City to Get Industrial Complex</HD>
<DH>Westway Development will start construction on a
two-building 'flex space' project near Jefferson and Overland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB HOWARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Landlords who rushed to convert their Culver City industrial
buildings to offices during the dot-com boom apparently shrank the
industrial market enough to create an opportunity for new
construction.</LD>
<LD>   Westway Development expects to break ground this summer on its
two-building, 243,000-square-foot project on a 12-acre site near
Jefferson Boulevard and Overland Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The buildings will be what Westway managing member Mark Webber
described as "flex" space, which can be used for warehouses, light
manufacturing, research and development or other industrial purposes.</LD>
<TE>   Webber's project will be among the few industrial buildings
constructed in recent years in Culver City, which has one of Southern
California's largest concentrations of former industrial properties.
Beginning in the mid-1990s, nearly 2.6 million square feet of
industrial space in the Marina del Rey-Culver City market was
converted to offices, according to a study by Grubb &amp; Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   Owners converted their buildings to accommodate the voracious
demand from dot-com companies, entertainment firms, architects,
advertising agencies and other tenants who wanted "creative office
space" with an industrial look rather than traditional offices, said
Grubb &amp; Ellis broker Joseph Gabbaian.</TE>
<TE>   Office space commanded higher rents--up to $2.25 per square foot
per month, compared with the 40 to 50 cents per square foot per month
the owners were getting for industrial uses. But the widespread
conversion left the Westside with a shortage of industrial space,
said Gabbaian, who noted that more than 27% of the creative office
space in the Marina-Culver City market is now vacant as a result of
the dot-com crash and the economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas-based Westway has owned industrial property in Culver
City for about 20 years, according to Webber, who expects his project
to be completed early next year. He and his attorney, Tony Ciasulli,
worked for more than three years to assemble the 12 acres, which
Culver City's community development director, Marsha Rood, described
as "one of the few and one of the largest parcels of land available
for development in the city."</TE>
<TE>   Besides settling with nine property owners, Ciasulli said, Westway
had to obtain agreements from 10 owners of mineral rights and three
operators of oil wells on the land. One working well will remain on
the property, but two others were abandoned and capped, a process
that requires governmental approval and inspections, which further
complicated the deal.</TE>

<HD>Cushman, Premas Join to Tap Chinese Market</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc., the second-largest U.S. real estate
company, formed a joint venture with Premas International Ltd. to
provide real estate brokerage and other services to companies
expanding in China.</LD>
<LD>   The venture will offer consulting, brokerage and asset management
to international firms doing business in China and Chinese firms
looking to expand abroad, Cushman spokesman Terry Spillane said. The
operation will have offices in Shanghai and Beijing and will operate
under the name Cushman &amp; Wakefield Premas.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. firms are expanding internationally as the real estate
services industry consolidates worldwide. In 1998, Cushman acquired
London-based Healy &amp; Baker for $112 million to gain offices in 14
European and Middle Eastern countries. Insignia/ESG Holdings Inc.,
Los Angeles-based CB Richard Ellis Services Inc., which is the
biggest U.S. real estate company, and Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. have
expanded overseas in recent years.</LD>
<TE>   The venture with Premas will let Cushman expand its asset
management services in a country where the gross domestic product is
growing at an 8% annual rate, said John Coppedge, Cushman's executive
vice president of international operations. "They have 175 people in
China. We couldn't replicate that in two years."</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Coppedge said, Cushman has served primarily as a tenant
representative in China.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Seah, chief executive of Premas, will serve as the
venture's chairman, and Michael Thompson, group chief executive of
Cushman &amp; Wakefield Asia Pacific, will be its managing director.</TE>
<TE>   Premas is a subsidiary of CapitalLand Ltd., a Singapore-based
property management company. Cushman &amp; Wakefield is a unit of
Mitsubishi Estate Co. of Tokyo, a real estate investment firm. The
venture won't start to operate until Chinese authorities approve it.</TE>

<HD>General Motors Boosts Profit Forecasts for Quarter, Year</HD>
<DH>Autos: U.S. sales are higher than expected; increased
production is planned--5.1 million cars and trucks in 2002.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp., the only U.S. auto maker to gain market share
last year, boosted profit and production estimates for the quarter
and full year, citing better-than-expected sales in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   First-quarter profit, excluding the Hughes division and some
expenses, will be $1.20 a share, up from a forecast of $1, the
world's largest auto maker said. The full-year forecast was raised to
$3.50 from $3.</LD>
<LD>   The company also will sell as much as $3 billion in convertible
debt securities as part of an effort to strengthen its balance sheet,
Chief Financial Officer John Devine said.</LD>
<TE>   General Motors raised its forecast for industrywide sales this
year by about 1 million vehicles to 16 million, helping lift U.S.
stocks, including rivals Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler. Chief
Executive G. Richard Wagoner's introduction of no-interest loans
spurred sales in 2001, and the falloff when the offers expired last
month wasn't as steep as auto makers predicted.</TE>
<TE>   GM shares rose $2.37 to $55.48 and helped push the Dow Jones
industrial average past 10,000. Ford rose 65 cents to $15.23 and
DaimlerChrysler jumped $1.85 to $39.73. All three trade on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Devine plans to boost the auto maker's balance sheet by $10
billion this year through the convertibles offering, about $4.2
billion in cash from the sale of Hughes Electronics Corp. to Echostar
Communications Corp. and taking a dividend of as much as half the
profit of unit General Motors Acceptance Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The profit forecasts exclude costs for reorganizing the European
business and possible costs of meeting new European laws requiring
auto makers to help dispose of used vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were expecting GM to earn 87 cents a share for the
quarter, including a loss of 10 cents to 15 cents attributable to
Hughes, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   GM earned 50 cents a share in first-quarter 2001, excluding some
costs and including a loss of 9 cents from Hughes. For the year,
earnings were $3.23, excluding some expenses and including a 41-cent
Hughes loss.</TE>
<TE>   The company estimated the gain from the Hughes sale will be $14.4
billion, based on the unit's value and Echostar's closing price as of
Dec. 31. The deal still needs regulatory approval.</TE>
<TE>   Devine said GM expects to build 5.1 million cars and trucks this
year, 100,000 more than previously planned. GM raised first-quarter
production by 20,000 vehicles to 1.34 million, up 10% from a year
earlier. For the second quarter, it expects to build 1.425 million
vehicles, up 4%.</TE>
<TE>   The company's revised 2002 industrywide sales forecast of 16
million is still below the 17.2 million cars and trucks sold last
year. Auto makers expected the decline because high fourth-quarter
demand generated by no-interest loans may have taken sales that
normally would have come this year. The decline in January was less
than forecast.</TE>
<TE>   GM also said it has $136.2 billion in assets in special purpose
entities, providing additional disclosure after Enron Corp. revealed
it had partnerships tied to company executives and sought bankruptcy
protection.</TE>
<TE>   The auto maker said it uses the entities in a manner "consistent
with conventional practices" and that no officers, directors or
employees hold equity interest in the partnerships. GM said it uses
the entities in financing and insurance operations to bundle and sell
mortgages and auto loans.</TE>
<TE>   In other news, General Motors and union workers held rallies at
plants in three Midwestern states, warning that the U.S. auto
industry would lose more than 100,000 American jobs if a proposal to
raise fuel economy standards were adopted.</TE>
<TE>   The rallies in Pontiac, Mich., Toledo, Ohio, and Janesville, Wis.,
are the latest effort by GM to counter a proposal by Sens. Ernest F.
Hollings (D-S.C.) and John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) to raise the average
fuel economy of new cars and trucks to 35 miles a gallon by 2013.
Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and GM officials said the Corporate Average
Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards unfairly discriminate against
American auto makers.</TE>

<HD>Dow Tops 10,000 as Stocks Rise on Positive Home Sales Data,
Forecasts</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Accounting worries ease as good corporate news
abounds and reports suggest an economy in recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks climbed for a second straight session Monday, with the Dow
Jones industrial average closing back above the key 10,000 level as
red-hot home sales data yanked attention away from accounting
scandals.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street was buoyed by a wide range of upbeat corporate
forecasts from the likes of wireless technology firm Qualcomm, home
products retailer Williams-Sonoma and auto maker General Motors.</LD>
<LD>   "There are positives out there that you just haven't seen
recently," said Barry Berman, head of equity trading for Robert W.
Baird &amp; Co. "The existing home sales data bode well for other
economic reports coming out later this week."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow industrials jumped 177.56 points, or 1.8%, to
10,145.71--its highest level since the second week of January.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 19.59 points, or 1.8%, to
1,109.43, its largest daily percentage gain since early December. The
Nasdaq composite index surged 45.34 points, or 2.6%, to 1,769.88, its
biggest one-day percentage gain since Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by almost 5 to 4 on Nasdaq and by about 3 to 2
on the New York Stock Exchange in active trading.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's advance pushed the Dow into positive territory for the
year--up 1.2% year-to-date. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq remain mired in
the red, however, down 3.4% and 9.3% for the year, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   As the market's concern about corporate accounting subsides, "the
focus will be on economic data, and the data continue to suggest we
are in recovery and the recession is behind us," said Peter Cardillo,
chief strategist at Global Partners Securities Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The latest numbers showed sales of U.S. existing homes soared by a
record 16.2% in January to an annual pace of 6 million units, due to
mild weather and rebounding consumer confidence. Analysts polled by
Reuters had predicted an annual pace of 5.3 million units.</TE>
<TE>   "The housing market continues to stay strong despite the weak jobs
market, and that's really good news," Cardillo said.</TE>
<TE>   The report sparked a rally in home builders' stocks. KB Home
gained $1.78 to $41.84, D.R. Horton rose $1.03 to $37.34 and Centex
rose $2.13 to $55.43. The Bloomberg index of home builders' stocks
gained 2.1%.</TE>
<TE>   GM climbed $2.37 to $55.48 after the auto maker raised its
estimates for first-quarter and full-year earnings and production
schedules, citing better-than-expected sales in the United States. GM
also said there were signs the U.S. economy is recovering from
recession.</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm rose $3.21 to $35.91. The wireless-technology vendor
reported better-than-expected demand for its cell phone chips, easing
jitters about the company and the industry's health. And retailer
Williams-Sonoma, up $1.06 at $45.15, boosted its fiscal 2001 earnings
outlook, citing cost controls and products that appealed to consumers
eager to spend money on their living space.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's rally came on the heels of a strong day on European
bourses. In Germany, stocks gained 2.5%, while shares in Britain
advanced 1% and the market in France rose 1.4%.</TE>
<TE>   In other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * TRW rose a penny to $50.31 in its second day of trading after
Northrop Grumman offered to buy it for $47 a share in stock. TRW
shares rose 26% on Friday, the day the bid was announced. Northrop
Grumman's stock slid $1.51 to $108.44 Monday.</TE>
<TE>   * Home improvement retailer Lowe's rose $1.44 to $47.49 after
reporting a jump in quarterly profit and saying fiscal 2002 earnings
would top current estimates. Rival Home Depot, a Dow stock, added
$1.07 to $52.07.</TE>
<TE>   * Caterpillar surged $3.38 to $56.06. The tractor maker's
first-quarter earnings are expected to be better than expected, the
company told Barron's.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco International rose $2 to $29.50 after the company said a
court dismissed shareholder claims that Tyco inflated profits through
accounting maneuvers.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Depositions Are Released</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge grants access to transcripts of interviews
with execs that will offer a preview of antitrust hearings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The federal judge overseeing the Microsoft Corp. antitrust case
agreed Monday to make public the transcripts and videotapes of
depositions taken recently from Microsoft Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer and several other major figures in the case.</LD>
<LD>   The transcripts and tapes may provide a preview of the testimony
at hearings scheduled to begin March 11 on sanctions that could be
imposed on Microsoft for antitrust violations, according to Howard
University law professor Andrew Gavil.</LD>
<LD>   "To the extent these witnesses reappear at trial, you'll have a
little bit more time to anticipate what they say," Gavil said.</LD>
<TE>   The judge, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of U.S. District Court, granted
requests from eight newspapers including Los Angeles Times and news
services for access to transcripts of interviews with Ballmer;
Microsoft executive James Allchin; former Netscape Communications
Corp. Chairman James Barksdale; and Liberate Technologies Inc.
Chairman Mitchell Kertzman.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly, who denied sweeping access to all the interviews
in the case, also granted access to the transcripts of any interviews
that may be given by Sun Microsystems Inc. Chairman Scott McNealy.
But a Microsoft spokesman said the company has no plans to interview
McNealy.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft reached a settlement in November with the Justice
Department and nine of the states originally in the case.</TE>
<TE>   But nine other states' attorneys general are seeking stronger
sanctions against Microsoft to prevent future violations of antitrust
law and have named witnesses for hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Microsoft, which is trying to counter criticism from
rivals that it bullies other companies, said Linda Stone resigned two
years after being promoted to vice president in charge of changing
the biggest software maker's corporate culture.</TE>
<TE>   Stone, 47, plans to leave on March 15 to write a book on the way
people interact with technology, company spokeswoman Nicole Miller
said.</TE>
<TE>   Stone reported to Ballmer, who directed her in May 2000 to meet
with customers, partners and rivals to see how Microsoft could
improve relations with them.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's vice president for corporate and industry initiatives
was appointed after companies, including Apple Computer Inc. and
America Online Inc.--now AOL Time Warner Inc.--testified at the
company's antitrust trial that it had engaged in predatory conduct.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qualcomm Inc. said its fiscal second-quarter profit will meet its
forecast because of increased demand for newer semiconductors used in
wireless devices. The San Diego-based chip designer said that profit
excluding certain costs will be 20 cents a share in the period ending
March 31. Chief Executive Irwin Jacobs boosted by 14% his forecast
for shipments of newer phone chips that deliver faster wireless
Internet access, a bright sign for an industry where wireless
subscriber growth has stalled. Qualcomm shares gained 9.8%, or $3.21,
to $35.91 on Nasdaq.</LD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. is perfecting a production process that it says will double
semiconductor speeds in fiber-optic networks within a year. The
largest computer maker said in June that the method will boost speeds
by shrinking microscopic transistors made with the nonmetallic
element germanium and silicon. IBM at the time forecast production of
such chips by mid-2003 yet now says they may be ready for customers
by early 2003. IBM has used the transistors to build a functioning
chip circuit.</LD>
<LD>   The new chips are 30% faster and less costly than those made from
such substances as indium phosphide and gallium arsenide.</LD>
<LD>   IBM also said it won a $4 billion, seven-year contract to supply
American Express Co. with computer processing power and related
services on demand, the way a utility sells electricity.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Computer Horizons Corp. Chairman John J. Cassese agreed to pay
$300,000 to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that he
traded on inside information about a merger between two other
companies. The SEC alleged that Cassese, the top official at the
information technology services company, bought Data Processing
Resources Corp. shares after learning about a planned tender offer
for its stock from Compuware Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Cassese sold all 15,000 shares of Data Processing after
Compuware's merger offer was announced in June 1999, pocketing
$150,937 in profit, the SEC said. "I'm very well paid, and it looks
stupid," said Cassese, 57, who has been chairman since 1983. He
neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing and agreed to settle the SEC
complaint by paying a $150,937 fine and surrendering $150,937 in
profit.</LD>

<HD>New Project Planned for Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Legacy Partners' proposed $282-million mixed-use
development features a hotel, 250 residential units and retail space.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A panel reviewing alternatives for development near the Hollywood and
Vine Metro Red Line station has given a preliminary OK to a mixed-use
project featuring a W Hotel and about 250 residential units.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed $282-million project is the latest in a string of
redevelopment ventures collectively pumping more than $1 billion of
private-sector capital into Hollywood property improvements. But the
recommendation also comes at a time when the slumping economy and
tepid climate for tourism are hindering the district's recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The staff panel from the Community Redevelopment Agency and
Metropolitan Transportation Authority recommended last week that the
agencies select a proposal by Foster City, Calif.-based Legacy
Partners, which is in negotiations with the MTA to build a housing
and retail complex at the North Hollywood subway station. Legacy's
Hollywood development team includes Dallas-based Gatehouse Capital
Corp., which would develop the 300-room hotel.</LD>
<TE>   The panel's report said the Legacy plan is the only proposal among
four finalists that includes a hotel in its initial phase and
provides a firm commitment from a hotel operator--the W chain's
parent Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide. The proposal also
includes 200 apartments, 46 condominiums, 30,000 square feet of
ground-level retail space, 732 underground parking spaces and a
transit plaza linking the subway to surface transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Legacy's proposal involves several adjacent sites owned by other
parties, so it is contingent on the developer's ability to reach
agreements with those owners. The developer group also might seek CRA
assistance to obtain those properties, or revise the plan to include
just the MTA's 2.8 acres near the southeast corner of Hollywood
Boulevard and Vine Street.</TE>
<TE>   MTA and CRA staffers now will prepare an exclusive negotiating
agreement through which the two agencies and the developers will try
to hammer out a final development contract. Construction probably
wouldn't begin for two years, said Dennis Cavallari, senior vice
president with Legacy Partners' residential group in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the developers and their designers will work with the
agencies and community members to fine-tune the architecture for the
high-profile project. Although the recession and dot-com collapse
have left Hollywood with an over-supply of office space, developers
continue to pursue retail and residential projects.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Hollywood marketplace is fabulous," Cavallari said.
"We're excited about the opportunity to become a part of the
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   The W may become an "anchor" for the heart of Hollywood, much like
the Hollywood &amp; Highland project's new 637-room Marriott Renaissance
is doing for Hollywood's western flank, said Rob Langer of Meringoff
Equities, Hollywood's biggest office landlord. Meringoff plans to
build a 50,000-square-foot high-end retail development at Hollywood
and Vine's northeast corner.</TE>
<TE>   Just south on Vine at Sunset Boulevard, a group led by Century
City's Bond Capital Ltd. has cleared a site for a planned $200-
million development stacking 300 loft-style apartments atop a
90,000-square-foot shopping center anchored by Borders Books and Bed
Bath &amp; Beyond. Construction is set to begin in May.</TE>

<HD>Williams Communications Group May File Bankruptcy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TULSA, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Williams Communications Group Inc. said Monday that it may seek
bankruptcy protection, a move that could leave its former parent
company on the hook for $2.6 billion of the telephone-and-data
network operator's costs.</LD>
<LD>   The company, facing an estimated $500 million in interest payments
this year, said its lenders extended a deadline to submit a
debt-reduction plan. Williams Cos., a natural gas pipeline owner that
spun off the network operator in April, has guaranteed a portion of
the former unit's debt.</LD>
<LD>   Williams Communications said it is considering a plan that may
wipe out shareholder equity, lower costs by 25% and include job cuts.
The company racked up $5.2billion in debt building a fiber-optic
network in the 1990s amid an expansion frenzy by rivals such as
Global Crossing Ltd. and PSINet Inc., both of which filed for Chapter
11 as demand fell short.</LD>
<TE>   "In this kind of environment where there is no equity value, and
capital markets are closed to the company, [bankruptcy] becomes the
most viable option," said Eric Misenheimer, who manages $400million
of bonds at Northern Trust Corp. He doesn't hold Williams
Communications debt.</TE>
<TE>   Williams Communications bonds fell 7 to 15 cents on the dollar,
traders said.</TE>
<TE>   A bankruptcy filing may force Williams Cos. to pay $1.4 billion in
Williams Communications debt, $750 million for fiber-optic leases and
$250 million for  other expenses, Chief Executive Steve Malcolm said
last month.</TE>
<TE>   Several investor lawsuits accuse Williams Cos. of misleading
shareholders about its liability for the communications company
before the spinoff. Williams Cos. created a tracking stock for the
unit in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Williams Cos. wanted to keep an attractive asset on the books by
creating a stock and having some contingent liabilities," said Jon
Goebel, a fund manager at SouthTrust Securities Inc., which owns
Williams Cos. shares. "They didn't anticipate how quick the decline
would be, and in hindsight it's been a disaster for them."</TE>
<TE>   Goebel's firm sold its Williams Communications shares  last year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Williams Communications fell 29 cents to 22 cents. The
stock has plunged from a high of $61.81 in March 2000. Williams Cos.
fell $1.46 to $14.84. The stock is down 42% this year. Both
Tulsa-based  firms trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>   The securities industry has come under heavy fire from regulators,
politicians and investors over the last year to end conflicts of
interest that cast doubt on the honesty of analysts' research.
Critics also have called for analysts to be clearer in their reports
instead of using murky language to obscure negative feelings about
some stocks.</LD>
<LD>   Morgan Stanley, the second-largest U.S. brokerage, said it will
begin using three stock ratings--overweight, equal-weight and
underweight--as of March 18.</LD>
<TE>   The brokerage's current ratings are strong buy, outperform,
neutral and underperform.</TE>
<TE>   Under Morgan's new system, an overweight rating means the analyst
believes the stock will produce a greater total return (appreciation
plus any dividend income) than the average return expected of others
covered in its industry over the next 12 to 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   An equal-weight rating indicates the stock's performance is
expected to be in line with the average return of others in the
analysts' coverage, while underweight means the stock is expected to
perform worse than the other companies covered in its industry.</TE>
<TE>   A stock's rating will factor in the perceived risk in the shares
relative to others in its sector, Morgan said.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Shea, head of Morgan Stanley's global research in New York,
said the firm opted against simple buy, sell or hold ratings because
"we think the jargon of 'buy' and 'sell' is misleading. What is a buy
for a 25-year-old clearly might not be a buy for a 65-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   "We are also committing to using the full ratings spectrum," Shea
said, meaning investors can expect to see more negative stock
opinions from Morgan analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The brokerage currently gives its lowest rating, underperform, to
0.8% of the 877 stocks it covers, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street has been lambasted for maintaining overly cheery views
of stocks even as the market plunged over the last two years. Critics
say analysts have been pressured into writing favorably about
companies simply to guarantee that their firms receive lucrative
investment-banking business from the subject companies.</TE>
<TE>   Prudential Securities made a similar move to simplify stock
ratings last year, changing its system to three opinions--buy, sell
or hold.</TE>

<HD>CalSTRS Seeks Lead in Homestore.com Suits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California State Teachers' Retirement System filed a motion
Monday to be named lead plaintiff in nearly 20 consolidated lawsuits
against Homestore.com Inc. and several former executives.</LD>
<LD>   The move is another example of pension funds seeking to spearhead
efforts to recover damages from companies alleged to have used phony
accounting to attract investors. Major pension funds also are
aggressively seeking damages from Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   CalSTRS, the nation's third-largest public pension fund, said it
lost an estimated $9 million on more than 431,000 Homestore shares
from May 4, 2000, to Dec. 21, 2001, the time period cited in the
lawsuits. The stock collapsed after the online home-listings company
warned that its results would fall short of expectations.</LD>
<TE>   The suits claim that Westlake Village-based Homestore tried to
prop up its stock for much of last year by issuing a false picture of
company finances, and that executives sold at least $28 million of
personal stock while the price was high. The suits also allege
accounting irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore has warned in recent weeks that it would be restating
financial results for 2000 and 2001. Company founder Stuart H. Wolff
resigned Jan. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Ehnes, chief executive of CalSTRS, said he believes
Homestore's chances of survival--and the fund's chances of recovering
its losses--are slim. "At this point it's unlikely [the fund] will
regain its original investment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he said, the fund wants to send a message,
demonstrating that "there are those who are ready to step up to
ensure fair dealings" in financial markets. The fund's motion will be
heard March 25 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Homestore's stock is facing delisting by Nasdaq because
the firm's plans to restate results for 2000 and 2001 have caused it
to miss filing timely financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   Trading in Homestore shares resumed Friday after being halted Feb.
13 while Nasdaq sought more information. On Monday the stock fell 7
cents to 78 cents.</TE>
<TE>   A Homestore spokesman said the company will formally request a
hearing before a Nasdaq panel this week.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said it expects to file revised financial statements
before Nasdaq is required to take further action to delist the stock.</TE>

<HD>Flustered Winner Claims Big Prize</HD>
<DH>Lottery: Montebello woman hid her single QuickPick ticket
in a prayer book all week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a week of nervousness, the final winner in last week's
$193-million state lottery on Monday took her single QuickPick ticket
out of the prayer book where it had been hidden and claimed her
prize.</LD>
<LD>   Welma Naguit, a single mother from Montebello who had asked
friends to buy a $1 lottery ticket for her, said she was too afraid
to leave her house after learning she was one of three winners who
had split the jackpot.</LD>
<LD>   Lottery officials convinced her Monday to appear--albeit
briefly--at a 7-Eleven convenience store in Orange where they were
presenting a check to the shop owner who sold one of the winning
tickets to a Tustin Ranch couple.</LD>
<TE>   "I cannot sleep," said Naguit, who hid in a restroom of the
convenience store after her brief appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Naguit said she plans to buy a house, help relatives and donate a
portion of her winnings to the World Trade Center relief effort.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm in the Philippines, we have a dream," said Naguit, a
resident alien who came to the United States a year ago. "When I came
in the United States, I wanted to buy a house--and just like
that...."</TE>
<TE>   Naguit was returning from the Philippines when she heard about the
size of the lottery jackpot. She had asked friends to buy a $1 ticket
for her at a 7-Eleven near her home.</TE>
<TE>   She credited her religious faith for her fortunes and said she hid
the winning ticket in a prayer book as she wrestled with nerves and
insomnia.</TE>
<TE>   "She asked me, 'What were the other winners like?'" said Joan
Wilson, chief executive officer of the California Lottery Commission.
"It just shows that winners come from all walks of life. I don't
think she believes she's won yet."</TE>
<TE>   Naguit, who elected to take her winnings in a single payout, will
get $33 million before taxes. Tustin residents Paul Briscoe, 49, and
his wife Rose, 45, and a Half Moon Bay man, Andy Kampe, are the other
winners.</TE>
<TE>   Naguit, described as being in her 40s, worked as a launderer and
has a son, lottery officials said. They said she is going through a
divorce.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very, very nervous having won this amount of money," said
Margie Bennett, owner of the Montebello 7-Eleven where Naguit's
ticket was purchased. Bennett, who will get roughly $321,000 for
selling the ticket, said Naguit is a regular customer.</TE>
<TE>   State lottery officials arranged to meet Naguit near her home and
then drove her to the Orange convenience store while relatives
followed.</TE>
<TE>   "Her hands were sweaty wet," said Wilson, who accompanied Naguit.
"I've never felt anything like that before."</TE>
<TE>   The jackpot was the largest single-state prize ever won.</TE>

<HD>Opening of New High School Is Delayed by Mold</HD>
<DH>Education: L.A. Unified says the removal of the possible
health hazard from the Sun Valley campus will put off its debut until
July 2003.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The opening of a sorely needed high school in a converted Department
of Water and Power office building in Sun Valley will be delayed by
more than a year as workers remove mold that could pose health
hazards, school officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The top two floors of the four-story Anthony Office Building were
scheduled to open in September to help relieve overcrowding at
Francis Polytechnic High School across the street on Arleta Avenue.
But with the discovery of mold, the opening has been delayed until
July 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Although a link has not been scientifically proven, mold has been
blamed for allergies, migraines and respiratory problems. It has
plagued school districts nationwide and is considered a serious
problem, school officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The mold discovered on stairway walls in the DWP building is
believed to be caused by water that leaked from a glass atrium.
Exponent Consultants, the firm hired by the DWP two weeks ago to
evaluate the building, determined that the walls must be replaced,
said Hal Lindsey, DWP's director of corporate health and safety.</TE>
<TE>   Though the yearlong wait will hamper the Los Angeles Unified
School District's expansion plans, officials said, caution about the
mold was the only option. The district learned a tough lesson about
caution with the controversial Belmont Learning Complex, which was
built on land emitting hazardous gas.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always something," said school board President Caprice
Young of the district's difficulties in providing new schools. "The
good news is that everyone is acting responsibly."</TE>
<TE>   Francis Poly High has an enrollment of 3,600, on a campus built
for 3,000. About 300 to 400 students are bused to other campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The new school, which was bought from the DWP for $50 million,
would have accommodated 800 students in September and 400 more
several months later, said Judy Burton, superintendent of the
district's northeast Valley area.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed that we're not starting [this year]," Burton
said. "But I am much more happy to have the problem completely
corrected before we move staff and students into the building."</TE>
<TE>   The building's first three floors are still being used by the DWP
as administrative offices. Lindsey said air samples have found the
building to be safe for the DWP workers. Nevertheless, he said, it
was necessary to inspect the building and replace walls because mold
has become an emotional issue for students, parents and educators.</TE>
<TE>   The unorthodox sharing of the complex was designed so that
students and DWP workers would have separate entrances to the site
and would not interfere with one another.</TE>
<TE>   The district has not built a high school since 1971. The Sun
Valley school would have been one of the first of 23 high schools
planned for completion by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   To ease overcrowding, the district plans to open 85 new schools by
that date.</TE>

<HD>Santa Paula Mayor's Wife Target of Probe</HD>
<DH>Crime: The DMV employee's home is searched for evidence
that she was part of a conspiracy to sell phony driver's licenses to
illegal immigrants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wife of Santa Paula's mayor is the subject of a probe by the
California Department of Motor Vehicles into whether she and others
conspired to sell driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, court
records show.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, investigators searched the home of Mayor Ray Luna and
his wife, Rosemarie Mejia-Luna, who has worked at the DMV office in
Santa Paula for 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities were seeking evidence of allegations that Mejia-Luna
was part of a network that distributed fraudulent driver's licenses
from September 1999 to December 2000, according to search warrant
affidavits filed last week in Ventura County Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   On at least six occasions, illegal Mexican immigrants paid from
$1,000 to $1,800 to apply for driver's licenses at other DMV offices
in Southern California and pass driving tests at the Santa Paula
field office, the documents state.</TE>
<TE>   Mejia-Luna's attorney, Robert Schwartz, said Monday that his
client "categorically denies any and all involvement with any illegal
activity."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Luna could not be reached for comment Monday. Last week, he
said he stood by his wife and thanked the community for supporting
the family under "this cloud of suspicion."</TE>
<TE>   DMV spokesman Bill Branch would not comment on the investigation,
but said no arrests have been made. He would not say whether
Mejia-Luna is still at work.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are expected to finish the probe in the next few
weeks and forward the information to the Ventura County district
attorney's office, which will decide whether to file criminal
charges, Branch said.</TE>
<TE>   To obtain a driver's license in California, applicants must show
proof of legal residence, pass written and driving tests and pay a
$12 fee. There is no cost for the driving test, Branch said.</TE>
<TE>   Search warrant affidavits served Feb. 14 on the Lunas' Santa Paula
home and on Mejia-Luna's workstation at the DMV office were filed
Friday afternoon in Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavits show that investigators interviewed six illegal
immigrants and a DMV manager in Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Two applicants for driver's licenses told DMV investigator Elva R.
Godoy in December 2000 that they had purchased their licenses from
Leticia Martinez and Carlos Savala. The documents did not state where
Martinez and Savala were based.</TE>
<TE>   According to the affidavits, Martinez, whom applicants knew as
"Jessica," and Savala arranged for applicants to apply for licenses
and take the written test at DMV offices in Bakersfield, Hollywood
and San Clemente using fake birth certificates.</TE>
<TE>   They typically charged $1,200, but some were charged as much as
$1,800, according to the documents.</TE>
<TE>   That price included $200 to $300 to guarantee that applicants
passed a driving test, which was conducted at the Santa Paula office.
Mejia-Luna administered those behind-the-wheel tests, the documents
state.</TE>
<TE>   On at least one occasion, she was observed taking money from the
car's console when the test was complete, the documents state.</TE>
<TE>   More than one of those interviewed also identified Mejia-Luna in a
photo lineup as the woman who gave them the driving test, which they
were told by Martinez or Savala that they would pass, the documents
state.</TE>
<TE>   In all six cases, the documents state, DMV records show that
Mejia-Luna updated computer records to indicate each person had
passed the driving test.</TE>
<TE>   That information was then sent to the agency's Sacramento
headquarters, which mails out licenses after checking residence and
citizenship information, Branch said.</TE>
<TE>   The items seized from Mejia-Luna's home on North 9th Street and
from the DMV office on West Harvard Boulevard include several scraps
of paper with phone numbers written on them, a day planner,
notebooks, a calendar, telephone records and a "deposit ticket."</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Monday that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approved a wider use of the company's NLite laser
system to include treatment of wrinkles in general.</LD>
<LD>   ICN, based in Costa Mesa, had received FDA clearance in August
2000 to market NLite only for treating wrinkles around the eyes.</LD>
<LD>   The non-cutting laser system uses laser light to stimulate the
body's own collagen layer to replenish itself. The procedure
typically takes about 20 minutes in a doctor's office and does not
require anesthesia or post-operative care.</LD>
<TE>   The stock closed at $29.75, down 39 cents a share, on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Software company Raining Data Corp., which announced earlier this
month that it was delaying its quarterly report and revising its
financial results downward, is facing delisting from Nasdaq. The
Irvine company said it will seek a hearing to stave off possible
delisting March 4.</LD>
<LD>   In mid-February, Raining Data said it would revise financial
results for six quarters to reflect accounting errors related to the
company's acquisition of a company and certain software in 2000.</LD>

$3.10, off 33 cents a share.</LD>

<HD>Harper Assails Proposal Aimed at Actors, Agents</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Screen Actors Guild presidential candidate Valerie Harper on Monday
criticized a tentative deal governing relations between actors and
talent agents, saying she is confident members will reject the accord
because of potential conflicts of interest.</LD>
<LD>   The most controversial part of the new "master franchise"
agreement would allow limited investments by ad agencies and
advertisers in talent agencies. Agents have pushed for a relaxing of
the rules so they can attract capital, but Harper and others say
joining agents with advertisers blurs the line between agent and
employer.</LD>
<LD>   "It is an absolute lie that agents won't become our employers,"
Harper said.</LD>

<HD>Congrats to Newlyweds-to-Be as They Start on Marriage Made
at Marathon</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The guests at the wedding of Maureen Kennedy and Brian Gillespie
should douse the couple with water, not rice, on Sunday. That's
because Kennedy and Gillespie are running in the L.A. Marathon, and
the marriage will take place when they reach Mile 6.</LD>
<LD>   The Moorpark couple met at that point during the 1998 marathon.
Right from the start, they learned the give-and-take of
relationships. Gillespie had trouble keeping up with Kennedy in that
race, so she slowed down.</LD>
<LD>   After the two take their vows, they'll run the remaining 20 miles
of the race--possibly the longest dash any newlyweds have ever taken
to their car.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The next fad in running shoes? The L.A. Marathon wouldn't be the
L.A. Marathon without an appearance by the "Coat Man."</TE>
<TE>   He has competed in all 16 and is entered in Sunday's race, where
he'll be identifiable as the guy in the decorated trench coat and
wingtip shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The Coat Man, whose real name is Dennis Marsella, is a resident of
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. His profession? Psychotherapist, of course.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Testing that brotherly love: When The Times' T.J. Simers slammed
the city of Philadelphia during the 76ers-Lakers NBA finals last
year, he received 7,121 nasty e-mails the next day (a high number
even for Simers).</TE>
<TE>   So you have to admire the courage of the sandwich merchant who
mangled the spelling of that great burg of the East, as spotted by
Jesse Taylor of Valley Village (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back to the marathon: O.J. Granzow of Santa Monica says that when
his wife, Inge, bought some new running socks for the race, she was a
bit surprised by one warning (see accompanying). Of course, I've
encountered some gym socks that smell like cheese.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You don't say: On a recent cruise, Ruth Siegall came upon the
co-leader in this week's "Duh!" competition (see  photo).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From the sea to the desert to all of ...: The media Web site
ronfineman.com caught KCAL-TV (Channel 9) anchorman Jerry Dunphy
wearing his KCAL 9 pin backward while doing a promo from the newsroom
the other day.</TE>
<TE>   An upside-down flag is the international sign for distress, but
it's no doubt just a coincidence that the mishap came as KCAL was
being sold to Viacom.</TE>
<TE>   Webmaster Ron Fineman had a simpler theory: "It looked fine in the
mirror."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Roadside commentary: Stephanie Wilson writes that she saw a car in
Newport Beach with a "license plate frame that had 'Football' at the
top and 'USC' at the bottom. The plate read GWT WIND. Does that mean
there's at least one SC football fan who is realistic about the
football program there?"</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, an admitted UCLA grad, added that, to be fair, the
Gone-With-the-Wind theme would go "equally well with a frame that
said 'UCLA Basketball.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The police blotter of the Aliso Viejo News reported
that someone near a golf course "called to say that men with golf
clubs were trying to fight with him. The fight started over a traffic
incident.... Deputies responded and found a suspect on Poplar, but
all the parties knew each other and declined any arrests. They agreed
to keep the peace."</TE>
<TE>   The item didn't say if the incident occurred when the men were in
golf carts.</TE>

<HD>Secessionists Favored on Utility Bills</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: A panel setting terms for a new Valley city
recommends that rates be equal to L.A.'s, and that assets be split by
geography.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A panel setting terms for San Fernando Valley secession recommended
Monday that a new city be given all physical assets within its
boundaries and pay utility rates no higher than those in the
remainder of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   A subcommittee of the Local Agency Formation Commission said
police stations, parks and other municipal properties in the Valley,
including Van Nuys Airport, should be transferred to a new city at no
cost. As part of the transfer, a Valley city would have to assume its
share of liabilities on the assets, such as outstanding bond debt.</LD>
<LD>   The subcommittee also said that Los Angeles should continue to
provide water and power service under a contract with the new Valley
city, and that it should treat Valley customers on an equal footing
with those remaining in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   ''It's only fair,'' said Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, who chairs the subcommittee on terms and conditions.</TE>
<TE>   ''The whole thinking here is the people of the San Fernando Valley
have helped pay for this infrastructure,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendations would remove major stumbling blocks to a
public vote on Valley cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   ''We are very pleased,'' said Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain.
''The Valley got its share of assets and got protection on utility
rates.''</TE>
<TE>   In one of the most contentious issues to emerge from the
hard-fought battle over secession, city officials had threatened to
charge higher water and power rates to customers of a new city in the
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said the subcommittee decided not to try to divide the
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, because it is working
well. The group recommended instead that it contract to serve a new
Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   ''We think the city should not punish the Valley by charging
usurious rates,'' Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Tim McOsker, chief of staff to Mayor James K. Hahn, questioned
whether the agency has authority to cap utility rates. The city
attorney's office has said it doesn't, but the county counsel's
office said it does.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendations go to the full Local Agency Formation
Commission for a vote on whether a secession ballot measure should
include the terms and conditions in a cityhood ballot measure.</TE>
<TE>   The subcommittee recommended that if voters approve a new Valley
city, all the physical assets, as well as its share of liabilities
and cash, be transferred to the new municipality when it begins
operation on Jan. 1, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secessionists and Los Angeles officials still have to work
out a vehicle for guaranteeing payment of liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Felipe Fuentes supported transfer of police and fire
stations and other assets as long as the breakup does not financially
harm the rest of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But McOsker and other city officials argued against transferring
Van Nuys Airport because they said it is an integral part of the city
airports system, which also includes Los Angeles International
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky was not moved.</TE>
<TE>   ''Van Nuys Airport is a money loser for Los Angeles, so I don't
know why the city is fighting so hard to keep it,'' Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that as the general aviation airfield has a major
impact on the environment and economy of the Valley, it should be
under the Valley city's control, if the Federal Aviation
Administration approves the transfer.</TE>

<HD>2,200 Student Newspapers Stolen, Thrown Away at USC</HD>
<DH>Theft: Copies of the Daily Trojan were removed Friday
morning. Incident may be linked to coverage of student elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC campus police are investigating the theft of about 2,200 copies
of the Daily Trojan student newspaper from kiosks at the
university--an incident they suggest is connected to coverage of
student elections.</LD>
<LD>   Before the morning drop-off had been completed Friday, copies of
the Daily Trojan were disappearing from various distribution sites on
campus and dumped into nearby garbage cans. Although hundreds were
found, most were never recovered.</LD>
<LD>   ''It definitely makes me angry,'' said Jennifer Medina, editor in
chief of the Daily Trojan. ''Regardless of what people say about
student newspapers--if 2,200 papers are missing, then 2,200 people
are missing the news.''</LD>
<TE>   The 9,000-circulation Monday-through-Friday paper is usually
distributed from 7 to 9 a.m., said Mona Cravens, director of student
publications. By 8 a.m., she became aware of the trashed newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Cravens said a janitor told her that he had found a bundle of 300
to 400 Daily Trojans in the student union trash bins and put them
back in the kiosks. Later that morning, Trojan staff members
discovered that other kiosks along the mall of the main campus were
missing newspapers. They also retrieved hundreds of copies from
garbage cans.</TE>
<TE>   But when the staff members retraced their steps, the papers were
again in the garbage. This game of cat-and-mouse happened at least
five times, Medina said. ''It was kind of bizarre,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   It was also a crime, said Deputy Chief Robert Taylor of the USC
Department of Public Safety. If the culprits are found, they will be
charged with misdemeanor theft, he said, which can carry a $500 fine
and six months in jail. Taylor expects the school's Office for
Student Conduct to weigh in with punishment as severe as suspension.</TE>
<TE>   ''Most people are outraged by this,'' he said. ''Academic
institutions are places for free expression. We hold that belief sort
of sacredly.''</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said he thinks the thefts were connected to Friday's lead
story in the 12-page Daily Trojan, which was headlined ''Debate fuels
heated race: Students gasp at verbal confrontation as candidates
aggressively defend their platforms.''</TE>
<TE>   The article focused on Thursday's debate between student body
presidential candidates Andrew Compton and Matt Weir, and their
competitive remarks toward each other.</TE>
<TE>   Public safety officers are following an anonymous e-mail tip and
questioning the candidates, according to Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   The officers also are more closely monitoring the newspaper
kiosks.</TE>
<TE>   Cravens said copies of the Daily Trojan have been stolen before,
but never so many.</TE>
<TE>   ''If this were to become a regular occurrence, we would have to
make sure that our distribution was much more focused,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   ''If anything,'' Medina said of the theft, ''it's a reminder for
our staff of how seriously we should take our paper.''</TE>

<LD>An Encino lawyer who once represented rap impresario Marion "Suge"
Knight pleaded guilty Monday to failing to disclose more than $4
million in earnings.</LD>
<LD>   David E. Kenner, 60, admitted that in 1994 he made $4.1 million,
income that prosecutors said he intentionally failed to disclose to
the Internal Revenue Service.</LD>
<LD>   Even after being advised in February 1997 that he was under
criminal investigation, Kenner failed to file an income tax return
until December of that year, prosecutors said.</LD>
<TE>   The criminal defense attorney could receive a maximum of one year
in federal prison and pay a $100,000 fine and additional taxes when
he is sentenced April 29 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Kenner's arrest grew out of a 6-year-old racketeering probe by the
U.S. Justice Department that focused on Death Row records and
included allegations of drug trafficking, money laundering and
violent acts, according to law enforcement and Death Row sources.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, federal officials say they were looking into whether
Death Row, the rap label run by Knight, was a criminal enterprise
with street gang affiliations and Mafia ties.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, who ran Death Row, was not charged in connection with the
government investigation.</TE>

<HD>Most Phone Service Restored After Cable Accident in Walnut</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Workers on Monday had restored most--but not all--telephone service
cut off last week by a construction accident that affected at least
828 and perhaps as many as 2,700 homes and businesses in the San
Gabriel Valley city of Walnut.</LD>
<LD>   Verizon spokeswoman Julia Wilson said that five days after
Wednesday's accident, when workers excavating for a new housing
project severed two cables, service had been restored to all but 2%
of the telephones affected.</LD>
<LD>   The remaining phones, mostly belonging to businesses, will be
working again in a day or two, Wilson said.</LD>
<TE>   Resident William Noyes said he lost service about 11 a.m.
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   His phone and that of a neighbor were still out Monday, Noyes
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said Verizon had received 828 "trouble calls" since
Wednesday, representing the minimum number of phones affected.</TE>
<TE>   However, the severed cables served 2,700 lines.</TE>
<TE>   "We regret any inconvenience to our customers in that area, and
we've been working very hard to get everything back into service,"
Wilson said.</TE>

Monday for threatening to harm or kill six Southwest Airlines
employees he first met by dialing the airline's reservation line.</LD>
<LD>   Federal Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. also ordered Larry J. Hirsch,
39, into a mental health program while serving his time.</LD>

them in conversations about astrology, learning enough personal
information to enable him to obtain their home numbers from the

<LD>A former senior auditor for the Times Mirror Co. pleaded guilty in
federal court Monday to illegal insider trading tied to the company's
acquisition by the Tribune Co.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel J. Wooten III, 38, of Torrance netted nearly $77,000 in
profits by buying 2,285 shares of Times Mirror stock in March 2000,
after receiving confidential information about the impending
takeover.</LD>
<LD>   Under terms of a plea agreement, prosecutors will recommend that
Wooten be placed on three years' probation, serving the first six
months under home detention.</LD>
<TE>   He would also have to surrender his stock trading profits and pay
a $3,000 fine, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. David Seide.</TE>

<HD>Judge Overturns 'Critical Habitat' of 2 Species</HD>
<DH>Environment: A new analysis of the economic effects of
setting aside more than 500,000 acres to protect the threatened
gnatcatcher and fairy shrimp is ordered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Los Angeles, acceding to a Bush administration
request, Monday invalidated protection of several hundred thousand
acres of land in Southern California deemed essential to the survival
of two imperiled species.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials have said the request is
part of a broad reevaluation of "critical habitat" designations
involving millions of acres of protected land, mainly in California.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists fear the administration's action is the first
step in a broad rollback of protections for rare plants and animals
covered by the Endangered Species Act.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a huge issue because there are so many other critical
habitat designations impacted," said William Snape, vice president of
legal affairs for Defenders of Wildlife, in Washington, D.C. "I think
it's upwards of 100 species whose habitats are hanging in the
balance."</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling Monday, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson said
the Fish and Wildlife Service must redo the economic analysis of the
effects of designating more than half a million acres as critical
habitat for the coastal California gnatcatcher, a tiny bird, and the
San Diego fairy shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate developers, ranchers and farmers have been lobbying
the Bush administration to make it easier and cheaper to build on
critical habitat in a number of places around the country.</TE>
<TE>   In the Southern California case, the judge left open the question
of whether existing protections would stay in place until a revised
economic analysis and new habitat designations are completed in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he will not rule on that issue until he receives
additional written arguments from attorneys representing the federal
wildlife agency and an environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   "To vacate the critical habitat in place would mean, for a period
of time, there would be no critical habitat," Wilson said during a
45-minute hearing. "The court's concern is, how can there be some
[protection] in the intervening period? ... There apparently is a
movement to begin development of at least part of the land."</TE>
<TE>   This is a key concern of environmentalists, who fear that
nullifying existing rules would remove major hurdles for two huge
developments--Rancho Mission Viejo's 14,000 homes and a toll
road--and allow the destruction of sensitive habitat in southern
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most controversial provisions of the Endangered Species
Act, critical habitat is a category of protected land in which
building and other activity can be limited or even barred to ensure
the survival of rare plants and animals. The land at issue in
Monday's hearing is covered with coastal sage scrub, where the
threatened gnatcatcher nests, and dotted with seasonal pools that are
home to the endangered fairy shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the Fish and Wildlife Service designated 513,650 acres in
Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, San Bernardino and Riverside counties
as critical habitat for the gnatcatcher, and 4,025 acres in Orange
and San Diego counties for the fairy shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   Kristen Gustafson, the U.S. Justice Department attorney
representing the Fish and Wildlife Service, said lifting the land
protection would not affect the species. "The gnatcatcher and fairy
shrimp will not suffer harm if the habitat were vacated," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said both creatures would be adequately protected by other
sections of the Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Wetzler, a lawyer who represented the Natural Resources
Defense Council at the hearing, disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no clearer indication of the importance of critical
habitat than the fact that Rancho Mission Viejo and the
transportation corridor agencies are suing to overturn it," Wetzler
said after the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously disappointed that the service once again failed
to defend its own regulations," he said. The administration's request
to eliminate the designations coincides with a slew of lawsuits
brought by developers and other landowners nationwide, challenging
how the government conducted its financial analyses of the effect of
designating critical habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Before designating habitat, the service is legally required to
analyze the economic consequences for developers, property owners,
cities and others who have an interest in the land. Until last year,
nearly all those analyses had said creating critical habitat would
have little to no economic effect.</TE>
<TE>   Developers and others have long argued that habitat designations
were far costlier than the government estimated. One developer-funded
study in California estimated that the gnatcatcher critical habitat
alone would cost the state $5.5 billion in lost jobs, housing and
property value over 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   For many property owners, the designations amount to little more
than lines on a map. But compliance can be difficult for landowners
dependent on federal subsidies or permits--as many major developers
and road builders are.</TE>
<TE>   "This [ruling] is further confirmation of our belief that the law
requires a real thorough economic analysis," said Rob Thornton, a
lawyer representing the Building Industry Assn. of Southern
California, the toll road builders and others.</TE>
<TE>   The Fish and Wildlife Service agreed that a new economic analysis
was needed, citing a federal appeals court ruling in May that struck
down protection of stream-side habitat in New Mexico for another
bird, the Southwestern willow flycatcher.</TE>
<TE>   The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the process used to
decide what lands to protect did not adequately analyze the financial
effect on property owners and others who make a living from the land.</TE>
<TE>   Federal wildlife officials have said they were trying to be
consistent with that ruling by reviewing up to 10 habitat
designations that protect millions of acres of land.</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Riordan Put Lobbyists on 21 City Commissions</HD>
<DH>Government: Some were surprised by candidate's remarks that
he'd limit their access as governor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER and MICHAEL J. GOODMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As mayor of Los Angeles, Republican gubernatorial candidate Richard
Riordan appointed nearly two dozen lobbyists to commissions
overseeing some of the city's most powerful agencies, a Times
analysis shows.</LD>
<LD>   So some of those lobbyists were surprised to hear Riordan profess
strong distrust and disdain for lobbyists and their profession on the
campaign trail last week. If he is elected governor, Riordan said, he
would not allow lobbyists into his office, and he downplayed the need
for their services.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan appointed lobbyists to 21 city commissions overseeing such
departments and agencies as the Harbor, Airport, Transportation,
Zoning, Planning, Building and Safety, Water and Power, Recreation
and Parks, and Redevelopment.</LD>
<TE>   In each case, Riordan's appointees either were registered city
lobbyists when they were selected or they registered while serving on
those civic panels, an examination of City Council and ethics
commission records found.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign aides said Riordan was unavailable for comment Monday.
His senior policy advisor, Jaime de la Vega, said the former mayor's
appointment of lobbyists to commissions is a "nonissue."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's "primary point [in his remarks last week] was that you
did not need to hire a lobbyist to have access to Dick Riordan as
mayor, and you will not need to hire a lobbyist to have access to
Dick Riordan as governor," said de la Vega, who worked for Riordan in
City Hall. Riordan faces two main challengers in next week's primary
election, financier Bill Simon Jr. and Secretary of State Bill Jones.</TE>
<TE>   As mayor, de la Vega said, Riordan generally did not meet alone
with lobbyists, preferring to meet with principals rather than their
paid representatives. He encouraged his staff to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   This is a familiar refrain for Riordan, who raised the lobbyist
issue during his first campaign for mayor in 1993. After he was
elected, he required that his staff record all contacts with
lobbyists, but that effort was short-lived, according to people who
worked in Riordan's first administration.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate it, I hate it with a passion," Riordan said at that time,
referring to the lobbying industry. "You need a godfather [at City
Hall] if you want something. Any day at City Hall you can find
[lobbyists] wandering about."</TE>
<TE>   But documents and interviews show that Riordan relied on lobbyists
in a variety of ways when he was mayor. Aside from appointing nearly
two dozen to commissions, he also hired some to help with special
projects, including running campaigns for charter reform amendments
and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   Registered lobbyists, in fact, were found among Riordan's inner
circle, his business associates and his most trusted mayoral staff.
His law firm, Riordan &amp; McKinzie, registered as city lobbyists in
1993, the year Riordan became mayor. Several of Riordan's deputy
mayors became registered lobbyists after they left office.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' citizen panels were designed to ensure public
participation in government business. Commissions are also powerful
tools for mayors to shape and direct policy. Mayors appoint about 200
of these mostly volunteer commissioners, who are given the authority
to oversee departments and award contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Some people object to the appointment of lobbyists to these
positions because the practice presents potential conflicts.
Lobbyists--184 were registered with the city in 2001--are paid to
influence legislation and shape policy on behalf of their clients.
They are a tight-knit group in City Hall who frequently share
projects and clients; they also hire one another for particular
campaigns and other efforts. Several also are political campaign
consultants.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do we have to have lobbyists on city commissions at all?"
asked Bob Stern, head of the Center for Governmental Studies in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are an awful lot of other people out there who
could serve. The other question in my mind is how much benefit do
they get serving on a commission, how much does it benefit their
lobbying practice?"</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, some people, including several lobbyists, say
they bring valuable knowledge of the inner workings of City Hall to
these panels. They say they understand politics, and they can
navigate through the maze of the bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Afriat, for example, said he negotiated the resignation of
the general manager of the animal regulation department while serving
on that commission as a Riordan appointee. Afriat, a top City Hall
lobbyist, said he was able to work with the City Council and the
mayor's office on behalf of the general manager, who ended up leaving
his job without suing the city.</TE>
<TE>   "Should there be 100 of us? I don't know," said Afriat, who was
appointed by Riordan in 1995 to the commission and hired by Riordan a
couple of times to run campaigns. "We bring some great skills, and we
should be sprinkled around just like smart attorneys and homeowners'
activists."</TE>
<TE>   Afriat and other lobbyists who served on commissions appointed by
Riordan said they were surprised by the former mayor's recent
comments, because these people felt welcome in City Hall during his
eight-year tenure there. Afriat called Riordan hypocritical and
disingenuous in his comments, saying there was a "swinging door" for
lobbyists in the mayor's office.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Specht, an attorney and registered lobbyist who was appointed
as a Recreation and Parks commissioner in 1994 and reappointed in
1999, said one of Riordan's strengths as mayor was that he listened
to various points of view on any issue.</TE>
<TE>   "He made decisions based on information from all sources,
including lobbyists," Specht said. "He wanted the facts, he wanted
information. I was surprised by his comments."</TE>
<TE>   The city's ethics commission in 1996 attempted to draft
legislation to limit lobbying--and fund-raising--by city
commissioners; that ordinance, however, became stalled in a council
committee and was never enacted. It is noteworthy that several
lobbyists also serve as campaign consultants to some council members.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Lawson, who was appointed by former Mayor Tom Bradley to the
Los Angeles Convention and Exhibition Center Authority in 1989 and
reappointed twice by Riordan, said he asked the mayor's staff to
place him on a commission unrelated to his development lobbying
activities. The mayor makes his selections for commissioners, and the
council confirms them.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, Riordan shuffled lobbyists from one commission to
another. And at any given time, 10 or more city commissions contained
registered lobbyists who also represented private clients. When
Riordan left office in 2001, for example, at least 11 commissioners
were also registered lobbyists with a combined list of about 60
clients.</TE>
<TE>   Some lobbyists and others say these city commissioners benefit
from the perception that they have an in at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "I think anyone--lobbyist or not--benefits from being named a
commissioner by a mayor, period," said Carol Schatz, president of the
Central Cities Assn., who was appointed to the Convention and
Exhibition Center Authority. "There are only a certain number of
spots. It indicates that the most important official in the city
knows who you are."</TE>

<HD>Condit Battles Foes, Scandal</HD>
<DH>Politics: Dogged by the Chandra Levy case, the six-term
congressman's moment of truth is at hand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>In the last days of what may be his last campaign, Gary Condit does
his best imitation of the charmed politician who hardly broke a sweat
as he glided from City Council to state Assembly to six terms in the
U.S. House of Representatives.</LD>
<LD>   Local TV cameras dog his every move, from the Yum Yum doughnut
shop in Stockton to an Hispanic Chamber of Commerce meeting in
Merced. He makes a coy game of playing past them. His smile still
wows the older ladies, and on good hair days he still resembles the
cover boy posing astride horses and Harleys for his "Condit Country"
brochures.</LD>
<LD>   But Condit is a man chased weary by the ghost of a scandal. Not
even TV's "10 extra pounds" can hide his gauntness.</LD>
<TE>   In his nearly three decades of political office, the 53-year-old
Condit has never waged a more personal--and uphill--battle. He is
running against the politician he mentored, Assemblyman Dennis
Cardoza (D-Merced), and in the after-glare of revelations about his
relationship with missing intern Chandra Levy.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 10-month scandal has cost him dearly as a politician,
friends and foes say his core of support remains too substantial to
simply write off his candidacy. He has never worked harder at
reelection, they say, or reached out to a more diverse collection of
groups.</TE>
<TE>   In an 18th Congressional District redrawn to include the minority
communities of Stockton, it was Condit--not Democratic front-runner
Cardoza--who went to black Baptist and Pentecostal churches to ask
for support.</TE>
<TE>   "We had him on the hot seat for about 20 minutes and he answered
every question, even the ones about the missing intern," said Floyd
Weaver, a black community leader and former vice mayor of Stockton.
"It went very well. So well that no one called me afterward and said,
'Why did you bring that guy to us.'"</TE>
<TE>   Up and down the campaign trail, Condit blames the scandal on the
gluttony of a national media gone tabloid silly. In the manner of his
interview with TV's Connie Chung last summer, he dodges questions
about any extramarital affairs and what they imply about a man whose
past campaigns were built on the themes of family and trust.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout much of the race, his three main opponents have treaded
lightly on the issue. They fear that Condit's anti-media message has
struck a chord with voters and that any harping on the scandal might
backfire and paint the Condits as victims. In a region where nearly
one-third of the population receives public assistance and the
unemployment rate remains stuck in double digits, the debate is
mostly about jobs and education, how to grow suburbs and light
industry while still preserving the engine of agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Then last week, it was the Condits who went out of their way to
return the scandal to front and center. On the same day the
congressman met with voters to voice his concern about the San
Joaquin Valley's dreadful air quality, his wife, Carolyn, stood on
the steps of the federal courthouse here to announce that she had
filed a $10-million libel lawsuit against the National Enquirer.</TE>
<TE>   The tabloid had published a story last August alleging that on the
eve of Levy's May 1 disappearance, the 24-year-old intern and Carolyn
Condit had a vicious telephone argument. "Cops: Condit's Wife
Attacked Chandra," the Enquirer headline read.</TE>
<TE>   Flanked by her lawyers, who stressed that such a conversation with
Levy never took place, Carolyn Condit called the article "unjust and
very hurtful." Political experts question the wisdom of filing the
suit amid her husband's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The political upside would be that it reinforces the notion of
the Condits as victims of a relentless press that bears them ill
will," said Ed Costantini, who teaches political science at UC Davis.
"But there's also a downside. It reminds voters of the sordidness of
the whole Chandra Levy scandal and the hypocrisy of a politician who
has paraded virtue as one of his credentials."</TE>
<TE>   Condit may be the most vulnerable of California's 52 House members
seeking reelection, but Costantini and others don't give much weight
to polls showing him trailing Cardoza by eight or more percentage
points. They point out that people might be unwilling to publicly
admit they are going to vote for Condit--simply to spare themselves a
lecture from relatives or friends who oppose him. When the curtain
closes on the voting booth, they could very well take glee in marking
"Condit."</TE>
<TE>   "What people say and what they do in the booth is two different
things," said state Sen. Dick Monteith (R-Modesto), the front-runner
in the Republican primary for the 18th Congressional District.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary is beating the bushes and taking nothing for granted," he
said. "I wouldn't be surprised to see him win."</TE>
<TE>   The news crews that camped day and night outside Condit's Modesto
office and Ceres home are now gone, but both places remain
bunker-like with a cadre of die-hard staff, supporters and family
encircling the congressman.</TE>
<TE>   His children, Chad, 34, and Cadee, 26, quit their jobs with Gov.
Gray Davis (they thought Davis came to their beleaguered father's
side too late and halfheartedly) and moved back into their parents'
cramped house. The entire campaign is a family affair.</TE>
<TE>   The Condits find ways to stretch the budget and decide which
reporters the congressman should talk to and which reporters are best
kept at bay.</TE>
<TE>   In an appearance on CNN's "Larry King Live" program Monday night ,
Condit's children again were at his side.</TE>
<TE>   "They are such honorable people, I don't know if I can ever repay
them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Condit again refused to discuss Levy, saying, "I am not going to
go into that. I'm just not going into that." When pressed by a viewer
who called the show, Condit said, "I had nothing to do with the
disappearance of Chandra Levy, not one single thing."</TE>
<TE>   The congressman did not return repeated phone calls from The Times
seeking comment on the race.</TE>
<TE>   As the campaign heads into its final week, some foes have decided
to take off the gloves and raise questions about his personal conduct
and whether it has hampered his ability to serve the district.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a host of questions that Gary has yet to answer," said
Doug White, the campaign manager for Cardoza, who has outspent Condit
by more than 3 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary has never apologized to this community for making it a
laughingstock. He's never said, 'I'm sorry' to his constituents for
making them the butt of jokes on Leno and Letterman.</TE>
<TE>   "He keeps playing the victim, but everything that happened is a
direct result of the personal and public decisions he'd made. If he
doesn't have an affair with Chandra Levy, he doesn't get thrust into
a scandal."</TE>

<HD>Missing Girl Dead, Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Crime: Prosecutors will charge a neighbor with the murder
of Danielle van Dam, 7, though no body has been found.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD  and DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors here have concluded that 7-year-old Danielle van Dam, who
vanished from her canopy bed more than three weeks ago, is dead, and
they will charge a neighbor with her murder today even though no body
has been found.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego County Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst said at a news
conference Monday that the new charge against David Westerfield will
come with a "special circumstance" that could allow prosecutors to
seek the death penalty. Westerfield, a self-employed design engineer
who lives two doors away from the Van Dams, is already under arrest
on suspicion of kidnapping.</LD>
<LD>   Pfingst said the enormous publicity in the case and the length of
time since Danielle disappeared lead him to believe she is dead.</LD>
<TE>   "There has been an extraordinary search," Pfingst said. "She is
extremely well-known to all San Diegans. No one has seen her. That,
in conjunction with the evidence, provides only one reasonable
conclusion and that is that Danielle van Dam is no longer living."</TE>
<TE>   At the headquarters of a search-and-recovery operation, volunteers
continued to scour the vast desert east of San Diego, where police
believe Westerfield drove his motor home on the morning Danielle
disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "The police have their investigation and that's different from our
search," said Paula Call, a family spokeswoman. "We are continuing to
look for her. You have to hold out hope."</TE>
<TE>   But neighbors and other supporters--though many of them have long
feared that Danielle is dead--grew dejected Monday in the wake of
Pfingst's announcement. Monday afternoon, two women abruptly pulled
into Westerfield's driveway and stuck a hand-painted sign in one of
his planters that said, "We want Danielle today. Please confess."</TE>
<TE>   "I was sure she was dead, but it was disheartening to hear them
say that they have no evidence that she is alive," said Marc Worley,
38, a neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield, who turned 50 on Monday, is being held in a San Diego
County jail without bail. Officials say he is the only suspect in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   He will be arraigned this morning in a downtown courtroom. Pfingst
said he may face additional charges of burglary and possession of
child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield's attorney, Steven Feldman, could not be reached for
comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Van Dams' white, five-bedroom home was empty most of the day
Monday until the couple pulled up at about 5:30 p.m. Brenda and Damon
van Dam declined to speak to reporters at length. But, asked how they
were feeling, Brenda said: "Terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the sun had begun to fade a large pile of notes and gifts
left by neighbors, who have been captivated and terrified by
Danielle's disappearance. A table contained several stuffed animals
left for her by friends and soccer teammates, including a purple
teddy bear with a note pinned to its ear: "We hope you can hold this
teddy bear really soon. All of us miss you and want you to come home
safe."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Police Department spokesman Dave Cohen said late Monday
that there was no evidence that Danielle's remains have been found.</TE>
<TE>   A Crestline man who volunteered to search for Danielle over the
weekend said in an interview that he discovered some bones near
Alpine, off Interstate 8 northeast of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The man, Ken Cress, was carrying a global positioning device and
said he alerted authorities to the location. Cress said he did not
believe it likely that the bones were human, but he would not discuss
his discovery in detail because he did not want to jeopardize the
investigation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst said he summoned Danielle's parents to his office over the
weekend to discuss the pending murder charge. The district attorney,
the father of two elementary school-age daughters, said the
conversation was emotional.</TE>
<TE>   "It was difficult to bring out the word 'murder,'" he said. "They
cried. It was difficult for them."</TE>
<TE>   Danielle's parents discovered that she was not in bed when they
went to wake her the morning of Feb. 2. They told investigators that
a sliding glass door in the family room and a side door to the garage
were open.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle had been home with her two brothers and father the night
before while her mother was at a local bar with friends. Danielle's
mother ran into Westerfield at the bar and talked to him briefly,
authorities say. Westerfield has he said he danced with Brenda van
Dam there. The Van Dams have said they barely know Westerfield.</TE>
<TE>   Police immediately began focusing on Westerfield, apparently the
only one of the Van Dams' neighbors to leave the posh Sabre Springs
community, about 20 miles northeast of downtown San Diego, the
morning Danielle vanished. Authorities believe Westerfield drove his
motor home to the Imperial Valley desert that day, then had it
steam-cleaned before police could examine it.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say they have since found traces of Danielle's blood
in the motor home and on an article of his clothing. DNA tests
confirmed that the blood belonged to Danielle. Pfingst said Monday
that the results of additional DNA tests conducted by the FBI are
expected to arrive in his office soon.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst said his office would forge ahead with the prosecution
whether or not investigators discover Danielle's body. His office
cited four cases, some dating to 1983, in which San Diego County
murder suspects were convicted--and two sent to death row--despite
the fact that investigators were unable to locate the victim's body.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Steps Up Campaign to Justify Stance on Parks</HD>
<DH>Police: Mayor focuses on convincing the public that new
leadership is needed at the LAPD.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jolted by angry reaction to his opposition to Los Angeles Police
Chief Bernard C. Parks' reappointment, Mayor James K. Hahn has
stepped up his public appearances and embarked on the unusual mission
of trying to convince residents that their city is becoming more
dangerous--and therefore that the LAPD needs new leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn and his staff also are working behind the scenes, trying to
win the support of the city's opinion makers. His schedule has been
rearranged because of the controversy, and Hahn has set aside time to
try to reassure longtime backers--especially leaders of the city's
African American communities and churches.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the state of the Los Angeles Police Department and
the question of who should lead it have dominated the mayor's public
message and commanded more of his attention than any other issue
since he took office in July, aides and others close to Hahn said.</LD>
<TE>   "Early in every administration, you get to a point where you're
challenged, and that point is where many chief executives are then
defined," said political consultant Bill Carrick, who ran Hahn's
mayoral campaign. "Jim's leadership is being defined by this."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's approach to the controversy has ramifications beyond the
issue of Parks' selection: By concentrating on the city's crime
problem, Hahn may strengthen the arguments of secession advocates,
who say Los Angeles is too big to be governed effectively and that a
smaller city would better address residents' needs.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with intense public reaction, particularly among African
Americans, the mayor also has been forced into an odd campaign
against a prominent official of his government. Parks has appeared
almost daily on local television and radio to defend his performance,
and Hahn is regularly asked to respond.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's decision to oppose the chief has won him some admiration
for forcefulness, but so far his efforts to explain his move have not
always been effective, according to some of the city's political
experts. They say the mayor missed the opportunity to raise questions
about the chief's performance before Parks declared his intention to
seek a second term. Since then, Hahn has failed to rally others to
his position, the mayor's critics contend.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the mayor has yet found a cohesive message that
resonates throughout the city on the Parks issue," said political
consultant Harvey Englander. "The way it's been handled has not been
with the greatest political finesse."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Hahn said he is not focused on the political
implications of his decisions, and insisted that he is talking about
public safety issues around the city because he is worried about the
recent jump in crime. In the last two years, violent crime has
increased 17%.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing has really been generated by the fact that we've seen
a recent upsurge in the city," he said. "January was a terrible month
for us in terms of increased homicides." But Hahn acknowledged that
his message about crime and LAPD staffing highlights the reasons he
gave for opposing Parks' reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   So concerned is Hahn over the LAPD's priorities, aides said, that
he met with the city's chief administrative officer for two hours
last week to discuss reshaping the Police Department's budget. Parks
was not present for that meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Since Hahn declared his opposition to Parks, the mayor has held a
series of events around the city to make his case for change at the
LAPD. On Monday he met with residents in Boyle Heights to lay out a
community policing plan.</TE>
<TE>   In every case, Hahn avoided talking about the chief, and changed
the subject when others brought up the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Even when Hahn has tried to turn to other issues, he has been
interrupted by the debate over Parks' future.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Hahn was working his way through a series of long
meetings with department heads over next year's tight financial
situation.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's schedule was cleared for the meetings, and the mayor was
expected to stay out of public sight for several days. But by midday
on the second day, aides pulled him away from the budget conferences
to respond to a group of black clergy accusing Hahn of trying to buy
their silence on Parks by giving their churches $25,000 city grants.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 30 minutes, Hahn stood behind a lectern in a City
Hall media conference room, defending himself against the charges.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, during a visit to a North Hollywood elementary
school to commemorate expansion of the after-school program LA's
BEST, Hahn asked reporters to limit their questions to those
concerning the program.</TE>
<TE>   But after a few minutes, a television reporter asked the mayor how
he felt about the black ministers ripping up their checks from the
city. Hahn sighed. "Any more questions about LA's BEST?" he asked,
surveying the gaggle of cameras surrounding him.</TE>
<TE>   No one spoke.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the criticism, Hahn has stood resolutely by his decision
to oppose Parks' reappointment. That has won him praise in some
quarters, as backers say it has demonstrated his command.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting aside the decision itself, I think the effect of it is to
reflect another dimension to the mayor, that there is a toughness
about him and a decisiveness and an independence that many people
were not aware of," said attorney George Kieffer, a longtime
confidant of the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he has paid a price for his determination.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't expect even my friends to agree with me all the time, but
certainly there are times that it saddens me to see the level of
rhetoric," Hahn said in another interview. "I hope the people that
know me know I am just doing what I think is right."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's public campaign to explain his decision and to raise
questions about the LAPD has been matched by private efforts to
assuage the anger some backers have voiced.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-February, he met with Ken Lombard, business partner of
basketball star and entrepreneur Earvin "Magic" Johnson. He is
scheduled to meet with Johnson in the coming week.</TE>
<TE>   Both men were among a dozen African American activists and leaders
who tried to negotiate an agreement between the mayor and the chief
before Hahn decided to oppose Parks' reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Lombard said his recent conversation with Hahn convinced him the
mayor is genuinely upset that so many of his supporters are
disappointed in him. But Lombard, who supported Hahn in the mayor's
race, said he continues to feel betrayed by him now.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the fact that we obviously like Mayor Hahn," he said, "I
think it is going to be extremely hard to rebuild that trust."</TE>

<HD>Court Hears Appeal in Compton Dispute</HD>
<DH>Election: Attorneys argue about the ballot-listing theory
that led a judge to overturn the results in the city's bitter mayoral
race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The legal battle over Compton's recent election moved to an appeals
court Monday, where lawyers traded barbs over the "primacy effect"
theory that swayed a judge to oust Mayor Eric Perrodin from office.</LD>
<LD>   In an unprecedented decision earlier this month, Los Angeles
Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin replaced Perrodin with his
opponent, Omar Bradley, after ruling that Perrodin had unfairly
benefited from being listed first on the ballot in last year's
election.</LD>
<LD>   Perrodin's attorney, Frederic Woocher, said at the hearing that
Chirlin's decision relied on the flawed testimony of a political
scientist who misapplied the primacy effect theory and did little
research to support his findings.</LD>
<TE>   Perrodin wants the appeals court to suspend Chirlin's ruling and
reinstate him as mayor until a decision is reached on the appeal.
Chirlin had ruled that the candidates' names were not listed lawfully
on the June 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not science. It's not even political science," said Woocher,
referring to the theory. "The Superior Court had no warrant for
taking 306 votes and giving them to [Bradley] at the stroke of a
pen."</TE>
<TE>   Bradley's attorney, Bradley W. Hertz, defended the testimony of
the expert witness, Ohio State University professor Jon Krosnick,
saying that Krosnick's research was exhaustive, detailed and
accurate.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not junk science. It is not fuzzy math," Hertz said.
"Everyone should get a fair shake with every new election."</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin's name did not appear first on last year's primary
ballot, but it did appear before Bradley's. It also appeared before
Bradley's on the ballot for the June runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Chirlin ruled that the city clerk improperly lifted the name order
off the primary ballot, instead of using a method to randomly select
the order. Perrodin's position on the second ballot, the judge said,
gave him an improper statistical advantage that won him at least 306
votes, enough to prevail in the close race.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing at the 2nd District Court of Appeal in downtown Los
Angeles was held in a courtroom crowded with about 90 supporters of
both Perrodin and Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin argues that Compton will suffer irreparable harm if
Bradley remains in office while his appeal is pending. He fears that
Bradley will use taxpayers' money to pay as much as $1 million of his
attorney fees and back wages.</TE>
<TE>   The Compton City Council is scheduled to discuss several claims by
Bradley and his attorney at today's council meeting. Bradley has said
that he will recuse himself from discussions or votes on those
matters.</TE>
<TE>   Though the three appellate justices did not reach a decision
Monday--a ruling is expected sometime this week--they did question
Hertz several times, asking for clarification and posing hypothetical
situations.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Associate Justice Reuben Ortega asked Hertz if he
thought that all elections are now suspect because of the primacy
effect, which holds that people tend to favor choices at the top of a
list.</TE>
<TE>   Hertz said that not all races were flawed, but that some with
narrow margins of victory could be open to challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Presiding Justice Vaino Spencer questioned why the primacy effect
didn't make a difference in Compton's primary election, where the
first candidate on the ballot, Basil Kimbrew, trailed far behind
Perrodin and Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   She also wanted to know how much research the expert witness had
done, and questioned if Krosnick's analysis, based on an Ohio study,
was relevant to Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Hertz did not say exactly how much time Krosnick spent on his
analysis, but said it was thorough. He said that the primacy effect
theory always holds, but that it varies from place to place.</TE>
<TE>   Woocher scoffed at his explanations.</TE>
<TE>   "It just points out the absurdity of relying on that information
to overturn the will of the people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Nancy Wride contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Supervisors to Vote on John Wayne Restrictions</HD>
<DH>Airport: Today's decision may slightly raise the annual cap
to 9.8 million passengers through 2015 and continue the ban on
late-night flights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County supervisors will vote today on extending landmark
restrictions on the size of John Wayne Airport--just one week before
county voters will decide whether to scrap plans to build a new
airport at El Toro.</LD>
<LD>   The deciding vote is expected to come from Supervisor Todd
Spitzer, who will be calling in from Washington, D.C. He flew there
Monday to attend meetings with federal highway officials in his role
as chairman of the Orange County Transportation Authority.</LD>
<LD>   The unusual link by speakerphone into today's meeting is allowed
under state law, as long as a meeting notice is posted where Spitzer
will be making the call--from the office of Rep. Christopher Cox
(R-Newport Beach).</LD>
<TE>   Spitzer was traveling Monday and couldn't be reached for comment.
But county staffers and officials with cities beneath the flight path
for John Wayne said he indicated during heavy lobbying in recent
weeks that he would support extending restrictions at the airport.
The limits--contained in an agreement ratified by a federal judge in
1985--are set to expire on Dec. 31, 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, the airport can handle up to 8.4 million
passengers a year through 2005; last year, about 7.3 million
passengers used John Wayne. The airport also is limited to 73 daily
flights by the loudest aircraft. Bonus flights allowed to airlines
using quieter jets bump the flights up to about 130 a day.</TE>
<TE>   The plan supervisors favor is one promoted by Newport Beach. It
would allow a small increase in passengers in exchange for capping
the size of John Wayne through 2015. The number of passengers would
rise to 9.8 million a year and regulated flights would increase to
85; the airport would also add four gates, to total 18.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by Newport Beach, the county and two Newport Beach
citizen groups--the entities that signed the original agreement--the
new limits would take effect immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of what happens in the election, John Wayne Airport
only has limited capacity without it being a huge trauma to the
[cities under the flight path]," Newport Beach City Manager Homer
Bludau said. "We think this is a good, solid plan."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors Jim Silva and Cynthia P. Coad have supported Newport
Beach's effort to lock in a small expansion at John Wayne before
voters go to the polls next week. Silva began representing Newport
Beach this year when district boundaries were redrawn. Supervisor
Chuck Smith, who with Silva and Coad forms the board majority
promoting an airport at the closed El Toro Marine Corps Air Station,
has parted with his colleagues on John Wayne's future. He said
supervisors shouldn't cut off their options for expanding air travel
if voters ground the new airport.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson also has resisted recent efforts by Newport
Beach. He said Monday that he still has reservations but declined to
say how he would vote. In May, while still representing Newport Beach
before remapping changed his district's boundaries, Wilson voted
against the city's plan for John Wayne, calling it a "rush to
judgment."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has changed his position before regarding the John Wayne
restrictions. In December 2000, he was conciliatory toward Newport
Beach, saying then that no single community should be expected to
balance the county's demand for air travel "on their backs."</TE>
<TE>   But in May he said that changing the airport's operating agreement
would be a "big risk" if the county and city acted without consulting
the airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach and county officials contend that the restrictions
can be extended without the carriers' or FAA's approval. The airlines
have indicated they will fight attempts to keep restrictions past
2005.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's comments reflect the complicated views on John Wayne
held by those who oppose an El Toro airport. While some in the
anti-airport movement support John Wayne's growth to about 14 million
passengers a year--the most it could physically handle, according to
county planners--others say the airport should stay its current size,
with passengers using such airports as those in Los Angeles or
Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach officials fear that pressure will grow to expand
John Wayne if a new facility isn't built at El Toro. Newport Beach
and Irvine are the cities most affected by flights departing John
Wayne. Cities under the arrival flight path include Villa Park,
Orange, Tustin, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   The county has enforced a nighttime curfew at John Wayne since
1968. Commercial takeoffs are banned between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., and
arrivals between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach and county officials contend that the flight curfew
and noise restrictions will remain in place indefinitely, despite the
2005 expiration date, because they were adopted five years before a
change in federal law that barred local governments from regulating
airports. But those protections would not apply to a new airport at
El Toro, a major reason for the opposition.</TE>

<HD>Music Center's Bravo Award Goes to O.C.'s Multi-Tasking
Maestro</HD>
<DH>Arts: Mike Short-- Orange High School choir teacher, band
leader and dynamo--is honored for his work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Music, they say, can transport you.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday evening, it took Mike Short, an Orange choir teacher,
from a cramped high school classroom where he has taught for 20 years
to the glow of the spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   Short, 45, is this year's winner of the Bravo Award for
outstanding arts teacher, presented by the Music Center of Los
Angeles County.</LD>
<TE>   The 20-year-old award was created to promote arts education in
Southern California's private and public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Judges select winners in three categories: exceptional school,
arts teacher and general-subjects teacher who incorporates the arts
into the academic curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   Short, who teaches at Orange High School, pushes to bring music
classes to children of all experience and ability levels, even
pitching in to teach an early morning band class for no extra pay.</TE>
<TE>   "I am as excited as I can get," an elated Short said from the
Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, where the awards were presented. Other
winners were Arcadia High School in Los Angeles County as exceptional
school, and Laura Hamlett, 32, a second-grade teacher at Eagle Rock
Elementary School in Los Angeles, as general-subjects teacher.</TE>
<TE>   For Short, chosen from 30 nominated arts teachers, the award means
recognition--plus $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how people say a few people do all the work? Well, Mike
is one of the few," said Orange High Principal Robert Lewis, who
nominated Short and accompanied him to the awards ceremony, along
with Short's family and school district officials. "The guy goes a
thousand miles an hour."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when the school lost its band teacher, Short stepped in
to save the program by volunteering to come in early and teach the
class, Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   The district plans to hire a new band teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, Short and a middle-school teacher proposed
reintroducing arts education to elementary schools.</TE>
<TE>   They worked on curricula, giving the district board several
spending options. Trustees agreed to spend $750,000 a year on the
program.</TE>
<TE>   Short's energy was evident one recent morning during a concert
choir class at the high school.</TE>
<TE>   Young voices spilled from the classroom. Inside, 35 boys and 53
girls formed a semicircle around Short, who, dressed in jeans and
cowboy boots, was warming up the students' vocal cords.</TE>
<TE>   "Louder, louder," Short urged as his aide, Caryl Smith,
accompanied on piano.</TE>
<TE>   Short Teaches in a Room Filled With Memories</TE>
<TE>   The room was crammed with computer and music equipment, file
cabinets, boxes of sheet music and 20 years of memories, including a
1999 theatrical poster for a Russian production of the musical
"Hair." The show starred one of his students. "He didn't even speak
Russian," Short said. Along the walls were pictures of his graduating
classes, each a little larger, each a little more ethnically diverse,
chronicling the changing demographics of the working-class community
surrounding the school.</TE>
<TE>   The day's repertoire included an African song and Robert Ray's
"Lord Have Mercy," a gospel score.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year we did Vivaldi's 'Gloria,'" Short said. "I want them to
explore lots of different styles, from medieval to contemporary.
Notice I said 'contemporary,' not 'pop.' They get enough of that on
their own time."</TE>
<TE>   From football players to band members, the students follow his
hand gestures and coaching advice.</TE>
<TE>   During a section of "Lord Have Mercy," the tenors struggled with a
tone change. Short had them try various tricks; none worked until he
told them to imagine they were sticking their heads out the window of
a car and singing into the wind.</TE>
<TE>   Giggles filled the room, but in perfect unison, heads bobbed to
the side as the students traveled in the imaginary car and hit the
note. More giggles.</TE>
<TE>   "Did that work?" Short asked the class. Heads bobbed.</TE>
<TE>   Short doesn't want his students to mimic sounds, he said. "My job
is to help them create. Music is about creating."</TE>
<TE>   It is also about exploring. Not just musical horizons, but
geographic landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   Singing Trips Abroad</TE>
<TE>   Help Broaden Horizons</TE>
<TE>   Short helps his students expand beyond their world by sponsoring
singing trips abroad every four years, and to other parts of the
country every two years.</TE>
<TE>   His students have performed at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris and
in Belgium and London.</TE>
<TE>   His students pay what they can, and the rest comes from
fund-raisers that Short coordinates. This year, the class is going to
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Every student who works hard in his class and volunteers in
fund-raising efforts, such as selling tickets for their performances,
wins a spot on the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll guarantee you, you will go," Short told his students. "And I
haven't been made a liar yet."</TE>
<TE>   The Ardmore, Okla., native fell in love with choral music at 14,
he said, when he visited the First Southern Baptist Church in
Bakersfield, where he lived at the time.</TE>
<TE>   That led to a degree in vocal music education from Orange's
Chapman University in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Music fills his life. His wife, Vicki Sue, plays the piano, flute
and violin.</TE>
<TE>   His 11-year-old son, Matthew, plays violin and piano. His
daughter, Katherine, 14, is in Orange High's choir, band and dance
class.</TE>
<TE>   Short also directs Orange's Community Choir, which performs at
city's events, and the choir at his church, the First United
Methodist Church of Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "Multi-tasking, that's my life," Short said. "I don't know how it
all fits together, but it does."</TE>
<TE>   He is part teacher, part coach, part mentor and, his students say,
often part father.</TE>
<TE>   "He is just an awesome man," said senior Charity Greenway.</TE>
<TE>   And when students feel defeated, or struggle with a musical note,
straining to reach an unreachable pitch, Short reminds them:</TE>
<TE>   "It's only music. It is supposed to be uplifting."</TE>

<LD>The state attorney general's office will not file criminal charges
against an Orange County deputy prosecutor accused of using his
county computer to work on his political campaign, an official said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott Steiner was accused of using the office
computer last year for work related to his unsuccessful campaign for
the Orange City Council. State prosecutors investigated the
complaints so local prosecutors would avoid a conflict of interest.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Atty. Gen. James Dutton announced his decision in a letter
last week to Steiner and to Chuck Middleton, the county's chief
assistant prosecutor. Senior Assistant Atty. Gen. Gary Schons
declined to discuss the decision.</LD>

<LD>The Lincoln Club of Orange County has voted to oppose Measure W on

<LD>   The decision angered club members from South County, whose
residents favor Measure W by an overwhelming margin. It would replace
airport zoning at the closed El Toro Marine base with a park.</LD>
<LD>   The club, the county's most established Republican fund-raising
group, has been neutral on the question of an airport since 1994.</LD>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>All Spiezio Wants Is Opportunity to Play</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>If he would not go home encouraged, at least he would not go home
discouraged. In the final days of a frustrating season, before he
cleared out his locker for the winter, Scott Spiezio entered the
manager's office, shut the door and sat down.</LD>
<LD>   Spiezio was convinced that no matter what he did, the Angels never
would consider him an everyday player. He said it, Mike Scioscia read
it, and the manager summoned Spiezio for a little chat.</LD>
<LD>   "He said he knows I could play every day," Spiezio said. "He
didn't say I would."</LD>
<TE>   In those final days last season, the Angels moved Darin Erstad to
first base, as a possible alternative to playing Mo Vaughn there this
season. That prompted Spiezio to sound off. He outlasted Wally Joyner
and Larry Barnes for his chance at first base, hit .303 with 11 home
runs in 10 weeks as the starter there, and yet the Angels pondered
picking up an outfielder and shifting Erstad to first.</TE>
<TE>   With Vaughn gone to the New York Mets and Erstad remaining in
center, the path still is not clear for Spiezio. For now, he will
share the position with Shawn Wooten.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely room for one of those guys to come out and win
the job," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Spiezio: "It's good knowing I've got a good chance to play
more than last year."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio is superior defensively, but Wooten's forte is offense,
and that's what the Angels need most. The average American League
team got 29 home runs and 100 runs batted in from first basemen last
season; the Angels got 18 homers and 64 RBIs from theirs.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Wooten wins the job, Spiezio said he is enthusiastic about
playing for a contender and said he believes the acquisitions of
pitchers Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele and designated hitter Brad
Fullmer can propel the Angels toward October.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been to the playoffs," Spiezio said. "I'm sick of
watching them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As Cactus League games start this week, spring training stadiums
will implement security measures similar to those introduced at major
league stadiums after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. All bags will
be searched, and large bags, ice chests and coolers will not be
allowed.</TE>
<TE>   At Tempe Diablo Stadium, the Angels' spring home, the cheapest
seats in the house are $4 lawn seats, but fans will not be permitted
to bring lawn chairs into the stadium. Daily workouts on adjacent
fields remain free, and players remain available for autographs as
they walk across the parking lot separating the stadium from the
practice fields.</TE>

<HD>Arizona's Williams Breaks Leg in Practice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arizona Diamondback third baseman Matt Williams broke his left leg in
practice Monday in Tucson and is expected to miss the season opener.</LD>
<LD>   Williams was fielding ground balls on a side field at the Tucson
Electric Park complex when he rolled his ankle. Taken by ambulance to
the University Medical Center, he was found to have a fracture in his
left fibula--the long, thin outer bone of the lower leg--about six
inches above the ankle.</LD>
<LD>   Williams also dislocated his left ankle, damaging and stretching
ligaments, trainer Paul Lessard said.</LD>
<TE>   Williams, who missed 47 games last year with a hamstring injury
and was limited by injuries to 96 games in 2000, said he slipped in
the dirt and got his foot caught underneath his body.</TE>
<TE>   Such injuries typically take four to six weeks to heal; the World
Series champions open the season April 1 at home against San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Bonilla, who set the National League record for career home
runs by a switch-hitter and helped the Florida Marlins win the 1997
World Series, retired.</TE>
<TE>   A six-time All-Star during his 16 seasons, Bonilla turned 39
Saturday. Slowed by bad knees and other injuries, the
outfielder-infielder saw limited playing time in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Bonilla hit .213 with five homers and 21 runs batted in in 174
at-bats as a reserve for St. Louis last season.</TE>
<TE>   He finished his career with 287 home runs, 1,173 RBIs and a .279
average for eight teams, including the Dodgers. His 247 homers in the
NL are the most by a switch-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore Oriole pitcher Buddy Groom agreed to a two-year,
$6.25-million contract extension with a team option for 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Groom, 36, is getting $2.5 million this season. The new deal calls
for salaries of $3 million in 2003 and 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander led the Orioles last season with 70 appearances
and a career-high 11 saves. He was 1-4 with a 3.55 ERA and led
American League relievers with 1.23 walks per nine innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Raul Mondesi arrived at the Toronto Blue Jays' spring
camp in Dunedin, Fla., four days after the start of full-squad
workouts but one day before the mandatory reporting date.</TE>
<TE>   The former Dodger, who appeared to be in great shape, said he had
expected to be traded during the off-season and even wanted a trade.
"Everybody wanted me here so I changed my mind and I am ready to go,"
Mondesi said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankee first baseman Jason Giambi was scratched from an
intrasquad game in Tampa, Fla., because of left hamstring tightness.
It is not considered serious.</TE>

<LD>Ken Maguire of the Associated Press writes that Boston Red Sox fans
will go to great depths to break the Curse of the Bambino.</LD>
<LD>   "On Saturday, a group went to the bottom of a suburban Boston pond
in search of Babe Ruth's piano, which, the story goes, was tossed
into the water by the slugger in 1918.</LD>
<LD>   "The group hopes to refurbish the piano and play it again, just as
the Babe did in 1918, the last time the Red Sox won the World Series.
A season later, Ruth was sold to the New York Yankees, who have since
won 26 championships."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More piano: It hasn't been found yet, but organizers say they have
proof the piano is there. An infrared camera identified a rectangular
shape with wiry weeds at the bottom, 15 feet below the surface and
near shore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What former major leaguer grounded into only 33
double plays in 4,553 at-bats--the best in history with one for every
138 at-bats? Hint: He also played football for a local university.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The West way: Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News suggests
that the Golden State Warriors entice Jerry West out of retirement to
rebuild the floundering franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "West is the best at identifying, drafting and luring talent.
Jerry St. West.... He would do in the front office what Rick Barry
once did on the court. For the first time in a long, long time the
Lakers would glance uneasily at Northern California."</TE>
<TE>   Dream on, Skip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Required reading: A footnote to the story about the Canadian
writer who locked himself out of his Salt Lake City hotel room--in
the nude.</TE>
<TE>   "He covered himself with a newspaper," said Michael Ventre of
MSNBC.com. "This is a great argument for getting your news the
old-fashioned way instead of downloading it with one of those Palm
organizers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pest control: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Mystery to me: why the Japanese players in America seem to treat the
Japanese media like lepers. Ichiro Suzuki barely spoke to the legion
of Japanese scribes who followed him all last season....</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, we media are annoying, but those poor ink-stained Japanese
wretches are the players' link to their loyal fans back home."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's fiction now: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "John
Feinstein hasn't seen ESPN's movie 'A Season on the Brink,' which
will air March 10, but he read the script that was adapted from his
book about Bob Knight and hated it.</TE>
<TE>   "Aside from the factual inaccuracies, Feinstein told the Lubbock
Avalanche-Journal, the movie uses made-up characters, including a
halftime tirade that didn't happen, and has 'just the general feeling
that they went more for melodramatic screaming scenes.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Don Buford, who played for USC's baseball and
football teams in the late 1950s.</TE>

<TE>   And finally: Jerry Magee of the San Diego Union-Tribune,
commenting on Jon Gruden, Tampa Bay's new coach: "The man daily gets
up a few minutes after 3 in the morning during an NFL season in order
to begin his scheming.</TE>
<TE>   "Excuse me, but this doesn't impress me. The late Paul Brown, as
accomplished a coach as ever lived, did not work nights and neither

<LD>Tustin senior Michael Cavic plans to take the Southern Section boys'
swimming finals a lot more seriously this year. That's scary,
considering he won three section titles last spring and broke a
10-year-old Division III record in the process.</LD>
<LD>   But that was the unshaven, unrested Cavic, who used the postseason
as preparation to swim for Yugoslavia at the World Championships two
months later in Japan. He holds dual citizenship in the United States
and Yugoslavia.</LD>
<LD>   With no major international meets on his schedule this summer,
nothing stands in the way of an all-out performance at the finals in
May at Long Beach Belmont Plaza.</LD>
<TE>   Cavic said he wants to join Anthony Robinson as the only high
school swimmers to break 20 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle.
Robinson went 19.91 for Houston Memorial High in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Cavic also hopes to be the first swimmer to break 47 seconds in
the 100-yard butterfly in a high school event.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be easy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But those numbers are within reach for Cavic, who is 6 feet 5.</TE>
<TE>   He won the 50 freestyle at the section finals last spring in a
personal-best time of 20.21, missing the state high school record by
.04 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   He has already matched the national high school record of 47.10 in
the 100 butterfly, but didn't get his name in the record book because
the time was not produced at a high school meet.</TE>
<TE>   Because the 50 freestyle immediately follows the 100 butterfly at
the section finals, Cavic will look to break 20 seconds on the lead
leg of the 200 freestyle relay, which is scheduled about 20 minutes
after the 100 butterfly.</TE>
<TE>   For that to happen, Cavic will need help from his relay teammates
to advance the Tillers through the Golden West League finals and
section preliminaries.</TE>
<TE>   "If we qualify," Cavic said, "it would be the greatest gift they
could give me."</TE>
<TE>   After high school, Cavic hopes to stay competitive at least
through 2004. He competed for Yugoslavia at the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney and hopes to do the same in 2004 at Athens.</TE>
<TE>   Cavic said he would like to swim for the United States in 2008,
but would need to be released from the Yugoslavian team at least two
years before the Olympics. Depending on his success at the 2004
Games, permission could be difficult to obtain.</TE>
<TE>   "Yugoslavia doesn't have many Olympic swimmers," Cavic said. "If I
have success, I would be a hero to the country."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Cavic will compete collegiately for California
and continue working on a stroke that he hopes will help him be the
best.</TE>
<TE>   "I want people to see me in a race and say, 'OK, who is going to
win silver?'"</TE>
<TE>   Diving into it: Laguna Hills senior Michael Hilde is the favorite
to repeat as Division I diving champion. As a sophomore at Anaheim
Servite, Hilde set a Division II record that was broken last season
by Irvine University senior Louie Gagnet.</TE>
<TE>   Hilde transferred to Laguna Hills last year and beat Mission
Viejo's Dae Don Cho by 13.15 points to win Division I.</TE>

<LD>A look at the preseason top 10 boys' swim teams in the Southland:</LD>
<LD>   1. Newport Harbor (SS-Div. I)</LD>
<LD>   Sailors won't need to depend entirely on Olympic silver medalist
Aaron Peirsol, who won Division I titles in the 200 freestyle and 100
backstroke last season. They also return three swimmers from
division-winning 400 freestyle relay team.</LD>
<TE>   2. Irvine (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Graduation took its toll on the two-time defending Division I
champions, who lost their entire 200- and 400-freestyle relay teams
that took second in Division I finals, but the Vaqueros will still
contend.</TE>
<TE>   3. San Clemente (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   The Tritons have a strong junior class, led by Kenny Yamamoto, who
finished second in the 200 individual medley at Division I finals and
helped the 200 medley relay team finish seventh.</TE>
<TE>   4. Santa Margarita (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Matt Sabatasso and Cutberto Hernandez return from a 200 medley
relay team that finished second in Division I. Douglas Ciolli also
finished fifth in the 50 freestyle and helped the Eagles' 400
freestyle relay team place third.</TE>
<TE>   5. Santa Barbara (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Williamson, Cleve Motley and Tyler Wilson return from a 200
freestyle relay team that finished fifth in Division I. Williamson
finished fourth in the 100 breaststroke.</TE>
<TE>   6. Anaheim Canyon (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Juniors Colby Schlaht and Simon Long will be counted on to boost a
200 medley relay team that finished fourth in Division I.</TE>
<TE>   7. Servite (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Adam Hewko is the reigning Division I champion in the 500
freestyle and the sophomore also finished fifth in the 200 freestyle,
the second-fastest returning swimmer behind Peirsol.</TE>
<TE>   8. Mission Viejo (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Senior Alejandro Jacobo is the top returning Division I
breaststroker, finishing second last season to Redlands' Evan Castro,
the only swimmer from outside Orange County to win a Division I
title.</TE>
<TE>   9. Riverside Poly (SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   Juniors Mike Looy and Jason Lyons were part of winning 200 and 400
freestyle relay teams at Division II finals last season, helping Poly
to a second-place finish.</TE>
<TE>   10. Damien (SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   Casey Jarvis is the lone returning member of a 200 medley relay
team that won the Division II title and helped the Spartans win the
championship.</TE>

<HD>Carson May Draw NFL</HD>
<DH>Facilities: Sports complex that breaks ground today could
become training camp for San Diego Chargers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sprawling $120-million sports complex planned for Cal State
Dominguez Hills not only will be an epicenter for soccer and tennis
but probably the summer home to the San Diego Chargers.</LD>
<LD>   Anschutz Entertainment Group will break ground today on the Carson
project, which could be the first step in the NFL's return to Los
Angeles. The Chargers are strongly considering relocating their
training camp from UC San Diego to the AEG complex beginning in the
summer of 2003, the estimated completion date for the facility.</LD>
<LD>   "We're definitely interested," Charger President Dean Spanos said
Monday. "We're going down that path. It clearly stands out by far
over all the other sites we've looked at."</LD>
<TE>   The complex will be the latest gem in the growing sports empire of
Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz, who owns Staples Center and all
or part of 17 sports franchises, including the Kings. He also owns
the L.A. Galaxy--one of his five Major League Soccer teams--which
will call the complex home.</TE>
<TE>   Spanos was quick to clarify that relocating training camp does not
translate into moving the team's permanent home, merely that removing
players from familiar surroundings allows them to better concentrate
on football for three weeks every summer.</TE>
<TE>   While pointing out football is an ancillary focus of the complex,
AEG President Tim Leiweke said the 85-acre facility will feature all
the necessities--and more--for interested NFL franchises, including
fields, office space, weight rooms, health facilities, accommodations
and room for 10,000 spectators.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be able to do all of that," Leiweke said. "Clearly, our
hope is at some point down the road--separate from the training
center--that an NFL team returns to L.A. It's in the best interest of
our city and the best interest of the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   The primary tenants of the facility will be the Galaxy; the United
States Soccer Federation, which will make it a permanent training
home for its men's and women's national teams; and the Pete Sampras
Tennis Academy.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of the facility will be a figure-8 featuring a
27,000-seat soccer stadium at one end and a 13,000-seat tennis
stadium at the other. Located between the stadiums will be a
two-level support building featuring amenities to be shared by both
stadiums, including 10 locker rooms, weight and training rooms,
coaching offices and player lounges.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the stadiums, the complex will include:</TE>
<TE>   * Seven soccer training fields.</TE>
<TE>   * Thirty tennis courts, 18 of which will be newly constructed.</TE>
<TE>   * A 6,000-seat track and field venue that expands to 15,000 seats
and could potentially serve as the permanent home to USA Track and
Field.</TE>
<TE>   * A relocation and upgrade of an existing velodrome, inline
roller-hockey rink, and baseball and softball fields.</TE>
<TE>   * A three-mile jogging trail with a dozen fitness stations around
the perimeter of the complex.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the second stadium in the country created exclusively
for soccer; the other is the home stadium of MLS' Columbus (Ohio)
Crew. The AEG version will cost twice as much, Leiweke said, and will
feature a roof over the stands that enhances the intimacy and
contributes to the fan experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It will move soccer ahead in this country light years," said
Leiweke, also president of Staples Center. "For the first time ever,
there will be a stadium built in this country that will be comparable
to some of the great soccer stadiums in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   With the development of the U.S. Soccer National Training Center,
games will take place at the facility throughout the year and will
involve as many as 10 national soccer team programs for top-flight
players of all ages.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said the creation of the tennis complex could help shift
the balance of power in the sport from Florida to Southern
California, and attract more world-class events and tournaments to
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the U.S. Tennis Assn. have discussed moving their
training-center headquarters from Key Biscayne, Fla., to L.A., or
possibly establishing a location in each. USTA officials Arlen
Kantarian and Paul Annacone met here last week with AEG regarding the
tennis center and other opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "The USTA thinks this is a great opportunity for the sport," said
Kantarian, the organization's chief executive of professional tennis.
"This is a significant commitment and great news for tennis. We
support their vision, and we look forward to further discussions as
to what might take place in L.A."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Back on Track</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: They outclass Grizzlies in 90-77 victory.
Brand gets 27 points, 23 rebounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>The Clippers desperately need more games like this one, a
comprehensive victory over the woebegone Memphis Grizzlies, a team
they figured to defeat going in. After all, if there's a team
experiencing more pain and suffering than the Clippers, it's the
luckless Grizzlies.</LD>
<LD>   Memphis went into Monday's 90-77 loss to the Clippers before an
announced crowd of 11,878 at the Pyramid with seven players injured
or suspended and out of the lineup.</LD>
<LD>   A guy named Eddie Gill directed the Grizzlies in the absence of
point guards Jason Williams, who did not play because of toe trouble,
and Brevin Knight (sprained ankle). Gill, signed to a 10-day contract
Saturday, responded with 20 points.</LD>
<TE>   The Grizzlies also were without Michael Dickerson, who has a
stress fracture near his groin. Isaac Austin has a sore knee, Nick
Anderson a sprained wrist and Grant Long a groin strain. And Rodney
Buford is serving a drug suspension.</TE>
<TE>   All of which led to Clipper power forward Elton Brand recording
his 38th double-double.... by the end of the first quarter. Actually,
if you want to be specific, it took Brand only 10 minutes 29 seconds
before he scored 10 points and took 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Brand would finish with 27 points and a career-best 23 rebounds,
his second 20-20 effort in as many games and the third of his career.
He had 23 points and 21 rebounds in Saturday's loss to the Indiana
Pacers, and Monday became the first player in Clipper history to
score 20 or more points and take 20 or more rebounds in consecutive
games.</TE>
<TE>   "Elton was a monster down low," Memphis Coach Sidney Lowe said.
"He was too tough down there. We couldn't stop him."</TE>
<TE>   The Grizzlies tried to thwart Brand, but with only eight healthy
bodies, it was a mismatch from start to finish.</TE>
<TE>   Or it would have been if the Clippers hadn't lost almost all of a
double-digit lead in the third quarter. But unlike their last trip to
Memphis, when the Clippers squandered a 14-point lead en route to an
overtime loss Jan. 28, they drew strength from Brand during crunch
time Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite playing with a stretched tendon in his right ring finger,
Brand made five of six shots in the second half and one of two free
throws for 11 points. He also had 10 rebounds, including eight on the
defensive end.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Jeff McInnis helped keep the Clippers afloat, scoring
16 of his 19 points in the second half. With the Clippers ahead,
68-62, McInnis made three free throws to start the fourth quarter and
gave them breathing room. Memphis never got closer than 75-68 after
rookie forward Pau Gasol's layup with 5:08 left.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis also captured the essence of the Clippers' second victory
in four games on this five-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an ugly, scrappy, crazy game, but it was a win," he said.
"We needed that. We want to get to the playoffs. That's our main
goal. We've got to concentrate on getting more wins like this one."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, defeating the Grizzlies was expected, but the Clippers
have miles to fly before they rest.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's game against the Rockets at Houston will be the
Clippers' 21st on the road in their last 30 games.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody else is losing--not Seattle or Portland or Phoenix--so we
can't lose either," Brand said. "We've got to get back into the
race."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the Clippers are 28-30 and hoping to recapture the
early-season momentum they built while playing almost exclusively at
home before Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers vaulted over the Phoenix Suns by percentage points
into ninth place and trail the eighth-place Seattle SuperSonics by
three games.</TE>
<TE>   Only eight Western Conference teams advance to the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   But wait, there's more.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers play four of their next five on the road. They return
from this trip to face the Golden State Warriors on Saturday at
Staples Center, then hit the road again to play Milwaukee, Chicago,
Cleveland and Minnesota.</TE>

<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>The hits keep coming for the Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   Center Michael Olowokandi suffered a slight sprain of the
posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee Monday against the
Memphis Grizzlies. He will sit out tonight's game against the Houston
Rockets and will be examined further when the team returns home
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Alvin Gentry had no immediate plan to replace Olowokandi for
the short term. "I have no idea," he said. "I haven't even thought
about it."</LD>
<TE>   Olowokandi had four points and six rebounds in 22 minutes Monday,
leaving after a Memphis player ran into his knee as he attempted a
third-quarter shot. He said he expects to undergo an MRI exam later
this week.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way it goes," Olowokandi said. "I've played four
seasons without an injury, but we'll see."</TE>
<TE>   Sean Rooks replaced Olowokandi down the stretch, making two key
jump shots early in the fourth quarter. It's possible Rooks could be
Olowokandi's replacement tonight. Gentry also could play power
forward Elton Brand at center.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are already without small forwards Lamar Odom, who
has a sprained right wrist and ankle, and Corey Maggette (dislocated
fingers and a mild concussion).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As promised, Gentry started rookie Tremaine Fowlkes at small
forward and brought Darius Miles into the game as a reserve.</TE>

<TE>   Update--Houston guard Steve Francis is the only player to lead his
team in points (an average of 21.8), rebounding (7.6) and assists
(6.6). Francis had 11 points, nine rebounds and eight assists
Saturday against the Boston Celtics, the Rockets' second consecutive
victory.</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard,
observed, worn, viewed, dialed or downloaded, it's in play here.</LD>
<LD>   What: Los Angeles Sports and Fitness Magazine/Los Angeles Marathon
program.</LD>
<LD>   The official program for the 17th Los Angeles Marathon is a
16-page supplement to the three-issue-old magazine LAS&amp;F, Los Angeles
Sports and Fitness Magazine. Publisher Danny Greenberg, the former
senior vice president of Foxsports.com, started the magazine because
he said there was, "Nothing that serves just Los Angeles. There was
nothing talking to this community."</LD>
<TE>   LAS&amp;F distinguishes itself from other fitness magazines in several
ways: Each issue is theme-oriented and it's free. LAS&amp;F isn't
available at newsstands, but the bi-monthly magazine can be found at
more than 400 Los Angeles retail locations, including health clubs,
sporting goods stores, restaurants, bookstores and libraries.</TE>
<TE>   The guide to Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon and the Quality of Life
Expo--which runs Thursday-Saturday at the Los Angeles Convention
Center--includes a list of 400 exhibitors, entertainers, a detailed
map of the new course, past winners, and capsules on some runners to
watch. There's also a short on 78-year-old marathoner Milton T.
Bassett and an item about Brian Gillespie and fiancee Maureen, who
met at Mile 6 during the 1998 race. They will be married at that spot
during this year's race. There is also a look at the race's "Legacy
Runners", 317 people who have run in all 16 marathons.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're doing is pretty well defined," said Greenberg, a
former television producer at CNN. "We're not going to be doing a lot
of skiing and surfing. We're mostly a running magazine and we'll
cover some adventure racing. We want to hone in on the everyday
runner, not just the elite athlete."</TE>
<TE>   The current issue includes a compelling feature on 39-year
Calabasas resident Shannon Farar-Griefer, the first woman to double
the Badwater 135-mile ultra-marathon. Last summer, she ran 292 miles
in 71/2 days, completing a climb to the summit of Mount Whitney
between the two 135-mile runs that go through Death Valley. Editor
Jason Johnson--who also served a stint at Foxsports.com--is the only
other full-time editorial employee on staff of the magazine, which
relies heavily on contributing writers.</TE>
<TE>   The last page of the magazine is dubbed the "Hollywood Ending,"
featuring an interview with a celebrity. Star-power is definitely
lacking, and so are the tough questions.</TE>
<TE>   In the debut edition, E! Entertainment's "Wild On" host Brooke
Burke was asked questions including, "At what age did you begin to
take exercising seriously and why?"</TE>
<TE>   The current issue features morning deejay Danny Bonaduce of
"Partridge Family" fame.</TE>

<HD>Lo Duca Is Rewarded With Three-Year, $7-Million Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers have reached an agreement with catcher Paul Lo Duca on a
three-year contract that is believed to be worth about $7 million. An
official announcement is expected today or Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   After spending almost eight years in the minor leagues, Lo Duca,
28, had a breakthrough season in 2001, batting .320 with 25 home runs
and 90 runs batted in while playing four positions (catcher, first
base, left field, right field) and hitting in six different spots in
the order.</LD>
<LD>   The deal rewards Lo Duca for his outstanding 2001 season and
provides some cost certainty for the Dodgers, who will avoid the
arbitration process with Lo Duca in 2003 and 2004. Lo Duca can't
become a free agent until 2005.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are attempting to sign reliever Matt Herges to a
multi-year contract, but the sides are still far apart on a two-year
deal.... The club has decided not to bid for South Korean reliever
Jin Pil-Jung. Major league teams have until 2 p.m. today to submit
offers to the commissioner's office for Jung. The amount of the
highest bid--he could go for as much as $1.5 million--will be
forwarded to Jung's Korean League team, and the high bidder will have
30 days to negotiate a contract.... Dodger ace Kevin Brown,
recovering from elbow surgery, threw 50 pitches off the mound again
Monday, and pitching Coach Jim Colborn said he should be ready to
start a game in the second week of the exhibition season. Manager Jim
Tracy believes that will give Brown enough preparation time to pitch
the season opener against San Francisco on April 2.</TE>

<HD>Success at Top Will Be Bottom Line for Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Team will need increased production from first
two hitters in lineup, along with better baserunning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Even if the addition of Brian Jordan and the return of a healthy Eric
Karros and Adrian Beltre make up for the loss of slugger Gary
Sheffield, the Dodgers, who scored the fewest runs of any National
League West team last season, still have plenty of room to improve
offensively.</LD>
<LD>   That's why Manager Jim Tracy and his coaches have put a high
priority this spring on aggressive baserunning--going from first to
third on singles, advancing on balls in the dirt, bunting, scoring
runners from third with less than two outs, and hitting behind
runners.</LD>
<LD>   "Our hope is to take the little parts of the game, some of the
intangibles, to another level," Tracy said. "We want to incorporate
situational hitting with aggressive baserunning, and if that turns
the table for us in 10 games, it can make one heck of a difference.</LD>
<TE>   "We were not very good at that last year, so we're changing the
way we think about it and talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy has told his players to use the exhibition season as a trial
run, to not be concerned with making mistakes or getting thrown out
on the basepaths, and the Dodgers, who were 29-29 in one-run games
last season, seem to have embraced the approach.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to sit back and wait to explode," second baseman
Mark Grudzielanek said. "If we did things last year like we're trying
to do this year, we would have been a better team. We were really
weak at that last year, and it showed."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan is more athletic and runs better than Sheffield, who had 36
home runs and 100 runs batted in last season but was traded to
Atlanta in January. Beltre should be more of a threat on the
basepaths now that he has recovered from last year's surgery to close
a wound in his right lower abdomen after a botched appendectomy in
the Dominican Republic. Speedy Cesar Izturis could replace Alex Cora
at shortstop. So, it appears the Dodgers have more team speed than
last season.</TE>
<TE>   But the key to a more productive offense is at the top of the
batting order. Dodger leadoff hitters combined for a .306 on-base
percentage last season, 15th out of 16 NL teams, and that includes 44
games by the highly successful Paul Lo Duca in the top spot. No. 2
batters combined for a .320 on-base percentage.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek, the primary No. 2 hitter, must improve his .317
on-base percentage, and whoever leads off--Tracy on Monday couldn't
even name a leadoff batter for Thursday's Grapefruit League
opener--will have to do a much better job of setting the table than
the platoon of Tom Goodwin and Marquis Grissom did last season.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin hit .231 and had a .286 on-base percentage, and Grissom
hit .221 with a .250 on-base percentage. Grissom had 21 homers and 60
RBIs, but he also had 107 strikeouts and only 16 walks.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, the 34-year-old veteran, said he's too deep into his
career to change his offensive approach. Though he's willing to bat
leadoff, he believes looking for more walks will affect his
aggressiveness and confidence at the plate, and that would hurt his
productivity.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin knows he needs to improve his bunting and on-base
percentage, but he said he's "not going to worry" about molding
himself into the prototypical leadoff batter, a player who works
counts and gets on base any way he can.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year I was thinking too much instead of coming out and
playing the way I can," Goodwin said. "If that's not good enough,
we'll go our separate ways."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the combined $8.25 million the Dodgers owe Grissom and
Goodwin this season, one or both could be released before the season,
especially if McKay Christensen, who showed promise in 28 games last
season (.327 average, .400 on-base percentage), proves he can handle
center field and the leadoff spot this spring. Dave Roberts, acquired
from Cleveland in a winter trade, is also competing for the
center-field and leadoff spots.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been well-chronicled what is necessary at the top of our
lineup; we need people to get on base, and if they can take a walk,
do it," Tracy said. "I'm not advocating that our leadoff batter stand
there and take good pitches, but we have to improve our on-base
percentage at the top of the order.</TE>
<TE>   "On most good clubs there is some type of catalyst. Whether that's
an average hitter who gets a lot of walks, a lot of bunt hits or
ground-ball hits, it doesn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Just go out there and be a threat."</TE>

<HD>McDonald Getting His Break</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How far Mighty Duck center Andy McDonald has come in a year can been
judged by two goals ... his first one and his latest one.</LD>
<LD>   McDonald scored his first NHL goal against the Kings on Dec. 3,
2000. He proceeded to take a tumble behind the net.</LD>
<LD>   Unsure footing.</LD>
<TE>   McDonald scored his most recent goal leading a two-on-one break,
giving the Ducks a 3-2 victory over the Calgary Flames two weeks ago.
He merely stood like a statue by the goal post.</TE>
<TE>   Steady, confident.</TE>
<TE>   That is what McDonald has become, given the chance. He takes a
seven-game point streak--the longest by a Duck this season--into the
post-Olympic stretch run.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald has been one of the few bright spots in another Duck
season on the blink. He centers the Ducks' top line and ranks sixth
in scoring among NHL rookies despite having played only about half
the games. He has six goals and 25 points in 35 games and is the
hottest rookie in the league this side of Atlanta's Ilya Kovalchuk.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone develops at their own pace, but in less than a year, he
is making confident plays," said left wing Mike Leclerc, who skates
on the line with McDonald. "Obviously, he's a gifted playmaker and is
crafty with the puck. He always makes the smart play. He finds the
open guy or gets in the right spot."</TE>
<TE>   It has taken time for the Ducks to figure out the right spot for
McDonald. Their scouting department has recommended drafting players
like Jonas Ronnqvist and Timo Parssinen--both stuck at minor league
Cincinnati--and McDonald was an after-thought, signing as a free
agent in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks weren't alone. No one wanted McDonald even though he was
a Hobey Baker award finalist at Colgate. Scouts were put off by his
size, generously listed at 5 feet 10, 186 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   This was a familiar fight for McDonald. He had an impressive
training camp. Still, he was shipped back to Cincinnati. He was
recalled to stay Dec. 2 and has thrived on the first line playing
with Paul Kariya.</TE>
<TE>   "I was guilty as anyone," Duck Coach Bryan Murray said. "I didn't
think we needed another small player. But Andy does a good job of
positioning himself so he doesn't get knocked off the puck.</TE>
<TE>   "He has proven he belongs in this league."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   McDonald has proven his worth so much that Murray will leave him
on the top line against Minnesota on Wednesday even though center
Steve Rucchin returns to the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin, the Ducks' top center the rare times he has been healthy
the past two seasons, has missed 44 games because of a stress
fracture in his left ankle. He underwent surgery to have screws
placed in the ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Murray said that Rucchin would likely skate with left wing Jeff
Friesen and right wing Marty McInnis.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin left Monday's practice early because of soreness in his
ankle. But he said he would play Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Controversy Accompanies Diamond Ranch's Miracle</HD>

<LD>Miracle finishes don't come along very often, but Pomona Diamond
Ranch can  thank just such a finish  for getting it into the Southern
Section Division III-AA semifinals for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   After falling behind, 51-50, on a three-point basket by La Puente
Bishop Amat's Jessica Carrera with less than a second left in the
quarterfinal game on Wednesday, Diamond Ranch experienced  the finish
of the season.</LD>
<LD>   With 0.8 seconds left on the game clock and the ball being
inbounded from the other end of the court,  Diamond Ranch's Alysha
White caught an inbounds pass near the three-point line, dribbled
twice toward midcourt and launched a  shot. She made the basket for a
53-51 victory, setting off a wild celebration  in front of the
hometown fans and some disbelieving Bishop Amat coaches and players.</LD>
<TE>   The videotape replay, viewed by The Times, showed that from the
time of White's first touch to the time the buzzer sounded was no
less than 1.6 seconds--at that point the ball was about hip-high--and
no less than 1.7 seconds until the time she released the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Although the tape does not conclusively show one of the two
officials waving off the basket, as contended by Bishop Amat Coach
Richard Wiard, it does show a second referee walking to center court
and, 6.5 seconds after the ball went off the backboard and through
the hoop, signaling that the basket counted.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, after receiving conflicting information about who
won the game, the Southern Section office spoke to both officials,
who agreed the basket was good.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is very confident with the decision, the officials and,
by extension, the CIF Southern Section office," said section
spokesman Thom Simmons. "By CIF rules, in the playoffs, we can't
review the videotape."</TE>
<TE>   Wiard, who admitted that Diamond Ranch outplayed his second-seeded
team, said, "My frustration is that the adults had an opportunity to
make it right. We try to teach the kids to do the right thing, even
when it's unpopular and hurts."</TE>
<TE>   At least Wiard maintained some perspective. "I told my kids there
are far greater tragedies in the world than losing a high school
basketball game."</TE>
<TE>   Apple Valley defeated Diamond Ranch in the semifinals on Saturday,
60-35.</TE>
<TE>   She owns Brea: Krissy Duperron, the coach at North Torrance, did
something Saturday in her first season of coaching that her father
and predecessor, Gary, never did in his seven seasons.</TE>
<TE>   She beat Brea Olinda.</TE>
<TE>   Duperron, a 1997 graduate of Irvine Woodbridge, was on Warrior
teams that twice defeated Brea in the Southern California Regional
finals. She has never lost to Brea.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really lucky in high school playing for [Eric] Bangs and
the team we had there, and I have a great opportunity to coach the
team I have here," Duperron said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Julia Pitts may be North's star, Staci Kaneshiro's
three-point basket with four minutes remaining put the Saxons ahead
to stay. Traci Elliott then made six free throws and Danielle Pitman
made a steal with 14 seconds left in the 43-40 Division II-A
semifinal victory.</TE>
<TE>   It's the first time Brea has not appeared in a Southern Section
championship game since 1988, a span of 13 years that included 12
section titles.</TE>
<TE>   Overwhelmed: Alhambra Keppel had one of the best records in the
Southern Section at 24-3, but after its 66-57  loss to Ventura in a
quarterfinal, Coach Richard Marquis would have traded a few victories
for a few tougher opponents on the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not veterans of this type of competition by any means,"
Marquis said of his team, which had gone nearly two months without
playing a formidable playoff-caliber opponent. "The kids didn't lack
effort, but lacked tough game experience."</TE>
<TE>   Keppel was trying to  reach the semifinals for the first time in
school history.</TE>
<TE>   Staying alive: Orange Lutheran and Santa Ana Calvary Chapel
completed their last seasons in the Olympic League and will join
public school leagues in 2002-03.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Lutheran faces top-seeded Playa del Rey St. Bernard tonight
in a Division IV-AA semifinal. In the other semifinal, Calvary Chapel
plays Santa Fe Springs St. Paul.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adrienne Binder specializes in long-distance freestyle
swimming--those races that stretch far beyond any she can compete in
for Santa Barbara San Marcos High.</LD>
<LD>   At the Goodwill Games, she won a bronze medal for the United
States in the 800 freestyle last summer in Australia.</LD>
<LD>   In the 500 freestyle--the longest event at the high-school
level--Binder has finished second in the Southern Section Division I
finals the last two seasons to Olympian Kaitlin Sandeno of Lake
Forest El Toro.</LD>
<TE>   With Sandeno now swimming for USC, Binder appears ready to carve a
wake of her own through the Southland's high school competition,
though she may find herself racing uncontested for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good experience racing with [Sandeno] the last two
seasons," Binder said. "I'll kind of miss it this year."</TE>
<TE>   But Binder remains motivated by the time standards set by Sandeno.
Binder's second-place time of 4 minutes 44.04 seconds last season was
more than three seconds faster than Sandeno's winning time at the
2000 finals.</TE>
<TE>   Binder aims at surpassing Sandeno's Division I record time of
4:39.64, set at the section finals last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to do it as soon as possible," said Binder, who is
confident in her ability to push herself. She will have to. The
next-fastest swimmer at last year's finals was 11 seconds behind
Binder.</TE>
<TE>   Binder also finished fourth in the 200-yard individual medley at
the section finals the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   She had the race of her life at the Goodwill Games, where she
stayed with eventual winner Yana Klochkova of the Ukraine for the
first 700 meters before tiring from the brisk pace set by the
two-time gold medalist at the 2000 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the most amazing experience I've had," Binder said. "I'd
never been on an international trip before and never been part of a
U.S. team."</TE>
<TE>   Although Binder competed at the 2000 Olympic trials in
Indianapolis, she didn't finish better than 20th in any event. But
the experience will come in handy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shooting for 2004," said Binder, who turns 17 next month.
"The 2000 trials gave me a feel for what it's like."</TE>
<TE>   Binder's results at the national level include a second-place
finish in the 800 freestyle at the 2001 Phillips 66 Summer Nationals,
along with a fourth in the 1,500 freestyle and a seventh in the 400
individual medley. At the 2001 Spring Nationals, she was third in the
1,500 freestyle and fifth in the 800 freestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 18 months, Binder plans to increase her training
distances weekly, but for now is more interested in the quality of
her workouts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't do that much yardage compared to other distance
swimmers," she said. "I try to do more [individual medley] work.
Rather than do a freestyle set that's real long, I do smaller sets
that take more thinking and more focus on my strokes."</TE>
<TE>   Different strokes: The Century League grew even more competitive
in the off-season when Ashley DePaul transferred to Villa Park from
Corona Centennial. DePaul, a junior, has won three section Division
III titles in the last two years. She won back-to-back titles in the
200 individual medley and was first in the 100 butterfly last season.
The league already features a strong Anaheim Canyon team led by
senior Erin Volcan, the defending Division I champion in the 200
freestyle.... DePaul will be hard-pressed to win a Division I title
in the 200 individual medley. The defending champion is San Clemente
senior Kristen Caverly, who just missed setting a national high
school record in the event at the section finals last spring.... The
early diving favorite is Ventura Buena junior Leanne Dumais, who
finished third at the section finals the last two seasons behind
graduates Allison Brennan of Huntington Beach Edison and Tiffany
Manning of Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley. Dumais is the sister of
former Southern Section champions Justin, Troy and Brice Dumais.</TE>

<HD>Down the Stretch</HD>
<DH>With Their Coach Sidelined Indefinitely and a Contentious
Battle for a Playoff Spot Looming, the Kings Face Some Serious
Challenges ...</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE and LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>About to embark on a 24-game post-Olympic stretch run they hope will
land them in the playoffs, the Kings learned Monday that they will be
without their coach indefinitely.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Murray, suffering from post-concussion syndrome after a
single-vehicle accident Feb. 15 in Wisconsin, will continue his
recuperation at home in Faribault, Minn., while assistant coach Dave
Tippett takes control of the team on an interim basis starting with
tonight's game against the Columbus Blue Jackets.</LD>
<LD>   With the NHL resuming its season after a 12-day break for the
Olympics, it's an uncertain time for every team, but none more than
the Kings, who are expected to be without Murray at least through
Wednesday night's trip finale against the Pittsburgh Penguins, and
possibly longer.</LD>
<TE>   "It's one of those things where we've been thinking about it for a
couple of days now," Tippett said. "As a backup plan, we've all been
preparing as if he wasn't going to be with us for the trip. The
players understand what is going on."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a concussion, Murray suffered four broken ribs, a
separated left shoulder, a broken left wrist and numerous cuts and
scrapes after the truck he was driving skidded off an icy patch of
Interstate 90 outside Sparta, Wis. He is scheduled to see a
neurologist today at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think I'd be ready to be in Pittsburgh," the coach
said Monday night from Faribault, "but I doubt that very much."</TE>
<TE>   Tippett, a former NHL player who has interviewed for several NHL
coaching vacancies in recent years, most recently with the Mighty
Ducks last summer, will make his NHL coaching debut against the Blue
Jackets, who in 2000 considered making him their first coach before
turning instead to Dave King.</TE>
<TE>   A two-time Canadian Olympian--he was captain of the 1984 team and
earned a silver medal in 1992--Tippett, 41, played 11 seasons as a
forward in the NHL with the Hartford Whalers, Washington Capitals,
Philadelphia Flyers and Penguins, accumulating 93 goals and 169
assists in 721 games.</TE>
<TE>   He ended his playing career in 1995 as a player-assistant coach
with the Houston Aeros of the International Hockey League and in 1999
led the Aeros to the Turner Cup championship as general manager and
coach, earning IHL coach-of-the-year honors. His record in three
seasons with the Aeros was 165-85.</TE>
<TE>   He is in his third season with the Kings, as are fellow assistants
Mark Hardy and Ray Bennett, all of whom were hired by Murray. Tippett
said he plans to draw on all that experience come game time.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty much going to keep things the same. Mark Hardy will
continue to coach the penalty kill and I will coach the power play.
In that respect, it will remain status quo," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] there's always little things that happen during a game that
you have to go with your gut feeling," he later added. "Sometimes,
you just have a feeling about certain players, who can do certain
things. But I will stay with the basics."</TE>
<TE>   There will be some changes, however. Tippett said he will handle
forward line changes--normally Murray's job--while Hardy will oversee
defense.</TE>
<TE>   King defenseman Mathieu Schneider said Tippett has the players'
support.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone here trusts Dave Tippett," Schneider said. "He's a
tremendous coach. He's going to be a great head coach in this league
one day. Guys are going to play just as hard for him as they would
for Andy.... Obviously, we're all concerned and hope Andy gets back
as soon as possible. But at the same time, he'd be the first to say
that we've got to go along with business as usual, and that's what we
intend to do."</TE>
<TE>   For the Kings and Murray, though, it's anything but business as
usual.</TE>
<TE>   "The circumstances are certainly intriguing to put it mildly,"
Tippett said. "But we've had four good practices and the players are
very upbeat. They're ready to play."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings broke for the Olympics after turning their season around
with a 19-6-4-1 run that took them from a season-worst six games
below .500 on the morning of Dec. 9 to a season-high seven games
above .500 at the break.</TE>
<TE>   In the tightly bunched Western Conference playoff race, they are
only five points out of first place in the Pacific Division but also
barely clinging to a playoff slot, three points ahead of the
10th-place Phoenix Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   And their coach, lucky to be alive after his truck crashed through
a wire fence and rolled several times down an embankment, is in no
shape to lead them.</TE>
<TE>   Though he had vowed to return to the Kings in time for the
resumption of practice last Thursday, Murray suffered a setback in
his recuperation overnight Tuesday and has experienced severe
headaches and vomiting on and off ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly lingering longer than what we'd hoped for," he
said, "but everybody tells me that it's pretty normal in a situation
like this and that I was always maybe a little too on the optimistic
side....</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe that's part of the excitement of coming through an accident
and thinking you got through it pretty good. You don't realize the
toll that it really took on your body. The body gets thrown around as
violently as it did--this is what the doctors are telling me--it's
normal that there are going to be some aftereffects. You've just got
to take care of them and deal with them as they come up."</TE>
<TE>   The coach was not ready to predict when he might return.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be back just as soon as I can," he said. "But I've also got
to recognize the difference between what's good for one's life
and--the other thing's a sport....</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to be smart enough to know what's the right thing to do
here for myself and for the Kings. And the team's been very
supportive about it. They know it's tough for me to miss a meeting,
let alone a practice or a game.</TE>
<TE>   "Watching the game tomorrow night is going to be tough, but I've
got to take care of myself and make sure I do what's right."</TE>

<HD>Jackson Tests His Players</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>On most teams, if the coach tells his players he wants them to take a
written test, they brush up on the pick-and-roll, zone defenses and
the fine points of an in-bounds play.</LD>
<LD>   But the Lakers are not most teams and Phil Jackson is not like
most coaches.</LD>
<LD>   So it is not surprising that the written exam he has required all
his players to take has more to do with the game of life than the
game of basketball.</LD>
<TE>   It includes the social atom in which the player is asked to put
himself at the center of the Laker universe and then draw in where
all the players are in relation to him.</TE>
<TE>   There are questions such as what is your greatest fear, what is
most important to you, how would you change yourself if you could,
what is your least favorite physical characteristic and who are your
favorite authors.</TE>
<TE>   With the exams completed, Jackson has begun to meet individually
with the players to go over the answers. Each meeting lasts between
60 and 90 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's cool," forward Mark Madsen said. "In so many cases,
you have a coach and you never really get to know each other. It's
great that he is taking the time."</TE>
<TE>   Although the players are supposed to keep their answers
confidential, Madsen, a Stanford graduate with an economics degree,
revealed that his favorite authors are Fyodor Dostoevsky and John
Steinbeck.</TE>
<TE>   Now there's a pair of names rarely mentioned around the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant has a slightly sprained left thumb which is not
expected to affect his playing time in tonight's game against the
Milwaukee Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   It is believed Bryant, who had the thumb bandaged for practice
Monday, was injured in Sunday's game against the New York Knicks when
Latrell Sprewell reached in on a steal attempt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The secret is finally out. Now we know why Shaquille O'Neal has a
sore big toe on his right foot.</TE>
<TE>   He inadvertently brought two left shoes with him on this trip.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Milwaukee, 5 PST</TE>
<TE>   Channel 9, TBS</TE>
<TE>   Site--Bradley Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 38-16, Bucks 32-22.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Bucks--1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Bucks may be leading the Central Division, but in the
NBA, even winning doesn't guarantee harmony. Forward Glenn Robinson
is so furious with his coach that he says he wants out of Milwaukee
if George Karl continues to use him as he did last Friday. Robinson
played 25 minutes, but sat out the last 6:46, because, Karl said, he
liked the way the five he had on the floor were performing.</TE>

<HD>Plenty to Play for, Say Ducks</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Despite long odds on making playoffs, players
insist they won't pack it in, although question of how to improve the
team festers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The apex to their season has come and gone.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Kariya won a gold medal with Team Canada at the Salt Lake
City Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Oleg Tverdovsky picked up a bronze playing with Russia.</LD>
<TE>   Ruslan Salei and his teammates reached national hero status
getting Belarus into the semifinals at the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it doesn't seem fair, but their reward is to return to the
day-in, day-out drudgery of playing for the Mighty Ducks, an NHL team
that has the Olympic medal equivalency of tin.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly the silver chalice, the Stanley Cup, is well out of
their reach. Even to qualify as the No. 8 playoff team and be
first-round fodder for the Detroit Red Wings would probably take an
unheard-of winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Basically it's 61 games down, 21 to go--beginning again Wednesday
at home against the Minnesota Wild--before putting a wrap on another
lost season,  followed by more promise-to-get-better pledges to try
to bring that vanishing breed of Duck fan back from the brink of
extinction.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Ducks don't see this as playing out the string.
There are net gains to pursue.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to try to finish strong and get some momentum going for
next season," left wing Mike Leclerc said. "Everyone has something to
play for, a new contract or a job."</TE>
<TE>   But reality is harsh. Indiana Jones couldn't excavate the Ducks
from the hole they're in.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 20, the Ducks were 14 points out of the eighth playoff
spot. Then they got hot.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 22, after winning seven of nine games, the Ducks are 12
points out of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Cue the "Summer of Solutions" sound bites.</TE>
<TE>   Past summers have inched the Ducks forward ever so slightly.
Things are better than a year ago, but there is a Grand Canyon-like
crevice between Duck talent and playoff talent.</TE>
<TE>   Now, keeping the dwindling masses interested is high on the
immediate agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "For the last 21 games, we need a big-time effort and good results
for our fans, the ones who stuck by us," Coach Bryan Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   That would be about 5,000 people, the number of fans who actually
show up in the Arrowhead Pond most nights.</TE>
<TE>   What those few have seen is a more consistent team that can
rightfully brag about being competitive almost every game. But
record-wise? The Ducks were 17-31-8-5 with 47 points after 61 games
last season. They are 21-31-6-3 with 51 points after 61 this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 21 games left," defenseman Keith Carney said. "We should
be able to have a strong finish."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks finished strong last season, when they were last in the
Western Conference, going 7-6-2 in their last 15 games. Management
tinkered some during the off-season and now the Ducks are next to
last in the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, if we don't make the playoffs, and anything can still
happen, we need to get better," Carney said. "It's not my job to say
what we need or how we're going to do that."</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Pierre Gauthier, whose job it is to say what the
Ducks need to do and then do it, hasn't talked or done much, except
to utter "we're close" and promise to pursue a top player during the
off-season. He has dangled players--lots of them--to other teams, but
that doesn't necessarily mean a deal is near for the big-time scorer
the team desperately needs.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it becomes evaluation of individuals, who fits, where do they
fit and how can they help us?" Murray said. "Maybe we don't need 10
new guys. Maybe we just need a couple guys."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have better talent than last season, but there was
nowhere to go but up.</TE>
<TE>   Carney, picked up in an off-season trade, has been a stabilizing
presence on defense, although Gauthier has cast him as trade bait.</TE>
<TE>   Goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere has established himself.</TE>
<TE>   Center Andy McDonald, a player the Ducks lucked into as an
unwanted free agent from Colgate, has shown what he can do when given
the chance.</TE>
<TE>   Leclerc and Matt Cullen have shown flashes of being the talented
young players they have been touted as by management.</TE>
<TE>   And the Ducks do have one of the NHL's best in Kariya ... for at
least three more seasons. Then he becomes an unrestricted free agent
and could be golden.</TE>

<HD>Portland's Cheeks Enjoys Beating 76ers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Portland Coach Maurice Cheeks enjoyed his return to Philadelphia.
Rasheed Wallace treated it like any other game.</LD>
<LD>   Wallace, a native of Philadelphia, had 29 points and 10 rebounds
and the Trail Blazers won their season-high sixth in a row with an
88-83 victory over the 76ers on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first game in Philadelphia for Cheeks, a former 76er
player and assistant.</LD>
<TE>   "As homecomings go, that was real good," Cheeks said. "It was a
game of runs, and fortunately we had ours at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, whose mother sat courtside, wasn't quite as excited.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nothing special, just a normal basketball game," he said.
"We were just out there playing."</TE>
<TE>   Scottie Pippen led a fourth-quarter rally for the Trail Blazers,
scoring 11 points in an 18-2 run that helped Portland overcome a
nine-point deficit. Pippen finished with 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson, who scored 18 points for the 76ers, said a lack of
effort led to the team's struggles in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been playing hard and the effort is not there,
especially at crucial parts of the game," said Iverson, who claimed
that some "players don't know the plays. There's no excuse for that."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 102, Golden State 97--Reggie Miller scored 12 of his 23
points in overtime and the Pacers overcame a 13-point deficit at
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Artest had 17 points for the Pacers, who moved into the
seventh playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Miller had 16 points and 15 rebounds for his 14th
double-double this season and first with Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 97, Charlotte 92--Wally Szczerbiak scored 24 points for
the Timberwolves and Kevin Garnett had 21 at Charlotte, N.C, to hand
the Hornets their third loss in a row.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Knick center Marcus Camby is expected to sit out the rest
of the regular season because the muscle tear in his hip has improved
little. Camby was injured in a fall during a game against Indiana
nearly four weeks ago. An MRI exam Monday revealed that his bone
bruise improved greatly, but the muscle tear didn't.... Cleveland
backup point guard Bimbo Coles had arthroscopic surgery on his left
knee and will sit out about six weeks.</TE>

<HD>Chandler Is Released by Falcons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Michael Vick era began Monday when the Atlanta Falcons released
Chris Chandler, their starting quarterback the last five seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Receiver Terance Mathis and free safety Ronnie Bradford also were
cut in a purge of high salaries. NFL teams have until Friday to get
under the $71.8-million salary cap for the 2002 season.</LD>
<LD>   Chandler, 36, led the Falcons to the Super Bowl in January 1999,
when they lost to Denver. It was one of the few seasons in his
14-year career when Chandler stayed healthy.</LD>
<TE>   Last season, Chandler started 14 games and finished with 2,847
yards passing.</TE>
<TE>   Vick, the top pick in last year's draft, was Chandler's backup.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that Mike Vick is going to make great strides for us
this season," Coach Dan Reeves said. "The gap between Chris and Mike
is getting narrower, and this move will force us to get him more
playing time. It is a tough decision because I think that Chris can
still play in this league."</TE>
<TE>   Owner Arthur Blank, who took charge of the franchise Feb. 2, wants
Atlanta to be competitive in the free-agent market. Releasing the
veterans and restructuring the contracts of other players probably
will put the Falcons more than $10 million under the salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler's release appeared imminent when Atlanta made him one of
five players available in the Houston Texans' expansion draft Nov.
18. He was due a $5.8-million salary next season.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping Chandler, though, would have resulted in an $8.5-million
cap charge because his contract was restructured twice to give the
Falcons flexibility to sign free agents.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two-time Pro Bowl linebacker Jason Gildon and the Pittsburgh
Steelers agreed to a five-year, $23-million contract that will keep
intact the core of one of the league's top defenses.</TE>
<TE>   Gildon has led the Steelers in sacks the last four seasons and is
third on the team's all-time sack list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New York Jets rewarded Coach Herman Edwards for the team's
first playoff berth in three seasons, giving him a one-year contract
extension.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, who led the Jets to a 10-6 record in his first season as
coach, is signed through the 2005 season. Financial terms of the deal
were not released.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets released punter-quarterback Tom Tupa, receiver Matthew
Hatchette and safety Chris Hayes to clear $1.5 million in salary-cap
room.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New England cut receivers Curtis Jackson and Charles Johnson and
cornerback Terrence Shaw, and signed defensive tackle Jayce
Saylor.... Cleveland released offensive lineman Roman Oben, citing
the need for changes on its line.</TE>
<TE>   College Football</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina quarterback Darian Durant, who last year set
freshman season passing records for the Tar Heels, said he will
transfer after the spring semester for personal reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Durant, who shared time with senior Ronald Curry, had 1,843 yards
passing, 17 touchdowns and 142 completions.</TE>
<TE>   Horse Racing</TE>
<TE>   Gourmet Girl, a $3,500 yearling who went on to earn $1.2 million
and win an Eclipse Award, has been retired. She probably will be bred
to a top Kentucky stallion in the coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   A California-bred daughter of Cee's Tizzy--who also sired Tiznow,
the 2000 horse of the year and winner of the last two Breeders' Cup
Classics--Gourmet Girl won the Apple Blossom and Vanity handicaps
last year and was voted the best older filly or mare in North
America.</TE>
<TE>   Gourmet Girl's last race was a second-place finish to Tranquility
Lake in the Clement L. Hirsch Handicap at Del Mar in August. The
7-year-old mare retired with nine victories, seven seconds and 10
thirds in 33 starts.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation into a barn fire at Ocala (Fla.) Stud Farm has
not turned up any indications of arson.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two horses, mostly 2-and 3-year-olds in training, died in
the Saturday afternoon fire. The casualties included two horses sired
by 1990 Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, insurance agent Rhonda Mack said the cause of the
fire may have been electrical. But authorities later said the cause
had not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Former Laker and Cal State Fullerton forward Cedric Ceballos has
signed with the first-year Las Vegas Slam of the American Basketball
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR officials said they will wait until today to take action
against Roush Racing for failing a postrace inspection after driver
Matt Kenseth won the Subway 400 on Sunday at Rockingham, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Kenseth's Ford was found to be about a quarter-inch lower than the
minimum 51 inches off the ground in the inspection about three hours
after the race.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR said Kenseth's victory and championship points are likely
to stand.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve-year-old Michelle Wie claimed one of two qualifying spots
for the LPGA Tour's season-opening $900,000 Takefuji Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Wie shot an 83 in windy conditions at Waikoloa Beach Resort in
Hawaii, finishing second to fellow amateur Sally Soranaka, who shot a
79.</TE>
<TE>   The 132-player tournament begins Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Alexi Lalas scored after volleying in his own rebounded header
early in the second half as the Galaxy defeated Universidad Catolica
reserves, 1-0, at Santiago in the fourth game of a five-game Chilean
exhibition tour.</TE>
<TE>   Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic lost to Nicholas Keifer, 6-3,
6-4, in the first round of the Dubai Open at United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Greg Rusedski of England beat Germany's Lars
Burgsmuller, 6-4, 7-5, in the first round of the Siebel Open in San
Jose. Australian Wayne Arthurs defeated Michael Chang, 6-3, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Ellis Jones, a standout offensive lineman at Tulsa despite having
only one arm, died Sunday at Sterling, Colo. He was 80.</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Nothing Is Out of the Question at This Stage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that the Olympics have come to a close, it's time for the NHL to
get back to business. With seven weeks remaining in the regular
season, the league is facing a truckload of unanswered questions:</LD>
<LD>   Are the Kings a legitimate Stanley Cup contender? Maybe. Although
it may be a while before Coach Andy Murray recovers from
post-concussion syndrome, the Kings head into their stretch run as
one of the best-coached teams in the league. Thanks to their dominant
special teams (No. 2 in the power play and penalty kill at the
Olympic break), the Kings will be a difficult team to defeat in close
games. If Felix Potvin and Jamie Storr can continue to give the team
solid goaltending, the Kings may be ready to advance even deeper into
the playoffs than they did last season. Another postseason strong
point for the Kings will be their scoring depth with at least six
players with 12 or more goals and 10 players with 20 or more points.
Philadelphia is the only team in the league with more scoring depth.</LD>
<TE>   Can the Mighty Ducks make a run at .500? Unlikely.  Coach Bryan
Murray has done an admirable job of returning the Ducks to a
respectable level, but they are 10 games under .500 with only 21 to
play. It would take a minor miracle for Anaheim to even catch
up-and-coming Nashville. Look for Paul Kariya to play well now that
he has a gold medal to his credit but the Ducks need more consistent
offense from players such as Jeff Friesen, Matt Cullen, Mike Leclerc
and German Titov. It also doesn't help that the Ducks play 18 teams
over .500.</TE>
<TE>   Will the Detroit Red Wings continue to dominate the league? Maybe.
Coach Scotty Bowman's team is loaded with future Hall of Famers but
their age may work against them. Detroit had the NHL's largest
contingent at the Olympics. Four of their players reached the
gold-medal game in Salt Lake City. But that could present a problem
for the veteran Red Wings, who now open their post-Olympic push with
15 games in 33 days, including 10 games on the road and two six-game
stretches that include five road games. Injuries may become an issue:
Captain Steve Yzerman is already hampered by bad knees and 40-year
old defenseman Chris Chelios gave everything he had in the Olympics.
And left wing Brendan Shanahan revealed Monday that he broke a thumb
in the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Can Colorado repeat as Stanley Cup champion? Absolutely. The
Avalanche will not only have a rested goaltender in Patrick Roy, who
opted not to play in the Olympics for Canada, but they also will play
six games in a row at home with none on consecutive nights to start
their stretch run. Center Joe Sakic and defensemen Rob Blake and Adam
Foote were dominant players in the Olympics and are still hungry
enough to lead Colorado's Stanley Cup quest.</TE>
<TE>   Which Western Conference teams will not make the playoffs?
Columbus, Minnesota, Nashville and the Ducks can definitely make
early summer vacation plans but it's not that easy figuring out what
other teams will join them. Even though Edmonton is currently the No.
7 seed in the conference, look for the Oilers to drop if goaltender
Tommy Salo can't bounce back after giving up the winning goal for
Sweden in an upset Olympic loss to Belarus. Although Phoenix is
having a solid season, the Coyotes do not play defense well enough to
stay in the playoff race. Calgary is another team with issues because
Jarome Iginla can't do it all.</TE>
<TE>   Who will emerge as the class team in the Eastern Conference?
Philadelphia. If goaltender Roman Cechmanek remains steady, the
Flyers will be the team to beat in the East. General Manager Bobby
Clarke has to be excited about his team's chances with Jeremy
Roenick, Mark Recchi, Simon Gagne and John LeClair providing one of
the most feared offensive attacks in the league. The midseason pickup
of tough guy Donald Brashear and the return of former King Rick
Tocchet, who has rehabilitated a torn patella tendon in his left
knee, also will help. The Flyers, however, will not have an easy time
in the East because Boston and Toronto also will be ready.</TE>
<TE>   Will Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux make it through the remainder of
the season? Unclear. Now that he has finally won his long-awaited
gold medal, Lemieux's fortitude will surely be tested playing for the
struggling Penguins. Then there is the question of how Lemieux
responds when his hip injury acts up again. With Pittsburgh
continuing play today seven points out of a playoff berth, Lemieux
may start seeing himself again as more of an owner than a player. If
that happens, expect him not to finish the season in uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Can Calgary's Iginla hold on to the league's scoring lead? No. If
Iginla played on a team with more scoring options, he would likely
become the first player of color to win the NHL's Art Ross trophy.
But he doesn't. Although Iginla has ranked near the top in points
since October, Calgary has scored only one more goal than the Ducks
this season. Boston's Joe Thornton or Vancouver's Markus Naslund are
more likely to produce more points because both are more assist-men
than goal scorers.</TE>
<TE>   Will Washington fire Coach Ron Wilson before the season ends?
Probably not. Wilson is definitely under the microscope but the
Capitals are too talented not to make a run for the playoffs.
Washington has been inconsistent all season but the Capitals are only
five points from the No. 8 spot in the East and will play six of
their next eight games at home. But if Washington fails to make up
ground soon, Wilson may get the boot because the Capitals face a
killer eight-game, 14-day trip in March that includes games at San
Jose, Colorado and Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Which team is a dark horse to win the Stanley Cup? St. Louis. But
for the Blues to get out of the West, they will need a healthy Keith
Tkachuk, who played hurt for the U.S. in the Olympic gold-medal game.
Tkachuk, Pavol Demitra and Doug Weight are legitimate offensive
forces and no hype is needed for defensemen Chris Pronger and Al
MacInnis. The key for the Blues will be goaltender Brent Johnson, who
has to be the least respected netminder in the league despite 23
victories and a .902 save percentage at the Olympic break.</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   The NHL may look to adopt a key rule used in the Olympics to speed
up play for next season. Prompted by positive results of hurry-up
faceoffs that were featured in Salt Lake City, the league is
seriously thinking about adopting it. It would stop teams from
delaying games with line changes during stoppages of play. The rule
calls for the visiting team to have five seconds to make a line
change and then the home team has five seconds to send out its
players. The referee then has five seconds to drop the puck. The
American Hockey League and junior hockey are already using versions
of the rule and the NHL has been pleased with the results.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Rangers' Mark Messier has been contemplating
season-ending shoulder surgery and if he does opt for it, his career
may be in jeopardy. Messier, who turned 41 last month, said he's
going to wait for at least a couple of weeks before making his
decision, but he's tired of playing in pain. Messier missed 11
consecutive games and 15 of 18 before playing in the last five games
before the Olympic break. He had one power play assist and a
minus-five rating in the five games.</TE>

<HD>Robinson Returns to New Jersey as an Assistant</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recently fired coach Larry Robinson is returning to the New Jersey
Devils as an assistant while John Cunniff undergoes treatment for a
recurrence of throat cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Cunniff, who became an assistant under Kevin Constantine when
Robinson was fired Jan. 28, spent the last two weeks as an assistant
to Herb Brooks on the U.S. Olympic team that won a silver medal at
Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   Devil President Lou Lamoriello said Cunniff was told about the
cancer before the Olympics, and that he wanted to go Salt Lake City
anyway.</LD>
<TE>   "That's the way he is," Lamoriello said. "I have known him for
such a long time. He's an exceptional person. This is John."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson was to rejoin the Devils today, when they return from the
Olympic break for a game in New York against the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, who has been at his home in Florida, was not immediately
available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Constantine didn't think it would be awkward working with the man
he replaced.</TE>
<TE>   "It's different, but different only in that it hasn't been done
that much before," said Constantine, who has guided the Devils to a
4-1-2 record since taking over.</TE>
<TE>   Devil captain Scott Stevens said Robinson was the first person he
thought of when he heard that Cunniff would be leaving the team.</TE>
<TE>   "It will work," Stevens said. "That's not even a question."</TE>
<TE>   That was the same business approach that Lamoriello used when he
fired the easygoing Robinson in January, less than a season after the
Hall of Famer led the Devils within one victory of consecutive
Stanley Cup titles.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think Larry's an excellent coach," Lamoriello said when
he fired Robinson. "Larry did everything and anything he possibly
could. They weren't responding on a consistent basis."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Shanahan, who had an assist in Canada's run to the gold
medal at Salt Lake City, broke his right thumb during the Olympic
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan, who leads the Detroit Red Wings in scoring with 30 goals
and 27 assists, confirmed to The Detroit News that his thumb was
broken during his first shift in a game against Finland.</TE>
<TE>   Red Wing spokesman John Hahn said that the team's medical staff
will look at Shanahan's thumb when the left wing returns to the team.</TE>

<HD>Investigation Clears U.S. Hockey Players</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Members of the U.S. women's hockey team did not desecrate a Canadian
flag at the Salt Lake City Olympics, American and Canadian hockey
officials said Monday after an investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Canada defeated the U.S., 3-2, to win the gold medal Feb. 21.
After the game, Canadian players said they were angered that American
players stomped on a flag in their locker room.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. players repeatedly and vehemently denied the rumor.</LD>
<TE>   USA Hockey and the Canadian Hockey Assn. issued a joint statement
saying U.S. players had committed no "acts of disrespect" against the
flag.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case of false information being circulated by an
unidentified third party," USA Hockey Executive Director Doug
Palazzari said. "There is no question there is a healthy rivalry
between the two teams, but there is also great mutual respect."</TE>
<TE>   Canadian Hockey Assn. President Bob Nicholson corroborated the
findings.</TE>
<TE>   "We congratulate the U.S. team on a tremendous season and look
forward to continuing our great relationship with USA Hockey,"
Nicholson said.</TE>

<TE>   Sarah Hughes' performance landed her on the Olympic podium with a
gold medal--and also put her on boxes of Wheaties.</TE>
<TE>   The cereal company will make the 18-ounce package available in
March.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes joins fellow figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi, the 1980 U.S.
men's hockey team and others who have been featured on the cereal's
orange box since the 1930s.</TE>

<TE>   It's payback time for Utah taxpayers who shouldered some of the
cost of the Salt Lake City Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic organizers say they will deliver two checks to the Utah
Capitol today, a week before the bills are due.</TE>
<TE>   One check will repay Utah $59 million for building two of the
Olympic venues. Another leaves a $40 million "legacy" investment fund
to pay for venue upkeep.</TE>

<HD>NBC Wins in Games of Ratings, Reviews</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Television executives often play games with ratings.</LD>
<LD>   If an event gets good ratings but critics pan it, the executives
will point to the ratings and say their people must have done
something right, as if ratings are a barometer for the quality of
coverage.</LD>
<LD>   If an event gets bad ratings and also gets panned, then the
executives will say the ratings have nothing to do with the quality
of coverage.</LD>
<TE>   NBC executives can rest easy today. Whether talking about Winter
Olympics ratings or reaction from critics, it's mostly good.</TE>
<TE>   The closing ceremony Sunday night earned a 22.3 national rating
with a 33% share of the audience, pushing the prime-time average for
the 17 days of coverage to a 19.2/31, 18% higher than the 16.3/26 CBS
averaged for the Winter Olympics from Nagano, Japan, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In the Pacific time zone, where the prime-time coverage was
delayed, the average was a 21.6/34, and Los Angeles averaged a
19.5/30.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's gold-medal hockey game, shown live at noon on the West
Coast, got a 10.7/24 rating nationally and a 9.2/23 in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The national rating was the highest for any hockey game since
1980.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-Soviet Union game at the Winter Olympics that year got a
23.9 and the U.S. and Finland game two days later in which the U.S.
clinched the gold got a 23.2.</TE>
<TE>   As for critical reviews, a headline in the Washington Post read,
"For the Most Part, TV Performance was a Gold Medal Effort." A San
Francisco Examiner critic wrote, "Night after night, the prime-time
show [was] can't-miss entertainment." The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
said: "It proved to be a successful miniseries for NBC. It was
good--often great--TV."</TE>
<TE>   If there was one moment where NBC dropped the ball, it was
Thursday night at the end of the women's figure skating, the marquee
event. The complaint was the announcers didn't make it clear exactly
how Sarah Hughes won the gold medal and how Michelle Kwan ended up
with the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Patrick and partner Rob Dibble were discussing that point on
ESPN Radio Monday. Patrick said he was confused, while, oddly, Dibble
thought it was pretty clear.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever, the up-close pictures of Hughes and her coach made it
obvious to viewers who won the gold, even if they were confused how
she did it.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, what was good about NBC's coverage was that it was
event-driven, well-edited and there was a minimum of studio
chit-chat. There were fewer up-close profiles, and the ones NBC did
show seemed less intrusive than the ones at previous Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol said, "I think the greatest thing
I learned from these Games was that I had a lot to learn about
listening.</TE>
<TE>   "Following Sydney, which I felt from the production end was well
done, I came back and listened, particularly to my friends. I read
back over a lot of the writers that I respect and saw their
viewpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "From that point, we planned accordingly to evolve the way we do
the Games to a more event-driven series of telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   "That wasn't as simple as it sounds because we had to also really
work much more closely with our announcers, because storytelling is
still the key to the Olympics. We had to find a way to have them
deliver much more of the storytelling through their commentary than
as feature material.</TE>
<TE>   "I really did learn a lot about listening and I think that will
carry over to subsequent Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   In past Olympics, even before e-mail, the complaints would pour
into The Times from viewers--about everything from the delays to
short shrift for some sports to the overabundance of the up-close
features to you name it.</TE>
<TE>   The complaints this time were held to a minimum. Sure, you're not
going to please everyone, but NBC seemed to come pretty close.</TE>
<TE>   There weren't even many complaints about the delayed coverage on
the West Coast. Actually, a number of people said they appreciated
the fact the coverage didn't begin until they could get home, eat
dinner and then sit down in front of the television set.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the commercials drew many complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important that so many sponsors of these Games went
out of their way to come out with creative ads that was interesting
and applicable to the Olympics," Ebersol said. "It made the
commercial flow a lot easier to deal with I think."</TE>
<TE>   About the Salt Lake Games in general, Ebersol said: "They are far
and away the best I've ever been involved in. It's hard for me to say
that, because I would have told you three years ago that it never
would have turned out that way.</TE>
<TE>   "This surpassed my wildest expectations."</TE>
<TE>   From a viewer's standpoint, or a critic's, the same thing could be
said about NBC's coverage.</TE>

<HD>In Any Event, Games Did Have Moment of Humility</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Everyone comes to the Olympics looking for that moment, that one
special instant that restores our faith in everything great and
important and enduring about the greatest sport spectacle in the
world.</LD>
<LD>   On the second night of the 19th Winter Games, I was blessed with
that moment.</LD>
<LD>   It was around midnight in downtown Salt Lake City, the streets
teeming with celebrating fans, strutting athletes, many languages,
one voice.</LD>
<TE>   I was in the middle of a crosswalk, headlights illuminating me
from all directions, bathing my body like thousands of shiny medals.</TE>
<TE>   When my snow pants fell to my ankles.</TE>
<TE>   Let me back up here a second.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't my snow pants. I don't do snow pants.</TE>
<TE>   I'm from the South, I live in Southern California, I don't do
snow. I don't do slush. I draw the line at Slurpee.</TE>
<TE>   The snow pants belonged to photographer Kirk McKoy. He lent them
to me at the opening ceremony, when my knees had started knocking
after standing for nearly two hours in a security line in 20-degree
temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   McKoy had an extra pair. I tried them on. They fit. I think. I had
no idea.</TE>
<TE>   Newly fortified, I walked from the media tent into outdoor
Rice-Eccles Stadium dressed as I would be for the next 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Long johns. Wool socks. Wool pants. Snow pants. Turtleneck.
Sweater. Fleece coat. Parka. Inner gloves. Outer gloves. Ski cap.</TE>
<TE>   I waddled to my seat where, just as the Olympic theme was playing
and the ceremony was beginning, I dropped my pencil.</TE>
<TE>   I leaned over to pick it up, fell, and couldn't get back up.</TE>
<TE>   It was at this point that a kind volunteer hovered above me and
verbalized what became my own personal Olympic theme.</TE>
<TE>   "Um, sir, I think your snow pants are on backward."</TE>
<TE>   So, you see, they weren't my snow pants.</TE>
<TE>   And, having now covered my first Winter Olympics, I can safely say
that these aren't my Games.</TE>
<TE>   Not because they were too scandalous, or too maudlin, or too long.</TE>
<TE>   Because they were too cold.</TE>
<TE>   What a great idea, holding outdoor events in the mountains in
mid-February. Whoever thought of it should be forced to ride down an
icy track on a real skeleton.</TE>
<TE>   The final week here was relatively mild--I wore only one pair of
gloves--but that doesn't compensate for the 10 frostbitten days spent
standing for hours in 10-degree temperatures watching the final 10
seconds of a ski race.</TE>
<TE>   Haven't these people ever heard of, I don't know, the Fall
Olympics?</TE>
<TE>   Every day, it took me at least 30 minutes to get dressed, and 10
minutes to recover from getting dressed.</TE>
<TE>   I wrenched my shoulder trying to put on my coat. I twisted my back
trying to put on snow boots. I pulled a calf muscle trying to remove
my long johns. I used up all of my complimentary bottles of shampoo
trying to wash them.</TE>
<TE>   Once bundled, I would consistently limp outside in all these
layers with all these zippers and nearly die.</TE>
<TE>   Not of hypothermia, but of heat exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   When I desperately shed some of the clothes and threw them on a
fence in the skiing corral, then the hypothermia would hit.</TE>
<TE>   During those few moments in the last two weeks when I was not
getting dressed or undressed, I examined all the sports here and came
to this reasonable conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   There is absolutely no reason the Winter Olympics need to be held
during winter.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarders are skateboarders in thermals. Bobsledders and lugers
can do it on wheels. Cross-country skiers can put on cheap running
shoes like the rest of us. Ski jumpers can use the pool. And Alpine
skiers, well, we stink at that sport anyway.</TE>
<TE>   But back to the crosswalk.</TE>
<TE>   So my snow pants, backward and unbuttoned because I couldn't find
the buttons, fell to my ankles. At the same time, the loose waist of
my regular pants began dropping.</TE>
<TE>   It was at this point, in the middle of the road, that I was forced
to stop walking. Cars started honking. People started laughing.</TE>
<TE>   I could have shimmied away in embarrassment. But no. I hung tough.
Still in the crosswalk, I dropped my computer case, leaned down and,
in one motion, pulled up the snow pants and found a zipper and
fiddled with a button and righted myself before the light changed.</TE>
<TE>   An Olympic moment indeed.</TE>
<TE>   For those keeping score at home, I earned only a 4.9 for technical
merit, but a 6.0 for presentation.</TE>

<HD>Want to Sire an Olympic Hopeful? Talk to Gene</HD>

<LD>The Olympic Games depress me, so I am glad they are over. I don't
need to be reminded every four winters that I married a woman who
comes from a family of oafs, which wasn't capable of producing a
gifted athlete, thereby making my children too uncoordinated to win a
medal.</LD>
<LD>   It's not my fault, of course, because I was young and seduced by
this woman, never knowing it would end my Olympic dreams.</LD>
<LD>   But I think about it when I see figure skater Sasha Cohen handing
her cell phone to the president of the United States during the
opening ceremony so he can talk to her parents.</LD>
<TE>   I look at my wife, and she's so short and clumsy, and I understand
why I've never talked to the president.</TE>
<TE>   I never gave something like that a thought when we were dating. I
had my mind on other things, I guess, so I also never took note of
her three brothers, Moe, Larry and Curly until it was too late. As a
result, when it came time to have a baby, the best we could hope for
from this gene pool was the heir apparent to Max Patkin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I BELIEVE you can mark it down as a medical certainty--the reason
we never had a boy was because my wife is short and clumsy.</TE>
<TE>   I was under constant stress, worried she would give birth to a
clumsy shrimp, and because stress is a Y chromosome killer, we ended
up with two girls.</TE>
<TE>   This week she began talking about performance-enhancing drugs, and
while I keep telling her that's not the Olympic way, after watching
the athletes go at it for the past two weeks I think she's really
into this "thrill of victory and agony of defeat."</TE>
<TE>   She said she doesn't approve of drug use, but could certainly
understand why someone might go to such desperate lengths. I can
relate.</TE>
<TE>   Our second child tried basketball, and I remember watching her
games and the taller kids swatting the ball into her face--then
looking at my short wife and wondering why I never put the moves on
Shirley H., who topped six feet.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley could have gotten the dishes down off the top shelf and
saved me from getting off the couch every time my wife wants to eat.</TE>
<TE>   And while this keeps me in good shape, I'm telling you there are
things you should take into consideration when you're dating that you
just don't think about until it's too late and you have to decide
whether you want a stepladder permanently parked in your kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose it's still a good idea to get married because you're in
love, but now that they've moved the Winter and Summer Olympics so we
get one or the other every two years, they're not much fun to watch
if you're stuck with ho-hum kids.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the Olympic possibilities had I married someone from
Nebraska, who grew up shooting game for dinner--coupled with my
earlier Idaho expertise as a skier--we might have given birth to the
U.S.'s top biathlon contender.</TE>
<TE>   These are the decisions people make in their lives--sometimes with
a gold medal hanging in the balance--a short clumsy girl from Chicago
or a homely hick from Nebraska?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TELL ME you haven't thought about it while looking at your own
ordinary kids sprawled across the floor--as the NBC cameras linger
lovingly on the skier or figure skater who is about to make
everyone's heart bust with pride.</TE>
<TE>   For every Olympic athlete, there's a set of parents
watching--ready to burst from the excitement of impending
endorsements and what they might get for all those trips to the rink.
Had we married differently--that might be you or me.</TE>
<TE>   A set of lucky Olympic parents will have a kid who wins a gold
medal and the $25,000 that comes with it, while you and I have a lump
on the end of the couch who wants to know why there isn't onion dip
to go with the potato chips they're mashing into the carpet.</TE>
<TE>   Consider your own boring life. If only you had a 16-year-old like
Sarah Hughes instead of the teenage troublemaker presently pushing
your buttons ... experts figure Hughes will earn more than $10
million in endorsements and personal appearances before she turns 21.</TE>
<TE>   If I were her dad, I'd immediately ground her--only agreeing to
spring her for $3 million. My wife then could make her own deal.</TE>
<TE>   Just think, if you hadn't married the person you did--maybe
catching Dorothy Hamill on the rebound from one of her two failed
marriages, and producing a Sarah Hughes-like skater, the TV cameras
finding you in the crowd and the commentators telling everyone in the
world what a wonderful parent you must be.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic attention can be a gold mine. Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier, skaters expected to prosper because of controversy, have
already signed a toothpaste deal.</TE>
<TE>   I'll just be happy if it convinces our 22-year-old to try the
stuff.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MY ONLY shot now for Olympic fame is a grandchild sired by a
grocery store bagger.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE WERE a number of people who apparently were bothered by the
sight of Janet Jones--born in Bridgeton, Mo., residing in Southern
California, and married to Wayne Gretzky--jumping up and down in glee
after the Canadian hockey team defeated the U.S. for gold.</TE>
<TE>   Let me just say I'm never bothered by the sight of Janet Jones
jumping up and down in glee, and as a fellow American, I defend her
right to hang onto Gretzky and the lifestyle she's become accustomed
to living.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Charley:</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see you on TV Sunday night--where were you?''</TE>
<TE>   Salma Hayek was missing, too, wasn't she?</TE>

<HD>He Traveled Far to Find His Own Paradise by Sea</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a gorgeous Sunday morning at Oceanside Harbor Beach, where
dozens of groggy teenagers dressed in stylish wetsuits are preparing
to compete in the Interscholastic Surfing Federation championships.</LD>
<LD>   There are no cheerleaders, no tuba players, no college scouts and
no profanity-yelling spectators.</LD>
<LD>   There is only one sportswriter foolish enough to rise at 4:15 a.m.
and drive 110 miles from the San Fernando Valley to learn what makes
teenagers sacrifice sleeping in on a Sunday morning for the thrill of
riding a wave.</LD>
<TE>   The water temperature is a chilly 58 degrees, but no one is
complaining. Southern California is known for its earthquakes, smog
alerts, car chases and sensational murder trials, but it's days like
this that make many vow to never leave.</TE>
<TE>   A quick scan of the newspaper's weather page reveals it's 20
degrees in Fairbanks, Alaska; 48 in Milwaukee; 54 in Chicago; 41 in
Concord, N.H.; 19 in Billings, Mont.; 32 in Spokane, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Here, it's paradise, with temperatures in the 60s and waves
between two and four feet.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so the teenagers aren't munching on granola bars for their
pre-surf meal. They're eating doughnuts.</TE>
<TE>   "We go for the sugar high," one coach said.</TE>
<TE>   Three to a team, they paddle out, eventually numbering 24
competitors in four heats, one high school surfing squad competing
against another, with judges awarding points based on wave selection,
length of ride and style.</TE>
<TE>   No one is making jokes about any of the judges being from France,
although Coach Steve Marion from Long Beach Wilson said, "I believe
they're all from another country when they judge my kids."</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 300 surfers representing 26 schools. The 4-A
division is made up of coastal high schools within five miles of the
beach. The 3-A division is composed of inland schools.</TE>
<TE>   Some surfers wanted to be inconspicuous, like Luke Swift of Santa
Ana Mater Dei. By day, he's a junior varsity basketball player.
There's no way he wants varsity basketball Coach Gary McKnight to
know that instead of practicing jump shots on a Sunday morning, he's
going airborne on a Fiberglas board after pumping himself up with
high-volume punk rock.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if any of his basketball buddies were joining him, Swift
said, "They're all asleep."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Steinriede, coach at Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley, said he
doesn't have too many problems filling spots on his surf team.</TE>
<TE>   "The chicks dig the surfers more than football players," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Steinriede's daughter, Lindsay, surfs for rival Dana Hills. She
plays volleyball, soccer and is a pole vaulter. She was taking a nap
in her father's truck before hitting the waves. Is surfing really
worth it?</TE>
<TE>   "It's what I do with my free time," she said. "There's definitely
a lot of hot guys out here."</TE>
<TE>   The girls don't surf solely because of the company. Like the boys,
they surf for the adrenaline rush.</TE>
<TE>   "I love surfing," said freshman Erica Hosseini of San Clemente.
"I'll do anything for surfing. All my friends think I'm crazy. A lot
of people don't understand. They go, 'Oh, the water is so cold,' but
once you get on the wave, there's no stopping you."</TE>
<TE>   Two juniors, Travis Mellem of San Clemente and Brett Simpson of
Huntington Beach, are surfing's equivalent of a highly-recruited
football standout. Everyone recognizes them on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson leaves in April on a trip to Panama for a surfing magazine
photo shoot. He has been surfing since he was 12, when a friend
introduced him to the sport. Now he surfs every day, morning and
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "I got addicted to it," he said. "It's the funnest thing."</TE>
<TE>   The fact he earns five units school credit for surfing class is
"the best thing that can ever be," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mellem started surfing at 9 and is one of the best for his age
group.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always fun," he said. "It's something I can do for the rest
of my life."</TE>
<TE>   There are stereotypes of surfers being part of some counterculture
who utter only words such as "dude." But you can find as many honor
students on the beach as in the school library.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente has become the surfing mecca of high schools. The
Tritons won the overall state championship Sunday after first-place
finishes in girls' shortboard, longboard and bodyboard and a
second-place finish in boys' shortboard. Huntington Beach, led by
Simpson, won the boys' shortboard title.</TE>
<TE>   There were no scenes of surfers smashing boards, having temper
tantrums or threatening to transfer to a better surfing school.</TE>
<TE>   This was high school sports at its best.</TE>
<TE>   "You can lose and still have fun," said junior Ryan Deffebach of
Aliso Niguel.</TE>

<LD>Dijon Thompson's bruised knee healed enough for him to practice
Monday, and it appears he will be 100% when UCLA faces Oregon State
on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The freshman guard hurt the knee bumping into another player in
the second half of UCLA's 95-92 victory over Stanford on Saturday. He
did not return, ending his best performance in months.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson made four of five shots, including his only three-point
attempt, and four of four free throws for 13 points, one shy of his
season high set against UC Irvine on Dec. 15. All the free throws
came under pressure in the last two minutes.</LD>
<TE>   "When my first shot went in, I felt like I would have a good
rhythm," he said. "It's been like that. When I start strong, I do
well. More than anything, I'm trying to do whatever I can to help us
win."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson also has cut down on turnovers, especially his tendency
to force passes into traffic. He had one turnover in 14 minutes
against Stanford and has only five in the last nine games.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been focusing on taking care of the ball and not making
foolish freshman mistakes," he said. "I want to make things happen, I
just have to be smart."</TE>

<HD>Mom's Illness Affects Clancy</HD>
<DH>Academics: Target of jeers, USC star says he missed Wooden
Award standard after learning of his mother's diagnosis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanford fans chanted a hearty and ruthless "1.9, 1.9" at him every
time he touched the ball.</LD>
<LD>   California students made copies of Sam Clancy's mugshot with "1.9"
in huge type beneath his countenance.</LD>
<LD>   Bay Area fans delighted last weekend in reminding the USC senior
power forward of his cumulative grade-point average, which on Monday
officially knocked him out of consideration for the Wooden Award and
the Wooden All-American team. But they weren't aware of the whole
story.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of people don't know that last semester my mom was
diagnosed with breast cancer," Clancy said Monday afternoon after
practice. "It threw me. My grades kind of slipped a little bit and I
dropped below a 2.0 [GPA]. Now I'm working to get it back up....</TE>
<TE>   "But now she's doing better. They took out the cancer in the lymph
nodes. A lot of people didn't know that that affected me in class and
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Anetta Harris, who lives in Cleveland, has been undergoing
chemotherapy treatments since the diagnosis. She will be in town,
though, for the Trojans' final two regular-season contests: Thursday
against Pacific 10-leading Oregon and Senior Day on Saturday against
Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Harris told The Times last month that she was honored by Clancy's
decision to dedicate his senior season to her, though Clancy did not
mention at the time that his mother had been diagnosed with cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like the power behind the throne," Harris said of her son.
"You can feel his presence. If he wasn't my son, he'd be my friend."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, meanwhile, didn't make many friends at California's Haas
Pavilion, where the jeers continued to accelerate throughout USC's
83-64 loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a smart comment to [the student section], and that really
set the tone for the game about how much they were going to talk
about me," said Clancy, whose streak of 11 consecutive double-doubles
ended when he finished with 11 points and six rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "They were chanting, '1.9,' and I walked over there and said,
'$1.9 million.'"</TE>
<TE>   Clancy was referring to the NBA riches he could earn after the
June draft.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA eligibility guidelines require that students beginning their
senior year have a grade-point average that is at least 95% of the
university's minimum required for graduation.</TE>
<TE>   USC's minimum GPA for graduating is 2.0 and 95% of 2.0 is 1.9,
which is why he maintains his eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   "I do school, but it was never my favorite thing to do," said
Clancy, a sociology major. "I was always like a C-student. I never
got the A's and Bs. My brother [Samario] and sister [Samantha] do,
and I don't know how they do it.</TE>
<TE>   "My sister got [an academic] scholarship to go to the University
of Richmond and she gets a 4.0. My brother goes to my same high
school and he's getting like a 3.8. I was always like a 2.5. I've
never been on [academic] probation before."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy's said his cumulative GPA dipped below 2.0 after the fall
2001 semester.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's not that disappointing," he said. "I'm doing what I like
and I'm pretty successful with it."</TE>
<TE>   The only real disappointment, then, is with his impending
exclusion from Wooden Award consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Wooden Award director Mike Solum received notification from USC on
Monday that Clancy had not met the committee's required 2.0 grade
average. Clancy had made the cut to 30 semifinalists, but the list
will be trimmed to 15 and announced Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame," Solum said. "We sure would have liked to have had
the local flavor. But that's how the award was established and what
makes it so prestigious."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Henry Bibby said he felt for Clancy. "On and off the floor,
he's been a model citizen for me, and it's disappointing because the
kid is deserving of that and he's a good kid," Bibby said. "He's too
nice a kid."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy has 17 double-doubles this season and is averaging 18.9
points, 9.8 rebounds and 1.9 blocked shots, but he realizes his
chances, even if he were eligible, of winning the top individual
prize in college basketball were remote. "Let's be reasonable," he
said. "It's nice to be [mentioned], but then they'll kick me out
before they make the five [finalists] anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "People can look at me and say, 'Oh yeah, he's just another dumb
athlete who's playing basketball [because of the poor grades].' But
there's a deeper reason behind it."</TE>

<HD>Williams Surrenders, Is Charged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FLEMINGTON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Former NBA player Jayson Williams surrendered to police Monday and
was charged with manslaughter in the shooting death of a limousine
driver--a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   The NBC Sports commentator, accompanied by two men, walked through
a back entrance into the state police barracks in Kingwood. He didn't
comment as he entered or left.</LD>
<LD>   Costas Christofi, 55, was found shot to death in the master
bedroom at Williams' 65-acre estate in Alexandria Township on Feb.
14. According to the criminal complaint, Williams was the only person
near Christofi when the gun went off.</LD>
<TE>   "The death of Mr. Christofi was a tragic accident, but it was an
accident," said Williams' attorney, Joseph Hayden. "We are very
confident that after a full, fair and thorough exploration of all the
facts it will be clear that Mr. Williams is innocent of recklessness
and innocent of any criminal conduct."</TE>
<TE>   Acting Hunterdon County Prosecutor Steven Lember would not discuss
details of the case, but said he was convinced Williams caused
Christofi's death by recklessly handling the shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   "I agree it was tragic and it may even have been an accident. But
at base, every reckless manslaughter is an accident," Lember said.</TE>
<TE>   Lember said authorities want to interview more witnesses.
Christofi's death was initially reported as a suicide but later ruled
a homicide.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' brother and 11 other guests, including four players from
the Harlem Globetrotters and a 14-year-old and 6-year-old, were at
the house the night of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "We are most interested in getting to the truth in this case.
Those witnesses should come forward and do the right thing. If they
do, they have nothing to be concerned about," Lember said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was released on $250,000 bail and required to turn over
his weapons to police. His first court appearance in the case was
scheduled for March 4 in Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Manslaughter, commonly referred to as reckless manslaughter,
applies under New Jersey law when a death is "committed recklessly."
It carries a penalty of five to 15 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Lember told the New York Daily News that his office also was
investigating whether Williams allowed Christofi to bleed to death
before authorities were notified. Lember said Monday that after
speaking to the medical examiner, he believes Christofi died quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Published reports have said Williams was playfully twirling a
shotgun while giving a tour of his 30,000-square-foot home when the
weapon fired, hitting Christofi. Hayden has denied there was any
horseplay.</TE>
<TE>   Lember would not provide details of the shooting, citing the
ongoing investigation. He did say authorities were investigating
reports that Williams had been drinking.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-10 Williams was once among the NBA's best rebounders,
but leg injuries ended his basketball career. He retired from the New
Jersey Nets in 2000 and now works for NBC Sports as an NBA studio
analyst.</TE>
<TE>   NBC Sports Vice President Kevin Sullivan said the network would
not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Williams also faces a hearing on a charge that he pushed a police
officer last November in a New Jersey bar.</TE>

<HD>Tournament Has Pac-10 Thinking</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pacific 10 Conference regular season has ended, and no one will
remember it more fondly than Stanford, which was undefeated in
conference play for the fourth time.</LD>
<LD>   But now that the Pac-10 has installed a postseason tournament,
some coaches are calling for changes in the regular-season conference
schedule.</LD>
<LD>   More than one coach would like to see the season reduced from 18
games to 16. The two most offered reasons: Teams could schedule more
nonconference games, and the conference season could go back to
starting in January instead of December.</LD>
<TE>   "It would give us so much more flexibility in preseason
scheduling," Arizona State Coach Charli Turner Thorne said. "And we
would also get away from so much head-to-head competition that we
don't get credit for.</TE>
<TE>   "When we are ranked and lose in conference, we fall out of the
rankings every time. The biggest way we can help ourselves is to get
away from the double round-robin and have more preseason
nonconference games. It would help our national image."</TE>
<TE>   Not every coach agrees, however.</TE>
<TE>   "At the beginning I was thinking of not having to play everyone
twice," UCLA Coach Kathy Olivier said. "But how do you do that? To be
the Pac-10 champion you need to play everyone twice. There are
formulas [to shorten the schedule], but it would be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still trying to figure what is the best solution. Hopefully
after this season we'll all sit down and figure out what is best for
the conference."</TE>
<TE>   This Is a Positive Attitude</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay Sotero will wrap up her college career this week when Cal
State Fullerton plays UC Santa Barbara and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
At 4-21 overall and 2-12 in conference, the Titans aren't expected to
go beyond the Big West tournament, if they qualify for it.</TE>
<TE>   It has been like that every season for Sotero, the only four-year
senior on Fullerton's team. Including this season, she has been on
the winning side 11 times in 95 games. Sotero's not a major star--the
5-foot-4 guard was always more adept at passing (220 assists) than
scoring (a 2.6 career average)--but who wants to keep banging her
head against a wall of futility?</TE>
<TE>   Born in Northridge and a graduate of North Hollywood High, Sotero,
22, thought briefly of leaving Fullerton after her freshman year. She
wouldn't have been alone: three players who were not seniors did bail
out under then-coach Denise Curry. But Sotero decided to stay, in
part because Fullerton offered her a scholarship a month before she
was to enroll at Ventura College.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew my education was first," said Sotero, who is on track to
graduate next year with a degree in kinesiology. "But I also stayed
because I had signed [the letter of intent] with the idea it was for
four years.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no regrets. My career has been the experience of a
lifetime. It gave me a chance to play Division I basketball, play
some top teams and learn about myself in life and in basketball."</TE>
<TE>   The best lesson? "The experience of knowing things don't come
easy. Sometimes even if the outcome isn't what you want, just knowing
you had the opportunity to make something out of the opportunity is
enough."</TE>
<TE>   NCAA May Pay Attention</TE>
<TE>   If the Pac-10 is able to get only three teams into the NCAA
tournament, and assuming the Southeastern, Big 12 and Big Ten don't
get more than their share, this may be a season in which the West
Coast Conference, which begins its postseason tournament Thursday,
can get more than one bid.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine, which won the regular-season championship, has 20 wins
and Santa Clara, which is seeded second, has 19. Both seem like
viable entries, especially if they wind up playing each other in the
Sunday championship game.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for Pepperdine is it has more significant losses than
victories, including close-but-no-cigar efforts against Stanford,
Illinois and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara, with wins over Washington and Utah, is a little
better off. But it still doesn't have the kind of nonconference
victory that would get the selection committee's attention.</TE>
<TE>   Which could doom the WCC to one NCAA bid--again.</TE>

<HD>Developer Hopes a Facelift Revives Dead Tri-Level</HD>
<DH>Design: Balancing the plaza's nightlife with the area's
historic ambience is key to the $3.5-million project across the
street from the mission in San Juan Capistrano.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Busk isn't looking to turn downtown San Juan Capistrano into
Carmel or Old Town Pasadena. But he would like to breathe a little
more life into the historic district where the sidewalks are
traditionally rolled up around sundown.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great place, it's got a lot of history," Busk said. "But
it needs ... a little more nightlife."</LD>
<LD>   Busk is the latest owner of downtown's biggest dead spot:
Franciscan Plaza, an uninviting Spanish-style tri-level across the
street from the 200-year-old mission and about 20 yards from the
picturesque train depot. A five-screen movie complex in the
45,000-square-foot plaza has been vacant for two years. Many of the
shops are gone.</LD>
<TE>   But Busk--the soured economy and a downsizing theater industry
notwithstanding--is betting about $3.5 million that the sleepy
Franciscan can be turned into a centerpiece for nighttime action in a
neighborhood of old adobes, small museums and gift shops.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the money will be poured into the multiplex, the center's
most obvious failure. Busk believes an upscale theater complex--he
plans to call it Mission Cinema De Luxe--will bring in the after-dark
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The theater's $1-million renovation is expected to be completed by
mid-May. The developer also plans two upscale restaurants with
outdoor seating, spruced-up quarters for an existing diner, an ice
cream shop and a makeover for the building's plaza. He's aiming to
have the work done by spring 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Busk had similar lofty plans in downtown Dana Point, where he
bought prime harbor-front property five years ago with a promise to
build a retail and office complex called Pizza del Violeta. The
project never took off.</TE>
<TE>   "There was supposed to be a lot of outdoor eating areas and
interaction between people sitting at the restaurants and those
walking through the plaza," said Ed Knight, Dana Point's community
development director. "You're always a little disappointed when
something you see as a winning project doesn't get built."</TE>
<TE>   Busk discussed two other commercial projects with Knight last
fall, the Villas at Dana Point and the Green Lantern Bed &amp; Breakfast.
So far, Busk has not submitted plans for either proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The developer said his first order of business in San Juan is to
change the center's karma. He can't move the building, but he can
change its name and appearance. When it reopens, it will be called
Mission Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   So far, city officials have been receptive to Busk's plans. Other
business owners have their doubts, however.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Nordeck, who owns the nearby Swallow's Inn tavern and once
tried to buy the plaza, said he would have demolished the theater
long ago and replaced it with a hotel or upscale shops.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody went to the theater," said Nordeck, who also owns the
district's Mission Promenade. "It was a ghost town. If I owned that
property, a theater is the last use I'd have for that building."</TE>
<TE>   Busk, who specializes in building custom homes, is the fourth
person to own the Franciscan in 12 years. Other grand dreams have
gone up in smoke, and until recently, Busk was among those who
thought the theater should just be torn down.</TE>
<TE>   Once Edwards Cinemas pulled out and no other chain was willing to
take over, Busk said he figured he had no option but to raze the
cinema. City officials and local residents, he said, helped change
his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I came to the conclusion that a theater is one of the retail
pillars of downtown," said Busk, who also owns an adjacent 350-space
parking structure and the Juan Avila adobe, one of the city's oldest
homes. "It creates a vibrancy for after-hours and evening hours."</TE>
<TE>   Busk plans to show first-run features in two of the theaters,
independent films in two others and foreign releases in a fifth. He
even envisions a touch of Hollywood in old San Juan.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping to roll out the red carpet from the train station to
the theater for independent film actors who come down here for
premieres," Busk said. "We'd like to shut down Verdugo Street for a
night, put up some bleachers and have a couple hundred people
greeting the stars."</TE>
<TE>   City officials said Busk needs to keep a sense of balance as he
moves forward. The town is proud of its historic downtown and
protective of its small-town charm.</TE>
<TE>   City Wants to Retain Appeal of Downtown</TE>
<TE>   "Downtown is appealing because of its history and its
pedestrian-friendly look," said Mayor Diane Bathgate. "And we want to
retain that."</TE>
<TE>   Busk said he understands the challenge. "Turning San Juan into a
tourist town isn't where we're at," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Stoffel, an Irvine-based shopping center and entertainment
consultant, said an art theater could help reawaken downtown San
Juan.</TE>
<TE>   "The independent and foreign films don't draw anywhere near as
many customers as the first-runs," Stoffel said. "But they do they
tend to draw better-educated and more affluent customers."</TE>
<TE>   Cities including Ventura, Burbank and Brea have used multiplex
theaters as a centerpiece for revitalization efforts. In San Juan's
case, Stoffel said, there is no competition in the immediate area.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a hole in the market for the time being," Stoffel said.
"It sounds like [Busk] is heading in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   City officials are optimistic, though cautiously so.</TE>
<TE>   "He definitely is a visionary," said Douglas Dumhart, manager of
the city's redevelopment agency. "That kind of dreamer might bring
some new interest into the town."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman David Swerdlin also sees potential in Busk's project.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he'll attract a younger crowd that has some money to
spend," Swerdlin said. "The outdoor dining will make a difference. It
builds a sense of community. The restaurant becomes a place where
people can see and be seen. It becomes an attraction."</TE>
<TE>   Swallow's Inn Owner Says He Has His Doubts</TE>
<TE>   Busk is financing most of the project, though he is seeking
financial assistance from the city's redevelopment agency for
lighting and landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to cooperate and assist where we can," Dumhart said. "We
see the plaza as a precious asset. It's a cornerstone area, and we
need it to be successful."</TE>
<TE>   Nordeck said he has his doubts, but he wishes his business
neighbor well.</TE>
<TE>   "I admire Busk's tenacity, and I hope I'm wrong about this,"
Nordeck said. "I would love to see a success story over there."</TE>

<HD>15 Charged in Alleged Gang-Related Killing</HD>
<DH>Crime: The suspects, six of them juveniles, are accused of
stabbing a man in Canyon Country last month in revenge for an earlier
slaying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fifteen alleged gang members, including six juveniles, have been
charged in last month's beating and fatal stabbing of a man in Canyon
Country, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   All but one were charged with one count of murder with the special
circumstance of lying in wait and one count of conspiracy to commit
murder. The other defendant was charged with being an accessory after
the fact.</LD>
<LD>   Byron Benito, 19, was beaten and stabbed repeatedly in what
authorities said was the defendants' retaliation for a killing
earlier that day.</LD>
<TE>   No decision has been made about seeking the death penalty for the
adult defendants. The district attorney's office has asked that the
juveniles be tried as adults, though they could not face the death
penalty because the incident occurred before they turned 18. If
convicted, the juveniles could face life imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   The names of the juvenile defendants were not released. The adult
defendants are: Randy Franco, 21, of Canyon Country; Alfredo
Hernandez, 22, of Sylmar; Katherine Mary Henson, 21, of Granada
Hills; Samuel Herr, 18, of Canyon Country; Jorge Luis Manrique, 18,
of Canyon Country; Robert Moreno Jr., 20, of Canyon Country; John
Perez Romero, 20, of Saugus; Jose De Jesus Rodriguez, 20, of Canyon
Country; and Roger Patrick Villasenor, 21, of Canyon Country.</TE>

<HD>Parks, Hoffman Battle for Title of Nature's Guardian</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the leafy affluence that is Thousand Oaks, a political candidate
needs to remember one thing: Always embrace the environment by
protecting the oak trees, ridgelines and open spaces that distinguish
this city.</LD>
<LD>   Councilwoman Linda Parks was weaned on that truism; her rival in
the supervisorial race, Randy Hoffman, is learning it fast.</LD>
<LD>   The activist politician and the millionaire businessman want to
replace retiring Frank Schillo as the Ventura County supervisor
representing Thousand Oaks. Each claims to be best qualified to keep
the county's farmlands and open spaces from being paved over.</LD>
<TE>   The 45-year-old Parks has made a name for herself in a strident
debate over growth that has marked City Council politics for more
than a decade. And she says her long record of preserving Thousand
Oaks' natural environment should assure voters she's a guardian they
can count on.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the real thing and I have the track record to prove it,"
Parks said. "It's like he's putting on a wig and trying to say he's
Linda Parks. He has nothing to base his claims on."</TE>
<TE>   But Hoffman thinks his support of the county's popular anti-sprawl
SOAR initiatives should be considered, along with his ability to work
with people of all stripes, including those with whom he disagrees.
The 48-year entrepreneur thinks his leadership style sets him apart
from Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "She's an attacker and she's a divider," he said. "I am somebody
who builds consensus, who is responsible and who hammers out
solutions. In the world today, the 'my-way-or-the-highway' approach
that Linda Parks uses doesn't work."</TE>
<TE>   The March 5 primary will decide who represents a district that
includes Oak Park, portions of Westlake Village and the coastal areas
north of Malibu. But most of its voters reside in Thousand Oaks, and
that city's brass-knuckle politics are factoring heavily in the race.</TE>
<TE>   To understand where the battle lines are drawn, one need look no
further than the candidates' supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Both are Republican, but Hoffman is getting more money and
endorsements from business leaders, law enforcement and conservative
Republican groups. Residents who favor slow growth but are turned off
by what they perceive as Parks' "NIMBY" tactics are also expected to
back Hoffman.</TE>
<TE>   Developer David H. Murdock is Hoffman's biggest contributor,
giving $91,000 to his campaign so far. Murdock has said he is backing
Hoffman because he would be more hospitable to business than his
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Sizable donations by other area business owners have fattened
Hoffman's campaign treasury. He has raised $380,000, compared with
$106,000 for Parks, who is limiting donations to $500 per individual.
Parks, meanwhile, is backed by a network of slow-growth advocates who
believe that the city bows to business too much while ignoring the
concerns of residents. They say they can trust Parks to hold the line
on their top concern--urban sprawl--even in the face of intense
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Devoted to their candidate, many of Parks' volunteers commit
enormous time and energy helping her win elections. In her last City
Council race, Parks led a field of seven, tallying the highest number
of votes ever for a municipal candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The councilwoman, who switched her party registration from
Democrat to Republican before her first election six years ago, is
also backed by environmental groups and several Democratic
politicians and activists, including Hollywood director Rob Reiner.</TE>
<TE>   The heated divisions on display at the City Council's "Tuesday
Night Fights" have spilled over into the supervisor's race. In recent
weeks, both camps have traded accusations of secret deals and
influence-peddling.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' supporters accuse Murdock of backing Hoffman so the
developer can push through more housing in bucolic Hidden Valley.
Hoffman has called the charge ridiculous and Murdock has dismissed
it.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock in turn has all but called Parks a hypocrite, insisting
that she asked for his financial support last year. Parks flatly
denies that.</TE>
<TE>   And 20 days before the election, a majority of Thousand Oaks City
Council members voted to censure Parks for allegedly arranging for
the city Planning Commission to delay a vote on a politically
sensitive development deal, a charge Parks denies. The split council
also voted to refer the matter to the district attorney's office for
possible violations of the state's public meeting laws and booted two
planning commissioners off the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' supporters say the council majority--Dennis Gillette, Dan
Del Campo and Andy Fox--favors Hoffman and is using the censure to
sully Parks' reputation. The councilmen dismiss those charges as
untrue, and Hoffman denies he was involved with the censure decision.</TE>
<TE>   Parks says her opponents are slinging mud because they fear her.
She has built her slow-growth reputation by consistently voting
against major development projects, usually arguing that the city
wanted to give away too much money and other concessions.</TE>
<TE>   She prides herself on her watchdog nature, and--with a master's
degree in urban planning--her ability to digest complex land-use
issues.</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of a San Fernando Valley voice actor and a homemaker,
she emerged in local politics shortly after moving from Woodland
Hills to Thousand Oaks in 1989. Her first target was the 3,050-home
Ahmanson Ranch development planned for the county's eastern edge.</TE>
<TE>   Although the development was approved by the Board of Supervisors
in 1993, its construction has been delayed by lawsuits, and opponents
are again sharpening knives to see it defeated. Parks has pledged to
continue battling the planned mini-city if she is elected.</TE>
<TE>   Parks served as a planning commissioner prior to being elected to
the City Council in 1996. She was reelected to a second term in 2000,
when her closest ally, lawyer Ed Masry, was also elected.</TE>
<TE>   The two have tangled repeatedly with the council majority and have
accused the city's staff of giving them biased information on
projects. Homeowners who believe their voices are not being heard
have applauded the two as champions of the underdog.</TE>
<TE>   But others see their tactics as obstructive, with no real purpose
other than to generate headlines.</TE>
<TE>   At the county level, Parks said she would continue efforts to
permanently preserve open space and to hold the line on sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   Her other priorities would be keeping funding levels for the
county's public safety departments intact, steering more dollars
toward services for the elderly and pushing for a new private
hospital in the east end of the Conejo Valley.</TE>
<TE>   She'd also be a fiscal hawk, Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   "I voted against the [Thousand Oaks city] budget one year because
it included $17 million to study a golf course in Hill Canyon, and I
felt that was a waste of money," she said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Hoffman says politics is something he has considered
since grade school.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in a household dominated by an abusive, alcoholic
stepfather motivated him to set a different course, Hoffman said. He
worked several jobs while growing up in Orange County and earned
scholarships to attend USC and, later, Harvard business school before
launching a corporate career.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, he co-founded Magellan Systems, a company that
manufactures satellite tracking devices used in cars and military
equipment. After the company grew from five employees to 500 in a
decade, Hoffman sold his stake and ran for Congress in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He lost to Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) but notes that he tallied
more votes than the incumbent in the Ventura County portion of the
24th District. He decided to run for county supervisor, he says,
because his years in business, and the fortune he made, have given
him the skills and the means to give back to society.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm my own person," he said. "I know where I came from. I know
what I have done. I am fortunate that I am able to run for public
office and give back and maintain my independence."</TE>
<TE>   As supervisor, he would use his business background to toughen
financial accountability among county departments, Hoffman said. That
means calling managers before the Board of Supervisors each quarter
to report on whether they are staying on budget, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he'd also protect the budgets of the sheriff and district
attorney to make sure the county's reputation for low crime
continues.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents have attacked Hoffman's business savvy in recent days
amid revelations that one of his business ventures is in financial
trouble, leaving a trail of debts. Critics also accuse Hoffman of
paying lip service to growth control because it would be political
suicide to do otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   If he really meant what he says, opponents say, he would not
accept contributions from developers. Hoffman dismisses that notion
as misguided.</TE>
<TE>   "When I worked at Magellan, I made a decision to drive 65 miles a
day to San Dimas because my wife and I loved the Thousand Oaks area,"
he said. "It is where we are raising our kids. Why would I want to
change what drew us here in the first place?"</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Hoffman was praised by Reiner and other Ahmanson Ranch
opponents when he called on the Board of Supervisors to order a new
environmental analysis of the project, saying previous studies are
outdated.</TE>
<TE>   "Rob Reiner and Chris Albrecht, the leaders of [Ahmanson
opposition group] Rally for the Ranch, know me and recognize my
sincere and total opposition to Ahmanson Ranch," Hoffman said. "As a
resident of the Conejo Valley, you would have to be insane to want to
put another 50,000 car trips on the 101 Freeway."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman is backed by many in the district's Republican
establishment who view Parks as a liberal environmentalist who took
on the Republican mantle to get elected in the conservative district.</TE>
<TE>   Schillo said he is endorsing Hoffman to replace him because the
businessman hews closer to the party's core conservative principles.</TE>
<TE>   "This district is concerned about where their tax dollars go,"
Schillo said. "They don't expect environmental services from the
county of Ventura."</TE>
<TE>   Parks challenged the notion that she is out of step with a
majority of the district's voters, whom she described as
environmental-leaning Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of people here are Republicans, but the majority are
in favor of slow-growth," she said. "It's not an oxymoron."</TE>

<LD>A former senior auditor for the Times Mirror Co. pleaded guilty in
federal court Monday to illegal insider trading tied to the company's
acquisition by the Tribune Co.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel J. Wooten III, 38, of Torrance netted nearly $77,000 in
profits by buying 2,285 shares of Times Mirror stock in March 2000,
after receiving confidential information about the impending
takeover.</LD>
<LD>   Under terms of a plea agreement, prosecutors will recommend that
Wooten be placed on three years' probation, serving the first six
months under home detention.</LD>
<TE>   He would also have to surrender his stock trading profits and pay
a $3,000 fine, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. David Seide.</TE>

<HD>Woman Pleads Guilty in Cyber-Stalking Case</HD>
<DH>Court: The Simi Valley resident admits creating a Web site
to embarrass a married Las Vegas man who ended their affair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Las Vegas topless dancer has pleaded guilty to felony
stalking for creating a Web site that featured sexually explicit
photos of her former lover.</LD>
<LD>   Robin Kelly, now a Simi Valley resident, surprised prosecutors
last week by changing her previous not-guilty plea and admitting she
had harassed the married man.</LD>
<LD>   "She pleaded guilty to attempted extortion and two counts of
stalking," Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Temple said. "And
she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of witness intimidation."</LD>
<TE>   Kelly, 43, has no criminal record and is expected to be placed on
probation when she is sentenced next month.</TE>
<TE>   Temple said he will ask that the terms of probation specify that
she not be allowed to use a computer or the Internet. Deputy Public
Defender Denise McPeak said she would oppose any blanket order
prohibiting computer use.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, Kelly, who danced under the name
"Ruby Tuesday," began harassing Jim Day, an editorial cartoonist for
the Las Vegas Review-Journal, after he ended their seven-year affair
in April 2000.</TE>
<TE>   For months, she made annoying phone calls and sent threatening
letters and e-mail, before setting up a Web site that featured
photographs of their sexual trysts, police testified. The site
included photographs of Day's cars and a map with directions to his
Las Vegas home.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly also sent postcards advertising the site to his family,
neighbors and co-workers. The site has been taken down by court
order.</TE>
<TE>   Before her arrest, Kelly told police she never intended to harm
anyone. She said she only wanted an apology from Day.</TE>
<TE>   Her case is believed to be the first of its kind in Ventura County
because electronic communications have only recently been included in
state stalking laws.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, who was arrested in November, remains at a Ventura County
jail in lieu of $200,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>County Looks to Sign New Lease on Life for Fisherman's
Wharf</HD>
<DH>Business: Board is expected to advance its effort to
reclaim rental property at Channel Islands Harbor, with hopes of
refurbishing it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ambitious plans to revitalize Channel Islands Harbor near Oxnard will
take a crucial step forward today if Ventura County supervisors, as
expected, approve a final round of negotiations to reclaim possession
of the Fisherman's Wharf area.</LD>
<LD>   After years of rising revenue, business at the 316-acre harbor
flagged in the mid-1990s. Some businesses went bankrupt, and the
county has had a difficult time attracting new tenants because the
40-year-old marina needs an overhaul, said Lyn Krieger, manager of
the county-run harbor.</LD>
<LD>   Fisherman's Wharf, a five-acre complex of shops and restaurants,
is a good starting point because of its high-profile location at
Victoria Avenue and Channel Islands Boulevard, Krieger said.</LD>
<TE>   The county has been negotiating to buy out long-term leases held
by Westbrook Real Estate Partners for nearly two years, she said. But
before a deal is struck, the county needs to look at Westbrook's
financial records, and the real estate group is requesting a
confidentiality agreement before it will proceed, Krieger said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors are expected to approve the secrecy agreement at their
board meeting today.</TE>
<TE>   County officials are looking to mix in more thoughtful
development, conceding that the often empty mishmash of shops and
eateries now surrounding the harbor evolved without a clear plan.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998 the supervisors adopted a revitalization blueprint that,
among other things, called for transforming Fisherman's Wharf into a
trendy, upscale shopping center modeled after the highly successful
Promenade at Westlake in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Krieger said the county would be looking for another "catalytic
project" to spur transformation of the harbor's west side. But much
of the county's far-reaching plans depend on the willingness of
leaseholders to redevelop or to sell their rights, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In that regard, Westbrook is a major player. The company owns
about one-third of the property leases at the harbor, including the
Casa Sirena hotel, Lobster Trap restaurant and two apartment
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Some tenants at Fisherman's Wharf allege that Westbrook has done
little to help turn around business, allowing properties to fall into
disrepair.</TE>
<TE>   "These last six years that they've owned it, things have just slid
downhill," said JoAnna Steele, who has operated an art gallery and
framing shop at Fisherman's Wharf for 23 years. "It's neglect of
landscaping, of cleaning and of relationships with tenants."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Westbrook did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor John Flynn, whose district includes the harbor, said
the county intends to reclaim the leases and then ask developers to
make proposals. The negotiations have taken a long time, Flynn said,
because "it has to be done just right."</TE>
<TE>   "The deterioration has caused a lot of harm to the county. There
is nothing vibrant going on down there," he said. "The Lobster Trap
used to gross $6 million a year. Now it's about half of that. All of
the businesses have been hurt by this gradual slide."</TE>
<TE>   Krieger said that despite higher vacancies, the county's revenue
from rents is growing at an estimated 7% a year. Still, the harbor
would benefit from a better mix of commercial and recreational
attractions and by adding more office space, she said.</TE>
<TE>   That approach worked well at Shoreline Village in Long Beach, a
shopping and restaurant mecca on the water near the Queen Mary and
Long Beach Aquarium. Property manager Cecilia Charky said the center
has 100% occupancy after falling to as low as 70% in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   New owners brought in a manager who sliced rents, added office
space now filled with attorneys, artists and graphic designers, and
repainted the shops in bright colors, Charky said.</TE>
<TE>   "The secret was to give tenants really low rent rates to come in,"
she said. "You can't drag someone into a dead zone and expect them to
flourish. And rent rates are now at a competitive level because it is
so successful."</TE>

<LD>The Department of Energy has extended until April 26 the deadline for
the public to respond to its plans to clean up and close a former
nuclear research facility at Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field
Laboratory.</LD>
<LD>   The deadline had been Monday but was extended after demands from
anti-nuclear activists and elected officials who are concerned the
proposed plan would not have high enough standards.</LD>
<LD>   Copies of the cleanup plan may be obtained from the Energy
Department's Web site at www.oak .doe.gov or calling (510) 637-1762.

<HD>Americans With HIV Estimated at 1 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE
</DL>
<LD>As many as 1 million Americans are now living with HIV infections
and about half are undiagnosed or untreated, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said here Monday.</LD>
<LD>   AIDS death rates in the U.S. have declined sharply because of
successful therapies. As recently as 1996, the last year before new
combinations of drugs began prolonging survival, there were 38,025 AIDS
deaths reported. By 2000, 15,245 people died. At the same time, however,
the number of Americans becoming newly infected has remained stubbornly
steady at about 40,000 each year.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the number of people living with the virus that causes
the disease is now increasing by about 25,000 a year, bringing the total
number of people infected to an all-time high.</LD>
<TE>   Based on some random testing and statistical analyses, the CDC
estimates that about a quarter of those infected do not know they have
the disease, which puts them at the highest risk for spreading the
illness. That proportion has declined in recent years. In 1998, about a
third of those who were infected had not been diagnosed, the CDC
estimates. The existence of effective therapies for AIDS has encouraged
people to get tested.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even when people know they are infected, about a third are not
being treated, epidemiologist Patricia Fleming told the ninth annual
Retrovirus Conference here.</TE>
<TE>   "A major part of what we are trying to do at CDC is to get people
tested," said Dr. Harold Jaffe, director of the CDC's National Center for
HIV, Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Tuberculosis Prevention. The CDC,
he noted, is starting a major new public education drive to encourage
more testing.</TE>
<TE>   Some people are being dissuaded from testing by continuing reports of
adverse effects from antiviral therapy, said Dr. Constance Benson of the
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.</TE>
<TE>   "That really resulted in people feeling that maybe they don't want to
be in therapy, so that there is no reason to be tested," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But therapy remains very effective, she added, and has kept the death
rate low despite the complications associated with the drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "The take-home message is that there are more people living with HIV
than ever before, there are too many who are diagnosed too late, and
there are an unacceptable number not receiving treatment and services,"
Jaffe said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the latest figures on the course of the AIDS
epidemic--estimates that have been revised over the years--about 400,000
to 450,000 Americans were infected with the disease in 1984. By 1986, the
number had grown to 550,000 to 650,000. By 1992, the figure was 650,000
to 900,000.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming and her colleagues used data from the 25 states that have
extensive HIV and AIDS reporting to estimate that the total number of
Americans living with HIV increased by about 25,000 a year from 1998 to
2000, bringing the total in 2000 to between 850,000 to 950,000.</TE>
<TE>   On the reasonable assumption that the growth has remained constant
during the last two years, the total is now nearing 900,000 to 1 million.</TE>
<TE>   In another report, CDC officials noted that when AIDS victims do die,
fewer are dying from such conditions as tuberculosis and pneumocystic
pneumonia, which have been considered defining characteristics of AIDS. A
higher percentage are dying from liver and kidney disease, the report
showed.</TE>
<TE>   The shift in causes of death is probably due to several factors, said
the CDC's Dr. Mitchell I. Wolfe. Some of the drugs used to treat HIV
infections can produce kidney and liver damage, Wolfe noted, so at least
some of the increase may be attributable to such complications. But
because effective drug treatments mean people can live longer with AIDS
than before, the average age of the population with AIDS is increasing,
he said, and both kidney and liver diseases are more common in the
elderly.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfe and his colleagues studied causes of death in six U.S.
cities--including Los Angeles--before 1996 and afterward.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest drops in the causes of death came in tuberculosis and
non-TB mycobacterial infections. Before 1996, TB accounted for 4.4% of
AIDS deaths; afterward, it represented only 1.9%. Similarly, the
proportion of deaths from non-TB mycobacterial infections fell from 14.3%
to 9.2%. Pneumocystis pneumonia also declined, from 10.6% to 6.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfe attributed these declines to better treatments for the
infections and to the stronger immune systems of patients receiving
combination therapies for HIV.</TE>
<TE>   Other causes of death, including non-pneumocystis pneumonia and
Kaposi's sarcoma, showed no change.</TE>
<TE>   But deaths due to kidney and liver diseases jumped significantly. The
proportion of deaths resulting from kidney disease rose from 8.0% to
10.3%, while that of liver disease climbed from 5.4% to 8.1%.</TE>
<TE>   The proportion of deaths from wasting and non-Hodgkins lymphoma also
rose during the period, for reasons that are not clear.</TE>

<HD>Riordan, Simon Tied in Volatile GOP Primary</HD>
<DH>Poll: Ex-mayor's big lead vanishes in barrage of negative ads by
Gov. Davis. Low turnout could favor Simon, the clear choice of
conservatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Battered by a wave of negative advertising, Richard Riordan has
fallen from the lead and now runs dead even with Bill Simon Jr. as the
Republican race for governor enters its final week, according to a Los
Angeles Times poll.</LD>
<LD>   Simon has emerged as the clear favorite of GOP conservatives, pushing
Bill Jones into a distant third place. With his firm support among the
party base, Simon could benefit the most if a low turnout next Tuesday
enhances the influence of Republican activists.</LD>
<LD>   On the Democratic side, incumbent Gray Davis' unusual strategy of
intervening in the GOP primary by targeting Riordan with a barrage of
negative TV spots has clearly made a difference.</LD>
<TE>   His approval ratings are still anemic, but Davis now runs ahead of all
three GOP contestants among registered voters in a prospective fall
matchup. Last month, he ran even with Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Although he received much of the blame for the sharply negative tone
of the gubernatorial contest, Davis' overall favorable impression has not
suffered. The governor faces no serious opposition in the Democratic
race.</TE>
<TE>   With just seven days of campaigning left, the contest remains
volatile, and a substantial percentage of voters are still undecided. But
the survey, conducted Wednesday through Sunday, offered few bright spots
for Riordan, the former mayor of Los Angeles who was coaxed into the race
by the White House and has been viewed as the prohibitive front-runner
until now.</TE>
<TE>   A central argument of his candidacy--that he would be the most
formidable candidate against Davis--is undermined by the survey, which
finds that millionaire businessman Simon now runs equally strong against
the incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Riordan's repeated assertions that Republicans should
moderate the party's stance on issues, such as abortion rights, to
improve its chances in November is soundly rejected--52% to 40%--by
likely GOP primary voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Either you're pro-choice or pro-life. There's nothing in between,"
said Thad Luyben, a 44-year-old Yorba Linda funeral director, who has
soured on Riordan because he seems to be "teeter-tottering back and
forth."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Riordan's lead in the GOP primary has shrunk dramatically in
the last month, when he enjoyed a double-digit edge over Simon and
Secretary of State Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan and Simon now run neck-and-neck among likely Republican
primary voters, with 31% support for each when a moderate turnout is
projected. Jones received 14%, and 22% of those surveyed were undecided.</TE>
<TE>   Under a projected low turnout, Simon had 29% support, Riordan 26% and
Jones 11%, with the rest undecided.</TE>
<TE>TV Ads Play Big Role for Voters</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the most important factor in this media-centric
state has been the blitz of advertisements filling the television
airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly eight in 10 likely Republican primary voters said they had seen
or heard at least some of the advertising in the race. The bulk of the
spots has targeted Riordan, and the criticism of the erstwhile
front-runner has clearly taken a toll.</TE>
<TE>   Just about half of likely GOP primary voters, 54%, had a positive
impression of the former Los Angeles mayor, down from 63% in January.
More significant, the 30% who viewed Riordan unfavorably was almost
double the percentage that had a negative opinion a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I had more positive thoughts when the campaign first began than I do
now," said 64-year-old Donna Reich of San Francisco, who has moved into
the Simon camp because of the advertising attacks on Riordan. "He just
comes across to me as sincere and not too political," Reich said of
Simon.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Palisades financier has been mostly positive in his
advertisements, save for a spot that began airing at the end of last
week. That ad was a response to an attack by Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   In the last month, Simon's image has improved steadily, with 55% now
viewing the first-time candidate positively and only 8% holding a
negative view. About a third of likely GOP voters are still unaware of
Simon, who is making his first try for public office.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the generally warm feelings toward Simon have translated into
a more positive assessment of how he would deal with specific issues
facing the state.</TE>
<TE>   In last month's survey, Riordan received the highest marks among
likely Republican voters on the issues of public education, crime, the
economy and which candidate was best equipped to handle the state's
energy situation.</TE>
<TE>   But in the latest poll, Simon was picked as the one who could do the
best job on the economy and energy. He ran even with Riordan on handling
education.</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor was still ahead on the question of who could best
fight crime, and he led Simon when it came to which candidate knows more
about the issues affecting California.</TE>
<TE>   "I support Riordan because he was mayor of a large city," said Allen
Clark, an 81-year-old Sacramento retiree. "I just feel he's more
experienced."</TE>
<TE>   For Jones, a far-off third in the GOP race, it is truly a case of out
of sight, out of mind. Able to afford only a minimal TV advertising
presence, the outgoing secretary of state is still unknown to roughly
half of likely Republican primary voters. His 40% to 9%
favorable-unfavorable rating is virtually unchanged from a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, his low standing in polls and fund-raising threaten to
become self-perpetuating. "He seems like a great guy," said Robert W.
Cole, a 50-year-old lifelong Republican from Redlands. "But I just don't
think he has the financial horsepower to compete."</TE>
<TE>   For a time, Jones vied with Simon to emerge as the champion of the
GOP's conservative core. But Simon has clearly consolidated that support.
Take two litmus tests: Among likely Republican primary voters opposed to
legal abortion, Simon led with 36% support to 25% for Riordan and just
13% for Jones.</TE>
<TE>   On gun control, Simon won 40% support among likely Republican primary
voters who oppose stiffer regulation of firearms, compared with 21% for
Riordan and 17% for Jones.</TE>
<TE>   As for November's general election, incumbent Davis still faces
weakness in his Democratic base. Just under half, 44%, of likely voters
in his party's primary said they would not support the governor or were
considering another candidate for November--unchanged from last month.</TE>
<TE>   However, unlike the last two primaries, the vote next Tuesday will not
allow dissenters to cross party lines. In the partisan races,
participation will be limited to registered voters of each party with one
exception: decline-to-state voters can choose to participate in either
the Democratic or Republican primaries.</TE>
<TE>Davis' Approval Rating Is Unchanged</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Davis' job approval is a middling 47% among registered
voters, unchanged from last month. He continues to receive poor marks on
his stewardship of the state, with 49% saying Davis has failed to act as
a decisive leader.</TE>
<TE>   But even though he receives the highest share of blame for the
negative tone of the governor's race--just about a third of registered
voters hold Davis responsible--he has been spared any significant
backlash. Overall, 50% of registered voters had a favorable impression of
Davis, virtually unchanged from a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   In a prospective November horse race, Jones and Simon still lose to
Davis among registered voters, but each gained ground. Davis beat Simon
45% to 37% and topped Jones 46% to 36%. In January, the governor led both
of them by 18 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, the candidate who has touted himself as the one Davis fears
most, actually slipped in the last month.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the two ran essentially even, with Davis at 44% and
Riordan at 43%. In the latest survey, Davis pulled ahead 47% to 39% among
registered voters.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the race for governor, California voters will decide a
number of other contests next week, as well as a handful of ballot
initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing a description, nearly two in three likely voters said
they support Proposition 40, a $2.6-billion bond measure to improve the
environment and preserve open space.</TE>
<TE>   Opinions were much more narrowly divided on Proposition 45, which
seeks to amend the state's legislative term limits law to give incumbents
a chance to extend their stay in office. Among likely voters, 43%
supported the proposal and a like number were opposed; that represents a
decline from a poll last month, when 48% of likely voters supported the
revision.</TE>
<TE>   In other races, the survey found the most hard-fought contests were
still wide open.</TE>
<TE>   Former Secretary of State March Fong Eu was leading the Democratic
primary to win back her old job, with 29% support, followed by
businesswoman Michela Alioto with 12% and Assemblyman Kevin Shelley of
San Francisco with 9%. About half the likely Democratic primary voters
were undecided.</TE>
<TE>   On the Republican side, former Assemblyman Keith Olberg of Victorville
had 15% support, to 13% for attorney Mike Schaefer and 10% for voting
rights analyst Barbara Jean Marr. More than 60% of likely GOP primary
voters had yet to make up their minds.</TE>
<TE>   In the Democratic race for controller, businessman Steve Westly was
leading Johan Klehs, a member of the state Board of Equalization, 36% to
10%. Just over half the likely voters were undecided in that contest.</TE>
<TE>   On the Republican side, state Sen. Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks had
25% support, followed by 13% for Board of Equalization member Dean Andal,
11% for businesswoman Nancy Beecham and 6% for business controller W.
Snow Hume. More than two in five of likely Republican primary voters were
undecided in the race for controller.</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll, under the direction of Susan Pinkus, interviewed 1,398
registered voters Feb. 20-24. There were 681 likely voters, including 378
likely Democratic primary voters and 243 likely Republican primary
voters.</TE>
<TE>   The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3
percentage points. For likely voters it is 4 points, for likely
Democratic primary voters it is 5 points, and for likely Republican
primary voters it is 6 points.</TE>

American society.
</SE>
<AU>TERENCE MONMANEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maria Erspamer loaded the big white rental truck with her
belongings, stowed her cats, Pumpkin and Foxy, and slid onto the
passenger seat next to an old friend. Then they headed east on the Santa
Monica Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles was soon in the rearview mirror. Erspamer felt giddy. She
had liked being a free-lance advertising writer and novice surfer, liked
her funky digs three blocks from the ocean in Venice, liked her clever,
irony-armored entertainment industry friends.</LD>
<LD>   Yet something was lacking, and Erspamer, single and 30, was hardly
aware of it until Sept. 11. Now, 2 1/2 months later, she was going home.</LD>
<TE>   "My priorities changed after the tragedy," she said. "Before, I was
more concerned with myself and my career. After, I couldn't see anything
more important than being with my family."</TE>
<TE>   Her decision to return to Phoenix and reunite with her two brothers,
mother and father, who is in his 80s and has prostate cancer, grew out of
"a hole in my sense of security and in my trust of what will happen in
the future," she said.</TE>
<TE>   That sense of vulnerability may be the most important emotional legacy
of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The unease surfaced immediately after 9/11 in a burst of praying,
volunteering, blood-giving and flag-waving. Sales of guns, Bibles,
self-help manuals and anti-anxiety medications surged. Many people felt
depressed. Some avoided flying; others, skyscrapers. A number of New York
City and Washington, D.C., residents left for what they believed would be
safer ground in smaller cities or rural towns.</TE>
<TE>   But the legions of social scientists, folklorists and others probing
Americans' varied responses to the attacks have also found a rise in
teamwork and gratitude, an easing of cynicism, and an unusually high
level of trust among Americans across racial and ethnic lines--a finding
that appears to belie predictions that the attacks would breed
intolerance.</TE>
<TE>   Five months later, the question is whether any of those responses will
persist long enough to leave a mark on the national character, much as
the Depression bred a new frugality and wariness and World War II
inspired a renewal of civic spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Some scholars speculate that 9/11 won't change Americans in the long
run unless additional terrorist attacks revive the original fear and
anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   "Trauma, whatever its intensity, has a major impact on one's life only
if there are reminders of it," said Shlomo Breznitz, a psychologist at
the University of Haifa in Israel and an authority on living amid violent
conflict. "And for this, it's too soon to tell."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Putnam, a Harvard University social historian, said the
increase in trust and generosity among Americans probably won't last
unless the government and private organizations reinforce it with new or
expanded civic responsibilities and volunteer opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush sought to do just that in his State of the Union
address, proposing a major expansion of the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps and
other volunteer service programs.</TE>
<TE>   What made Pearl Harbor such a galvanizing event, Putnam said, were the
rubber and scrap metal drives, the victory gardens and war bonds that
harnessed people's natural inclination to pitch in.</TE>
<TE>   "Leaving aside the possibility of some new trauma," he said, "if we
don't do something affirmatively to keep this mood alive by
institutionalizing it, I think it will disappear."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the events of September by themselves show signs of influencing a
great many lives. By destroying a shared and cherished belief in the
nation's unassailability, the tragedy may engender ways of thinking and
behaving that will be recognizable one day as rooted in 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no going back to normal," said Mel Cummings, 50, an assistant
architect in Brooklyn. "We'll always have this in the back of our mind,
always be edgy over what can happen in a split second. You're not in
control of your destiny. When thousands die instantly like that, it
brings that point right to the surface."</TE>
<TE>Americans Reexamine Their Priorities</TE>
<TE>   David Spiegel, a Stanford University psychiatrist, has gathered
information from more than 7,000 people responding to an Internet
questionnaire about the effects of the attacks. The responses, he said,
make clear that many people are reexamining priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "What were we, as a nation, preoccupied with before 9/11?" Spiegel
asked. "Mostly making money and the sex life of the former president. Now
both of those things seem trivial."</TE>
<TE>   A hallmark of the crisis is how it has prompted people such as Maria
Erspamer to redirect themselves. In a Los Angeles Times survey of 1,995
adults in mid-November, about 25% said the disaster was transforming
their lives for the better. They reported spending more time with family
members, expressing patriotic feelings and having a clearer sense of what
matters most.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving L.A. and rumbling 370 miles along Interstate 10,
Erspamer arrived in Phoenix late at night. The next day was
Thanksgiving--an apt beginning, she said, for a family reunion.</TE>
<TE>   She had lived in L.A. seven years. She'd been thinking about leaving
ever since her father's cancer was diagnosed last spring. The attacks
crystallized that longing.</TE>
<TE>   Erspamer has a new job in Phoenix. She misses her L.A. friends, she
said, but has no regrets.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know how much time you have. That was the most significant
thing I took away from Sept. 11. I want to make the most of every day,
and it's not enough to fly home to my family every few months. I want to
be with them and share their daily experience."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Americans' anxiety may not be as acute as it was five months
ago, but specialists in risk analysis say that worry about possible
future attacks will persist and will continue to cause stress-related
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "That a few determined people could produce such massive harm and
destruction on a great nation such as ours was very unsettling," said
Paul Slovic, a psychologist at the University of Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   A fear that can be pictured, like the TV images of the jets crashing
into the World Trade Center and the buildings collapsing, is generally
more powerful than one that can't be, he said. Adding to the anxiety, he
said, is the enemies' elusiveness and the possibility of more attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Since 9/11, Americans have been improvising ways to reduce the odds of
becoming victims, from shunning crowds to washing their hands after
opening the mail.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not such measures are truly protective, it's important for
individuals to do something, if only to avoid feeling helpless, said
Jerilyn Ross, president of the Anxiety Disorders Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Hill, a 24-year-old Web site developer in Missoula, Mont., had
looked forward to moving to San Francisco. She was driving there Sept.
11. On hearing the news about the attacks on New York and the Pentagon,
she turned back.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't seem like a great idea to move to a major metropolitan area
right then," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Chastain, a 40-year-old mother of three in Athens, Ala., has
stocked up on food and forbidden her teenage daughter to hang around a
nearby mall, which she vaguely worries is a possible terrorist target.</TE>
<TE>   Chastain said that is not the only way the attacks have affected her.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess every generation has an event that changes it, like the
Depression was for my grandparents," she said. "I am not the same person
I was before Sept. 11. I think I'll be more cautious and have more of a
global view. Before, I didn't think much about what was happening in
other parts of the world."</TE>
<TE>Written Tributes Show a Remarkable Unity</TE>
<TE>   Written tributes left around New York City after Sept. 11 expressed
grief, rage and a desire for revenge. But mostly, said folklorist Steve
Zeitlin, who has been documenting 9/11 artifacts, they voiced a
remarkable unity.</TE>
<TE>   An anonymous poem at one shrine said in part:</TE>
<TE>   As the soot and ash rained down,</TE>
<TE>   We became one color.</TE>
<TE>   As we carried each other down the stairs of the burning building,</TE>
<TE>   We became one class.</TE>
<TE>   As we lit candles of waiting and hope,</TE>
<TE>   We became one generation.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence abounds of an outpouring of fellow-feeling not seen in this
nation for decades. In an unintended experiment, psychologists Martin
Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania and Christopher Peterson of
the University of Michigan showed that several virtues bloomed after the
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   In June, they posted on the Web (at http://www.positivepsychology.org)
a questionnaire that seeks to measure 24 character strengths, such as
curiosity, fairness, forgiveness and love of learning. It was part of an
effort by the two psychologists to focus their profession on virtues as
well as pathologies. Anyone age 18 or older was invited to respond to the
316 questions about personal outlook, habits and preferences.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, more than 450 people filled out the questionnaire;
since then, more than 600 have done so.</TE>
<TE>   After the attacks, the responses showed people placing a greater value
on six qualities: love, gratitude, hope, kindness, spirituality and
teamwork.</TE>
<TE>   "In a nutshell, everything that has to do with relating to other
people went up," Peterson said. Women usually place more value than men
on "interpersonal strengths," he said, but after Sept. 11, men were
responsible for the new emphasis on these qualities.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, by mid-December, test results showed the enthusiasm for those
values starting to wane. Peterson said it was not clear yet whether the
virtue index would drop to pre-9/11 levels.</TE>
<TE>   The sudden, perhaps transitory, outpouring of benevolence, Peterson
said, is consistent with what happens when people are suddenly forced to
confront a certainty we would sooner forget: We too shall die.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, researchers specializing in "terror management," or
how people handle the fear of death, have done experiments showing that
sudden thoughts of mortality stimulate patriotic impulses, strengthen
support for mainstream values and spur a search for meaning.</TE>
<TE>   "When people are reminded of death, it increases their need to share
in the values of their culture," said psychologist Thomas Pyszczynski,
co-author of a forthcoming book titled "In the Wake of 9/11: The
Psychology of Terror in the 21st Century."</TE>
<TE>   But he doubts that this response will be long-lived.</TE>
<TE>   "My hunch is it's doing those things in the short term," he said. "It
will have that effect until people start forgetting about the attacks and
the threat . . . and go about their daily lives."</TE>
<TE>   The Times poll reinforces his hunch. In November, 13% of respondents
said they were more involved in their community than before the attacks,
but that was down from a post-disaster peak of 20%. The poll's margin of
sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, church attendance has slipped since the weeks immediately
after Sept. 11, when people packed houses of worship and public memorial
services. Religious leaders predicted a great revival, but polls have
found that the proportion of people who say they attend religious
services every week has returned to previous levels, about 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Granovetter, a sociologist at Stanford, said the terrorist
attacks may fail to cause a lasting boost in civic engagement because
there's no issue to rally people.</TE>
<TE>   It's not like feminism or civil rights or the Vietnam War, he said,
adding: "I don't see any social movements arising out of 9/11."</TE>
<TE>Goodwill Often Surges After a Disaster</TE>
<TE>   The experience of people in other countries who live amid violent
conflict may shed some light on what Americans have been going through.</TE>
<TE>   Breznitz, the Israeli psychologist, said feelings of goodwill often
intensify after a disaster, when differences between rich and poor and
black and white are suddenly not important. Research shows that such
feelings are temporary unless violence occurs again, he said. The new
sense of purpose is overwhelmed by "routine and habit, which are very
powerful."</TE>
<TE>   Still, people have been inspired by 9/11 to break out of old habits.
Indeed, implicit in many reflections on the catastrophe is the
realization of shortcomings in American life.</TE>
<TE>   Verna Kay, 54, a retired paralegal in Parkston, S.D., said she started
volunteering at her local Roman Catholic parish after the attacks,
serving meals and washing dishes. She'd always been spiritual, she said,
"but it didn't manifest it in a community way. It was more of a private
thing. But after Sept. 11, I don't think contemplative prayer is enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's kind of reevaluating," she said. "There's always this
constant pressure to focus on work to the detriment of family life . . .
on getting things rather than appreciating that we're living."</TE>
<TE>   Philip Hall, 41, of Denton, Texas, said he now reads to his two
children at night.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to spend a lot of time watching TV and not really
interacting," said the producer of educational videos. "I believe it's
drawn us together. . . . My oldest boy confides in me more often."</TE>
<TE>   Rita Russell, 53, of Cherokee, Okla., said she joined her husband and
three grown children in October for five days of deer hunting. They
stayed in an old camper that her husband bought and fixed up for the
occasion. They talked and talked. They'd never done anything like it.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as the getting together [is concerned], I think we're going to
do more of that," she said. "It makes you realize you better do it today,
because there might not be tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   For decades, ambitious Americans have barely hesitated to put 3,000
miles between themselves and their families, on the assumption that no
place is more than a six-hour flight away. But now some are recalculating
the distance.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate recruiters have noted a rise in the number of top executives
looking to return to their hometowns or searching for jobs requiring less
travel, according to headhunter Jeffrey Clark, a recruiter in the Newport
Beach office of Kenneth Clark International. A number of clients, he
said, "have a newfound sense of wanting to be close to family
structures."</TE>
<TE>   At Brentwood High School in St. Louis, Aisha Hossin, a 17-year-old
senior, had long wanted to study dance at the North Carolina School of
the Arts. But her mother vetoed the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom really wants to keep me in state, and I'm starting to agree."
Now her top college choice is just a two-hour drive from home.</TE>
<TE>   Classmate Julia Schumacher, also 17, is abandoning hope of spending
some of her college years in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "My family, we're big overseas people," she said, recalling her
parents' years as missionaries in Botswana. "But it makes me nervous to
think about what's going on."</TE>
<TE>'This Has Brought Us Together'</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, Adriana DiFranco, 33, and Todd Pfeiffer, 32, were
honeymooning in Arizona. When they returned home to Washington, D.C., it
shook them to see National Guard troops in the streets, police everywhere
and postal workers wearing rubber gloves.</TE>
<TE>   They'd talked before of simplifying their lives, of moving to a
smaller, slower, less expensive place. The attacks, DiFranco said, "put
an exclamation point on that idea."</TE>
<TE>   In late November, they vacated their apartment, stored their
belongings and hit the road in their orange 1974 Volkswagen bus. Now
they're touring the East, visiting friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   "I've taken my family for granted in the past," Pfeiffer said. "This
has brought us together."</TE>
<TE>   She's in marketing, most recently at a dot-com firm, and he's a
business consultant who would rather be a furniture maker. Maybe they'll
settle in North Carolina or Florida, she said.</TE>
<TE>   You could think of them as dropouts, or you could think of them as a
new kind of patriot, goaded by the attacks to live life to the fullest.
Their VW bus, that old anti-establishment symbol, sports a "Powered by
Love" sticker on the rear bumper. In the windshield is an American flag.</TE>
<TE>   "We have it good in this country," Pfeiffer said. "When something like
this happens, it makes you think."</TE>

<HD>Pointing a Finger at Prints</HD>
<DH>Fingerprint matching, the gold standard in courtrooms, is being
called into question. Half the examiners flunk a proficiency test.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Riky Jackson, a prime suspect in the 1997 murder of a friend,
heard that police found bloody fingerprints at the crime scene, he
thought he was off the hook.</LD>
<LD>   "I was innocent," said Jackson, a Philadelphia hairdresser. "There was
no way they could have been mine."</LD>
<LD>   But three prosecution fingerprint experts said they were his, and he
spent 2 1/2 years in prison before authorities acknowledged the error and
set him free.</LD>
<TE>   No one knows how often fingerprint experts send the wrong person to
prison. Ever since fingerprints were first entered as evidence in
American courtrooms nearly a century ago, the methods used for matching
them have been virtually unquestioned. But mounting evidence cited in a
series of legal challenges raises questions about whether the techniques
for matching prints may be flawed.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Jackson's case, several other wrongful accusations based on
fingerprints have been uncovered in the last 25 years. Moreover, nearly
half the examiners who take national certification tests flunk the part
that requires them to correctly match fingerprints. Yet they still can
testify in court.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a federal judge in Philadelphia barred a fingerprint
examiner from testifying that crime scene prints belonged to the
defendants. The judge ruled that fingerprint comparisons are not strictly
scientific, and he limited the expert to identifying matching details.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling bolstered the contention of defense lawyers and others that
examiners do not adhere to a uniform standard when matching fingerprints,
and hence such findings are inherently subjective. Nor has the profession
devised a way for determining how often examiners make mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders in the field counter that their technique meets scientific
muster in several ways, among them: They have been tested in the courts
for decades; their findings in individual cases are subject to peer
review; and fingerprinting is based on scientific research on the origin
of fingerprints during fetal development.</TE>
<TE>   Fingerprint practitioners may err, but properly followed, the methods
for determining whether prints match do not, said Stephen Meagher, an FBI
fingerprint analyst for 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Its error rate is zero," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Challenges to fingerprint evidence are surfacing now because of U.S.
Supreme Court rulings in 1993 and 1999 that set new, more stringent
guidelines for judges in deciding when to let jurors hear experts of
various kinds. The court said in part that judges should decide whether
standard techniques are vulnerable to practitioner error and are applied
in accordance with a uniform objective standard.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of the challenges could have major implications for courts
and police. Fingerprints, along with DNA, are considered the "gold
standard for forensic science," said David Faigman, a Hastings Law School
professor.</TE>
<TE>   If courts routinely question the reliability of fingerprint examiners,
other forensic tools such as fiber comparisons, bite mark analyses and
firearm tests could also lose standing, he said.</TE>
<TE>Fingerprint Evidence Was Challenged</TE>
<TE>   In fingerprinting, the first major challenge under the high court
guidelines surfaced in 1999 in a Philadelphia armored car robbery trial
in which two fingerprint marks found in the vehicle were key evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Epstein, an assistant federal public defender, offered evidence
showing that fingerprint examiners' standards vary from one agency to the
next and that they frequently make mistakes on competency tests. He also
showed how the FBI sent the two crime-scene prints along with his
client's fingerprints to state crime labs across the country and asked
them to determine whether it was his client's prints in the vehicle.
Nearly a quarter couldn't match one crime-scene print to his client, and
almost one-fifth couldn't match the other.</TE>
<TE>   Epstein asked a judge to admit testimony questioning the reliability
of the techniques. The judge refused.</TE>
<TE>   But relying almost entirely on the hearing transcript in Epstein's
case, a judge in another Philadelphia trial ruled that the opinions of
fingerprint experts on whether prints match are not reliable enough to
present to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Louis H. Pollak, former dean of the law schools at
Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, based the ruling in part on the
grounds that there is no means of determining how often practitioners err
when making identifications.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tremendous breakthrough," Epstein said. "It's a fully
reasoned and analyzed opinion."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Patrick Meehan, who is prosecuting the case, has asked
Pollak to reconsider his decision at court hearings this week.</TE>
<TE>   Pollak did concede one point to prosecutors. An individual's
fingerprints are unique and permanent, he wrote in his 49-page opinion,
thus preserving them as a basis for identification.</TE>
<TE>Several Mistakes Are Found</TE>
<TE>   In the last 25 years, several examples have turned up of fingerprint
examiners identifying the wrong person in court.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1977 Minnesota double murder case, defendant Roger Sipe
Caldwell's own fingerprint expert confirmed a prosecution examiner's
finding. The prosecution's expert had matched 11 details in a crime scene
print to Caldwell. A jury, relying on that opinion, convicted Caldwell of
killing an elderly Duluth woman and her nurse. Caldwell was sentenced to
two life terms.</TE>
<TE>   The mistake was uncovered a year later in a co-defendant's trial, when
three other fingerprint examiners called by the defense found that
Caldwell's prints did not match. The co-defendant was acquitted, and
Caldwell's conviction was later reversed on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Riky Jackson, the Philadelphia hairdresser, one of the
experts who erred was a veteran state examiner from Vermont who was
certified by the International Assn. for Identification.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution, relying on him and two local experts, argued that
eight details on the bloody print matched eight details on his print.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's lawyer, Michael J. Malloy of Media, Pa., hired two experts,
one a former FBI fingerprint examiner, who said the comparisons "weren't
even close." The jury chose to believe the prosecution's experts and
found Jackson guilty. He was sentenced to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Malloy and his two experts pushed for reexamination of the prints.
After reviews by the International Assn. for Identification, another
prosecution expert and the FBI showed the matches were wrong, the
district attorney's office acknowledged the mistake and agreed to
Jackson's release in December 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Such cases "clearly show misidentifications happen," Epstein said.
"They are also significant in that you have very experienced examiners
making these identifications."</TE>
<TE>   Epstein said he suspects those cases may be the "tip of the iceberg"
because fingerprint errors show up routinely in various professional
competency tests that examiners have taken over the years.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1995 IAI-approved proficiency test, 22% of the test takers
identified the wrong person one or more times. In addition, 36% could not
identify prints that test givers said they should have been able to
match, which means that a guilty person could have gone free in a real
case.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Smith, chairman of IAI certification, suggests the error rate may
not fairly represent the profession because the test takers were
anonymous and there was no way to determine their credentials.</TE>
<TE>   But fingerprint examiner David Grieve, editor of the Journal of
Forensic Science, said in an article that the test results were alarming
and noted that reaction in the forensic science community "ranged from
shock to disbelief."</TE>
<TE>   "Errors of this magnitude in a discipline singularly admired and
respected for its touted absolute certainty . . . produced chilling and
mind-numbing realities," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>Examiners Have Difficulty Passing Test</TE>
<TE>   Test results in 1997 and 1998 were better.</TE>
<TE>   But people currently working as examiners have difficulty passing a
certification test offered by the International Assn. for Identification.
Close to 50% of the examiners who take it flunk, Smith said. One part
requires examiners to compare crime scene prints with 15 sets of
identified prints.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the part most people fail," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Those examiners can still testify in court. Certification may add
credibility to an examiner's testimony, but it is not a requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Some leaders in the profession say error rates on such tests suggest
more training is needed. But there are no mandatory training standards in
the U.S. Each law enforcement agency establishes its own, resulting in a
hodgepodge of classes, on-the-job training and seminars.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the sheriff's department requires 1 1/2 to two
years of training, according to William Leo, a fingerprint examiner in
the Scientific Services Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department requires its examiners to spend up
to three years lifting prints at crime scenes before they can start
learning how to make fingerprint comparisons, Capt. Paul Enox said. He
said there is no set time for such training. Prospective examiners can
start testifying in court whenever the department's "quality assurance"
program determines they have mastered the techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Los Angeles agency requires IAI certification for its
examiners.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Wertheim, a fingerprint analyst and trainer from Oregon, said the
quality of training varies widely.</TE>
<TE>   "You could have a rural county police department . . . where the
police chief would walk in and pick someone to go to a weeklong school
and say, 'You be our fingerprint person,' " he said. "It is a sad state
of affairs."</TE>
<TE>   Wertheim said training is much more rigorous in some other countries.
New Zealand requires five years of training and passing a comprehensive
competency test. Great Britain also requires five years, and the
Netherlands, three to five years. All three set national training
standards and require police agencies to abide by them, Wertheim said.</TE>
<TE>Training Involves Identifying Patterns</TE>
<TE>   In most training, examiners learn to first study the crime scene
print. The prints usually are fragmentary, blurred, smudged or distorted.
The FBI estimates they are one-fifth the size of the inked print
defendants give at booking.</TE>
<TE>   Examiners try to identify the paths and patterns of a print's ridges,
their ending points, where they fork or intersect with a different ridge
and other details. They try to find the same points on the suspect's
print. Examiners then say the two prints match if the likenesses are
sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   That last step raises the main question: What is sufficient?</TE>
<TE>   Fingerprint examiners in the U.S. don't have any single standard
measure for determining when the likenesses are sufficient. Some
examiners say they find at least eight matching details before
identifying a suspect. Others use 10 to 12. Some other countries require
24 matching details.</TE>
<TE>   That variation is another way the methods fail to meet the Supreme
Court guideline that calls for a uniform standard controlling use of the
techniques of expert witnesses, Pollak said in his opinion.</TE>
<TE>   But defenders of fingerprint comparison techniques point out that
until Pollak, no other judge had rejected their practices. They say their
methods are repeatedly tested in court, where defendants can hire experts
to challenge the prosecution's expert. Moreover, they say their findings
are usually verified by a second examiner.</TE>
<TE>   Epstein counters that verifications of initial results are tainted
because the second examiner knows the prints already have been matched to
the defendant. Second, he said, until the recent challenges, judges had
never been asked to rule on the legitimacy of fingerprinting techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "There had been no adversarial testing [of the technique] in the last
100 years," Epstein said.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Checkpoints Grow Ever Deadlier</HD>
<DH>Mideast: In a 24-hour period, three pregnant women are wounded and
four people are killed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>For Palestinians, Israeli military checkpoints have long been a
hated symbol of occupation, a place where they are humiliated by troops
and sometimes shot. For Israelis, and especially for soldiers and Jewish
settlers, checkpoints are increasingly becoming the new front line in a
17-month-old conflict.</LD>
<LD>   Four people--two Israelis and two Palestinians--were killed Monday at
checkpoints. The wounded included two pregnant women--a Palestinian and
an Israeli--who survived to deliver healthy girls.</LD>
<LD>   The Israelis were Jewish settlers ambushed by Palestinian gunmen as
they sat in their car at a roadblock, awaiting entry into Nokdim, the
West Bank settlement south of Jerusalem where they lived. One of the dead
men in the car was the father of the pregnant Israeli woman.</LD>
<TE>   One of the Palestinians killed was driving his wife, in the throes of
labor, to the hospital in the West Bank city of Nablus. Israeli soldiers
shot and killed the man after he ignored their orders to halt and ran the
roadblock, they said. The wife, who was injured along with her
father-in-law, said they heard no such orders.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time in 24 hours--and at the same military barricade
and under near-identical circumstances--that soldiers shot a pregnant
Palestinian woman en route to the hospital. The woman shot Sunday also
delivered a healthy girl.</TE>
<TE>   The other Palestinian killed Monday was a 15-year-old girl who the
army said charged a roadblock outside the West Bank town of Tulkarm,
brandishing a knife. She refused to stop and was shot; her father later
told reporters in Tulkarm that she left behind a note saying she wanted
to become a "martyr"--to die for the Palestinian cause.</TE>
<TE>   The shootings dramatized what human rights organizations and some
Israeli army officers say is the problematic use of military roadblocks
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The army says checkpoints enhance
security for Israelis. But soldiers have become extremely jittery, and
vulnerable, at checkpoints, after a campaign by Palestinian fighters to
step up their attacks throughout the territories and target troops and
settlers. And the proliferation of checkpoints further punishes,
antagonizes and endangers Palestinian civilians.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate attack Monday, a Palestinian opened fire on Israelis
crowding a bus stop on the northern outskirts of Jerusalem during the
evening rush hour. At least 10 Israelis, including three police officers,
were wounded. The shooter was critically injured, and Israel promised
retaliation after a militia linked to Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction claimed responsibility for this and the
attack on the settlers.</TE>
<TE>   The army launched a review of its use of checkpoints after Palestinian
gunmen last week staged their single deadliest attack on Israeli soldiers
since the latest intifada erupted in September 2000. Six soldiers were
killed at the Ein Arik checkpoint near Ramallah, and the gunmen escaped.
It was a devastating blow to the military.</TE>
<TE>   Army ombudsman Brig. Gen. Uzi Lev-Tzur testified before a
parliamentary committee Monday that troops' complaints about the
conditions at roadblocks had risen significantly and that many soldiers
were "shooting out of fear." An army spokesman denied that soldiers were
trigger-happy and said Israeli forces had a legitimate reason to suspect
vehicles that approached in the middle of the night in hostile areas such
as Nablus.</TE>
<TE>'Surprise' Checkpoints Often Most Dangerous</TE>
<TE>   The two incidents affecting pregnant Palestinians involved a military
position that came into existence only in the middle of last week, when
the army moved its tanks into shooting range of Nablus' Balata refugee
camp, a bastion of Palestinian militancy.</TE>
<TE>   "Surprise," or ad hoc, checkpoints--which the army favors because they
are less of a target--often cause the most trouble and are the most
disruptive to Palestinian traffic.</TE>
<TE>   About 2 a.m. Monday, Mohammed Hayek was driving his wife, Maysoun,
from their village to the Nablus hospital. They approached a checkpoint,
one that they were familiar with, at the village of Hawwara, south of
Nablus. The soldiers there inspected Maysoun's belly, she recalled later,
to make sure she wasn't packing explosives.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers waved them through.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that was the last checkpoint [before Nablus]," Maysoun
said. "It always has been."</TE>
<TE>   Five minutes later, as the car turned onto the main road into Nablus,
she said she suddenly heard shooting. Her husband was hit in the neck and
killed. She crouched on the back floor, and the bullets grazed her
shoulders. Her father-in-law was critically injured before the soldiers
finally held fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I started screaming: 'Baby! Baby!' so the soldiers would understand,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   She lay on a stretcher, cold and bleeding, while the soldiers searched
her and administered first aid. Then they delivered Maysoun, 22, to a
Palestinian ambulance that rushed her to the hospital, where she gave
birth within minutes of her arrival. She named the baby Fida, Arabic for
"sacrifice."</TE>
<TE>   An army spokesman said the soldiers first shouted at the Hayek vehicle
when it approached and then fired in the air. They fired at the car only
after Hayek broke through the roadblock, the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Esam and Shadyah Shehadeh went through a similar experience about 22
hours earlier, clearing one checkpoint only to come under fire at a
second, unexpected barricade. Esam can speak Hebrew and was able to shout
at the soldiers to stop shooting. Shadyah was shot through the chest but
eventually reached the hospital and delivered a girl.</TE>
<TE>   Esam said the soldiers who did the shooting "never said they were
sorry."</TE>
<TE>   B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization that has chronicled
problems at checkpoints, said 11 Palestinians had been killed trying to
cross roadblocks between September 2000 and last week. Four more were
killed in the last seven days. And 25 died when delayed by soldiers as
they tried to reach a hospital or doctor for medical treatment, B'Tselem
said.</TE>
<TE>   B'Tselem director Jessica Montell said that although Israel was
justified in preventing Palestinians from entering Israel, the problem
was that scores of roadblocks dot the West Bank and Gaza and are designed
to impede Palestinian travel within Palestinian territory.</TE>
<TE>   An army officer using the pseudonym "Ilan" told Israeli radio that he
and his men felt like sitting ducks at roadblocks. So one day he
abandoned his position at a barricade just north of Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "We've reached the state where we shoot out of fear," he said. "We use
these bullets as a kind of shield, a wall, because we don't have a wall
or concrete to protect us. . . . In the end, the guys become
trigger-happy and very jumpy."</TE>
<TE>   Ilan was sentenced to 28 days in the brig for desertion.</TE>
<TE>Despite Killings, Settlers Favor Stops</TE>
<TE>   The two settlers killed Monday were among dozens who had been gunned
down on West Bank and Gaza roads. Their car had slowed at the Israeli
checkpoint guarding the entrance to Nokdim when they came under fire, an
army spokeswoman said. The pregnant woman, Tamar Lifschitz, 33, was
rushed to a hospital, where she gave birth by caesarean section while
doctors also treated her gunshot wounds. Her 5-year-old daughter, also in
the car, was not harmed.</TE>
<TE>   Lifschitz's father, Avraham Fish, 60, was killed. The other man killed
was identified by Israeli media as Aharon Gorov, another resident of the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Settler leaders said the army, far from removing checkpoints, should
redouble them and tighten the siege on Palestinian towns.</TE>
<TE>   "This terror attack proves that removing the roadblocks and allowing
the Arabs free movement on the roads endangers lives," Zviki Bar Hai,
head of a settlers governing council in the Hebron region, told Israeli
radio.</TE>
<TE>   Later Monday, the shooting at the bus stop in Neve Yakov, on land that
Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War and later annexed as part of
Jerusalem, sent motorists, pedestrians and waiting passengers fleeing in
panic. The assailant raked the crowd with gunfire until police shot at
him "from every direction" and two passersby jumped him, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Nir Ben-Simhon told Israeli television how he subdued the Palestinian:
"We snatched his gun to kill him, but he was all out of bullets. We
started to beat him up terrible. We had a knife, and we started to stab
him too."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Ben-Simhon grabbed a pair of handcuffs from a wounded police
officer and slapped them on the man.</TE>

<HD>A Night of Firsts for Afghans and Their U.S. Party Guests</HD>
<DH>Asia: Taboos are cast aside at warlord's fete, in a show of thanks
and a plea for more help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>As three Afghan men swung their arms and swayed to music once
banned by the Taliban, wide-eyed Afghans at a religious fete hosted by a
regional warlord watched another landmark event unfold.</LD>
<LD>   Among the 400 U.S. and Canadian guests of Kandahar Gov. Gul Agha
Shirzai, three female American soldiers rose to mimic the dance, their
M-4 rifles bouncing off their swinging hips--this in the conservative
birthplace of the Taliban, where many women have yet to doff their
head-to-toe burkas. In the back of the cavernous tent, 22-year-old Fazal
Amad Karzai broke into a broad grin.</LD>
<LD>   "I have never seen women dance," Karzai, who said he was a cousin of
interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, explained in English. "I want to
make my sister and my daughter to be free. I want to free my women. This
is the happiest day of my life. I am almost crying."</LD>
<TE>   The coed dance marked just one tradition cast aside for Sunday's
event. The party, held in honor of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha,
featured a band brought in from Kabul, the capital, where Taliban
strictures against music were less stringently observed than here. Then
there was the mingled celebration with "unbelievers," reviled as infidels
by fundamentalists, on a Muslim holy day.</TE>
<TE>   The abandonment of taboos amounted to an open show of gratitude by
Shirzai, a shrewd Afghan leader whom some U.S. officials consider a
possible future prime minister. U.S. defense officials say it also
reflects the hope that Americans won't abandon Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things they're very, very concerned about is: Are we going
to stay?" said Ravi Mallikarjunan, an American civilian working in U.S.
military intelligence. "Tonight was a way of showing that they would like
for us very, very much to stay. What you saw is the village elders coming
together to pay their respects."</TE>
<TE>   Like other Afghan leaders, Shirzai has cultivated an alliance with
U.S. military and political officials.</TE>
<TE>   "It's practically unheard of to invite a Christian," Mallikarjunan
said of the Eid celebration. "It's an enormous show of faith and
affection. It transcends normal religious decorum. He is taking an
enormous risk of upsetting his more fundamentalist Islamic folks."</TE>
<TE>   Shirzai's government holds regular meetings with a team of U.S. Army
civil affairs officers at the governor's palace. One of them, Maj.
Michael Blankenship, who shared a warm greeting with Shirzai at the
governor's party, described the U.S. role as one of offering assistance
but not determining outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not here to nation-build," Blankenship said. "We're here to set
the cornerstone for others to build on."</TE>
<TE>   Shirzai has a reputation for wielding power with more discretion than
less subtle Afghan faction leaders, such as the reputedly brutal Northern
Alliance general Abdul Rashid Dostum. At least once, Shirzai is said to
have persuaded U.S. officials to hand over suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban
fighters to his regional army, who reportedly used more aggressive
tactics to wrest intelligence from the detainees within days.</TE>
<TE>   To get to Sunday's party, the American and Canadian soldiers had only
to walk a few hundred yards outside the concertina wire of the U.S.-held
Kandahar airport to the walled compound of Razik Shirzai, the governor's
brother.</TE>
<TE>   Eid celebrants often don new clothes for the occasion. Razik Shirzai
chose the desert camouflage uniform worn by the Americans, adding an
Afghan flag stitched over the left breast pocket, and shiny black U.S.
Special Forces boots that had seen little contact with the inescapable
Kandahar dust. He escorted the base VIPs to a receiving line of southern
Afghan dignitaries.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting to the governor's right were Ahmed Karzai, a local official
and brother of the interim prime minister, and Khalid Pushtoon, a
spokesman for the provincial government. To his left were Shirzai's
security officials, in white navy-style jackets with gold epaulets.
Directly at his side, wearing civilian clothes and a black baseball cap,
was the bearded American colonel in charge of Special Forces troops at
the base; military officials asked that he not be identified by name.</TE>
<TE>   The close relationship between Afghan leaders and U.S. special
operations teams is an open secret, but the details of the cooperation
are closely guarded, at least in part out of the Afghans' concern for the
safety of their benefactors.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the significance of the relationship was clear by the seat of
honor the colonel was given, along with the presence of several
long-haired, unshaven Americans in a mix of civilian and camouflage garb.
U.S. leaders expressed concern for the safety of the colonel after he was
identified in a U.S. news report this week. One Afghan leader complained
that U.S. officials had inappropriately allowed a journalist to attend
the celebration.</TE>
<TE>   For the Afghans inside the brightly colored tent, it was the first
time in years that they had heard a robab, an Afghan stringed instrument.</TE>
<TE>   Waiters passed out trays of pistachios, walnuts, sweet raisins and
almonds to whet the appetites of soldiers accustomed to military rations.
The Afghans waited as hundreds of troops crowded the long table to fill
their plates with chicken kebabs, oranges and soft drinks.</TE>
<TE>   "We call it AFC: Afghan Fried Chicken," quipped Col. Keith Bartsch,
commander of the Air Force's 19th Air Support Operations Squadron.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Gulalai Ali strode onto the dance floor, stripped off his shirt
and demonstrated his bodybuilder physique, smiling as Shirzai and the
crowd applauded. Then, in the wee hours, a U.S. Army officer arrived to
discreetly urge the party-goers to return to the base, past the military
police who sat in heavily armed vehicles cheerfully munching leftover
chicken.</TE>

<HD>Italians Release Details on Suspects</HD>
<DH>Europe: Nine Moroccans are charged in alleged plot to flood the
U.S. Embassy with deadly gas. Police say interrogations have been
fruitless.</DH>

<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>Italian police released information Monday about nine Moroccan
immigrants who were ordered held on charges of subversive association
after a judge agreed that they may have been plotting to send lethal gas
into the U.S. Embassy or to poison its water supply.</LD>
<LD>   But after interrogating the Moroccans for nearly a week, police told
U.S. officials that the suspects had offered nothing to build on evidence
found in one of the men's apartments: a bag containing nearly 9 pounds of
a cyanide compound and a map highlighting water pipes feeding the embassy
complex in central Rome.</LD>
<LD>   Police identified the renter of the suburban apartment as Aziz Jamile,
a 32-year-old pizza chef. He and his four roommates were arrested.
Another key suspect, police said, was Zinedine Tarik, a 37-year-old
manager of a telephone exchange here for immigrants who want to call or
wire money home. Tarik and two others were seized at another apartment.</LD>
<TE>   Jamile and Tarik have Italian work permits, and a third key suspect
has a tourist visa. All but one of the others are illegal immigrants,
police said. The latter group made a living selling cheap consumer goods
in the street. One suspect aspired to a soccer career. Their ages range
from 21 to 44.</TE>
<TE>   Italian officials have not spoken publicly about evidence against the
men, who were rounded up between Feb. 14 and Sunday. But the Italian news
agency ANSA said police had depicted them as foot soldiers who were
preparing the ground for an attack by more sophisticated but still
unidentified terrorists, possibly linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicion about a deadly plot grew Sunday when Italian newspapers
reported the discovery of a hole, big enough for a slender adult to crawl
through, in the concrete wall of a utility tunnel under a street flanking
the embassy. The tunnel was marked on the suspects' map, and Italian
media said the hole appeared only in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Embassy officials, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said
the hole was discovered a day after police raided the Jamile apartment
last week and seized 20 pounds of firecrackers and the bag of potassium
ferrocyanide. The compound can produce a lethal gas when heated.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing Sunday for eight of the men, all denied being terrorists.
Their lawyers said that the suspects did not know anything about the
potassium ferrocyanide and that the firecrackers had been left over from
New Year's Eve festivities.</TE>
<TE>   But Judge Fabrizio Gentili said he was keeping the Moroccans behind
bars because they could not explain the utility map, which shows where
underground pipes enter the embassy complex. The judge said the men might
have been planning to "carry out acts of indiscriminate fanaticism."</TE>
<TE>   "Is that possible?" said a U.S. official who was asked to comment on
the judge's statement. "Yes, absolutely. Do we have any evidence that
would confirm that? No, not yet."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabetta Gentile, a defense lawyer for the Moroccans, said it was
hard to define them as fanatics because, although they are Muslims, "they
are not practicing Muslims. They drink wine and eat pork."</TE>
<TE>   Italian media reports over the weekend spread alarm in the American
diplomatic community. Hundreds of embassy personnel gathered Monday to
hear U.S. Ambassador Mel Sembler appeal for calm and voice "full
confidence in the Italians and our own security people."</TE>
<TE>   Two State Department security experts arrived in Rome to join Italian
police in inspecting the utility tunnel today to assess the threat of an
attack on the mission from there.</TE>
<TE>   The concrete pipe tunnel, under Via Boncompagni, is accessible by
manholes. For safety and security reasons, each end is sealed by a
3-foot-thick concrete wall. Someone had chipped through the top of one of
these walls and left a space about 2 feet high, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But the officials said it was not clear whether the hole was made by
an intruder after the most recent inspection of the tunnel by utility
crews or was left over from previous maintenance work.</TE>
<TE>   Even if terrorists had entered the tunnel, one official said, "it
would have been difficult in the extreme" to cause any harm from there.
The tunnel is a conduit for telephone and electrical wiring, which enters
the embassy compound through smaller branches, each of them too small for
a human to enter.</TE>
<TE>   The official said the tunnel does not contain gas or water lines,
which enter the embassy through nearby trenches.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, potassium ferrocyanide is harmless dissolved in water.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Update on Drug Growers Excuses Some</HD>
<DH>Narcotics: Review cites continued production by three nations but
punishes none.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration Monday criticized the drug-fighting efforts
of Afghanistan, Haiti and Myanmar, yet in effect penalized no country.</LD>
<LD>   The three nations have "failed demonstrably to make substantial
efforts" to fight drug trafficking, the White House said in an annual
report. Twenty other countries with major drug industries, including
Mexico and Colombia, were found to have met the U.S. standard in fighting
drugs in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   By federal law, countries found out of compliance are subject to a
cutoff of U.S. aid.</LD>
<TE>   Afghanistan was given a waiver because of the U.S. interest in
strengthening the new interim government and because the ousted Taliban
government was in power during most of the year. Haiti was let off the
hook on the grounds that halting humanitarian aid to that impoverished
country could touch off a flood of illegal immigration to Florida,
threatening U.S. national security.</TE>
<TE>   As in previous years, Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, was given no
waiver. But that country hasn't received U.S. aid for some time.</TE>
<TE>Annual Procedure Is Always Controversial</TE>
<TE>   The drug "certification" program has been highly controversial,
especially among U.S. allies upset about having their performance
scrutinized annually. In an effort to allay those concerns, the report
this year sought to focus on the poor performers rather than evaluating
each of the 23 countries on the "majors list."</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of presuming everyone is bad and saying then who was good, we
are only making a determination on who was bad, on who didn't do enough,"
said Rand Beers, assistant secretary of State for international narcotics
and law enforcement affairs.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, the Taliban, which came to power in 1996, enforced a
ban on cultivation of the opium poppy in the fall of 2000 that caused
opium production to fall 94% in Afghanistan and nearly 75% worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   But the Taliban did nothing to halt trafficking in the large
stockpiles that remained in the country, and in fact "assumed that the
existences of large stockpiles would continue the cash flow necessary to
keep that government alive," Beers said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, production surged in the parts of the country controlled by
the Northern Alliance, the anti-Taliban opposition that fought with U.S.
forces to oust the regime.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials acknowledged that because of the limited resources of
the fragile new government, the anti-narcotics effort in Afghanistan is
not likely to be highly effective in 2002. Although the government is
committed to fighting the drug trade, "it will [take] several months and
significant assistance from the international community before the
interim authority can take concrete measures to eradicate poppy
production and counter drug trafficking in Afghanistan," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The new poppy crop is due to be harvested at the end of March.
Officials said they might be able to pay some Afghan farmers to plow
their crops under. But "the challenges are enormous," Beers said.</TE>
<TE>Anti-Drug Performance of Haiti Termed 'Weak'</TE>
<TE>   He said Haiti's anti-drug performance was "weak." The government
failed to enact key pieces of legislation and did not increase arrests,
drug seizures or prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, "U.S. vital national interests require that U.S.
assistance to Haiti continues," Beers said.</TE>
<TE>   Myanmar took some measures against drug trafficking, yet "large-scale
poppy cultivation and opium production continue." The country is a huge
producer of methamphetamine; 800 million methamphetamine tablets were
produced there in 2001, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   Myanmar's government also failed to turn over some key trafficking
suspects, including Khun Sa, who is under indictment in the United
States, the report said.</TE>
<TE>Colombia Is Among 20 Nations Certified</TE>
<TE>   Beers said that the efforts of the Colombian police and military have
been "significant" and that their cooperation with U.S. law enforcement
has been "superior." He said the government of Mexico has made
"demonstrable" efforts against drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The 23 countries reviewed were Afghanistan, Myanmar, Haiti, Colombia,
Mexico, Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Dominican Republic, Ecuador,
Guatemala, India, Jamaica, Laos, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay,
Peru, Thailand, Venezuela and Vietnam.</TE>

<HD>Many South Koreans See Skating Loss as Part of U.S. Plot</HD>
<DH>Asia: To angry fans, athlete's disqualification is another
reflection of American arrogance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>Just when you thought the 2002 Winter Olympics were over, the furor
lives on in Seoul.</LD>
<LD>   South Korean fans are still nursing a grudge over their man's loss of
the gold medal last week in the 1,500-meter short-track skating
competition to American Apolo Anton Ohno.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of South Koreans are participating in an online fund-raising
campaign to buy a $1,350 replica of the gold medal, which they hope to
present Wednesday to skater Kim Dong Sung on his return from Salt Lake
City. They have launched angry e-mail campaigns against the U.S. Olympic
Committee; against NBC, which televised the Olympics; and against
comedian Jay Leno, who rubbed salt in the wound with a biting joke about
Korean anger.</LD>
<TE>   It is not simply a question of sports. The loss of the gold medal is
widely perceived here as part of a larger conspiracy by the United States
to override South Korea's interests in favor of its own agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of American arrogance, which disregards international
justice and the pureness of sports, reflects U.S. President George W.
Bush's unilateral diplomatic policies," said ruling party legislator Kim
Seong Ho in a statement Monday to the National Assembly. Bush's visit to
Seoul last week drew many protests from South Koreans who, despite
Washington's declarations to the contrary, fear that the United States
will invade the North.</TE>
<TE>   Kim also echoed the complaints of many South Koreans that the United
States improperly politicized the Olympics to drum up support for its
campaign against terrorism and turned the Games into "a private memorial
service for the victims of the New York terrorist attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Jang Yung Je, a manager at Haansoft Computers and one of the
organizers of the fund-raising campaign to replicate the gold medal for
skater Kim, said she believes that the Olympic judges wanted to give the
United States more than its rightful share of gold to salve the wounds of
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "The most commonly heard theory is that America wanted to regain its
pride that was torn by the terrorist attacks and that they expected to be
compensated by the judges," Jang said. "I believe that too."</TE>
<TE>   In an editorial published Monday, the English-language Korea Herald
declared that "a new Cold War has started" over the "scandalous
proceedings in Salt Lake City."</TE>
<TE>   The skating ruling, widely criticized even outside South Korea, was
made by an Australian referee during the Wednesday night race. Three days
of appeals, first to the International Skating Union and then to the
Court of Arbitration for Sport, failed to advance the South Korean
delegation's complaints.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian, Japanese, Canadian, Chinese and Ukrainian delegations
also have complained about the Games--the Russians the loudest. But South
Koreans turned to the weapon they best deploy: the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of the race, the U.S. Olympic Committee Internet server
crashed under the weight of 16,000 e-mails, most of them from South
Korea, one of the most wired countries in the world. Some of the e-mails
were so threatening, especially toward skater Ohno, who is Japanese
American, that the FBI opened an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   About 48,000 South Korean fans staged a cyber-attack on NBC. Leno has
been a particular target of their wrath after cracking a joke about the
skater kicking and eating his dog. South Koreans are particularly
sensitive to foreign criticism of their penchant for dog meat.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 South Korean Internet sites have launched Olympic
protests since the controversial race. Angry sports fans have also
deluged South Korean government sites with demands for a nationwide
boycott of American products.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. is the axis of evil in sports," read one typical entry last
weekend on an Internet site.</TE>
<TE>   "Let the world see united Koreans. . . . Let us not repeat our history
in which we never took revenge!" proclaimed another.</TE>
<TE>   One sociologist here suggested that the dramatic reaction to the
Olympics reflects a long-standing Korean complex about being the
underdog.</TE>
<TE>   "Korea has been surrounded and dominated by bigger countries
throughout its history--by China, by Japan, these days by America. We are
defensive because of that," said Lew Suk Choon of Yonsei University. "One
gold medal might not mean very much to a big country like the United
States, but to us it means international recognition."</TE>
<TE>   "We are a small country. This is the only way we can fight back,"
agreed Min Lee, a 33-year-old worker for a security company who has been
participating in the cyber-war.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, a South Korean boxer staged a
memorable sit-in, refusing to leave the ring for 67 minutes to protest a
referee's ruling against him. During the same match, coaches and fans
threw chairs at the referee.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Breen, author of "The Koreans," said Koreans tend to "project
insecure nationalism onto their athletes because historically they felt
the world was against them."</TE>
<TE>   Breen also chalked up the intense reaction to the Olympics this year
to the emotional character of the South Korean people. He recalled that
many times during important soccer games, he has read newspaper reports
of fans dying of heart attacks from cheering too much.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a country filled with passion and emotion," Breen said. "They
lose rationality. But then again, don't all fans?"</TE>

<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>The nation's main opposition leader was charged Monday with treason
for allegedly plotting to assassinate President Robert Mugabe, but he
denied the allegations and said he would continue campaigning for
elections less than two weeks away.</LD>
<LD>   "This whole thing is contrived to damage me politically," candidate
Morgan Tsvangirai said. "The timing is obvious. This was all along [the
ruling party] strategy to eliminate me from the race."</LD>
<LD>   The election is scheduled for March 9 and 10. Mugabe, the southern
African nation's only leader since it won independence from Britain in
1980, is fighting for his political life as Zimbabwe's economy collapses
and political violence rages.</LD>
<TE>   Police questioned Tsvangirai, president of the Movement for Democratic
Change, Zimbabwe's main opposition party, for two hours Monday. He was
charged with treason, released and told he would be summoned later, he
said. Treason convictions carry the death penalty in Zimbabwe.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the
charge "falls against a backdrop of a very well-documented campaign of
violence and intimidation against the opposition."</TE>
<TE>   "We're aware of no convincing evidence that there's any basis for
these allegations," Boucher said.</TE>

<LD>Serbian forces burned a paralyzed ethnic Albanian woman alive in
her home, killed a toddler and blew up a mosque during their 1999
crackdown in Kosovo, a witness said Monday at the war crimes trial of
former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.</LD>
<LD>   Halil Morina, a retired ethnic Albanian farmer in Kosovo, said
three-quarters of his village, Landovica, was torched in March 1999, when
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization began bombing Yugoslavia in
response to the crackdown in Kosovo.</LD>
<LD>   "While they were burning the village they killed a gypsy . . . and a
paralyzed woman. They set fire to her in her own house," Morina told the
Hague court.</LD>
<TE>   Milosevic faces 66 counts of war crimes related to conflicts in
Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, a province of Serbia,
Yugoslavia's dominant republic. He could be sentenced to life in prison
if convicted of any charge.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic spent about an hour cross-examining Morina, asking him if he
had seen ethnic Albanian rebels or if villagers had suffered during NATO
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Morina told Milosevic he was "just a farmer" and couldn't tell him
about the Kosovo Liberation Army. He said he hadn't seen NATO bombers on
their raids or the damage they inflicted.</TE>

<LD>Two contenders to lead Mexico's biggest political party back to the
presidency appeared nearly tied in an election to pick a new chief.</LD>
<LD>   Figures released Monday afternoon by the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, showed Beatriz Paredes, leader of the lower house of
Congress, ahead of former Tabasco state Gov. Roberto Madrazo by barely
2,600 votes, with 75.7% of ballots counted. Madrazo declared earlier that
he had won.</LD>
<LD>   The winner of Sunday's vote is expected to help bring the PRI back
from its defeat in the 2000 elections, when its candidate lost the
presidency for the first time in 71 years. A final tally is expected by

<HD>Ruin Marks Blood, Honor in Kosovo</HD>
<DH>Yugoslavia: The tale of a massacre at the home of a guerrilla
leader may unwittingly support the core of Slobodan Milosevic's defense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PREKAZ, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>A memorial is being constructed here to honor the memory of Adem
Jashari and his family, who ignited all-out war for Kosovo's independence
by sacrificing their lives four years ago.</LD>
<LD>   From the perspective of ethnic Albanians who backed the armed struggle
against Serbian rule, the ruined home where 20 Jasharis--including women
and children--died is drenched not only in blood but also in honor.
Glossy brochures for visitors tell the story of events here in that
spirit.</LD>
<LD>   Just what happened in March 1998 has assumed renewed importance
because the first prosecution witness at the war crimes trial of former
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic cited the Jasharis' massacre as a
key point of his testimony. Mahmut Bakali, an ethnic Albanian politician,
told the court Feb. 18 that Milosevic had defended the killings to him as
a justified police action against terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   A pamphlet available here at the memorial site, though written to
glorify Adem Jashari, can be seen as unwittingly supporting an argument
central to Milosevic's defense: that the war in Kosovo originated
primarily as a fight between armed secessionists and government forces.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors will be trying to prove that Milosevic bore responsibility
for the actions of his forces in Kosovo three years ago. The 1998
killings in Prekaz are not listed in the indictment. But whether these
deaths, which ushered in a wider war between ethnic Albanians and
Milosevic's forces, are interpreted as a coldblooded massacre or as the
result of a justifiable police action could help set the tone for the
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic is accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, in part
for the actions of Yugoslav soldiers, Serbian police and paramilitary
forces. Thousands of ethnic Albanians were slain and hundreds of
thousands driven from their homes before North Atlantic Treaty
Organization airstrikes forced Milosevic to withdraw his forces from
Kosovo in 1999 and accept a U.N. administration that continues today.</TE>
<TE>   Most ethnic Albanians see the current situation as virtually ensuring
eventual independence for Kosovo, which technically remains part of
Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   Acting as his own lawyer, Milosevic cross-examined Bakali last Tuesday
about the Jasharis' deaths. In a question apparently meant to suggest
that the family forced the hand of police, he asked: "Did you know that
they did not want to surrender and they shot at policemen?"</TE>
<TE>   The pamphlet distributed at the battle site focuses on Adem Jashari--a
founder of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army--and the 19 members of
his family who died with him. It does little more than mention the 36
distant relatives and neighbors also killed in the three-day siege. But
the brochure presents a picture of a family fiercely devoted to the fight
for independence and ready to give their lives for that cause.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "The Jasharis, the Story of a Resistance," the pamphlet traces
Adem Jashari's eight-year armed struggle and declares that family members
were "loyal co-fighters" who were "ready for sublime sacrifice."</TE>
<TE>   Jashari's wife, Adile, was the first person killed in the 1998 siege,
"while taking ammunition to Adem," the brochure says. The last to die was
their son Kushtrim, 13, who fell "holding the automatic gun in his
hands," it says. Most of the family members--including Jashari's mother,
a 7-year-old niece and 11 others--were killed when a Serbian mortar shell
hit the house, while Jashari's niece Besarta survived the siege "to tell
about the . . . hell," it says.</TE>
<TE>   According to reports at the time by foreign journalists quoting
survivors of the battle, some of the distant Jashari relatives who lived
nearby were executed after being captured or killed while trying to flee.
The pamphlet does not address how the others died, but it stresses that
none of the 20 people killed in Adem Jashari's immediate family had tried
to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Jashari and his family knew the previous night that Serbian forces
were assembling for an assault, the pamphlet says.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up on stories of "century-old battles for liberation" waged by
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, Jashari came to "adore heroes" and "never
parted from his gun," the pamphlet says.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1991, Adem and his friends went to Albania to get prepared for the
battles to come," it says. ". . . During 1991 they frequently crossed the
Kosovo-Albanian border, beginning armed actions against the Serbian
police. Numerous actions were successfully undertaken. . . . The Serb
state was being hit in its most sensitive part: in its repressive
apparatus."</TE>
<TE>   Serbian police and military first "laid siege" to the Jashari family
compound Dec. 30, 1991, the pamphlet says.</TE>
<TE>   Large numbers of armed and unarmed people rushed to Prekaz in support
of the Jasharis, and "this was the last time that the police [went] into
Prekaz in seven years," it says.</TE>
<TE>   Serbian forces returned to assault the Jashari compound on Jan. 22,
1998, using "mortars, guns and automatic weapons," the pamphlet says.
Jashari was not home, but the men who were there drove away the
attackers. The next day, once again, thousands of supporters descended on
the village from the surrounding Drenica region, it says.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge was too open, and the disgrace of the Serbs was too
much to swallow," the pamphlet continues. "Therefore, they were preparing
themselves for the final, fatal and antihuman blow that was to follow."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the guerrillas kept up the pressure. On Feb. 28, 1998, a small
KLA unit was ambushed by a Serbian police patrol near Likosane, but only
one fighter was wounded while six police were killed, the pamphlet says.</TE>
<TE>   "A typical Serb revenge was organized," with police forces using tanks
and helicopters to lay siege to the villages of Likosane and Cirez,
killing 24 people, "among whom only four resisted with arms," it says.</TE>
<TE>   That night, Jashari helped evacuate the wounded, the pamphlet says.
Then he went home and warned his family members that they might be next.
Friends and well-wishers urged them to flee, it says, but "they had
decided not to leave their home and land."</TE>
<TE>   Days later, the family's last stand began, and Kosovo erupted in war.</TE>

<HD>Emptied Camps Show Rebels Prepped for War</HD>
<DH>Colombia: Outposts indicate the FARC used the peace zone for combat
training and to nurse U.S. hostility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOS POZOS, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>Just beyond the fronded huts where negotiators used to talk peace,
leftist rebels had a camp ready for war.</LD>
<LD>   There were wooden bunks for troops scattered among the trees and a
classroom where rebel instructors gave lessons on radio communications.
There was even a makeshift Jiffy Lube, a wooden rack designed to raise
the rebels' many stolen four-wheel-drives for oil changes.</LD>
<LD>   The camp was abandoned about a week ago, when President Andres
Pastrana abruptly ordered the military to retake a former demilitarized
zone ceded for negotiations to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, known as the FARC.</LD>
<TE>   The rebels apparently were able to carry off most of what they had in
the camp, located just behind the site of the fruitless negotiations.
They left behind only scraps of paper, a bit of food and a chilling
message, scrawled across a blackboard:</TE>
<TE>   "The people ask, 'How are we going to take out the gringos if they get
involved?' The FARC answers them: 'With a war that is a guerrilla war and
an organized people.' "</TE>
<TE>   Plastered on the blackboard was a newspaper article from August, only
six weeks before a "breakthrough" in the process.</TE>
<TE>   A daylong tour of the increasingly unstable former peace zone revealed
the extent to which the FARC pays attention to the United States, both as
a supporter of the Colombian military and as a direct enemy.</TE>
<TE>   It also showed that while the Colombian military and police brought
plastic flags, a marching band and a burst of macho adrenaline when they
reentered the zone last week, they did not bring its inhabitants more
security, or peace.</TE>
<TE>   The military and police have at best tenuous control of the former
peace zone's five towns, which remain filled with rebel infiltrators. But
they seemed to have almost no hold on the more than 260 villages that
make up the mostly rural former zone, which is about twice the size of
New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here and we will be here waiting for the army," said
Comandante Pija, a rebel commander manning a roadblock about 19 miles
west of this tiny town, once the headquarters for the peace talks. As he
and his men stopped vehicles and inspected cargo, he said he had seen no
troops nor experienced combat.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not hidden," he said with a laugh, when asked whether the FARC
had fled into the jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia's nearly 40-year-old internal conflict is complicated, a
multilateral battle among the government, right-wing paramilitary groups,
the FARC and a smaller rebel army.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has become increasingly involved as it seeks to cut down
Colombia's drug industry, which helps finance both guerrilla groups as
well as the paramilitary groups that commit most of the massacres in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   That involvement grew even deeper last week, as Washington decided to
begin sharing military intelligence with the Colombians to fight
guerrillas and speed up delivery of spare parts for U.S. equipment used
by Colombian forces. The highest U.S. military official in the country
accompanied a Colombian government delegation on a visit to the zone last
week.</TE>
<TE>Printout of a U.S. Report on Terrorism</TE>
<TE>   In one camp belonging to a guerrilla leader was a printout of a recent
U.S. Embassy report on terrorism. The FARC has been included on the State
Department's list of terrorist groups; that page was missing from the
lengthy document.</TE>
<TE>   In several camps were press summaries, some written in hand, others
downloaded from the Internet, that included articles from U.S. news
agencies and a U.S. newspaper about various developments in the peace
process.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas at the roadblock made it clear that they consider
themselves at war with the U.S. They blamed U.S. support for the first
government attack against the guerrillas 38 years ago and said that Plan
Colombia, the U.S.-backed program to halve the country's drug production,
was only the latest reincarnation of that aggression.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. aid to Colombia in the form of helicopters and troop training is
supposed to be limited to counternarcotics efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "It was directed at us. Plan Colombia was an excuse. All the
helicopters were used to fight against the guerrillas," Pija said. "They
want to exploit Colombia and its riches--our oil, our minerals, our
coal."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides continued to fight during the negotiations, which never
produced a cease-fire or much else.</TE>
<TE>   One of the primary reasons behind mounting frustration with the talks
was accusations that the guerrillas used the peace zone to prepare for
war. That seemed obvious from the clues that remained in the camps.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the camps were in dense jungle, with huts, kitchens, classrooms
and supply depots squeezed among towering trees that provide thick cover.
All the camps seemed to have electricity. Some had gas stations.</TE>
<TE>   In a camp belonging to Joaquin Gomez, head of the local FARC command
bloc, was a wooden gun carved to resemble an automatic rifle. A handful
of bullets lay scattered on the ground. There was also what appeared to
be an extensive system of trenches, 5 feet deep and curving through dense
jungle.</TE>
<TE>   There was an intricate obstacle course on about an acre of land that
included barbells, parallel bars, even a wooden structure built like the
facade of a home, good for practicing storming.</TE>
<TE>Alarming News in Training Notes</TE>
<TE>   One notebook lying in the camp had a chart with carefully scrawled
figures: "Table on how to shoot down planes and helicopters," read the
title. The table contained data on how fast helicopters, bombers and
fighters move and how to best aim to shoot them down.</TE>
<TE>   The last seems especially bad news for U.S. pilots at work in
Colombia. The State Department hired a private U.S. company,
Virginia-based DynCorp, to fumigate Colombia's coca crops, sending in
spray planes low over fields in rebel areas.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels also seemed obsessed with the media. There were several
abandoned notebooks containing grammatically atrocious radio news show
transcripts. Copies of recent Colombian newsmagazines and newspapers
could be found in the open-air beds in the camps.</TE>
<TE>   Rebels at the roadblock said three years of peace talks had given them
ample time to prepare to defend the zone in future battles. They
confirmed that guerrillas within Colombia's major cities had plans for
attack, and threatened further violence against U.S. contractors.</TE>
<TE>   They also implied that they had used the zone to train commanders and
to expand their presence throughout the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "The demilitarized zone was useful for us. We prepared ourselves
politically and militarily," Pija said. "Before, we weren't familiar with
some parts of the country. Now we're sending troops there.</TE>
<TE>   "We benefited a lot," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The camps and interviews also revealed much about the guerrillas'
daily life and gave a hint of the grim and conflicted future facing the
estimated 100,000 people living in the former peace zone.</TE>
<TE>   The largest city in the region, San Vicente del Caguan, is now without
power, running water or phone service, the victim of rebel attacks.
Televisions do not work because rebels have blown up transmission towers.</TE>
<TE>   The 70-mile stretch between San Vicente and Florencia--both cities
equipped with large military brigades--remains a hazardous no man's land
with rebel roadblocks and booby traps. A minor presidential candidate was
kidnapped over the weekend, and some taxicab drivers refuse to make the
passage.</TE>
<TE>   The government said last week that it wants to reestablish a presence
in the zone to show residents that they are no longer in the hands of the
domineering and capricious FARC.</TE>
<TE>   But it said it would proceed slowly through a region that has been
under control of the rebels for 38 years and that has lacked any military
presence for the last three.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be careful about this," one military source said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, instead of a demonstration of state power, the opposite
has occurred. "The guerrillas say to us: If the army is here to guarantee
your safety, where are they?" said one taxicab driver who refused to
drive to Florencia on Monday.</TE>
<TE>Personal Side of Rebel Life</TE>
<TE>   What the guerrillas left behind was not all about war, of course.
There were also clues to the rebels' quotidian, if strange, existence in
the jungle, the daily bread and butter of life in the middle of an
irregular war.</TE>
<TE>   Artists and intellectuals had sent copies of their work to the
guerrillas, signed with enthusiastic notes. One rebel had pasted bra ads
from a local magazine all across his wooden bunk.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was this notebook, found on the ground. Toward the end was
a series of mash notes, apparently scrawled back and forth between two
rebels. An estimated third of the FARC's force are women.</TE>
<TE>   "I love you," read the first set of handwriting. "I like you," read
the second. Then, the final note: "Hay lovio."</TE>
<TE>   Pronounced phonetically in Spanish, the phrase approximates the sound
of the English "I love you."</TE>

<HD>Suspects in Pearl Case to Stay in Jail</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: Judge gives prosecutors more time to compile evidence
against militants accused in the killing of U.S. reporter.</DH>

<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>A Pakistani judge gave prosecutors two more weeks Monday to build
their case against three Islamic militants accused in the kidnapping and
slaying of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.</LD>
<LD>   The judge in this southern city ordered chief suspect Ahmad Omar Saeed
Sheikh and two alleged accomplices to remain jailed until their next
court hearing.</LD>
<LD>   In the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, the U.S. ambassador said she
would meet with President Pervez Musharraf on Wednesday to discuss
Saeed's possible extradition to the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Sheikh and his co-defendants--Sheikh Adil, a constable with the police
department's special branch, and Salman Saquib--were brought to a special
anti-terrorism court in two armored personnel carriers, their faces
covered by white hoods. Dozens of police patrolled the corridors and
grounds of the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside, the suspects were taken to a closed hearing in the
judge's chamber. A preliminary indictment had been expected Monday, but
the judge postponed it.</TE>
<TE>   Khawaja Naveed, the lawyer for Adil and Saquib--Sheikh is not being
represented by an attorney--said all three complained to the judge that
they had been pressured into signing confessions.</TE>
<TE>   "The honorable court has directed the police not to use coercive
measures and not to [pressure] the suspects," Naveed told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh refused to make a confessional statement at the hearing,
raising questions about a confession police said he made shortly after
his arrest in which he claimed to be the ringleader in the abduction.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl disappeared Jan. 23 in Karachi while working on a story about
Islamic radicals in Pakistan. A videotape showing his slaying surfaced
last week.</TE>

<HD>Warrant Issued for Russian Arms Broker Tied to Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH>Probe: Belgian officials hope to find and arrest man accused of
supplying weapons to terrorists.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Belgian authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Victor Bout,
a Russian arms trafficker suspected of helping Al Qaeda terrorists and
supplying weapons to violent uprisings across Africa.</LD>
<LD>   The filing of a warrant on suspicion of money laundering represents
the first formal move by any government against Bout, whose elusiveness
while allegedly transporting weapons to Africa and Afghanistan has
frustrated diplomats and law enforcement officials for more than a
decade.</LD>
<LD>   The action may set off diplomatic wrangling as the Belgians try to
locate Bout and apprehend him. It came after years of international
pressure that failed to stop him from doing business. Since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, allegations that Bout aided Al Qaeda and Taliban
militants have heightened scrutiny of his activities and lent urgency to
the efforts to dismantle his far-flung network of cargo planes and
pilots.</LD>
<TE>   A Belgian prosecutor issued the warrant against Bout last week, the
climax of a four-year probe into his alleged funneling of millions of
dollars from arms-trafficking profits in Africa and Asia into Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   "If he can be brought to Belgium, everything will be done to bring him
to justice," a Belgian official said.</TE>
<TE>   Belgian officials were uncertain Monday where to find Bout and whether
they could win his extradition. One official said authorities suspect
that Bout is in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Bout, who owns an apartment in a five-story building in Moscow, is
believed by American officials to have been in Russia as recently as last
week.</TE>
<TE>   The Belgian official said U.S. pressure may be needed to persuade the
Russian government to extradite Bout, who has been known to use five
Russian passports as he hopscotches around the world. Bout has been
traced to Russia and the United Arab Emirates since last spring despite a
U.N. travel ban imposed on him. He has owned residences in the Emirates,
on the Belgian coast and in several places in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "If we want the Russians to move in that regard, then I think we will
need some pressure from Washington," the Belgian official said.</TE>
<TE>   American officials appear willing to provide "reasonable assistance,"
said a source familiar with U.S. interest in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials were not available late Monday to comment on the
Belgian arrest warrant. But media reports that Bout might be in Russia
prompted the country's Interior Ministry last week to look into whether
he was there and whether he could be extradited. Belgian officials said
they were concerned that the Russians might not be willing to "give up
one of their nationals."</TE>
<TE>   Andrei Polyakov, a spokesman for the Russian Interior Ministry, said
last week that the department was trying "to find out who Victor Bout is,
whether he committed any crimes and where he can be found. This
information is being thoroughly examined and checked now."</TE>
<TE>   Tatyana Matyunina, of the prosecutor general's office, said her bureau
needed information from the Interior Ministry before deciding whether
Bout could be extradited.</TE>
<TE>   Repeated calls to the Moscow apartment owned by Bout went unanswered.
Near the apartment's massive metal door, a neighbor deflected questions
about Bout and threatened to call the police.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not home!" the neighbor said.</TE>
<TE>   The Belgians have referred the warrant against Bout to Interpol, the
global law enforcement agency, which has been conducting its own probe of
Bout's activities for two years.</TE>
<TE>   "This man has escaped justice wherever he has been," said Harjit
Sandhu, an Indian government police official who worked for Interpol and
has investigated Bout's activities for the United Nations. "His tentacles
are spread everywhere, and the U.S. role of global policeman here is
essential."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. national security and diplomatic officials have pressed European,
African and Persian Gulf nations in recent years to move against Bout.</TE>
<TE>   A former U.S. official involved in efforts to halt his arms shipments
said the Belgian warrant was "an extremely encouraging development." Lee
S. Wolosky, formerly a National Security Council aide who directed the
Office of Transnational Threats, said that "the Russians should execute
the warrant, and I am confident the Bush administration will urge them to
do so."</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks after Sept. 11, the U.S. effort against Bout appeared to
make strides after a close associate of his approached authorities and
offered details about the Russian's work on behalf of Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Since late September, U.S. authorities have interviewed the informant,
a Kenyan diamond mine owner and intimate of African dictators, in Belgium
and Washington. The informant, Sanjivan Ruprah, told a Belgian
arms-trafficking expert that he had knowledge of plane-leasing
arrangements between Bout's organization and Al Qaeda operatives.</TE>
<TE>   Ruprah was arrested in early February by Belgian police and charged
with money laundering and conspiracy after a separate investigation that
grew out of the larger Bout probe, Belgian prosecutor Dirk Merckx
confirmed recently. Ruprah is being held in a Brussels jail, charged with
money laundering, conspiracy and possession of false documents.</TE>
<TE>   Ruprah's willingness to cooperate with U.S. and Belgian investigators
seemed less certain last week after his lawyer denounced authorities,
saying they manipulated world opinion in the case.</TE>
<TE>   But other evidence has surfaced that bolsters the Kenyan's references
to Bout's leasing arrangements with Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Sandhu said Monday that U.N. investigators had obtained a document
indicating that Bout leased planes to Ariana Airlines, the national
carrier of Afghanistan. The Times reported last month that Taliban
officials had hired Air Cess, one of Bout's Emirates-based air cargo
firms, to work with Ariana to funnel arms and military supplies to
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The document, obtained during the U.N.'s investigation of arms
shipments to West Africa, "shows that Bout was definitely working with
the Taliban," Sandhu said. The evidence detailed how Bout "leased planes
to Ariana for transshipment of cargo."</TE>
<TE>   Sandhu is an expert on money laundering who investigated Bout's
activities as part of a panel researching massive arms shipments into the
West African country of Liberia. The document did not overtly describe
arms shipments, Sandhu said, but the phrase "scientific equipment" was
often used on Bout's contracts to refer to clandestine shipments of
weapons and military gear.</TE>
<TE>   The Belgian money-laundering investigation of Bout tracked movement
over the last four years of "millions in Belgian francs" from the African
arms trade, Sandhu said.</TE>

<HD>Used by Taliban and Bombed by U.S., a Village Aches</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: A clan that briefly sheltered a fleeing regime
official mourns 12 relatives lost in an airstrike and four others who
were taken away.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ZANI KHEL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>In this tiny Afghan hamlet that fewer than 100 people call home,
the Muslim holy days of Eid al-Adha, usually the most joyous of family
celebrations, have been filled with grief.</LD>
<LD>   The families of Sarajiddin and of Haji Ajab Gul are mourning the loss
of 12 civilian relatives in an American bombing raid last fall and the
detention by coalition forces of four family members at the end of
January.</LD>
<LD>   No reason has been given for the detentions, nor do the families know
where their relatives are being held.</LD>
<TE>   "Look at these children. It is Eid and they have no father," said
Sadem, a cousin who lived in one of the compounds that was bombed and
whose brother was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed to the crowd of children gathered around him.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell the Americans to release their father. His daughters, his sons,
they are so sad. He has done no sin. We have no idea why they took him,"
Sadem said.</TE>
<TE>   The story of Zani Khel mirrors those of other villages across
Afghanistan's southern tier, where bombing was heavy and detentions
frequent as coalition forces, led by Americans, prosecuted their war
against the Al Qaeda terrorist network. In such places, civilians have
been especially vulnerable because supporters of the deposed Taliban
regime and Al Qaeda are often mixed with the local population.</TE>
<TE>   The families in Zani Khel live about half an hour's drive from the
city of Khowst. Until Sept. 11, the area was home to a number of Arabs
believed to be members of Al Qaeda; many then fled to Pakistan. It is a
region where most people were pro-Taliban until the Islamic government
fell, largely because they found it easier to work with the Taliban than
against it.</TE>
<TE>   The families of Zani Khel apparently agreed to shelter fleeing Taliban
members, making the village a target for American bombers. The subsequent
arrest of four people is harder to understand, because the commandos who
came to these poor homes offered no information, and questions put by the
family to Americans at a nearby air base have gone unanswered.</TE>
<TE>   "My father is an uneducated man, he cannot read or write, he didn't
have any job with the Taliban, he was not a mullah, we don't belong to Al
Qaeda. Please tell the Americans to let him come home," said Taj Maluk,
30, the eldest son of Sarajiddin, one of the people arrested.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military officials will not comment on whether they have detained
specific individuals, and there is not even a way for family members to
find out where their relatives are being held or to check on their
conditions, a spokesman for the Pentagon's Central Command said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not familiar with any avenue for that sort of contact," said Navy
Cmdr. Dan Keesee.</TE>
<TE>   Some details about the families could raise questions in the minds of
U.S. investigators, and the Americans may have intelligence about
individuals' activities that was unknown to family members.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he was upset with the Americans for the detention of his
father, Sakhi Gul, another of Sarajiddin's sons, told a reporter, "I want
the Americans to stay in Afghanistan to bring peace."</TE>
<TE>   But others in the family compound shouted at him: "How can you say
that? They killed your family. They killed your mother. They arrested
your father. You should speak the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Sur Gul, a local commander in Khowst who oversees the security of the
city and works closely with U.S. soldiers in the area, was circumspect
about the recent arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "If the people belonged to the Taliban, the Americans didn't make a
mistake to arrest them," he said. "But I don't have any information that
the Americans had intelligence about them."</TE>
<TE>   The village's problems started Nov. 16, the first day of the Muslim
holy month of Ramadan, a period of intense prayer and fasting. That
evening, the Taliban leader for the southern provinces, Jalaluddin
Haqqani, who local villagers say was heavily supportive of Al Qaeda,
arrived at the home of Sarajiddin.</TE>
<TE>   Haqqani remains a near legendary figure in this area, known for having
successfully led moujahedeen forces against the Soviets and eventually
driving them out of Khowst.</TE>
<TE>   The 55-year-old Sarajiddin ran a small guest house next to his home,
and Haqqani asked if he could stay there four or five hours. Kabul, the
capital, had fallen to Northern Alliance troops, and the Taliban
leadership and Al Qaeda members were on the run, rarely staying anywhere
for long.</TE>
<TE>   "My father said, 'No, please don't stay here,' " said Maluk. But the
ethnic Pushtun tradition of hospitality is strong, and Haqqani had
arrived with soldiers, so in the end Sarajiddin did not refuse him. Just
as Haqqani was about to leave, the bombs hit. Four explosions rocked
Sarajiddin's home, the guest house and an adjacent house where relatives
lived.</TE>
<TE>   In an instant, blankets went up in flames, carpets caught fire,
children screamed.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't see anything. It was chaos. All I could hear were the
voices of women and children crying. Then the roof collapsed," said Sakhi
Gul, Sarajiddin's 17-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, Sarajiddin's wife, Fatima, was dead, along with one
of his sisters-in-law, a daughter-in-law and six girls and three
boys--all under age 12.</TE>
<TE>   Also killed were eight or 10 of Haqqani's bodyguards, but the leader,
though injured, escaped with his remaining guards, according to
Sarajiddin's relatives. The family buried their dead in a small graveyard
just beyond their house and pleaded with the family of Bacha Khan, which
controls the immediate area, to help them rebuild their home.</TE>
<TE>   Bacha Khan, who at the time called himself governor of the province as
well as of two adjacent provinces, brought Sarajiddin about $500 to help
with the reconstruction and said the Americans understood they had made a
terrible mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the family members were putting their lives back together,
tragedy struck again.</TE>
<TE>   At 3 a.m. on Jan. 20, they woke to the sound of helicopters landing in
the desert scrub surrounding their house. Heavily armed commandos stormed
through the mud-walled compound's steel gates, bursting the locks with
explosives. They rushed into the family's rooms. They grabbed the men,
restraining young and old with plastic cuffs. It is unclear whether the
commandos were Americans or British. Villagers described them only as
English-speaking.</TE>
<TE>   The raid lasted two hours. Then Sarajiddin, his brother, one of his
sons and the brother of Sadem, were pushed into the waiting helicopters,
Maluk said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of those arrested, Sarajiddin's son and Sadem's brother, had both
just returned from Saudi Arabia for Ramadan. Saudi Arabia is one of the
places that have fed activists into Al Qaeda; however, it is also a
place, like Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, where southern Afghans
routinely go to work so they can send money home. Indeed, it is rare to
find a family in this region that does not have a relative in Saudi
Arabia or Dubai.</TE>
<TE>   As the days passed with no word of the detainees' welfare, their
relatives pleaded with Bacha Khan to make inquiries to the Americans.
They went several times to an American air base near Khowst and begged
just to talk to the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "They would not even let us inside," Maluk said bitterly.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, we cannot trust the Americans," he said.</TE>

<DL>BAGHJAHANUMA FORT, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>About 200 fighters for one of northern Afghanistan's key warlords
laid down their weapons Monday in a ceremony their leader said may be the
first step toward broader disarmament.</LD>
<LD>   "We have turned a new page," Ata Mohammed told his soldiers marshaled
at the 120-year-old Baghjahanuma fort, about 50 miles southeast of the
main northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif. "Now is not the time for fighting,
now is the time to lay down our guns."</LD>
<LD>   U.N. officials welcomed the disarmament and an agreement reached
Monday between Mohammed and a senior aide to rival commander Gen. Rashid
Dostum on security in a northern village.</LD>
<TE>   But the agreement was limited to just one village, Khulm, and a senior
U.N. official cautioned that Monday's ceremony was a gesture rather than
an indication that tensions had eased between ethnic groups in the north.</TE>

<HD>Iraq, U.N. Chief to Discuss Arms Dispute</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Annan will meet foreign minister, but diplomats expect
little progress on weapons inspections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>Iraq's foreign minister will meet with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in New York next week to discuss Security Council demands for
weapons inspections, U.N. officials announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "The secretary-general expects to have a focused discussion on the
implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions, including
the return of U.N. weapons inspectors to Iraq," a U.N. spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting with Annan was formally requested by Iraq and the Arab
League last month. Naji Sabri, the Iraqi foreign minister, will travel to
New York for the one-day meeting and will then leave for an Arab League
summit in Beirut, U.N. officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Expectations for the meeting are minimal, however, with diplomats here
saying that the Iraqis have given no sign of dropping their objections to
weapons inspections.</TE>
<TE>   And despite deep disagreements within the Security Council over U.S.
threats of possible military action against Iraq, the permanent council
members are united in their position that Saddam Hussein's government
must fully comply with resolutions requiring cooperation with the U.N.
inspection unit that it expelled more than three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the conversation should be very short," said a senior U.S.
official here. "All they have to do is say that they will comply."</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council unanimously agreed in November to adopt a new
U.S.-backed trade sanctions plan against Iraq that would streamline
import procedures for most products while intensifying restrictions on
goods with possible military applications. It is to take effect in June.</TE>
<TE>   Bitterly opposed by Iraq, the plan aims to increase pressure on the
country to admit weapons inspectors, while reducing international
opposition to the sanctions on humanitarian grounds. Technical
consultants from Russia and the United States have been finishing work on
a detailed list of hundreds of specific items the Iraqis will not be
allowed to buy without U.N. permission.</TE>
<TE>   Although Iraq asked for the meeting, officials in Baghdad balked at
Annan's proposal of the March 7 date, diplomats here said. The Iraqis had
hoped to postpone discussions until after the mid-March meeting of the
Arab League; Iraq has asked the group to condemn the U.N. trade
constraints.</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraqis were told that if they were serious about having a
discussion, it would be better to have it sooner than later," said a U.N.
official who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi officials could not be reached for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Anxious to forestall a U.S. military strike, diplomats from Russia,
France, China and Arab nations have been actively urging the Iraqis to
open their doors to inspectors before the new sanctions go into effect,
officials here said. Leaders of these countries have also publicly
criticized U.S. warnings of possible military action against Iraq and
opposed efforts to apply new global counter-terrorism initiatives against
Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "We are well aware of the countries whose citizens fought with the
Taliban in Afghanistan and provided financing for them--and Iraq is not
on that list," Russian President Vladimir V. Putin said in Moscow
recently. "But this does not mean the international community does not
have any problems with Iraq. With our partners in the United Nations and
the U.N. Security Council, we are actively discussing these issues and
looking for ways to solve them."</TE>
<TE>   Annan, speaking during a visit to London on Monday, reiterated his
oft-stated view that "any attack on Iraq at this stage would be unwise."</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqis, in recent private discussions with foreign governments,
have repeated their refusal to permit inspections unless trade penalties
are removed first, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of cynicism about the Iraqis around here right now,"
said one diplomat who has negotiated with the Iraqis in the past.</TE>

<LD>About 1,000 Internal Revenue Service computers would be shipped to
Afghanistan to help the country it rebuild its Finance Ministry under a
proposal by the Bush administration.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-year-old desktop and laptop computers, which are being phased
out at the IRS, would enable the Afghan government to better keep track
of its finances, including foreign aid, and to monitor the banking system
for evidence of money laundering and other suspicious activity.</LD>
<LD>   "The Bush administration is committed to rebuilding Afghanistan, and
this would be a creative way of doing that," Treasury Department
spokesman Rob Nichols said.</LD>
<TE>   Much of the Afghan government's equipment is out of date, some was
pillaged during years of war, and some was destroyed by the now-deposed
Taliban regime.</TE>

<HD>Terror War Budget May Fall Short</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The war in Afghanistan and the Pentagon's efforts to bolster
security at home will cost a projected $30 billion this year, far more
than Congress has provided, according to Defense Department documents
obtained by Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush and Congress have given the Pentagon $17.4 billion for
the war and the domestic fight against terrorism this fiscal year, which
ends Sept. 30. Other federal agencies have received billions more.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Department estimate means that an additional $12.6 billion
could be needed in the next seven months for the department's operations
in the U.S., Afghanistan or wherever else it may be combating terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   "If operations continue to accrue as experienced to date, available
funding will be exhausted by April or May," the 50-page report says.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is expected to ask lawmakers in March for extra money for the
conflict in Afghanistan and efforts to improve domestic security,
including at airports.</TE>
<TE>   The White House budget office has not made a final decision about how
much the administration will request for the Pentagon and other agencies.
Even so, the figure represents a first glimpse of the magnitude of
expenses that Defense Department officials believe they are facing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still working on the requests, and we will submit the
information to Congress when we're ready," said Amy Call, a spokeswoman
for the White House budget office.</TE>

<LD>Investigators probing the crash of an American Airlines jetliner
last year in New York are looking closely at a similar 1997 incident,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Airbus and American plan to remove the tail fin, or vertical
stabilizer, of an A300-600 to see if the component was damaged when it
likely endured stresses similar to those in that preceded the crash of
Flight 587 on Nov. 12, killing all 260 people on board and five on the
ground.</LD>
<LD>   That aircraft plunged into a residential area after takeoff from John
F. Kennedy International Airport. Investigators believe the tail fin and
rudder broke off as the plane neared 300 mph, causing it to crash.</LD>
<TE>   Those components were recovered from Jamaica Bay and have been at the
center of the investigation.</TE>

<HD>'Black Monday' for Travel at Salt Lake International</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Complicated by security, a crush of passengers causes
major flight delays after the close of the Games.</DH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>There were no medals for the last event at the Winter Olympics--the
marathon on Monday to leave Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   Tens of thousands of travelers trying to fly home endured huge lines
stretching from the inside of terminals to curbside arrival areas at Salt
Lake International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Waits of four hours just to reach ticket counters were common as
luggage replaced luge.</LD>
<TE>   "I have been here for 13 years and I have never seen crowds like
this," said Barbara Gann, public relations director for the city's
Department of Airports.</TE>
<TE>   Gann said it was the busiest day in the airfield's history.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, the massive getaway was called "Black Monday" as the airport
braced for as many as 74,000 passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The crush was complicated by security problems.</TE>
<TE>   The airport was shut Sunday night during the closing ceremony. Shortly
after it reopened, one of the metal detectors used to screen travelers
failed. Security officials ordered both of the airport's terminals
cleared so passengers could be screened again after the detector was
fixed.</TE>
<TE>   That resulted in delays and cancellations for some flights early
Monday. Some planes departed empty Monday as pilots were forced to take
off so they would not violate the maximum flying time under federal
regulations.</TE>
<TE>Even Medalists Waited in Line With Everyone</TE>
<TE>   As the lines grew longer, lightly dressed passengers headed for warmer
climates stood shivering in the cold as Olympic volunteers and airport
employees handed out water, hot chocolate and coffee.</TE>
<TE>   "I almost wore shorts. We packed all our warm clothes," said Greg
Picinich, who was on his way to Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   The midsize airport was swamped as buses disgorged spectators, Olympic
officials and athletes in colorful parkas. Even medalists waited in line
with everyone else. Up and down the queue, passengers who missed
connections called travel agents on cell phones seeking other flights.
One enterprising Olympic volunteer trolled the line trying to sell his
uniform for $500.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen it like this," said Susan Swenson, a gate agent for
Delta Air Lines. "I really feel bad for the passengers."</TE>
<TE>   "I was here at 4 a.m., and it was just as bad then as it is now," said
Melissa Carling, a sales clerk at one of the airport's souvenir shops.
People jammed the store in a last-ditch effort to buy pins, T-shirts,
flags, glass globes with artificial snowflakes and other
memorabilia--mostly marked down.</TE>
<TE>   "Crazy? It's insane," Carling said.</TE>
<TE>   Alessandro Trovati, a photographer based in Milan for Associated
Press, said he arrived at 5 a.m. for a 10 a.m. flight to New York.
Because of the lines, he missed the plane and finally settled for a 5
p.m. flight to Philadelphia, connecting to Boston and finally to Milan.</TE>
<TE>   "I have made many Olympics, but never seen anything like this," he
said. "In Nagano [Japan] there were no problems."</TE>
<TE>   "I've lost two days," Trovati lamented.</TE>
<TE>   Mixed in with the Olympic crowd were those who unknowingly chose the
wrong day to travel.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Bullen and his wife live in Logan, Utah, and said they avoided
Salt Lake City during the Games because of the crowds. On Monday, en
route to Palm Springs, the couple found themselves trapped at the airport
on its busiest day.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't believe the lines would be this long," Bullen said.</TE>
<TE>For a Few, Waiting Was Done With a Smile</TE>
<TE>   Most people took the delays in stride.</TE>
<TE>   "She's having a ball. She's getting out of school," said Mary
Humphrey, who returned to San Diego with her 10-year-old daughter and her
husband, who was far less patient.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband is so mad," she added. "He said that nothing we saw at the
Olympics was worth this."</TE>
<TE>   But two women from Nashville expressed a different opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "We inadvertently were directed to the front of the line. Nobody even
said anything," said Terry Lucksinger, exhibiting a triumphant but
somewhat sheepish smile. "It took only 10 minutes. We felt really bad. We
hang our heads in shame."</TE>

<HD>Priest Vows to Fight Sexual Abuse Charge</HD>
<DH>Molestation: The Boston-area pastor says he has been wrongly caught
in a sweep some compare to a witch hunt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>A priest suspended on a charge that he sexually abused a child more
than 30 years ago became the first member of the clergy here on Monday to
publicly challenge his accusers within the church, heatedly denying the
allegations and declaring that he will fight to keep his job.</LD>
<LD>   "I have done nothing," Father D. George Spagnolia said at a news
conference at St. Patrick's Parish in Lowell, north of Boston.</LD>
<LD>   About 200 supporters broke into applause as their pastor, known as
Father Spag, added in slow, measured tones, "I demand due process."</LD>
<TE>   More than 80 priests from the Boston Archdiocese have been named in a
sexual abuse scandal that bubbled over early this year with the child
molestation trial and conviction of defrocked priest John J. Geoghan, now
serving nine to 10 years in prison and also awaiting trials in at least
two other criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   Spagnolia's forceful denial comes amid concerns that the impulse to
publicly purge the church of known pedophiles may lead to false
accusations--and even, some fear, a potential witch hunt. The Boston
Archdiocese began providing names of alleged abusers within the clergy
after documents associated with the Geoghan case revealed that church
officials shielded many priests known to have molested children.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the church merely moved the priests from one parish to
another--a practice known euphemistically as "the geographic cure." In at
least 70 cases, the archdiocese here has settled millions of dollars in
child sexual abuse claims.</TE>
<TE>   Some charges date back more than 40 years. Some priests are alleged to
have committed multiple molestations. Others, such as Spagnolia, are
charged with a single act of child sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College theology professor Thomas Groome, a former priest, said
Monday that he was "amazed" that no one has come forward sooner to
challenge charges that may have been festering for decades.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure one of the reasons, God help us, was that the evidence was
there," Groome said. "But I would imagine that where the accusations had
been made and never established or verified--especially when the acts
were supposed to have taken place 20, 30 years ago--that not all of these
charges are true."</TE>
<TE>   The rush to "make up for years where we didn't have sufficient
oversight could go to the other extreme," warned Groome, adding: "Whether
it's Taliban prisoners or pedophile priests, we can never suspend
people's civil rights."</TE>
<TE>   But David Clohessy, national director of the Survivors Network of
Those Abused by Priests, said Monday from St. Louis that "it's almost
ludicrous to think that a church that has for decades erred on the side
of protecting its reputation suddenly would go to the far other extreme."</TE>
<TE>   Clohessy, who said he was abused by a priest in Missouri in the 1960s,
cautioned: "We have to remember, this isn't an overly zealous,
politically ambitious elected official who removed this priest. It's not
a money-grubbing attorney. It is the very same cardinal who for decades
kept dozens of pedophiles in place in his church."</TE>
<TE>   Boston's Cardinal Bernard F. Law, this country's most senior Roman
Catholic prelate, has consistently rebuffed demands that he step down in
the face of the scandal rocking his diocese. In Sunday's Boston Globe, a
full page of letters devoted to the controversy almost universally called
for the cardinal's ouster.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Morrissey, spokeswoman for the Boston Archdiocese, did not
return calls Monday seeking a comment in the Spagnolia matter.</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference Monday, Spagnolia denounced the "zero
tolerance" policy toward sexual abuse in the clergy adopted last month by
the Boston archdiocese. Church officials here agreed to forward the names
of priests accused of sexual misconduct to law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that a single, perhaps questionable charge of sexual abuse
could end a priest's career, Spagnolia said, "As evil as the abuse of a
child is, do we respond to that evil with another evil?"</TE>
<TE>   Spagnolia said he informed the cardinal via certified letter that he
intends to fight his removal from his parish duties. He also invited the
cardinal to produce proof that a review committee from within the
archdiocese followed church procedure by investigating the claim before
stripping him of his post.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that ultimately, this case very well could go to Rome," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Spagnolia said church officials told him the allegation against him
was made Feb. 16 and allegedly took place 31 years ago, when he worked at
a church in Boston's Roxbury section.</TE>
<TE>   With his suspension Friday, Spagnolia became the 10th priest in the
Boston archdiocese to be removed from active duty after allegations of
sexual abuse of a minor.</TE>
<TE>   "I and many others believe that this policy is unjust and inherently
evil in its implementation," Spagnolia said. "I cannot stand by mute and
allow this injustice to continue unchecked."</TE>
<TE>   Spagnolia's decision to fight back may in fact bode well for the
church, said Groome, author of a new book called "What Makes Us
Catholic."</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, priests are talking back and hiring lawyers, and
saying to their own church, 'Hey, you can't just push us around,' "
Groome said. "I think there will be such a thing as public due process
within the church."</TE>
<TE>   The uproar in the Catholic community here has rippled throughout the
country as other diocesan officials comb through charges of sexual abuse
by priests.</TE>
<TE>   In nearby Manchester, N.H., for example, the names of 14 priests
accused of sexually abusing children were given to state prosecutors this
month as a direct result of the attention given the issue in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   In Tucson, the Catholic Diocese said Monday it may have to borrow
money to pay off a settlement reached in 11 lawsuits alleging four
priests molested boys.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of the settlement has not been disclosed, but a spokesman
said most of it would have to be borrowed or come from surpluses in the
diocese's parishes or from donations.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for victims of clerical sexual abuse, meanwhile, have
welcomed the notice given to a problem that for years went virtually
unreported.</TE>
<TE>   "I would caution this priest and his followers that if he is innocent,
that will emerge over time," said Clohessy.</TE>
<TE>   "There are few things worse than being falsely accused of child
molestation," he conceded. "But one thing I guarantee you is worse, and
it is being molested."</TE>

<LD>Andrea Yates considered stabbing her five children but decided it
was too bloody and drowning was a better way to end their lives, a
psychiatrist testified.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Melissa Ferguson said Yates also ruled out drugs to kill her
children, but believed drugs were possible for suicide. Ferguson
interviewed Yates in jail the day after her children were drowned.</LD>
<LD>   Ferguson testified that Yates told her she thought about killing her
children for at least three months and thought about it the night before
the children were drowned.</LD>
<TE>   Ferguson described how Yates believed she had been marked by Satan and
said that Yates told her killing her children was the right thing to do.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A juror in a murder case in Cincinnati was sent to jail for seven
days for going on vacation to Mexico in the middle of deliberations.</LD>
<LD>   Christine Fiorini, 33, failed to show up after the long Presidents Day
weekend, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. Deliberations were put
on hold for a week while court officials tried to track her down.</LD>
<LD>   Fiorini surfaced Monday and was taken before the judge presiding over
the trial.</LD>
<TE>   "You'll have to sit there for seven days with all of the other
knuckleheads up there, see what it's like. It's not a great place," Judge
Robert Ruehlman told her.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorini told the judge she thought he would be able to use the jury's
alternate. Ruehlman had dismissed the alternate before deliberations
began and after asking jurors whether there was any reason they could not
complete the case.</TE>

<LD>After a storm of criticism over the Pentagon's new strategic
information office, President Bush vowed that Washington will not lie to
Americans about defense policy.</LD>
<LD>   Bush made his promise as Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld ordered
the Pentagon to study whether the office should be scrapped based on
concern that the military might use it to spread false information to
foreign journalists and others to bolster U.S. policy.</LD>
<LD>   Bush was asked at a White House photo opportunity whether he had told
Rumsfeld to get rid of the Office of Strategic Information, formed after
the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't even need to tell him this; he knows how I feel about this,"
the president said.</TE>

<HD>Divisions Multiply Over Bush Energy Plan</HD>
<DH>Politics: As a congressional debate nears, a huge lobbying effort
intensifies and factions are exposed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>From the White House to the airwaves, the battle over energy policy
heated up Monday as the Senate prepared for a debate that will expose
divisions both between and within the parties.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists, labor unions, business groups and the White House
escalated their pressure on wavering lawmakers who will cast the deciding
votes on questions such as oil drilling in the Alaskan wilderness or
requiring auto manufacturers to increase the fuel efficiency of cars and
trucks.</LD>
<LD>   "As long as this takes to move through the Senate--and God knows how
long that is going to be--you are going to see increased intensity and
increased activity from both camps," said business lobbyist Bruce Josten,
a leader of the Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth, an
industry-labor coalition supporting the Bush administration's energy
plan.</LD>
<TE>   Betsy Loyless, political director of the League of Conservation
Voters, said the fight against the plan "is the biggest environmental
[lobbying] effort in over a decade. There is an enormous grass-roots
effort going on around this country."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, whom environmentalists have accused of overemphasizing
production in the energy plan he introduced last year, sought Monday to
highlight the initiative's conservation side at an event featuring
fuel-efficient hybrid cars parked on a White House driveway. Bush touted
tax credits and federal research subsidies meant to encourage the
development of cars that run on hydrogen-powered fuel cells or alternate
between gas and electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Energy and Economic Growth alliance and the Sierra Club
have been financing competing radio messages aimed at influencing
senators considered swing votes. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers
is funding radio ads that feature a suburban couple ridiculing the effort
to require improved gas mileage on sport-utility vehicles. And
environmentalists enlisted attorney Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the son of the
late Democratic presidential candidate, to call talk shows in the hope of
generating opposition to drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate debate could begin as soon as Wednesday. Most of the
maneuvering leading up to it has followed familiar partisan lines, with
Republicans generally lining up with business and Democrats with
environmentalists. But there have been some surprises, such as the role
being played by some big labor unions in the debate.</TE>
<TE>   Two locals in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the main
union supporting Bush's call for drilling in the Arctic because of its
job-generating potential, placed an ad earlier this month in a Florida
newspaper attacking Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) for his strong
opposition to the exploration proposal. Kerry is exploring a race for the
2004 Democratic presidential nomination; Florida has obviously
demonstrated itself to be a key state in presidential politics.</TE>
<TE>   To underscore their point, Teamsters' officials have hinted that they
may also take out ads criticizing Kerry in Iowa, traditionally the site
of the first nominating contest.</TE>
<TE>   The ad accuses Kerry of opposing drilling in Alaska but supporting it
off the coast of Florida, where it is unpopular. David Wade, Kerry's
spokesman, said the ad is wrong and that the senator opposes drilling off
the Florida coast. The Sierra Club is preparing an ad defending Kerry
that it hopes to place in the same Florida newspaper, the Tampa Tribune,
by the end of this week.</TE>
<TE>   The United Auto Workers union is a key foe of a major aspect of the
Democratic alternative to Bush's plan. A provision of the Democratic
bill, drafted by Kerry and Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), would
require passenger cars and SUVs to average 35 miles per gallon by 2013.
Passenger cars currently must meet a "corporate average fuel economy"--or
CAFE--standard of 27.5 mpg. Sport-utility vehicles and light trucks are
permitted to meet an average of 20.7 mpg.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists view the proposed increase as the single most
important step Congress can take to cut U.S. dependence on foreign oil
and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas linked to global warming.
But the UAW, though open to some fuel economy increase, believes the
Kerry-Hollings bill would disproportionately hurt domestic auto
manufacturers and thus "directly threatens the jobs of thousands of UAW
members," as the union put it in a recent statement.</TE>
<TE>   During the congressional recess last week, the union jointly sponsored
rallies with auto companies at plants in Michigan, Georgia, Louisiana and
Missouri--all of which have Democratic senators considered potential
votes against the Hollings-Kerry proposal. And workers at a
DaimlerChrysler plant in Newark, Del., are circulating a petition they
plan to send to Sen. Thomas Carper (D-Del.), another swing vote on the
fuel-standard provision.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Democratic caucus is significantly divided on the issue,"
said Alan Reuther, the UAW's legislative director.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the same Democratic senators, along with Republican
moderates, are facing cross-pressures from environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Sierra Club targeted nine senators--including Democrats
Zell Miller and Max Cleland of Georgia and Republicans Gordon Smith of
Oregon and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania--in radio ads. The ads argued
that raising the fuel economy standards was a better way to deal with the
nation's energy problems than drilling in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   Loyless said environmentalists also are "generating thousands of calls
and e-mails into Senate offices."</TE>
<TE>   The Energy and Economic Growth alliance paid for radio ads in 14
states that touted drilling in the Alaskan refuge. Josten said the group
is following up with grass-roots activity and will decide Friday whether
to sponsor more ads.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most intriguing ads in the battle, financed by the Alliance
for Automobile Manufacturers, is targeted at the call for improved
fuel-economy standards for SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   "The government wants to take away my SUV," the fictional Sally says
to her husband, Joe, in one of the ads. "The Senate can change laws, but
they can't change reality. People need SUVs."</TE>
<TE>   The ads recall the health insurance industry's famed "Harry and
Louise" campaign, in which a fictional couple sat at the kitchen table
berating Clinton's 1994 health care reform legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has not signaled its position on the plans to
increase fuel economy standards, though most participants believe it
would oppose increases as large as Kerry and Hollings are urging. But the
administration is working energetically to build support for drilling in
the Alaska refuge and the larger push for increased domestic energy
production.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Bush highlighted conservation Monday, he made clear that his
priorities extend to the other side of the energy equation. "Any sound
comprehensive energy policy must both increase production and reduce
consumption," he said.</TE>

company or an employee gets to decide whether a workplace represents a
danger to a worker's health.</LD>
<LD>   The case has drawn intense interest from gay rights and women's rights
activists as well as from corporate lawyers.</LD>
<LD>   The workers' advocates say that individuals with HIV, heart ailments
or other medical conditions should not be excluded from jobs simply
because the employer believes that the workplace could expose them to
danger.</LD>
<TE>   Corporate lawyers say they fear that companies will be sued--or even
prosecuted criminally--if they put a sick worker into what they consider
to be an unsafe environment.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of interest in this case among employers because this
happens a lot," said Robin C. Conrad, a lawyer for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The chamber and other business groups had urged the high court to
reconsider a pro-worker decision written by Judge Stephen Reinhardt in
Los Angeles for the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   It came in the case of Mario Echazabal, 56, a maintenance worker at
the Chevron oil refinery near Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1972, Echazabal had worked for a private contractor at the
refinery. In 1995, he sought a full-time job with Chevron and was hired,
pending a physical exam.</TE>
<TE>   The company's doctor found that Echazabal had hepatitis C, a chronic,
noninfectious liver ailment. Chevron revoked the job offer and barred
Echazabal from the plant, claiming that exposure to chemicals and
solvents there could endanger his health.</TE>
<TE>   Echazabal sued the company under the Americans with Disabilities Act,
contending that the company unfairly discriminated against him because of
his liver disease.</TE>
<TE>   "No one questioned he was qualified for the job. He had done the work
for years," said Echazabal's lawyer, Larry Minsky of Cerritos. "And he's
fine and has no symptoms. But he was out of a job."</TE>
<TE>   Minsky found two medical experts who said Echazabal's health would not
be endangered by the refinery job. Dr. Gary Gitnick, an expert on liver
diseases at the UCLA School of Medicine, said Echazabal's liver was
functioning and that he had "no greater risk of injuring himself" at the
refinery than did other workers.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, a federal judge sided with Chevron and threw out
Echazabal's claim before a trial.</TE>
<TE>   When Echazabal appealed, the 9th Circuit Court sided with him on a 2-1
vote. In his decision, Reinhardt noted that the ADA says employers may
not discriminate against a "qualified individual with a disability"
except when the prospective worker would pose a "direct threat to
others."</TE>
<TE>   Echazabal's liver ailment did not pose a threat to others; the only
danger was to himself, Reinhardt said. Moreover, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass.) and other sponsors of the ADA made it clear that the
legislation prohibited employers from making hiring or firing decisions
based on "paternalistic concerns" about a worker's heath, Reinhardt
noted.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court said much the same in 1991 when it ruled that the
managers of a plant that made car batteries could not exclude female
workers on the grounds that a potential fetus could be exposed to danger
there.</TE>
<TE>   In their appeal, lawyers for Chevron said "the absurd result in this
case will cost workers' lives and force unwilling employers to be
complicit in their injuries." They relied in part on a strong dissent by
Judge Stephen Trott, who called Reinhardt's conclusion "bizarre." Trott
said the ruling apparently means that a saw plant worker with "narcolepsy
or epilepsy must be allowed to operate a power saw, and a person allergic
to bees is entitled to be hired as a beekeeper."</TE>
<TE>   The justices will hear arguments in the case of Chevron vs. Echazabal,
00-1406, Wednesday morning. In recent rulings, the court has been
decidedly skeptical of employees' claims based on the ADA.</TE>
<TE>   In their briefs, the two sides differ on what liability an employer
might face.</TE>
<TE>   Chevron's lawyers say that under California law, the company's
managers could be sued, and perhaps even jailed, if they knowingly expose
a sick worker to potentially dangerous chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   But Echazabal's lawyers say that employers who take "all reasonable
steps" to warn a worker of a danger cannot be held at fault if a
determined employee later gets sick or dies from the exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Business leaders do not take comfort from that concession.</TE>
<TE>   "'This puts employers in a terrible dilemma. No matter what they say,
employers are going to look guilty if they put someone in a job who later
suffers severe injury," said Fred W. Alvarez, a Palo Alto attorney who
filed a brief on behalf of the Employers Group, a coalition of California
companies.</TE>
<TE>   But Matthew A. Coles, who heads the ACLU's Lesbian and Gay Rights
Project, said the final decision should be left to the individual. "Every
job involves some risks, and the question is: Do we let people make those
risk assessments for themselves, or do we let employers decide?"</TE>
<TE>   Since losing his job at the refinery, Echazabal had been working part
time as a school bus driver, his lawyer said. On Wednesday, however, he
plans to be at the Supreme Court to hear the argument in his case.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the high court refused Monday to hear a claim by Indiana
state officials who sought to erect a 7-foot monument with the Ten
Commandments on state grounds. Judges had barred the display as an
unconstitutional "establishment of religion" (O'Bannon vs. Indiana Civil
Liberties Union, 01-966).</TE>

<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.
</DL>
<LD>A pharmacist has reached a plea bargain on charges that he diluted
chemotherapy drugs for cancer patients, his attorney said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Jean Paul Bradshaw, the lawyer, declined to specify what type of plea
Robert R. Courtney would enter. But he said in "a case like this, it
would be unusual for the government to agree to anything less than to a
straight-out guilty plea."</LD>
<LD>   Bradshaw said Courtney's plea addresses sentencing, but he declined to
elaborate. The sentence will ultimately be decided by U.S. District Judge
Ortrie Smith.</LD>
<TE>   Courtney had pleaded not guilty to all 20 charges. A change of plea
hearing has been scheduled for today in federal court. If convicted on
all charges, Courtney faced up to 196 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment. Earlier this month,
prosecutors indicated that additional charges were possible.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney has been jailed since Aug. 15, when he turned himself in.</TE>

<HD>Auditors Put New Spin on Revolt Over Royalties</HD>
<DH>Music: Some artists are enlisting outside help to scrutinize their
labels' accounting practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As fans rush to record stores for their favorite stars' new CDs,
some artists behind the music are getting themselves auditors to make
sure they don't get shortchanged by their labels.</LD>
<LD>   Many musicians and their managers are seeking outside help in
challenging royalty formulas and contracts that they--and a few
courts--have said are denying them their fair share of the profits.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, shortly before her death, torch singer Peggy Lee and as
many as 300 other performers obtained a proposed $4.75-million settlement
in a class-action suit that accused their record company of cheating them
out of royalties dating back to the 1940s.</LD>
<TE>   Before Lee, the Ronettes, a '60s group, won a similar judgment, as did
rock singer Meat Loaf, whose music label paid him an estimated $10
million to drop his royalty suit. Other stars claiming to have been
shortchanged in royalties include the Dixie Chicks, Merle Haggard, Tom
Petty, John Fogerty, Don Henley, Courtney Love, Tom Waits and the estates
of Billie Holiday, Patsy Cline and Buddy Holly.</TE>
<TE>   This week, as the annual Grammy Awards ceremony approaches, the war
over royalties is intensifying. Tonight the Eagles, Sheryl Crow and a
dozen other stars will take the stage at four sold-out benefit concerts
organized by the Recording Artists Coalition to raise funds to lobby
lawmakers for fairer record contracts and to clean up accounting
practices.</TE>
<TE>   The five major music conglomerates--Vivendi Universal, Sony,
Bertelsmann, EMI and AOL Time Warner--say they pay artists accurate
royalties based on time-honored industry accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   The recording labels say accounting errors have occurred
unintentionally and that, on occasion, the companies have negotiated
settlements simply to keep important artists happy.</TE>
<TE>   Record companies say their royalty departments do not plot to cheat
artists. They say they pay accurate royalties based on provisions in
recording contracts, which each artist voluntarily signs. The companies
contend that many of their differences with artists stem from
interpretations of what the contracts specify.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the problems we detect are contractually permissible," said
Nevada accountant Phil Ames, who has been performing royalty audits for
three decades. "All of these artificial deductions are embedded in the
contract."</TE>
<TE>   Auditors at the dozen firms that specialize in this field say some
record labels routinely fleece artists of millions in unpaid royalties.</TE>
<TE>   "Record companies use questionable accounting tactics and contractual
provisions to get away with unconscionable things," said accountant Wayne
Coleman, whose St. Louis firm has recovered more than $100 million in
unpaid royalties for clients, including Haggard. "Of the thousands of
royalty compliance audits I've conducted over the past 30 years, I can
recall only one instance where the artist owed money to the company."</TE>
<TE>   These accounting practices are about to be scrutinized by lawmakers.
State Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver City) plans to introduce a bill this
year to penalize record labels that purposely underpay royalties--making
it a crime punishable by a $100,000 fine. Murray said he expects to hold
hearings in Sacramento by May.</TE>
<TE>   These political moves follow lawsuits filed in the last year by Love
and the Dixie Chicks against their record companies, Vivendi Universal
and Sony. The suits accused the companies of engaging in "systematic
thievery" to "swindle" them and other acts out of millions of dollars in
royalty earnings with "corrupt" accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   The record companies deny the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Outside auditors acknowledge that some in their business submit
inflated royalty claims to music companies. They also say not all record
companies treat their clients unfairly or are unwilling to open their
books.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never had a problem with Universal and wouldn't put them in
the same category as other record companies," said Coleman, who has done
consulting for Vivendi Universal.</TE>
<TE>   But others are not so generous in their assessments. They accuse all
five major companies of, at times, impeding audits by refusing to turn
over proper documents, an allegation the companies deny.</TE>
<TE>   Auditors say they often catch music corporations overcharging artists
for in-house label services and underreporting sales figures,
particularly overseas. It's not uncommon, accountants say, to uncover a
10% to 30% underpayment of royalties in an audit. And a typical audit can
cost $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, rock singer Meat Loaf sued Cleveland International, a
small Ohio record label that signed him to a contract in 1977 and, with
Sony's Epic Records, manufactured and distributed "Bat Out of Hell,"
which became one of the best-selling pop albums.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the 1980s, Meat Loaf suspected more copies of "Bat Out of
Hell" were being sold than his record company acknowledged. The singer's
suspicions were confirmed in 1991 after SoundScan, an independent
computerized sales tracking system, began tabulating store sales. The
first week that Billboard published SoundScan charts, Meat Loaf's
14-year-old album was in the top 50. By 1993, SoundScan had tracked 3
million sales of "Bat Out of Hell" in the U.S. alone.</TE>
<TE>   Meat Loaf sued Cleveland International and Sony, alleging that its
Epic division sold more than 25 million copies of the album and owed him
an estimated $14 million in unpaid royalties. The case was resolved with
an out-of-court settlement estimated at nearly $10 million, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Rocker Tom Petty said he routinely audits his record companies after
every new release. "I personally have turned up millions of dollars
missing [in royalties]--money that I would not have been paid without an
audit." Petty said he reached royalty settlements with his record
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Under most recording contracts, a music company does not pay royalties
until it recovers funds paid to the artist to cover studio recording
expenses, plus radio promotion, tour support and living expenses. The
record labels also deduct for packaging and promotional giveaways before
paying royalties.</TE>
<TE>   The record industry prohibits auditing of crucial manufacturing and
distribution documents, making it difficult to determine how many CDs are
sold, bartered for radio airplay or discount-priced through record clubs.
Auditors say record companies began inserting restrictive audit
provisions into recording contracts in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Another restriction prevents an auditor from performing more than one
audit at a time per record label. Contracts typically give artists and
their managers a window of only three years after the release of a record
to initiate an audit.</TE>
<TE>   Even after an audit, getting a record label to pay is another matter.</TE>
<TE>   "The company holds my money for five years and I pay an auditor to
collect it," said Haggard, who has paid for audits of several record
companies. "[My auditor] catches them cheating me out of hundreds of
thousands of dollars and then the company offers to pay me half of what
they owe--with no interest. What's wrong with this picture?"</TE>
<TE>   Under most contracts, if an artist catches the company failing to pay
proper royalties, the musician must pay for legal expenses. And if the
act wins the case, the company has 30 days to pay the royalties before an
act can break its deal.</TE>
<TE>   "The companies play this 'catch-us-if-you-can' game with artist
royalties," said Sherman Oaks accountant Fred Wolinsky. "It's not like
they sit down and scheme how to take advantage of everybody. But the
systems are designed to impede. They're archaic and the royalty staffs
are lean. Only artists with muscle really have the ability to get their
money."</TE>

<HD>16 Tax Assessors Arrested; Huge N.Y. Racket Alleged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Sixteen tax assessors were arrested Monday for allegedly taking
part in a 35-year plot to accept bribes and cheat New York City out of
hundreds of millions of dollars in property tax revenue, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   An indictment accused the assessors of accepting at least $10 million
in bribes and expensive meals to alter the assessed values of more than
500 properties worth a total of $8 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Two alleged bribe payers--both former assessors--were also accused in
the plot that led to an indictment accusing the defendants of
racketeering, bribery and fraud. The indictment seeks the forfeiture of
the lost revenue and the $10 million allegedly obtained through bribes.</LD>
<TE>   "These folks sold their office and sold out the people of New York,"
U.S. Atty. James Comey said. "In doing so, they undermined a bedrock of
this city's finances--a fair and honest tax assessment system."</TE>
<TE>   Federal and city officials said the scheme could be the largest theft
in city history. Almost half of the 36-member Manhattan tax assessor
staff was implicated.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, the scheme has cost the city about $160 million in lost
tax revenue, Comey said.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty percent of the city's budget comes from property tax revenue,
and the loss of taxes probably cheated the public of new schools and
better roads and services, FBI Assistant Director Barry Mawn said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was getting a piece of the pie. They were protecting one
another," Mawn said.</TE>

<HD>Mentally Ill Killer Gains Clemency</HD>
<DH>Law: Alexander Williams IV's life was spared because of his
delusions and his age at the time of the murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a rare decision, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles on
Monday commuted the death sentence of a delusional killer and ordered him
to serve life without parole.</LD>
<LD>   The five-member board spared the life of Alexander Williams IV just
hours before a stay of execution it had granted last week was set to
expire.</LD>
<LD>   This is the first time that the Georgia board has granted clemency to
a condemned murderer when his mental health was at issue and only the
third time in the nation over the last 25 years, according to the Death
Penalty Information Center.</LD>
<TE>   Since 1977, the start of the modern death penalty era in the United
States, 760 individuals have been executed and 48 have had death
sentences commuted to life.</TE>
<TE>   The Georgia board acted after hearing from three psychiatrists who
examined Williams for about three hours on Thursday at the state prison
in Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had been on death row for nearly 16 years. His case had drawn
international attention because of his mental illness and the fact that
he committed murder at the age of 17.</TE>
<TE>   Most nations ban executions of individuals for crimes committed as
juveniles. The American Bar Assn., the European Union, Amnesty
International, the National Mental Health Assn. and former First Lady
Rosalynn Carter are among those who urged mercy for Williams.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, the Supreme Court barred the execution of murderers who have
become so insane that they do not know they are about to be killed, nor
the reason for it. But the high court has never ruled on the issue of
whether it is permissible to execute an inmate who is medicated to
achieve a minimum level of sanity. Williams, who has been diagnosed as a
"chronic paranoid schizophrenic," has been forcibly medicated at times in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The pardons board, which has the exclusive power to grant clemency in
Georgia, did not disclose its vote Monday, nor did it provide any details
on what led to the decision.</TE>
<TE>   However, the board expressed its "deepest sympathy for the family of
[murder victim] Aleta Bunch and especially her mother Carolyn Bunch," who
has strongly supported an execution for Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Now 33, Williams robbed, raped and murdered Bunch, a 16-year-old high
school student, after kidnapping her at an Augusta, Ga., mall, where the
girl had gone to buy her mother a birthday present.</TE>
<TE>   "The pain and devastation that Williams caused this family can never
be erased," said pardons board chairman Walter Ray. "By making sure that
Williams will remain in an 8-by-10 [foot] prison cell for the rest of his
life with absolutely no hope for parole, we hope that the certainty of
our decision will give Mrs. Bunch the closure she so deserves," Ray
added.</TE>
<TE>   The victim's mother said she was disappointed. "I don't think the
pardon board had any feelings about my daughter's life," Carolyn Bunch
said from her South Carolina home.</TE>
<TE>   "She had just turned 16," Bunch said. "She worked two part-time jobs
and went to school full time. I just don't think they were looking at
what we have gone through for 16 years. She was a beautiful young person.
There wasn't anybody who met her who didn't love her. That is my one
consolation."</TE>
<TE>   Numerous reports over the last dozen years by prison doctors and
psychologists have described Williams as severely mentally ill and "out
of touch with reality," and said that he believed actress Sigourney
Weaver is God. As recently as late January, a prison doctor described him
as "delusional."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' lead lawyer, Mark A. Olive, praised the board's action. "We
sincerely thank the board for this merciful decision. We also thank the
thousands of people locally, nationally and internationally who chose to
speak now for abused and mentally infirm children," he said.</TE>
<TE>   William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International USA,
also applauded the decision, saying that the life sentence "balances
accountability with justice."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen B. Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights,
said that in addition to the killer's mental condition and age at the
time of the crime, he thought the board was swayed by poor representation
provided Williams by court-appointed trial lawyer O.L. Collins. Collins
was later removed from the list of lawyers eligible to represent
defendants in death penalty cases in Richmond County, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   As a youth, Williams was frequently beaten by his mother and
grandmother and sexually assaulted by his stepfather, according to court
documents. But Collins did not tell the jury anything about Williams'
childhood during the penalty phase of the trial. Five jurors who
sentenced Williams to death submitted affidavits to the pardons board
saying they would have voted for a life term if they had known his
history.</TE>
<TE>   "The board's action is a step forward," Bright said. "I think it is
part of an emerging consensus that execution of the mentally ill is every
bit as objectionable as executing the mentally retarded."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia banned execution of the mentally retarded after the
controversial execution of Jerome Bowden, who was examined by a
board-hired psychiatrist in 1986 to see how well he understood his
pending electrocution.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia was one of the first two states in the nation to bar execution
of the mentally retarded. Fifteen of the 38 states with capital
punishment laws prohibit execution of the mentally retarded.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Supreme Court, in a Virginia case, heard arguments on
whether executions of the mentally retarded violate the Constitution's
prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. A ruling is expected by
the end of June.</TE>

<HD>Riordan Strategists Turn Right</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>With one week to go and a new poll showing a tight race, the three
major candidates in the Republican gubernatorial campaign turned to their
endgames Monday, reaching out to the conservative voters who may make the
difference next Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Riordan, Bill Simon Jr. and Bill Jones plan to retool their ad
strategies day by day, and the Riordan and Simon campaigns are polling
nightly to figure out which messages are getting through to voters and
which are not.</LD>
<LD>   That task is vital to all three contenders, but it is particularly
important to Riordan, who according to the latest Times poll, has seen
his once-commanding lead slip away into a virtual tie. As a result, the
former Los Angeles mayor now has the job of turning around his fortunes
in the next seven days.</LD>
<TE>   Riordan, who has irked conservatives by trumpeting his moderate views
on abortion, gay rights and other social issues, pivoted Monday with a
discernible rightward shift, particularly on crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Let there be no doubt, I support the death penalty," he said at a
peace officers monument outside the state Capitol. Riordan also
highlighted his efforts at fighting crime in Los Angeles and noted that a
prominent group of California prosecutors was supporting his bid for
governor.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's need to solidify conservative support is largely the result
of the unusual campaign that incumbent Gov. Gray Davis has waged against
him in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has inserted himself into the GOP primary with a withering ad
campaign against Riordan--challenging the former mayor on abortion and
the death penalty, among other issues. Davis plans to stay in the mix
with more than $1 million worth of spots running statewide until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll finish with a flourish," said Davis strategist Garry South.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis ads have scrambled the dynamics of the GOP primary, giving a
boost to the Simon campaign at Riordan's expense. And even if Riordan
wins the primary, Davis will have forced him to spend so much on
television ads during the primary that he will be left "flat out of
money" for the general election race, South said.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly threw a skunk into the Republican picnic, didn't we?"
South said.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the Davis strategy has raised questions about
whether Riordan, a multimillionaire, would spend his own money to win. If
Riordan does reach into his own pocket, it might make it harder for him
to tap others for support because they could see him as a self-supported
candidate. On Monday, however, Riordan said he would not put any of his
own money into the race before Tuesday's primary.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Riordan bought $1 million worth of television ads for the
final week, enough to sustain substantial exposure statewide, according
to political director Kevin Spillane. That was helped by a late $500,000
donation from American Sterling Corp., a banking and mortgage lending
company based in the Kansas City, Mo., area.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of the Davis ad blitz was apparent at Riordan's campaign
event Monday in a park across from the state Capitol. Riordan rebutted
charges in Davis' ads that he flip-flopped on the death penalty and that
crime rose on his watch as mayor. (Crime, in fact, declined markedly
during Riordan's two terms, though it increased somewhat in his final
year.)</TE>
<TE>   He recalled that he backed the effort to remove liberal Rose Bird from
the state Supreme Court, largely because she would not enforce capital
punishment. Riordan also accepted the endorsement of the California Assn.
of Deputy Attorneys General.</TE>
<TE>   "A safe California will be my No. 1 concern," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a Sacramento radio interview, Riordan also distanced himself from
his longtime support for gun control laws. He said he supports
restrictions on "automatic assault weapons and Saturday night specials,"
but supports the right to bear arms.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably have too many laws on the books on guns right now,"
Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Spillane said Riordan was simply returning to core Republican primary
issues for the final week: public safety, energy, the economy and fiscal
management.</TE>
<TE>   Not content to simply voice those views, the Riordan campaign also was
preparing to step up its advertising assault against Simon in an effort
to stop the novice candidate's upward momentum. Aides said a new
15-second television ad would question Simon's credentials as a
Republican, quoting news reports that Simon was registered to vote as an
independent in New York and did not register to vote while living in New
Jersey in the 1980s. In the radio interview, Riordan said Monday that
Simon "wasn't a Republican until nine years ago."</TE>
<TE>   For Simon, however, the latest poll findings merely affirm his current
course, and he stayed firmly on that conservative program Monday. Dashing
across the state with his marquee supporter, former New York Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani, Simon stuck to his familiar promises: no new taxes
and an improved school system.</TE>
<TE>   "We've spoken to thousands of Californians, and whether those issues
are the budget or education of our quality of life--our roads, our water
or our power--we all know these issues can be solved," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   There was some irony in Simon's renewed embrace of Giuliani, who
endorsed and campaigned for Democrats in New York. Riordan's support for
Democrats has been the main subject of Simon's attack ads; Simon asserts
he is not "ashamed" to be a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   From Orange County, Simon and Giuliani went on to campaign in
Sacramento and San Francisco. It was part of a stepped-up schedule for
Simon, who earlier in the race had few public appearances but now
regularly travels the breadth of California each day.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's lead strategist, Sal Russo, said the candidate's calendar
would continue to be full until next Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign has several additional attack ads ready to roll
against Riordan if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick Riordan's campaign has been predominantly against the Republican
Party and 'trust me, I'll tell you what I'll do after I get elected,' and
that's not a compelling message," Russo said.</TE>
<TE>   The third candidate, Secretary of State Jones, took another approach:
He lashed out at his two opponents with blistering rhetoric--the kind
that draws local television news coverage in the absence of funds for a
substantial ad campaign. Jones also touted his support by the National
Rifle Assn. and other conservative groups.</TE>
<TE>   Jones is staying largely on the attack, hammering Riordan and Simon.
Like Riordan, Jones criticized Simon on Monday for his repeated failure
to vote in local, state and federal elections. "That's just unacceptable
in a candidate for higher office," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   But on Monday, Jones devoted most of his time on the attack against
the former mayor, accusing him of mismanaging Los Angeles as mayor and
questioning his loyalty as a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan tried to make light of the three-front assault.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel," he said, "like a pinata."</TE>
