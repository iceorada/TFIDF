<HD>Honda's Unexpected Gear Shift</HD>
<DH>Some customers believe a recall should be issued for the
slipping transmissions</DH>

<LD>Matthew Veno spotted an opening in the early-morning rush-hour
traffic and stabbed the accelerator. His year-old Acura TL Type-S
surged forward, hitting close to 80 mph on Boston's Route 3. Then,
with no warning, the five-speed automatic transmission slipped from
fifth to second, pulling the car up as sharply as if he had slammed
on the brakes.</LD>
<LD>   "Fortunately, the people behind me were able to swerve, so there
wasn't an accident," the 23-year-old computer engineer recalled. "But
it could have been pretty bad."</LD>
<LD>   When Veno's $34,000 Acura spontaneously downshifted, the engine
kept racing and the crankshaft revolutions, or RPMs, went through the
roof, kicking in a limiter that cuts off the engine to avoid damage.</LD>
<TE>   "That caused even more jerkiness, and at 80 it started the car
swerving from side to side on a two-lane highway. I almost slammed
into a construction barrier," Veno said. "It was the scariest time
I've ever had in a car. If the traction control hadn't been on, I
would have lost it."</TE>
<TE>   Veno's dealer arranged for the car to be towed and replaced the
faulty transmission under warranty and without argument.</TE>
<TE>   It is one of almost 16,000 Honda and Acura automatic transmissions
American Honda Motor Co. has replaced in the last two years, leading
some owners to begin questioning the company's reputation for
building bulletproof cars.</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as Kathy Lammens, say American Honda should order an
immediate recall.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to do it for the people's sake," said the 38-year-old
Placentia resident, whose 2001 Acura CL's automatic transmission
failed completely the day after it slipped into second gear at 65 mph
on the Costa Mesa Freeway late last month.</TE>
<TE>   When the downshift occurred, Lammens said, she was heading home
from work on a fairly empty freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like I'd suddenly slammed on the brakes," she said, "but
the engine was straining.... And there was no one behind me, which is
good because the brake lights don't go on when that happens, so
there's no warning to anyone following."</TE>
<TE>   Lammens said her Acura dealer agreed immediately to replace the
transmission but told her he could not give her a completion date.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked why, and I was stunned," she said. Lammens was told she
was 27th on a regional waiting list for replacement of five-speed
automatic transmissions for late-model Acura CLs.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Spencer, a spokesman for Acura, Honda's sport-luxury
division, confirmed that there has been a "higher than normal
incidence" of problems with two Honda-built automatic transmissions.
Although many involve high-performance models such as the
260-horsepower Acura Type-S, others afflict 200-horsepower V-6 Honda
Accords and 240-horsepower Odyssey minivans not usually associated
with racing and speeding abuses.</TE>
<TE>   The two transmissions are the five-speed used in V-6-equipped
Acuras since the 2000 model year and in Honda Odysseys since the 2002
model year; and the four-speed automatic used in V-6 Honda Accords
since 2000 and in 2000 and 2001 Odysseys.</TE>
<TE>   Of 1 million vehicles sold in the U.S. with those transmissions,
Spencer said, Honda has replaced the transmissions in about 16,000,
or 1.6%.</TE>
<TE>   No accidents or injuries have been reported, and a spokesman for
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that though
the agency has received a number of Honda and Acura transmission
failure complaints, the screening staff that checks reports for
safety issues has not recommended that an investigation be opened.
Reports to the agency can be filed online at www.nhtsa.dot.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer said the number and severity of transmission problems,
though exceeding Honda's tolerance, are not enough to warrant a
recall.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has Honda issued a service bulletin to alert dealers to the
potential for trouble, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Company policy prohibits dealers from opening transmission
cases--"If there's a problem under warranty, the whole transmission
is replaced," Spencer said--and the problem transmissions cannot be
identified until the problem occurs.</TE>
<TE>   So a bulletin, which typically provides instructions for repairing
a problem when the customer takes in a vehicle for service, would do
no good.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer said Honda engineers identified the root of the problems a
few months ago and have redesigned the transmissions.</TE>
<TE>   The four-speed models were afflicted with a bad bearing that could
break apart, scattering fragments of metal that clogged fluid
passageways in the transmission, causing it to shift erratically, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The five-speed models typically were damaged by premature wear of
the third-gear clutch pack. As the clutch friction material abraded,
it scattered bits inside the transmission case, clogging fluid lines
and causing erratic shifting.</TE>
<TE>   Honda and Acura dealers are replacing affected transmissions under
warranty--typically with factory rebuilt transmissions, a standard
industry practice, Spencer said. He said customers such as Lammens
have been caught in an unusual situation because Honda has never had
a run of bad transmissions and thus has never had to stockpile
replacement parts. When the four-and five-speed automatics started
breaking, he said, a backlog quickly developed.</TE>
<TE>   "But we are trying to get parts into the system, and in the
meantime we are providing loaners at no cost so our customers won't
be without transportation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That has come in especially handy for a few Acura owners whose
cars were out of service several times before Honda engineers found
the cause of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Several on an Internet forum for Acura owners have complained of
having to replace transmissions several times before getting one that
did not self-destruct. Not all own older vehicles either.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Mincy, a Michigan real estate broker, said in an e-mail
interview that his 7-month-old 2003 Acura TL Type-S is headed back to
the dealer for its second replacement transmission.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those interviewed had no complaints about how Honda and
its dealers have treated them. But many echoed Veno, who said his
problem transmission will haunt him--and Acura--for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   "I bought this car because of the company's reputation for
quality. I was going to buy a Honda product and drive it for 250,000
miles," he said. "But now I can guarantee you that when the warranty
is up, the car is gone. And this will probably be in my mind when I
go looking for a replacement."</TE>
<TE>   Spencer said Honda is confident the problems have been solved.</TE>
<TE>   He said Honda owners with transmission concerns should call the
company's customer service hotline at (800) 999-1009; Acura owners
should call (800) 382-2238.</TE>
<TE>   "We are definitely keeping an eye on this, and if it looks like
the issue is growing, we'll take other steps" that could include
extending warranties for replacement transmissions that now are
covered only by the remainder of the original new-car powertrain
warranty of five years or 50,000 miles, Spencer said.</TE>
<TE>   That's good, said Joshua Pai, a 23-year-old electronics engineer
from Anaheim who worries about his Acura TL's longevity after its
recent transmission failure.</TE>
<TE>   "But I wish they'd do more," he said. "There's bound to be someone
in an accident because of this, and that will be terrible. They
really should recall them all."</TE>

<HD>Taking Another Look at Zero Emission Mandate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Look for the California Air Resources Board to consider a new
approach next year to its controversial Zero Emission Vehicle
Mandate.</LD>
<LD>   Insiders say the agency's staff, stung by General Motors Corp.'s
so-far-successful lawsuit to block the 2003 model year imposition of
the mandate, is reworking the plan and will present another approach
in the spring to the politically appointed board.</LD>
<LD>   The air board will appeal an injunction that GM obtained this
summer, spokesman Jerry Martin said. But while the legal maneuvering
goes on, he said, so is a new look at regulating tailpipe emissions.</LD>
<TE>   The plan is not to do away with the ZEV mandate but to make it
more responsive to technologies--such as hybrid gasoline-electric
systems and ultra-clean internal-combustion engines--that have been
developed in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   It is the auto industry's adamant refusal to pursue further
development of battery-electric technologies that has led the air
board staff to begin rethinking its ZEV approach.</TE>
<TE>   A revision of the ZEV mandate might make the air board's efforts
to regulate auto emissions more palatable to the auto industry, which
has been spending heavily to fight the present measure in Sacramento
as well as in court.</TE>
<TE>   California regulators have been at odds with auto makers in
Detroit and Japan over the ZEV program since it was launched more
than a decade ago. Because of the state's severe smog, California is
the only state allowed by the federal Clean Air Act to regulate
tailpipe exhaust.</TE>
<TE>   That authority has led to the nation's most stringent controls on
cars and light trucks--including a measure, just signed by Gov. Gray
Davis, that directs the air board to come up with new rules by 2005
that would regulate automotive emissions of so-called greenhouse
gases linked to global warming.</TE>
<TE>   The ZEV mandate that GM blocked in court would have required major
auto makers to build and offer for sale in California thousands of
zero-emission vehicles starting with the '03 model year. So far, the
only vehicles that meet the ZEV standard are the battery-powered
electrics the auto industry says are too expensive to build and too
functionally limited to interest a broad segment of the buying
public.</TE>
<TE>   GM's suit challenges the entire mandate as well as a series of
amendments that, ironically, gave auto makers flexibility in choosing
which type of cars to build. The amendments favor hybrid vehicles,
fuel-cell engines and super-clean gasoline models over
battery-powered cars. GM says the air board overstepped its authority
in approving revisions to the 12-year-old ZEV program.</TE>
<TE>   On June 14, U.S. District Judge Robert E. Coyle in Fresno issued a
temporary restraining order blocking implementation of the mandate
until the lawsuit is decided, which could take many months.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, GM and Ford Motor Co., two of only three auto makers to
offer so-called full-function electric vehicles for public use, have
pulled the plug on their programs.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota Motor Corp. says it will continue to make a few hundred of
its electric RAV4-EV compact sport utility vehicles each year for
sale or lease to the public, but the numbers are so small they barely
register in the state's vast motor pool.</TE>
<TE>   More Clean Air Models</TE>
<TE>   Good news for those who have tried to find one of Nissan's Sentra
CA (for "clean air") models: After limiting production of the
ultra-clean cars to just a few thousand since 2001, Nissan says the
special emissions system will be used on all four 1.8-liter Sentra
models sold in California and the CA designation will be dropped.</TE>
<TE>   The system combines a clean gasoline engine that meets the state's
super-ultra-low-emission- vehicle standard with equipment that traps
fumes that would evaporate from the fuel lines and gas tank on hot
days.</TE>
<TE>   The result, Nissan says, are cars that produce fewer total
emissions during a 20-mile round-trip commute than today's typical
new vehicles do with their engines off.</TE>
<TE>   The state agrees and has awarded the cars P-ZEV status--for
"partial zero-emission vehicle"--meaning their sales will earn Nissan
credit toward fulfilling the zero-emission mandate when the rules are
resurrected.</TE>

<HD>Jeep's New Mission: Ride to the Rescue, Rubicon or Not</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The venerable Jeep brand is getting a new logo and a revised mission
this week. A new advertising campaign will portray Jeeps and their
owners not so much as tough off-roaders but as highway helpers, ready
to ride to the rescue in conditions other vehicles can't handle.</LD>
<LD>   DaimlerChrysler says it no longer will adhere to the old dictum
that, to be a Jeep, it must be able to traverse Northern California's
Rubicon Trail, renowned in the off-roading world for its nonstop
ruggedness. Ironically, the new approach comes just after Jeep
launched the Wrangler Rubicon, beefed up at the factory with much of
the stuff hard-core off-roaders add on their own and priced well
below the cost of buying a new Wrangler and beefing-up in the
aftermarket.</LD>
<LD>   The new logo plays on Jeep's wartime heritage and features a
silhouette of the original folding windshield, grille and headlamps
on an Army green background.</LD>
<TE>   Jeep, which once had the off-roading crowd to itself, remains a
leader in the segment but is facing stiff competition from other
brands that are flooding the market with four-wheel-drive sport
utility vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The advertising pitch, aimed at helping to double sales over the
next decade to 800,000 vehicles a year, will present Jeep as a maker
of real off-road vehicles driven by thoughtful, patriotic buyers.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the noble liberator. It is the authentic American hero,"
said Jeff Bell, Chrysler's vice president of Jeep marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche and other Chrysler
executives have complained that the valuable Jeep brand has not been
exploited properly and have said they intend to expand the
three-model lineup as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   But a company edict--imposed in 1986 by former Chrysler President
Bob Lutz, now vice chairman of General Motors--holds that all Jeeps
must be capable of traversing the Rubicon Trail near Lake Tahoe, and
that has slowed development of new models. Rubicon-ready Jeeps need
heavy-duty components that add weight and cost and limit how many
parts Jeeps can share with other DaimlerChrysler vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   So Chrysler has decided to shift its emphasis to other measures of
Jeep prowess.</TE>
<TE>   The ad campaign will show Jeeps on off-road trails, but they also
promote "rescue capability," a term Bell said would represent the new
standard for Jeeps.</TE>
<TE>   He said the additional safety and security that goes into a true
off-road vehicle also is important in highway use.</TE>
<TE>   In one ad, three Jeeps plug a hole in a guardrail on a
rain-slicked highway just before a car speeds past it. "Jeep owners
stop and help others in duress," Bell said. "Rescue capability is our
focus."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Jeep has started selling its $24,995 Rubicon in an
effort to share in the profits that after-market, off-road shops have
been making for years.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Broomall, Jeep's product development director, estimates that
the factory modifications would cost at least $10,000 if purchased
separately and added by the owner.</TE>
<TE>   Jeep sells the Rubicon for the same price as the top-of-the-line
Wrangler Sahara, but tosses out the stock axels and transfer case in
favor of Dana 44 axels front and rear, each with a hydraulic locker
that enables the driver to lock the rear axel or the front and rear
axels in tandem with the push of a button on the dash.</TE>
<TE>   Stock tires are 31-inch rough terrain rubber, and the Rubicon
transfer case is geared down to a 4 to 1 ratio, low enough that the
manual transmission models can be maneuvered over the entire Rubicon
without using the clutch.</TE>
<TE>   The Wrangler Rubicon also carries Jeep's seven-year, 70,000-mile
limited powertrain warranty on all those beefy parts, something your
do-it-yourself conversion can't match.</TE>
<TE>   Hyundai Misstated Power</TE>
<TE>   In an unusually candid moment for an auto company, Hyundai Motor
America said Monday that it had inadvertently misstated the
horsepower rating on 1.3 million vehicles in U.S. since 1992,
understating the power output of some and overstating it for others.</TE>
<TE>   For most of those, the error was within a 4% tolerance Hyundai
officials say is permissible.</TE>
<TE>   But the variance was exceeded in about 400,000 cases, and owners
of those vehicles--nearly 20% of the cars and SUVs Hyundai has sold
in the U.S. since '92--will be offered extended warranties or
extended roadside service contracts to make up for the disappointment
of learning that their Hyundai has less power than was advertised.</TE>
<TE>   Finbarr O'Neill, president and chief executive of Fountain
Valley-based Hyundai Motor America, said the errors were caused by
lack of internal processes to communicate technical data between
engineering and marketing.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said he decided to reveal that the horsepower errors
affected 1.3 million vehicles instead of confessing to just the
400,000 most egregious cases "because it is a lot better to come to
the market and say we made a mistake, discovered the problem and this
is what it is."</TE>
<TE>   Any damage to Hyundai's reputation, he said, will be far less than
"if we became the company that buries facts like these."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said affected owners and lessees will receive a letter
from Hyundai detailing their options.</TE>
<TE>   Those who don't want to wait, he said, can call Hyundai's consumer
line at (800) 218-9797 or go to www.hyundaistatus.com.</TE>

<HD>Alloys Raise Safety Concerns</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you are one of those drivers who makes a practice of bashing into
curbs while parking, you might not want to invest in an expensive set
of alloys.</LD>
<LD>   Some experts are less than enthusiastic about the longevity of
alloys in general, and they voice concern about their tendency to
sustain damage from abrasion and their problems holding air pressure
in tires.</LD>
<LD>   An equally great concern involves the efficacy of repairing
damaged alloy wheels.</LD>
<TE>   Replacing a damaged or defective alloy wheel with a new one can be
expensive. They can range from about $100 apiece for a really basic
model to well over $500 for a complex design. Alloys come as standard
equipment on about 60% of new cars.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies, large and small, sell repaired alloys, taking your
damaged wheel in exchange and later repairing and reselling it. In
many cases, these repair businesses are providing replacements that
had only cosmetic damage, such as scuff marks. But they also sell
wheels that have been repaired after being cracked or bent.</TE>
<TE>   A consumer has no way to know how much damage a remanufactured rim
had sustained.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it is safe to repair a bent rim is questionable.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has little to
offer. The agency's Web site could not locate a single document
dealing with the issue. It does not have standards governing either
the manufacturing or the repair of alloys.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, we do not regulate repairs," a spokesman said.
Consumers basically are on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety,
said alloy wheels generally lack consistent quality and often are
subject to fractures. Ditlow said the center has received reports of
alloy wheels that are unable to retain air pressure. In cold
climates, tires mounted on alloys with a poor seal can lose
significant pressure in as little as one week.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of damaged alloys are repaired each year at a cost of
hundreds of millions of dollars, industry sources say. Insurance
companies, for instance, often will specify that body shops use
repaired alloy wheels, rather than new ones, when doing collision
repairs.</TE>
<TE>   But most consumers' problems with alloys result from road damage
from potholes, curbs or debris.</TE>
<TE>   A typical complaint came to Your Wheels from a Tustin couple, who
wrote that their 2000 Mazda MPV minivan began vibrating at high
speeds. After some unnecessary repairs, including an alignment, the
vibration was traced to a dent in an alloy wheel.</TE>
<TE>   A major national tire chain estimated the wheel would cost $400 to
replace. A smaller tire dealer offered to repair it for $250.
Finally, the couple had the wheel fixed by an independent repair
operation for $100.</TE>
<TE>   The repair industry includes small shops that do little more than
sand scuff marks off wheels and very large corporations that operate
factories that perform major repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Transwheel Corp., which describes itself as the largest vendor of
repaired alloy wheels in the country, annually repairs about 150,000
of them, according to Jim Devlin, general manager of operations.</TE>
<TE>   Devlin said the company does repair cracks and dents, but within
strict limits, and has developed its own internal standards to
determine the severity of damage that can be safety repaired. Devin
said the company removes up to 20 thousandths of an inch of metal in
some resurfacing operations, using computer-controlled machines.</TE>
<TE>   Independent tests, he said, have shown that wheels repaired to
such standards meet requirements set by car makers and by the Society
of Automotive Engineers. But such assurances do not satisfy everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Zion, owner of Automotive Collision Consultants, a private
accident investigation company in Long Beach, expressed concerns
about the use of repaired alloy wheels. In some cases,
remanufacturing companies have taken excessive amounts of aluminum
off the wheels when resurfacing them, leading to failures, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Zion also said he has had many tire-leak experiences with alloy
wheels, though none with steel wheels. In general, Zion said he would
not recommend purchasing repaired alloy wheels without knowing the
history of the wheel and the identity of the repair company.</TE>
<TE>   Although many motorists think about tire safety in these
post-Firestone recall days, wheel safety isn't such a hot topic.
Still, alloy wheels can and do fail, resulting in a loss of control
just as severe, if not more so, as if a tire had blown out.</TE>

<HD>A Giant Leap for Conspiracy Theorists</HD>
<DH>Just when you thought it was safe to consider the moon
landing a fact, a skeptic flies in its face by confronting Buzz
Aldrin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Between TV psychics talking to dead people and living pets, and
movies about crop circles, it's been a busy summer for skeptics. It
just got busier.</LD>
<LD>   The decades-old conspiracy theory that America staged its moon
landings resurfaced this week after a man confronted Apollo 11
astronaut Edwin E. "Buzz" Aldrin with that accusation at a Beverly
Hills Hotel. Bart Sibrel, 37, who describes himself as a video
producer and investigative journalist on his Web site, says he was
struck in the face by the 72-year-old astronaut after asking Aldrin
to swear on a Bible that he'd been to the moon, according to Beverly
Hills police.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, this is at least the second time Sibrel has confronted
Aldrin about setting foot on the moon. A couple years ago, Aldrin was
on a book tour when Sibrel "started ranting and raving," according to
Aldrin's wife, Lois.</LD>
<TE>   "He attacked Buzz about going to the moon. He said things I can't
repeat," she said. "He was not a nice man, and it really upset Buzz a
lot."</TE>
<TE>   Aldrin was at a meeting at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena on Tuesday and could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics wish that those who assert the 1969 Apollo moon mission
was faked would apply a little more research to their ideas. "The
claim that the moon landing is a hoax is completely crackpot," said
Kevin Christopher, a spokesman for the Skeptical Inquirer magazine
based in Buffalo, N.Y. "It's just crazy. The scientific evidence is
overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   Aldrin's widely reported run-in hasn't generated many calls
related to the space program--yet. Instead, Christopher said, he's
spent a good part of his summer debunking the equally persistent
belief that crop circles are symbols made by aliens, thanks to the
hit movie "Signs," which explores the phenomenon of geometric circles
made in fields.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no mystery to be explained here. I went out twice with
some wooden boards and made crop circles," said Christopher. "If it
is aliens, they are very low-tech."</TE>
<TE>   Conspiracy theories are a staple of any society, according to
psychologists. Often borne of intense political disaffection and a
deep-seated need for order, such wild theories offer believers neat
explanations for complex events with the assurance their assertions
can't be disproved. After all, how can anyone prove a "hidden hand"
isn't behind the event?</TE>
<TE>   "The Internet makes this sound even more credible," said Terence
Sandbek, a psychologist in private practice in Sacramento who deals
with issues of faith, doubt and belief. "We tend to seek out people
with similar biases, and on the Internet there are so many of them.
So it seems it has to be true."</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, the conspiratorial ideas about the moon landing have
found expression in movies and television as well. In 1978, the movie
"Capricorn One," which had stars Sam Waterston and O.J. Simpson
staging a landing on Mars, fueled cries that the moon landing was a
hoax. Within the last couple of years, Fox television has repeated
broadcasts of its special, "Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the
Moon?"</TE>
<TE>   "We always get calls even from teachers after the Fox program
airs," said Bob Jacobs, a NASA spokesman in Washington, D.C. "It's
ridiculous. We don't want to debate it because it lessens one of the
greatest achievements of human history."</TE>
<TE>   Aldrin's sudden and unexpected confrontation this week
demonstrates a familiar tactic to gain publicity among such
theorists, said Pat Linse, co-founder of the Skeptics Society in
Altadena.</TE>
<TE>   "You see a lot of this among the Holocaust deniers too," said
Linse. "They provoke people into anger and then they crow, 'We were
cool and rational, while the other side was not.'</TE>
<TE>   "This guy is getting a terrific amount of attention and it has
worked beautifully," she added. "His arguments [about the moon
landing] weren't good enough to get attention, but the fact he seemed
to provoke an elderly man did get him attention."</TE>

<LD>Here we are on a Sunday evening, worshiping the Dodgers at the late
service, saying vespers and looking forward to the playoffs, mustard
on our busy lips.</LD>
<LD>   "Go, Dodgers!" a boy in front of us prays.</LD>
<LD>   "Yeah, go, Dodgers!" says his friend.</LD>
<TE>   We've come to this outdoor service to wish these Dodgers well as
they prepare to leave town to pursue a playoff spot. Next stop: San
Francisco, that little settlement by the bay.</TE>
<TE>   "Go, Shawn," yells the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Go, Dodgers!" screams a believer in a blue wig.</TE>
<TE>   The little girl's bony elbow is on my shoulder, nudging my
sunburned neck. Ever notice the way a kid invades your personal
space? It's worst at a ballpark, where they lean on you, elbow you,
wipe their ketchuped hands on your ketchuped knee.</TE>
<TE>   All around us, kids like her bounce in their seats. No one sits
normally. They sit on their ankles. They sit on their knees.</TE>
<TE>   The young fans jump around like squirrels at a wine tasting. The
organ plays, they bounce. Someone fouls off a pitch, they bounce.
Doesn't anybody sit still anymore? No, they bounce.</TE>
<TE>   "Sit still," I tell the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Me?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, you," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, Dad," she says, grabbing at my shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Not much seems to change at Dodger Stadium, other than food prices
and center fielders. Next to me, there's what passes for progress
here: garlic fries, a new offering. Mostly, everything else is the
same.</TE>
<TE>   We look left. We pan right. At some point in every game, every fan
takes a wide, sweeping look at this classic ball yard. You can't be
anything but pleased with the way it's holding up after 40 years.
Middle age never looked better.</TE>
<TE>   I explain to the little girl how the stadium  sits among hills,
nestled into the canyon with its back to the wind.</TE>
<TE>   Evidently, old man O'Malley knew his stuff, sparing his
ballplayers the vagaries of ocean breezes.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   "O'Malley," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "O'who?"</TE>
<TE>   "Never mind," I say.</TE>
<TE>   In the third inning, the beach balls appear, America's last act of
civil disobedience, in numbers too plentiful to count.</TE>
<TE>   Four of them scatter in front of us like a covey of quail. It's as
if they're breeding under the seats.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at all the beach balls," the little girl marvels.</TE>
<TE>   "Just watch the game," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "He popped it," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Where?"</TE>
<TE>   "The usher," she says. "He popped it with a pen."</TE>
<TE>   "Just watch the game," I say again.</TE>
<TE>   "There's another one," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Back on the field, dusk seems to pull a blanket over the Dodgers'
eyes. In the first three innings, they can't manage a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, their opponents, the team from Houston, score early. At
the end of three innings, the Astros lead by two.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the fourth inning, a pitcher's worst nightmare. Line
drive to the face. Dodger pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii raises his hands but
not in time. The ball ricochets off his brow and bounces to the
backstop. A hundred feet, at least.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii collapses as if struck by lightning, which he was. His legs
kick the dirt. Fans cringe and turn away.</TE>
<TE>   The batter stops halfway to first, wondering if he just killed a
man. Players rush to the mound, fearing what they'll find.
Diamondvision goes blank. More than 43,000 fans go quiet. Real
prayers begin.</TE>
<TE>   "Is he going to be OK?" asks the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't know," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh no," she says, burrowing her head into my shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   For 15 minutes, we wait as emergency personnel tend to the wounded
pitcher. The center field fence opens and an ambulance arrives.
Finally. Early word is that he suffered a concussion but will be all
right.</TE>
<TE>   "Lucky man," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, very lucky," says the guy behind me.</TE>
<TE>   And slowly, the game returns to Dodger Stadium. In the bottom of
the fourth, Dave Roberts, master thief, lays down a perfect bunt,
then steals second. A somber crowd gets its voice back. But the
Dodgers surrender without a run.</TE>
<TE>   About 6 p.m., an early autumn chill begins to work its way through
the shadows. L.A. can go from too warm to too cool in about 30
seconds. Not tonight. Tonight, it cools down slowly. Like soup.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the Dodgers' bats at rest, there are things to watch. A
hot dog wrapper floats gently down from the deck above. A vendor
yells, "Nuts! No waiting! Nuts!"</TE>
<TE>   Up the aisle--again--comes one of those L.A. creations, blond and
in need of constant attention. It confirms my theory that women with
the biggest breasts have the smallest bladders.</TE>
<TE>   This one strolls up and down the aisle at least a half dozen
times, disrupting the evening's main event as she heads to the
restroom. Back and forth, back and forth. Doesn't anyone stay still
anymore? No, they bounce.,</TE>
<TE>   It's a distraction, even by L.A. standards. Every time she passes,
fathers stop eating mid-bite. Small boys forget their mothers.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's that?" the little girl asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Eat your ice cream," I say.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, still down by four, the Dodgers begin to mount a
counterattack. The crowd stirs. The beach balls are forgotten. Even
the kids settle in their seats.</TE>
<TE>   "Put on your rally cap," I tell the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Two Dodgers have reached base on hits, and a third is walked,
loading them up. Alex Cora twists an inside pitch down the line for a
double, and suddenly the Dodgers are within two runs.</TE>
<TE>   "These hats are working," the little girl says.</TE>
<TE>   "Think so?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yep."</TE>
<TE>   Just in time for a pennant race. Just in time for fall.</TE>

<HD>If It's Fall, TV Show Billboards Must Be Springing Up All
Over</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The season-premiere billboards are in bloom again. Such a strange
flower. At summer's end every year, they rise from the parched
landscape along the freeways and boulevards, decorate the sides of
buses and bus stops, as brilliant as chrysanthemums and full of equal
promise. This will be a bountiful fall; this winter we shall want for
nothing.</LD>
<LD>   Here are the sitcoms with their eye-rolling mismatched couples,
here are the resolute ensembles of the new courtroom/emergency
room/department of health inspectors drama, here are the extended
families/small towns whose trials, tribulations and oboe-heavy
background music will soon win our hearts.</LD>
<LD>   They beckon us as we drive, reminding us of a parallel universe
full of stouthearted law enforcement officials and smiley,
wisecracking colleagues who really care. We look at these cleareyed,
lip-glossed faces, these miens of sober intent and we want to
believe. That "Good Morning, Miami" is going to go far, that
"Everwood" will be groundbreaking television, the next "Hill Street
Blues," even the next "thirtysomething." They will change the way we
think about television, about each other.</LD>
<TE>   But even as hope flickers, it flickers out. "Good Morning, Miami,"
yeah, right, that's going to be a winner. After so many late summers,
we all know that most of these shows are going to stink out loud and
inevitably we will scan channels in the hopes of finding a rerun of
"MASH" or "Cagney &amp; Lacey." Or abandoning the box altogether.</TE>
<TE>   It's heartbreaking, really. Especially in this town. The faces and
names on those billboards are this year's big winners--the ones who
made it to the final round in the endless competition that fuels so
much of this city. These are the actors and writers and directors who
for years supported themselves through game shows and weekly yard
sales, who sold off their Duran Duran albums and dangly earrings for
beer money and rent so they could stay in town long enough for the
next audition or meeting.</TE>
<TE>   These are the people who foamed our cappuccinos, parked our cars,
walked our dogs, and yet always seemed to get a seat at the hottest
bar in town.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, their faces surround us, when we drive and when we
don't. Airbrushed, ever-hopeful head shots smile down from our dry
cleaners, the deli counter, even the carwash. Sitting at cafe tables,
on the low walls at the beach, men and women lean toward each other,
their voices flying as fast and high as their hands. In other cities
they would be talking politics or finance; here they're arguing about
the feasibility of writing a mid-size movie or a spec script for "The
West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   So many people living in a state of suspended animation--waiting
for green lights and contract renewals, for the next phone call, for
the check to clear. Everything is negotiable, everything is fluid,
everything pinned on what will happen next. It may explain why so
much is attached to the only two symbols of relative stability in
town--the awards shows and the new fall season.</TE>
<TE>   Summer in L.A. inevitably flares one last time as it teeters
officially toward autumn, and there is a moment when things hold
still. Here are the sneak previews of the new movies and here, at
long last, is the new fall lineup. For a moment, something has been
settled--these shows, these people. It could all change in a matter
of weeks, but for now this is it. So here's the photo op, line them
up along the freeways, along the streets like contestants in a beauty
contest.</TE>
<TE>   For a few lovely moments, it's the industry that's standing still
while the rest of us flash by lost in our own dreams.</TE>

<LD>Be Safe When You Play</LD>
<LD>   Anna had just walked onto the frontyard with her ball and was
ready to give it a good kick when her friend Otto the Auto drove up.</LD>
<LD>   "Hi, Anna," Otto called. "It looks like you're ready for a game of
kickball."</LD>
<TE>   "You're just in time, Otto," Anna said. "When the other kids get
here, we're going to play in the frontyard."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be safer if you played in the backyard, or even
went to the park for your game. Sometimes children get very excited
during play, and they might run into the street after the ball. If
that happens, they could be hurt very badly by a car."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Otto, you're right," Anna said. "My mom and dad tell me to be
careful of cars when crossing the street and riding my bicycle. But I
never thought I could be hurt by playing in my frontyard."</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen how well you kick a ball, Anna," Otto said. "During
your game, the ball might fly out of the yard. Remember that drivers
sometimes have a hard time seeing you if you run into the street, and
they might not be able to stop quickly enough."</TE>
<TE>   "Otto, when the other kids get here, we'll go to the big park down
the block," Anna said. "Then you'll really see how far I can kick a
ball."</TE>
<TE>   Otto the Auto is a robotic car that visits classes throughout
Southern California free of charge. Principals can arrange for Otto
to visit schools by contacting the Automobile Club of Southern
California at (714) 885-2317. Visit Otto's Web site at

<LD>. . .We believed we</LD>
<LD>   Would see with our own eyes the new</LD>
<LD>   World where man was no longer</LD>
<TE>   Wolf to man, but men and women</TE>
<TE>   Were all brothers and lovers</TE>
<TE>   Together. We will not see it.</TE>
<TE>   We will not see it, none of us.</TE>
<TE>   It is farther off than we thought.</TE>
<TE>   --Kenneth Rexroth</TE>
<TE>   There are moments in the writer's life when formal eloquence fails
before history, when explanation falls out of reach. Silence,
however, is not a choice. And so, the writer falls back on ancient
duties: the simple act of witness, the preservation of memory, the
expression of solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   One year ago today such a moment exploded in lower Manhattan and
at the Pentagon and in a field in Pennsylvania. Among that day's most
unexpected consequences has been an outpouring of work by West Coast
writers and editors who banded together in various groups to speak
what could be said to the larger, national community about its loss,
its anger and its peril. Like Sept. 11, 2001, this is an
unprecedented event, and three of the works that flowed from it--two
produced in L.A. and one in Portland--commend themselves to
thoughtful attention.</TE>
<TE>   The most unusual is the current issue of Written By, the magazine
of the Writers Guild of America, West. The entire volume is given
over to Sept. 11. The graphic images are striking and shrewdly chosen
(see the accompanying cover illustration), and the only
representation of the World Trade Center is a color satellite photo
of the smoldering site taken on Sept. 12.</TE>
<TE>   More remarkable still is the content, which manages to convey that
the industry, for all its vulgarity and venality, encompasses a
network of serious, thoughtful, accomplished writers.
"Unfortunately," said Richard Stayton, Written By's editor, "popular
ideas about screenwriters are shaped by the coverage in the trades.
It's all box office, the deal and the pitch. Ours is a literary
perspective, which comes through as it may never have before in this
issue. It shows there is a community out there of deeply intellectual
writers, who happen to be making a living writing for Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Stayton recalled that when he first raised the possibility of
dealing with the anniversary at a meeting of his editorial advisory
committee, novelist and screenwriter David Freeman responded by
urging that "it should be the whole issue. David argued that the
writers of the guild had an obligation to make a statement about 9/11
to the nation."</TE>
<TE>   One of the issue's achievements, in fact, is that it
makes--entirely without self-congratulation--a point first noted in
the prestigious British documentary series "Panorama": Hollywood
writers have been more prescient on the nature and origins of
contemporary terrorism than any Western intelligence agency.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in a piece Stayton contributed on the travails
suffered by New Yorker magazine writer Lawrence Wright and producer
Lynda Obst during the making of the film "Siege," the editor quotes a
U.S. military analyst who appeared in "Panorama's" recent Sept. 11
special, "A Warning From Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   "About the only thing they really got wrong was they didn't come
out and name Osama bin Laden," former U.S. intelligence analyst Lt.
Col. Ralph Peters told his British interviewers, "... but the overall
vision was absolutely more acute than any intelligence report I read
when I was in the Pentagon."</TE>
<TE>   Another Los Angeles-based publication that cuts across the grain
of prevailing opinion is "It's a Free Country: Personal Freedom In
America After September 11," the first in a projected series of books
on public issues to be published and edited by civil libertarians
Danny Goldberg, Victor Goldberg and Robert Greenwald.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Goldberg is president of Artemis Records and the ACLU
Foundation of Southern California; his father, Victor, formerly
co-published Tikkun and the Nation; and Greenwald is a veteran
producer and director of films and television.</TE>
<TE>   Their volume's tone, intensely critical of the erosion of civil
liberties that has occurred in Sept. 11's wake, is set by Cornell
West in his introductory essay, "Lift Every Voice." As the Princeton
University professor writes, the book "bears witness to a precious
truth of American life after the ugly catastrophe of Sept. 11, 2001:
The spirit of freedom is still alive in the face of panic-driven
government policies. And since dissent and criticism are the
life-blood of freedom in a democratic society, this book is in the
best of the American grain. It is no accident that the voices in this
volume are those of progressives, liberals and conservatives."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, among the book's notable attributes is the presence of
essays not only by civil libertarians of the left--Ira Glasser,
Howard Zinn, Tom Hayden and Ramona Ripston, among many others--but
also conservative critics of overreaching government, including
former U.S. Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia and Republican activist Paul
Weyrich.</TE>
<TE>   "Books have a disproportionate effect on the life of the nation,"
said Greenwald, "and we thought this was a wonderful moment to launch
our series with something we could be proud of like this."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, from the Portland-based small press Hawthorne Books comes
a remarkable anthology, "September 11: West Coast Writers Approach
Ground Zero." Among its 34 contributors are T. Coraghessan Boyle,
Wanda Coleman, Peter Coyote, Harlan Ellison, Lawrence Ferlinghetti,
Amy Gerstler, the late Ken Kesey, Maxine Hong Kingston, Alejandro
Morales, Ishmael Reed and Alice Walker.</TE>
<TE>   "Right after Sept. 11," said Kate Hengerer, who founded Hawthorne
just a year ago with partner Rhonda Hughes, "we started receiving a
lot of e-mails from writers and avid readers searching blindly for
some response. Rhonda and I looked at each other and knew we should
create something larger and more lasting."</TE>
<TE>   So they invited 85 writers to contribute to the collection and
"received 34 very quick responses. People were very eager to
participate." Hengerer and Hughes also asked poet and playwright Jeff
Meyers, who founded Portland's Vertigo Theater, to edit the
anthology, which he deftly did.</TE>
<TE>   As an adjunct to the collection's publication, contributors will
read from their selections today at cities all along the West Coast.
In Los Angeles, Ellison, Coleman, Floyd Salas and Larry Grobel will
read from their pieces at 7 p.m. in the Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore at
the Grove at West 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Less focused than Written By, less forcefully topical than "It's a
Free Country," Hawthorne's anthology reminds us that, even when
engaged by immediate historical questions, the focus of West Coast
letters traditionally has been more idiosyncratic, more broadly
cultural in its preoccupations. Something of its flavor comes through
in these brief excerpts:</TE>
<TE>   To Boyle, for example, Sept. 11 "was an attack so vicious as to
make us all quail before the imperative that drove it: How could
anyone hate so much?</TE>
<TE>   "Sadly, I think we all now know."</TE>
<TE>   Kesey's reflections, too, came to rest on hate, though from a
different angle. "True, the warriors on our side of this Real War
seem few and flimsy, but we have a secret advantage: We don't fight
our battle out of Hate. Anger, yes, if we have to, but anger is
enough. Hate is the flag the other side battles beneath. It is the
ancient flag of fire and blood and agony, and it waves over the
graves of millions and millions."</TE>
<TE>   Morales, a novelist and UC Irvine professor, begins by evoking the
mariposas (butterflies) and colibries (hummingbirds) of Central Park
and concludes: "Now when I go to New York I go to Ground Zero, a
sacred place, and stare into the emptiness where I wait to feel the
embrace of los miles amados de las torres, of the thousands of loved
ones, the Mariposas and the Colibries of the towers. I wait to hear
their voices, to hear them speak to me like family and remind me that
I am anchored to them for eternity."</TE>
<TE>   The lines with which this column began are not included in any of
the books discussed above. They were written in 1952 on the death of
the poet's old comrade, Eli Jacobson. They are included here because
they represent a great West Coast writer's evocation of a certain
kind of loss also engendered by Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   But on this anniversary we ought also to reach even further back
and to recall the spell against despair invoked by another West Coast
poet, Kenneth Patchen, at the outset of the Second World War:</TE>
<TE>   Therefore the constant powers do not lessen;</TE>
<TE>   Nor is the property of the spirit scattered</TE>
<TE>   On the cold hills of these events.</TE>

<LD>There are thousands of ways Americans are memorializing the events of
last Sept. 11, including a small group of people using their
motorcycles.</LD>
<LD>   In a cross-country trip that left San Diego on Sept. 2,
participants in America's Ride traveled 3,500 miles in nine days,
stopping along the way--in Las Vegas, where two riders got married;
in Lima, Ohio, where 200 local riders joined them to show their
support; in Shanksville, Pa., where they attended a ceremony honoring
victims of United Flight 93.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the motorcyclists will ride to New York City and suburban
Washington, D.C., and attend memorial services at ground zero and the
Pentagon. Among the riders were Vinny Forras, a firefighter who
worked at ground zero; Charles Cook, a ground zero volunteer; and
Mitchell Morrison, chairman of the World Trade Center Miracles
Foundation, which arranged the event to raise money to assist people
injured in the attacks and its aftermath.</LD>
<TE>   A year ago, the chance to ride across America would have been just
another adventure. On this ride, it was also a tribute to those whose
lives were sacrificed and to the resilience of a nation.</TE>
<TE>   Additional photos from America's Ride, including the
motorcyclists' arrival today in New York, will be on The Times' Web
site at www.latimes.com/ride.</TE>

<HD>Trying to Read God's Mind</HD>
<DH>Some who survive disasters credit divine intervention, but
some theologians are wary</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HAMIL R. HARRIS and BILL BROADWAY</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Powerful testimonies have emerged in recent weeks from people who
called on God while standing in the shadow of death.</LD>
<LD>   In La Plata, Md., a father huddled his family on the floor and
recited the Lord's Prayer as a deadly tornado passed their living
room window and destroyed other buildings on the block.</LD>
<LD>   In Kensington, Md., an Amtrak conductor dropped to his knees and
prayed seconds after the Capitol Limited derailed and cars tumbled
into a ravine, injuring the conductor and more than 100 other people.
No one died.</LD>
<TE>   In Somerset, Pa., ministers led families and rescue workers in
prayer for three days until nine coal miners trapped beneath the
earth were saved by efforts some called miraculous.</TE>
<TE>   But what do these testimonies mean? In a crisis situation, do the
chances of survival increase if you ask God to save you? Should
pastors preach or teach that the use of what some call "flare
prayers" is the way to cope with disaster?</TE>
<TE>   Survivors of the Maryland and Pennsylvania incidents believe that
God interceded on their behalf. But some ministers and scholars
disagree, saying it is impossible to know--or manipulate--divine will
and that it's irresponsible for survivors or clergy to promote the
use of flare prayers.</TE>
<TE>   "Church leaders who teach this are setting up false expectations,"
said David Spradlin, an elder of the University Park Church of Christ
in Hyattsville, Md. "What about the [more than 2,800] people who died
in the World Trade Center? Were not some of those people praying?"</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Edward Voorhaar, whose church's youth group probably
survived April's tornado because it had canceled its Sunday night
meeting, called crisis praying a "complicated theological issue."</TE>
<TE>   The twister crushed La Plata United Methodist's empty education
wing, harming no one, but killed a man across the street. Four other
people died that night, and Voorhaar has no doubt every one of them
was praying, "Lord, save me."</TE>
<TE>   "It is impossible to know the will of God," Voorhaar said. "I am
just grateful that more people in this community were not killed or
injured."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Jack Marcom, a retired Army chaplain and pastor of
Friendship Baptist Church in Fredericksburg, Va., isn't against flare
prayers if they are offered by people who believe in God and don't
try to dictate the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who turns to God in times of crisis must have some type
of spiritual roots already," Marcom said. As a military and law
enforcement chaplain, Marcom said, he has offered many prayers.
However, "I always asked God to be present with my soldiers in the
foxhole, not to win the battle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Yates, a professor at the Capital Bible Seminary in
Lanham, Md., said ministers shouldn't preach that God saves
individuals simply because they ask him to spare their lives. It
gives false hope and tells people what they want to hear, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People are basically materialistic and want God to make them
happy," Yates said. "We can't think that God is a puppet. When we go
through pain, maybe he wants us to repent and get right with him."</TE>
<TE>   Yates advises people in crisis to pray that God have mercy on them
and that God's will be done, good or bad. Yates said he learned this
lesson in 1990 when his son died after an automobile accident in
Washington state caused by a drunk driver.</TE>
<TE>   "I wondered why God didn't answer the prayers for my son," he
said. "But then I reflected on Romans 8:28: 'And we know that all
things work together for good to them that love God.' "</TE>
<TE>   Flare prayer proponents also can be found in the Pennsylvania
mining town that was the scene of this summer's near-tragedy. The
Rev. Charles Olson, pastor of Grace United Methodist Church in
Somerset, said he's sure that God spared the life of church member
Mark Popernack, the last miner hoisted out in the early hours of July
28.</TE>
<TE>   Olson prayed with Sandy Popernack, the miner's wife, throughout
the 77-hour ordeal while Mark Popernack was praying from Black Wolf
mine 240 feet below the surface.</TE>
<TE>   "We offered a lot of prayers down there," Popernack said, adding
that the episode strengthened his faith and religious commitment. "I
was going to church, but now I plan to go more often."</TE>
<TE>   The third calamity, the July 29 derailment of an Amtrak train in
Kensington, produced other believers.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak officials have prohibited employees from talking about the
accident while it's under investigation. But a few hours after a
heat-buckled track created what could have been a disaster, assistant
conductor Stephen Smart spoke about how prayer saved his life.</TE>
<TE>   "Prayer works," Smart said as he walked out of the emergency room
of Holy Cross Hospital with a broken elbow. "I knew [the derailment]
was serious. As soon as it happened, I got down on my knees and said,
'Oh, God, not today!' "</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--Back in the same place, the same hotel, covering the same
event, not on purpose but maybe not accidentally, either, I find
myself drawn every day to a display in Grand Central Station.</LD>
<LD>   It is not fancy, a haphazard posting of photos and letters,
signatures and poems, messages left about and for victims of the
Sept. 11 tragedy and their survivors.</LD>
<LD>   Before I'd get on the bus to the U.S. Open tennis tournament, I'd
walk to Grand Central to buy newspapers and to stare at the board.
I'd look at the faces, the photos of people who were no more or less
special than I, and I would read the note or see the obituary and I
would cry a little.</LD>
<TE>   Grand Central is next to the hotel I was staying in a year ago on
the day two planes crashed into the two World Trade Center towers.
For a moment the day before I had owned a seat on American Flight 11,
the Boston-to-Los Angeles flight that became the first terrorist
missile to hit the first tower.</TE>
<TE>   I had lucked into a business-class upgrade to a seat four rows
behind where Mohamed Atta would sit, but for reasons so trite as not
wanting to get up so early to catch a connector to Boston, I changed
my flight. Maybe it was luck or fate or divine intervention, but when
Flight 11 crashed into the tower, I was asleep in a hotel room.</TE>
<TE>   "God must have wanted you to live for some reason," well-meaning
friends and intrigued strangers said. And I would think: "But,
surely, God did not want the others to die?"</TE>
<TE>   Or, "You must be destined for something special." And I think:
"But what if I'm not? What if my life is the same as millions of
others, of working, of enjoying friends and family, of some good,
some bad, of nothing distinguished but nothing to be embarrassed
about?"</TE>
<TE>   Or, "You must have done something very good in your life." I would
shake my head and think: "But that would mean the other passengers
hadn't. And, of course, that's not true."</TE>
<TE>   My reason for being in New York on Sept. 11, 2001 was a favorite
assignment, writing about the U.S. Open tennis tournament. And now
I'm back, having covered the same tournament. I wanted to be here.
For the tennis, which was great theater this year, fated, maybe, to
have four Americans in the finals; but also for the chance to look
into the hole that was once the World Trade Center, to retrace steps,
to be part of this again.</TE>
<TE>   I do feel attached to Sept. 11 and for that I feel guilty. I
didn't get on the plane, after all, and so my life did not
dramatically change. I lost no loved ones, I suffered no injuries.
After six days, I got on another plane and came home.</TE>
<TE>   Because I'd written about my experiences in New York for this
paper, I'd receive wonderful e-mails from readers who wanted to know:
Did I feel lucky? Or sad? Or frightened? Was I different somehow?</TE>
<TE>   And I'd think about the questions. But only for a minute.</TE>
<TE>   I would read--every word--the small portraits of each victim in
the New York Times. I used to read the Sports section first. Now it
was those little stories and every day I would cry over them until my
husband thought maybe it would be best if I didn't read them. But I
couldn't stop. So that was different.</TE>
<TE>   Every time I see an American flag or hear a patriotic song, those
tears come again. When I began reporting baseball games again, I
considered myself lucky to be in California where it's always OK to
wear sunglasses. I didn't want to be seen weeping every day in a
press box when they play the national anthem. So that was different.</TE>
<TE>   Because I was there during the attacks, I was assigned to report
the story from Bellevue, the hospital where families had been sent to
fill out missing-persons reports. Today, a year later, the faces and
voices of those men and women, mothers and fathers, boyfriends and
girlfriends, husbands and wives, are alive in my head. I would
recognize them all in a minute. I felt intrusive a year ago, asking
them whose pictures they were holding up to news cameras. I still
feel intrusive, that I remember their names and faces and stories.</TE>
<TE>   I can't imagine how this year has gone for them. And then I wonder
how the year would have gone for my family if I'd gotten on Flight
11. So that's different.</TE>
<TE>   Monday I went to ground zero for the first time. The hole is so
big, bigger than I imagined. Deeper than I dreamed. It is a grave
site. It would have been my grave site. I did think that. So that's
different.</TE>
<TE>   One day during the Open, I was the only passenger in a van
returning to my hotel from the tournament in Queens. The driver, a
60-ish Irishman, asked what I thought about Sept. 11. He wondered if
I had been here last year too. I told him my story.</TE>
<TE>   He told me where he'd been at the moment the towers fell, at his
job, waiting for a call and not believing what he had seen. We talked
about New York and New Yorkers, how the city was recovering. But he
kept asking me, "Has your life changed? Are you different?" He wanted
an answer.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't have one.</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving New York, I walked to Grand Central Station to look
again at the board with the photos and it was gone. Standing in the
hallway, where the board had been, I started to cry.</TE>
<TE>   A New York police officer asked what was wrong and I felt foolish
when I told him. He pointed to the main hall of the terminal and said
the board had only been moved to a more prominent location. "We want
more people to see so that more people won't forget," the officer
said.</TE>
<TE>   And there's my answer. I wish I could find the van driver again.</TE>
<TE>   I will never forget. I had a seat four rows behind Mohamed Atta. I
don't know why I didn't keep the seat, and, of course, I'm lucky and
blessed I didn't.</TE>
<TE>   But in a strange way, having that seat, even for a minute, has
also been a bit of a blessing. Because I was connected to the
tragedies, and then saved, and I'll never know why.</TE>
<TE>   But I'll never not be there with those who weren't as fortunate.
Wherever I go, they will be with me.</TE>
<TE>   I have no choice. We all should have no choice.</TE>

<HD>Women's Book on Home Repairs: Call It an Empowerment Tool</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNIE GROER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Julie Sussman began her home repair odyssey by climbing onto a roof
and caulking a leak. Stephanie Glakas-Tenet dismantled a lawn mower
to unclog the gas line.</LD>
<LD>   Now the duo, CIA wives with matching tool belts, hope to convince
women that hammers, wrenches, screwdrivers and even pizza cutters are
implements of empowerment. And economy.</LD>
<LD>   "Dare to Repair: A Do-It-Herself Guide to Fixing (Almost) Anything
in the Home" (Harper Resource) is clearly written for novices. It
covers plumbing, electricity, appliances and home safety plus
windows, walls and doors. There's a resource list and help on finding
contractors.</LD>
<TE>   The authors spent nearly a decade on the book while raising kids
and running households in suburban Washington. "My husband was never
home, and I couldn't afford a contractor," said Sussman, 42, mother
of two and wife of career CIA employee Jerry Sussman. "When he was
away, I was wasting precious phone calls with him on repair
things--the toilet, the garbage disposal."</TE>
<TE>   Glakas-Tenet, 46, who has one son, learned from her father how to
fix lots of stuff. "One day, my husband came home to see me
straddling the chimney on the roof," she said of CIA Director George
Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   The two met at a barbecue, and Sussman soon suggested they do a
book demystifying home repair. They queried 500 women of all ages,
races and fix-it know-how beforehand. Always the test was, "Could my
69-year-old mom do these repairs?" said Sussman.</TE>
<TE>   What they did not want was a stylish, pricey coffee-table tome
featuring "a Barbie with a blond ponytail doing wallpaper." They
lobbied hard for an affordable paperback with Rosie the Riveter on
the cover. Simple drawings illustrate tools and materials, often in
the hands of old, young and multicultural women, some pregnant or in
a wheelchair. The authors did every repair themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Glakas-Tenet remembers a frantic call from Ann Mueller, wife of
FBI Director Robert Mueller, about a flooded sink from a clogged
garbage disposal. "I talked her through it. I told her to get a
flashlight. We were both on our knees under our sinks. She fixed it
in three minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Not all their tools are conventional. A rubber jar lid opener
doubles as a gripper and metal protector when using a wrench.</TE>
<TE>   And that pizza slicer? It works wonders on windows jammed or
painted shut.</TE>

<LD>Six o'clock was almost earlier than Kaci had ever been up, except
when she went to Girl Scout Camp. (And I didn't like it even then,
Kaci thought.) The sun had barely risen over the horizon, and Mrs.
Collins was already in her backyard taking care of her Labrador
puppy. "I'm running late, Kaci. My plane leaves in a little over
three hours. Remember, this is what you should do. Every morning,
give Nya a scoop of food and clean water. Then do it again in the
afternoon. And be careful. If she ever runs away from you, you'd
better be packing a lunch, because you'll never be able to get her
back home."</LD>
<LD>   Kaci said, "Sure, Mrs. Collins." (Inside she was thinking--this is
the easiest $25 I'll ever make.)</LD>
<LD>   "OK," Mrs. Collins said. "I left my number with your mother, in
case you have problems. Good luck."</LD>
<TE>   "Thanks. See you," said Kaci as Mrs. Collins drove away. Nya
started jumping on Kaci and chewing on her bathrobe. (This has got to
stop--this is my favorite bathrobe, Kaci thought.) The girl looked
throughout Mrs. Collins' backyard for a leash and then realized that
she had a long piece of rope in her own backyard next door. She
closed the gate behind her. But when she returned to Mrs. Collins'
yard, Nya was nowhere to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "Nya! Nya!" Kaci yelled for the dog behind trees, over the fence
and by the side of the house. She even jiggled nuggets in the dog
food bag because that's what always brought her cat running. (Kaci
thought: I've lost this dog and I've only been dog-sitting for five
minutes. I'm going to be late to school. And my mom will never let me
have a dog of my own.)</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: What will Kaci do?</TE>
<TE>   Dolores Johnson especially likes writing stories that recall the
adventures and misadventures of real little girls and boys. This
story will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.comkids.</TE>

<LD>Caponata is a flavorful, sweet-sour Sicilian cooked salad composed of
eggplant, onions, tomatoes, garlic, herbs, olive oil and vinegar.
It's subject to as many variations as there are cooks who prepare it.
Typically served as an antipasto, salad side dish or condiment
relish, caponata is often made with olives, anchovies and capers,
depending on the menu.</LD>
<LD>   This version by my assistant Heather Behm--which includes zucchini
and pine nuts--works well with simple roasted or grilled meats. It's
perfect as an omelet filling. Add anchovies, fresh basil and Parmesan
for a pasta topping. Try it with olives and fresh basil in lasagna or
as a simple casserole, sprinkled with mozzarella cheese, baked until
browned and sizzling hot. Turn it into a dip, coarsely chopped in the
food processor, served chilled with tortilla chips. With the addition
of capers, it also makes a tasty garnish for grilled fish, poultry
and veal.</LD>

<LD>A salad like this could be a lot heavier, but I've kept it light by
using a small amount of oil in the dressing and noodles that aren't
deep-fried. The crisp lettuce and fresh vegetables add texture, while
cooked shrimp makes this a substantial salad indeed.</LD>
<LD>   If you prefer, you can substitute lobster or crab meat. For even
more flavor, punch up the wasabi--make the dressing as hot and spicy
as you'd like.</LD>
<LD>   Yakisoba noodles, usually sold in refrigerated packets of three,
can be found at well-stocked supermarkets and at Asian markets.
Wasabi and mirin also can be found in these stores.</LD>

<HD>But the Chef Is Still Here, Starting Over, Not Able to
Forget</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>People keep expecting Michael Lomonaco to have been totally
transformed by his experience, by his survival, much like the Jimmy
Stewart character in "It's a Wonderful Life," who is saved by
Clarence the angel.</LD>
<LD>   Lomonaco wasn't saved by a guardian angel, but by luck: A year ago
this morning, he finally had enough of an annoying scratch on his
reading glasses and decided to stop at the Lenscrafters store in the
shopping area below the World Trade Center. He was still there at
8:46 a.m., getting fitted for a new pair, then planning to head up to
the 106th floor of the north tower, where he had a prized corner
office as executive chef of Windows on the World. Had the hijacked
jetliner struck five minutes later, he figures, he would have been in
the elevator, traveling up to certain death.</LD>
<LD>   How many times has he told that tale in the last year?</LD>
<TE>   "I haven't wanted to be at the center of things," he says, "but
with my story of my lucky little right turn ... "</TE>
<TE>   He's had to tell it a lot, in other words.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the 47-year-old Lomonaco finally took his first
vacation since that day, going with his wife, Diane, to Belgium and
Amsterdam, taking in the art museums and leaving behind his cell
phone. And his story. "No one knew who we were and we didn't tell
anyone," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But he was back in town Monday, and that night Connie Chung showed
an interview with him on her CNN show. In it, she asked whether his
narrow escape had made him a new person, immune to the trivial
hassles of life.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Brooklyn-born Lomonaco was an actor before he became a
chef, he did not act out the answer that the audience might have
wanted to hear--that like Stewart's George Bailey, he now could
relish even the once annoying moments, like getting stuck in the rain
in a cab.</TE>
<TE>   What he said was, "I wish I could be that changed."</TE>
<TE>   "No, I'm not changed in the sense that the small annoyances of
life no longer bother me," Lomonaco elaborated Tuesday. "I'm still
going to get impatient waiting for the subway."</TE>
<TE>   But he is changed, of course, by being a survivor, one of those
who were below where the plane struck and thus able to escape before
the building disintegrated. Those above, or in the elevators, were
not so fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   Windows, which prided itself on being the highest-grossing
restaurant in the country, taking in $37.5 million its last year, had
450 employees. Of those, 72 were on site that morning, though the
toll there was higher.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you the math," he says. "It's 72 plus one security
guard plus six carpenters who were building a wine room. So that's
79."</TE>
<TE>   In the first days and weeks, a lot of his time was taken up by
meetings with families of the victims, and with memorial services.
"Dozens." He also helped organize the Oct. 1 restaurant industry
service at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine that drew 2,000
people--not only celebrity chefs like himself, but waiters and
dishwashers as well. Both New York senators spoke, as did Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani. Lomonaco read a poem.</TE>
<TE>   He and the restaurant's president, David Emil, helped create the
Windows of Hope charity to raise funds for the families of their dead
colleagues and other food service workers. The organization has
raised $19 million and is assisting 125 families, including more than
150 children.</TE>
<TE>   Solace at the Stove</TE>
<TE>   It was not until Thanksgiving, Lomonaco says, that he began to
find some normality in his life--by cooking. He'd do it at first just
for himself and his wife. By Christmas, all he wanted to do was bake.</TE>
<TE>   Last June, he helped Emil open a new Latin-themed restaurant,
Noche, at the north end of Times Square. Though about 60 of the 100
employees used to work at Windows, several Windows survivors picketed
the opening, complaining that wasn't enough. Labor disputes were
another of those mundane hassles that did not go away.</TE>
<TE>   Lomonaco is the consulting chef for the five-story restaurant,
which was going to be a David Copperfield "Magic Underground" until
the theme-restaurant craze bottomed out. The Windows people had
agreed to take over the location before Sept. 11, and give it a Latin
theme inspired by the successful dance and music nights at Windows'
bar.</TE>
<TE>   But Noche will be closed today, so employees can attend the new
round of memorials.</TE>
<TE>   Lomonaco will be at ground zero. He's one of those invited to read
names of the dead. Each speaker has been given 10 names. The person
reading with him drew the name of a Windows victim, Howard Kane, the
controller who had an office next to Lomonaco's. They used to have
coffee every morning and shoot the breeze, talking about Kane's son,
life--and a little business. Kane's window faced north, the direction
from which the plane came.</TE>
<TE>   "Howard saw this happen," Lomonaco says.</TE>
<TE>   How can he forget his old routine? He'd go first to the kitchen
and greet staffers like Heather Ho, the 32-year-old pastry chef from
a family of Honolulu financiers whom they'd recently lured to New
York from San Francisco. He might see their purchasing guy, Charlie
Mauro, to talk about farms or to ask, "Did the fish come?" He'd go to
the employees' cafeteria, where they had promoted a longtime
dishwasher, Gilbert Ruiz, to run the room. A tough old New Yorker, he
seemed happy for the first time, having his little piece of
responsibility. "Man, was he proud," Lomonaco recalls. "I'd come in
and he'd say, 'Chef, coffee's ready. Want a cup?'</TE>
<TE>   "I miss them all."</TE>
<TE>   Lomonaco began his culinary training relatively late in life, at
27, and got his first on-the-line experience at a churn-it-out
Italian place in Brooklyn. Before long, he was working at glamorous
restaurants like Le Cirque, then 21, rising to executive chef of that
famous restaurant before joining Windows in 1997. Along the way, he
began making regular appearances on David Letterman's show and got
his own shows on the Food Network ("Michael's Place") and the Travel
Channel ("Epicurious").</TE>
<TE>   A Place of His Own</TE>
<TE>   But one thing he's never done is owned his own restaurant. And
that's one way the past year has changed him: It's time, he decided.
He's not saying when it might open, or where, but he wants it to have
about 250 seats, far less than the 2,000 capacity in the three
restaurants and banquet rooms of the Windows complex. And he knows
what it must be called. Lomonaco's.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the greatest change," he says. "I woke up and realized
that to have my own restaurant would be the one way to truly express
who I am. Others tell me, 'Don't put your name on it because people
will expect you to be there.' But I want people to be able to come
and find me."</TE>
<TE>   He wants to get as personal as possible, he says, with the city he
never thought of leaving.</TE>
<TE>   He has not avoided ground zero, either, going back on the
anniversaries: one month, three months, six, and now a year.</TE>
<TE>   When he received his list of 10 names to read at the ceremony
today, he was hoping one of his old Windows friends might be on it.</TE>
<TE>   But he did not push the matter or ask to switch with the person
who drew Howard Kane's name. "I would have liked to have drawn it,"
Lomonaco said, "but I never question the luck of the draw."</TE>

<KH>Farmers Markets</KH>
<HD>Coachella Valley Mangoes (Really)</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KARP</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You never know what surprises you'll find at a farmers market. On
Wednesdays in Santa Monica, the fruit of the moment is the mango.</LD>
<LD>   "Wow! ... Are these really grown in California?" shoppers ask
Bertha Wong as they crowd around her gorgeous Keitt mangoes.</LD>
<LD>   Most people think of mangoes as growing in tropical lands such as
India and Thailand, but given enough water, mango trees flourish in
the dry, scorching Coachella Valley. This is the first season that
Wong has had enough of a crop from her 100 trees in North Shore, near
the Salton Sea, to sell at markets.</LD>
<TE>   Compared with specimens from southern Florida, the only other
place where mangoes are grown in the continental United States,
California's fruits are a bit less juicy, but even more intense in
flavor.</TE>
<TE>   They're far better than fruits imported from Latin America and the
Caribbean, which account for more than 98% of American consumption.
Imported fruits often are picked underripe and have to be steamed to
kill insect pests; this treatment adversely affects texture and
flavor.</TE>
<TE>   No mangoes could be more lusciously sweet than those of Wong
Farms. Most are of the Keitt variety, which was first planted in
Florida in 1939, but does especially well under arid conditions. The
fruits are oval and quite large--up to 2 pounds each--with firm,
juicy, lemon-yellow flesh that is delightfully free of fiber. Even
when fully ripe, many Keitts have green skin, while others are
blushed with yellow.</TE>
<TE>   Mangoes are ripe when they give slightly to gentle pressure at the
bottom (narrow) end. A classic preparation is to place the fruit
stem-end down and slice off the two "filets" on either side of the
flat pit in the center. Then crosshatch the two pieces, turn them
inside-out and enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   Near Wong Farms, on the west side of the Salton Sea, are two
commercial plantings of Keitts totaling 175 acres. These fruits
should be available at Southland Costco stores in a day or two.</TE>
<TE>   Another new crop of a desert fruit, dates, has started showing up
at farmers markets. Fresh yellow Barhi dates, which are crunchy and
have a smack of astringency, are available for just a few weeks. They
can be eaten hard or left in a warm area to ripen, at which point
they're incomparably soft and creamy--eating one is like biting into
a sugary cloud.</TE>
<TE>   At the Santa Monica Wednesday market, Robert Lower of Thermal sets
up a spectacular display of unusual fresh dates, including the maroon
Hayani and the pinkish Amir Haj. Aside from Barhi, most are too
astringent to enjoy at this firm stage (known as khalal by
aficionados), but ripen after being frozen for a day or two and then
refrigerated.</TE>
<TE>   Wong Farms will sell mangoes for several weeks at the Wednesday
Santa Monica market as well as the two Saturday markets (Organic, and
Pico and Cloverfield). Wong Farms will also be at the Friday Whittier
market.</TE>
<TE>   Bautista Family Organic Date Ranch of Mecca sells fabulously soft
Barhi, Medjool and Khadrawy dates at many local farmers markets,
including Santa Monica on Wednesday, Saturday (Pico &amp; Cloverfield)
and Sunday; Hollywood on Sunday; Torrance on Tuesday and Saturday;
South Pasadena on Thursday; Pacific Palisades on Sunday; and Redondo
Beach on Thursday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the best things about the classic BLT sandwich is its crunch.
Here's a version that delivers even more, thanks to an old-fashioned
favorite: fried green tomatoes.</LD>
<LD>   The tomatoes are coated with yellow cornmeal, then fried--a
process that doesn't take long. Crisp iceberg lettuce, high-quality
smoked bacon and a thin slice of red onion are the rest of the
fillings for this toasted sandwich.</LD>
<LD>   Still want more crunch?</LD>
<TE>   Open a bag of chips. Then serve cold beer alongside to wash down
these BLFGT's.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't have any green tomatoes in your garden, look for them
at farmers markets or Latino markets, or ask your market's produce
department to order some for you.</TE>

<TE>   Fry the bacon in a heavy 12-inch skillet over medium heat until

world-class and the setting distinctly local</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUELLTON</DL>
<LD>Ever envy those wine old-timers who sit around bragging about the old
days? Visiting Robert Mondavi in the Napa Valley in the 1970s,
chatting with the Sterlings in Sonoma in the 1980s, dropping in on
wacky Jim Clendenen, Adam Tolmach and Bob Lindquist in Santa Maria in
the 1990s. Oh boy, they'll tell you, that was really something. Too
bad you missed it.</LD>
<LD>   But don't worry. The California wine industry is constantly
reinventing itself and there's always another pioneering wine region
to visit. Lucky for us, one of the hottest new areas is in our own
backyard.</LD>
<LD>   Just north of Santa Barbara, vineyards on either flank of the
Santa Rita Hills are turning out wines that are earning rave reviews.
The Wine Spectator's Jim Laube recently chose Sanford Winery's 2000
Pinot Noir from "La Rinconada" as the best California Pinot of that
year--and it was made from only the vineyard's second vintage.</LD>
<TE>   In critic Robert M. Parker Jr.'s recent review of California's
south central coast, wines from the Santa Rita Hills came in for
particularly high praise--especially the cult winery Brewer-Clifton,
whose Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays were variously compared to some of
the greatest wines of Burgundy: Chevalier-Montrachet, Pommard and
even La Tache.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, the area is so close it is an easy day trip. Head up
in the morning, visit a couple of wineries, have a picnic lunch,
visit a couple more, stop for an early dinner and you can be home in
time for Leno.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Rita Hills appellation lies between Buellton in the east
and Lompoc in the west. It is approximately 15 miles long and at
present, there are only four wineries that offer tasting rooms. But
it is expanding quickly. There were only 500 acres of vineyards in
1998; today there are more than 700, and there are hundreds more due
to come on line in the next couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   By then, of course, everybody will have been there. Now is the
time to grab the bragging rights.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, almost all of the Santa Rita Hills appellation is
part of the larger Santa Ynez Valley. Grapes are nothing new in these
parts; the modern wine industry started here in the 1970s. But until
now, most of the activity has centered on the eastern part of the
valley, between Lake Cachuma and Solvang.</TE>
<TE>   The areas are as different as night and day--or, more
appropriately, hot and cold. Temperatures in the new Santa Rita area
are typically 10 to 15 degrees cooler than in the eastern part of the
valley. The eastern part is doing well with Rhone varietals such as
Syrah, as well as Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Around
Santa Rita, the grapes are predominantly Burgundian--Chardonnay and
Pinot Noir.</TE>
<TE>   That's due to a trick of geography. In California, because of the
way the tectonic plates jam together, most mountain ranges run from
north to south. This walls off the interior of the state from the
cooling influences of the ocean. It's why Merced bakes while
Monterey, which is just on the other side of the mountains, chills.</TE>
<TE>   There are breaks in that solid wall, though not many. One of the
biggest lies near Lompoc. Here, there is an east-west valley (or
"transverse maritime throat" in geo-speak) that funnels cold air from
the Pacific inland. Where the valley is narrow (between Lompoc and
Buellton) folks are wearing sweatshirts while people just a couple of
miles away in Santa Ynez, where the valley widens out and the cool
dissipates, are stripping down to T-shirts and shorts.</TE>
<TE>   Smack in the middle of this breezy valley, between the Purisima
and the Santa Rosa hills, lies the Santa Rita Hills, a warren of
nooks and crannies perfect for winegrowers seeking varied vineyard
exposures.</TE>
<TE>   A few hardy pioneers braved the chill and staked out vineyards
here years ago--Richard Sanford's Sanford &amp; Benedict Vineyard,
planted in 1971, was one of the first trophy vineyards in all of
central California.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that, the western end of the valley has never been as
popular for wineries. For one, there is a nearly constant chilly
wind. Trees tend to grow at an eastward slant and the coastal fog
hangs in until noon even in September.</TE>
<TE>   But while it may be inhospitable to sun worshipers, these cool
temperatures allow grapes to hang on the vine for a long time before
they come to full ripeness, gathering more flavor with every day.</TE>
<TE>   Wines from this area tend to have intense, deep fruit flavors
(what wine mavens call "extracted"). They also tend to be somewhat
more alcoholic than normal. It is not uncommon to find Chardonnays
with 15% alcohol. What is uncommon is that however high the alcohol
might be, so concentrated are the fruit flavors that it rarely shows.</TE>
<TE>   New wine regions have a frontier feel to them that is missing from
more established appellations. While the Napa Valley now seems to be
jammed cheek-by-jowl with vineyards, fine restaurants and expensive
stores, in the Santa Rita area the "wine country lifestyle" has not
yet won over. The area still has a farm-town charm. Vineyards are
next door to fields of lima beans. There's not much shopping to
distract you and while there are two very good restaurants in the
area, they are both chophouses.</TE>
<TE>   As Greg Brewer, one of the owners of Brewer-Clifton and the
winemaker at Melville Vineyards &amp; Winery, says: "This place has a
nice, neighborly feeling."</TE>
<TE>   To explore the area, it's probably best to start at the Buellton
end on Santa Rosa Road, since it's pretty even when blanketed by
morning fog. This is a twisting road through golden hills that offers
surprising vistas at almost every turn. It feels a bit like a vinous
Shangri-La. Turn a corner and there will be a field of ornamental
flowers, so intensely colored they almost burn your eyes.
Particularly early in the morning and toward sundown, keep an eye out
for deer, which are everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Stop along the way for a picnic lunch, either at one of the
wineries or at the historic La Purisima Mission, which is just
outside of Lompoc. Then, after the fog burns off, double back toward
Buellton on Highway 246. Get some dinner and then head home.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford Winery Tasting Room. Richard Sanford has been making good
wine in Santa Ynez longer than anyone. He began with Sanford &amp;
Benedict Vineyard farther west, then came to this location, called
Rancho el Jabali, in 1982. The winemaking facilities have moved to a
spectacular new building closer to the original vineyard, but the
tasting room is located here, nestled in a beautiful, out-of-the-way
site planted with native landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford is best known for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, with the best
wines coming from Sanford &amp; Benedict and La Rinconada vineyards. The
wines have been made since 1983 by the talented Bruno d'Alfonso, and
they tend to be a little leaner and perhaps a tad more elegant than
most from around here. They are also among the few vineyards to be
certified organic.</TE>
<TE>   7250 Santa Rosa Road. (805) 688-3300.</TE>
<TE>   Lafond Winery and Vineyards. Pierre Lafond, owner of a prominent
Santa Barbara gourmet deli, planted his vineyard at about the same
time as Sanford. For years the grapes from these vineyards went into
wines bottled under the Santa Barbara Winery label and were probably
better known for their downtown Santa Barbara winery location than
their quality. Beginning in 2000, Lafond began a more upscale line,
making them here at a new winery and selling them under his own name.
Of particular note is the Syrah.</TE>
<TE>   6855 Santa Rosa Road. (805) 688-7921.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford La Rinconada Winery. No matter how many wineries you've
seen, make a point to stop by this one. It is gorgeous. Designed
largely by Sanford himself, incorporating his loves of technical
gadgetry and Taoist philosophy, it features plenty of tricks for wine
geeks (tanks that raise and lower on elevators to allow complete
gravity-driven flow) and design freaks (check out the Virgin of
Guadalupe over the central plaza and the Thai Buddha directly
opposite it). The winery is open for touring only by appointment and
only on Saturdays.</TE>
<TE>   5010 Santa Rosa Road. (805) 688-3300.</TE>
<TE>   La Purisima Mission. Tucked away in one of the folds of the
Purisima Hills, the mission offers a great taste of California
history, as well as being a terrific place for a picnic. Founded in
1787, it has been sensitively restored, and includes a working
kitchen, farm animals and vegetable garden.</TE>
<TE>   2295 Purisima Road. (805) 733-3713</TE>
<TE>   Babcock Winery &amp; Vineyards. Bryan Babcock is the wizard of the
Santa Ynez Valley, spinning off so many wines of such high quality
that it is sometimes difficult to keep them straight. While his
Fathom, Troc and Cuvee Lestat labels pull grapes from the eastern
valley as well as the Santa Maria Valley and points even farther
afield, many of the Babcock wines come from estate vineyards, which
were begun in 1980. Pinot Noirs are particularly good, especially
from the Casa Cassara and Mount Carmel vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   5146 East Highway 246. (805) 736-1455.</TE>
<TE>   Melville Vineyards &amp; Winery. While the bottlings from
Brewer-Clifton are getting most of the buzz (and are almost
impossible to find, even at relatively steep prices), you can sample
some of Greg Brewer's winemaking style more affordably at this
winery. It is run by the very hands-on family of financier Ron
Melville. All of the wines are made from estate grapes and are very
good, but be sure to ask about the "Inox" Chardonnay. Made completely
in stainless steel without a whiff of oak, it is a knockout.</TE>
<TE>   5185 East Highway 246. (805) 735-7030.</TE>
<TE>   Solvang Farmer. He's certainly not the only farmer in the area to
grow vegetables, but because of the farm stand he's run just outside
of Solvang since 1985, Arne Jacobsen is the Solvang Farmer. Although
he's well-known for his corn and melons, the real draw in the fall is
his pumpkin festival.</TE>
<TE>   On Highway 246 about 2 miles west of Solvang.</TE>
<TE>   The Hitching Post. One of the Central Coast's legendary
restaurants, the Hitching Post in Buellton has been grilling steaks
and pouring the best of the local wines since 1986 (the sister
restaurant near Santa Maria has been operating since the '40s). Owner
Frank Ostini even makes his own wine, under the house label and as
Hartley-Ostini. This is an old-fashioned place: Steaks are large and
well-cooked and come with soup or shrimp cocktail, salad and your
choice of potato.</TE>
<TE>   406 East Highway 246, Buellton. (805) 688-0676. Dinner only.</TE>
<TE>   Brothers Restaurant at Mattei's Tavern. For several years in the
'90s, brothers Matt and Jeff Nichols, who had worked at restaurants
such as Spago and Ocean Avenue Seafood, ran a very nice restaurant in
a small house in Solvang. Then they just seemed to disappear for more
than a year. This summer they reappeared at the helm of this
turn-of-the-century stage stop and it's a beaut. The setting is
elegant (well, for Los Olivos) and the cooking takes chophouse fare
to another level. Be sure to try the pure-flavored corn soup,
credited to the Solvang Farmer, and the veal chop with
mustard-flavored potato puree and porcini essence. The wine list
offers a very well-chosen selection of all-star wines from both the
eastern and western Santa Ynez Valley.</TE>
<TE>   2350 Railway Ave., Los Olivos, (805) 688-4820. Dinner only.</TE>

<LD>Getting a wine region declared an official American Viticultural Area
by the federal government is always an ordeal, requiring studies of
an appellation's history, climate, soil, geography and viticulture, a
formal application and a series of public hearings. It takes years.
But for the winemakers of the Santa Rita Hills, that was the easy
part. Coming up with a name has been even tougher.</LD>
<LD>   Their application, first put forward in 1997, was officially
approved last year. That's when the Chileans got involved. It seems
there is already a wine company in Chile called Vina Santa Rita,
which makes a wide range of mostly moderately priced wines and
exports them around the world. It filed suit arguing that the
establishment of a wine region called Santa Rita Hills would confuse
wine buyers who were looking for their product.</LD>
<LD>   As lawsuits go, this one was almost friendly. Some of the Santa
Rita Hills winemakers visited Chile, a contingent from Vina Santa
Rita came to Santa Barbara for a barbecue. Negotiations ensued and in
the end, it was decided that the Californians could go with an
abbreviated form of the name, Sta. Rita Hills, on their labels.</LD>
<TE>   Still, that didn't make everybody happy. As part of the agreement,
the locals had to sign a pledge that they would do their best to keep
the Chileans advised of any Californians who violated the rules.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Babcock, winemaker at Babcock Winery and Vineyards and one
of those who wrote the original application, says he won't sign it.
As a result, his wines that qualify won't be able to carry the name
and will remain labeled simply "Santa Ynez Valley."</TE>

<HD>Windows on the Other Side of the World</HD>
<DH>Above Singapore, a bright reminder</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SINGAPORE</DL>
<LD>Half a world away from New York City, on top of one of Asia's tallest
buildings, a small piece of the World Trade Center lives on.</LD>
<LD>   A restaurant complex called Equinox, designed with help from the
same team that created Windows on the World in New York, opened here
six weeks after the terrorist attack that destroyed the World Trade
Center a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Equinox, a 70-story elevator ride up, with two restaurants, two
bars and four private dining rooms, commands stunning views of
Singapore and glimpses of neighboring Malaysia and Indonesia. It is
surrounded by the floor-to-ceiling windows that defined the New York
restaurant; and like Windows, it is a destination for city dwellers
and tourists alike, a place to take in a sweep of twinkling skyline
and urban harbor.</LD>
<TE>   The designers didn't set out to re-create Windows on the World.
Equinox's owners play down comparisons between the New York and
Singapore restaurants, but the original idea was to make Equinox an
Asian echo of Windows.</TE>
<TE>   To some who remember the New York complex, the resemblance is
striking.</TE>
<TE>   Len Pickell, president of the James Beard Foundation in New York,
said he had "goose bumps the size of marbles" when he walked into
Equinox in April.</TE>
<TE>   "Going up the elevator, the doors popped open and there was
Windows," he recalled. "I kind of froze there. It was a very eerie
feeling--here's another one, so far away from New York."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ginor, an owner of the Hudson Valley Foie Gras purveyor in
New York, said Equinox struck him as a next-generation Windows. "It
definitely had similarities," he said. "But it seemed to be more
modern than Windows, also more uber-designed and highly interior
decorated."</TE>
<TE>   The two restaurants shared the same design consultants--Joseph
Baum &amp; Michael Whiteman Co. in New York--and a similar concept. Both
were multistory restaurant and bar complexes on top of tall buildings
and commanding panoramic views. Both had the same goal of making the
food the main attraction. But managers of the Singapore complex see
more differences than similarities.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the same people worked on it, but this is a unique
concept in itself," said Richard C. Helfer, chairman and chief
executive of Raffles International Hotels &amp; Resorts, which owns
Equinox and the Raffles City complex where it's located. "It's a
positive thing that part of Windows lives on, but it's not what we
set out to do."</TE>
<TE>   From New York, Michael Whiteman agreed: "It was not inspired by
Windows but it has a lot in common. I think you could say there is
some DNA relationship."</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, Equinox chose not to emphasize the ties between
the two establishments. "They downplayed the connection between
Windows and this restaurant," said Whiteman, referring to Equinox's
owners. "Originally it had been part of the marketing idea," Whiteman
said. "When the World Trade Center went down, they made the decision
not to make that connection."</TE>
<TE>   Equinox is designed to appeal primarily to Asian tastes. Although
it is on top of the 1,200-room Swissotel The Stamford, it aims to
cater to a clientele that is 80% Singaporean. "Singapore and New York
are as different as cheese and chocolate," said Helfer, a Michigan
native who has lived in Singapore for 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   By and large, Singaporeans are more subdued than New Yorkers.
Dissent is frowned upon, and Singaporeans keep their opinions to
themselves. The city-state's government is so strict, it has banned
the import of chewing gum and requires citizens to flush public
toilets or face a fine. But Singaporeans are proud of the cleanliness
and efficiency of their city.</TE>
<TE>   The Equinox complex fits well in that setting. Visitors first
arrive at the Introbar on the ground floor where they can have a
drink before taking a 45-second ride to the 70th floor in an express
elevator.</TE>
<TE>   Customers can then choose among the showcase Equinox restaurant,
the more upscale Jaan restaurant, the intimate City Space bar, or the
more hip New Asia Bar &amp; Grill. Before its destruction, the Windows
complex included the showcase Windows on the World restaurant; Wild
Blue, an upscale intimate restaurant of 60 seats; and the Greatest
Bar on Earth, a sprawling room anchored by a showy circular bar.</TE>
<TE>   The Equinox complex extends from the 68th to 72nd stories of the
Stamford tower, one of the city's tallest buildings. Windows was on
the 106th and 107th floors of the World Trade Center's north tower.</TE>
<TE>   The Equinox decor includes such features as three-story teak and
rice-paper lanterns inspired by Ming dynasty designs, Murano crystal
from Venice hanging from the ceilings and what the owners call the
largest mother-of-pearl wall in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Windows was restrained in comparison, Whiteman said, an L-shaped
room with a terraced floor designed to emphasize the view.</TE>
<TE>   The Equinox restaurant features separate Western and Asian menus,
and the food is prepared in separate kitchens. The idea is that local
Singaporeans, who can find many restaurants in the city serving good,
inexpensive Asian food, will want to eat Western-style food at
Equinox, while visitors from outside Singapore are more likely to
want Asian food.</TE>
<TE>   Equinox makes a point of serving the same item in both styles. For
example, one can order grilled wild Scottish salmon with morels,
leeks and peas and a lemon butter sage sauce; or oolong-tea-smoked
Tasmanian salmon with Chinese cabbage, wood-ear mushrooms and a
Chinese rice wine sauce.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not fusion," said Julian van den Bogaerde, Raffles' vice
president for food and beverages.</TE>
<TE>   A small, semiprivate area of Equinox can be curtained off for a
romantic dinner for two. In the 10 months since the restaurant has
been open, the table has witnessed 42 marriage proposals, said Ronald
Loges, Equinox general manager. "As far as I know, none of them have
declined," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Jaan restaurant is Raffles' second. The first Jaan opened last
year in Beverly Hills at the Raffles L'Ermitage hotel. The menu
features French food with Khmer flavorings, and wine pairings that
recommended a different wine by the glass for each course. A third
Jaan recently opened in Montreux, Switzerland, and a fourth is
scheduled to open next month in London.</TE>
<TE>   At Equinox, one small touch borrowed from Windows on the World can
be found in the New Asia Bar: The floor slopes downward 20 degrees to
accentuate the view.</TE>
<TE>   The bar, which offers dancing and stays open until 3 a.m.,
features "sophisticated street food" that is designed to be shared,
Loges said: dim sum, sate, sushi, sashimi, crustaceans and oysters.
Upstairs, regular patrons can buy a bottle of spirits and keep it
there for future visits.</TE>
<TE>   The Equinox complex was built in the space previously occupied by
the Compass Rose restaurant and bar. Rather than having one
restaurant and one bar, the new design divided the space into
smaller, more intimate rooms while increasing the usable area by 32%.
Kitchen size was greatly reduced, opening up new views to the east.
Now, much of the food preparation is done in the basement and the
ingredients are brought up by elevator.</TE>
<TE>   In the months since the Sept. 11 attack, Singaporean diners have
shown no trepidation about dining at the top of a skyscraper.
Already, business is double that of Compass Rose.</TE>
<TE>   For Ginor, Equinox felt far removed from New York. "I hate to say
it, but being in Singapore, I didn't really put one and one
together," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But at least one New Yorker found the experience unsettling.</TE>
<TE>   "It was exciting to see such a great spectacle, amazing to have
such a beautiful view," Pickell said. "But to be honest, I was
uncomfortable the whole time."</TE>

pounds, when completed.</TE>
<TE>   Nick &amp; Stef's Chocolate Cake</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 1  1/2 hours * Total Preparation Time: 3 hours,
plus 10 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   CAKE</TE>
<TE>   3 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   1 cup cocoa</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon baking soda</TE>
<TE>   3 cups water</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups oil</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   5 eggs</TE>
<TE>   3 1/3 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 10-inch springform pan with
a removable bottom, line it with parchment paper, and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Sift together the flour, cocoa, salt and baking soda. In a
separate bowl mix together the water, oil and vanilla.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the eggs in the bowl of an electric mixer, then mix in the
sugar. Mix in the water mixture in thirds, alternating with thirds of
the sifted dry ingredients, scraping down the sides of the bowl with
a rubber spatula between each addition. Mix until smooth.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 20 minutes; reduce the
oven temperature to 325 degrees and bake until a toothpick inserted
into the middle of the cake comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Place the pan on a rack and cool the cake to room temperature.
Remove it from the pan and split into 3 equal parts horizontally.
Trim the top layer of the cake to make it flat. Place 1 round of cake
back into the pan, then prepare the mousse.</TE>
<TE>   MOUSSE</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   3 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   1 cup half-and-half</TE>
<TE>   1 pound semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 cups whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   Beat the sugar and yolks in a mixer until pale and thick, about 5
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, bring the half-and-half to a boil in a saucepan over
medium heat. Pour about 1/2 cup into the yolk mixture, whisking
constantly. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over
medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens,
about 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Place the chocolate in a large bowl and pour the hot mixture over
it. Let stand 1 to 2 minutes, then stir until the chocolate has
melted and the mixture is smooth and shiny.</TE>
<TE>   Whip the cream in another bowl until soft peaks form, about 5
minutes. Fold 1/3 of the cream into the chocolate mixture, then fold
in the remaining cream.</TE>
<TE>   Spread half the mousse onto the bottom cake layer in the pan, then
place the middle cake layer on top. Spread the rest of the mousse
over it, then place the top cake layer on top. Wrap the cake well in
plastic wrap and freeze it overnight.</TE>
<TE>   CHOCOLATE GANACHE</TE>
<TE>   GLAZE</TE>
<TE>   1 pound semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 cups whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup light corn syrup</TE>
<TE>   Place the chocolate in a bowl. Bring the whipping cream and syrup
to a boil in a saucepan, then pour over the chocolate. Let the
chocolate melt, about 1 to 2 minutes, then mix to blend completely.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the frozen cake from the cake pan and place on a rack. Pour
1/2 the glaze over the cake and spread it so that it goes down the
sides. Remove the cake from the rack and place on a platter.
Refrigerate the cake until the glaze sets, 1 hour. Place the cake
back on the rack and pour the remaining glaze over the top. Return
the cake to the platter and refrigerate again for the glaze to firm,
1 hour. Let the cake stand at room temperature awhile before serving.</TE>

<HD>The Harvest Brings Hope for Vintage 2002</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The blackberries are finished in the Russian River Valley. The air
smells like apples. It's time to pick Pinot Noir.</LD>
<LD>   As of this week, the 2002 vintage is shaping up to be superb.
That's a flash of good news for an industry that otherwise has little
to crow about. Slow sales, the resulting oversupply of wine grapes,
and aggressive competition from opportunistic foreign producers have
Golden State vintners reeling.</LD>
<LD>   The early harvest of high-acid, low-sugar grapes for sparkling
wines is winding down on North Coast vineyards. Now the heart of the
batting order comes up--leading off with Pinot, then on to Sauvignon
Blanc, Zinfandel, Chardonnay, Merlot and Syrah. Last comes the
cleanup hitter, Cabernet Sauvignon.</LD>
<TE>   As the steel-nerved Cabernet growers sweat out the possibility of
early rain, the much-anticipated Pinot harvest is kicking into gear
in the coastal valleys north of San Francisco. The summer cycle of
alternating heat and fog has brought grapes in the coastal regions of
Sonoma, Mendocino and Napa counties to the brink of magnificent
ripeness.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Hampton Bynum toiled up and down steep vine rows in
Green Valley, just south of the Russian River in western Sonoma
County, filling a plastic bag with grapes from throughout the
vineyard. Every once in a while, one or two would find their way into
his mouth. "Mmm," he said. "They really taste good, almost ready to
pick."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps there have been sweeter grape growing seasons. It would
have been nice for a lot of growers to skip this year's unseasonable
late-spring rains--although then the crop would have been bigger and
the quality probably lower. And it would have been more peaceful if
there hadn't been any heat spikes in July and August--but then the
grapes wouldn't have such chewy skins full of thick, soft tannins.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just starting to pick, and we're really happy with the
fruit," said Bynum, who bottles half a dozen Pinots each year under
the Davis Bynum label established by his father. "It's a fairly small
crop, but the ripeness is pretty uniform and we're seeing wonderful
flavor at fairly low sugars."</TE>
<TE>   Translation: Expect vibrant, delicious wines with decent alcohol
levels.</TE>
<TE>   A Vintage Story</TE>
<TE>   Picking was also underway at Truchard Vineyards in Carneros,
another cool, Pinot-oriented area. "We started Pinot yesterday," Jo
Ann Truchard said last week. "We've had an incredibly cool summer,
but some of our new Dijon clones are ripe already. The Pinot tastes
wonderful." Jo Ann and her husband, Tony, sell fruit to 30 wineries.</TE>
<TE>   Every vintage tells a story. Some are dream-come-true fairy tales,
like 1997's rare combination of large crop and superb quality. Others
are tales of intrigue and ultimate betrayal, like the roller-coaster
season of 1989 that ended with much of the crop being washed out by
hard September rains.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from a rather stormy May and a few blast-furnace days in
late summer, the 2002 growing season has been moderate. Pretty
boring, in fact.</TE>
<TE>   Boring sounds good to a grape grower. No news is good news to
anyone in agriculture, and grape growers in particular because of the
large sums of money at stake. With top-quality Pinot Noir currently
worth $3,000 to $5,000 a ton, growers are relieved that '02 was a
slow-news summer.</TE>
<TE>   This is a critical time in vineyards throughout the Northern
Hemisphere. Last week vintners in Barolo, Italy, sobbed over a
potentially magnificent crop destroyed by hail, while vignerons in
Bordeaux begged the sun god to smile on their underripe grapes. In
Northern California, they're simply hoping the offshore Pacific high
pressure system keeps storms at bay just a little bit longer.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone is acutely conscious that meteorologists are predicting a
sodden winter, courtesy of El Nino. El Nino winters often start early
with big September rains. That would not only put a damper on the
harvest, it would aggravate the economy's negative effects on the
grape market. But the only thing to do is wait: The grapes aren't
ripe until they're ripe.</TE>
<TE>   The Changing Grape</TE>
<TE>   A growing season starts as a clean slate. Day by day, the
potential character and style of the year's wines develop on the
vine. The early period sets the general parameters for the vine's
growth and for how the fruit will develop. As the season progresses,
the characteristics of the eventual wine are redefined day by day in
response to weather.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning the vine is preparing for veraison, the point
in the season (usually mid-July) where the grapes change from their
uniform flat green color to show their variety. Black grapes begin to
show pink with increasingly darker shades of purple. White grapes go
from green to gold, and in some cases (such as Gewurztraminer) into
pink tones.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, between the time the clusters develop until around
mid-July, there is virtually no appearance of change in the hard,
green orbs. Don't be fooled, said an expert in grape ripening.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas O. Adams, a professor of viticulture and enology at UC
Davis, explained it this way: "We've just come to realize that the
berry gets poised for that change well before the actual event, which
represents a major change in the physiology of the berry.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes from an organ that is accumulating acids to one that is
metabolizing acids, from an organ that's not accumulating sugar to
one that's accumulating sugar at a higher rate than any other fruit
we know about. A berry right before veraison contains very little
sugar. Right after veraison it can jump to 5% sugar in a few days."</TE>
<TE>   Here Come the Reds</TE>
<TE>   Next up will be Zinfandel and related varieties in warmer areas
such as the Dry Creek and Alexander valleys. Near Geyserville at
Ridge Vineyards' Lytton Springs vineyard, workers picked Sauvignon
Blanc over the weekend, and now attention is turning toward the big
reds.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, David Gates, Ridge's vineyard manager, was also
popping grapes into his mouth as he walked rows of bushy, tree-like
old Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Grenache vines.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing you get is a real sweet, grapy flavor," he said.
"Then you spit out seeds and bite the skin and get a blast of tannin.
Some of the tannins are still chalky or grainy, but they're softening
fast. And this year the flavors are really good at low sugar. That's
good in grapes, and good in wines."</TE>
<TE>   Gates expressed hope and defiance at the prospect of early rain.
"Everybody that's got an arthritic toe says it's going to rain like
hell this year," he said. "The forecasters say it could start early.
But if it waits three more weeks so we can get all the Zinfandel in,
I don't care what happens."</TE>

Rhone Valley, France</DH>

<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the Rhone Valley, the 2000 vintage was fantastic, especially in
the south. Paul Avril's Chateauneuf-du-Pape "Clos des Papes" is
consistently one of the best in the appellation, and unlike some of
the other stars in Chateauneuf, somewhat underpriced. It's rare to
get both power and elegance, but Avril has achieved it. This is a
benchmark Chateauneuf, absolutely gorgeous. Drink it now or stow it
away for a special evening.</LD>
<LD>   About $38. Available at Wine Exchange in Orange, (714) 974-1454
and The Wine Club in Santa Ana, (714) 835-6485.</LD>

<HD>Over Tuna and Toast, They Discuss Final Chapters</HD>
<DH>A group of retired TV and film writers, subject of a
documentary, meets weekly to chat, remember and argue a little.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lunch lasted an hour or two and featured a shouting match between
Fred Freiberger and Dr. Norman Lavet. This being a regular Tuesday
lunch of aging Jewish men, the argument started with Israel but ended
up on Iraq, with Freiberger and Lavet exchanging heated words. The
other men at the table watched, as used to this as to the tuna fish.
A TV in the far corner was broadcasting the horse racing from Del
Mar. Finally, Leon Roth, a former professor at the USC film school,
spoke.</LD>
<LD>   "For whatever it's worth," he said, for the benefit of a reporter
who had joined the men today, "there were a couple of guys here who
were very funny."</LD>
<LD>   They are former motion picture and television writers--men, for
the most part, who are out of the game, but not before they
contributed mightily to the pantheon of televised entertainment. They
made good money if not silly money. They wrote for "All in the
Family," "The Flying Nun," "Chico and the Man." They wrote movies
including "If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium."</LD>
<TE>   It is a not uncommon milieu in Los Angeles, these informal
gatherings of older writers in delis and cafes; this one happens
every Tuesday at the Mulholland Tennis Club, up in the hills, the San
Fernando Valley in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, David Zeiger wanted to film the men. The result, the
documentary "Funny Old Guys," is 40 minutes long and will screen for
the next seven days at Laemmle's Monica 4-Plex in Santa Monica, as
part of the Doctober Fest, a documentary film festival.</TE>
<TE>   "Funny Old Guys" starts out as you might expect, given that Zeiger
began with the intention of capturing the banter among seven or eight
writers whose careers encompass everything from the Hollywood
blacklist to "The Love Boat."</TE>
<TE>   Unexpectedly, one of them, Frank Tarloff, a blacklisted
screenwriter who left the country for 12 years and went on to win an
Academy Award for the 1964 film "Father Goose," as well as write for
"The Danny Thomas Show" and "The Dick Van Dyke Show," discovers his
cancer has recurred. Suddenly, Tarloff faces mortality, and the
lunches take on a new tone.</TE>
<TE>   So, too, does the film, as Tarloff gamely allows Zeiger to
document his dying process.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview recently at the Mulholland club, as Zeiger and The
Times waited for the funny old guys to show up for lunch, the
filmmaker talked not only about Tarloff's mortality but the health
issues that continue to catch up to the group. Mike Morris, whose
resume reads like the entire programming schedule for Nick at Nite
("All in the Family," "McHale's Navy," "The Smothers Brothers Show"),
has Alzheimer's. "We literally caught the last phase of his
lucidity," Zeiger said.</TE>
<TE>   Zeiger's father, Irv, was one of the founders of the tennis club
in the late '60s. David Zeiger worked on "Funny Old Guys" as he was
shooting and editing "Senior Year," a 13-part documentary following
15 seniors at Fairfax High School that aired on PBS earlier this
year. "Senior Year" was an ambitious, all-consuming work, Zeiger
said, and so "Funny Old Guys" became a kind of escape. He shot much
of it with a hand-held camera, a microphone set up on a stand and
hanging over the table. Zeiger futzed with the mike as he ate his
lunch.</TE>
<TE>   On this particular Tuesday, the lunch group included David Shaw
("The Defenders," "Playhouse 90," "Quincy"), Bernie Kahn ("Get
Smart," "Love American Style"), Lavet, Freiberger (everything from
"Bonanza" to "Starsky &amp; Hutch") and Roth. Bernie West was supposed to
be here but was with his wife, who had taken ill.</TE>
<TE>   The food came--scoops of tuna over greens, eggs and toast, a
turkey burger. Kahn, one of the group's younger members, said he had
just seen the new movie "Full Frontal." "Just an awful movie," he
said. "I was in pain watching this movie."</TE>
<TE>   "How were the locations?" Lavet asked.</TE>
<TE>   "The locations?" Kahn said. "What do you mean?"</TE>
<TE>   "My son was the location manager."</TE>
<TE>   What about "Road to Perdition"? The table was unimpressed.</TE>
<TE>   "Hanks, who I love, I think just walked through that part,"
Freiberger said. "Now you're pulling for murderers. At least in 'The
Godfather,' which was a dangerous picture which I loved, you're
rooting for the crooks against the cops. But a wonderful picture!
This was just nothing."</TE>
<TE>   One of the more moving parts of "Funny Old Guys" is the decision
to stage Tarloff's memorial service before he dies, so that he too
can attend. A sign goes up at the Mulholland Tennis Club. Over lunch,
however, Tarloff didn't come up much. He was gone, and the guys were
pressing on, talking into the teeth of another hot day.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw said: "Last week, I got two checks from the Writers Guild, in
separate envelopes." One check was for $334. The other for $335. The
statements were almost identical.</TE>
<TE>   The guild guy told him to keep the one for $335.</TE>
<TE>   "Funny Old Guys" will screen with another film, "Venice: Lost and
Found," at Laemmle's Monica 4-Plex Theater, 1332 2nd St., Santa
Monica. Show times are: Friday at 4 p.m.; Saturday at 12:15 p.m.;
Sunday at 6 p.m.; Monday at 10 a.m.; Tuesday at 2:15 p.m.; Sept. 18
at 9:15 p.m.; Sept. 19 at 7:45 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Dual Natures</HD>
<DH>Wilco combines down-to-earth pragmatism and
eyes-on-the-stars dreaminess in a sold-out concert</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Tweedy conducted the first moments of Wilco's concert Monday at
the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre with the sober deliberation of a
warrior girding for battle, all clenched concentration and
eyes-tight-shut intensity.</LD>
<LD>   On the opening "Sunken Treasure," he finger-picked a single-chord
drone on his acoustic guitar, slowly pulling the other three
musicians into a hammering, percussive climax. When he came to the
title phrase of the third song, "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,"
all the instruments except the drums dropped away, leaving Tweedy
repeating the line like an incantation as he marched in place.</LD>
<LD>   At this point, you wondered what kind of state he was working
toward--private ritual or rock 'n' roll release?</LD>
<TE>   But all of a sudden Tweedy blinked his eyes as if coming out of a
trance. As the band strummed the opening chords of the next song,
"War on War," he began strolling around the stage and making eye
contact with fans. Before long he was a full-blown stand-up comedian,
bantering easily and at length with the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Tweedy's transformation could serve as a literal representation of
his Chicago-based band's dual nature--down-to-earth pragmatism and
eyes-on-the-stars dreaminess.</TE>
<TE>   Wilco began as a so-called alt-country band, but soon there were a
lot more Beach Boys, Rolling Stones and Replacements in the mix, and
although being difficult to pin down has probably contributed to the
group's commercial limitations, it's also attracted and solidified
one of pop's most substantial cult followings.</TE>
<TE>   After a well-publicized art-versus-commerce split with Reprise
Records last year and the recent release of a documentary film that
charted that episode, the band's profile--and its perceived status as
champion of artistic integrity--has never been higher.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that added edge, Monday's concert (the first of two
sold-out nights at the Ford) was refreshingly unburdened by any
self-congratulatory posturing along those lines.</TE>
<TE>   The musicians went about their business with a direct, blue-collar
approach and rapport to spare, intensifying the rock tunes and
applying light touches to the more spacious arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   Tweedy, bassist John Stirratt and keyboardist-guitarist Leroy Bach
would often step aside to flank drummer Glenn Kotche, making him the
center of attention as he contributed distinctive touches with his
chimes and cymbals or pounded a rocker into submission.</TE>
<TE>   Additional musician Mike Jorgensen came and went throughout the
show, generating sounds from his laptop, and Scott McCaughey and Ken
Stringfellow from the second-billed Minus 5 periodically chipped in
on percussion and keyboards, stirring up a communal spirit.</TE>
<TE>   The songs from the new Wilco album, "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"
(released by Nonesuch Records), with their pairing of achingly
beautiful melody and atmospheric abstraction, were prominent, but it
was 1996's unruly two-CD set "Being There" that dominated, with
selections ranging from the meditative "Sunken Treasure" to the
rocker "Misunderstood," a platform for a Sonic Youth-level
instrumental freakout.</TE>
<TE>   Wilco also included two of its songs from "Mermaid Avenue," its
1998 collaboration with Billy Bragg on some unpublished Woody Guthrie
lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   These stylistic leaps somehow seemed inevitable, unified by one of
pop music's most evocative and emotional sensibilities. If Tweedy was
indeed trying the break his listeners' hearts--and judging from his
music that's one of his highest aims--he should consider Monday's
show an unqualified success.</TE>

<DH>The big-box superstore has key symbolic roles in 'One Hour
Photo' and 'The Good Girl,' showing great emotional range. All it
needs now is an agent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH HORNBLOW</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The film world's budding superstar has a great rack.</LD>
<LD>   Lots and lots of racks, actually. And shelves. Acres and acres of
shelves.</LD>
<LD>   The film world's emerging star is the superstore, the hangar-size
apotheosis of American abundance; the high temple of consumerism,
avarice, instant gratification; the appealing but benighted notion
that it is actually possible in some corners of life to get "more for
less."</LD>
<TE>   The superstore is supremely photogenic. There is no such thing as
a bad angle amid the orderly shelves of shiny, colorful merchandise
packaged for maximum eye appeal. The clinically bright lighting
leaves no discomfiting shadows, no disturbingly darkened recesses.
The Muzak oozing from the sound system is, with apologies to Karl
Marx, an opiate of the masses.</TE>
<TE>   The superstore steals the show in Mark Romanek's feature film "One
Hour Photo" and nearly manages a similar trick in Miguel Arteta's
"The Good Girl," albeit on a more restrained scale.</TE>
<TE>   Romanek, who cut his teeth on Nine Inch Nails and Madonna music
videos before writing and directing "One Hour Photo," cannot get
enough of the sterile expanses of the SavMart where the film's
protagonist, Robin Williams' Sy the Photo Guy, processes pictures.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Good Girl," Arteta's Retail Rodeo, a dated small-town
shopper's paradise, functions as the visual manifestation of the
boredom in the life of Jennifer Aniston's restless housewife, Justine
Last.</TE>
<TE>   In both pictures, the superstore is a paradox. The stores are
crammed full of merchandise--toys and computer supplies and makeup
and sunglasses--but they constitute visual metaphors for absolute
emptiness.</TE>
<TE>   Sy's life is so howlingly void that he fills up his head and his
fantasy life with scenes from the lives of others, in particular the
snapshots of the Yorkin family, whose film he develops. Aniston's
bored Justine is looking for a "last best chance." She needs a
nameless something, a wind of change (in the awkward metaphor used in
Mike White's otherwise delicious script). Justine needs an "unlived
life" that has nothing to do with what's available at the cosmetics
counter or in the aisle of household cleaning products.</TE>
<TE>   At Salon.com, Charles Taylor suggests that Romanek's "One Hour
Photo" "wants to show that Americans are living in a zombified
wasteland of consumer-generated fantasies because they have no
identity of their own."</TE>
<TE>   The film doesn't quite make the case, but Romanek's strikingly
photographed superstore has drawn comparisons to Stanley Kubrick's
space station in "2001: A Space Odyssey."</TE>
<TE>   The superstore has not always been cast in unflattering roles.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2000 movie "Where the Heart Is," a WalMart becomes a home
away from home for a pregnant young woman (Natalie Portman) who has
been abandoned by her boyfriend. Portman's noble but poor Novalee
Nation manages to live in the store, where she keeps precise accounts
of all the merchandise she borrows so she can pay for it later. She
gives birth there.</TE>
<TE>   The superstore hosts another hideaway in 1991's "Career
Opportunities." Frank Whaley's Jim Dodge is hired as night watchman.
After he discovers Jennifer Connelly's rich girl, Josie, accidentally
locked inside, the pair turn the place into a kind of play land. It's
a "Home Alone" scenario (also scripted by John Hughes) with a Target
store standing in for the home.</TE>
<TE>   The superstore, be it a wonderment or a wasteland, has all the
makings of a serious superstar. In every performance, it is
everything that is right and wrong with American life.</TE>

<AU>GREG KOT</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--In Midtown Manhattan, a party the size of several city
blocks was in full swing, celebrating three of the great American
pastimes: arena rock, football and making money.</LD>
<LD>   Bon Jovi was on a huge makeshift stage in Times Square, where
500,000 revelers gathered and brought traffic to a standstill as the
National Football League kicked off its season with a
multimillion-dollar display of chest-thumping. It contrasted sharply
with another, smaller party underway 35 blocks to the south, marking
the 10th anniversary of the Chicago independent label Thrill Jockey
Records.</LD>
<LD>   Over three nights that concluded early Sunday, 18 of the label's
acts performed at Union Plaza and the Bowery Ballroom to a total
audience of about 2,500--the last two nights sellouts. This was not a
smashing success by the standards of Bon Jovi, the NFL or any major
record label, but in an independent scene that thrives on a small but
discerning and intensely committed audience, it was a rousing
success.</LD>
<TE>   In 1992, Bettina Richards, 37, quit a cushy job as a major-label
talent scout to run Thrill Jockey out of her New York City apartment.
Soon after, she moved to Chicago, because the cornerstone acts of her
label--Tortoise, the Sea and Cake, Freakwater, Eleventh Dream
Day--were based there. She now runs her operation out of an office on
the south side of the city, and her operation is emblematic of a
Chicago music scene with a long tradition of doing things differently
than the multinational conglomerates that dominate the record
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Even in a city where indie labels rule, Thrill Jockey is something
of an oddity, its mishmash roster encompassing everything from free
jazz to hip-hop. The New York shows put that mind-blowing variety on
display over three nights, quietly challenging the belief proffered
by commercial radio and big record labels that consumers like their
music in narrow, easy-to-comprehend slices. If that's true, the
opening-night juxtaposition of Bobby Conn and Fred Anderson bordered
on the absurd. And what to make of a bill that included both 8 Bold
Souls, a brass-heavy octet that straddles the worlds of Duke
Ellington and Sun Ra, and the German electronics duo Mouse on Mars?
Yet it all somehow worked, the audience respectful of even the subtly
articulated ambient soundscapes of Vienna's Radian, and the
one-man-band novelties of the Lonesome Organist.</TE>
<TE>   Conn and his violin-playing sidekick, Monica BouBou, came dressed
in drag for the occasion, the mascara dribbling down the singer's
cheeks providing visual counterpoint to his mock-opera tales of
decadence, drugs and misguided dreams. He was a glam-rock Sammy Davis
Jr., his falsetto dramatics evoking Iron Maiden, "Soul Train" and
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show." The regal Anderson followed, hunched
over his tenor saxophone with an intensity that at first seemed to
cow his young accompanists, guitarist Jeff Parker and drummer Chad
Taylor. When Parker took a solo as if he were carefully threading his
way through a minefield, Anderson swept underneath him with a
well-timed series of low notes, throwing a protective sonic bearhug
around his protege.</TE>
<TE>   If Parker understandably deferred to the legendary Anderson, he
was very much at home in Tortoise's two headlining shows. The
guitarist brought a sense of play to the tight arrangements, his
dissonant incisions and oblique chord choices frolicking over John
Herndon's complex yet enthusiastically insistent time signatures.
Backing singer-songwriter Sue Garner on a tumultuous version of Yoko
Ono's "We're All Water," Parker morphed from Chet Atkins-style
country licks to James "Blood" Ulmer-style note clusters.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor was mesmerizing in tandem with Rob Mazurek as the Chicago
Underground Duo, which stands at the nexus of free jazz and
avant-garde electronics. The drummer tapped out melodies on
vibraphone even as he kept the groove rolling on his trap-kit, while
Mazurek played trancy cornet patterns over funhouse rhythm loops
generated on computer.</TE>
<TE>   The category-defying approach reached its zenith with 8 Bold
Souls, which blended the melodicism of traditional big-band jazz in
the ensemble passages with a futuristic, experimental zeal in the
solos. Isaiah Jackson's staccato bursts stretched well beyond the
be-bop cliches associated with the trombone, while Harrison Bankhead
brought a thundering authority to his contra-bass lines that kept the
volatile ensemble swinging madly.</TE>
<TE>   Mouse on Mars exuded a similar charm and virtuosity, albeit with a
different set of tools. Andi Toma and Jan St. Werner stood behind a
mass of wires, samplers and computers, generating beats and then
mutating them on the fly. They improvised a 30-minute psychedelic
collage of beats, tones and sound effects, from bullfrog croaks to
backfiring vacuum cleaners, all the while rocking the house with a
set aimed at both rearranging heads and realigning hips.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not know what to expect," St. Werner said the next night of
the audience's roaring response. "But it was good. The audience
seemed ready for anything, even us."</TE>
<TE>   St. Werner was attending the festival's final night as a fan, not
as a performer. The computer guru from Germany applauded Prewitt, the
Chicago guitarist who paid tribute from the stage to the label that
the two artists from different musical worlds improbably share.</TE>
<TE>   "Good things endure," Prewitt said. "So see you through the next
10 years."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>PBS will broadcast an ambitious special next week, "Endgame: Ethics
and Values in America," which presents a fictional scenario, in a
short dramatic film, to spark an exploration of ethics, complete with
a panel discussion and interactive component allowing viewers to
weigh in.</LD>
<LD>   To which some of you might say: Television advocating ethical
behavior? Talk about the odd couple. What's next, Wile E. Coyote
educating youth on the need to protect the poor endangered
Roadrunner?</LD>
<LD>   Let's face it: The television industry's relationship with ethics
is fitful at best, more on the order of casual acquaintances than
true romance. The two nod politely when their paths cross, but it's
not like they hang out together.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, for all the soul-searching that was supposed to be
inspired by the events that took place a year ago, author Haynes
Johnson turned out to be right when he predicted on "Nightline" days
after the attacks that it wouldn't take long for the nation to "go
back to our delights and diversions."</TE>
<TE>   The task of delighting and diverting is clearly a formidable one,
not only because we live in financially challenging times but also
due to the sheer number of outlets vying to do so--a combination that
isn't particularly conducive to fostering ethics and values. In fact,
it leads programmers more in the direction of standing on the roof,
stripping their clothes off and screaming, just to get attention.</TE>
<TE>   How else, really, do you ascribe ethics to E! exploiting Anna
Nicole Smith in a series with all the depth and charm of a carnival
sideshow? Or CBS planning a miniseries about Hitler as a
youth--ostensibly to shed light on a how the man became a monster,
but realistically because it's sure to generate oodles of publicity?
Or providing TV forums to psychic mediums like John Edward and James
Van Praagh who talk to the dead--the executives responsible cloaking
their own skepticism so long as they see a buck to be made off the
living and grieving?</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, where do values connect with any number of programs
built around exhibitionists with questionable judgment, from "Big
Brother" to "Fear Factor" to "The Bachelor"? As if giving such
exposure to people desperate to be on TV wasn't enough, the media
then helps these contestants milk their 15 minutes of fame--exalting
those who prove most adept in the art of manipulation and promoting a
win-at-all-costs mentality, with the spoils going to those who
"outwit, outlast and outplay."</TE>
<TE>   And that's just what you see on screen. Anyone operating on
Hollywood's fringes has heard stories about agents undermining
colleagues or selling out one client to benefit another, executives
taking pains to torpedo projects from writers they don't like, or
producers spreading rumors to gain leverage in a negotiation--usually
all before lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the excesses of broadcast news, from the unsavory
jockeying of the network booking wars--including the frenzy to
interview teenage rape victims on camera, a contest "won" by "Today"
and Katie Couric--to synergistic promotion masquerading as news,
including news reports on CBS' local radio outlets plugging the
network's programs; to allegations of outright deception, such as
Geraldo Rivera's dispatch from what he erroneously said was a
"friendly fire" site in Afghanistan--"an honest mistake," Rivera
explained later, in which he was off by 100 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Still, when it comes to television and ethics, it may be a case
where those who can't do (or more accurately, those who don't do)
really can ... teach--and in this age of Enron and WorldCom, the
lessons could hardly be timelier.</TE>
<TE>   "Endgame" executive producer Scott Goldstein has been kicking
around this kind of multimedia project for years--long before those
corporate scandals or a former president quibbled over the definition
of the word "is."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fascinated by the things that people do when no one's
watching them," Goldstein said, adding that his goal is to avoid
being preachy or providing simple answers to complex issues.</TE>
<TE>   At its best, he noted, television dramas do precisely that--with
programs such as "The West Wing," "Law &amp; Order" and "The Practice"
concocting scenarios that invite viewers to ponder what they would do
in a similar situation where the admonishment to "do the right thing"
isn't always clear.</TE>
<TE>   "Endgame" will explore such points with ethicist Michael Josephson
and David Kaczynski, who turned in his brother, Theodore, as the
Unabomber. The program is also hosted by Carol Marin, who quit her TV
anchor job at WMAQ in Chicago in 1997, when the NBC-owned station
hired talk-show host Jerry Springer as a commentator.</TE>
<TE>   Although the flap generated national headlines, Marin, who has
since worked for "60 Minutes II," noted that it was hardly her first
skirmish over ethical concerns. In fact, she was briefly suspended
the year before when she refused to read copy that she says was
forced on the news department because of an advertising deal.</TE>
<TE>   The Springer incident "isn't a marker for me," she said. "I got
way too much credit for something that people do every day, because I
was on television and it involved Jerry Springer."</TE>
<TE>   Rather, Marin said people in television, and especially news,
regularly face tough decisions about the compromises required when
personal or professional standards and commerce come into conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "We sort of lose sight of the fact that this has never been a
pristine undertaking, this business of news and television," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Such choices are seldom easy, a point Goldstein (who previously
worked with Marin in Chicago as a TV news producer) hopes the special
will address--shifting the conversation from the obvious corporate
lawbreaker, say, to the whistle-blower whose actions could have
unintended consequences, such as putting friends and colleagues out
of a job.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really trying very hard not to go after obvious targets and
knock them down," Goldstein said, adding, "The color palette of this
show is black, white and gray."</TE>
<TE>   What a refreshing concept for TV, where, as most evidence suggests
one year after Sept. 11, green is still a primary color.</TE>
<TE>   "Endgame: Ethics and Values in America" will be shown next
Wednesday at 8 p.m. on KCET.</TE>

<LD>   Reeve Shows Progress on Medical Front</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Reeve has regained some movement and sensation in his
hands and feet, seven years after a horse-riding accident that left
him paralyzed from the neck down.</LD>
<TE>   The "Superman" star also can breathe on his own for 90 minutes at
a time, feel pinpricks on most parts of his body, raise his right
hand to a 90-degree angle and tell the difference between hot and
cold, according to the Sept. 23 issue of People magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The actor has received treatment for the last three years through
the "activity-based recovery program," a mix of electrical muscle
stimulation and repetitive motion exercises created by his doctor,
John McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   Reeve documents his progress in a new book, "Nothing Is
Impossible: Reflections on a New Life," and in a TV special to air
Sept. 18 on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   "No one who has suffered an injury as severe as Chris', and failed
to have any initial recovery, has regained the amount of motor and
sensory function he has," said McDonald, the medical director of the
spinal cord injury program at Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Reeve might walk again, the doctor said, "The fact that
he's having some recovery could make that a possibility."</TE>

<TE>   Catholic Hierarchy Protests Venice Film</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican has criticized the Venice International Film Festival
for giving its top prize, the Golden Lion, to Scottish director Peter
Mullan's "The Magdalene Sisters," a depiction of brutality in
Ireland's 1960s-era Catholic Magdalene convent schools, which have
since been abolished.</TE>
<TE>   "This film does not tell the truth about the church and is a
disgrace for the festival, which risks losing its stature," the
Hollywood Reporter quotes Cardinal Ersilio Tonini as saying. At least
one board member of the Venice Biennale, the parent organization of
the festival, also took issue with the Golden Lion choice.</TE>
<TE>   "My opposition to this is total, and I'm not talking as a
Catholic," said Valerio Riva. "Mullan's film is just bad propaganda."</TE>
<TE>   The artistic director of the film festival, Moritz de Hadeln,
defended the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a democracy where everyone can state their opinion," he
said. "But Riva's opinion does not coincide with that of Italian
audiences, as the film's box office results show." Since its Aug. 30
release in Italy, the movie has taken in $62,000 on 27 screens, a
credible showing there for an art house film.</TE>

<TE>   Jerusalem No-Show Triggers Controversy</TE>
<TE>   Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert has charged the deputy director of the
British Council in that city with using "cultural terror," convincing
two prominent violinists to cancel their participation in a major
concert later this month.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Jerusalem Post, Nigel Kennedy and Max Vengerov
had agreed to play in the Sept. 19 gala, a fundraiser for an arts and
cultural center for disabled youth sponsored by the New Jerusalem
Foundation, which Olmert heads.</TE>
<TE>   The musicians changed their minds, the mayor claimed, when the
official, David Codling, broke "all the rules of diplomatic
etiquette" by telling them that "their lives would be endangered" and
they would "incur the wrath of millions of Muslims" if they attended
such a "political" concert.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the British Council in Tel Aviv denied the
allegations. When Kennedy's agent called its Jerusalem office, he
said, Codling merely referred him to a British government Web site,
which contained a security travel advisory.</TE>
<TE>   "Strings Above Jerusalem" will go ahead as planned, featuring a
French singer, an Israeli countertenor and the Jerusalem Symphony
Orchestra.</TE>

<TE>   Harrison Tribute Album Is Due Next Year</TE>
<TE>   On the heels of an announcement that a CD containing new material
from George Harrison will be released in November comes the news that
some high-profile artists will be taking part in a tribute album to
the former Beatle, who died last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Songs From the Material World" is due out from KOCH on Feb. 25,
which would have been Harrison's 60th birthday. The Byrd's Roger
McGuinn, the Kink's Dave Davies, Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green
and John Lennon's son Julian are among the confirmed participants.</TE>
<TE>   McGuinn is expected to tackle "If I Needed Someone," Billboard
reports. And various artists will team up on Harrison's "While My
Guitar Gently Weeps."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Glenne Headly (TV's "Lonesome Dove," "ER") and David Hyde Pierce
("Frasier") will star in "The Guys," Anne Nelson's play about the
aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, at the Actors' Gang theater, Sept.
17 through Oct. 11.... George Stephanopoulos, host of ABC's "This
Week," and his wife, Alexandra Wentworth, are the parents of their
first child, a girl, Elliott Anastasia, born Monday.... "Star Wars:
Episode II Attack of the Clones," digitally remastered for a
large-screen format, will be shown at Imax theaters beginning Nov. 1
....The Venice Biennale's International Architecture Exhibition has

<HD>Heartthrob</HD>
<DH>Eduardo Verastegui is a star to Spanish-speaking audiences
but is unknown to most others. A new English-language film could
change that.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The steel barriers could barely hold the fans back when he appeared.</LD>
<LD>   "Eduardo! Eduardo!" one girl gasped, reaching out with her hand as
if trying to hold him.</LD>
<LD>   "I want a life-size chocolate doll of Eduardo that I can eat,"
cried another teenage fan.</LD>
<TE>   If you do not watch Spanish-language soap operas or read People en
Espanol, it is likely you have never heard of Eduardo Verastegui.
With his lean, chiseled features, jet-black hair and blue-green eyes
framed by black eyelashes, he certainly looks like a movie star--and
to Spanish speakers, Verastegui is a major heartthrob, on par with
Leonardo DiCaprio.</TE>
<TE>   But to spend a day with the 28-year-old Verastegui is to live in
L.A.'s two worlds--one Latino, one Anglo. In the Spanish-speaking
world, Verastegui is a rising star; in the English-speaking one he's
a virtual unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Those two worlds intersected recently on the set of Verastegui's
first English-language film, "Papi Chulo," which was being shot at
Pan Pacific Park in the Fairfax area of Los Angeles. An excited,
mainly Latino crowd gathered to watch the young star in action.
Female extras on the film knew him from his soap opera, "Tres
Mujeres" ("Three Women"), which was broadcast in the U.S. on
Univision. Some of the younger girls in the crowd also know him from
Jennifer Lopez's video "Ain't It Funny." Grasping their disposable
cameras, they pleaded with the guards to let them take a picture with
Verastegui, who was born in Mexico and now lives in L.A. As the crowd
grew larger, Verastegui walked over, quickly signing the loose pieces
of paper held out by his eager fans.</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly Hispanic people know who he is," said 15-year-old Karem
Cebrero. "Hispanic people will go see this movie and maybe a curious
white person."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Baruch, his manager, said he had never been with a client
who struck such a chord in one community while going unrecognized in
another--all in the same city. He remembers going to the annual
Fiesta Broadway in April and watching as the crowd screamed out
Verastegui's name while he sang his latest hit on stage.</TE>
<TE>   Take him wherever there are Latinos and he is treated like
royalty.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to eat at Dan Tana's and we go in and the valet parkers
are like 'Oh my God, it's Eduardo,' " recalled Baruch. "We sat down
and we got the best service because the busboys brought us out the
special this and the special that. My nanny, oh my lord! My nanny
almost collapsed" when Baruch invited Verastegui to his home.</TE>
<TE>   But among Anglos he is little more than a pretty face.</TE>
<TE>   On this afternoon, after filming scenes for "Papi Chulo,"
Verastegui took a walk to the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf at the nearby
Grove shopping center. He strolled through the new outdoor mall,
adjacent to Farmers Market, clad all in black with his shirt open but
nobody paid attention. The guy making the drinks behind the bar even
asked for Verastegui's name to later claim the double latte he
ordered.</TE>
<TE>   Verastegui feels the strangeness of his double life in Los
Angeles. He is somewhat taken aback by his anonymity in certain
circles here, though he admits that in Mexico he misses being able
"to eat a taco and get food all over my face" without people
noticing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's weird. I've been acting for nine years, I've done five
telenovelas [soap operas] and have recorded one [solo] album, and
there are people here who never in their lives have seen me," he
said, shrugging his shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his fame in Latin America, Verastegui was discovered by
Hollywood by chance--on an airplane.</TE>
<TE>   "I never give my card out. Never, never, never," said Christian
Kaplan, vice president of feature film casting for Fox Filmed
Entertainment, who spotted the former model on his way to Miami.
"Let's just say I give it out judiciously. I didn't know who he
was.... I go down to the baggage-claim area and he is getting hounded
by autograph whores.... All I knew was there was this guy and I was
working on a movie called 'Papi Chulo.' I gave him my card and hoped
he would call." ("Papi Chulo" means "hottie babe" in Spanish.)</TE>
<TE>   If some in Hollywood have their way, Verastegui will become the
next big Spanish-surname film star--following in the footsteps of
actors such as Jennifer Lopez, Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz.
After immersing himself in English-language classes, the Mexican
actor-singer was cast in "Papi Chulo," scheduled for release next
summer. Verastegui plays the title character--a lothario who is set
upon by three women he's dating simultaneously. He has signed with
Hollywood's latest management powerhouse, the Firm, and is
represented by the ICM agency.</TE>
<TE>   His handlers are choosing his parts carefully; they don't want him
cast forever as the hotblooded Latin. Nor do they want him
overexposed on the party circuit (to his disappointment, he was told
to avoid the Playboy Mansion parties). Since he lived in Miami for a
while, they advised him to dress with a little less South Beach flash
and more subdued L.A. cool.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about him being a Latin lover, it's about him being
established as an actor," said Baruch. "It's staying true to the
community that he comes from but also broadening his base."</TE>
<TE>   Verastegui, who studied acting in his native Mexico, is not the
only unknown in "Papi Chulo." Joining him is Sofia Vergara, a
Colombian soap opera actress and beauty queen; Jaci Velasquez, a
Christian pop singer; and Puerto Rican actress Roselyn Sanchez, best
known for her role in "Rush Hour 2."</TE>
<TE>   "We figured we would go with the next wave," said Elizabeth
Gabler, president of the studio's Fox 2000, noting that this is their
first Latino-dominant film. "It's new ground for us."</TE>
<TE>   There is plenty of room in the marketplace for a Latino romantic
comedy. Some executives point to the success of "My Big Fat Greek
Wedding" as proof that reaching out to a core audience can be
lucrative ("Greek," which cost $5 million, will likely gross $100
million by the end of the week). Jim Gianopolus, co-chairman of Fox
Filmed Entertainment, said only half-jokingly at a recent wrap party
for "Papi Chulo": "There are 2 million Greeks in America and 40
million Latinos. If 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' can do more than $50
million, by simple mathematics 'Papi Chulo' should do $1.6 billion."</TE>
<TE>   Gianopolus was pointing out a question that has bedeviled studios
for the past decade: how to tap into the vast, yet, for them, elusive
Latino audience? While Latinos form the fastest-growing moviegoing
audience in the United States, there has never been a Latino
box-office smash like "Greek Wedding" or "Waiting to Exhale."</TE>
<TE>   "We are still waiting for the big hit," said Santiago Pozo, head
of Arenas Entertainment, which recently formed a partnership with
Universal Pictures to produce and distribute Latin-themed movies.
Pozo, who has been marketing to the Hispanic market for more than 15
years, said most studios think of the Latino audience as "an
afterthought." In addition, the story line in many films is watered
down to the point where it becomes a caricature, losing the authentic
ethnic flavor that makes it special.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are trying to make salsa with ketchup, you will have a
total disaster," Pozo said. "Most of these movies are decaf--they are
Latin movies for Anglos."</TE>
<TE>   "Papi Chulo," the first film from director Linda Mendoza, is
hoping to reach the English-speaking audience while not alienating
the Latino audience. The movie was made in English so it would not
become a "foreign" film. And its sensibility is definitely American
Latino, said executive producer Tajamika Paxton.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Paxton says if the movie reaches only a fraction of the
Latino audience, it's possible they'll have a gold mine. "If just
one-third of the population went to the movie, then this would be a
success," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Verastegui wants more.</TE>
<TE>   "The forum for promotion in the United States has all been in
Spanish," he said, referring to Latino films distributed here. "As
much as you want to assimilate into the [English-language] culture,
you cannot erase who you are. But after making it in my country, the
ultimate goal is to make it in Hollywood--in English."</TE>

<HD>Trimmed Gusgus Shakes, but Artistic Hooks Are Missing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The playful Icelandic electronica group Gusgus whipped together
retro-trendy grooves of house, techno and synth-funk on Monday at the
El Rey Theatre, concocting a frothy, '80s-flavored mix with more than
a whiff of the Human League in such torchy numbers as "David."</LD>
<LD>   Dance enthusiasts embraced Gusgus as a late-'90s nine-piece
collective of filmmakers, actors, singers and DJs. But it stripped
down to three original members and new vocalist Urdur "Earth"
Hakonardottir for its third collection, "Attention," its first on
L.A.-based label Moonshine Music. On Monday the group launched its
first U.S. tour in three years, and the enthusiasm inside the packed
venue ranged from cautious to full-on digging the vibe.</LD>
<LD>   During the hourlong set, the players faithfully replicated the
burbling, pulsating disco drone of such numbers as "Dance You Down."
But the ironic recombination of old-school cheese and modern, skippy
beats didn't disguise the weakness of most of the hooks--although
there were a few genuinely sensual moments, such as the cheeky love
song "Unnecessary."</LD>
<TE>   Films projected on a movie-screen backdrop showed landscapes,
automobiles, waterfalls, etc., all linked by the image of a red
cartoon ball evoking Kubrick's "2001" monolith. Still, some longtime
fans might find Gusgus less thematically and artistically substantial
than before, its deeper messages abandoned for the shake-your-booty
mandate. It would seem that sometimes less isn't more after all.</TE>

<HD>9/11 Exhibit at Smithsonian</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Speakers at Tuesday's opening ceremony for an exhibit on Sept. 11 at
the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History included First
Lady Laura Bush and her predecessor, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
(D-N.Y.), and Secretary of State Colin Powell. But the loudest
applause and only standing ovation were reserved for Joseph Pfeifer,
a New York City Fire Department battalion chief who helped direct
rescue efforts at the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   Pfeifer's coat, hat and boots are on display in the exhibit hall.
So is a crowbar, used to break through gypsum wallboard. It was found
near the body of his brother, Kevin, a New York City Fire Department
lieutenant who died in the collapse of the towers.</LD>
<LD>   A day after the attacks, a group of soldiers and firefighters on
the roof of the Pentagon unfurled a giant American flag. On Tuesday,
they gave the flag to the museum.</LD>
<TE>   Army Pfc. Jeff Layne was one of the soldiers who brought the flag
onto the Pentagon roof. "We wanted to show the rest of the country
that our military is still standing strong, that it's going to take
more than a plane to destroy our military," Layne said.</TE>
<TE>   Also on display is the bent and distorted frame of a TV monitor
from the Pentagon. The set came from the work area where Brady
Howell, a 26-year-old intern, was killed in the attacks. "It really
brings back the emotions that I felt on Sept. 11," said his brother,
Regan, of Centerville, Utah. "There was the loss, the recognition
that there are evil people in the world and they need to be stopped.
I don't want America to ever forget those things."</TE>

<HD>'Amy' Lets More Stars Shine</HD>
<DH>Judi Dench dominated the play in London and New York, but
the L.A. County premiere of 'Amy's View' rounds out the
family-centric tale of 16 years of British cultural change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Hare's "Amy's View" takes a panoramic look at a 16-year span in
the lives of its characters and an indirect glimpse at cultural
changes in England between 1979 and 1995. But it feels surprisingly
detailed and solid, without the sketchy quality that often afflicts
plays that attempt to cover so much in less than three hours.</LD>
<LD>   In only four scenes, it offers some of the pleasures of a good
novel or even a great miniseries--and you won't know how heretical
the latter comparison is until you've seen the play.</LD>
<LD>   Hare doesn't explain everything for us, most notably one traumatic
event that happens offstage between scenes three and four. But this
development seems like one of life's unexpected twists, not like a
writer's contrivance. Earlier, the play has several other surprises
in store, and these feel more carefully plotted. They're woven in so
skillfully that they become strokes of masterful storytelling.</LD>
<TE>   Until recently, the play was seen primarily as a star vehicle for
Judi Dench in London and New York. The play's celebrity-free local
premiere, at South Coast Repertory in 2000, didn't get great reviews.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County premiere by International City Theatre in
Long Beach prominently promotes the casting of Carol Lawrence and
Susan Egan.</TE>
<TE>   But the play is the thing. True, the Dench-Lawrence character,
Esme, is a British stage star with definite diva traits. But two of
the other roles are almost as big and as complex. Even the three
smaller roles are distinctive.</TE>
<TE>   As the play opens, Esme's daughter Amy (Egan) and new beau Dominic
(John Berczeller) are at Esme's suburban London home, awaiting her
midnight return from an appearance on the West End. The widowed Esme
and Dominic have never met. Amy is nervous because she has a
confidential favor to ask of her mother.</TE>
<TE>   By the second scene, six years later, the tension between Esme and
Dominic is rising. He's a TV journalist and would-be filmmaker with
little regard for Esme's life in the theater. She sees him as an
interloper who isn't good for Amy. Amy is caught in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   In the third scene, in 1993, Esme has fallen off her pedestal. At
the advice of her loving neighbor and would-be husband (Shelly
Kurtz), she invested in financial schemes that tanked in the '90s.
This turn of events registers more strongly in America since the
bursting of the tech-boom bubble than it did a few years ago. The
last act finds Esme seeking solace in fringe theater.</TE>
<TE>   Although some have said that the balance of sympathy is tilted too
far toward Esme, she and Dominic are both individuals whose pride
goes before a fall. And Amy is a plucky but torn young woman whose
efforts to take control of her life are doomed.</TE>
<TE>   Esme's mother-in-law (Patricia Place) ages in the background, at
first querulously, then silently. But the appearance of a young actor
(Thomas Patrick Kelly) in the final scene suggests the beginning of a
new cycle of life.</TE>
<TE>   Under Jessica Kubzansky's direction, Lawrence lacks the impossibly
crisp diction that you would expect from an English stage star, but
she inhabits the role fully in every other way. Egan is an ideal
mirror for Amy's balancing act between the active and the passive.
Berczeller masters Dominic's cockiness and his later chastening.
Kurtz's avoidance of any hint of malice makes his character more and
more fascinating.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who was turned off by Hare's shallow "The Blue Room" should
give him another chance with "Amy's View."</TE>

<LD>Comfort is going to be hard to come by today, but if there's one
thing we'll take away from the wall-to-wall documentaries and news
reports on television, it's that others feel as bewildered, hurt and
uncertain as we do.</LD>
<LD>   Playwright Israel Horovitz gives voice to some of these feelings
in the 50-minute filmed monologue "3 Weeks After Paradise," being
presented tonight at 7 and 10 on cable's Bravo network.</LD>
<LD>   Horovitz--the 63-year-old writer of such plays as "Indian Wants
the Bronx" and "Park Your Car in Harvard Yard"--lives just minutes
from the World Trade Center site. A year ago today, he and his wife
heard the roar of a too-low jet and soon were filled with dread,
because their youngest son was in class at Stuyvesant High School,
adjacent to the trade center.</LD>
<TE>   The son returned home safe, but the horror of those minutes--when
Horovitz could only fear what terror might be raining down on the
school--profoundly affected him.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to check myself into an insane asylum today," he says as
artful black-and-white photography captures every line in his
careworn face. "I can't stop the nightmares or the daymares. I'm on a
plane, wrestling the hijackers to the floor. I am Superdad, saving
all the children of the Earth."</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks that follow, Horovitz falls into what he calls "a
doomsday depression" and worries about the future, especially for his
two youngest children. "I wonder if they'll ever get to university,
or if they'll go directly from high school to war."</TE>
<TE>   Horovitz--who wrote, directed and performed the piece--inserts
color snippets of home movies into his black-and-white monologue,
further personalizing his thoughts. If he errs, it is in his decision
to air his personal politics from time to time, which may set him
apart from some of his watchers.</TE>
<TE>   Most of this piece is universally felt, though.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a good time for people of imagination," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Nor for anyone else.</TE>

<LD>Enough viewers worshiped at the altar of "American Idol" to propel
Fox to historic ratings, as the 15-year-old network scored a
first-ever weekly victory without the benefit of a major sporting
event such as the Super Bowl or World Series, based on viewing
estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Beyond the talent showcase, which posted Fox's highest rating for
a regular series in more than 2 1/2 years, the network received
boosts from the movie "There's Something About Mary" and a football
overrun into prime time on the East Coast.</LD>
<LD>   Similarly, ESPN's two prime-time NFL contests last week easily
topped the cable standings; in fact, its Sunday telecast averaged
more than 12 million viewers, which would have ranked 10th among
network programs.</LD>
<TE>   CBS finished second, though the network could have just as easily
been called "CSI," since it repeated four installments of the crime
drama (three ranked in the top 10) to "warm up" various time periods
in advance of the new season. NBC countered with five hours of "Law &amp;
Order" and its spinoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Both shows played Sunday at 10 p.m., though ABC still drew its
best rating that night this summer with the movie "My Best Friend's
Wedding."</TE>

<HD>Stalled Jet Orders Total 500 at Boeing</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: The manufacturer says woes at carriers since
Sept. 11 have prompted delays on 40% of its backlog.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co. said Tuesday that it had rescheduled deliveries of 500
jetliners--more than a year's worth of production--since the Sept. 11
attacks sent many of its airline customers into a tailspin.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing's Seattle-based commercial jet unit, which has fired 30,000
workers and cut production in half over the last 12 months, has
pushed back deliveries of about 40% of its backlog of 1,232 aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   "We negotiated over 500 airplanes on their delivery timing [after
Sept. 11, 2001] and moved them out to the right because the U.S.
airlines couldn't take them," Boeing commercial jet Chief Executive
Alan Mulally told employees this week.</LD>
<TE>   The company shipped 527 jetliners in 2001 but plans to deliver
just 380 this year and as few as 275 in 2003 as many airlines fight
for their survival in the wake of a devastating travel slump.</TE>
<TE>   Mulally noted that 75% of Boeing's 2003 deliveries are slated for
carriers outside the United States, up from about 60% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Mulally cited those international deliveries to dispute a popular
theory that the company wants a strike by its 26,000-member
machinists union, which could walk out over a contract dispute as
soon as Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers--and
some Wall Street analysts--have asserted that Boeing may benefit from
a strike by saving millions in salaries at a time when many airlines
can wait for new planes.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing officials have warned that a strike could push some
customers to go with rival Airbus, which could overtake Boeing as the
world's largest commercial jet maker for the first time in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Mulally cautioned the union's members that a strike would only
make things worse for employees and could cause the company to weaken
its current three-year contract offer.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not going to get any better, and you know [it] is going to
be substantially worse. If we weaken Boeing by letting down the
customers, there is not [going to be] money around, and we are going
to do whatever we do," Mulally said.</TE>
<TE>   IAM members will vote Thursday and Friday on an offer including an
8% signing bonus plus wage increases of 2% and 2.5% in years two and
three, as well as a 20% increase in pension benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders have urged members to reject the contract, demanding
bigger pension increases and citing a lack of job security and
increased employee health-care costs in Boeing's offer.</TE>

<LD>Biosite Inc., maker of medical diagnostic tests, resolved a licensing
dispute with partner Xoma Ltd., which had alleged that Biosite
infringed patents. The news sent shares of San Diego-based Biosite up
25%, or $5.22, to $25.77 on Nasdaq. Berkeley-based Xoma rose 36 cents
to $5.91, also on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Biosite uses technology licensed from Xoma in manufacturing
antibodies for tests to detect drug overdoses and heart disease.</LD>
<LD>   Xoma, a biotechnology company, last year accused Biosite of
breaching the companies' contract and said it wanted to renegotiate
the 1999 agreement.</LD>

<LD>Stock trader Amr "Anthony" Elgindy was scheduled to be released from
jail in New York late Tuesday, after spending three months
incarcerated on charges he manipulated stock prices in a scheme with
FBI agents.</LD>
<LD>   He is expected to return to his home in San Diego after posting
bond of $2.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   Elgindy, 34, was arrested in May and, with four others, accused of
securities fraud and racketeering. The federal indictment alleges
that Elgindy, two other stock traders and two former FBI agents used
confidential government information to manipulate shares of companies
in "short-selling" schemes.</LD>
<TE>   Elgindy, who has pleaded not guilty, will be under house arrest in
San Diego and will have to wear an electronic bracelet that will
allow the government to track his movements.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy's bond was signed by seven family members and is secured
by five properties.</TE>
<TE>   One of Elgindy's associates accused in the indictment, Derrick
Cleveland, pleaded guilty to racketeering in July and has since been
cooperating with the government.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy is a well-known trader and former broker who operated Web
sites that singled out stocks for short selling--bets that the price
of a stock will decline.</TE>

<HD>First Alliance's Liquidation OKd</HD>
<DH>Courts: Settlement yields $75 million to borrowers and
lawyers who say the home-equity lender deceived customers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge approved a liquidation plan Tuesday for First
Alliance Corp., putting the finishing touches on a settlement that
will yield at least $75 million to borrowers and their lawyers who
contended that the Irvine home-equity lender routinely cheated its
customers.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement includes $20 million from First Alliance founder
Brian Chisick and his wife, Sarah, with the rest coming from the
assets of the company. After a $15-million payment to attorneys, the
18,000 borrowers will receive checks totaling at least $60 million.
That's an average of $3,300 each, though individual payments will
vary widely.</LD>
<LD>   First Alliance, which never admitted wrongdoing, filed for
bankruptcy protection in early 2000 amid a wave of lawsuits,
high-profile news exposes of its practices and a growing national
debate over abuses in sub-prime lending--loans to borrowers with
blemished or limited credit histories. In the end, the Federal Trade
Commission, AARP Foundation and six states including California
joined private plaintiffs in pursuing damages from First Alliance and
Chisick.</LD>
<TE>   Joel Winston, a top official in the FTC consumer-protection
division, said the settlement is by far the largest the FTC has
obtained in a lending case, although a still larger case is pending
against Citigroup Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "It should send a message to the rest of the industry," said
Winston, noting that First Alliance targeted lower-income and elderly
homeowners. "You don't deceive consumers and get a free ride. There's
a price to be paid."</TE>
<TE>   AARP had accused First Alliance of luring elderly borrowers across
the nation into taking out loans with hidden fees as large as $25,000
for every $100,000 borrowed.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the settlements approved this week, borrowers also
may recoup an undetermined amount from related lawsuits pending in
federal court in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Defendants in those suits include the insurers who carried
liability policies for the bankrupt mortgage company and the
securities firms that bankrolled First Alliance and sold its loans to
investors.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance probably will pay at least $14.5 million, those
involved in the case say. Settlements from the securities firms are
highly uncertain but could total tens of millions of dollars more.</TE>
<TE>   The latter litigation, a racketeering case filed in April by
prominent tobacco and securities-fraud plaintiffs' lawyers, is
especially high stakes. It will be closely watched by traders of
asset-backed securities--bonds backed by payments on mortgages,
credit cards, car loans and other revenue streams.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants in that action are Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.,
Prudential Securities and a securities unit of First Union Bank, now
part of Wachovia Corp. The firms provided credit lines to First
Alliance and helped it sell its loans, packaged as securities, to
investors. They have denied wrongdoing but declined to comment
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   That litigation, scheduled to begin early next year, resembles
lawsuits targeting Enron Corp. bankers such as Citigroup and J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co., said Brian Nottage of Economy.com.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it will have a chilling effect if it becomes standard
that you can sue the securitizers," Nottage said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana, who gave final
approval to the First Alliance settlement Monday and to the lender's
bankruptcy liquidation plan Tuesday, praised the often contentious
group of attorneys for working out a deal favorable to the borrowers.</TE>
<TE>   Chisick's attorney, Ronald Rus, didn't return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the complexity of the litigation, there were no objections
to the settlement, and a trustee is expected to take over the company
for final liquidation next month. Checks may start going out to First
Alliance borrowers by early next year, attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   First Alliance general counsel Jerry Hager said that holders of
the 3.5 million First Alliance shares still in public hands will
receive $1.50 for each share or what they paid for the stock,
whichever is lower.</TE>
<TE>   The stock, which once traded in the $20 range, was just above $2 a
share when First Alliance tumbled into bankruptcy.</TE>

<HD>Effects of Sept. 11 on Economy Likely to Prove Long-Lasting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To many economists, the terror attacks of Sept. 11 were like an
earthquake or other natural disaster-- devastating at the moment but
having no lasting effect on the U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   That is not the case.</LD>
<LD>   The attacks were a man-made disaster, not a natural one. And the
effects on the U.S. and global economy are profound and likely to be
very long-lasting.</LD>
<TE>   On a global level, major changes have begun in the military
posture of the United States and in regulations of domestic commerce
and foreign trade. The U.S. is making new economic commitments in
countries and regions where it has not had a presence before.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks have returned the U.S. to an era of concern for
security and high military spending resembling the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Some important consequences of Sept. 11 are more visible and
immediate. The slowdown in travel and tourism this year has taken a
toll on the airline industry. The future of prominent airlines is in
question.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, the downturn in foreign tourism has been
severe this year and poses a big question mark for the next few
years, as tourist authorities in Asia report a reluctance of
travelers to visit the U.S. when it is under threat of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   It is true, as economist Edward Leamer of UCLA's Anderson School
says, that the boost in federal spending and the drop in interest
rates immediately after Sept. 11's attacks helped end last year's
recession. Promotional sales in December and a buildup of inventories
in the first quarter of 2002 helped keep the economy growing this
year.</TE>
<TE>   But new costs are being imposed on the economy. On foreign trade,
for example, new legislation and regulations require that U.S.
Customs know the contents of each container coming into the ports of
Los Angeles and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Customs officials now are stationed at foreign ports, and
foreign government officials are going to be stationed at ports here
to help check cargoes. Importers must certify that they know the
contents of each container and many other matters. Surcharges may be
imposed on containers to pay for such security services, which
undoubtedly will be extended to air cargoes coming through Los
Angeles International and other airports.</TE>
<TE>   Defense spending has accelerated since Sept. 11, with $30 billion
added in supplemental budgets in the last year to pay the costs of
the war on terrorism and $366 billion scheduled to be appropriated in
the coming fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's defense contractors and suppliers are
benefiting from new projects in advanced communications and
intelligence systems. The region's expertise won a significant award
Tuesday, for example, when NASA awarded the contract to develop the
next-generation space telescope to TRW Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Still, employment in aerospace and defense industries, nationally
and in Southern California, has continued to decline because
production of commercial jets at Boeing Co. and Europe's Airbus has
been hard hit by the plight of the airlines in the aftermath of Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial aviation accounts for more industrial jobs than
military aerospace, particularly among Southern California
manufacturers that supply parts to Boeing and Airbus.</TE>
<TE>   Related to defense are expenditures for homeland security, roughly
$38 billion in fiscal 2003, which begins next month. Widespread
security precautions at airports, power plants, water systems and
workplaces already are creating large numbers of jobs for guards,
screeners, security specialists and the like.</TE>
<TE>   Not only the federal government but state and municipal
governments also are contracting for "assessments of how vulnerable
their water systems are and what can be done to make them secure,"
says Diane Creel, president of Earth Tech Inc., a Long Beach-based
water treatment firm.</TE>
<TE>   But expenditures on homeland security, not to mention the delays
due to searches and security checks, impose a cost on the economy.
Money spent on screening passengers, cargoes, water supplies and such
represents resources taken away from more-productive purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, "taxes will have to be raised to pay for those security
efforts," says economist Daniel Mitchell of UCLA. "And because the
war on terrorism will not end with a signing of a surrender
agreement, all of those costs will go on indefinitely."</TE>
<TE>   Of course the reason for greater homeland security is that Sept.
11 showed the United States to be vulnerable to attack. That has
changed American attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   But the nation and the economy are not withdrawing into isolation.
Rather, U.S. commitments are increasing around the world, with new
emphasis on Pakistan and India, Afghanistan and the republics of
Central Asia, Russia and, most of all, the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The commitment is not to war in the Middle East but to rebuilding
and new building after war. A "Marshall Plan" is being urged by
former Sen. George Mitchell, whose forebears came from Lebanon, and
by many businesspeople in Israel and Jordan. The term recalls the
U.S. aid to Germany and Japan after World War II that helped those
countries restart their industries and reform their economies.</TE>
<TE>   Similar moves are being urged to end unrest in the Middle East.
"The people of the Middle East are bright and hard-working," Mitchell
testified to Congress recently. "They don't want a handout; they want
to work."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, after the attacks of Sept. 11 by educated young men from
societies that offered them little but fanaticism, the U.S. has no
choice but to fix the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   As historian Bernard Lewis, author in the last year of "What Went
Wrong? Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response," puts it: "The
U.S. must either get tough or get out"--end its dependence on oil or
put the region right so the U.S. and the world is not living with a
constant threat.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 changed the economy and the world.</TE>

<HD>Genentech Shares Decline on Cancer Drug Setback</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Company says Avastin did not prolong the lives of
breast cancer patients. The stock falls 9.7%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors drove Genentech Inc. shares down 9.7% on Tuesday on news
that a closely watched experimental cancer drug failed to prolong the
lives of patients with advanced breast cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The company disclosed late Monday that Avastin slowed tumor growth
but did not improve the survival of breast cancer patients in
clinical trials, the gold standard for marketing approval.</LD>
<LD>   Avastin was one of the most promising candidates of an emerging
class of drugs that are called angiogenesis inhibitors because they
choke tumors by closing off the blood vessels that feed them. Hailed
as a silver bullet only a few years ago, anti-angiogenesis drugs have
been a big disappointment to investors and drug companies that have
poured millions into their development.</LD>
<TE>   Pharmacia Corp.'s Sugen unit dropped an angiogenesis blocker in
February after it failed in late-stage clinical trials. No such drug
has yet reached the market.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry is still learning how to use these drugs," said
Stephens Inc. analyst Jason Zhang. "It doesn't have a handle on it
yet."</TE>
<TE>   For Genentech, the results mean that Avastin, which is being
tested in other types of cancer, won't reach the market before 2004
and isn't likely to generate the $1 billion in peak sales previously
forecast by some analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The setback heightens the importance of other drugs in Genentech's
development pipeline. Key data on medications for psoriasis and
asthma are expected soon. Whatever the outcome of those drug trials,
it will be tougher for the South San Francisco-based company to meet
its ambitious financial goals. Chief Executive Arthur D. Levinson
pledged in 1999 to achieve average annual earnings growth of 25%
through 2005.</TE>
<TE>   A number of analysts Tuesday reduced their earnings forecasts for
Genentech as they removed Avastin from 2002 and 2003 projections.
Frank DiLorenzo, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., downgraded
the stock to "hold" from "accumulate," expressing reduced confidence
in the drug's "approvability and potential."</TE>
<TE>   Genentech shares closed at $28.89, down $3.11 on the New York
Stock Exchange, on a day when biotechnology stocks edged slightly
higher.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech downplayed the significance of the failed trial and said
that it had always believed Avastin had greater potential in colon
and kidney cancers. Avastin targets a protein that is more prevalent
in those cancers than in breast cancer, said Gwen Fyfe, senior
director for oncology affairs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, she said, patients in the breast cancer trial were
sicker and therefore harder to treat than patients in the colon or
kidney cancer trials.</TE>
<TE>   In one completed clinical trial, she said, colon cancer patients
treated with a combination of Avastin and standard chemotherapy drugs
lived 3.5 months longer than patients on chemotherapy alone. Results
from a larger trial with colon cancer patients should be available
next year, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have much stronger data in colorectal cancer than we had in
breast cancer," Fyfe said.</TE>
<TE>   Avastin is an antibody that works by disrupting one of the protein
switches that spurs blood vessel growth, the vascular endothelial
growth factor, or VEGF. The drug doesn't cause tumors to die but
slows their growth by pruning the thicket of blood vessels that feed
cancerous cells.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, Avastin and other anti-angiogenesis drugs create more
navigable pathways for chemotherapy drugs, which reach tumors through
the bloodstream. How chemotherapy drugs work with Avastin on specific
tumors is as much an art as a science, said analyst Alex Hittle of
A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "The tricky thing is finding the right dose of Avastin that still
allows chemotherapy to get in there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hittle said he did not expect the drug to work well in breast
cancer. For Genentech, success with Avastin in breast cancer would
have allowed it to get the drug to market more quickly and leverage a
sales force that already promotes the successful breast cancer drug
Herceptin.</TE>
<TE>   "For Genentech, it was kind of like having a second down and
inches and throwing a long ball to see if you can get to the end zone
more quickly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Avastin will prove to be an effective treatment for colon and
kidney cancers, Hittle predicted. At a medical meeting in May,
Genentech presented data that showed the drug slowed the advance of
kidney cancer, a significant result for a hard-to-treat disease.</TE>

<HD>A Year Later, Many Sectors Still Struggle but Some Show Big
Gains</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most investors who plunked down money for stocks Sept. 10, 2001--one
day before the terrorist attacks--still are far underwater one year
later, based on the performance of major market indexes since then.</LD>
<LD>   But some stock sectors have scored strong gains since a year ago,
after diving initially with the broad market when trading reopened
Sept. 17.</LD>
<LD>   Within the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, the winners
since Sept. 10 have included such disparate stock sectors as can and
bottle makers, home builders and casino companies.</LD>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 index was down 16.8% from Sept. 10 through Tuesday.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 10.4% in the period and the
Nasdaq composite index was down 22.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Stock trading was suspended for four sessions after the attacks,
and when it resumed Sept. 17, the market suffered heavy selling,
driving nearly all shares lower.</TE>
<TE>   But buyers returned in force the week of Sept. 24 and fueled a
powerful rebound in stocks that carried into January.</TE>
<TE>   The broad market sank again in spring and summer, reaching
five-year lows in midsummer. But one year after the attacks, some
investors who bought just before the attacks are solidly in the
black, if they held on.</TE>
<TE>   Can and bottle makers are the top-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500
since Sept. 10, with a gain of nearly 50%. There are two stocks in
the group: Ball Corp. and Pactiv Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Ball have surged from $28 a year ago to $53.82 Tuesday,
as the firm's earnings have benefited from strong shipments of
plastic bottles to water companies. Ball also is on an expansion
binge: It recently announced plans to buy the No. 2 maker of beverage
cans in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Home builders also have posted powerful gains over the last year,
as the housing market has remained robust. The average stock in the
S&amp;P 500 home-builders index is up nearly 49% since Sept. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Other groups that have risen sharply include managed healthcare
companies, as earnings in that industry have soared; gold miners, as
the metal's price has jumped; and brewers, a classic "defensive"
investment in a tough economy.</TE>
<TE>   One surprise on the list of top-performing sectors is the casino
group. The stocks crumbled after Sept. 11 as many investors feared
that Las Vegas and other gambling sites would suffer from a falloff
in travel. But business has been better than many analysts expected.</TE>
<TE>   On the down side, the biggest losers among S&amp;P 500 sectors since
Sept. 10 are utility firms, technology firms and telecom firms.</TE>
<TE>   Electric and gas utilities have been pummeled in part by the
fallout from Enron Corp.'s collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The telecom sector was in a depression even before the attacks,
and business only got worse afterward for many companies, amid a glut
of supply.</TE>
<TE>   The average wireless services company in the S&amp;P 500 is down 67.5%
from Sept. 10. The average telecom equipment maker has fallen 48.6%.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Chief of HPL Charged With Fraud</HD>
<DH>Courts: He allegedly faked purchases. A civil suit over
nonexistent sales has been settled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KAHN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal authorities Tuesday charged the former chief of HPL
Technologies Inc. with wire fraud for allegedly fabricating customer
orders that represented most of the software maker's sales in the
last fiscal year.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. attorney's office for the northern district of California
alleged in a criminal complaint that Yervant David Lepejian, 41,
repeatedly created fake customer purchase orders then covered up the
fraud by doctoring financial records and forging letters to auditors
verifying the sales.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the
former chairman and chief executive settled civil fraud charges for
allegedly creating more than $28 million in nonexistent sales that
resulted in the San Jose-based company overstating its revenue for
fiscal 2002 by 328%.</LD>
<TE>   Lepejian, who settled the civil charges without admitting or
denying the allegations, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But his lawyer said the former CEO regretted his actions and has
cooperated with the company, the SEC and the U.S. Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Lepejian founded HPL in 1987 and spent 15 years building the
company," said attorney Michael Tubach. "His actions were the result
of a terribly misguided effort to make HPL succeed rather than a
desire for personal profit."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement with the SEC, Lepejian agreed to an
order permanently barring him from serving as an officer or director
of a public company and requiring him to pay an undetermined amount
in fines and penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "This case goes far beyond the sort of 'cooking the books' that
has become all too familiar to today's investors," said Helane
Morrison, the chief of the SEC's San Francisco office.</TE>
<TE>   A representative from HPL could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Jack in the Box Slashes Forecast on Weak Sales</HD>
<DH>Restaurants: The chain also cites costs for closing eight
eateries and settling a lawsuit by employees. Shares tumble 9%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN CHU</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Jack in the Box Inc. on Tuesday halved its quarterly earnings
forecast, citing soft sales as well as charges to close several of
its fast-food restaurants and to settle a lawsuit filed by California
employees.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the San Diego company fell more than 9%, or $2.55, to
$24.65, on the New York Stock Exchange, where they were among the
worst percentage losers.</LD>
<LD>   Jack in the Box, whose restaurants are mainly in the West and
Southwest, said sales at restaurants open at least a year, a key
industry measure, will show a 3% drop for the fourth quarter ending
Sept. 29.</LD>
<TE>   It expects to report a profit of 34 cents a share, down from its
July 31 forecast of 67 cents and from year-earlier earnings of 52
cents.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Robert Nugent said sales were softer than
anticipated because of the weak economy and because the "Our Best
Burgers Ever" marketing campaign failed to ramp up sales as quickly
as expected.</TE>
<TE>   Unveiled July 31, the campaign featured new ingredients,
additional menu items such as Mexican taquitos and revamped food
packaging in an effort to distinguish the chain in the increasingly
cutthroat fast-food market.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon Smith Barney analyst Mark Kalinowski downgraded Jack in
the Box stock from "outperform" to "in-line," saying the same-store
sales figures are weaker than he had expected. Kalinowski cut his
share-price target to $25 from $36.</TE>
<TE>   Jack in the Box said it will cost about $9.5 million, including
legal fees, to settle the 2001 suit in which employees in California
alleged that the company did not properly pay overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Closing of the eight restaurants will cost $6.1 million, Jack in
the Box said, adding that it expects the move to benefit operating
earnings in the next fiscal year and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding the two charges, the company said it expects to report
fourth-quarter earnings of 60 cents, below the average estimate of 67
cents from analysts surveyed by research firm Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Jack in the Box said it has agreed to repurchase interests in 76
restaurant properties that have been encumbered by a 1994 lease
transaction.</TE>
<TE>   In January, it plans to pay off the $70 million of notes used to
finance the leases.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Climb Again Despite Security Alert</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Major indexes end higher for third straight
session ahead of the Sept. 11 anniversary. Gold falls, and the dollar
rises.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks looming,
investors shrugged off a government security alert Tuesday and
cautiously hunted for bargains, pushing major stock indexes to their
first three-day winning streak in a month.</LD>
<LD>   "There are tremendous 'what if' questions regarding Sept. 11, but
the market is beginning to throw off some of its other worries," said
Milton Ezrati, senior economist at Lord Abbett &amp; Co. "We haven't had
a corporate scandal in a while. If nothing happens on Sept. 11 and
the U.S. shows some diplomatic savvy with Iraq, we think a rally is
likely in the next months."</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 83.23 points, or 1%, to
8,602.61. The Nasdaq composite index gained 15.49 points, or 1.2%, to
1,320.09. The benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 6.62 points,
or 0.7%, to 909.58.</LD>
<TE>   The last time both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow gained for three straight
days was Aug. 7-9.</TE>
<TE>   Winners outnumbered losers by about 9 to 7 on Nasdaq and the New
York Stock Exchange. Volume was light--about 25% below the
three-month NYSE average.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe some people are saying, 'Let's wait until after Sept. 11
and when everything goes fine, then we'll start buying again,' " said
Thomas Garcia, head trader at Thornburg Investment Management in
Santa Fe, N.M. "We're not one of them, but I can understand the
nervousness."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. exchanges will delay the opening of trading today until after
a memorial service at the World Trade Center site.</TE>
<TE>   A morning rally lost some power as the government put the nation
on a "high risk" terrorism alert for the first time. Intelligence
officials received credible threats of an attack against U.S.
embassies and military facilities abroad, said Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   And the U.S. Navy warned that Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network,
which carried out the Sept. 11 attacks, may hit oil tankers in the
Persian Gulf and Red Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Indexes began their late rally after President Bush sought to
downplay concerns, saying "we have no specific threat to America."</TE>
<TE>   Investors also are worried the U.S. may take military action
against Iraq, traders said. Bush is to outline his Iraq policy in a
United Nations speech Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   United Technologies climbed $2.08 to $61.21, leading the Dow
higher after the maker of Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines said it will
meet its 2002 earnings target. Wal-Mart Stores, another Dow
component, gained $1.50 to $54.78 and lifted retailers after an
industry report showed sales rose for the week ended Saturday.
Target, which plans to almost double the number of its stores in the
next eight years, added 57 cents to $35.57.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer spending is helping drive the sputtering economic
recovery. Retail same-store sales rose 0.6% for the week ended Sept.
7 from a month ago, according to the Instinet Research Redbook weekly
sales report. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.2% from the
same week a year earlier, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good sign if it holds, but one week doesn't make a
quarter," said Thornburg's Garcia. "If we see several weeks of this,
I could definitely change my mind."</TE>
<TE>   After hitting a seven-week high on Monday, gold fell $3.40 to
$317.90 an ounce in New York as profit-taking speculators cashed in
some winnings. The dollar rose against the euro and the yen.</TE>
<TE>   But Treasury yields, which rose Friday and Monday on improving
economic news, slid as investors sought safety in government
securities. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to
4.00% from 4.06% on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Semiconductor shares advanced after Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing reported an increase in August sales. The SOX index of
chip stocks climbed 3.6%. Novellus Systems added $1.22 to $24.88;
Intel rose 39 cents to $16.47; and Advanced Micro Devices gained 30
cents to $8.27.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial shares were the biggest drag on the S&amp;P 500 after
Astoria Financial said home refinancing is biting into profit. Fannie
Mae, the biggest buyer of mortgages, and Washington Mutual, the
biggest mortgage lender, had the largest losses in the S&amp;P 500.
Astoria Financial plunged $3.90, or 12%, to $29.05. Fannie Mae lost
$1.57 to $75.15, while Washington Mutual shed $1.45 to $36.90. Bank
of America, the third-biggest U.S. bank, dropped 72 cents to $68.53.</TE>
<TE>   * JetBlue Airways rose $3.98 to $43.76 after the low-fare carrier
suspended plans for a secondary offering because major shareholders
didn't express interest in selling their shares. JetBlue is up 62%
since its initial public offering on April 11.</TE>
<TE>   * In overseas trading, European markets rallied. Key stock indexes
climbed 2.8% in Britain, 3.1% in France and 1.9% in Germany.</TE>

<HD>Criminal Probe of Stewart Sought</HD>
<DH>Media: House leaders ask Justice Department to investigate
whether the homemaking celebrity misled them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr. and ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>House leaders on Tuesday asked the Justice Department to launch a
criminal probe of homemaking celebrity Martha Stewart, saying she may
have misled investigators about her sale of a biotech stock.</LD>
<LD>   The House Energy and Commerce Committee has been investigating
whether Stewart, a former stockbroker who is now chief executive of
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., relied on inside information
when she sold nearly 4,000 shares of ImClone Systems Inc. a day
before the company disclosed that its cancer drug, Erbitux, had been
rejected by the Food and Drug Administration.</LD>
<LD>   House Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) said
Stewart's phone records and other information obtained by committee
investigators indicate she may have given the committee false details
about the Dec. 27 stock transaction, which netted her $229,522.</LD>
<TE>   In an eight-page letter to Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, Tauzin and
Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the House investigations
subcommittee, urged the Justice Department to determine whether
Stewart provided false details to Congress, which would be a federal
crime.</TE>
<TE>   The letter, also signed by the ranking Democrats on Tauzin's and
Greenwood's committees, cited the federal False Statements Act, which
makes it a felony for anyone to "knowingly and willfully make any
material false statement" in an investigation by Congress. Violators
can be fined and imprisoned for up to five years.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's Washington lawyer, James F. Fitzpatrick, declined to
comment. But another Stewart lawyer, Robert Morvillo, said in a
prepared statement he is glad the probe will be handled by Justice
Department officials. He praised them as "professional
law-enforcement authorities who are trained to conduct a responsible
and thorough investigation. I'm glad that the political aspects of
this matter will now terminate and am confident that the
investigation will lead to Ms. Stewart's exoneration."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has not been charged with a crime and has said she did not
engage in any illegal activity.</TE>
<TE>   The House committee had considered issuing a subpoena to force
Stewart to testify, but backed down after her attorneys insisted that
she would invoke her constitutional right not to testify.</TE>
<TE>   News that the House committee would refer the matter to the
Justice Department--and not subject Stewart to a potentially
embarrassing appearance before Congress--sent shares of Martha
Stewart Living Omnimedia up $1.30 to $9.05 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time people are waiting for news and you get the news, it
tends to be a release of anxiety," said Jeffrey Klinefelter, an
analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. "That seems
to be what's going on now."</TE>
<TE>   Although up from last month's 52-week low of $6.29, the stock's
closing price was still well off a March high of $20.93.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations to secure Stewart's appearance before the House panel
continued right up to shortly before Tauzin and Greenwood's news
conference. But in the end, Stewart declined to cooperate, although
her lawyers have turned over more than 1,000 pages of documents.</TE>
<TE>   "Martha Stewart would not either voluntarily be interviewed nor
would she testify before this committee.... We're at the end of the
road," Tauzin said. "Faced with the inconsistencies ... it's a matter
for the Justice Department."</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin released records Tuesday that appear to contradict earlier
statements from Stewart's lawyers that her ImClone shares were to be
sold automatically if they fell below $60 a share.</TE>
<TE>   According to phone records, Stewart's broker, Douglas Faneuil,
called Stewart or her employee at least once on the morning of Dec.
27, while ImClone's shares were still trading above $60 a share,
Tauzin said. At least one call from a Stewart phone was placed to
Faneuil before he entered a sell order for 3,928 shares at 1:43 p.m.,
according to records released by the committee.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin also released an e-mail from Stewart to her stockbroker
that same day suggesting that she anticipated significant
developments about ImClone on Dec. 27.</TE>
<TE>   "Has news come out yet? Let me know," Stewart wrote in an e-mail
sent at 1:18 p.m. on Dec. 27.</TE>
<TE>   The rare but not unprecedented request to the Justice Department
reflects Congress' increasing frustration in securing the testimony
or cooperation of witnesses amid a growing wave of corporate
financial scandals. Since the beginning of this year, lawmakers have
sought the testimony of corporate executives from Fortune 500
companies, including those from Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and Global
Crossing Ltd., only to have many of them refuse to testify or
cooperate in the investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "Formal committee referrals of possible false statement charges
are quite infrequent and the Justice Department investigates them
very seriously," said Charles Tiefer, a University of Baltimore law
professor who is former deputy general counsel of the House of
Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee referral reflects the double frustration that
Congress can't seem to get the full story from the corporate
officials in the current scandals and that Martha Stewart went so far
as to provide the committee an account which they consider likely
untrue," Tiefer added.</TE>
<TE>   Since the committee began its probe of the trading of ImClone
shares as its cancer treatment drug was facing FDA review, Stewart
has found herself at the center of the biggest insider-trading
scandal since the takeover frenzy of the 1980s, led by disgraced Wall
Street trader Ivan Boesky</TE>
<TE>   Subcommittee Chairman Greenwood said Justice Department officials
have indicated they will seriously examine the evidence forwarded by
panel investigators.</TE>
<TE>   The lawmakers said they have been prevented from reconciling
"discrepancies, ambiguities and suspicious communications"
surrounding the stock sale because Stewart has repeatedly refused to
be interviewed by committee staff.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to phone records and e-mails between Stewart and
stockbroker Faneuil, the committee released the message log of
ImClone founder Samuel D. Waksal, who is a friend of Stewart's and
was indicted by a federal grand jury last month on charges of insider
trading, obstruction of justice and perjury. The log shows a notation
of Stewart's phone number in Mexico from Dec. 27 to Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Some business experts speculate that Stewart and her company are
likely to get some reprieve in the coming weeks, although it is
unclear how the public and Wall Street will react over the long term.
While the Justice Department weighs the lawmakers' request for a
probe of Stewart's allegedly false statements, the Securities and
Exchange Commission continues its investigation of possible insider
trading.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the committee's action prolongs the examination of
Stewart's conduct at a time when the public is taking a critical view
of those who are alleged to have engaged in corporate wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a continual drain on her image because it is not resolved
in any positive way," said Michael Kamins, an associate professor of
marketing at USC's business school and an expert in celebrity
marketing. "So it sits there and consumers continue to think about
and link her to this issue of wrongdoing. She is not cleared and the
perception is that if she was honest, she would have been cleared."</TE>
<TE>   But for most consumers, the corporate figurehead's travails are
irrelevant at the checkout counter, said Kurt Barnard, president of
Barnard's Retail Consulting Group.</TE>
<TE>   "Wall Street is predisposed to be very worried and I don't blame
them," Barnard said. "But that has very little to do with the sale of
a pink pillowcase at Kmart or a gallon of paint at Sears."</TE>
<TE>   Goldman reported from Los Angeles.</TE>

<CX>   Martha Stewart--A story in the Business section on Wednesday
incorrectly said Martha Stewart sent a Dec. 27 e-mail inquiring about
news on ImClone Systems Inc., in which she held stock. The e-mail was
sent by Douglas Faneuil, who was described incorrectly as Stewart's
broker but in fact was the broker's assistant.</CX>

<HD>Oil Prices Dip in After-Hours Trading Amid Growing Supply</HD>
<DH>Energy: Report of bigger heating oil and gasoline
inventories eases concerns early in trading session over possible
terrorism or U.S. attacks against Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>U.S. oil prices softened late Tuesday as a new report showing a hefty
supply buffer of domestic gasoline and heating oil eased market
worries over a terror threat against oil tankers in the Mideast.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. heating oil supplies, which are becoming a market focus ahead
of the winter heating season, rose 2.7 million barrels in the week
ended Friday, while gasoline inventories rose 66,000 barrels,
according to the weekly American Petroleum Institute report.</LD>
<LD>   Crude oil inventories were lower, but by a moderate 470,000
barrels.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. and European oil prices had surged earlier in the day to near
19-month highs amid a warning from the U.S. Navy of potential Al
Qaeda terrorist attacks on ships in the Gulf in the Middle East, as
well as amid heightened concern that looming U.S. military action
against Iraq could disrupt oil supplies from the region.</TE>
<TE>   But near-term crude oil futures closed unchanged in New York at
$29.73 a barrel after rising as high as $30.20.</TE>
<TE>   And after regular trading ended, crude prices dipped slightly in
after-hours activity, to $29.65, following the API inventory data.</TE>
<TE>   Both gasoline and heating-oil inventories have climbed to more
than 11 million barrels above their levels of a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. inventories of gasoline stand at 206.5 million barrels, up
from 194.6 million a year ago; heating oil inventories are at 134
million barrels, up from 121 million.</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil inventories, however, at 298.4 million barrels last
week, are down from 304.9 million barrels a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The International Energy Agency, which defends energy security for
the industrialized world, has said it expects the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries to act on output after the recent surge
in crude prices from $26.50 a barrel in late July.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts believe that major producer Saudi Arabia wants to
increase production to prevent a possible supply crunch this winter.</TE>
<TE>   But Kuwait said Monday that it would not support an output
increase unless prices have a sustained run above the $28-a-barrel
top end of OPEC's targeted price range for a basket of cartel crudes.
The basket was at $27.59 a barrel Monday.</TE>

<HD>Tropicana's Patent on Juice Blend Technology Is Rejected</HD>
<DH>Food: The producer's practice of mixing orange varieties is
not exclusive to the firm, U.S. ruling says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The world's biggest maker of chilled orange juice, PepsiCo Inc.'s
Tropicana Products, has been dealt a setback by a U.S. Patent office
ruling that technology used to blend several types of oranges is not
exclusive to the company.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office said it rejected a November
2000 patent awarded to Tropicana that allowed the juice producer to
blend four special orange varieties when making its Tropicana Pure
Premium juice.</LD>
<LD>   Florida Citrus Mutual, which challenged Tropicana's right to the
patent, said the juice producer's practice of blending orange
varieties was already common in the juice industry.</LD>
<TE>   Tropicana said the patent ruling was expected and the company will
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   If it is forced to relinquish its patent, any orange grower would
be able to raise the four special orange varieties and sell them to
competitors such as Coca-Cola Co.'s Minute Maid brand. The current
patent allows growers to sell to only one juice producer, Tropicana.</TE>
<TE>   Early research to develop the special oranges was funded by local
growers and the University of Florida. Tropicana said the research
focused on developing table fruit, not as a special juice blend,
which the company said it financed.</TE>
<TE>   The federal patent office said Tropicana will continue to hold the
patent during the appeals process.</TE>
<TE>   "The patent remains valid, if they go the whole route, until one
or more of the claims are invalidated," said Bridget Quinn,
spokeswoman for the patent office.</TE>
<TE>   The special variety of oranges, which were brought to Florida from
Brazil in the early 1900s, have characteristics similar to Valencia
oranges, which have a sweeter taste and a more vibrant color.</TE>
<TE>   The special varieties also ripen earlier in the season, between
September and December.</TE>
<TE>   In order to maintain flavor, other juice producers currently store
Valencia fruits from the past growing season and blend them with less
flavorful early-season oranges.</TE>
<TE>   The right to blend the four varieties of oranges is a major coup
for Tropicana in the not-from-concentrate juice industry, the fastest
growing segment of the orange juice market.</TE>
<TE>   In dollars, Tropicana estimated it holds 34% of the chilled orange
juice market, which includes both concentrate and
not-from-concentrate products.</TE>

<HD>Qwest Pulls Long-Distance Bids for 9 States</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Company says it plans to refile the applications
after addressing questions about its accounting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEREMY PELOFSKY</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. said Tuesday that it withdrew
its bids to offer long-distance telephone and data service in nine
states because of problems with its accounting methods.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which recently said it would restate results for 1999
to 2001 after misreporting $1.6 billion in sales, has to prove to the
Federal Communications Commission that its local telephone networks
in the states are open to competition to begin offering the
long-distance services.</LD>
<LD>   "While we are going to clean up this technical issue, it has no
effect on what we have done to open up to competition," said Steve
Davis, Qwest senior vice president of policy and law. "We'll correct
the situation and refile within a few weeks."</LD>
<TE>   The FCC was scheduled to rule today on the application covering
Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska and North Dakota and on Oct. 10 for
Montana, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. The Denver-based company said
it plans to refile the applications by the end of the month and then
for three other states--New Mexico, Oregon and South Dakota--in
October.</TE>
<TE>   The company previously offered the services in 14 states but had
to exit that business line after acquiring local telephone firm US
West in 2000 until it had proved to federal regulators that its
networks there are open to competition.</TE>
<TE>   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 bars dominant local telephone
carriers from providing long-distance voice and data services until
they give rivals access to the network of wires that connect homes
and businesses as well as databases for entering new orders.</TE>
<TE>   The law also requires the company's books to conform to generally
accepted accounting principles, but because Qwest is restating its
results, the panel was poised to reject the applications.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite extensive examination of the record supporting these
applications, questions remain regarding whether Qwest has complied
with the safeguards set forth by Congress," FCC Chairman Michael K.
Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest is the only regional Bell operating company of the four big
carriers that has yet to win approval to offer long-distance
telephone service in any of its home territory. Verizon
Communications Inc. has won approval for eight states, SBC
Communications Inc. has received permission for long-distance
services in five states, and BellSouth Corp. has approval in two
states.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Qwest fell 13 cents to $3.04 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Executive of Rite Aid Assisted Prosecutors in Building
Fraud Case</HD>
<DH>Retailing: Timothy Noonan agreed to record sessions with
former chief executive and chief counsel. Defendants seek to have
tapes banned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former president of Rite Aid Corp. made secret recordings for
prosecutors of two top executives now under indictment for accounting
fraud at the nation's third-largest drugstore chain, court records
show.</LD>
<LD>   On six occasions last year, Timothy Noonan taped former Chief
Executive Martin Grass and former Chief Counsel Franklin Brown
discussing the investigation of Rite Aid, records show. Grass, Brown
and ex-Chief Financial Officer Frank Bergonzi were indicted June 21
on charges of orchestrating a fraud that forced Rite Aid to restate
$1.6 billion in profit.</LD>
<LD>   A federal grand jury also accused Grass and Brown of conspiring to
obstruct justice. The government's case rests in part on tapes Noonan
made one year after he resigned in February 2000. He pleaded guilty
July 10 to charges he concealed the fraud from Rite Aid internal
investigators.</LD>
<TE>   Noonan agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in a bid for leniency
at sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   "The government's obstruction case will rest substantially on
certain tapes that the government made of conversations between a
government informant, former Rite Aid officer Timothy Noonan and
defendants Brown and Grass," Brown's attorney, Reid Weingarten, said
in court papers in Harrisburg, Pa., last week.</TE>
<TE>   Grass and Brown have asked a judge to bar use of the tapes,
claiming that Assistant U.S. Atty. Kim Daniel violated Pennsylvania
ethics rules in directing Noonan to make them. The executives claim
that Daniel knew the defendants had retained attorneys in March 2001
who forbade them from discussing the case, and that the prosecutor
used Noonan to surreptitiously conduct interviews.</TE>
<TE>   During these sessions, "Noonan repeatedly steered the conversation
to issues the government was interested in," Brown and Grass argued.
"In each of these instances Noonan, acting as AUSA Daniel's
surrogate, was actively interviewing Brown and Grass about issues
under investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel didn't return calls seeking comment. Noonan attorney David
Howard wouldn't say when his client began cooperating.</TE>
<TE>   "His cooperation was extensive," Howard said. He also said he
hadn't seen the court papers submitted by defense attorneys and
couldn't comment on them.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that company profit, which helped boost share
price by 306% from 1995 through 1999, was a "mirage" fabricated by
top Rite Aid officers who overstated income and understated expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors claim that the Rite Aid executives lied about company
finances to the Securities and Exchange Commission, bank lenders,
former auditor KPMG and a law firm hired by Rite Aid's audit
committee in December 1999 to investigate fraud allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Grass also is accused of hiding his transfer of $2.6 million in
Rite Aid money to a real estate company he owned with his
brother-in-law to buy 83 acres in Fairview Township, Pa. A vice
president, Eric Sorkin, was charged with lying to a grand jury and
conspiring to obstruct justice.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC, which called the case one of the most egregious
accounting frauds ever, filed a civil suit against Grass, Bergonzi
and Brown. The commission also settled separate cases against Rite
Aid and Noonan.</TE>
<TE>   Although the indictment refers only to recorded conversations
without naming the informant, court papers filed by defense attorneys
specifically said that Noonan helped make the tapes. Noonan, 60, was
a corporate officer for nearly three decades who rose to chief
operating officer and president.</TE>
<TE>   He was one of Rite Aid's four top officers, along with Grass,
Brown and Bergonzi.</TE>
<TE>   Noonan taped Brown alone five times from March 13, 2001, to May
21, 2001, records show. He once taped Brown and Grass, whose father,
Alex Grass, founded the company in 1962. At one session, Brown
pledged "his life, his trust, and his sacred honor" to Noonan,
unaware of his colleague's role as an undercover informant, records
show.</TE>
<TE>   Brown and Grass also discussed with Noonan backdated severance
agreements they wanted to hide from prosecutors, the indictment
alleges. Grass allegedly told Noonan that investigators "do not have
and never will have" the computer used to generate the severance
agreements, "unless they use a Trident submarine."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors gave defense attorneys copies of the tapes as part of
the pretrial exchange of evidence. Lawyers for the defendants filed
transcripts of the tapes under seal with U.S. District Judge Yvette
Kane, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Camp Hill, Pa.-based Rite Aid rose 9 cents to $2.34
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Bridgestone / Firestone Americas Holding Inc. recalled 19,700
tires in two separate actions, one because a piece of the tread may
fall off and the other because of incorrect pressure markings.</LD>
<TE>   The larger recall involves possible tread problems on 18,912
Firestone FR690 tires made over four days beginning April 12 in
Wilson, N.C., said spokeswoman Christine Karbowiak. The second recall
involves 754 Widetrack Baja A/T tires made over three weeks beginning
Sept. 23 in LaVergne, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   The unit of Japan's Bridge- stone Corp. recalled millions of
Firestone Wilderness AT tires two years ago as the government
investigated fatal crashes linked to tire-tread separations.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no accidents or injuries related to tires in the
latest recalls, Karbowiak said, adding that the recall is the first
for the Widetrack Baja. The Firestone FR690s may have been used on
Toyota Motor Corp.'s 2003 model Corolla S and LE compact cars built
from mid-April through early September, she said. Those tires are
size P195/65R15.</TE>

<LD>   General Dynamics Corp.'s Gulfstream unit, one of the biggest
makers of corporate jets, won an order valued at as much as $1.5
billion from NetJets Inc. for as many as 100 of its G150 jets.</LD>
<TE>   NetJets, owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., agreed
to buy 50 of the six-seat jets and took the option to buy another 50,
Gulfstream said. NetJets sells fractional ownerships of small jets to
corporations and wealthy individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Gulfstream and rivals such as Bombardier Inc., maker of the
Learjet, are counting on new models to revive flagging sales in a
slumping economy.</TE>

<LD>   U.S. shopping malls got a little fuller during the first week of
September, giving retailers hope that a summer sales lull was behind
them, two reports showed.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of the
nation's economic activity, snapped up discounted back-to-school
clothes and stationery, as retailers--especially department
stores--tried to forget a bleak month of August.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at U.S. chain stores rose 0.6% in the first week of
September compared with the same period last month, Instinet
Research's Redbook report said.</TE>
<TE>   A separate measure of chain store performance, published jointly
by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS Warburg, showed a milder 0.1%
sales gain after a 0.5% increase a week earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Sales rose a meager 2.3% compared with the same week last year,
according to BTM, down from a peak of 4.5% touched in July.</TE>

<LD>   Media giant AOL Time Warner Inc. left the door open to making a
move on British entertainment companies, saying it was interested in
British broadcasters and had not given up hope on music rival EMI
Group.</LD>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons said Europe remained a
long-term growth engine for the world's biggest media company and
Britain represented a crucial springboard, but he signaled he would
not be rushing to forge deals at current prices.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner is reviewing its strategic direction as it faces
mounting problems including a faltering Internet unit that was once
its flagship business. The group also is grappling with accounting
probes, but Parsons said an internal online investigation would not
extend to other divisions.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner shares, which have fallen 60% this year, were up 3
cents to $13.36 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>   ImClone Systems Inc. may be the subject of additional hearings by
the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Chairman W. J. "Billy"
Tauzin (R-La.) said.</LD>
<TE>   The committee is examining ImClone's handling of its Erbitux
cancer-drug application, which the Food and Drug Administration
rejected in December. The rejection triggered an 86% drop in shares
and a probe into whether the company misled investors.</TE>
<TE>   Further probes will focus on what went wrong with Erbitux, and
ways to improve the FDA's review process, Tauzin said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based ImClone rose 20 cents to $8.20 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>   General Motors Corp., the world's biggest auto maker, recalled
about 280,000 Cadillac DeVille sedans from the 2000 to 2002 model
years to fix seat belts that might not stay locked in a crash.</LD>
<TE>   The auto maker told the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration that front lap or shoulder belt retractors may fail
when the car slows more than 21 mph before a crash. No problems or
injuries have been reported by owners, after failures were noted in
crash tests as early as November 2000.</TE>

<HD>Skechers Lowers Its Outlook for Second Half</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid disappointing shoe sales, Skechers USA Inc. warned Tuesday that
earnings probably won't meet analysts expectations in the second half
of the year, prompting investors to shave almost 16% off the value of
the company's stock.</LD>
<LD>   The share price, now about 48% lower than it was a year ago, had
been dropping since Friday when two brokerage firms lowered their
ratings on the Manhattan Beach-based shoe designer. The stock closed
Tuesday at $10.25, down $1.93 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   It was the lowest closing price since April 25, 2000, when the
stock finished trading at $9. More than 4.2 million shares changed
hands Tuesday, almost 10 times the average daily number of shares
traded over the last three months.</LD>
<TE>   "When the news came out today, it was worse than people were
anticipating," said John Zolidis, an analyst with Buckingham Research
Group, one of the firms that issued a lower rating on the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Skechers is one of a number of companies with diminished hopes
after a weak back-to-school shopping season, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of [retailers] were pinning their hopes on this big
second-half recovery," said Rozilyn Bryant, an analyst with
Morningstar Inc. "You find a lot of these retail-associated companies
are tempering their expectations slowly but surely."</TE>
<TE>   Skechers said in a statement that it expects weakness in U.S.
retail sales to continue into the holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   For the third quarter ending Sept. 30, the company said it now
anticipates earnings of 30 cents to 35 cents a share. A consensus of
analysts from Thomson First Call was expecting profit of 41 cents a
share. Sales for the quarter should be $245 million to $255 million,
compared with $287.9 million in the third quarter of last year.</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth quarter, Skechers anticipates earnings of 10 cents
to 14 cents a share, well below the 26 cents First Call analysts were
expecting. In the fourth quarter of last year, Skechers had earnings
of 5 cents a share on sales of $214.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   For the year, the company said per share earnings should be $1.45
to $1.54, compared with $1.24 last year. First Call analysts were
expecting earnings for 2002 of $1.71. Sales for 2002 should range
from $961 million to $971 million, compared with $960.4 million in
2001.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>BCE Inc., Canada's biggest telecommunications company, may sell its
phone-book unit to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. for about $1.8
billion, people familiar with the matter said.</LD>
<LD>   Executives from the world's biggest buyout firm are meeting with
BCE's management in Montreal this week to try to reach an agreement,
the people said. Montreal-based BCE is among a handful of
telecommunications companies, including Qwest Communications
International Inc., selling phone-book units. Although some of the
sales are to repay debt, BCE needs cash to help pay for a 20% stake
in Bell Canada, which BCE agreed in June to buy back from SBC
Communications Inc. for $4.02 billion.</LD>

<HD>Nokia Earnings to Meet Target but Not Sales</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nokia, the world's largest cell phone maker, said that its
third-quarter earnings were on target but warned that sales may be
slightly below earlier predictions as improved handset sales failed
to offset a sluggish networks market.</LD>
<LD>   Nokia said earnings per share in the quarter ending Sept. 30 will
be "at the upper end of the earlier indicated range" of 15 cents to
16 cents.</LD>
<LD>   But it said net sales would be from $6.95 billion to $7.25
billion, instead of from $7 billion to $7.4 billion as it had
previously forecast.</LD>
<TE>   In line with earlier forecasts, Nokia said its handset sales will
grow by 4% to 9% in the third quarter from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   It also said it was confident that total global mobile phone sales
will reach 400 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   In the mobile phone sector, which provides it with some 80% of its
revenue, Nokia cited a "strong overall demand pickup," especially in
Europe, during July and August. This would boost the full year
result, and it predicted operating margins at or above 20%.</TE>
<TE>   However, it cautioned that mobile network operations were still
facing hard times and said third-quarter sales in that business would
fall by 5% from the same period in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Nokia's American depositary receipts fell 31 cents to $13.87 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. is in talks to acquire Rare Ltd., a game development
studio that is 49% owned by Nintendo Co., according to sources close
to the negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   A sale would be a coup for Microsoft, which launched its Xbox game
console last year and is aggressively seeking premium titles for the
box.</LD>
<LD>   Rare, based in Britain, has developed a reputation as a top-tier
developer for Nintendo. The privately owned company developed hit
games such as "Donkey Kong Country," "Goldeneye," "Perfect Dark" and
"Banjo Kazooie." It also developed "Starfox Adventures," scheduled
for release Sept. 26 for Nintendo's GameCube console.</LD>
<TE>   Both Nintendo and Microsoft declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Nintendo purchased a 25% stake in Rare and has increased
its stake to 49%. The remainder is owned by brothers Tim and Chris
Stamper, who founded the company in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Nintendo has placed an emphasis on attracting
older audiences for its games, aligning itself with Japanese
developers as Sega Corp., Namco Ltd., Square Soft Inc. and Capcom Co.
Ltd.--studios known for developing more mature titles.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said it had shrunk key elements of the
semiconductor, a development that could lead to a chip with 1 billion
transistors.</LD>
<LD>   Transistors are the tiny switches that are the basic element of a
microprocessor and, when they are flipped on and off in a blindingly
rapid series of sequences, give a chip its computational power.
Microprocessors are the brains that run personal computers.</LD>
<LD>   AMD, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said that it had manufactured the
smallest double-gate transistors to date using industry-standard
technology. The gate of the transistor, across which electrical
current flows to turn the switch on, measures 10 nanometers, or 10
billionths of a meter.</LD>
<TE>   AMD, the chief rival to No. 1 Intel Corp. in the market for
microprocessors, said that the tiny double-gate transistors could
mean that a chip that now holds 100 million transistors could hold
about a billion of the tiny transistors.</TE>
<TE>   A double-gate transistor effectively doubles the electrical
current that can be passed through it.</TE>

<HD>United Bankruptcy Case Would Have Wide Effect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unthinkable a year ago, a Chapter 11 filing now is a real prospect
for United Airlines. So what might happen if the giant carrier does
indeed land in Bankruptcy Court?</LD>
<LD>   The airline will keep flying, but Chapter 11 is a treacherous,
unpredictable process in which creditors and the bankruptcy judge can
impose huge changes. Yet it's almost certain that United would emerge
from bankruptcy a smaller airline, which would have ripple effects
for air travel nationwide, many analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, some believe a leaner United could become more
competitive--and force other airlines to take additional cost-cutting
measures that might improve the overall health of the loss-ridden
industry.</LD>
<TE>   United faces a severe cash crunch because of its high operating
costs, inroads by low-fare rivals and the general slump in air
travel, which took root before last Sept. 11 but was exacerbated by
the terrorist attacks that involved two hijacked United jetliners.</TE>
<TE>   Even as it holds somber anniversary memorials today for its lost
crew and passengers, United is racing to secure wage concessions from
its powerful unions, which along with United's other employees own
55% of the stock of United's holding company, UAL Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The effort is being led by UAL's new chief executive, Glenn
Tilton. His predecessor, Jack Creighton, last month threatened to put
the airline into Chapter 11 proceedings if the concessions weren't
forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   But Tilton still hopes to quickly get the wage cuts to stem
United's losses, and to win a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee so
the airline can raise more cash from the financial markets.</TE>
<TE>   "We're focused right now on recovery," said United spokesman Chris
Brathwaite. But without the cost cuts, he said, "we might be in a
position where we have no choice but to file."</TE>
<TE>   And some analysts note the long-standing animosity between
United's unions and management and contend United is running out of
time. They see United joining US Airways Group Inc. and seeking
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, probably this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Chapter 11 would allow United to keep operating while it works out
a reorganization plan with committees of United's creditors and its
stockholders, under the guidance of a bankruptcy judge. In the
meantime, its pre-Chapter 11 debts would be frozen and creditors
couldn't immediately seize its assets to satisfy their claims.</TE>
<TE>   Several airlines have filed for Chapter 11 since the airlines were
deregulated in 1978; a few have emerged to stay in business, but most
didn't. The two main survivors today are Continental Airlines Inc.
and America West.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you let go of the end of the rope by filing, you never quite
know if you're going to be able to grab it back," said Jonathan
Rosenthal, a partner and bankruptcy specialist at the Santa Monica
investment firm Saybrook Capital.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing you can be sure of is that United has been planning the
bankruptcy filing for many months," in which it's "speculated about
every possible outcome," Rosenthal said. And yet "it's a mistake to
speculate about what the reorganized [company] might look like.
Anything can happen."</TE>
<TE>   A United bankruptcy filing also would have far-reaching effects.
Based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., United is the nation's
second-largest airline behind AMR Corp.'s American, and it handles
about 17% of all domestic airline passengers each day. United has
84,000 employees; makes 1,900 daily flights worldwide with 560
airplanes; and operates major hubs in Chicago, Denver, San Francisco
and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   United's situation recalls Eastern Air Lines' crisis in the 1980s.
With Eastern fast running out of cash, its CEO--former astronaut
Frank Borman--demanded deep wage cuts from workers, who also owned a
big chunk of the carrier's stock.</TE>
<TE>   The workers, feeling they had sacrificed enough, refused, so
Borman threatened to put the airline into Chapter 11. He sold Eastern
instead. But in 1989, after its mechanics went on strike, Eastern did
file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and less than a year later was
grounded forever.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its problems, United is stronger than was Eastern. But
entering Chapter 11 probably would bring huge changes.</TE>
<TE>   Its already battered stock could become worthless, because
United's lenders, suppliers and other creditors get first crack at
its assets. Usually, there aren't enough assets left over for
shareholders. That event would then dilute the voice of the unions
for United's pilots and mechanics, which each have seats on UAL's
board because of their workers' ownership of UAL stock.</TE>
<TE>   UAL's stock dropped 16 cents, or 6%, to $2.58 on Tuesday on the
New York Stock Exchange. UAL's entire market value now is a paltry
$156 million.</TE>
<TE>   The creditors also might press to scuttle the unions' existing
contracts to free up more cash for the creditors' claims. Planes and
airport slots could be sold for the same reason. So could some of
United's global-reaching routes.</TE>
<TE>   Some top executives also might flee to find more secure work
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "The tool bag that the bankruptcy code gives companies is the
ability to jettison unproductive assets," said Martin Zohn, a
bankruptcy lawyer with the firm Proskauer Rose in Los Angeles. "A
bankruptcy allows you to pare down the company to the profitable, to
allow it to attract new investors, and that's the key."</TE>
<TE>   Paring United's schedule would mean fewer choices for passengers,
though United probably would retain its frequent-flier mileage
program. Airports and their municipalities also could feel the effect
of less revenue from taxes and landing fees. United is the biggest
operator at Los Angeles International Airport, with about 20% of the
airport's traffic.</TE>
<TE>   A smaller United also would send ripples across several
industries, reducing prospects for aircraft manufacturers and their
parts suppliers, food-service firms, travel agencies and jet-fuel
providers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a United bankruptcy also would help the industry despite
causing pain for United's workers and others, some argue. United's
size and labor expenses would be pared to better match today's travel
market, making United more competitive with thriving lower-cost,
low-fare carriers such as Southwest Airlines Co., they say.</TE>
<TE>   A reorganized United also could force other big network carriers,
such as American, to retrench further to stay competitive with
United. With their costs more in line with revenues, the airlines
could start making money again.</TE>
<TE>   UAL is currently solvent; its main problem is debt payments of
about $1 billion that are looming in the coming months, which the
airline fears will reduce its cash position to an unbearably low
level.</TE>
<TE>   And United and its unions still hope to avoid Bankruptcy Court by
agreeing among themselves on a concessions package, perhaps within
the next week or two. Creighton, the interim CEO who was succeeded by
Tilton on Labor Day, had given both sides until Monday to strike a
deal that would preclude that step.</TE>
<TE>   Although the deadline still is in effect, United's pilots union
says the company is prepared to extend it.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>French regulators have reportedly obtained documents showing that
former executives at Vivendi Universal tried to pressure its auditors
to adopt accounting changes that would have overstated the company's
annual profit.</LD>
<LD>   The records, which include letters and e-mails, allegedly show
that former Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier and former
Chief Financial Officer Guillaume Hannezo brought heavy pressure on
Vivendi's French auditor to accept the way its American auditor,
Arthur Andersen, had accounted for the sale of shares Vivendi held in
the pay television service British Sky Broadcasting Group.</LD>
<LD>   French regulators later rejected the accounting proposal, which
allegedly would have inflated Vivendi's profit by $1.4 billion.</LD>
<TE>   French securities regulators seized the documents as part of an
investigation that began in July into Vivendi's financial disclosures
since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi executives declined to comment on the documents, which
were published Tuesday in the French newspaper Le Monde. "We're fully
cooperating with the inquiry," Vivendi spokeswoman Anita Larsen said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Long known for its inexpensive jug wines, E&amp;J Gallo Winery has
acquired Louis M. Martini Winery, one of California's oldest
vintners.</LD>
<LD>   The acquisition of Martini gives Gallo 680 plantable acres of
prime vineyards in Napa and Sonoma counties and a label popular for
its middle-market varietals.</LD>
<LD>   The purchase, announced Monday, is part of a continuing
consolidation in the state's wine industry caused by over-planting
and sluggish sales, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Gallo, which has a fine-wine division, was especially interested
in adding Martini's prime Napa acreage to its holdings, said Caroline
Coleman Bailey, spokeswoman for the company and a granddaughter of
Julio Gallo.</TE>
<TE>   Martini, based in St. Helena, and Modesto-based Gallo are private
family-owned companies and did not announce terms of the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Martini is a mid-size winery, producing 130,000 to 150,000 cases
annually, but it is tiny compared with Gallo, which makes 60 million
cases a year and is the world's largest wine company.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Martini, granddaughter of company founder Louis M.
Martini, said her family's business was under pressure from a series
of developments that has created fierce competition within the wine
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Imports from fast-growing wine regions in South America and
Australia are flooding the market with inexpensive quality wine.
California growers have vastly over-planted and produce 52% more
grapes than seven years ago. Getting shelf space at supermarkets and
at other merchants has become difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to look at how hard it is for small companies like ours
to compete with the product coming in from all over the world and to
get distribution," Martini said. "We knew we had to do something."</TE>
<TE>   Martini said the five family shareholders agreed on the deal and
were comfortable with the Gallos, who have known the Martinis for
several generations.</TE>
<TE>   Gallo plans to run the winery as an autonomous unit, she said.
Martini will remain chief executive. Her brother, Michael Martini, a
graduate of UC Davis' enology program, will stay on as winemaker.</TE>
<TE>   The Martini family is keeping 50 acres of vineyards, which it
might use to make a new brand.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Leedom, an analyst with Wells Fargo Securities in San Diego,
expects to see more consolidation in California's depressed wine
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just the tip of the iceberg," Leedom said.</TE>
<TE>   There are about eight large wine concerns besides Gallo that are
on the hunt for California properties, he said.</TE>
<TE>   They include British beverage giant Allied Domecq, which owns the
Clos du Bois, Buena Vista, Callaway and Mumm Cuvee Napa brands.</TE>
<TE>   Beringer Blass Wine Estates, a unit of beverage giant Foster's
Group Ltd. of Australia, also is on the prowl, Leedom said. Last week
it announced the purchase of the Carmenet brand from Napa-based
Chalone Wine Group Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   California produces wine with a retail value of about $13.4
billion annually, according to the Wine Institute in San Francisco.
It is the world's fourth-largest wine producing region, trailing
France, Italy and Spain, the institute said.</TE>
<TE>   Martini was founded in 1933 by Louis M. Martini, an Italian
immigrant and former fish seller who wanted to learn winemaking.</TE>
<TE>   He purchased two vineyards--Monte Rosso in the mountains above
Sonoma Valley and La Loma in the well-regarded Carneros district
south of Napa--and started making varietal wines such as cabernet
sauvignon, pinot noir and barbera.</TE>
<TE>   The first vintages from those grapes were aged and then released
in 1940.</TE>

<HD>Sidgmore Says He's Stepping Down</HD>
<DH>Telecom: WorldCom chief executive will stay until a
permanent replacement is found.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON STRAZIUSO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>JACKSON, Miss.</DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. Chief Executive John W. Sidgmore said Tuesday that he
would step down as soon as a permanent replacement can be found to
lead the telecommunications provider.</LD>
<LD>   "I have concluded that having moved WorldCom through the initial
phase of the bankruptcy process, now is the appropriate time for the
company to initiate a search for a long-term CEO," said Sidgmore, who
replaced company founder and former CEO Bernard J. Ebbers in April.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom, the nation's No. 2 long-distance carrier, filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection July 21 after it reported $3.9
billion in bogus accounting. That figure has been revised to $7.2
billion. The former telecom giant laid off 17,000 workers in June.</LD>
<TE>   Sidgmore said he intended to return to his former position of vice
chairman, and the Clinton, Miss.-based company said it "remains on
track to restructure and emerge from Chapter 11 protection in
mid-2003."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement followed a meeting of WorldCom's board of
directors to discuss a board member's use of a company plane and
whether it was tied to a generous severance given to Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   The board also considered rescinding Ebbers' severance package,
according to a report on the Wall Street Journal's Web site Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers' pay package allowed him to pay back a $408-million loan
over five years--at an ultra-low interest rate--starting in 2003 and
paid him $1.5 million a year in severance. A reversal of those terms
could allow creditors to seize Ebbers' assets, the Journal said</TE>
<TE>   Jay L. Westbrook, a professor at the University of Texas School of
Law and a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, said the
board might not be in control of what happens with Ebbers' agreement
because courts and creditors have a lot of say in what happens with a
company's finances when it seeks bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   "In a bankruptcy situation there's a tendency for the board of
directors to become dramatically less relevant," Westbrook said.</TE>
<TE>   At the board meeting, a lawyer for director Stiles A. Kellett Jr.
said his client asked the board for an opportunity to respond to a
report by a court-appointed monitor of WorldCom that questioned his
client's use of a corporate jet.</TE>
<TE>   "The board asked him to respond on Oct. 3 and we expect him to
make that date, but others said he can have more time if he wanted
it," Stuart Pierson said.</TE>
<TE>   Pierson would not discuss the contents of the report by court
monitor Richard Breeden, a former Securities and Exchange Commission
chairman. But the Journal said it criticized Kellett's use of a
company jet for $1 a month, plus operating costs.</TE>

<HD>More Firms Warn on Earnings</HD>
<DH>Profits: A 28% increase in downbeat forecasts compared with
second quarter is seen as a sign that the economy might not be
stabilizing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK OLIVARI</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>An increasing number of companies are warning that third-quarter
earnings are unlikely to meet expectations, reversing an improving
trend that began in 2001 and disappointing investors who were
optimistic the worst was over.</LD>
<LD>   Companies as diverse as casual-apparel retailer American Eagle
Outfitters Inc., railroad operator CSX Corp., health-care company
MedImmune Inc. and fast-food chain Jack in the Box Inc. have warned
investors in recent days that they won't meet profit expectations
this quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, earnings for the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500
companies still are expected to rise this quarter from a year
earlier. But the jump in profit warnings is a reminder that many
firms are struggling amid the sluggish economy.</LD>
<TE>   Through Tuesday, 765 companies had made earnings pre-announcements
for the third quarter, and 401 of those were negative--meaning the
firms believe their results will come in below previous expectations,
according to Boston-based earnings tracker Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The number of warnings is 28% more than at the same point in the
second quarter and on a par with the third quarter of 2001, when
profits in general still were in decline.</TE>
<TE>   "We normally see more negative [pre-announcements] than positive,"
said Joe Cooper, a research analyst at Thomson First Call. "As the
quarter begins, it's 50-50, but the closer to reporting season, the
more negative announcements, and we are in that stretch now."</TE>
<TE>   To Cooper and others, the increase in warnings is a sign that the
economy may not be stabilizing as had been hoped.</TE>
<TE>   Profit warnings "are an indication the economy has slowed,
something the market was already concerned with," said Joe Stocke,
managing director at money manager StoneRidge Investment Partners in
Malvern, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   The diversity of companies issuing warnings indicates the slowdown
"is more broad-based" than it had been, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter operating earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are
expected to be 10.9% above year-earlier levels, according to
analysts' consensus estimates. But that has come down from the 16.6%
rise analysts predicted at the start of the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 200 companies have announced that they expect results this
quarter to beat previous guidance. They include personal products
maker Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which last week said it expects earnings
to rise between 14% and 16% from a year earlier, thanks in part to
cost cutting.</TE>

<LD>Sales of War Bond</LD>
<LD>   Increase by 36%</LD>
<LD>   The government is reporting a 36% boost in sales of an ordinary
savings bond that was transformed into a "war bond" after last year's
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The Treasury Department, under pressure from Congress after the
attacks, brought back the war bond concept, which was a popular way
during World War II for Americans to help the war effort. Lawmakers
who urged the change said they were responding to constituents who
wanted to help pay for the war against terror and relief efforts for
the victims.</TE>
<TE>   As in the past, however, proceeds from war bond sales were not
earmarked for a specific purpose but went into the government's
general fund.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury reported $1.57 billion in sales of Patriot Bonds
between December, when the Series EE savings bonds were renamed, and
July. That is $419 million more than were sold during the same period
a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Patriotism may have helped spur sales, but the return on the bonds
didn't hurt the marketing effort, analysts said: Interest rates on
the bonds have hovered around 4%, which is attractive compared with
about 1.3% for money market mutual funds and even less on some basic
bank savings accounts.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Albert Aghazarian, 52, is a history lecturer at the Palestinians'
largest university, Birzeit. For him, the horror of the Sept. 11
attacks was compounded by the impression that Palestinians celebrated
the deadly acts. He notes that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
condemned the attacks and organized candlelight vigils in support of
America. But the damage was done. An Armenian Christian, Aghazarian
also identifies himself as a Palestinian.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "On the morning of Sept. 11, we received four European consuls at
the university who had walked around the roadblock and come to show
support for access to the school. That afternoon, I was driving in
Jerusalem when the news came over my radio. It was like from another
world. And then the early reports said Palestinians were involved. I
saw one of the consuls [again], and he said that if it was true that
Palestinians were involved, then the whole cause is lost. So in one
day I went from feeling a moving moment of international support to
feeling like I was in the culprit's cage.</LD>
<TE>   Israel is using Sept. 11 to show that now, from their angle, the
world gets a flavor of what they've been passing through.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the comparison is different, but Israel is using this.
They have been associating Arafat with [Osama] bin Laden, which is
absurd. Someone like Arafat is yearning for a cup of coffee in the
State Department or in the White House, a smile from Washington. And
Bin Laden wants something radically different--to completely
undermine America. They've put Arafat and Bin Laden in the same boat.
Once you do that, it's a real confusion. It only exacerbates the
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians have been paying a price. Israel has used Sept. 11 to
further sharpen the knife against the Palestinian people. And they
get away with it. This is certainly shaking the credibility of the
United States. I think the United States is contracting the disease
we are suffering here. I call it security-ism: not security, but the
ideology and the sanctity of security. [It's] when the obsession with
security becomes paranoia, when you start having to remove your shoes
at the airport to travel. Terrorism is one thing, but measures that
don't work and only feed paranoia--it brings out the worst in all of
us."</TE>

<LD>Karima Amiri, 37, is a typist for Afghanistan's Ministry of Mines and
Industry, a job she regained after the departure of the Taliban. She
lives in Kabul with her husband and five children, four of whom are
girls.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "We were sitting at home one night when we heard about the event.
My husband called to me to say the tower was on fire.</LD>
<TE>   Of course we in Afghanistan have a lot of experience with such
terrible things, but it was the first time it had happened in the
United States. Later, when it was clear that Al Qaeda was behind the
bombing, we knew something would happen in Afghanistan because Al
Qaeda and the Taliban were here.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Americans started bombing Kabul in October, we decided to
leave for Pakistan because my husband has a heart condition and he
couldn't sleep. We had to sell all we had at a very low price to the
secondhand seller, but we did it eagerly to have our bus fare to
Pakistan. And we still had to walk part of the way through the
mountains to the border. We came back in February.</TE>
<TE>   It brought big changes in our lives, a great number of changes.
Under the Taliban, women did not work, I couldn't go to the office,
and I lost my job. My husband also lost his job as a mechanical
engineer for the city because he was on the Taliban's "unwanted"
list, which is where they put you as a pretense if they had a friend
they wanted to replace you with. Now I have just got my job back,
although my husband still does not have his.</TE>
<TE>   I make a little extra money doing embroidery, but under the
Taliban I couldn't take my products to market because they would have
beaten me for talking to strangers. I was traumatized by that. But
now I am optimistic and feel very happy inside, and I am looking
forward to a glorious future."</TE>

weeknight "Ashleigh Banfield: On Location." Her current tour of
America for the network will end in Washington, D.C., and New York
today.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "When the north tower fell, I was a block and a half away from it,
far too close for comfort. I've never experienced fear and terror
like that.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, I haven't had the time to grieve or mourn along with
the rest of America, because I left right at the most heated part of
the disaster. I went right into the fire from the frying pan. I'm
still trying to plug through the confusion and terror of what
happened.</TE>
<TE>   My personal endeavor now is to try to understand my own feelings
as I return home, particularly to New York City, and that's not very
easy to do because I'm still confused. I don't know why I cry
suddenly and I'm overwhelmed with emotion at odd times.</TE>
<TE>   It's a little tough to talk about how 9/11 affected my career,
because in a sad way it had a good effect on me, something I've had
to come to grips with. A journalist waits for a good story regardless
of whether it kills her friends. I have two friends whose remains
were never found.</TE>
<TE>   I embrace what I've been doing and what's coming each day after
9/11 and I'm very thankful. But at the same time, I'm a little
confused as to how it should be playing out, and obviously I think
there's a fair bit of guilt that works its way into the formula, so
perhaps going back to ground zero on 9/11 will help me understand the
full picture.</TE>
<TE>   I've seen a story that was the impossible develop, and its
tentacles spread to every corner of the world. I got to see firsthand
many of the effects and explore avenues of my own sensitivity and try
to understand why certain things happen when they seem implausible.
It changes the way I think about things I do. It doesn't change the
way I live my life. I sort of live my life for my work, which is
all-consuming. I haven't seen my desk since Sept. 7.</TE>
<TE>   I was waiting for that big story to hit for 14 years, and it hit
with a vengeance and whipped me around like a tornado. But I'm riding
with it still and hoping it doesn't spit me out."</TE>

<LD>For two years, Terry Butler, 43, has worked as a mechanic at
Stoystown Auto Wrecker in rural Pennsylvania, a site known simply as
"The Yard" to locals, where customers drop in to get spare parts for
their cars. On Sept. 11, he was removing a radiator when he heard
United Airlines Flight 93 zoom over his head. He was one of just a
handful who saw the plane go down. It's been a year of tragedy and
drama for this region of Pennsylvania, about 70 miles southeast of
Pittsburgh. It's the same place where, in August, nine miners were
trapped in a flooded coal mine for 77 hours before they were rescued.
A year later, Butler still has trouble going to the spot in the
compound where he was standing when he saw Flight 93. So far, he has
been unable to walk up the hill to the crash site.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "I guess I was more or less in the middle of The Yard that day.</LD>
<TE>   I was just taking off some parts and I heard a plane. Usually the
planes only fly in one direction, so when I heard it, at first I was
looking in the wrong direction. When I turned around, there it was.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed like you could just reach out and touch it. I never saw
a plane up close like that. It was just right there.</TE>
<TE>   I looked up and saw it coming right above the trees there. It
started to go up, then just missed a hill, made a right turn and then
went down.</TE>
<TE>   I wish I had turned my head. But I didn't. I saw it go down.</TE>
<TE>   I radioed to the shop down there and they called 911. I heard the
fire whistle go off. You could see the highway from where I was, and
I saw the first firetruck come up the hill.</TE>
<TE>   I still wonder what was going through their minds on that plane,
how they took the plane over. I guess they assumed this was going to
be it, that they had no chance of survival.</TE>
<TE>   It's getting a little easier. But as the days get closer [to the
anniversary], we're getting more people asking us where it happened,
where the memorial will be. There are more people stopping in now,
asking about it and wondering where it happened.</TE>
<TE>   It's in a remote area. It's hard to find. You have to draw up a
map so people won't get lost. I really don't go into details. People
wonder where it went down. I point and show them. I show them how
close it was.</TE>
<TE>   I've never been up there. It's hard. I want to go up there
[today]. I'm going to try to go up.</TE>
<TE>   With the miners, that was really tough. It seems like one thing
after another around here. This is going to affect people forever.
It's tough."</TE>

<LD>Ray Carr, 57, is a licensed street vendor who works across the street
from ground zero. To his left and right are merchants selling tables
full of T-shirts, hats, glass and plastic replicas of the World Trade
Center towers; photo albums of the towers on fire and crumbling,
magazines titled "Terror" depicting the attacks; piles of key rings
bearing the image of the World Trade Center and similar merchandise.
In the middle of the bustling scene on Liberty Street he stands
sweating under a blazing sun, occasionally taking refuge in the shade
offered by a fence surrounding a vacant lot.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "I've been working down here for 10 years as a vendor, so I knew
this place long before people called it ground zero.</LD>
<TE>   People were very friendly, I had customers all the time, and it
was hard for me to come back here after 9/11 because I knew so many
of the people who worked in those buildings. I haven't seen some of
them in a long time. I wonder if they made it.</TE>
<TE>   This place can be so depressing, just thinking what happened, but
you've got to make a living, right? You have to keep working, even
though vendors like me get a bad rap from lots of people. You know,
the ones who say: 'Oh, you're selling T-shirts and other things.
You're making money off a tragedy.'</TE>
<TE>   But the way I see it, we wouldn't be here if people didn't want
these things. Thousands of people come by all the time, and if they
want to buy the FDNY and NYPD T-shirts I'm selling, if they want
T-shirts of the World Trade Center, they'll pay money for them. If
they didn't, I wouldn't be selling them. I'm meeting a need, that is
how I see it.</TE>
<TE>   This is free enterprise, and it's not easy work. I'm a licensed
vendor for the city, but it doesn't guarantee me space down here. I
have to drive down here at 5 a.m. every day just to make sure I get a
good spot near ground zero. And the cops have been squeezing us
lately.</TE>
<TE>   We don't have the workspace that we used to. I used to have a much
better spot, right on the corner over there, where there were lots
more customers. But it got taken away. So I'm happy with what I've
got. Each morning, I bring down tables and set up the T-shirts and
the hats, and then wait for customers to start showing up. Most
nights I don't leave until 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Most days, it's pretty sad being down here. I look across the
street at ground zero, and it's like a big hurt that never stops
hurting. You can't ever forget what happened, and the way I see it,
I'm just helping people remember.</TE>
<TE>   The people who died down here were working, and so am I. It's
business, man. It's as American as you can get."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was while attending a second-grade reading class at Emma E. Booker
Elementary School in Sarasota, Fla., to promote his education reforms
that President Bush learned America was under attack. In the presence
of her VIP guest, teacher Sandra Kay Daniels, 45, conducted the day's
lesson, which centered on a story about a pet goat.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "When [White House Chief of Staff] Andy Card came and whispered in
President Bush's ear, I knew something serious had happened. My heart
sank. You just don't walk in and talk to the president when he is
engaged in an activity and on live television.</LD>
<TE>   I knew something was up when President Bush didn't pick up the
book and participate in the lesson. Mentally, he left me. I still
didn't know what had happened. He said, 'Mrs. Daniels, I have to
leave now. I am going to leave Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan here to do the
speech for me.' Looking at his face, you knew something was wrong. I
said a little prayer for him. He shook my hand and left.</TE>
<TE>   When the president first came into the classroom, he was so
personable, he greeted the kids, there was excitement in the air.
When he got the news, he was a whole different person, his demeanor
changed. I saw a very gentle man come in my class, and when he exited
he had nothing but business on his mind. He had something to do, and
he was going to do it. But I had reporters, TV cameras and 16
children sitting in front of me, so I had to go on with the lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Then they called me into the president's holding room to tell me
what happened. A Secret Service man said, 'I have to tell you why the
president left.' I said I was glad somebody was going to. When I
heard, I said, 'Is this happening in the United States of America? Is
this happening here?' I heard what the man said, but I didn't
comprehend it. And then I just lost it emotionally. He grabbed me and
consoled me.</TE>
<TE>   But I had to get it together because I still had the kids in the
room and I had to tell them what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the kids wanted to know why things hadn't turned out as
planned. I had seen the TV monitor in the holding room, and I had to
judge how much to tell the children. Remember, these are
second-graders, so I explained what a terrorist is--that just like
there are good people in the world who do nice things to you, there
are terrible people who do bad things. I told them the terrorists are
mean people who do mean things, and that some people were hurt, and
that President Bush had to leave. He was here for a while taking care
of reading business, I told them, but now he had to take care of
something more important. He had to take care of the whole United
States.</TE>
<TE>   We went over what a hijacking is, and how the planes were run into
buildings. And I turned the TV set on. At that time, both [World
Trade Center] buildings were still standing. Then I clicked the set
off. I didn't want the children to be horrified seeing people covered
in smoke and soot. The children wanted to know, if people had been
hurt, who was going to take care of their children?</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on that day, when we got the news, everything was in
slow motion. We were on a high, watching the president's entourage. I
was peeking through my vertical blinds in my classroom just to see
the motorcade. But reflecting on what I now know happened, it was
like going into a tunnel. It was a roller coaster day: first high,
then low.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11 happened, we had a penny drive to help the victims,
as a token of how we felt. They brought in pennies and we put them in
a jar. A penny to these kids is like $1 million. We live in a low
socioeconomic area, and they gave of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't a one-day affair. We still talk about it. I know you
can't pray in school, but we bow our heads in a moment of silent
meditation. We don't want to forget what happened. The kids know and
they don't want to forget. They want to talk about it, and we talk as
much they want to. They understand life goes on, but we also have to
remember what happened.</TE>
<TE>   The tragedy has caused not only me but my whole family to look at
things a little differently--to appreciate life, to appreciate what
it is to be an American, to be with your family, to be in the land of
the free and the home of the brave. I'm more sensitive to others, and
it's caused me to grow as a person. And to put things in perspective
that are important and those things that are trivial.</TE>
<TE>   I grew up in Palmetto, Fla., and my dad only had a fourth-grade
education. He had eight children. He worked really, really hard to
make sure we all went to school, and college if we wanted to. When he
found out that President Bush was coming to his daughter's classroom,
[this] man who had worked in the field, growing gladiolas, of course
he was excited. He was very proud of his daughter, that I had been
chosen. I said, 'Do you want to come down to see what a classroom
looks like when it is converted to receive the president?' And I
brought him down, with his oxygen. He passed away Oct. 31. I have had
a roller coaster year."</TE>

<LD>Rudi Dekkers, a 46-year-old native of the Netherlands, owns Huffman
Aviation International, the flight school on Florida's Gulf Coast
where two of the Sept. 11 hijackers, Mohamed Atta and Marwan
Al-Shehhi, took flying lessons. For months, his business suffered as
a result of the notoriety.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "If you ask me if we have any Muslims coming over, would I look
differently at them, I'd say yeah. Right now, I want nobody here who
has anything to do with that part of the world.</LD>
<TE>   I understand the people responsible are not all Muslims, but Al
Qaeda. But if problems are being caused by some people who are pink,
I don't want anything to do with people who are pink.</TE>
<TE>   Atta started with a bad attitude and caused trouble everywhere. I
didn't like him from Day One; he was very rude to me. One morning I
saw him in a coffee break room. I started speaking German to him, and
I saw disbelief on his face, like he had seen water burning, as we
say in Holland. He said nothing and walked out.</TE>
<TE>   When you looked at his face, it was like seeing a living dead man
walking. His face had no expression, other than it looked like death,
like he had come out of the coffin. I had that impression the first
time I saw him. And I saw him for six months. Al-Shehhi was a likable
guy, always smiling, always friendly. But of course I don't like him
now. I would cut both of them in pieces if they were standing in
front of me.</TE>
<TE>   After a month, the chief flight instructor came to me and said,
'These two aren't listening, not paying attention. Can I expel them
from the school?' And I said, 'You betcha.' He told them, 'Listen, or
you are going to get kicked out.' After that, they changed. My
bookkeeper rented them a room but kicked them out after a week
because they were too dirty.</TE>
<TE>   Did I sense anything was wrong? No. We see a lot of kids from rich
families, rich backgrounds. Sometimes we kick them out.</TE>
<TE>   I went to Congress on March 18, and they found I did everything by
the book. Because when Atta and Al-Shehhi showed up, we checked their
immigration status, the status with their visas. We found out that
Atta had a B1-B2 business visa, and Al-Shehhi had a tourist visa. You
cannot do flight training on those visas, so we applied for student
visas.</TE>
<TE>   After Congress and people nationwide heard we did things by the
book, people started to fly into my airport and do business with me.</TE>
<TE>   The government, I think, is scrutinizing all the flight training
now, and therefore there are no foreign students. We still have
Americans; in fact, we have a few more Americans than before, but we
lost all the foreign students.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning, it was bad. We had some death threats. Now,
basically, all we hear is good news. People come up and say, 'Aren't
you the guy who owns Huffman Aviation?' And they shake hands with me.</TE>
<TE>   [After Sept. 11], the press was asking me, 'Don't you feel
responsible?' That question has gone away. Of course we didn't feel
responsible, because we did everything by the book."</TE>

<LD>As the federal public defender for the eastern district of Virginia,
Frank W. Dunham Jr., 59, represents accused terrorist Zacarias
Moussaoui and U.S.-born Taliban fighter Yaser Esam Hamdi. With
Moussaoui, Dunham serves as "standby counsel" for a client who
refuses to speak to him.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "What I anticipated was public outrage at anybody who would take
on a case defending a guy like this, but the public has been far more
tolerant than I ever expected.</LD>
<TE>   They understand that although this guy hates them and everything
they represent, he is also entitled to legal representation and he's
entitled to his day in court.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Moussaoui won't even talk to me now. I'm enemy No. 1 as far as
he's concerned. Before he fired us as his defense team, I saw him 55
times in jail. We'd have long visits.</TE>
<TE>   Since 9/11, I've always worn an American flag lapel pin, and I
think he associated me with the government.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, I'm Hamdi's counsel too, but I've never met the man.
[Hamdi is being held incommunicado as an enemy combatant in a Navy
brig in Norfolk, Va.] I may be the first lawyer in American history
to have that problem."</TE>

<KH>ESSAY BY J.R. MOEHRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER</KH>
<HD>A YEAR AFTER</HD>
<DH>A day we can't forget, a future we struggle to envision</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.R. MOEHRINGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After other American tragedies the standard question was, "Do you
remember where you were?"</LD>
<LD>   After Sept. 11 the better question is, "Do you remember who you
were?"</LD>
<LD>   A year later, we're wholly transformed. Not just changed or
challenged, but remade as a nation on a molecular level, since a
nation's molecules are its hearts and minds.</LD>
<TE>   Cynics have been carping lately that nothing has changed, that
everything has gone back to normal. But if things have regained a
surface normality, that doesn't mean we're the same. It means we're
surviving.</TE>
<TE>   Normality is cause for celebration. When we laugh at something
silly or obsess about the trivial--Martha Stewart or baseball
salaries--it's a triumph of the human spirit. We're forging ahead,
despite how different we are, despite the fear we feel and the things
we can't forget.</TE>
<TE>   We're more different than we know, more different than we dare to
admit, and it may take a generation to understand how. A year isn't
enough time, especially this year, which felt like one long day. It
took months to excavate the site of the World Trade Center--it could
take a lifetime to quarry its meaning and consequences.</TE>
<TE>   This American tragedy stands apart, affects us differently than
others, partly because it was the first tragedy that America
witnessed, live. Gettysburg, Antietam, Pearl Harbor, Normandy,
Oklahoma City--the most violent moments in American history weren't
seen by most Americans. We saw only their immediate aftermath. We saw
the dead, but we didn't watch them die. Pictures of carnage, accounts
of survivors, these were always subject to the sanitizing limits of
language and time.</TE>
<TE>   The mystic cords of memory were never plugged into live TV
cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Until Sept. 11. On that day we saw the unreal, in real time. We
saw the second plane pierce the tower, saw the towers crumble, saw
death as it happened, in a moment of national awe, a communal
witnessing that welded us together in a new way.</TE>
<TE>   Only recently has such a mass witnessing been possible. Only in
the video and digital age could the searing images of Sept. 11 have
become an instant and simultaneous part of the collective unconscious
of America. We grieve as much for those who died in the Pentagon and
Pennsylvania, but if we picture the World Trade Center first when we
think of Sept. 11, it's because we were all there, in Lower
Manhattan, via satellite.</TE>
<TE>   The hijackers wanted us to watch. They were counting on huge
ratings. But they misjudged their audience. They meant to sow terror,
and instead sowed horror, which is something different. Terror is raw
fear. Horror is fear with revulsion. Terror causes panic. Horror
prompts action, because revulsion brings resolve.</TE>
<TE>   By gluing us to our TV sets, the terrorists inadvertently glued us
to one another. They fused our hearts, and fates, and gave us a new
common denominator as a nation.</TE>
<TE>   After the images came the voices. In the days and weeks following
the attacks, we listened to those heart-rending recordings--radio
communications among out-of-breath rescuers, answering machine
messages from trapped workers. I love you. Take care of yourself.
Goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   We try to quiet the echoes of those voices. Some days we can't.
Memory is our other new enemy. The tragedy hijacks our train of
thought. We close our eyes and hear. We look at a bright blue autumn
sky and see the towers give way, again and again and again. We see
those men and women at the windows, yelling for help, waving shirts,
leaping. We think of how it must have felt, to fall.</TE>
<TE>   The memory of Sept. 11 is so large, so powerful, it alters
memories that predate it. We look at old magazines and newspapers,
and they seem death-shadowed and moot. We look at photos of ourselves
from a few years ago and wonder--Who was that? We look at pictures of
the towers when they were pristine, glittering in the twilight, and
we don't see them as cloud-topped anymore, but cross-haired. They
look in hindsight like two 110-story tombstones, like giant portents
signaling the date of their own destruction--11.</TE>
<TE>   We haven't had time this year to explore and discover all the ways
we're different, because we've been busy collecting information. Hard
facts have been hard to come by. We still don't know the exact number
of dead, and we may never. We still don't know the motive of the
terrorists. Did they hope to rule the world or just to ruin it?</TE>
<TE>   We still can't imagine what comes next. Sept. 11 will either be
remembered as the start of the terrorists' war on us, or the start of
our war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   We don't know what lurks around the corner, and until we do, we
won't be able to process the corner we've just turned. We live
suddenly in an age of unknowing--fighting an enemy we can't see,
whose mind we can't fathom, putting our faith in secret agents we'll
never meet.</TE>
<TE>   Until there is a turning point, a decisive moment, meaning will be
among the missing. And without meaning, without facts and answers and
some historical context, what should we do on this anniversary? What
can we do, but witness again, relive our common experience, retell
the stories of those who died--then retell ours?</TE>
<TE>   This may be the form that countless informal observances take
today. When we meet in coffee shops and bars, at work and at dinner,
we will describe what we saw and heard and can't forget, to people
who saw and heard and can't forget the same things.</TE>
<TE>   It's not redundant. It's a new dialect, a cultural shorthand, a
therapeutic exchange of images and voices and grief. It's the story
we can't stop telling, the day we can't stop living.</TE>
<TE>   This is who we are now, a year away from who we were.</TE>

<LD>With President Bush in Florida, Mike Gerson, 38, director of
presidential speech-writing, was working at home on Sept. 11 when a
colleague in the office called with the news of the World Trade
Center.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "He said, 'You'd better come in.' I got on Interstate 395 and saw
the plane come in. I didn't see the actual impact, but 395 curves
around the Pentagon, and I saw that plane coming in and said to
myself, 'That plane is too low; it's going to crash.' I made no
connection in my mind to the World Trade Center and heard nothing,
but I saw the smoke come up.</LD>
<TE>   I was there for two hours. In my car, I started to write some
thoughts about what the president might say that night, and I sent
them off to [presidential advisor] Karen Hughes, who eventually
organized the whole thing.</TE>
<TE>   And finally they turned us back around going the wrong way on 395.
And I went home. I finally got in touch with my wife, who had picked
up my son from day care. And there was literally no way for me to get
in to the White House. [Highway] 395 was closed; the Metro was shut.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, I got in as early as I could. I normally drive right
past the Pentagon. One of the most memorable experiences I had was
the smell of the Pentagon burning, that acrid smell. And I got a very
strange feeling, that symbol of American power burning.</TE>
<TE>   I believe it was the next day--it all blurs together--that the
president immediately said we need to have a national memorial
service. So I went in to talk to him initially about that speech. He
looked at me when I came in--and I know now he said this to other
people--but it was still amazing, he said, 'Mike, we're at war.' And
he had a real sense of that from very early in the process. And
that's a sobering experience; I'm not sure I ever thought I would
hear that.</TE>
<TE>   We talked about that speech, the National Cathedral speech, and
what he wanted to accomplish. I had just one day to write it.</TE>
<TE>   Watching him stand in the rubble with the megaphone in New York
later that day really reinforced to me that presidential leadership
is more than speech-making. It's a sense of moment. That day was a
turning point in the history of our presidency, and to some extent
the country.</TE>
<TE>   In the White House now, the biggest difference is a difference in
atmosphere. You know you are involved in an unfolding series of
events that are important in the history of the country. In the
normal period, before Sept. 11, it was hard to have that total story
line in mind. There was always something new, some different
challenge, some different piece.</TE>
<TE>   Even though we still have a lot of day-to-day stuff at the White
House, you know you are in an unfolding story."</TE>

<LD>In July 2000, Richard W. Glasgow, 47, was named commanding officer of
the Motor Lifeboat Station under the Golden Gate Bridge. It is the
Coast Guard's busiest search-and-rescue unit on the West Coast. But
the mission has changed since Sept. 11. The bridge is considered a
potential next target for terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "We're always going to be focused on search and rescue. But a lot
of our focus now is on defending the bridge. The crew takes it to
heart. We call ourselves the Guardians of the Gate. This is our
house. Nobody comes in our house and messes it up.</LD>
<TE>   We do a lot of patrols to the bridge. The other day we were out.
Somebody started yelling. We thought maybe somebody had fallen off.
It was a couple of ironworkers under the bridge yelling, 'Go, Coast
Guard!' That's something new that didn't happen before 9/11. That
made you feel real good."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Afraid to fly, Hasnain Javed was taking the bus from Houston to New
York when he was arrested at the station in Mobile, Ala., on the
morning of Sept. 19. His student visa had expired, and he became one
of more than 1,200 foreign nationals rounded up as Sept. 11
detainees. In April, he was deported to Pakistan. Now 21, he lives in
Karachi.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "I was living in New York. Brooklyn. Man, I love that town. I
still miss Coney Island and Brighton Beach, still miss the city,
hanging out and going out and having fun.</LD>
<TE>   But I was at the bus station and it was about to leave and I was
stopped with these other guys. I had overstayed. I had been in the
U.S. three years but only supposed to stay six months. I did high
school in New York and then started college. I always thought there
was a way to settle down and fix my status. And who knew this tragedy
was going to happen?</TE>
<TE>   They took me to the immigration office there. I called my aunt [in
Houston] and she told me, 'OK.' She was on her way and she had a
lawyer and she had my bond money of $5,000, and we could have a
hearing and decide what to do. She said, 'Don't worry about it.'</TE>
<TE>   Then suddenly they changed their mind. The officers said they were
going to take me to a Mississippi jail and I would stay there. They
had a bunch of Mexicans with us, and they took us the next morning.
Now I was worried. They locked us up in there. We were registered and
we were told the INS would be there the next morning to pick us up.</TE>
<TE>   They divided us into groups to go to different dormitories. I was
the only Pakistani out of everybody. Then we were put in the dorm,
and as soon as I got in there, I was given strange looks by the guys
already in there. They were white and black people both. They were
hard-core people, not detainees.</TE>
<TE>   They started looking at me in a strange manner. I had to make a
phone call, a collect call, and I did to my aunt's house to tell her
what was going on. As soon as I got off the phone, a guy walked up to
me and said, 'You better get your ass out of here.' I was scared,
very scared. Everybody in there were huge people. I only weigh 150
pounds. I'm 5-8 and those people were over 220 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   They started saying stuff. They were going to tell the authorities
that I was saying things about the U.S. That's why they were beating
me up. They slammed me in the face and chipped off my tooth. I
started crying and later on another guy came in and two people
started beating me up.</TE>
<TE>   The dormitory was huge. They were punching me and kicking me and
punching me in the face. My left ear, I can't even hear completely
now. I had bruises all over my head and face.</TE>
<TE>   Then they started calling me names, names like terrorist or
something like that. And I told them, 'Why why why? I had nothing to
do with this.' They said, 'You're Pakistani.' They called me
different terrorist names. They said, 'This is the first round. There
will be 10 rounds.'</TE>
<TE>   Later in bed, I was pulled off the bed and they tried to take my
clothes off and they told me to run and I was stripped naked. There
were three guys now, and they pinned my head to the ground and they
slapped me on the back. They were beating me and I was crying and
shouting.</TE>
<TE>   Then I looked and I found four officers standing right there. The
guys beating me stopped and I ran to the officers. I told them, 'They
were going to kill me! Get me out of here!'</TE>
<TE>   My aunt brought me home. She's the best. She took me back to
Pakistan too, and we had to stop in New York. I was scared being
there. Man, it scared the hell out of me. I've never been scared so
much. I was nervous that they might do something else to me.</TE>
<TE>   My life now, I'm like bored here. There's nothing to do in
Pakistan. I can apply for a U.S. visa, but I know they won't give it
to me. Life's been screwed up for me.</TE>
<TE>   I've been planning to go to college, maybe in Cyprus or somewhere.
I still want to study computer information systems.</TE>
<TE>   But, of course, it was something bad that happened to me, a very
bad experience to go through. Now I read in the papers there's been
other people that have been mistreated even worse than me. I thank
God I'm out of it.</TE>
<TE>   The injuries are fine, but the emotional injuries are going to
last for the rest of my life. Are things better now? Or are people
still being arrested by the FBI and the INS? Are people still
leaving?</TE>
<TE>   I still miss the U.S. I really do. I miss the whole place. The
whole year went by so fast, it's unimaginable. How's the weather in
L.A.?"</TE>

<DH>'That was the last touch of the Commander. In the echo of
my prayers, he died.'</DH>

<LD>Masood Khalili, 56, Afghanistan's ambassador to India, was one of
only two people to survive the blast engineered by Al Qaeda
operatives that assassinated legendary Northern Alliance leader Ahmed
Shah Masoud on Sept. 9, 2001, two days before the terrorist attacks
on the United States. The son of a famous poet and a believer in a
mystical Islam called Sufism, Khalili was a close friend of Masoud
for 23 years and still calls him "the Commander." He was sitting
between Masoud and a television camera packed with explosives. The
explosion left Khalili blind in his right eye, deaf in his right ear
and badly burned over much of his body, which was peppered by about
1,000 pieces of shrapnel. About 300 pieces are still in his left leg.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "Two or three days before I was supposed to go to Afghanistan, the
Commander called me and rushed me. He said, 'You have to come and see
me.' I told him, 'Of course.' But I doubted him. I said, 'If it's not
important, I can come a week later.'</LD>
<TE>   He said, 'No, no. If you are standing, run. If you are sitting,
stand and run.' The next day, I was on the way. And wherever I was in
Afghanistan, I was with him.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 8, after 11 at night, he said to all of his commanders,
'OK. Everyone should go. Khalili and me have something to talk
about.' We were the only ones on the whole bank of the Oxus River,
with a single, small lantern burning, two of us lying down on
mattresses on the floor, staring at the ceiling and talking, going
through the past: the war against the Soviets, the first time we met.
It was like a film that you go back to and rewind, and try to see as
much as possible, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, and pausing--and
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   He had a book by the greatest Persian poet Hafiz, a Sufi. It is
fantastic poetry. No one has been able to challenge it in the last
700 years. The tradition is that people wish something, and then they
open that book, and whatever comes, they say, 'Aha! This is what
Hafiz says about the future.'</TE>
<TE>   The Commander loved poetry, and he knew I loved to read it. He
told me, 'I'll wish; you open the book.' I opened the book, put my
finger on the page, and the first or second verse of the ghazal said:
'Oh, you two who are sitting tonight together, value this night. Many
years will pass: Nights will go, years will come, months will
disappear. You two will not have this night again. Value it.'</TE>
<TE>   We stayed quiet, without exaggeration, for at least 10 minutes. I
don't know what he was thinking, or what I was thinking. We were both
just quiet.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, we were seated side by side, so close that I
could feel the warmth from his shoulder. He looked at something on
the table and said, 'What is that?' 'It is my passport,' I told him.
'It won't fit in my pocket.' I tried to put it in my left shirt
pocket and it wouldn't fit, and then he came closer to me. He pushed
it, and it went in.</TE>
<TE>   Then he told me, 'Let's go to the next room. Two Arab journalists
have been waiting for a week or 10 days.' When I heard Arabs, I was
really reluctant and said, 'You go. I have to wash.' And he said,
'No, no, no. You have to go with me.'</TE>
<TE>   Those two Arabs came in, and after hearing the smallest one say,
'I do not represent any paper, I belong to Islamic centers based in
Paris, London--all over the world,' I whispered to the Commander,
'They are not journalists. They belong to that.' I didn't mention Al
Qaeda because I knew the Commander knew what I meant by 'that.'</TE>
<TE>   He asked them, 'Tell me some of your questions, and then I will
answer.' It was his habit. Out of 15 questions, eight were about
Osama bin Laden, questions like: 'Why are you against him? Why did
you say he was a killer?'</TE>
<TE>   'OK, start your camera,' the Commander said, and his chin was down
on his chest. I could tell he was not in a good mood.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab asked the first question of the interview: 'What is the
situation in Afghanistan?' I translated into Persian. I spoke just
half of the first letter of the first word of the first question, and
boom!</TE>
<TE>   For the next three minutes, I was fully conscious--more conscious
than ever--and it seemed like an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere there was fire. The worst thing was the smell. With
that smell, everything went inside me: the fire, the
smoke--everything. That was when I realized, 'Not only your friend
might die, you could too.' That was my first taste--the smell--of
dying.</TE>
<TE>   Others told me later that I was shouting loudly, 'Oh God, save me!
You have always been with me. In this time of difficulty, save me.
Liberate me!' Then I felt a hand on my wrist. That was the last touch
of the Commander. In the echo of my prayers, he died.</TE>
<TE>   What a man he was. I still don't believe he is dead. No. He is
alive. At least, every day he is alive for me in my memories. I have
to cry whenever I remember him, not because of terrorism, but because
I love him. Others look, to me, like foot soldiers. He looked like a
general. And there is a vacuum now.</TE>
<TE>   My wife said she found eight bits of shrapnel embedded in the
pages of my passport. It saved my heart. Ten times a day, I ask the
question, 'Why did I live?' I haven't found the answer.</TE>
<TE>   I don't see the power of death now. I was once scared of death.
I'm not saying I'm so brave against death now. I just say, 'OK, fine.
Come again.' "</TE>

<LD>Amy Machnak, 26, is the head pastry chef at the popular Boulevard
restaurant in San Francisco. She took over last year from Heather Ho,
considered one of the premier pastry chefs in the Bay Area, after Ho
left to become executive pastry chef at Windows on the World, atop
the World Trade Center. Ho, 32, died in the terrorist attacks. Those
at Boulevard were devastated. The restaurant organized fund-raisers
to establish a scholarship for pastry chefs at the Culinary Institute
of America. Ho, described as a genius of the sweet tooth and a
dynamo, became more of a fixture at Boulevard than ever. The staff is
still talking about her, and her picture is on everyone's desk.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "My first day was her last day. She was testing recipes, playing
around with a new dessert. I thought: 'How strange that she is
leaving and going to New York for this really great job, and she's
still testing recipes. Obviously, she's not going to put anything on
the menu here because today is her last day.' But I look back at it
now and I understand that she was just that creative. I don't think
her mind ever stopped. That was my only real impression of her
because I never really spoke to her. I never saw her again. That was
May 31.</LD>
<TE>   Starting here was horrible. All of my co-workers were very
judgmental. She was such a strong individual, such a strong presence.
People have told me that we are so completely different, in
personalities, in the way we do things. I kept telling myself: 'You
know what, you have some really big shoes to fill. She was No. 1, and
you've never even done this before.' I just told myself that I needed
some time, and that after six months people would get used to me and
they would forget about her. Four months later, Sept. 11 happened.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody was talking about it. We were hearing one minute that
they had found her and another minute that they hadn't. Time just
went on, and I think they assumed a couple weeks later that, like a
lot of people there, she would never be found.</TE>
<TE>   I always felt like I was being compared to her. My grandmother
said it was just like [President] Kennedy. She hated Kennedy. She
said he was in the back of a convertible in Dallas, and now half the
junior highs in America are named after him.</TE>
<TE>   In the last couple months, things have definitely gotten better. A
lot of it was my own insecurity. I was waiting for people to judge
me. That's what we do: We cook food and we let people decide whether
they like it or not.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think people compare me to her anymore. I think a lot of
the wait staff has come around and realized that I have a totally
different style, and that I'm coming from a completely different
point of view as far as my food, and that although my food may not be
better or worse than Heather's, it's just different.</TE>
<TE>   I think it's strange that a woman I never knew has affected my
life so much, in so many ways, for so long. But I think of this as my
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not planning on leaving any time soon. I enjoy working here.
It took me so long to get really comfortable and feel like I'm happy
and appreciated and feel relaxed enough to do as much as I can
talent-wise.</TE>
<TE>   We had peach and blueberry pie last month. It was really good."</TE>

<LD>On Capitol Hill, the terrorist attacks first scattered, then
galvanized lawmakers. Some wondered, in hindsight, whether they were
the target of the fourth hijacked airplane that crashed in rural
Pennsylvania. Sen. John McCain, the 66-year-old Arizona Republican,
had a personal connection to that plane.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "Like others in Congress and like most of America, I was a
spectator to the tragic events of Sept. 11. But I would like to tell
one story that may be of some interest.</LD>
<TE>   There was a young man aboard United [Airlines] Flight 93 named
Mark Bingham. You may remember him as the gay rugby player on the
plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, the one who called his mother on
an in-flight phone just before passengers stormed the cockpit in an
effort to stop the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of UC Berkeley, Mark worked in New York, and in 2000 he
was a volunteer for my presidential campaign. I only met him once at
a fund-raising event. We had a picture taken together that hung on
the wall of his office.</TE>
<TE>   As Mark and the other brave passengers of that flight were
fighting for their lives and ours, we in Congress were just beginning
a normal day of legislative business.</TE>
<TE>   I was reading the morning newspaper in the Russell Senate Office
Building. I had the television on and saw the film of the first
airplane hitting the World Trade Center. I wasn't sure what the cause
was. But, soon after, the second one hit, and it became pretty
obvious. A few minutes later, word came that we should evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   The scene was somewhat chaotic. People poured out of the
buildings. Some went to a park across the street. We didn't really
have an emergency plan. I think they've fixed the problem since then,
but at the time there were certainly no provisions for that kind of
threat.</TE>
<TE>   [Later], Mark's story began to make the news. His mother went on
television and said her son had admired Sen. McCain. She then called
me and asked if I would speak at his funeral. I said I would be
honored.</TE>
<TE>   What did I feel? Enormous sorrow and enormous pride. Sorrow that
Mark had to lose his life full of promise. But pride that as an
American, he was willing to give up his life in order to save [those]
of others. There is no greater manifestation of patriotism."</TE>

<LD>Boston-based men's clothing manufacturer Zach Meltzer, 63, lost his

<TE>   "It's still horrific for us, very difficult. I was getting on an
airplane flying from Massachusetts to Michigan. My wife called me at
the airport and told me to come home because something had happened
to one of my sons.</TE>
<TE>   I was only 10 minutes away from the house. I got home, and we
watched the building collapse. My son Stuart was only 32 years old.
He left behind two little boys who are now 4 and 1.</TE>
<TE>   The older boy, Jacob, they were best friends. He still talks about
his dad every day. My son was on the 105th floor of the WTC. He
called my daughter-in-law and said, 'Something terrible has happened.
I don't think I'm going to make it. Take care of the kids.'</TE>
<TE>   He was one of the only people found from the 105th floor. They
found him on March 12, which happens to be my wife's birthday and our
wedding anniversary. We saw it as kind of a sign.</TE>
<TE>   He had worked in Los Angeles at [talent agency] Creative Artists
Agency and then worked at Miramax Films. He had switched careers and
just accepted the job at Cantor Fitzgerald 3 1/2 months before [Sept.
11].</TE>
<TE>   I respect the firemen and policemen who lost their lives. Most of
the money went to them. I myself donated to the fund. The people who
died deserve an equal amount of retribution, but it didn't happen
that way.</TE>
<TE>   I ended up setting up a fund for my son for his children, and
Harvey and Bob Weinstein at Miramax Films were extremely generous and
kind to my son's family. Extremely generous.</TE>
<TE>   When you are a parent and you bury a child, you take a part of
your body and you put it into the ground. It's the hardest thing.
It's hard to explain what it's like. I talked to my son every day and
I don't hear from him anymore. He'll never see his sons grow up. It
doesn't get easier. It gets harder."</TE>

<LD>Maria Mena, 53, is a housekeeper at the upscale Four Points by
Sheraton Santa Monica hotel, which caters to airline pilots and
flight attendants on layover. She has worked at the hotel for 18
years and was a supervisor at the time of the terrorist attacks. The
following month, as tourism slumped and hotels laid off thousands of
workers, Mena lost her job. Six months later, she was rehired--but on
an on-call basis. She now has less job security, lower wages and no
health benefits.</LD>

<LD>   "That morning, I was getting ready for work and I had the
television on as usual. We saw the building in New York after the
plane hit it. We thought something must have happened to the pilot.
Fifteen minutes later, we saw the second one hit and knew it was
something horrible.</LD>
<TE>   I went to work and it was a very sad day. So many people from the
airlines. A pilot was there in the lobby, crying, trembling. He said
his brother was the pilot of one of the planes that crashed. I was
supervising the girls all day and it was very hard for them. Everyone
was in their rooms, watching television. They didn't want service. We
just tried to do what we could to help them. It was like that all
week.</TE>

But then the business started dropping. In October, they told me to
take two weeks' vacation. Then they called me in and told me there
were no hours for me. It hit me really hard. I spent the whole night
crying. I didn't sleep at all. I felt abandoned. This was the only
job I had practically since I came to this country.</TE>
<TE>   My husband took me to church every day and I prayed for my job. I
felt like I was drowning. Before, I made $700 every two weeks,
sometimes $800 with overtime. Now I might get $570. It's not enough.
Thanks to God, we have some help. The community is helping me pay
bills. The union is giving us bags of food. What I'm really worried
about is the medical benefits. Before, I had insurance for the whole
family. Now I have to go to a clinic. I hope if we get the union, I
can get full-time work and benefits again. Without that, how can
anyone survive?</TE>
<TE>   It seems unjust, because I see them still hiring part-time workers
but I am still on call. It hurts, everything they've done. And I'm
not the only one. What happened to me has happened to a lot of
people."</TE>

<LD>Gigi Nelson, 40, of Huntington Station, N.Y., went into labor during
the memorial service for her husband, firefighter Peter Nelson. She
gave birth to their daughter, Lyndsi, on Oct. 6.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "The anniversary has really stirred things up. Not a moment goes
by in a day when I don't think about him. Everybody says you'll get
better and time heals all wounds, but this is such a gaping wound
that I don't ever see it healing. It probably doesn't help that I
have pictures of him all over the house. There are so many
reminders--her [Lyndsi], for one. She looks like him.</LD>
<TE>   We weren't sure whether they were going to find him. We decided as
a family that we were going to have a memorial, and then if they did
find him, we would do a funeral.</TE>
<TE>   There was a lot of stress, and even though she wasn't due for
three more weeks, I started going into labor during the memorial. My
brother-in-law was sitting behind me, and we set up a little system
that I would tap my shoulder when a contraction was starting and he
would time them. Finally, he said, 'Gigi--you're three minutes
apart!' But I felt OK. I wanted to let all the firemen and policemen
to come up and pay their respects. I made it through to the very last
one. Then I stood up and I said, 'OK. It's time to go the hospital.'</TE>
<TE>   I had the baby two hours and 40 minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   I felt Peter's presence in the delivery room. We all did, even the
doctors and the nurses. Everybody was saying, 'He is here.' I just
felt him, I can't explain it. I just felt like he was looking at me,
saying, 'It's OK, I'm here, everything is going to be OK.'</TE>
<TE>   Peter wasn't scheduled to work that day. But the night before he
was asked to fill for the early shift on Sept. 11, so he was on the
first truck to the World Trade Center. I run that through my mind
almost every day: if only he hadn't been working then, if only, if
only. But you can't do that. You'll make yourself crazy.</TE>
<TE>   I keep sane because I have a lot of family. My mother has not left
my side. My family and friends are always here to help.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when it was just nightmares, nightmares, you
know. When I didn't get enough sleep, my mom would take over and say,
'I'll watch the baby--get some rest.'</TE>
<TE>   I still get mail from all over. If I know it's going to be a tough
day for me, I won't open the mail. I'll wait for a day, sometimes
I'll wait for a week. I tell my mom, 'Don't worry, I pulled out the
bills.' But some days I just can't read the letters.</TE>
<TE>   I started corresponding with a woman from North Carolina. I've
never met her, but for some reason, she touched me. She keeps
writing; she doesn't mind if I don't write her back.</TE>
<TE>   At night when I can't sleep, I write to her. I tell her that she's
a lot better than therapy.</TE>
<TE>   I see the other wives who lost their husbands every once in a
while, but we're all busy. We were together recently for a plaque
dedication for the guys at the firehouse who were killed in the
Father's Day fire. But we're trying to celebrate life too, not just
death. I call sometimes just to see how they're doing, but we all
know how we're all doing, and no one is doing that great.</TE>
<TE>   There are days when I feel like I can't do this, but I have to.
None of these men would want to see us give up. Peter would be so mad
at me if he saw me crying every night. I think of that, and that
keeps me going.</TE>
<TE>   Lyndsi is amazing. She's crawling, she's waving bye-bye. She says
'da-da' all the time. I know all babies do that, but for me, it
breaks my heart to hear it. I show her his helmet and his picture and
I say, 'There's da-da.' I have two big boxes of cards and letters and
newspaper clippings for her. When she's old enough, we can go through
these things and I can show her, this is what was going on in our
country, this is who your dad was. I wonder what she is going to
think about all this.</TE>
<TE>   The guys at the firehouse have been great. They were at the
hospital when Lyndsi was born. They took care of everything, the
paperwork, the applications for survivors' benefits. I didn't know
some of these people because Peter had only been in this firehouse,
Rescue 4, for a year. But there they were. They acted like, 'You're
Peter's wife and therefore you're one of us.'</TE>
<TE>   He used to talk about the brotherhood, the brotherhood. I would
say, 'What are you talking about? You have brothers--they're your
blood.' But you know what? Now I know what he's talking about."</TE>

<HD>Myrtis Ann Parham</HD>
<DH>'Then ... came the insight that war had come home not just
to us, but to me.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Myrtis Ann Parham, 58, is chief of policy for the Army library
program, which provides books for soldiers overseas. She was working
at the Pentagon when American Airlines Flight 77 slammed into the
building just below her second-floor office.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "I notice everything about my physical surroundings now. Every
time I walk into a room that is new to me, I notice where the exits
are; I think about how I would escape in an emergency. When the
lights go out temporarily, my heart skips a little beat. Every time
the fire alarm goes off, I'm up out of my chair before most people
have even registered annoyance.</LD>
<TE>   The only warning we had that day was watching the second plane hit
the tower and realizing that there'd been two, that this was not an
accident. Unfortunately, we didn't heed the warning. There was a
television set near my cubicle, so we were all gathered around
watching. People were wandering in and out, in shock. A few commented
that we were at war, and that the Pentagon was at ground zero in that
fight.</TE>
<TE>   Even though I was shaken up, I went back to my desk. I was leaving
that Saturday for a trip home to Georgia, and work has a way of
beckoning when you're trying to get out of town.</TE>
<TE>   The simple act of returning to my desk may have saved my life. All
of a sudden, there was this unbelievable concussion, this huge noise,
like the world had come to an end. The plane had crashed into the
Pentagon just under our office. Everything shook, the lights went
out, things started to fall from the ceiling. I think I was knocked
to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   I know that I was hit on the head by a ceiling tile, because later
I found pieces of the ceiling in the pockets of my clothes. In that
first instant, there was this intense feeling, which I experienced
for several weeks, this realization that the horror of violence and
war had come to us, chased evil to our shores.</TE>
<TE>   And then, in the next second, came the insight that war had come
home not just to us, but to me, that it had fallen like dead weight
on my head. I put my hands up protectively, burning them. And from
that moment on, I was so focused on survival I didn't think about
anything else. I'm not proud of it, but that's what happened. I felt
the extreme heat, the unbelievable heat, the heat of suffocation, and
I knew that if I didn't get out of there fast, I was not going to
make it.</TE>
<TE>   So began the most frightening five minutes of my life. I yelled
for a co-worker named Patrick. Later, he told me that when he looked
back toward my voice, I was silhouetted by a ball of fire.
Fortunately, I didn't turn around and look back.</TE>
<TE>   I felt my way to a desktop. I wondered if this was where I was
going to die. And I started thinking about my mother. I remember
thinking that she would not want to get this kind of news. So I kept
moving, I just kept moving.</TE>
<TE>   I knew that I had lost a shoe and I even contemplated stopping to
take the other one off. But I couldn't take the time, I just kept
going. I got to another place where I ran into something and I had
the same thought again. Is this going to be it?</TE>
<TE>   Finally, I saw a light. I think now that it was from the windows
in the Pentagon's C Ring, halfway between where the plane hit and the
corridor to the exits. But it looked so far away, like London in a
fog. I just started stumbling in that direction. Patrick came along
somewhere then and we sort of stumbled out of there into the A Ring
corridor.</TE>
<TE>   There was a great relief in getting out into the hallway, because
we were out of the fire. All of a sudden I felt pain. I noticed that
my hands were burning, my face was burning and, worst of all, my eyes
were burning.</TE>
<TE>   And I knew that I'd been hit with something wet, but I didn't know
then that it was jet fuel. I wanted to stop at a bathroom and wash
out my eyes. Patrick looked at me like I was crazy and said no, we
had to keep moving.</TE>
<TE>   When we finally got out, it was bedlam out there--cars, ambulances
everywhere. I had on a purple silk jacket and the whole shoulder, all
the way across, was scorched. It was black. From collar to hem, I was
splashed in jet fuel. I didn't want to look at people. I was afraid
if I looked at people and saw the look of horror in their faces, it
would be even more frightening.</TE>
<TE>   That evening at Arlington Hospital, the Army's surgeon general,
James B. Peake, visited. It was about 11:30 p.m. and he was making
the rounds at all the hospitals in the area. He was by himself, no
entourage. In the bed next to me was a guy from my office who had
jumped out the windows from the second floor and survived.</TE>
<TE>   For the first two weeks, I walked around and cried at the drop of
a hat. I felt vulnerable whenever I heard the Air Force patrol jets
in the skies. It was frightening to return to this building. But it
never occurred to me to quit, absolutely not. You look around and see
other people pick themselves up and keep going. You have a job to do,
and you do it.</TE>
<TE>   It took months before hair grew again on the bald spot on my head.
I had a broken toe and second-degree burns on my face. They sent me
to a plastic surgeon, who provided his services for free. And I
finally said to him, 'You know, people have been telling me my skin
looks great. Do you think maybe I had a laser peel?' And he said,
'That's exactly what you had, except that it was an uncontrolled
burn.' "</TE>

<LD>Shahzadah, 49, a militia commander who is now brigadier general in
the Afghan army, was a zone commander on Sept. 11 in the Northern
Alliance, the opposition force that helped the U.S. drive the Taliban
from power.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "Every human being on Earth was affected by the sad news. I was at
my base at Jabal os Saraj preparing for a battle when I heard about
it on satellite TV. I couldn't believe it. It didn't occur to me that
Al Qaeda was responsible, because the attacks were so far away and I
thought they were incapable of such an action. I thought it might
have been an internal dispute in the United States. When it became
known after a few days it was Al Qaeda, I thought, yes, because of
their strong network, but [it is] still hard to believe they could
have planned such a big plot.</LD>
<TE>   When it happened, we had just heard about the injury of our
commander, Ahmed Shah Masoud. We later learned he had been killed by
Al Qaeda. The Northern Alliance didn't want us to know about it
because of the battle we thought was coming in the Shomali plain
north of Kabul, and they knew the news would hurt our morale. So they
played a tape of his fighting orders that he had made previously over
the loudspeakers, and for a while we believed he was alive.</TE>
<TE>   Then Sept. 11 happened, and the Taliban just stopped fighting. A
day later they withdrew. And then we found out that our great
commander, whom we miss every day, was dead. So we felt the effects
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   If [the terrorist attacks] hadn't happened, we would probably
still be fighting, and I wouldn't be here in Kabul. The event finally
brought world attention to Afghanistan, that it would have to get rid
of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   It would have reacted eventually because Al Qaeda would have
struck somewhere else sooner or later. They aren't gone from here
yet. They bombed the power lines that bring electricity to Kabul from
the east, and our division is providing security so that it doesn't
happen again."</TE>

<LD>Saul Singer, 41, is editorial page editor of the conservative
Jerusalem Post daily newspaper. American-born, he immigrated to
Israel eight years ago. It was late afternoon in Jerusalem when the
World Trade Center towers were hit. Singer's editorials have urged
Washington to take its "war on terrorism" against Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "The minute we heard that a second plane had hit, we knew it was a
terrorist attack. Coming from Israel, I think we more quickly suspect
terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Israel was already under attack. Now it was clear that the United
States was under attack. I understood how Americans felt. I knew how
they would be feeling in terms of being attacked by terrorists. It
was a process where terrorism was spreading. As part of that, I
expected there would be more sympathy for Israel. Now Americans would
have the kind of feelings that we have here.</TE>
<TE>   It took some time, but as the war on terrorism has gone on, I
think Israelis feel they are not alone. Initially there was concern,
almost shock, when it seemed that the allies that the U.S. was
gathering included Syria and Arafat and so on and maybe even Iran.</TE>
<TE>   That changed relatively quickly. The big turning point was
[President Bush's] State of the Union address, when he made clear
that anybody who harbored terrorists is a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   The question Israelis had was, would there be separate
standards--some countries that support terrorism but are not targeted
for 'regime change' and others that would be?</TE>
<TE>   We had written in editorials that we were concerned that Arafat
was operating as if he had immunity, and that was contributing to
attacks against Israel. We connected Saddam [Hussein] and Arafat,
saying that heating up the Palestinian situation was Saddam's best
defense against attack. Since the United States decided the Middle
East had to be quiet before it hit Saddam, the more Arafat heated up
things, the more safe it was for Saddam.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's June 24 speech [calling for Arafat to be replaced] got out
of that bind. It released the U.S. from that trap.</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to think that Israel was being persuasive, but I think
it's more a matter of reality being persuasive. It became clear that
if the attack on Iraq were to wait for peace in the Middle East, and
there were no consequences for Arafat's heating up the situation,
then the U.S. was in a bind and the war on terrorism would be
stymied."</TE>

<LD>Kathleen A. Treanor, 39, lost her 4-year-old daughter and her
husband's parents in the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City. After Sept. 11, the stunned Guthrie,
Okla., resident flew to New York to comfort the bereaved. But after
Congress set up a compensation fund expected to pay, on average,</LD>
<LD>   $1.65 million to relatives of the Sept. 11 terrorism victims,
Treanor's grief was laced with anger.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   "I knew it was terrorism right away, there was no doubt in my
mind. See, we always thought there would be more attacks. The first
thing I said when the buildings came down, I said, 'Oh, my God, I've
got to go to New York City.' That day I suffered with them. I came
home and curled up in the fetal position and stayed there. I was
devastated; I wept constantly. I knew. You can't begin to imagine.</TE>
<TE>   My 4-year-old daughter and my mother-in-law and father-in-law were
all killed in the attack here. They had a 9 a.m. appointment at
Social Security. My father-in-law was getting ready to retire, and he
had a mistake on his birth certificate, so he was trying to get it
fixed. Wrong place, wrong time. It was hard for me to even find the
will to live again.</TE>
<TE>   I went to New York; I escorted the families to ground zero. We'd
load up the ferries at Pier 94 and take the 20-minute trip, and the
families would have a short time to view the site. They'd pray and
grieve and cry.</TE>
<TE>   It was just a few weeks later that Congress enacted the victim
compensation fund, and they'd left us out. And I couldn't quite
understand how they'd managed to do that. It was very hurtful. The
more I read the more upset I got, and the more I realized we'd been
totally shoved aside. We were no longer the tragedy of the day. We
were the biggest act of terrorism in the United States. That all
changed on Sept. 11. Not that I disliked having the focus off my
family, but the fact that we were unceremoniously shoved aside and
disregarded--I mean, that was a federal building, and one could argue
that the government's own actions prompted Timothy McVeigh to do what
he did.</TE>
<TE>   They said no American should have to bear the act of terrorism
alone. Well, we're victims of terrorism too. There are many who had
nice homes, a typical, middle-class American life, and now they're
living from cardboard boxes. In my case, we had 240 acres with
cattle. My father-in-law had no life insurance. We let 80 acres go.
Nobody bailed us out. We had to do it all ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Well, Pandora's box has been opened now, and now they need to make
it right and they need to make it fair. So when the government said
we're going to compensate victims, somebody had to scream loud and
scream long.</TE>
<TE>   I started writing letters to Congress and senators and got
nowhere. Really, zero response. Finally I formed a group called
Fairness for Oklahoma City. We rallied support to be included, and
it's my understanding that now we will be included."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Chrilla Wendt, 64, is a teacher of architecture and archeology at
Hamburg Technical University in Germany. On a group vacation in
Georgia and Armenia on Sept. 11, she watched the events unfold on
satellite television from her hotel in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi.
Four days later, Wendt discovered that the suicide pilot who flew the
first jetliner into the World Trade Center was Mohamed Atta, the
graduate student she had worked with hour upon hour to polish his
master's thesis.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "The first I heard of the attack was from our tour guide when she
came to collect our passports as we were about to cross from Armenia
to Georgia. She said something about planes flying into New York
skyscrapers. We could hardly believe it but were eager to see what
was on television when we got to our hotel.</LD>
<TE>   For me, it was really awful. I lived through the Allied bombing of
Hamburg, and as I watched those images repeated again and again, I
had the same terrified reaction, like the world was ending.</TE>
<TE>   At first we could only get Georgian TV, so we had no idea what
[the broadcasters] were saying. Then CNN came on and we all just sat
there watching for hours in disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   I came home on Saturday night and still didn't know about any
Hamburg connection. I didn't know a thing until I went to a friend's
house for lunch the next day, someone who always invites me after
I've been away on vacation.</TE>
<TE>   She had saved the newspapers for me, and when I walked into her
house, I glanced at them and thought, 'What is Mohamed's picture
doing on the front page at a time like this?'</TE>
<TE>   My friend knew he'd attended the technical university, and when
she saw my reaction, she said, 'Do you know him?' I still couldn't
speak. It was just so unreal. Even today, I can't put the two
experiences together--the shock of seeing the planes hitting the
buildings, rerun on television again and again, and the later shock
of learning it was this calm, polite young man who had sat beside me
for so long in this office. It still seems to me to be two
experiences that have nothing in common.</TE>
<TE>   I've read and reread his thesis, but there's just nothing there
that betrays his thinking. One can detect a tone of regret about what
has happened between the Arabs and the Israelis and how that is
reflected in Aleppo [the Syrian urban development case study Atta
profiled in his thesis]. But there's not a trace of the anger or hate
that you'd expect to have motivated such an attack. It was a
scientific work, very serious and unemotional.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, it doesn't haunt me. It still seems too unreal to have
affected my thinking. Even now, almost a year later, I still don't
have a frame of reference."</TE>

<LD>Izzat Hassan Ali, 40, is a grocery store clerk in Zamalek, a leafy
residential neighborhood in Cairo. He holds a degree in Arabic
language and Islamic studies from Cairo University but is forced to
work behind the counter at Al Jihad market because of the poor
economy. He enjoys chatting about current events with his friends
working at the fruit stand, the carpet shop and the dry cleaner on
his block. Izzat was in the grocery going about his daily routine
when a passerby told him about the attacks. He and his fellow
shopkeepers switched on a TV and watched in amazement.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "My immediate reaction was, 'This is divine revenge!' I had been
watching the TV and saw what they were doing to the Palestinians and
the Iraqis and thought, 'God must be behind this.' I thought more
things were going to happen. I was just planted in front of the TV.</LD>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, I felt like most other people here about the U.S.
We are constantly targeted by the U.S.; their policies are against
Muslim countries. It's a nation that helps Israel, how else can I
feel about it? After the events were definitely over and people
learned the facts about what happened, learned that this was a very
organized attack, found out how many people were killed or hurt,
things began to sink in. The way I felt about the U.S. didn't change,
but I did feel awful about the people who died. Simply awful. This
was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   There are other ways to influence American foreign policy; it
didn't have to be through killing innocent people.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is becoming too strong. We must do something. I think one
way to affect American policy is by boycotting American goods. I am
boycotting American goods as much as I possibly can. Many people have
boycotted American goods since</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11. People used to come in asking for Heinz tomato sauce or
Johnson's products, but now they ask me for alternatives. I think the
boycott is a good idea. It's better than participating in
anti-American demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   I have dealt with Americans in the shop before. They are very
nice, very decent people. The problem is American politics; that's a
different thing altogether."</TE>

<LD>Suliman Ali Baldo, 52, works in the Empire State Building as a
researcher for Human Rights Watch. Baldo left Sudan seven years ago
to escape intensifying harassment of critics of the government. At
that time, Sudan was a haven for Osama bin Laden and locked in civil
war, with radical Islam gaining influence. Because of Sept. 11, Sudan
began to change, and Baldo is going home.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "On Sept. 11, I was here in the Empire State Building. There's a
big window in the conference room that looks directly south at the
World Trade Center.</LD>
<TE>   My colleagues saw the airplane hitting the first tower. They were
standing at the window and trying to make sense out of it. They saw
the second plane coming and hitting the other building, and their
immediate reaction was that this was a deliberate attack. They
thought there were several small planes flying around hitting tall
buildings in New York; therefore, they were a bit panicked and they
ran here and got me and evacuated everyone.</TE>
<TE>   I immediately suspected it was Al Qaeda because of [its] pattern
of deliberate attacks on U.S. targets. I discussed it with my
colleagues as we were milling around after evacuating. The group
bombed the U.S. embassies [in Africa] and the USS Cole, regardless of
the consequences for innocent people and the local population. The
idea that kept coming back was that we should have seen it coming.
This idea kept haunting me. They should have known this was coming;
they should have taken precautions.</TE>
<TE>   For me, it's not a failure of intelligence, it's a failure of
understanding what lengths they would go to. I remember going home on
Sept. 11. I found three dozen messages from Sudan, the [Persian] Gulf
countries, friends from all over the Arab world. The attack was seen
within the region as totally shocking. All these people--Arabs and
Muslims--called just to see if we were OK and to say it was horrible
that it happened. I still have the e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   My two kids still come with me to the office sometimes. They like
the Empire State Building. Even though I come from a flat country
with nothing but one-story buildings, I don't have any special
worries about working here. But other people who know I work here are
afraid for me because it is a symbolic building and now it's the
tallest building in New York. There seems to be a general fear out
there about tall buildings.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning, there were lots of fire alarms in the building,
bomb scares and evacuations. We hear the alarm, then we have to
leave--maybe once a week at first, not so often now. We take it very
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   I try not to think about [Sept. 11]. But it's an event that you
are reminded of every day. Sirens and things are a constant reminder.
There are also the international repercussions: the war in
Afghanistan, threats of war in Iraq, the changing environment in
international circles.</TE>
<TE>   It is reflected quite strongly in my home country, Sudan. Sept. 11
has brought about real change. Because of this event, things are
happening that were not conceivable a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Sudan once provided a safe haven for Osama bin Laden when he had
no place else to go. His movement was allowed to gain power there.
They kicked him out in 1996 because of all the pressure from the
U.S., and now, once again, they are cooperating because of American
pressure. They don't want to be on the receiving end of this kind of
terrorism, or to be held responsible for it.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, there is some space to develop the foundation of civil
society. Now there can be an independent media, women's rights
associations, independent human rights organizations [and]
environmental groups."</TE>

<LD>Swaran Kaur Bhullar, 52, emigrated from Kenya in 1988 after falling
in love with the San Diego area during an earlier visit to her
husband's relatives. She now is an owner of a video store in Del Mar.
Bhullar, a mother of three, is one of an estimated 100,000 Sikhs in
California. Her middle name, Kaur, is carried by many Sikh women as a
reminder that all people are created equal. She has never been to the
Middle East and is a U.S. citizen. But she is, as she puts it, "a
brown woman." She was one of dozens of people of foreign ancestry who
were victims of hate crimes in the weeks after Sept. 11. Two men
ripped open her car door, slashed her in the head with a knife and
shouted: "This is what you get for what you've done to us!" She has
recovered from her wounds, but she locks the door now when she
drives.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "I was going to work for the evening shift. About 3:30 I left the
house. I was thinking: 'I'm going to have a nice day. I'm going to do
good business.'</LD>
<TE>   I stopped at a traffic light. As soon as I stopped, a motorbike
pulled by my side. A guy came from the back. There were two of them.
He opened the door. He had something in his hand. When he said, 'I'm
going to slash your throat,' I think it was a blessing. Had he not
told me that, I would have kept my [head] up. When he went for my
throat, I went under the steering wheel.</TE>
<TE>   It was so fast. Within 15 or 20 seconds everything was done. At
that moment I could not trust anybody. I didn't think it was
advisable for me to go to the side of the road and ask for help. I'm
sure that so many people would have helped me at that point. But I
drove to my store. My customers, when they saw me, they brought me
into the store. Somebody could have just taken my life, so fast. It's
something nobody deserves.</TE>
<TE>   I'm very peaceful here. But after what happened, I thought this
place wasn't safe. I have to take the same route every day. Every
single day. I have to pass the same traffic light. There hasn't been
a single day when I don't remember. When I'm approaching, I'm very,
very careful about who is next to me. I especially don't like
motorbikes. I hate them. Every time I look at a motorbike, I'm always
looking for [my attackers].</TE>
<TE>   After it happened to me, I just realized that there were such nice
people around me. Two bad people cannot spoil the whole thing. I got
one letter from the church. Three hundred people signed that letter.</TE>
<TE>   I think [Sept. 11] divided people. I know a lot of Indians, very
nice people. I know six or seven ladies who used to wear the outfits
that cover their heads. They stopped wearing that. They cannot even
pray freely.</TE>
<TE>   I could not give [investigators] a full description. They were
asking me, 'What sort of bike was it?' I know it was a black bike and
that it had some chrome. The only thing I saw was a little hair,
reddish-type. I could see that they were not teenagers. Besides that,
I could not give them any of the information. The FBI came in here.
'How come you didn't take the license plate number?' 'What sort of
motorbike was it?' I was trying to figure out if I was alive.</TE>
<TE>   If they were arrested and punished, I would have felt a little
better. I feel that they are still free. But it doesn't bother me.
I'm OK. I compare myself to somebody who has lost their kids, or
their life. I feel that I am safe and that I am going to be fine.</TE>
<TE>   Here, if something happened and I picked up the phone and called
911, a cop would come to my place at once. If I was back home in
Kenya, for three days nobody would come. Seriously. They would say,
'Well, we don't have gas in the car.' That is what happens in Kenya.
Everybody should be happy about what God has given them. We have a
beautiful country here. Everybody should mind their own business.
They should not think about fighting."</TE>

<LD>"My security officers in the lobby prior to Sept. 11 were greeters.
They were lobby ambassadors, friendly smiles, [a]
'welcome-to-our-home' kind of thing. Now, it's 'OK, who are you?' You
come in. You are not in a suit. You are not in a tie. What is your
business?</LD>
<LD>   Our job is to make sure that no ones gets to a floor unless a
tenant wants them on that floor. So, we have a system in place where
the tenants will let us know who they are expecting. Everybody checks
[in] in the lobby. If they're passed [through], then we will take
them through the turnstiles and access them to the floor they are
visiting. If you are a courier carrying a backpack, plan on being
searched. If you parked in the Library Tower garage, your car will
have been searched.</LD>
<LD>   What I've learned is to deal with the things that you have control
over. Don't worry about things you don't have control over. There
isn't anything I could be able to do if a 747 slams into the top of
this building."</LD>

<DH>The World War II veteran and VFW commander, 77, sizes up
the new enemy.</DH>

<LD>"We have about 1,000 members at the VFW here. They're all getting
old. After Sept. 11, all of them wanted to go after Afghanistan and
everything, but now nobody really knows what to do. Here we've
attacked Afghanistan and now we're kind of stymied.</LD>
<LD>   You know, back when I fought, there wasn't any question of who the
enemy was. You had two enemies: Germany and Japan.</LD>
<LD>   I was on the second floor of our home in Illinois the day of Pearl
Harbor, and I heard it on the radio and ran down to the basement
where my mother was. In that time war was imminent; Pearl Harbor was
just the event that triggered it.</LD>
<TE>   My brother and I ran out and joined the Marine Corps. I was in the
South Pacific for 2 1/2 years. We'd been raised to fight that war; it
was something we knew was going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   This type of warfare we're involved in now is entirely different.
Anything that happens from terrorism is different from saturation
bombings. It really is a bigger threat, because it's something you
just can't control. The world is such a vast place, so many billions
of people out there. And it could be any of them.</TE>
<TE>   You know, ever since World War II, America hasn't really been
loved by the rest of the world. I remember when my brother traveled
to Europe a few years ago. He could see there were a great deal of
people in the world that--well, we think that everybody loves
America, and that's not the case. It wasn't something that developed
overnight. This has been going on for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, nobody wants to be fearful, and the government shouldn't
try to make Americans fearful. I think they started to do that for a
while there, to scare people, and then I noticed they backed off a
bit. Terrorism is one of the things we just have to live with. And
America will survive."</TE>

<LD>Nelson Gracia-Cruz, 25, is a mortuary affairs specialist in the U.S.
Army Reserve. The Arecibo, Puerto Rico, native was sent to sift for
human remains in the rubble of the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "Nobody wants my job. Nobody.</LD>
<TE>   You go into the Army or the reserves or whatever, and most guys
are looking to get to the action. They want to be on a battlefield,
shooting bad guys, not searching for what's left of some poor soul
who didn't make it.</TE>
<TE>   Not me. When I joined the reserves, I was 17 and looking for the
safest Army job I could find, one with good benefits, a way out of my
life in Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   When I got the chance to join a unit whose mission is to find,
sort through and categorize the remains and personal effects of war
victims, I jumped at it. I knew no dead guy was going to get me.</TE>
<TE>   When the planes struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,
I'd been at it for seven years, spending most of my weekends
training, going to mortuaries, looking at corpses, searching through
contrived rubble for fake severed hands and stuff.</TE>
<TE>   I thought I'd seen it all.</TE>
<TE>   So there I was, in the north parking lot of the Pentagon five days
after the attacks. We'd come right from the plane. It was dark, maybe
9:30 at night.</TE>
<TE>   They put us right to work.</TE>
<TE>   I remember I was wearing my white Tyvex suit, my gloves, my mask.
The place was still smoking. The stench was horrible. You could smell
burning fuel and human flesh.</TE>
<TE>   I was sifting through a big pile of rubble that the guys with the
heavy equipment had pulled out of that huge, stinking scar in the
building. I reached into the pile, and the first thing I pulled out
was a finger. Not burned, not shredded. Just an entire finger that
used to belong to a human being.</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't stop shaking. I found a lot of horrible stuff
afterward. Skin, hair, bits of clothing. Baby pictures. Wedding
bands. A wooden Uncle Sam figurine. Last month, a guy came to claim
it. He saw a picture of it in one of the big books of pictures we've
made of every single thing we've found. Turns out his mom had made it
for him. He said everything else in his office had burned clear away.
He can't figure why that Uncle Sam came through that fire.</TE>
<TE>   I think about it every day. I used to think I was invincible. But
now I know better. I don't know where I'm going to be tomorrow. My
mom is my very best friend, and when she saw me on leave a few months
ago she said, 'Nelson, you've grown up.'</TE>
<TE>   She's not kidding. When those planes hit, I was planning to get
married in December to my fiancee, Rita. She wanted the whole wedding
thing--white dress, big celebration, lots of family. But after I'd
been digging up parts of dead people for a few weeks, I called her
up. I said, 'Let's just get married now. I could get sent to
Afghanistan tomorrow. I could die in a plane crash. I want you to be
my wife.'</TE>
<TE>   It was hard for her, but she knew I was right. She flew up. So did
my parents and her mom and dad. We were married here in the
courthouse in November.</TE>
<TE>   I joined the Army for good a few months after Sept. 11. When I
found out after the attacks that the Army has only about 300 guys in
the whole world trained to do what I do, I was shocked. That's just
not going to cut it if there's another attack or a full-blown war.
They really need me.</TE>
<TE>   I think it's going to work out all right for Rita and me. But I'm
not steel anymore. You know what I think about? I think about riding
to and from the Pentagon in the back of those trucks every day last
fall. Every day we drove past this gas station on a hill outside the
Pentagon where they had cordons set up.</TE>
<TE>   That's where the families kept watch. They had candles lit and
flags and signs, photos of the people who might be dead inside that
building. They stood there all day and all night, waiting for some
news. Whenever they saw us, they started clapping. I couldn't
understand it. I thought, I haven't done much, I'm just going through
this stuff, doing my job. But now, with our work almost at an end, I
feel differently. I think what we've done is almost like putting
together a puzzle. It's like completing a life. It's giving back a
wedding band to a wife or a piece of cloth to a daughter. It's not
much. But it's something."</TE>

<LD>Hood Qa'Im-maqami, 33, was on his way to his day job on Sept. 11, at
Lehman Bros. on the 40th floor of the north tower. That day's
devastation shook up his night job as well: He was one of the
nation's few active Middle Eastern comedians, mocking stereotypes by
playing Hood the Terrorist, complete with a belt of fake explosives.
One club canceled</LD>
<LD>   his appearances after the attacks,</LD>
<LD>   and even when he did perform,</LD>
<TE>   he took the stage without his favorite prop. The native of Iran,
who grew up in Encino and studied economic development at Harvard and
MIT, still has</TE>
<TE>   his day job a year later--except that the Lehman offices now are
in New Jersey. And his comedy act? Whereas he used to wear</TE>
<TE>   a gray T-shirt with faint lettering saying "Sandmonkey," his</TE>
<TE>   stage uniform now has a new message: "It Wasn't Me." But the
explosive belt is back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "There's a true story I use now in my act. I was at the grocery
store on July 4 of this year. With all the increased tension, people
thinking something's going to happen. I was looking for a steak, and
a white guy I've never met says, 'Happy Fourth of July--how long you
been in this country?' The true ending is, I didn't want to be
confrontational but wanted to teach him something about diversity, so
I lied and said I was born here. He said--and I'm not making this
up--'Good, that's the way it should be.'</TE>
<TE>   In the act now, I talk about what I might have said: 'How long?
Seven weeks. I'm here from Iraq--for flight school. Some parts
boring--like landing.' But I tell the audience I chickened out and
that I actually lied to him, 'You know, dude, I'm a Latino.' And just
to make the point I went and stole his car. And the audience buys it.
I get nervous laughter.</TE>
<TE>   I do this new joke about profiling and how I've gotten comfortable
with it. If I get on a plane and I see an Arab man on the plane, that
doesn't scare me. But if there's five Arab men and they're all
winking at each other then I'm thinkin': gay Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, there's a small group of three or four Middle
Eastern comics coming out of the woodwork, trying to play off what
happened. I joke about it onstage. A guy out in L.A. put together a
show with a Jewish comic, playing up how difficult it's been. So I
joke about doing benefits where it's an Arab and a Jew. I say, 'Other
people look at me performing at a synagogue as not really doing any
good in the world. I look at it as  ... reconnaissance.'</TE>
<TE>   As much as there is an agenda to this, it's to humanize us. But
there's no active proselytizing in the act, no active message of,
'We're humans, treat us the same.' That would be like, 'Let's all
snuggle up with kittens.' I don't do anything onstage that doesn't
have a punch line."</TE>

<LD>Peter Jennings, 64, anchor of ABC's "World News Tonight," was on the
air for 17 hours the day of the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "I was in the newsroom when it happened, when the first plane hit,
so I was steps--five feet--from the anchor desk. And I did what you
always do in a circumstance like that: You sit down, you plug in and
you begin to try to make sense of what is happening.</LD>
<TE>   I don't need to tell you how hugely difficult and important it was
for us to make sense of something that it was almost impossible to
make sense of.</TE>
<TE>   I've never looked at much of our coverage, but [Comedy Central's]
Jon Stewart and I did a thing together several months ago called
'Irreverence in the Age of Reverence.' They showed a little bit of
Jon's return to his broadcast and me on the day, which I hadn't seen
before. I realized how much at sea the whole country was, when I
found myself looking at myself watching the first building begin to
come down. And I had no idea what was happening.</TE>
<TE>   The building was halfway down before [correspondent] Don Dahler,
who was downtown, said, 'Peter, the whole building is going,' and I
said, 'The whole building?' That, as much as anything, is a reminder
to me of how difficult it was that day to get a real grasp of what
was happening.</TE>
<TE>   In some respects, I think that those of us who do what I do were
in a more fortunate position than other people. I've talked to
thousands of people since then and the overwhelming majority of
people were in some respects more affected by it in the early stages
than we were, because we were so focused on what was happening.</TE>
<TE>   Only once in the course of the day did I think, 'Oh, my God, I'm
going to lose it here.' My kids, one in California, one in
Massachusetts, called in just to see if I was OK, and I turned around
and there on the desk behind me was a message that Elizabeth and
Christopher had called. And I turned to the audience and said, 'You
must call your kids, get in touch with your children, we must all be
in touch with our children.' Ironically, that was hard, because it
was suddenly very, very personal.</TE>
<TE>   When 9/11 occurred, in the first couple days, it was impossible to
even get out of here. And then I couldn't get out to the rest of the
country for many, many, many weeks, because I wasn't allowed to go
anywhere for several months.</TE>
<TE>   [Later], when I got to California, I had dinner one night with the
two Browns, with [San Francisco Mayor] Willie and [Oakland Mayor]
Jerry and several businesspeople, and all they wanted to talk about
was the economy. And it was a real eye-opener and it helped me and
helped us and helped those of us who are editors make these
transitions back to covering other things."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 1:30 a.m. Sept. 11, then-New York Police Commissioner Bernard B.
Kerik finished writing what he thought would be the final chapter of
his autobiography. A few hours later, he was at headquarters working
at his massive desk--the same one Theodore Roosevelt used when he
headed the Police Department. Minutes later, aides rushed in and
shouted that a plane had hit the World Trade Center. Kerik looked out
a window, saw the huge hole in the north tower, jumped into a car
and, with siren wailing, headed for the vast complex only blocks
away.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "Two things I remember most about Sept. 11 a year later: The
people jumping from the buildings. I can remember watching the debris
fall to the ground. As the debris got closer to the ground, I
realized it wasn't debris. It was bodies. And they were jumping, one,
two, some three at a time.</LD>
<TE>   And then when Flight 175 hit [the south tower], I was underneath
it. I was at the base of [the north tower], and when the explosion
came through the north end of the building, I heard this cracking,
breaking sound, and then I saw the explosion itself.</TE>
<TE>   My schedule has changed. It is not as stressful as it was. [On]
Dec. 31, Mayor [Rudolph W. Giuliani] and I left. I am in a new
venture, working with him. But it is not the same being in civilian
life. I worked for [Giuliani] for nine years, and that's probably the
equivalent of 27 with anyone else because of his energy level.</TE>
<TE>   He's got this perpetual, tireless energy. He's still the boss. Now
I just don't get phone calls at 5:30 in the morning, at 2:30 in the
morning. It's a little different, but my life has changed pretty
dramatically in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   I am spending more time with my kids. My daughter Celine was a lot
younger then. She is almost 2 1/2 now. As police commissioner, I
missed almost everything. I missed her first steps, I missed her
first words, I didn't get to spend much time with her.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, there was no time, really. I lived in headquarters
for the first three weeks and then I moved back home. But I didn't
spend any time with my kids, my family, and that's all changed.</TE>
<TE>   If she is in a really good mood in the morning at 7 when I get up,
I wind up staying home until 9. We hang out, we play and we dance,
and we do a bunch of things I didn't get a chance to do before.</TE>
<TE>   Since the book was done, I got my final eight credits and
graduated from the State University of New York on June 5, and got a
[bachelor's degree] in public administration.</TE>
<TE>   I went to the graduation. It was a little odd, getting to speak
before the graduating class. What's ironic, this year I did eight
commencement speeches, six colleges and universities and two high
schools. And then I spoke at my graduation.</TE>
<TE>   I guess the thing I wanted to get across to them the most was
don't make this sort of your final dream, don't believe people when
they tell you they can't achieve anything in life.</TE>
<TE>   The president came as you know to ground zero a few days after
Sept. 11. He came down and met with the mayor and me. We all piled
into his truck, six of us in the back of his Suburban. I am not sure
if it was the governor, but somebody was sitting in his lap,
basically.</TE>
<TE>   We drove down to ground zero and people were cheering and yelling
and had signs--'We love New York,' 'We Love the President,' 'Bush
You're the Best'--and the president looks over at the mayor and says,
'Look at these people. There are thousands and thousands. It's
unbelievable.' And the mayor says, 'I hate to be the one to tell you
this, Mr. President, but not one of those people voted for you.'</TE>
<TE>   And the governor started laughing and [Giuliani] looked at the
governor and says, 'Only about four voted for you.'</TE>
<TE>   I never thought I'd see a day when the police commissioner or a
police car could drive in Greenwich Village and be cheered. It really
brought this city together, and it showed the best in people."</TE>

<LD>Sherry Lansing, 57, chairwoman of Paramount Pictures' Motion Picture
Group, is one of Hollywood's highest-ranking female executives.
Lansing, a former teacher, model and actress, is married to
Oscar-winning director William Friedkin ("The French Connection").</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "It's a day I will never forget. The only comparison I can think
of is the Kennedy assassination. I was just about to get up when my
husband woke me. He said, 'America is being attacked!' I can still
see him with this look of shock on his face. The television went on
and it never went off. I felt as if it couldn't possibly be
happening. The second plane came and we saw that in real time. There
was a surreal quality to it. I stayed glued to the television with my
family the whole day. The studio was closed. Nobody left the house.</LD>
<TE>   There was a period after the event when I felt fear; it was a fear
of going to a basketball game, or going to concerts, or going into
crowds. We put up security at the studio. It was just this kind of
unease and wondering what's next, what's going to happen, that I
remember, and then it passed.</TE>
<TE>   What is remarkable to me is our adaptability. The first week after
the attack, security at the studio would look in the trunk of your
car, ask for your ID, put a mirror under your car and other things.
It would be a reminder of the threat we were all under. But now, you
open your trunk and show them your badge and you don't think twice
about it. I am aware of the security, but I have gone back to my life
as before.</TE>
<TE>   There was something that happened in the weeks, or perhaps months,
afterward that has stayed with me. For a while, everybody had their
priorities in order. Everybody knew what was important. People became
kinder or gentler in our business. We became like a small town. There
were no big events, only small dinner parties. We learned that
intimacy and human contact are what's really important, being with
your loved ones, your kids, not being superficial. I have to say,
that was so wonderful. People were so vulnerable. That has stayed
with me, that desire to keep my priorities in order.</TE>
<TE>   The other thing I found in myself was a surge of patriotism--a
very emotional kind of patriotic feeling. We obviously put flags out
at our house after Sept. 11. Everyone did. But our flags are still
there. I was so proud to be an American. When I think about those
people on that plane, what those men and women did, the bravery of
the people, the bravery of the firemen and the policemen, I am in awe
of those people. They were truly heroic."</TE>

<LD>   There's a sadness that America doesn't always understand its
impact on other cultures or countries. I don't think that Americans
realize how dominating our culture can be around the world. I think
that a lot of people in the world have a sense of powerlessness, and
joining terrorist groups or gangs in the U.S. gives a sense of
belonging and control or power over the big guys, over what you
perceive as the enemy."</LD>

<LD>Carol Matyi, 61, a retired nurse from Irwin, Pa., was on her way home
from Italy when the terrorists struck. Her Sabena Airlines flight was
rerouted to St. John's, Canada.  It took Matyi nine days to get home.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "[The pilot] said we were going to have to change course. He
didn't give a reason. Nobody knew what was going on. Then he came
back on as we got closer to St. John's [and said] that there had been
an attack on the World Trade Center.</LD>
<TE>   They took us by bus to an ice hockey arena. The Red Cross was
there and all these volunteers from the town. There was food and
drink for us. They brought phones in, and we were able to try to
contact our families [who] didn't know where we were. I got through
to my son.</TE>
<TE>   We boarded another bus. I went to a high school. There were 550 of
us at this high school. People were on the gym floor. I slept in a
classroom on the gym mats.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Wednesday, there were people from town who came to
volunteer. You want to go sightseeing? You want to go whale-watching?
People said to me, 'I'm just so happy to be able to do something for
an American, because they were so good to us during World War II.'
That just made your heart burst.</TE>
<TE>   Three times, our flight was canceled. We finally got to leave
Tuesday evening. Believe me, when I got home, I was ready for my bed.</TE>
<TE>   After we started settling in [in St. John's], it was almost like
an extended vacation. The people were so wonderful. You always hear
that strangers never care. This was very enlightening."</TE>

<LD>Gopal Mitra, 66, a Calcutta architect inspired by his devout Hindu
faith, joined the team designing the World Trade Center in 1963 after
a chance meeting with the project's mastermind, Minoru Yamasaki. In
beautifully rendered pencil drawings, Mitra conceived the towers'
stainless steel skin, a self-supporting latticework engineered to
withstand 200-mile-per-hour winds, earthquakes--and an aircraft
strike.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "I used to work every day from 8 a.m. to 4 a.m. I would come home,
get a couple of hours' sleep and go back to the office. One day after
4 o'clock, when I came home and was preparing my coffee, I heard the
voice of the lord, my master, my spiritual guru Thakur Sitaram Das
Omkernath: 'My child, you seem to be so worried about the foundations
of a little building. Have you ever thought that that upon which you
are placing your foundations, Mother Earth, has no foundations,
floating in space?'</LD>
<TE>   We were building the tallest structure on Earth and imagine, our
work was insignificant: 110 stories. Dust compared to the Earth
floating in space! And we were racking our brains.</TE>
<TE>   I was working in my office in the evening of Sept. 11. G.S.
Sanyal, a senior barrister at the Calcutta high court and a good
friend of mine, telephoned me and said, 'The World Trade Center is
under attack.' I told him point blank: 'Nothing can happen to it.'
Then again he telephoned me and said, 'Please come and see,' because
he knows I don't watch TV.</TE>
<TE>   So I went around 9 at night and saw two scenes: One was the first
plane hitting, and I was confident nothing would happen to the
building. With about a 250-ton load, and that enormous velocity, a
several-thousand-ton impact-moment was generated, and the building
did not shudder. In a normal case, the building would have been blown
over.</TE>
<TE>   In the second scene, I saw the enormous eruption of that volcano
of exploding fuel. In the face of that volcano, no fire system could
work because everything was turned to ashes. It was an inferno
inside. It created a blast furnace and melted the steel. That is why
it collapsed. The impact was nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Lord Krishna says, 'I am the Creator. Everything flows from me.'
To give us some pleasure, he, through us, created that simplicity of
the World Trade Center. It is his creation. None of us should take
any credit for it. None of us should take any credit for these sheer
towers of beauty. It is the work of the master himself. He created
it, he destroyed it. I give no importance to that. In his words, this
is nothing. There is nothing called death, only the change of bodies.
The soul is indestructible.</TE>
<TE>   Those gleaming two towers of the World Trade Center will remain in
everyone's memory. So pure. So simple."</TE>

<LD>Tirsa Moya, 35, is a customer service manager for a small insurance
brokerage firm. She guided 81-year-old Raphael Cava down 89 flights
of the north tower of the World Trade Center. They escaped five
minutes before the building collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "Raphael always refers to me as his angel, but I see it the other
way around. I think he was put in my path to keep me distracted and
from worrying about my own safety that day.</LD>
<TE>   I only knew him before</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 to say hello in the morning. But my boss found him in the
hallway disoriented and brought him into our office. The minute he
came in, I just took over. We were stuck there for 40 minutes before
[Port Authority Officer Pablo Ortiz] broke down the stairwell door
and we went down.</TE>
<TE>   I had to force Raphael quite a few times to stop, catch his
breath. But he wouldn't. He wouldn't take off his jacket. He wouldn't
take off his hat. As hot as it was, he just wanted to keep going. It
took us almost an hour to get down. When we got to the lobby, it was
like being in a war zone. There was a lot of debris from the south
tower that had already collapsed and so people guiding us out would
tell us two or three at a time, 'Run, run, take cover, take cover.'</TE>
<TE>   Raphael and I were separated briefly, but he waited for me. We
crossed the Brooklyn Bridge together and I stayed with him until
somebody came to pick him up about 4:30, and then I went home to
Queens and spent the next five hours on the phone telling people I
was fine.</TE>
<TE>   We talked every day after Sept. 11 until I got back to work. Then
every two weeks or so, I would go over to [his new office] to say
hello. Since April, I haven't seen him, but we speak every other
week. There isn't much conversation. It's just checking in, that's
all.</TE>
<TE>   I don't remember any faces from that day. I still have a lot of
blanks. When I talk about it to other people, basically, I try to get
across what a peaceful descent it was.</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning, I didn't want to talk about it at all or watch
or listen to anything related to 9/11. I was in a little cocoon. I
didn't break down or get emotional. It took me a long time to cry.</TE>
<TE>   For a long time, airplanes and the smell of smoke and fire engines
got to me. I live near Kennedy airport, so the planes are constantly
overhead. Even to this day, the train station where I get out at is
outdoors and the airplanes fly pretty low and sometimes I do get the
urge to run and take shelter.</TE>
<TE>   I'd say the first few weeks I also had a hard time sleeping. I
wasn't having nightmares, not that I remember. That's when I actually
picked up drinking coffee again. I've also put on at least 10 pounds.
I guess over the last year I have been totally out of control,
totally disorganized, shopping a lot, buying, buying, buying without
hesitation, eating what I want. I felt like I had no control over my
life for a while. I tend to be forgetful anyway, but sometimes I
couldn't remember what I had for breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   We were also very busy in the office trying to reconstruct
everything we'd lost. We had no paperwork, no documentation, no
files. And whatever we were reconstructing had to be from memory and
a lot of us, well, our memories were shot.</TE>
<TE>   I finally came back downtown in January. I just had this immense
urge to go to ground zero and see what my reaction would be. I had
invited a friend who also had made it out of the 89th floor, but she
was too busy. So I went alone and that's when I had a really good
cry.</TE>
<TE>   The one thing that annoyed me were all the tourists. I'm here
boo-hooing and these people are speculating on what happened and what
should be built there. I just wanted to say, "Shut up and go home." I
don't understand why they bug me.</TE>
<TE>   Then on April 18, our offices moved back downtown and it felt like
I was coming home. I'm a lot happier now than I was before Sept. 11.
We can either be in a cheerful mood, or be in a bad mood every day. I
choose to be happy. I take a lot more chances now. In the past, I
used to be very cautious and analyze everything to death. I find I'm
a lot more open to experiencing new things.</TE>
<TE>   I had always been petrified of speed, for example, but then this
summer someone invited me for a ride on a motorcycle and I thought,
'What the hell, if I don't like it I'll never do it again.' So I did.</TE>
<TE>   I lost my mom at 7 and I don't remember mourning at the time.
Earlier this year, I don't remember when, but I felt myself mourning
her for the first time. I cried and felt sad for a few days and that
was it. It's like I had closure, but I never associated it with 9/11.
It was just something that came over me. Weird.</TE>
<TE>   Another weird thing is when we were at the World Trade Center, my
co-workers and I, being that we work for a Japanese-owned company,
always had a Japanese caterer bring in six selections for lunch. I
just got hooked on salmon. I would eat it practically every day, and
my co-workers would always goof on me and say, 'We're not even going
to ask you what you're having because we already know.'</TE>
<TE>   But after Sept. 11, I couldn't touch the stuff, probably because I
associated it with being at the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Then a month and a half ago I started eating salmon again.</TE>
<TE>   Guess what I had today for lunch?</TE>
<TE>   Salmon and a salad."</TE>

<LD>Leo Mullin, 59, is chief executive of Delta Air Lines. With top
executives at American and United stricken by having lost passengers
and crew members in the attacks, Mullin was thrust into the spotlight
as the voice of the airline industry as it begged Washington
officials for a bailout.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "We immediately heard speculation that one of the airplanes might
have been a Delta plane. My wife happened to be going into New York
at just that time [on a Delta flight] for a meeting. I thought, 'Oh,
my God.' I just stopped for a moment and thought, 'Could this be?'
[But] her plane had been diverted to Allentown, Pa.</LD>
<TE>   By Thursday or Friday [after the attacks], it had begun to dawn on
us that this was going to have enormous financial consequences on the
airlines. The airline CEOs went to the White House on Tuesday, and
afterward, American Airlines CEO Don Carty pulled me off to the side.
He said Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta wants someone to speak
for the industry, [and] 'Can you handle it?' He never told me exactly
why.</TE>
<TE>   Mineta then said, 'We're going to step out of the White House and
make some comments [to the media] and you'll be asked to say
something.' I will never forget it--a huge bank of television cameras
and microphones. It was something right out of the movies.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later when the job cuts were made, I made the
announcement in three different places that day, before about 500
people each. At all three places, I got a standing ovation."</TE>

<LD>Karla Olivos, a 22-year-old international business major, is one of
thousands of Mexicans who cross the border legally each day to work
or study in the United States. She drives from her father's home in
Tijuana to San Diego State University, a commute that used to require
half an hour. On Sept. 11, it took all morning. The border was closed
briefly, then reopened with severely tightened U.S. inspections that
remain in force. It was the start of an ordeal that has caused Olivos
to spend more hours at the wheel than in class and has fragmented her
bilingual, bicultural world.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "At the border that morning, they were asking everyone to get out
of their cars. They were checking the trunks. They were opening the
hoods. They were even putting in dogs to inspect the cars. I was
like, 'Wait a second, I have to get to class!' They asked me
everything, like what is the name of the president of my school. I
was shocked. I thought, 'What does this have to do with me?'</LD>
<TE>   After that day, I would drive to the border before 6, but
sometimes that wasn't early enough to get to a 10 a.m. class. Some
days I would start out at 3 or 4. It got insane. People had to start
lining up at 1 and 2 a.m. or lose their jobs in California. I would
sit at the wheel and do homework. I'd read my book and highlight.
Then every couple of minutes I'd move forward a meter or two.</TE>
<TE>   I really, really got to hate it, crossing the border.</TE>
<TE>   Once I asked one of the border officers, 'How long is this going
to take? You know, I don't know if you realize that, if there's any
terrorists, he or she or they are not going to cross in a car, not
where a lot of people are watching.'</TE>
<TE>   He told me, 'Well, you know, we're doing our job and I don't like
it either, but that's the way it's going to be until who knows when.'</TE>
<TE>   I know they are trying to protect their country. But it's people
like me, students and people who have to work, who are paying. In
Tijuana, people don't say, 'We're with the U.S. because of what
happened.' They're just frustrated with the wait.</TE>
<TE>   I'm astonished at how my Mexican American friends see things.
Before</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11, if you asked them, 'What are you?' they would say
'Mexican,' even though they were born in America. Now they say,
'Gosh, they hit us, and we are America. We love America.' They even
wave American flags.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, I was telling my friend, 'Americans are so racist,
because if people come to visit from Libya, Iran or Iraq, they have
to be fingerprinted. Imagine, how would you feel?' She's Mexican
American, and she said, 'Well, they have to pay for supporting
terrorists.' And I said, 'How do you know who they're supporting?'</TE>
<TE>   I don't feel hate for America. But sometimes I just don't get it.
The close relationship between these two cities can't be cut off just
like that.</TE>
<TE>   When I graduate, I hope to get a practical training permit to work
in San Diego. But right now, the economy is so bad, and since Sept.
11 employers are reluctant to hire international people. I am really
worried. All my Mexican friends who graduated in my program a year
ago found work right away. Of my six Mexican friends who graduated
last May, none has a job."</TE>

<LD>Kate Houlihan Poole, 29, works for a financial information company in
New York. She was working for another company Sept. 11 at the World
Trade Center and was looking forward to her wedding. She was dropping
off film at the center's mall level when an airplane struck the north
tower. She and her husband will celebrate their anniversary Sept. 22.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "That morning, I was writing my name on the film envelope when I
heard a noise so loud it made me duck.</LD>
<TE>   I looked around and saw a policeman helping a security guard
covered in dust and bleeding from his head. The policeman said a
plane just hit the tower. I thought he meant something small, like a
Cessna. I continued on my way to [the south tower]--through the
mall--and was just about to reach the elevator when another security
person said, 'I think you should leave the building.' I started to go
out one doorway, but they had closed it. That was the side of the
building that the plane had hit. So I went back out through the
subway, another thing that totally changed the course of my day.
There is also an escalator, and if I had gone up, I would have been
right in the middle of the World Trade Center. Instead, I came up two
blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   I was walking down Church Street toward the World Trade Center,
thinking I at least need to find out where everybody from my office
is. [When the second building got hit], I ran with everybody else out
into the middle of Broadway, and then I went into City Hall Park.
That's when I could see that it was the second tower that had gotten
hit--the second tower where my office was, on the 58th floor. So now
I am a complete mess. By this time, I also realized that my cell
phone was not going to work. So I eventually found a pay phone and
called my fiance and told him I was OK.</TE>
<TE>   Just north of Union Square, I found a cab that was off duty. I
told the driver, I'll pay you 50 bucks to take me to 52nd Street. At
this point I was crying again, so he calmed me down and got me
Kleenex, and made me sit in the front seat. It was over the course of
this cab ride that the two buildings collapsed. We were on Park
Avenue, listening to the radio. The driver's name was Eddie. He said
he was a Muslim. He told me he was from Pakistan. He said, 'I don't
know who is responsible for this, but I bet it has something to do
with my people.'</TE>
<TE>   When we got to [my fiance's] building, I tried to pay him. He
said, 'No, no, no.'</TE>
<TE>   [Later], I got my film back. A friend saw an article that said the
contents of the film lab had been transferred to the Port Authority.
I went to claim it and got back a very dusty envelope. I still have
it. Those pictures had a very eerie journey. So did I, and so did our
country."</TE>

<LD>Arnold Shapiro, 58, won an Emmy and Oscar for the documentary "Scared
Straight!" which chronicled a program in which youthful offenders
were taken to prison and introduced to hardened convicts. After a
variety of similar programs through his career, Shapiro agreed last
summer to produce the second installment of the CBS series "Big
Brother," a prime-time elimination game that sequesters people in a
house for three months, with the winner earning $500,000. When Sept.
11 happened, the show was 10 days from its conclusion and three
contestants remained. One of them, Monica Bailey, had a cousin who
worked in the World Trade Center, prompting a flurry of activity over
whether she should be notified. Shapiro is again producing this
summer's edition of the show.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "That morning, we were of course consumed with this world tragedy
that occurred, wondering what would happen next.</LD>
<TE>   After we got over that, we got a phone call saying that Monica's
cousin in the World Trade Center had gone to work that day. It
quickly became evident that Monica's cousin, who was like a sister to
her, was there and was missing.</TE>
<TE>   We made a decision, with CBS and the production company, Endemol,
that we would call the three 'house guests' in and tell them basic
information about what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Before we decided, every conceivable question was asked. Should we
end the show and let them walk out that day? Should we call it a draw
and let them split the money equally? It was all raised and rejected.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet, of course, was abuzz with opinions, which ranged
from 'How could you do that?' by continuing the show to 'Why did you
break the rules of the game?' You just have to ignore that. It's like
being a politician.</TE>
<TE>   We told Monica and gave her the option of staying or leaving the
house. She compartmentalized it and got on with the game. When she
came out, we told her we didn't know any more and that her cousin had
probably perished.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, everyone was upset, but our focus had to go from our
own personal grieving to our responsibility to these house guests,
primarily Monica. These people on the show are in our care, in our
protection.</TE>
<TE>   You're dealing with our generation's Pearl Harbor, and at the same
time, you have to focus on doing your job. No matter what course of
action we took, someone was going to feel it's inappropriate."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stefano Dambruoso, 40, is a top anti-terrorism prosecutor in Milan,
Italy. In 2000, he began investigating a Milan cell involved in
recruitment and logistical support for Al Qaeda in Europe and
Afghanistan. The case accelerated after Sept. 11, resulting this year
in the first convictions in Europe of Al Qaeda members since the
attacks in the United States. Before starting the Milan
counter-terrorism job six years ago, Dambruoso spent five years in
Sicily prosecuting the Mafia.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "Before Sept. 11, we knew about Al Qaeda from our investigation of
the Milan cell, from the media and the secret services. But mainly
what I worried about was an attack in Europe with bombs against
either monuments or airplanes. I was most worried about a symbolic
attack against monuments. I didn't want to think about attacks
against people like hijackings or bombs on airplanes.</LD>
<TE>   I was very affected because I know the United States. I lived in
Los Angeles for eight months. I studied at Santa Monica College.</TE>
<TE>   It was hard for me psychologically to connect Sept. 11 to our
suspects in Milan. It seemed too far away. We had not delved deep
enough to understand what we understand now: Al Qaeda is an
organization that has to be seen in its entirety, not in separate
little parts.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, we didn't have an understanding of the global danger of
the organization. We didn't understand that even a small thing in our
territory was dangerous because it could help, one way or another, an
operation like Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In December, I was awakened by a phone call at midnight: The
police told me that the next day, there would be extra security in
front of my home. A tip had come from the Italian intelligence
services. An informant in the Middle East said a group of Algerians
was preparing an attack on a prosecutor in Italy who was
investigating Islamic terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The main danger in Europe today, I think, is the high probability
of someone carrying out an attack as part of a personal jihad. That
is the hardest thing to intercept. If a network is organizing a big
attack, it takes time. Hopefully, there's a period when we can have
some luck and stop them. But with an individual, one or two people,
it's harder.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the problem of balancing public security with
integration of immigrants. Arabs in Europe feel they are more
discriminated against since Sept. 11. In certain ways, it's true. You
have people saying all Arabs are terrorists. If you keep telling a
tolerant Muslim that he is a terrorist, you could have a reaction. He
could end up becoming a terrorist. It's a vicious circle."</TE>

<LD>Vanessa Carruthers, 22, began her career as a teacher at Lynwood's
Washington Elementary School on Sept. 4, 2001. On her fifth day, she
tried to explain terrorism, war and death to nearly three dozen
fourth-graders.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "My students knew what had happened, but they didn't really know
what was going on. They were asking all types of questions. They were
like, 'Did you see the buildings? They blew up!' They were excited
about the explosion because they're little kids. They said: 'They
fell, Miss Carruthers! They fell! How many people were killed? And
who did it? And if we find out who did it, can we do it back to
them?' I didn't have answers for them. I just felt hopeless.</LD>
<TE>   That whole day, I had the radio on and off. I didn't want them to
hear every single thing. We did a little bit of work. I had them do
some spelling words and definitions. I played music too, so they
wouldn't worry. I didn't want them to panic.</TE>
<TE>   Anything I tell them, they take to heart. So I knew it was a
delicate situation. What can they understand? What should they know?
What should I tell them? The next day I didn't tell them anything
about what I felt or thought. I told them to tell me how they thought
or felt. We spent a lot of the day listening to each other.</TE>
<TE>   I think this made me a better teacher. It just changed a lot of
things for me--my whole perspective, my outlook on life, the whole
thing about wanting to be successful, wanting to make a lot of money.
It doesn't really matter in the end."</TE>

<HD>For Many Muslims, Bin Laden Remains a Scapegoat of U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL and MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>Few people in the Muslim world have more reason to share America's
conviction that Osama bin Laden masterminded the Sept. 11 attacks on
the United States than Egyptian journalist Sakina Sadat.</LD>
<LD>   Her brother, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, was assassinated by
Islamic extremists 21 years ago. Bin Laden's second in command, Ayman
Zawahiri, was a member of the organization that killed him. Sadat has
an American son-in-law, a daughter who lives in Los Angeles, a
pragmatic mind and a worldly outlook.</LD>
<LD>   She also believes that Bin Laden had nothing to do with the Sept.
11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "He's a killer who wants to rule the Islamic world, but he doesn't
have the mind to do this," she said. "He can send people with machine
guns to kill, to destroy, to burn, but not to direct these three
airplanes with pilots to destroy those buildings with a precision
that requires milliseconds."</TE>
<TE>   Much as the O.J. Simpson trial exposed the divide that separated
white and black Americans in the mid-1990s, the accusations against
Bin Laden bring sharply divergent views of the world into focus. For
most Americans, and many of their allies, there is little doubt of
Bin Laden's guilt. But from much of the Muslim world, the U.S.
campaign against him often seems vengeful and anti-Islamic.</TE>
<TE>   The differences reflect an enormous gulf of suspicion between the
United States and Muslim societies, even at the upper echelons. Those
who have followed his actions say that's exactly what Bin Laden had
in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "The implications are serious," said Rasul Bakhsh Rais, a
respected political scientist at the Quaid-i-Azam University in
Islamabad, Pakistan, and one of the few interviewed for this article
who believes that Bin Laden did, in fact, mastermind the Sept. 11
attacks. "His agenda is to damage relations between Islam and the
West, and he has succeeded in ways few really understand."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts, both in the West and in Islamic countries, suggest that
America's inability to convince Muslims of Bin Laden's guilt has
helped sustain sympathy for him and may even have helped keep the Al
Qaeda terrorist network from disintegrating under the force of
relentless U.S. military pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "No terrorist group in history has taken the pounding that Al
Qaeda has, but it still operates," noted Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism
specialist at the Rand Corp.'s Washington office. "It still
circulates videos for recruiting, provides film to [Arab TV network]
Al Jazeera and invites people to Pakistan and Afghanistan. The
sympathy they get matters."</TE>
<TE>   The sharply differing assessments of Bin Laden's involvement in
the Sept. 11 attacks are also likely to complicate efforts to build
new bridges across the cultural divide.</TE>
<TE>   The belief in Bin Laden's innocence extends far beyond the
working-class slums and fundamentalist mosques that serve as some of
radical Islam's prime recruiting areas. It is also found in the quiet
parlors of educated, intellectual elites--from Cairo and Islamabad to
Kuala Lumpur.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of us--including me--were perturbed and perplexed that,
within hours [of the attacks], the blame was put on Osama bin Laden,"
Malaysian social scientist Chandra Muzaffar said in an interview.
"The evidence available is not persuasive enough to convince people.
That leads us to believe there's something else here."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear just how and why opinions over Bin Laden's
complicity are so divergent and remain so deeply rooted, but there
are several theories.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman said many extremist groups in the Muslim world now operate
well-oiled propaganda machines. He cited Lebanon-based Hezbollah,
which he said operates its own TV network as well as Web sites in
French, English and Arabic. In Bin Laden's own Al Qaeda, one of the
four main committees is devoted to communications, Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department gradually scaled back its own propaganda arm,
the United States Information Service, after the end of the Cold War.
As a result, Hoffman said, the U.S. is now outgunned in the battle
for public opinion in the Muslim world.</TE>
<TE>   "They've elbowed their way into the sweet spot, and we're playing
catch-up," he said. "The message of these militant groups is simple
and repetitive, and there's nothing to do to defend against it."</TE>
<TE>   But other factors are at work too.</TE>
<TE>   America's overall dearth of credibility in the Muslim world, in
part a result of its support of Israel, and the swiftness with which
Bin Laden was identified as the main suspect sowed doubt among many.</TE>
<TE>   Many in Muslim countries also find it hard to understand how the
most technologically advanced nation in the world could fail to react
while such an attack unfolded over a period of more than two hours.
Some have concluded that, much like the Oklahoma City bombing six
years earlier, the attacks on New York and Washington were carried
out by Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 are also perceived in Muslim nations
through the prism of deep feelings that long ago shaped people's view
of themselves and the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mixture of inferiority, people saying: 'We Arabs can't do
it. We are so weak, we are so ignorant,' " said Abdul Moneim Said,
director of the Cairo-based Al Ahram Center for Political and
Strategic Studies, a government-funded think tank. "Others say we are
so superior that our religion doesn't allow us to do this ... to kill
people.</TE>
<TE>   "You get it from both sides," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Edward S. Walker Jr., a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Egypt
and the United Arab Emirates and currently president of the Middle
East Institute in Washington, observed: "Nobody likes to admit your
religion is capable of that kind of atrocity. There is abhorrence and
denial."</TE>
<TE>   Walker also notes something else at play: a sense in many parts of
the Muslim world that the Bush administration's decision to identify
Bin Laden so quickly was one more example of a powerful anti-Islamic
prejudice.</TE>
<TE>   He illustrated this mind-set with a joke making the rounds in
Cairo: A young man, after jumping out of a crowd in New York City to
rescue a child being mauled by a dog, is told by a reporter that he
will be described as a hero in the next day's paper.</TE>
<TE>   "The headline will read, 'New York Man Saves Boy,' " the reporter
says, only to be informed that the man is not from New York. "Then it
will read, 'American Hero Saves Boy,' " the journalist goes on, but
he is again corrected. The hero, he is told, is from Pakistan. That
results in a different kind of headline: "Islamic Fundamentalist
Strangles Puppy."</TE>
<TE>   Even evidence accepted in the West as unassailable proof of Bin
Laden's complicity is viewed skeptically. For example, videotape of
Bin Laden discussing his involvement in the attacks has been rejected
as suspect by Islamic scholars.</TE>
<TE>   Khurshid Ahmad, a former senator in Pakistan's parliament and head
of the Islamabad-based Institute of Policy Studies, questioned the
tape's veracity in a carefully written critique that has been widely
circulated among Muslim intellectuals.</TE>
<TE>   "After carefully seeing and listening to the video on CNN for an
hour, one remains as confused, uninformed and unenlightened as ever
before," he concluded.</TE>
<TE>   In such an environment, the release by Al Jazeera this week of new
tapes that include some of the Sept. 11 hijackers, a claim of
responsibility for the attacks and a voice that the broadcaster says
is Bin Laden's would appear unlikely to change many minds. The
phenomenon is too complex for that.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that in some Muslim areas, there is evidence of at
least a partial shift of opinion. Within Britain's large Muslim
community, for example, the radical Al Muhajiroun movement says it
now accepts documentary evidence of Al Qaeda's involvement after
initially labeling the attack an American-Israel conspiracy. Normally
outspoken religious conservatives in Malaysia have also stopped
professing Bin Laden's innocence, but such developments remain at the
margins.</TE>
<TE>   The result of all this is a plethora of theories, many of them
conspiratorial. Sadat said during a recent lunch with reporters in
Hong Kong that she believes the attacks were the work of Americans
disaffected with their new president, George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "No one else could have the sophistication to do it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   While many fundamentalists in Egypt do tend to credit Bin Laden
with instigating the attack, mainstream opinion does not.</TE>
<TE>   Amr Waked, 30, an economist and financial analyst who graduated
from the American University in Cairo, recalled that more than half
the Americans who voted in the 2000 presidential election chose
someone other than Bush. "In my opinion, one of those 50% did it," he
said. "No one in the world gained anything from this but the
Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the wildest explanation that spread through the Muslim
world in the days after the attacks was that they had been the work
of Israeli intelligence, which had managed to secretly warn 4,000
Jews to stay home from work on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In the Muslim majority region of the southern Philippines, the
influential religious leader Ali Yacub, who teaches at Western
Mindanao University in Zamboanga, pointed the finger at what he
termed unspecified militants, then added, "Nothing will convince me
that Osama was behind the World Trade Center attacks except Osama
himself."</TE>
<TE>   The collective impact of militant propaganda and the rejection of
Bin Laden's guilt by many respected intellectuals have also helped
nurture his image on the streets as a brave man fighting for good in
an evil, American-dominated world.</TE>
<TE>   "He's my hero," said Budi Prasetyo, a 27-year-old office worker
employed by an American company in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
"He's a symbol of resistance against tyranny."</TE>

<HD>World-Class Pianist Forges a Link for Peace in Mideast</HD>
<DH>Culture: The Israeli Daniel Barenboim braves critics to
play for West Bank students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Daniel Barenboim said he came here Tuesday to play music, not
politics, as if such a thing was possible for an Israeli citizen
venturing into the heart of the occupied West Bank.</LD>
<LD>   At least for one 15-year-old Palestinian girl, he clearly
succeeded in reaching across the divide.</LD>
<LD>   Barenboim, the acclaimed pianist and conductor who shocked an
Israeli audience last year by conducting Wagner in Jerusalem, came to
Ramallah to fulfill a promise he had made in March. He had planned to
perform in the West Bank city then but was forced to cancel because
Israeli military authorities said they could not guarantee his
safety.</LD>
<TE>   They still couldn't, or wouldn't, Tuesday. Barenboim had to break
the Israeli military's rules to get to his noon concert at the
Quaker-run Ramallah Friends Schools, a century-old oasis of flowers
and calm amid the dust and rubble that is Ramallah in the aftermath
of Israel's incursion this year.</TE>
<TE>   Slipping through a military checkpoint in a German consular
vehicle--the West Bank is closed to ordinary Israelis but open to
diplomats--Barenboim made his way over rutted roads to the school,
arriving to the cheers of about 200 uniformed, scrubbed and eager
seventh-through 12th-graders.</TE>
<TE>   For these children, the sight of an Israeli without a gun was a
novelty.</TE>
<TE>   "We hate them," volunteered 12-year-old Dalina Kashou, who said
she could not imagine a day when Israelis and Palestinians would live
side by side in peace.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials and school administrators were grateful to
Barenboim for what they said was an act of great symbolism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important for a musician of his stature to give a
message to Israelis that Palestinians are people who appreciate--just
like anybody else--music and culture and are entitled to a life for
their children," said Gabi Baramki with the Palestinian Authority's
Higher Education Ministry, who was in the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Barenboim, 59, a Jew who was born in Argentina but grew up in
Israel, took the stage without a word and launched into Beethoven's
"Moonlight" Sonata. When he finished, and the standing, shouting and
whistling ovation had subsided, Barenboim spoke.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you speak English?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes!" yelled the students.</TE>
<TE>   After a brief salutation in Arabic, the pianist continued in
English about his purpose in defying the Israeli travel ban.</TE>
<TE>   "I think each of us has a responsibility to do what we think is
right," he told the students. "And what I can do is play music.... By
these few moments, maybe we can build down the hatred."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last several years, Barenboim has developed a friendship
with Palestinian writer Edward Said that led him to perform in
Ramallah in 1999, before the current Palestinian uprising. That has
not endeared him to some Israelis; neither did his decision to play
the prelude to Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde" at the Israel Festival
in July 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner's anti-Semitism and associations with Nazi Germany have
made his music unwelcome in Israel since the nation's founding in
1948. Barenboim, who is chief conductor of the Berliner Staatsoper,
had argued that the composition is an important work that should be
heard in a democratic society.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Jerusalem Post published a commentary attacking
Barenboim for saying recently that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon, "in spite of his love of music," would not be a welcome guest
at his concerts because of his policies toward the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The maestro's latest appearance in Ramallah seemed certain to
engender fresh attacks. Within hours of his appearance, the Israel
Defense Forces had issued a statement saying that Barenboim's visit
had been unauthorized and illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Moshe Fogel, a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Culture,
Science and Sports, said the government had no objection to
Barenboim's performing in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything, it's a wonderful initiative," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Fogel added: "We're all for activities on the Palestinian
side that would promote the cultural life. But at the same time, we
don't forget what they're doing in terms of promoting terror and what
it does to our cultural life."</TE>
<TE>   After his brief performance, Barenboim invited students to sit
next to him and play. Three girls took him up on the offer,
delighting both the performer and their classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Second among them was 15-year-old Nadia Avouri, who attacked a
piece by Mendelssohn with confidence and passion. A lanky,
dark-haired girl with a poise that seemed greater than her years, she
came up to Barenboim later to ask him for an autograph.</TE>
<TE>   "She played very well," he told a group of reporters as Nadia
beamed. "She will continue playing better because"--and here he
looked at her pointedly--"she will continue practicing."</TE>
<TE>   "I will," she promised.</TE>
<TE>   Nadia said the last two years have been terrible for her, as for
most Palestinians and Israelis. She had been a swimming champion in
her age group, she said, but had to abandon the sport because she
could no longer get to an indoor pool in Jerusalem. Her music has
suffered too, with local suppliers unable to get copies of scores and
her school unable to offer a music exam she needs to pass so she can
advance.</TE>
<TE>   She spoke bitterly about the Israelis: "They are trying in every
way to erase our existence as a nation." But she spoke glowingly
about Barenboim, whose scampering finger work had left her in awe.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a brave decision," she said of his visit.</TE>
<TE>   "Music breaks all barriers," she said. "I don't look at him as a
Jewish person or an Israeli person. I look at him as a musician."</TE>

<HD>Hope in a Russian Haystack</HD>
<DH>To locals preoccupied with survival, a former Muscovite's
artful towers of twigs or wood or snow are either madness or
inspiration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NIKOLA-LENIVETS, Russia</DL>
<LD>In this dying village, people don't carve out a living. They scrape
it with their nails from the soil.</LD>
<LD>   For the old women who have to chop their own kindling and the
lonely widows who shed tears at giving their last cow up to the
butcher, what use is art?</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen years ago, artist Nikolai Polissky came to this village
from Moscow, burning with creativity. He built armies of snowmen and
whimsical towers out of hay, or firewood or twigs, whatever was lying
around.</LD>
<TE>   To some villagers, he's a madman, the spark for a bonfire of
resentment. To others, he's an inspiration who showed them the beauty
of art in a place devoid of opportunity or hope.</TE>
<TE>   Radiantly impractical, the towers irritate some locals, who
grumble that they create a nuisance. Residents are too busy
struggling at the grinding business of survival to shuffle the few
hundred yards from their homes to gaze and wonder what the
constructions signify.</TE>
<TE>   That someone would pay a Paris gallery $2,000 for a photograph of
one of these confections is far beyond the locals' understanding, and
only serves to reinforce a sense of heartless lunacy in a market that
values people like them at nothing.</TE>
<TE>   But other villagers, who at first couldn't see the point of
Polissky's works, now are moved by their majesty, ablaze with
twinkling light on a purple moonlit night.</TE>
<TE>   "The funny thing is, they talk and say: 'What's the point? Why do
we need this?' " said Ivan Parygin, 17, one of the many locals drawn
like moths to Polissky's light. "But when they come down and see it,
you can see their eyes shining."</TE>
<TE>   Standing at the top of Polissky's latest creation, a 90-foot tower
of twigs and branches that sways and creaks in any gust of wind, it
is at first a little difficult to catch a sense of his artistic
vision.</TE>
<TE>   The whole thing is hammered up with a properly artistic sense of
haphazard asymmetry, a structure so untouched by safety
considerations that it makes your feet tingle as you clamber up on
slippery birch branches and rustic, homemade ladders.</TE>
<TE>   The reward up top is a splendid view, if you can forget for a
moment what lies beneath your soles.</TE>
<TE>   The giant basket-weave structure might recall the ethereal 1922
Shukhovskaya radio tower--pride of the Soviet Union--that inspired
it. To some, it's a rocket. It even conjures up elements of the
Eiffel Tower.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great when people move inside the tower. You can't see them,
but it creaks and groans and you can sense they are there," Polissky
burbled excitedly.</TE>
<TE>   But the construction is not quite finished yet. Polissky's team of
builders began in June, and by late this month it will be complete.
Then Polissky will take out his camera. He has a talent for lighting
and photographing his creations, capturing the sunlight, the dawn
mists, frost and snow that nature's charity adds.</TE>
<TE>   "The snow will come. When there is a thaw followed by a cold snap,
the tower will be covered in ice," he said. "It will look beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   A Squatter in</TE>
<TE>   Midst of Villagers</TE>
<TE>   Polissky, who devoted himself to painting, and a few close friends
first arrived here from Moscow, 125 miles away, in 1989 and squatted
on the land.</TE>
<TE>   "The land was like a mysterious island, and we felt we had to
build something unusual," he said. "We wanted to make something
monumental."</TE>
<TE>   They faced hostility.</TE>
<TE>   "The locals did not take to us," Polissky recalled. "There's a
traditional Russian fear of strangers. There was quite a bit of
aggression toward us. They were against us as Muscovites. But that
was a long time ago."</TE>
<TE>   After a dormant period, when he did little painting, Polissky
understood he had failed to find the new, vital direction in painting
that he craved.</TE>
<TE>   He is a onetime "Mityok," one of the leaders of an art movement
famous in the mid-1980s for rejecting socialism and finding artistic
inspiration not by opposition but by a devil-may-care lifestyle of
permanent, joyful inebriation.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a reputation as being people who knew how to live. But
either you die a heroic death as an alcoholic or you get on the
wagon," said Polissky, who never embraced the port wine breakfasts of
others in the group.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, he put aside his oils and brushes, inspired by new
materials that were free or cheap and widely available: snow, hay and
wood.</TE>
<TE>   Enlisting villagers, he created 220 snowmen, with carrot noses and
bucket helmets, straggling down a slope. He made a structure of hay
prosaically named "The Tower" that resembled a great golden spiral
shell, inspired by the biblical tower of Babel.</TE>
<TE>   He designed and built a 330-foot aqueduct of snow, and a tower of
chopped firewood.</TE>
<TE>   These creations stood in soft harmony with this serene piece of
Russia, where the afternoon sun paints a silvery light on every leaf,
where the river lies cloaked in unctuous fog under a full moon. At
the end of each season, the creations melted, or he destroyed them.</TE>
<TE>   "In the summer of 2000, everyone called me 'the madman,' " he said
of artist friends back in Moscow. "People gave me a hard time,
saying: 'What are you doing? You're working with hay?' They didn't
think it was art. They said: 'Get your act together. Go back to real
art. Go back to painting.' "</TE>
<TE>   The hay tower photographs, exhibited widely in Moscow, as well as
in Paris and at Montenegro's contemporary art biennial, show the
golden spiral baking in the midday summer sun, and in misty autumnal
dawn, dusted like sugared icing with frost. They show the hay mowers
with their scythes, villagers with faraway eyes and careworn faces.</TE>
<TE>   The works made Polissky so well known that people now come from
Moscow and surrounding areas to view them.</TE>
<TE>   But Polissky's time in the village is a blink compared with
Natalya Bubnova's 95 years. Her horizon has shrunk with the years.</TE>
<TE>   "A tower?" said Bubnova, a bent, withered figure. "Yes, we have a
tower." Pausing as she hacked branches for kindling, she gestured
toward an ugly rusting water tower. She was bemused to hear about
another tower, this one of branches, a few hundred yards from her
door.</TE>
<TE>   "No. There were no towers of wood here. Never."</TE>
<TE>   The village seems paralyzed by tragedy. There is no work. The
place is dying. It never recovered from the collapse of the local
Soviet-era collective farm and the slaughter of its 1,500 pigs and
1,000 cows in the mid-'90s.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Kozhevnikova, 65, has harvested a life of hardship.</TE>
<TE>   The widow, alone these last 20 years except for a succession of
cats, dogs, pigs and her cow, Malyshka--"little one"--always rose at
4 a.m. to milk, and struggled in bitter snows up the long hill from
the river carrying water for the stock. By June, it got to be too
much and she knew that Malyshka would have to go to the butcher.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very sorry day. I even cried. But I couldn't look after
her anymore. My legs don't work now."</TE>
<TE>   Some Consider the Works Frivolous</TE>
<TE>   The fantastical constructions of wood and hay might have made
Polissky famous, but they can't save the village or bring back the
past. So one might forgive those here who are a little cynical or
skeptical of the artist and his work.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it's no good to us babushkas," Kozhevnikova said.
Polissky and his friends "haven't achieved anything that we could put
to good use."</TE>
<TE>   When Polissky asked villagers to help him build the 220 snowmen
for his first creation, most thought that he was crazy. But money is
money.</TE>
<TE>   To Alexander Kondrashov, 48, a former collective-farm worker, the
project was "just a job. There was pay. We weren't wasting our time."
But to Dmitry Mozgunov, a 22-year-old unemployed man who was born in
a milder Central Asian city, it was a fantastic gift, compensation
for the snowmen he could never build as a little boy.</TE>
<TE>   "When we built a lot of them, it turned out all the snowmen had
different individual faces. Of course, we had our favorites,"
Polissky said. "They all had their own fates too. Some fell down
straight away. Some lived longer."</TE>
<TE>   Mozgunov, who moved here when he was 12, said, "There were some
that turned out evil. It wasn't that we wanted it that way. The
material would tell what it had to tell."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps making snowmen was too much fun to be considered
worthwhile, because that's when the criticism started, much of it
whispered behind hands.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'It's all a worthless prank, it's useless,' " Mozgunov
said. "I tried to explain that it's art. It's like a painting, to
create something with your hands and photograph it."</TE>
<TE>   Kondrashov endures poverty of both time and money, working from 8
a.m. to 8 p.m. on a small farm plot, and from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. as a
national park watchman earning $30 a month. He snatches sleep on the
job.</TE>
<TE>   To him, Polissky has what seems a wealth of time and money and he
expends it on whimsies.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives the village nothing. It's like childish games. It has no
relation to life, production, reality," Kondrashov said. "It's simply
nothing. It has no meaning for me.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it only causes inconvenience for the locals. In the past,
it was a quiet village. No one ever bothered us. Right now there's
more dust, more cars, more people. It bothers people, irritates
them."</TE>
<TE>   Project Takes Up Resident's Free Time</TE>
<TE>   Villager Yevgeny Zelensky, 22, spends most of his free time
working on the latest project, despite opposition from his parents,
who see it as a dead end.</TE>
<TE>   "They want me to leave the village as soon as possible and get a
job," said Zelensky, who wants to find work as a car mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   For other parents, it's a relief that their sons have something to
occupy them, even if that is standing atop a 90-foot tower with no
safety rope.</TE>
<TE>   And when they see these short-lived skyscrapers, the feeling can
be magical.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of villagers have never been any higher than their
rooftops," said Mozgunov, standing near the latest tower of branches
and twigs. "The idea scares them. But they go up the tower and
they're lost for words."</TE>
<TE>   After three triumphant creations, villagers now "expect us to pull
off something grandiose every year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since 2000, Polissky and his team have created a big project every
summer and a snow project in winter, though the weather has played
havoc with their snow sculptures.</TE>
<TE>   Yevgeny Zheltov, 44, who was born here, said Polissky and his

<HD>Congress Balks at Rushing Vote</HD>
<DH>Iraq: Top lawmakers tell Bush that more groundwork is
needed before they can decide on backing any military action against
Baghdad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK and JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As President Bush leans on Congress to authorize action against Iraq
in a matter of weeks, many leading lawmakers--including some members
of his own party--are bridling at the pressure and warning that
considerably more groundwork needs to be laid before they are
prepared to vote on the White House request.</LD>
<LD>   "There is not consensus on many critical questions" about the use
of force in Iraq, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph
R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) warned in a
letter Tuesday to the president.</LD>
<LD>   The letter was sent as Bush prepared to deliver a major speech to
the United Nations on Thursday that his aides said would present his
strongest case for ousting Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   At the White House, Bush on Tuesday continued his campaign to woo
allied leaders to his cause. But Portuguese Prime Minister Jose
Manuel Durao Barroso became the latest in a growing list of European
leaders to signal opposition to unilateral U.S. action.</TE>
<TE>   "Where there are global threats that have to have a global answer,
we should act globally," Durao Barroso said.</TE>
<TE>   Although few doubt that Bush will win whatever authority he seeks
from Congress whenever it comes to a vote, many lawmakers are
expressing qualms about his preference that they address the issue
before Congress adjourns in mid-October for the final weeks of this
year's campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be one of the most important decisions Congress makes
in a number of years; I do not believe it should be made in the
frenzy of an election year," said Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo). He
said he is prepared to enthusiastically support a preemptive attack
on Iraq, but he proposed that lawmakers meet in a special
postelection session to vote on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Unless Bush changes course, however, Congress faces a month jammed
with intelligence briefings, hearings and lobbying--a crash course on
the threat that the administration believes is posed by Iraq. On
Tuesday, officials fanned out around the Capitol for briefings to
share intelligence with rank-and-file lawmakers as well as party
leaders. The House Armed Services Committee held a hearing on Iraq's
weapons capability--the first open congressional hearing on the
subject since lawmakers returned from a summer recess to find the
capital ringing with talk of war.</TE>
<TE>   The many voices of caution--at home and abroad--underscored the
high stakes in Bush's seminal speech Thursday, his first extended
public address on the case for taking new action against Iraq. The
immediate audience will be the U.N., but the speech is also
considered crucial to winning support from wavering members of
Congress as well as the public.</TE>
<TE>   "After the president delivers his speech, that will be a
beginning" of intense congressional scrutiny, said Sen. Olympia J.
Snowe (R-Maine), who said she is not yet prepared to support
authorizing the use of force.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking with reporters after a visit Tuesday to the Afghan
Embassy in Washington, Bush previewed the case he will make to the
U.N. for action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm deeply concerned about a leader who has ignored the United
Nations for all these years, refused to conform to resolution after
resolution after resolution, who has weapons of mass destruction,"
Bush said of Hussein. "And the battlefield has now shifted to
America, so there's a different dynamic than we've ever faced
before."</TE>
<TE>   A senior administration official said Bush in his speech will seek
U.N. action--but not recommend a specific course.</TE>
<TE>   "He is going to go to the U.N. and he will say that this is not
just our problem, this is the world's problem," said the aide, who
requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the official said Bush will reserve the right to
act without U.N. support or approval. "The president is also going to
make very clear that the United States is not prepared to stand by
and let this situation continue," the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials have been downplaying the expectation
that the speech will include new information on allegations that
Hussein's regime is producing weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush advisors made the rounds on Capitol Hill on Tuesday,
lawmakers said little new information was offered. But the briefings,
spearheaded by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and CIA
Director George J. Tenet, represented an aggressive new effort to
expand the circle of members being briefed.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's allies are increasingly making the case that no "smoking
gun" is needed beyond the existing record of Hussein's efforts to
develop nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction--coupled with
new information that those efforts have intensified.</TE>
<TE>   But skeptics say there is still not enough documentation on the
threat posed by Iraq. Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) called on the CIA
to develop an official estimate of Iraq's ability to produce and
deploy weapons of mass destruction, saying he was "stunned" to learn
that such an assessment does not exist.</TE>
<TE>   "We're being asked to go to war, and vote on it in a matter of
days," Durbin said. "We need an intelligence estimate before we can
seriously vote."</TE>
<TE>   Even some Democrats who are administration allies say they feel in
the dark about the White House's plans.</TE>
<TE>   "I know so little about what they are specifically thinking," said
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills), a longtime critic of Hussein
who is prepared to support a preemptive strike. "They have not really
reached out."</TE>
<TE>   The administration's ability to make its case in detail to
lawmakers may be key to bringing the matter to a quick vote. Some
Democrats worry that an expedited timetable is rushing deliberations
on a monumental issue--one that could have ramifications in this
year's congressional elections by shifting attention to national
security issues that play to GOP political strengths.</TE>
<TE>   "I know of no information that would suggest the threat is so
imminent that we have to do it in October," said House Minority Whip
Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) has expressed worry
about the politicization of the debate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so important that we do this right, not rush to some
judgment," he said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats are not alone in being uneasy about a quick decision in
the heat of the campaign season, and at a time when many
constituents--even in Republican districts--remain unswayed about the
need for military action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see the vote after the election," said Rep. Robert W.
Ney (R-Ohio). "The president has some groundwork to do."</TE>
<TE>   Lugar, a respected Republican on foreign policy matters, and Biden
urged Bush in their letter to do more to explain his long-term goals
in the region, noting that is one of the issues on which national
consensus seems to be lacking.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, the Armed Services Committee began building the case
for an attack in an open hearing on Iraq's weapons capabilities. In
blunt testimony, two former U.N. weapons inspectors warned that
further inspections, if allowed, would not necessarily erase the
threat posed by a dictator seeking weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a regime that is determined to deny, to deceive, the
inspectors don't have a chance," said Richard Spertzel, a former
monitor who is an authority on the Iraqi biological weapons program.</TE>

<HD>NASA Orders a Powerful New Space Observatory</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: TRW wins an $825-million contract for a
telescope to be built in the Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TRW Inc. was selected by NASA on Tuesday to build a new space
telescope, a high-profile scientific project that represents an
endorsement of Southern California's leadership in the space
industry.</LD>
<LD>   The new observatory--to be 10 times more powerful than the
existing Hubble Space Telescope it will replace--will allow
astronomers to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists hope to use the capability to understand what happened
after the big bang that created the universe.</LD>
<TE>   TRW engineers have designed a telescope that will orbit the sun
about a million miles from Earth. Rather than a single mirror, the
new telescope will have 36 mirrors forming a single 20-foot-diameter
array.</TE>
<TE>   Although the $825-million contract is not large by aerospace
industry standards, it is among the most prestigious programs in the
space business. TRW would build the telescope at its Redondo Beach
plant, which has 9,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   "Besides the space station, it's probably NASA's biggest
scientific project for the next 10 years," said Marco Caceres, senior
space analyst for Teal Group, an aerospace research firm in Fairfax,
Va.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three months, TRW has won three major satellite
programs and in recent years other Southern California firms have
several awards that have further solidified the region's role in the
space industry.</TE>
<TE>   The importance of the TRW award is reflected in the achievements
of the Hubble, launched in 1990 into an orbit 375 miles above Earth.</TE>
<TE>   It has provided stunning photographs of galaxies and insights into
the beginning of the universe.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's next-generation space telescope is expected to replace
Hubble by 2010 and provide what scientists hope will be clues to how
galaxies formed.</TE>
<TE>   In awarding the contract, NASA officials named the telescope after
James E. Webb, who directed the Apollo missions that eventually
landed the first astronauts on the moon.</TE>
<TE>   TRW beat Lockheed Martin Corp. for the contract. The entire
program is expected to cost $1.3 billion, including future contracts
for electronic sensors.</TE>
<TE>   NASA hopes to keep the cost well under the $2-billion price tag
for Hubble, which has operated for 12 years and is expected to last
10 more years.</TE>
<TE>   The telescope is designed to last five years, though NASA hopes to
be able to extend its lifespan.</TE>
<TE>   The company anticipates hiring 400 engineers for the project.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, TRW has won several major government contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the company won the largest satellite production
contract in its history, a $6.5-billion program to build a new fleet
of primary weather-monitoring satellites for joint military and civil
use.</TE>
<TE>   Just a three months earlier, the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency
selected TRW to oversee a $6-billion satellite system to track enemy
ballistic missiles.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably one of TRW's best years ever," Caceres said. "I
can't recall a year where they have won so many major contracts in a
relatively short time, and they've basically beaten the industry
leaders in doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland-based TRW is in the process of being acquired by
Northrop Grumman Corp., which has its headquarters in Century City.</TE>
<TE>   The TRW contracts add to work underway at Boeing Co. facilities in
El Segundo and Seal Beach where the company is developing supersecret
spy satellites for the Pentagon, which intelligence analysts estimate
could be worth up to $25 billion over two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing's El Segundo complex is the world's largest commercial
satellite maker.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to TRW and Boeing, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena produces the nation's deep space probes.</TE>
<TE>   Aerospace analysts said the TRW project is "pushing the scientific
envelop in several different ways," including placing a spacecraft in
a permanent orbit around the sun.</TE>
<TE>   After its launch on an expendable rocket, probably Lockheed
Martin's new Atlas V, the spacecraft will take three months to reach
its destination about 940,000 miles from Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Positioned at so-called second Lagrange Point, the spacecraft will
be able to literally hover in space, balanced between the gravity of
the sun and Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Once in position, the spacecraft will unfurl a sun shade about the
size of a tennis court.</TE>
<TE>   A fiber shield will protect the mirrors from the light and heat of
both the sun and the Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The infrared sensors will be cooled to very low temperatures
without the use of complicated refrigeration equipment, NASA said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like Hubble at all," said Charles Vick, chief space
policy analyst for the Federation of American Scientists. "The design
approach is very, very unique, and frankly I don't comprehend it
myself."</TE>
<TE>   Shielded from light, the telescope will be able to detect with
more precision and clarity the first objects to emerge after the big
bang, NASA said. Some of the objects date back 12 billion to 13
billion years but astronomers aren't quite sure what these objects
might be.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Hubble telescope is a significant improvement from
earthbound observatories that are hindered by the atmospheric
distortion, it has been unable to see the earliest objects.</TE>
<TE>   And although the Hubble is now considered an important contributor
to astronomy, it wasn't without major problems in its early days. The
first images it sent back to Earth were fuzzy because its mirror had
been improperly ground and polished.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, space shuttle astronauts have worked on the Hubble
four times. While the Hubble cost about $2 billion to develop and
launch, analysts believe an additional $4 billion has been spent
operating and repairing it.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, TRW's telescope positioned so far from Earth could
not be repaired if something goes awry, raising some anxiety among
NASA watchers. "We are not going to have manned access to do the
repairs and the refurbishment like we did with the Hubble, which is a
serious issue," Vick said. "A lot of people are going to be chewing
their fingernails."</TE>
<TE>   TRW executives are a bit more confident, citing their experience
developing other successful spacecraft including the Chandra X-ray
Observatory and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. But they
acknowledge the challenge of the telescope's design.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty stunning what this mission will do compared to the
Hubble," said Tim Hannemann, chief executive of TRW's Space &amp;
Electronics unit in Redondo Beach. "This will be a real
breakthrough."</TE>

<HD>DNA Evidence May Clear Man of Raping Girl, 8</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who has spent the last 15 years in prison should be freed
because DNA evidence shows he did not rape an 8-year-old girl, state
Atty. Gen. Mike McGrath said in Billings.</LD>
<LD>   McGrath joined Yellowstone County Atty. Dennis Paxinos in asking a
District Court judge to vacate the convictions against Jimmy Ray
Bromgard, 33. McGrath said it is the first case in Montana in which
DNA evidence showed a person convicted of a crime was innocent. A
jury convicted Jimmy Ray Bromgard in 1987 of three counts of raping
the Billings girl, who picked him out of a police lineup. He was
convicted largely on her testimony, McGrath said. He was sentenced to
40 years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   A hearing on the request is scheduled for Oct. 1.</LD>

<HD>Senate OKs $6-Billion Drought Aid</HD>
<DH>Economy: The action counters Bush's hopes to curb spending.
Critics see an election-year ploy to boost farm-state Democrats'
fortunes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Defying President Bush's efforts to hold the line on spending, the
Democratic-led Senate, in a vote tinged with election-year politics,
on Tuesday approved nearly $6 billion in emergency aid for
drought-stricken farmers and ranchers.</LD>
<LD>   Critics of the relief measure said it was a ploy by Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle to aid Democratic farm-state senators,
including his South Dakota colleague, Sen. Tim Johnson, who are in
tight reelection fights. Johnson faces a strong challenge from
Republican John R. Thune in one of the races central to control of
the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   The 79-16 vote approving drought relief was an early skirmish in
the many spending battles expected between the administration and
Congress.</LD>
<TE>   With the federal budget again running at a deficit, Bush wants to
clamp down on spending, especially for politically popular programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to come to the recognition that deficits don't come from
heaven," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), who opposed the aid.
"Deficits occur because we make decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Bush has expressed sympathy for farmers and ranchers, but he wants
drought relief to be drawn from a recently approved farm bill that
provides $180 billion to farmers over the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   But the difficult task facing the administration's push for budget
restraint was underscored when farm-state Republicans joined
Democrats in approving the drought assistance. The measure faces a
more uncertain future in the Republican-controlled House.</TE>
<TE>   The drought is rated moderate or worse in nearly half the
contiguous United States, and severe or worse in a third of the
country, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's Climate Prediction Center.</TE>
<TE>   In the East, drought encompasses large areas from New England
south to Georgia and west to Illinois and Alabama. In the West, it
extends from Montana south to the Mexican border and west to Oregon
and Southern California. It also extends east to the High Plains from
western South Dakota to Kansas, and it now is reaching into Missouri
as well.</TE>
<TE>   "To go to farms that have had crops--some good, some bad--but
crops every year for 70 years and today see that this year there is
no crop for the first time ever is an eye-opening experience," said
Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.). "To walk across a cornfield and find only
shriveled cobs that can barely be shucked and have no kernels is an
eye-opening experience. This isn't a result of poor planning or some
unfortunate weather; this is the result of a natural disaster."</TE>
<TE>   An aide to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who voted for the
bill, said the measure would help California avocado and almond
growers whose crops were damaged by other natural disasters,
including freezing temperatures and wildfires, in addition to
drought. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) also voted for the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's helpful to California," said Jack King, director of national
affairs for the California Farm Bureau. "This helps farmers who
suffered unusual natural disasters. It gives them a boost at a time
when times are tough."</TE>
<TE>   No estimates were available on the economic losses to California
agriculture caused by natural disaster. In South Dakota, the fiscal
loss attributed to drought has been estimated at $1.8 billion. "Some
counties have had less rain this year than they had in 1936 during
the Dust Bowl," Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   The drought assistance was included in a $19-billion spending bill
for the Interior Department. The House's Interior spending bill does
not include any drought assistance, and an influential farm group
vowed to lobby hard for the aid.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of work left, but it can be done," said Chris
Garza, director of congressional relations for the American Farm
Bureau Federation.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said the administration was
committed to work with Congress to help farmers. But, he said, "we
can do it and should do it in a way that is within budget limitations
and that does not bust the budget."</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman said in a letter to Senate
leaders: "The farm bill should break the bad fiscal habit of needing
to pass emergency agriculture spending bills including drought,
flood, or other supplemental payments that make it difficult for
Congress to live within its budget."</TE>
<TE>   But political analysts said the administration's position could
hurt Republican efforts to regain control of the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush's opposition to drought relief could result in a political
drought for Republicans running in the farm belt," said Marshall
Wittmann, a political scholar at the Hudson Institute in Washington.
"Daschle sent a direct dare to the White House to oppose a drought
relief bill that is deeply desired in the farm belt. This bill
highlights the difficulty of having any semblance of restraining
congressional spending in an even-numbered election year."</TE>
<TE>   Stanley E. Collender, a budget expert with the public relations
firm of Fleishman-Hillard, said: "Republicans as well as Democrats
are now in a 'spend more' mode. Unless the president is willing to
challenge members of his own party with vetoes, it now seems clear
that the White House is going to have to swallow the additional
spending and that the deficit will be higher than anyone was willing
to admit only a few weeks ago."</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said the drought relief
measure was intended to aid Johnson's reelection campaign. "Anybody
who does not recognize that is walking through life with blinders
on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I just did it to help Democrats, I guess I am puzzled why so
many Republicans would help us," Daschle responded.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Ellis, senior director of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a
Washington-based watchdog group, described the vote as "a realization
that control of the Senate will be won or lost in farm country this
November, and both parties do not want to commit political suicide by
crossing the farm lobby. The president and fiscally responsible
lawmakers face overwhelming political odds in their efforts to slow
the runaway spending train."</TE>

<HD>Reno Trails in Fla. Vote Plagued by Problems</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, once a prohibitive favorite for the
Florida Democratic gubernatorial nomination, trailed first-time
candidate Bill McBride on Tuesday night as the state's first big test
of its new election system erupted in controversy.</LD>
<LD>   Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, whom McBride or Reno will be seeking to
unseat in November, declared a "state of emergency" and ordered
polling places to remain open two hours longer than planned following
reports that many voters had been unable to cast their ballots.</LD>
<LD>   With about 85% of the vote counted, McBride, a Tampa attorney, was
holding a 46%-to-42% lead over Reno. But, in an echo of the state's
ballot wars after the 2000 presidential campaign, Reno advisors
hinted at possible legal challenges if the final tally shows only a
narrow gap between the candidates. Vote counting was continuing
through the night.</LD>
<TE>   That possibility emerged after widespread reports of delays,
confusion and problems with new touch-screen voting machines ordered
after the 2000 disputes over punch-card ballots. The problems were
most acute in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, where Reno was
expected to be strong.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a whole lot of questions and issues, and we can't begin
to answer them tonight," Alan G. Greer, the Reno campaign's general
counsel, said late Tuesday. "If we beat Bill McBride by 50,000 votes,
there is no question. If he beats us by 50,000 votes, I think
likewise there is no question. The problem is the gray area."</TE>
<TE>   In other primary results, Republican Rep. John E. Sununu defeated
Sen. Bob Smith for New Hampshire's GOP Senate nomination Tuesday
night after a hotly contested race.</TE>
<TE>   The result could be critical in November's battle for control of
the Senate, where Democrats now hold a one-vote majority. Strategists
in both parties have believed that outgoing Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, the
Democratic Senate nominee, would have a much better chance of
capturing the seat for her party against Smith than Sununu.</TE>
<TE>   In the night's other major Senate contests, Elizabeth Hanford Dole
swept past minor opposition to claim the Republican nomination in
North Carolina. And in the race for the state's Democratic Senate
nomination, Erskine Bowles, former White House chief of staff for
President Clinton, swept to victory over state Rep. Dan Blue and
Secretary of State Elaine Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   In all, voters were picking candidates in 12 states and the
District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Florida was once again the site of the greatest controversy as the
latest ballot snafus threatened another clouded result.</TE>
<TE>   Reno, attorney general for virtually the entirety of the Clinton
administration, was the front-runner from the moment she indicated
her interest in the summer of 2001. So formidable did Reno initially
appear that former Rep. Pete Peterson, the candidate many centrists
hoped to recruit, decided not to run. That left only McBride, a Tampa
attorney and former Marine making his first bid for elected office,
and state Sen. Daryl Jones, an African American from Miami.</TE>
<TE>   For months, polls showed Reno maintaining a large lead over
McBride but remaining stuck far behind Bush in general election
tests. Those two numbers eventually proved incompatible. Concerns
about Reno's electability drove many party insiders to back McBride
and he raised significantly more money than Reno.</TE>
<TE>   McBride used a late media blitz to close the gap with Reno.
Republicans grew concerned enough about McBride to attack him in TV
spots during the primary. But that may have reinforced McBride's
central argument--electability--by allowing him to say that
Republicans feared him.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Kane, the chief pollster for the independent Florida Voter
poll, said the attention McBride would attract for an upset victory
could catapult him into competition against Bush. But, Kane added,
any lengthy legal challenge over the results would likely "mortally
wound" the Democratic winner.</TE>
<TE>   In Arizona, Democratic Atty. Gen. Janet Napolitano and former Rep.
Matt Salmon, a Republican, won their parties' gubernatorial nods for
what's likely to be a close contest.</TE>
<TE>   The New Hampshire Senate primary uncomfortably divided state
Republicans between two well-known politicians who each enjoy a
strong base of support.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who was first elected in 1990 and then won reelection
narowly in 1996, opened the door to Sununu's challenge in 1999. Smith
resigned from the GOP and announced he would seek the presidency as
an independent; a few months later, unable to raise money, he
abandoned the campaign and rejoined the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   But lingering resentment over the episode provided fuel for
Sununu, a three-term House member whose father served as the state's
governor and White House chief of staff under former President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent public polls showed both Smith and Sununu running
about even in a general election matchup with Shaheen. But Sununu, a
less polarizing figure than Smith, benefited from a sense among most
Republican insiders that he would be a stronger candidate in
November.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the close result, veteran New Hampshire GOP strategist Tom
Rath predicted the party would unite behind Sununu.</TE>
<TE>   In North Carolina, Bowles will face an uphill climb against Dole,
a former Cabinet secretary who briefly sought the Republican
presidential nomination in 2000. She is the wife of 1996 Republican
presidential nominee Bob Dole.</TE>
<TE>   The North Carolina seat is being vacated by retiring Sen. Jesse
Helms, a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   In the night's other major contests, businessman Craig Benson, a
first-time candidate, was leading state Sen. Bruce Keough for the GOP
gubernatorial nomination in New Hampshire. Former state Sen. Mark
Fernald, who wants a state income tax for education, captured the
Democratic nomination. Benson would start the general election as the
favorite.</TE>
<TE>   With about half the Wisconsin vote counted, Atty. Gen. Jim Doyle
narrowly led U.S. Rep. Thomas M. Barrett and county official Kathleen
Falk for the Democratic gubernatorial bid. The winner will face
Republican Gov. Scott McCallum, who has been weakened by a state
budget shortfall. Democrats consider this one of their top
opportunities to gain a governorship.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, D.C., faced the prospect of a night without a winner
after first-term Mayor Anthony A. Williams was booted off primary
ballots for fraud in his nominating petitions. Local TV reported that
exit polls gave Williams a big lead over the Rev. Willie Wilson. But
because both sides were relying on write-ins, results might not be
fully available for days.</TE>

<DH>Election: Polls open late, problems reported with high-tech
ballots. Bush extends hours of voting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Tuesday was supposed to be Florida's chance at a makeup exam in
civics, to show itself and the rest of the country that it had
learned the right lessons from the fiasco of 2000 and could organize
a proper election.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, in the first statewide voting since Floridians cast
ballots for president 22 months ago, polls opened late in many
precincts, and the high-tech ATM-style touch-screens that were
supposed to relegate the old punch-card ballots to the ash heap of
history showed they could pose their own troubles.</LD>
<LD>   With problems reported in precincts from Jacksonville to Miami,
Gov. Jeb Bush proclaimed a "state of emergency" and ordered polls
across Florida kept open for an additional two hours, until 9 p.m.,
"to ensure maximum citizen participation in the electoral process."</LD>
<TE>   Keenly aware of being yet again in the spotlight, state officials
noted that voter complaints were concentrated in the Miami and Fort
Lauderdale areas, and that the day went smoothly in most of the rest
of the peninsula. The effect of the miscues on actual returns was
unclear Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   In one predominantly black neighborhood in Miami's Liberty City,
voting didn't begin until 11:45 a.m., nearly five hours behind
schedule, and more than 500 would-be voters were turned away.</TE>
<TE>   Janet Reno, the former U.S. attorney general who was one of three
candidates in Florida's Democratic gubernatorial primary, arrived at
the polling station near her Kendall home before it opened at 7 a.m.,
but she had to cool her heels outside as election officials booted up
the new computerized touch-screen machines.</TE>
<TE>   Reno waited about 15 minutes before she was able to cast her
ballot, but other voters who were more impatient gave up. Reno later
called on Bush, the Republican incumbent she was hoping to face in
the general election on Nov. 5, to extend polling in counties where
machines weren't working earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "Thousands of people were unable to vote this morning and deserve
a chance to vote this evening," Reno said in a statement. "With the
eyes of the whole world watching Florida's first major election since
the 2000 recount, it is more important than ever that our state
proactively takes steps to protect every person's right to vote."</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, we have had some glitches," admitted Miami-Dade
Mayor Alex Penelas, apologizing to voters in his county for problems
posed by 6,300 new voting machines. He asked people who hadn't been
able to cast ballots in the morning to return to the polls in the
afternoon or evening.</TE>
<TE>   To the north in Broward County, home to more registered voters
than any other county in the state, scores of poll workers did not
show up on time or at all, and polls opened late in at least six
cities. In Miramar, some voters waited for more than three hours to
vote. Some people blamed poor organization and poll worker recruiting
and training by the county's new supervisor of elections, Miriam
Oliphant, a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   As news spread of what one South Florida television station dubbed
election "chaos and confusion," some disgruntled people called or
e-mailed local media to vent. "This is outrageous," Pauline Winick of
Miami Beach told the Miami Herald. "After being so embarrassed by
Florida's voting scandal, you would have thought that they'd do
better than this."</TE>
<TE>   After casting her vote at a polling station on Miami's Biscayne
Bay, schoolteacher Arlene Prieto, 43, theorized that there was a
political agenda behind the spate of voting problems. "It's
indicative that there isn't the highest degree of integrity in
ensuring the rights of voters in Florida, especially minority
voters," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Newly appointed Secretary of State Jim Smith, a Republican who
endorsed Reno's call for extended voting hours, angrily placed the
blame for the mess at the polls on the shoulders of officials in
Miami-Dade and Broward counties, which reported the bulk of Tuesday's
problems. "I'd like to know what ... they've been doing for two
years," Smith, the state's top election official, said heatedly in
Tallahassee. "Sixty-five counties have gotten it right, not perfect,
but they've gotten it right. Two counties have again, I think, caused
some embarrassment to our state, and I regret that."</TE>
<TE>   "We expected problems, but not to this magnitude," said Gisela
Salas, Miami-Dade's assistant supervisor of elections. Her boss,
David Leahy, is a registered independent, and he has held his job for
more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   On May 4, 2001, the Florida Legislature voted to outlaw punch card
ballots and allocated $32 million to buy new voting machines, fund a
voter education program and train poll workers. That was six months
after Florida's disputed election returns plunged the country into a
constitutional crisis that lasted for 36 anxious days before George
W. Bush was declared the victor in this state, and thus the country.</TE>
<TE>   The state-of-the-art electoral technology, touted as a national
model, was supposed to guarantee that an election would never again
hinge on precisely how much of a hole voters were able to make with a
small stylus in a punch card.</TE>
<TE>   But the touch screens brought their own array of complications,
people said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who aren't familiar with computers might need a bit of
training," said Jasmine Kastel, a 28-year-old Miami Beach
businesswoman. Some voters had trouble operating the unfamiliar
machines, and in some instances forgot to press the button that casts
the ballot. Some registered Democrats were given Republican ballots.</TE>
<TE>   In several precincts, poll workers were evidently intimidated by
or unfamiliar with the new devices. In Duval County, which includes
Jacksonville, poll workers in one neighborhood apparently didn't
realize they had to turn on the voting machines themselves. They
waited 90 minutes for technicians who never came, then flipped the
switches themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of poll workers that are elderly, and they're a
little bit afraid of computers, and they're looking at these
[machines] as if they were computers," said Salas, the Miami-Dade
election official. "And a lot of them were hesitant to get the
procedure started early in the morning, and we had to walk them
through it."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the mishaps in Florida's primary will sway the results was
uncertain. "We're not going to have the kind of problems we had in
2000," Smith insisted. But many of the reported glitches occurred in
the areas that political observers say Reno must capture to stave off
her chief primary challenger, Tampa lawyer Bill McBride.</TE>
<TE>   In Orlando and the other cities in Orange County used a voting
system in which ballots are read by an optical scanner. But election
officials found that some ballots tore when they fed them into the
scanner, so they examined thousands of cards by hand.</TE>

<HD>Georgia County Votes to Accept Mexico ID Card</HD>
<DH>Policy: Despite concerns on illegal immigration, DeKalb
officials say that the document is better than nothing. Without it,
migrants can't open a bank account.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DECATUR, Ga.</DL>
<LD>After a debate peppered with talk of homeland security and
immigration, DeKalb County on Tuesday became the first county in the
South to accept as official identification a document issued by the
Mexican government.</LD>
<LD>   The seven members of the county's Board of Commissioners wrangled
over whether accepting a Mexican identification card amounted to an
endorsement of illegal immigration or jeopardized border security.
But in the end, practical concerns won out as commissioners said that
it was better that immigrants carry a foreign-issued ID than none at
all, as is often the case. The vote was 6 to 1.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to make sure that everyone carries proper, reliable
identification," said Commissioner Burrell Ellis, who argued that
accepting the Mexican card, known as a matricula consular, was a
"good, common-sense measure."</LD>
<TE>   The identification card is issued by Mexico for its nationals
living on foreign soil. It bears a photograph and biographical data,
including the holder's local address, place of birth and a signature.
A number of municipalities in California and in other states with
high numbers of Mexican migrants, such as Texas, Arizona and
Illinois, already recognize the card as a form of identification in
matters ranging from attending public hearings and borrowing library
books to opening bank accounts and dealing with police.</TE>
<TE>   The tamper-resistant card can serve as identification for migrants
who lack a U.S. driver's license or who do not have papers to live
legally in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in the city of Forest Park, outside Atlanta, also
recently agreed to accept the matricula consular as identification.</TE>
<TE>   But DeKalb County Commissioner Elaine Boyer said Tuesday that
recognizing the cards lent a "veneer of respectability" to holders on
U.S. soil unlawfully. As the nation prepared to commemorate the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, Boyer said, the county would be wrong to accept
the validity of a document over which it had no control.</TE>
<TE>   "If DeKalb County gets into the business of recognizing consulate
ID cards, it is, in effect, opening its own foreign relations office,
something explicitly limited to the federal government," she said.
"We would then turn homeland security over to a foreign government."</TE>
<TE>   Vernon Jones, the county's chief executive officer, said invoking
the attacks was "disrespectful" to the Sept. 11 victims. "This has
nothing to do with" the illegal immigration issue.</TE>
<TE>   Recognition of the card in Georgia is fresh evidence of how the
rapidly growing Latino population has altered life in a region where
there had been few immigrants from Mexico and Latin America just a
decade ago. The South is now home to several metropolitan
areas--including Atlanta, Raleigh-Durham and Greensboro-Winston
Salem, N.C., and Greenville, S.C.--where immigration propelled the
growth of Latino communities at the fastest rates in the country
during the 1990s. Georgia is now home to more than 435,000 Latinos,
quadruple the number in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   In DeKalb County, which includes a sliver of Atlanta and is the
state's second most-populous county with 665,000 residents, nearly 1
resident in 12 is now Latino. Slightly more than half of DeKalb
County's residents are black and about a third are white. The
diversity of the county's population, including immigrants from
Japan, China, Taiwan, the West Indians, East Africa and the Balkans,
can be heard in its schools, where enrollees speak more than 60
languages.</TE>
<TE>   "Our county is evolving to become more of a melting pot. We have
all kinds of nationalities and political persuasions, economic
realities. It's really a melting pot," Commissioner Henry C. Johnson
Jr. said after the vote. "We have to first recognize that our county
has changed and take our heads out of the sand."</TE>
<TE>   As migrants--mostly from Mexico--flocked to jobs in agriculture,
construction, restaurants and hotels throughout the South, local
officials unaccustomed to greeting immigrants now suddenly face
cultural differences and language barriers along with the usual
concerns of filling potholes and issuing building permits. Some
police officers and firefighters are learning Spanish. Cities are
adding Mexican festivals to their calendars. Crime issues have
changed and schools need more Spanish-speaking teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "Five or six years ago, you could look at our Hispanic population
and say that if we had 100 Hispanics in our community, that was it.
Within the last two to three years, we've had a real explosion here.
It creates a whole different understanding and a whole different way
of doing business," said Chuck Hall, mayor of Forest Park, where
about 2,000 of the city's 21,500 residents are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   The influx has created new complications for police, since many of
the newcomers lack immigration documents and carry false papers--or
none. Getting help from witnesses to a crime, for example, can be
difficult without a name that can be verified. And without valid
identification, many immigrants cannot open bank accounts, too often
making them the victims on payday.</TE>
<TE>   In Forest Park, in Clayton County, authorities last year noticed a
wave of robberies directed at migrant workers carrying cash. "They
didn't have a place to keep their money and the thugs figured it
out," said Police Chief Dwayne Hobbs. Police stepped up patrols and
assigned undercover officers in the neighborhoods where immigrants
had been robbed. Several arrests were made. The problem has subsided.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the matricula consular said it is recognized by 64
financial institutions around the country, allowing migrants without
U.S. identification to open bank accounts. Remedios Gomez Arnau,
Mexico's consul general in Atlanta, said use of the documents could
help hundreds of thousands of Mexicans throughout the United States
who are awaiting legalization.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said after the session that she plans to take the campaign
to other spots in Georgia where Mexicans live in high numbers, such
as Hall County, northeast of Atlanta, and elsewhere in the South.
Next up may be Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomat said concerns that the card could endanger homeland
security stemmed from misunderstanding.</TE>
<TE>   "A year from Sept. 11, this kind of fear is understandable," Gomez
said. "I want to tell people they shouldn't be scared."</TE>

<HD>Nation Moves On, Safer if Uncertain</HD>
<DH>Security: Lack of funds may become the key barrier to
protecting Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD T. COOPER and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Twelve months ago, the United States had done so little to protect
itself from terrorists that airlines routinely left cockpit doors
agape and Saudi Arabian travel agents issued U.S. visas.</LD>
<LD>   Shocked by Sept. 11, the nation reacted with a reflexive
outpouring of energy and alarm not seen since the dawn of the Cold
War, with its threats of communist subversion and nuclear holocaust.</LD>
<LD>   Security initiatives were launched of every shape and kind. And
today, while gaping holes remain in anti-terrorist defenses,
Americans are significantly safer, especially in air travel, than
they were when 19 Al Qaeda agents could claim more than 3,000 lives
in a single morning.</LD>
<TE>   In the nation's response to Sept. 11, that was phase one.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes phase two, and it will be harder--a race against time
and ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We've succeeded in raising the bar for anyone with hostile
intentions toward Americans, American infrastructure or American
transportation," says Gerald Kauvar, who headed the President's
Commission on Aviation Security in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next decade, demands for government spending on terrorism
could exceed $600 billion. By comparison, the entire Apollo space
program that put men on the moon cost only $140 billion in today's
dollars. The Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb cost $200
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Spending $600 billion on homeland security would almost certainly
mean prolonged federal deficits and reductions in popular government
programs. In the private economy, less money would be available for
new technology and other productive investments of the kinds that
helped fuel record prosperity after the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say change is necessary. The nation is not as safe as
it needs to be in many areas, including cyber-terrorism and
bioterrorism, areas that intelligence suggests Al Qaeda has been
exploring.</TE>
<TE>   A Matter of Choices</TE>
<TE>   As a result, with money clearly limited and other priorities
reasserting themselves, phase two is about choices: tough
apples-and-oranges choices between competing security needs, such as
your neighborhood nuclear power plant versus my airport or hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we can just keep pouring it on," warns William H.
Webster, former director of the FBI and the CIA. "If we overload the
system with high-cost, nonproductive devices, we're more likely to
see the system fall away."</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, homeland security must compete with the other things
Americans also need and want: economic growth, better schools,
prescription drug benefits for the elderly and the old freedom to
live without government interference.</TE>
<TE>   If decision-makers do not begin to weigh competing needs more
carefully and consider where best to spend limited resources, money
and public support could decline before the essential work is
finished.</TE>
<TE>   That would leave a patchwork of partial defenses, all the more
dangerous because they would encourage a false sense of security and
offer little more real protection than a flood wall with sections
missing.</TE>
<TE>   So far, government action has been driven primarily by public
pressures and doing what came easiest.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of low-hanging fruit you could pluck rather
easily, and we're certainly in the process of doing that," says David
Langstaff, head of Veridian Corp., which does high-tech security work
for the CIA and others.</TE>
<TE>   But most of what remains to be done is more challenging, and it
comes with higher economic and social costs.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the new Transportation Security Administration has
been so preoccupied with air travel that it has paid relatively
little attention to the far bigger challenge of securing the 6.5
million cargo containers that sail into the heart of America's port
cities each year.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, while state and federal officials have been busy
drafting plans for meeting bioterrorist attacks, most of the 3.5
million police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians
and other first responders have received no more than what one
federal official called "basic awareness classes."</TE>
<TE>   The pattern of good but incomplete beginnings can be seen almost
everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   More than half the 30,000-plus screeners who check passengers and
carry-on luggage at airports now work for the federal government, not
rent-a-cop firms. They meet higher qualification standards. They are
also finding a dismaying number of guns in carry-on luggage, most
belonging to police officers and others authorized to carry weapons
who forgot to check them properly.</TE>
<TE>   Weapons Get Through</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, tests by federal agents this summer succeeded in
sneaking guns and explosive devices past the screeners 25% of the
time, on average.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.), chairman of the House aviation
subcommittee, says it will take an additional three years to make
commercial aviation safe.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the Coast Guard spends seven times as many hours on
harbor security as it did a year ago. Its new national vessel
movement center in Martinsburg, W.Va., gets data on cargo and crews
of incoming ships 96 hours before they reach U.S. ports, instead of
24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   That should help uncover potential problems, because the center
has improved access to intelligence files and the State Department's
hugely expanded watch list.</TE>
<TE>   But the information from in-bound ships is too often incomplete,
delivered on blurry faxes or written in languages most agents cannot
read. Legislation to require electronic reporting awaits action by
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Changes at the Border</TE>
<TE>   Border controls are also tighter, with more money and more agents
for the Customs Service and Border Patrol in the pipeline. Customs
now staffs every border crossing 24 hours a day; previously, its
stations on remote highways often closed at night, leaving orange
traffic cones to deter illegal entry.</TE>
<TE>   Customs agents can also call up computer images of individuals who
received visas overseas and compare those with faces presenting
themselves for admission; this real-time checking at Los Angeles
International Airport nailed a 34-year-old Ghanaian with a visa
issued to a 60-year-old and a 30-year-old Indonesian woman whose visa
was rejected by the computer because it had originally been issued to
a man.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, customs continues to struggle with data systems
that are outmoded and incompatible. So do others.</TE>
<TE>   FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III recently admitted that he was
shocked at how antiquated the agency's information storage, retrieval
and sharing systems were. "We are way behind the curve," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Overhauling the FBI's systems will take three years, at least.</TE>
<TE>   This means there's still no guarantee that intelligence and other
information needed to foil terrorists will reach those who need it in
time.</TE>
<TE>   In Congress, pieces of the proposed Department of Homeland
Security are spread out on the tables of assorted committees.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the still-patriotic flavor of public rhetoric, down in the
trenches interest-group politics is reviving.</TE>
<TE>   Many hospitals have quietly resisted a plan to designate specific
treatment centers for biochemical attacks and to prepare them
accordingly. They fear such a designation could frighten away
patients, disrupt business during an emergency and expose the
institutions to new costs.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to strengthen border security in the Pacific Northwest by
using a few hundred National Guard troops collided with Canadian
sensitivity about putting soldiers on the world's longest undefended
border, and even more with parochial concerns in the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The Guard troops did not arrive until April, even though the
Pacific Northwest is where customs agents in 1999 intercepted a car
laden with explosives, its driver intent on bombing LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor security is in danger of bogging down in a dispute over who
pays.</TE>
<TE>   America's loosely controlled seaports are an open invitation to
mega-terrorism. Smuggling a "dirty" bomb into a U.S. city in a cargo
container and using conventional explosives to spread radioactive
waste or biochemical toxins ranks high on lists of "nightmare
scenarios."</TE>
<TE>   High-Tech Tracking</TE>
<TE>   Effective defenses against such attacks require new technology to
track cargo and detect tampering. Shippers have to be willing to live
with burdensome and costly security measures.</TE>
<TE>   In Congress, where more federal spending raises the specter of tax
increases or budget deficits, there's support for user fees.</TE>
<TE>   But the American Assn. of Port Authorities, knowing how
cost-conscious global markets are, says: "Homeland security is like
national defense. It should be paid for through general government
funding, not user fees or taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Being a good soldier can be costly for politicians too.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley boosted police
protection for potential targets, created a city Security Council and
teamed up with Johns Hopkins University to chart medical data that
could pinpoint a biochemical attack.</TE>
<TE>   But police overtime and other costs helped give Baltimore a
$10-million deficit. Some suggest O'Malley overreacted.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what the alternative was," O'Malley says. "I
wouldn't have been able to sleep at night if we weren't doing
everything we possibly could."</TE>
<TE>   But he's bitter about one thing: So far, despite talk of
partnership, Washington has not helped financially. "We haven't
gotten a dime, not one dime," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Why not? In part because Washington has focused on helping local
governments prepare for the future and has been reluctant to pick up
payroll and other costs of day-to-day operations.</TE>
<TE>   At a large level, O'Malley's experience reflects the overriding
fact that anti-terrorism must compete for money and attention with
other needs and wants, both in Washington and at the grass roots.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, history makes it clear that, no matter how pressing the
emergency or how pure the cause, Americans do not always put aside
self-interest in favor of the common good.</TE>
<TE>   American soldiers starved at Valley Forge because Congress refused
to levy the taxes needed to feed them. In the War of 1812, the
governor of Maryland declined to use his militia against British
troops marching to burn the Capitol. Enterprising businessmen in the
North and South, including Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's father, traded
with the enemy during the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   Against such a background, it's no surprise the war on terrorism
is buffeted by competing pressures.</TE>
<TE>   Also, more is at stake than the selfish interests of narrow
groups. In today's global economy, with its emphasis on fast
turnarounds and narrow profit margins, heightened security can impose
extra costs that have big ripple effects.</TE>
<TE>   Time spent in port is the biggest cost in ocean shipping, notes
Robert J.S. Ross of Clark University in Worcester, Mass. He predicts
any measures to increase harbor security that would threaten even
modest delays will be fiercely resisted.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on the hinge, and we're deciding in favor of commerce," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Reassessing Threats</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the challenge of phase two, security experts are taking
a second look at risk assessments performed in the months immediately
after the attacks. What they found might be alarming:</TE>
<TE>   Water supplies were initially judged relatively safe, because
chlorine treatment kills most biological pathogens and the volumes of
water are so immense that poisoning them seemed impracticable.</TE>
<TE>   But "the wrong people have been answering the question," says
Edward J. Jopeck, a former CIA analyst who does risk assessments at
Veridian. "If you ask the chemists and biologists, the answer is
quite different."</TE>
<TE>   Today, toxins and delivery methods defy the traditional wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   The vulnerability of major dams may have been underestimated as
well. "You're not going to do it by driving a Winnebago filled with
explosives onto the top of a dam," says Jopeck, who is working with
operators of large dams. But other forms of attack could be
devastating.</TE>
<TE>   "I could do it," one security specialist says, declining to be
quoted by name.</TE>
<TE>   A recently seized Al Qaeda computer contained technical software
for simulating the destruction of a dam. And terrorist groups include
at least some members trained in the best U.S. engineering schools.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, while the Year 2000 rollover raised awareness of
cyber-security before Sept. 11, experts are troubled by how little
some executives in government and the private sector understand the
huge computer systems on which much of modern life depends.</TE>
<TE>   "If you wanted to attack the critical infrastructure of the United
States in 1940, you had to have an army. Today, you need a computer,
access to the Internet and a few tools from hacker sites," says
Phillip E. Lacombe, a senior Defense Department aide in the Reagan
administration and head of the President's Commission on Critical
Infrastructure Protection in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "We found an electric power grid that was going to put its SCADA
system on the Internet," he says, referring to the computer-based
"supervisory control and data acquisition" systems that lie at the
operational heart of everything from power grids to transit systems
and office towers.</TE>
<TE>   Cyber-attacks, and thus attacks on critical institutions that have
become dependent on computers, can be mounted from literally millions
of locations around the world. At the same time, hacker tools are
becoming more powerful, more widely available and easier to use.</TE>
<TE>   "We are safer," Lacombe says, describing the increased efforts on
cyber-security and the larger effort to combat terrorism, "but it's a
never-ending story. You don't get to stop doing this."</TE>
<TE>   That's why experts say the next phase of the struggle is even more
critical than the 12 months just past. The challenge now is to build
effective anti-terrorist protection into the nation's many
systems--relying less on official alerts and heightened public
awareness.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, heightened awareness is a weak defense against a
phantom menace such as terrorism. In the words of Columbia University
terrorism analyst Richard Betts: "It's impossible to stay perched on
the balls of your feet indefinitely."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Signals 'High Risk' of New Attacks</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: The alert level is raised as officials warn that
Al Qaeda may launch strikes against American targets at home or
abroad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration Tuesday raised the terror alert level to
"code orange," signaling a "high risk of terrorist attack," as
authorities warned of strikes that could be launched against unknown
targets in the United States or abroad.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, appearing with Tom Ridge, director of
homeland security, and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III, said the
code orange warning--the second highest level of alert--was
authorized by President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   The warning, which was the first elevation of the nation's alert
system, came on the eve of Sept. 11 in response to a host of
intelligence intercepts gleaned over the last few weeks, Ashcroft
said. It also was prompted by specific information provided by a top
Al Qaeda operative during interrogations since Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "The United States government has concluded, based on analysis and
specific intelligence of possible attacks on U.S. interests overseas,
to call government, law enforcement and citizens, both at home and
overseas, to a heightened state of alert," Ashcroft said at a news
conference at Justice Department headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "Information indicates that Al Qaeda cells have been established
in several South Asian countries in order to conduct car-bomb and
other attacks on U.S. facilities. These cells have been accumulating
explosives since approximately January of 2002 ... in preparation for
these attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft also said the U.S. intelligence community has received
information that suicide bombers are preparing to strike U.S.
facilities in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   In an extraordinary series of comments, Bush himself--and
Ashcroft, Ridge and other U.S. officials--talked of vague threats but
told Americans to go about their business today as they observe the
one-year anniversary of the terrorist strikes.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Ashcroft and Ridge urged local law enforcement
to step up patrols, employers to have emergency plans in the event of
attacks and all Americans to be wary, vigilant and on the lookout for
suspicious activity.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft specifically singled out transportation and energy
targets, such as planes, buses and power grids as well as U.S.
embassies and military bases abroad. But he also specifically
referred to national monuments as potential "symbolic" targets.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking somberly, Ashcroft also warned of "dramatically new,
unheard of" kinds of terrorist attacks, conceding that he and his
counter-terrorism colleagues had no idea where such attacks might
come from, except from an agitated and highly trained cadre of Al
Qaeda soldiers bent on striking symbols of U.S. power and prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge suggested that parents tell their children about the
significance of the one-year anniversary and to prepare them for
potential attacks so they too could be on the alert.</TE>
<TE>   The concerns had ripple effects in Washington and around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   * Vice President Dick Cheney spent Tuesday night in a secure,
undisclosed location as he had the night before because of general
security precautions related to the Sept. 11 anniversary,
administration officials said. And although there was no indication
that Cheney or Bush were targets, the vice president canceled a
speech he was to deliver Tuesday night in Washington and was to spend
today in an undisclosed location while Bush attends three Sept. 11
commemoration events.</TE>
<TE>   * Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld ordered antiaircraft
missiles deployed earlier in the week around Washington be armed with
live ammunition so that the military could better respond to a
potential attack by hijacked airliners or other aircraft. The
Pentagon said heat-seeking Stinger missiles would be deployed on
military vehicles with firing and guidance units known as "Avenger"
systems.</TE>
<TE>   * Citing specific and credible threats of Al Qaeda-linked attacks,
the State Department closed the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia, while
diplomatic missions in Malaysia, Pakistan, Bahrain, the United Arab
Emirates, Tajikistan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Lebanon and Malawi either
have been closed or will be closed to review security.</TE>
<TE>   * The Pentagon also raised the terrorist alert level for U.S.
military forces around the world, particularly in Bahrain,
headquarters of the U.S. 5th Fleet, and other parts of the Middle
East. Defense officials said intelligence had indicated Al Qaeda was
planning attacks on military ships or even commercial tankers that
transport much of the world's oil supply out of the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Bush said his administration is taking the new
threat information "very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   "Therefore we have gone to a different level of concern, different
threat level, which means our government will be providing extra
security at key facilities and that we'll be increasing
surveillance," Bush said, speaking with reporters after visiting the
embassy of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll do everything we can to protect the American people....
They just need to know that their government, at the federal and
state and local level, will be on an extra level of alert to protect
us."</TE>
<TE>   Since it was established in March, the warning system had been set
at the mid-level yellow, which means an elevated risk. There are five
levels, and only one higher than orange. That level, red, indicates
the government has specific information about an imminent and serious
terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said most of the recent intelligence intercepts that
prompted the orange warning indicate that an attack would most likely
occur overseas, particularly in Southeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Nations such as Malaysia and the Philippines have long been
considered a "second front" in the war on terrorism, after
Afghanistan, because of the large number of Al Qaeda followers there
and an active network of terrorist cells.</TE>
<TE>   But while much of the information about potential terrorist
attacks indicated targets overseas, Ashcroft and other officials
warned that the ominous tone of intelligence chatter is eerily
similar to the drumbeat heard before last September's attacks, the
worst-ever on U.S. soil.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year we were sure it would be overseas," a senior FBI
official said. "But we were sadly mistaken."</TE>
<TE>   That official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that
as a result, the FBI is bracing for another large-scale attack
somewhere on U.S. soil, perhaps not on Sept. 11, but in the near
future.</TE>
<TE>   And this time, there is additional cause for concern: intelligence
intercepts that specifically refer to targets within U.S. borders,
said the official.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen chatter about that," the senior official said in
reference to domestic targets. "Why don't we attack monuments? Why
don't we attack Wall Street?"</TE>
<TE>   Robert Blitzer, the FBI's former head of counter-terrorism, said
the warnings may be general but appear to be based on specific
information that has been verified and deemed credible.</TE>
<TE>   "What they are doing is not revealing the depth of the information
that this person provided," Blitzer said of the Al Qaeda operative.
"They don't want the bad guys to know what they know."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities would not provide details about the Al Qaeda operative
who had given them information this week that helped prompt the
alert.</TE>
<TE>   But Ashcroft said a wealth of other intelligence information had
been gathered in recent weeks that was causing much concern at the
highest levels of government.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda and others "in the terrorist community [have] been very
active in a wide variety of terrorism potentials, and while car bombs
are a very significant part--car bombs, truck bombs, explosive
devices--we also know that the terrorist community has been
interested, and Al Qaeda in specific ... in a wide range of terrorist
devices," Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen that the terrorist community has done research in
... evil biology, evil chemistry and the dispersion of radiological
contaminants and the like," Ashcroft added.</TE>
<TE>   "And those have been the subject of previous endeavors. And,
frankly, when we elevate this alert we want to remain cognizant of
the fact that we're dealing with a complex capacity, with an
organization of international reach ... and capacity to operate."</TE>
<TE>   Blitzer, like some other terrorism experts, said Al Qaeda does not
usually pick anniversaries to strike.</TE>
<TE>   "There is much more of a tendency to allow us to get much more
complacent and comfortable and then hit us," said Blitzer.</TE>
<TE>   "But they are so unpredictable they might just hit us on Sept. 11,
just to show us that they are still lethal."</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda has "had an infrastructure here in the United States for
years," Blitzer said.</TE>

<HD>Rapper's Family Offers Alibi in Shakur Slaying</HD>
<DH>Crime: Documents put Notorious B.I.G. in N.Y., not Las
Vegas, on the night of the killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of Notorious B.I.G. released documents and an audiotape
Tuesday that they contend place the late rapper in a New York
recording studio on the night that rival Tupac Shakur was gunned down
in Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Times reported last week that Notorious B.I.G.,
whose real name was Christopher Wallace, met with members of a
Compton gang in Las Vegas on the night Shakur was shot, provided the
murder weapon and promised to pay the gang $1 million for the
assassination.</LD>
<LD>   Wallace's family said the audiotape and studio paperwork show that
the rapper could not have been in Las Vegas that night, Sept. 7,
1996.</LD>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, the family of Orlando Anderson, identified in The
Times report as the gang member who shot Shakur, issued a statement
denying that Anderson played any role in the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Orlando Anderson did not murder Mr. Tupac Shakur," the statement
said. "He did not accept money nor was he offered any money from
Notorious B.I.G., nor anyone else, to perform such a heinous crime."</TE>
<TE>   The family said Anderson was not a member of the Southside Crips
but rather a "kid" who went to Las Vegas that weekend to have some
"innocent fun." Anderson was killed in May 1998 in a drug-related
shooting at a Compton carwash.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Wallace's estate provided the studio documents to
MTV-News in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The computer-generated invoices indicate that Wallace booked time
in a studio at Daddy's House on the night Shakur was attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Daddy's House is owned by Sean "P. Diddy" Combs, owner of Bad Boy
Entertainment in New York, Wallace's record label.</TE>
<TE>   Someone who saw the documents said they suggest that Wallace
reserved the studio from 12:30 p.m. on Sept. 7, 1996, until 4 a.m. on
Sept. 8, 1996. The invoices indicate that Combs, who was known then
as "Puff Daddy," and another producer were present, along with a few
engineers. Such records are widely used in the music business to bill
artists for studio time.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers and other representatives of the Wallace family declined
requests from The Times to review the invoices. Combs declined to be
interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers also gave MTV-News a digital tape of a song called
"Nasty Girls," which they contend Wallace recorded that evening. The
tape, previously unreleased, bears a sticker indicating that it was
made on Sept. 7 and Sept. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's family issued a statement quoting the rapper's former
manager, Wayne Barrow, as saying that he was with Wallace in the
studio that weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "No way was he in Las Vegas," Barrow said in the statement.</TE>
<TE>   According to the same statement, Wallace took a break from
recording and went to his home in Teaneck, N.J., where he and a
friend, rapper Lil' Cease, watched a cable telecast of a heavyweight
boxing fight in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The statement quoted Lil' Cease as saying: "After his recording
session, I was with him later on in his home watching the
championship boxing match between Mike Tyson and Bruce Seldon at the
MGM Grand Hotel. He was with me all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Shakur attended the Tyson-Seldon fight and was fatally wounded in
a drive-by shooting several hours later, on a crowded street a block
from the Las Vegas Strip. Wallace was killed six months later in Los
Angeles, also in a drive-by attack. Police have made no arrests in
either case.</TE>

Anderson families is available at www.latimes.com/tupacstatements.</TE>

<LD>I recall the World War II propaganda poster I once saw in a museum: A
cartoonish Japanese soldier was shown leering into a bedroom window
with a mind to raping a tender American wife. Only, Americans didn't
use the " ... anese" when they spoke of the enemy in those days. I
remember too the denigrating, dehumanizing nomenclature we casually
assigned in the Vietnam War to a foe who never attacked our shore.</LD>
<LD>   Today, in this new war against "terrorists" or "extremist Islamic
fundamentalists," we remind ourselves not to go too far with
stereotyping or profiling.</LD>
<LD>   Perceptions have changed. This time, we are fighting an enemy we
are trying to understand.</LD>
<TE>   I am proud of my country. The world can envy us.</TE>
<TE>   This is a different kind of war, so it's a different kind of
anniversary. We take stock of ourselves and our nation, knowing that
we cannot see the end, only lulls. We wonder whether the worst is
before us.</TE>
<TE>   After a year, just about every attempt at generalization that can
be made about our nation and our battle with terrorism, has been.
Dare I try another? Only this: The United States is a more temperate,
circumspect country today than it was during its war of 30 years ago,
or the one of 60 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we are a wiser people now. Or maybe the terms of battle
dictate our response because this is a war for ideals ahead of
territory, and it cannot be won without example.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, we hoped we wouldn't lose our wits, and we didn't, or at
least not entirely. We knew we'd need patience, and we've shown it;
I'm speaking of you and me and the family down the block, all of us
torn loose from our individual moorings to ride a strange tide
together as a country. We meant to get on with our lives, and we
have, our mandated company ID badges displayed around our necks,
security cameras tracking our whereabouts, our Cipro in the medicine
chest, our Lotto tickets pinned to the fridge.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, every action, each idea, everyone entrusted with
leadership has been put to the test. Our debates have been nonstop,
passionate, thoughtful--and productive. Our challenge was to show
that pluralistic, secular democracy was strong, not weak. We have.</TE>
<TE>   Two cheers for democracy, as novelist E.M. Forster put it: "One
because it admits variety and two because it permits criticism."</TE>
<TE>   Those who would undermine our values have lost esteem. Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft chief among them. Anyone who wants to deputize mail
carriers as neighborhood spies but won't let his own anti-terrorism
agents review applications for gun purchases is a hard fellow to take
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson also ended up where they belonged,
on the goofball fringe, after suggesting that we got what we deserved
for departing from rote Christian fundamentalism.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of matters, the reflexive antiwar movement
roused few. Our foray into Afghanistan this time has been far more
considered, humane and right than our Cold War proxy mischief there
in the 1980s. That's no small triumph for a complacent and insular
country attacked and made to feel vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of summer 2002, American patriots are those who have
opened their minds, not narrowed them, those who uphold, not
acquiesce.</TE>
<TE>   I am not proud of everything my country's done, or tried to do.
But I'm proud that almost everything we've undertaken has been
measured against what we say we stand for. Not for a generation have
Americans had the opportunity to engage in such a wide-open civic
soul-searching about those things we presume to hold dear.</TE>
<TE>   Today's patriots are those who have not shied from the paradox:
How do we preserve our belief in tolerance when challenged by
intolerance?</TE>
<TE>   It's a different kind of anniversary. The future looms as ominous
as the past. Has everything changed? One thing for sure, it could at
any moment. But we've had 12 months under pressure; a year to assess
our purpose. The weaknesses that others suspected in us have not
brought us down. Our strengths have held us up.</TE>
<TE>   After a year, we have many things to doubt, but no cause to doubt
ourselves.</TE>

<AU>PICO IYER</AU>
<BD>Pico Iyer is the author, most recently, of "The Global
Soul" (Vintage, 2001) and, coming this winter, "Abandon," a novel
about California, Islam and the dialogue between them.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>America is still, a year later, shaking a little on its foundations,
but its sense of itself and its pride in the traditions it upholds
seem more strongly defined (and sometimes more narrowly so) than ever
before in my lifetime. Nothing, alas, so concentrates the mind as a
head-on assault.</LD>
<LD>   Yet even as this sense of "us" seems to intensify--all those flags
murmuring, "You can't destroy us. We stand tall and firm"--so too,
inevitably, does a sense of "them." As a grateful immigrant who has
long found this nation to be the most accommodating of places (and
ideas), I worry that the John Wayne stance it's projecting outside
its borders is taking it further away from a world that it needs
desperately to get closer to.</LD>
<LD>   In recent months I have traveled across Bolivia, Vietnam, Tibet,
Peru, India and many other places, and everywhere I go I come away
with the same impression: It's not Islam that's on trial worldwide,
but the USA.</LD>
<TE>   The United States is the cynosure of every eye, the country that
every other looks to with a mix of admiration, resentment and envy.
Radical Islam is in most places just a muttering in the corner.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, of course, we saw a great outpouring of sympathy
around the world for what Americans were going through (and, among
more hardened types, a sense that the world's great protected
superpower was at last experiencing what is a daily fact of life for
most humans). But with every passing month it feels as if the U.S. is
growing more isolated, to the point where now it seems in many places
just as it seemed to me in Yemen, six weeks before Sept. 11: another
planet.</TE>
<TE>   It's in the nature of an empire, of course, to be unpopular--the
Russians were nobody's favorite in the 1980s (least of all, I found,
among their supposed comrades in Cuba and Vietnam); the Raj,
burnished in such golden hues on PBS, seldom seemed so benign when it
was a center of world power.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the U.S., inevitably, the image is complicated
because the youngest kid on the global block happens to be the
strongest. This is hardly a consoling state of affairs for those
older hands who believe that power comes only with experience and the
truth lies in a distant past that the young can't even remember.</TE>
<TE>   Many people abroad seem to feel that U.S. leaders are much less
sophisticated and worldly than the leaders of much smaller places,
while the American people (whom everyone seems to like) are less
interested, at times, in learning about the world than in changing
it. Certainly the world knows more about us than we know about it.</TE>
<TE>   And when, in Hong Kong this spring, I saw a sign scrawled near the
Star Ferry terminal, in Tagalog and English, saying "U.S., Go Home!"
and in La Paz saw a similar message scribbled across an elegant
colonial building ("U.S., Out of Afghanistan!"), what I really felt I
was seeing was the same message I've been seeing for as long as I've
been traveling: "America, leave us alone!" A sentiment complicated by
the fact that it is often accompanied by a cry, just as urgent, of
"America, take us in!"</TE>
<TE>   In the year since the attacks on the U.S., people here have
learned to live with a much keener sense of frailty and fallibility
and a much sharper understanding that we need to learn more about a
world that is larger than our notions of it. With American dreams
come responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in the rest of the world, the U.S., everyone's favorite
scapegoat, remains more a target of skepticism than ever before; when
everything goes wrong, after all, people blame the person on top. For
many around the world, I suspect, the shock of the attacks is
gradually being eroded by the image of Washington's response, which
allows them to say: "They're doing what they always do. Taking their
frustrations out on the poor."</TE>
<TE>   Today is the first day when Sept. 11 no longer has to signify a
particular traumatic incident; it can refer now to a new day, Sept.
11, 2002. The United States will always be, to some extent,
imprisoned by its power. But if it can show the world that it can be
humble and ready to change, some good may yet come of all it has
suffered. Perhaps the best thing we can learn from older
nations--Vietnam, say, or Japan--is that the most useful response to
loss is to start looking beyond our wounds and toward how we can
avoid hurting others, and getting hurt, again.</TE>

<AU>ANNE NELSON</AU>
<BD>Anne Nelson is the author of "The Guys," which has been
presented in a number of cities and has been published by Random
House.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last September, my life was irreversibly changed by two phone calls.
One was from my father telling me a plane had just struck the World
Trade Center, only a few miles from the desk where I was sitting. The
second call came the next week from a friend of my sister's looking
for someone to help a fire captain compose eulogies for the eight men
he lost in the collapse. I answered the call and was moved both by
the experience and by the grace of the man I was working with.</LD>
<LD>   A few weeks later, when I was asked to write a play about this
experience, I agreed. The play--"The Guys"--has been successful.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the most that I can claim is that I've held up a mirror,
polished by journalistic technique, to reflect a culture that people
needed to know about, and through the power of theater, presented it
in a way that made an emotional connection.</LD>
<TE>   One reason people seek this mirror is that, in the rubble of the
World Trade Center, we also encountered a shattered self-image. New
York in the 1990s was an exciting place to be, but it wasn't always a
kind one.</TE>
<TE>   We were told that everything was for sale and went to the highest
bidder. If you were smart, you became a CEO with those glorious stock
options or a dot-com millionaire. Left in the dust were us chumps,
plodding along on a paycheck in a mundane job.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes it seemed as though the rule was that the greater the
contribution, the stingier the public recognition. Inner-city
teachers and social workers striving to rescue lives seemingly
written off by everyone else. Librarians struggling with shrinking
budgets and shortened hours. Nurses laboring to put a human face on
managed care.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters have had the same gripes about city budgets and
stagnant pay as everyone else. But at the same time--as I have come
to learn--they love and celebrate the job.</TE>
<TE>   Their trade secrets include the humor and camaraderie of the
firehouse, the unlikely combination of structure and spontaneity in a
day's work and the very nature of the mission and the people it
attracts.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 took a devastating toll on firefighters' workplace
companions and environment. Holding on to their collective identity
and asserting their core values have been part of the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   When I wrote my play, I decided that I was not simply going to
write it and move on. To the extent that I was welcome, I would
accompany friends I made in the firehouses over the difficult year
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Their first few months after the attack were a time of blinding,
disorienting grief, disbelief and overload.</TE>
<TE>   Even the firehouses that had no casualties suffered the loss.</TE>
<TE>   Every firefighter who survived Sept. 11 has been tormented by the
question: "Why him and not me?" And every firefighter has family
members who look at him differently now when he goes out the door to
work.</TE>
<TE>   One of the trickiest aspects of the last year has been the
firefighters' relationship with the public. New York firehouses
traditionally are good-natured fixtures in the neighborhoods and, in
a city of walkers, have always made a welcome pause along the way.</TE>
<TE>   But there have been hordes of what the firefighters call
"well-wishers," laden with the best of intentions but sometimes
overwhelming gifts. So the officers have had other tasks this
year--rerouting thousands of teddy bears, dispensing vast boxes of
cookies and pies stacked to the ceiling. Visitors arrived,
unannounced, from many states and many lands, and some firefighters
complained that, at times, it was impossible to hold a drill.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time that the firefighters were being deluged by
symbols of sentiment, they were anxiously seeking more concrete forms
of support.</TE>
<TE>   The city has been slow to remedy a quirk in the pension system
that might cost the department more than a third of the senior
officers and firefighters over the next few months just when their
knowledge and experience are needed the most.</TE>
<TE>   Most firefighters are uncomfortable with the "hero" label. They
don't want to be canonized--they just want to be liked, respected and
given the tools they need to do their job.</TE>
<TE>   For my part, I think of them as role models.</TE>
<TE>   I've made a point of taking frequent reality checks and realizing
that every community must have some flaws. But what I see overall is
a group of people who have the courage and commitment to do work they
love, in the company of people they care about, for the good of the
community.</TE>
<TE>   They've taught me a lot.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For 16 years until just the other day, all U.S. airline clerks were
required to ask every air passenger two questions: "Has any stranger
asked you to carry an item on this flight?" And "Have all your bags
been under your immediate control since you packed them?"</LD>
<LD>   Think about it. For 16 years we and our government thought that
asking two questions at the airport counter could help foil
hijackers. That such people or their unwitting accomplices would
honestly have to turn themselves in right there and then. And our
planes would be safer. Most of us replied "No" even before the rote
questions were finished. Indeed, the 19 known hijacker terrorists of
Sept. 11, 2001, no doubt said "No" too and were probably telling the
truth before they wreaked mayhem with the airplanes themselves.</LD>
<LD>   At dawn last Sept. 11, that verbal security check made sense. By
lunch it was compelling evidence of the national naivete that also
went up in smoke over the World Trade Center, the Pentagon's west
side and the soggy corner of a recovering strip mine in Pennsylvania.</LD>
<TE>   In an earnest American way, we trusted in honesty and a belief in
humanity. We got blindsided. That hurt badly. And now, here we are in
the midst of a global war against terror, a massive security spending
spree and a national orgy of remembering. We're older, surely; a
little wiser, probably; a tad more cynical or skeptical, perhaps.
We've changed some habits--travel less, endure more inconvenience
silently, cherish our families more consciously. When we leave for
work, some may even flash back to those 9/11 victims who left home
their last morning taking a safe return for granted.</TE>
<TE>   As individuals and as a people, we've felt angry at times, even
downright vindictive. Most of us can still feel puzzled, despite the
vivid evidence, that so many elsewhere could actually, sincerely,
viscerally hate us. What for? we ask in another naive, natural
display.</TE>
<TE>   We're more wary as a nation too, thanks to natural caution and, in
part, a developing penchant for "alerts" of all kinds. We've long had
SigAlerts and ozone alerts. Now there's a new panoply of alerts:
national security alerts coded by color from red (severe risk of
terrorist attacks) through orange, yellow, blue and green (low risk).
Cable TV is fond now of news alerts, even if the news isn't all that
new. We have chemical alerts, energy alerts, Amber alerts, collision
alerts, forest fire alerts, high alerts, low alerts and heightened
alerts. We even have West Nile alerts about a little insect. Some
days we could use an alert to sort through which alerts are
important.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, we're less alert to alerts today. For a long
while last fall, every airplane overhead drew concerned looks. The
sight of tall buildings prompted spinal shudders. Pillars of smoke
didn't just mean fire. This is all part of coping, of the healing
process, which moves through different people at different speeds in
different ways. It's natural for the pain to subside some. A year
ago, many things we now recall vividly were then unthinkable.</TE>
<TE>   How very much has changed. Today and in the months to come, as
easy and as tempting as it will be to forget much, we need to be
alert not to. Both as a tribute to those gone and as a perpetual
warning to an America somewhat wiser about its vulnerability.</TE>

<HD>Arafat Disappoints--Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In June, a headline in an Egyptian newspaper read: "Arafat accepts
Clinton peace plan." Memo to Arafat: You're nearly two years too
late; Clinton isn't president any more.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinian leader was at it again this week, condemning
terror attacks on Israeli civilians but backing down from a call on
the Palestinian legislature to ban suicide attacks--two weeks after
his interior minister, Abdel Razak Yehiyeh, displayed more courage
and urged just that.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat's address to the Palestinian legislative council was his
first to that group in 18 months. It wasn't worth the wait. He
equated attacks against Israeli civilians with attacks against
Palestinian civilians. But there is no moral equivalence between
Israel's strikes on terrorist leaders that sometimes kill other
Palestinians in the area and the suicide bombers who enter a pizza
parlor or vegetable market intending to kill and maim as many Israeli
men, women and children as possible in order to spread terror.</LD>
<TE>   His speech did contain phrases about wanting to achieve peace with
Israel. "Enough of the struggle and bloodshed," he declared. But he
failed to denounce all terror attacks, limiting his condemnation to
assaults on civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Yehiyeh was forthright in proclaiming that suicide
attacks violated international law and harmed the cause of the
Palestinians. He's right. Terror bombings have pushed Israelis
formerly sympathetic to Palestinians into supporting crackdowns by
the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. They also have cost
the Palestinians international support.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians renewed their attacks on Israel nearly two years ago,
after Arafat surprised the world by rejecting the peace plan
President Clinton had helped the two sides work out at Camp David.</TE>
<TE>   There were further talks at Taba, Egypt, but Arafat again missed
an opportunity for substantive negotiations with Israel over
withdrawal from lands it has occupied since the 1967 war.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat appointed Yehiyeh interior minister several months ago and
ordered him to reorganize the authority's security services, which
are supposed to protect Palestinians and also stop Palestinian
terrorists from crossing into Israel to carry out attacks. Israeli
troops reoccupied most major Palestinian cities this year after waves
of bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has labeled Arafat "irrelevant" and President Bush has
called for new leaders as a condition for establishing a Palestinian
state in three years. Arafat is not helping the Palestinian cause by
continually missing opportunities for peace and a homeland for his
people.</TE>

<LD>On the day World War II ended, people of all faiths spontaneously
congregated at St. Vibiana's Cathedral in downtown Los Angeles. A
Jewish man who was there told Jack Miles, God's unofficial
biographer, that the ad hoc flock radiated gratitude and relief:
"They were mourning ... but they also felt at peace."</LD>
<LD>   Critics, professional and lay, have already said plenty about the
Los Angeles Archdiocese's new downtown cathedral as architecture and
art. The coming months will reveal just where the cathedral fits into
the civic landscape.</LD>
<LD>   The day after the official dedication, about 12,000 people showed
up at the controversial edifice. Some came to celebrate Mass. Some
came to worship in their own non-Catholic way. And no doubt many of
little or no faith came simply to see what all the fuss was about.</LD>
<TE>   The challenge for the Catholic hierarchy and the city is to keep
all these constituencies returning to this space that many, but not
all, view as sacred.</TE>
<TE>   The church will demonstrate its desire to be an ecumenical magnet
by holding an interfaith remembrance service today on the anniversary
of the terrorist attacks. Participants include the Board of Rabbis of
Southern California, the Buddhist Sangha Council of Southern
California, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the
Islamic Center of Southern California, the Southern California
Ecumenical Council, the Vedanta Society of Southern California, the
National Conference for Community and Justice and representatives of
the Bahai, Greek Orthodox and Sikh communities.</TE>
<TE>   Today's gathering establishes the dramatic new cathedral as
another sacred gathering point for Southern Californians. We hope it
also inspires the archdiocese to a bolder mission.</TE>
<TE>   Make that beautifully austere courtyard the place for a meeting on
the gang warfare that continues to terrorize this city. Once a year,
turn offices and meeting rooms into a state-of-the-art think tank for
addressing ways to help the mentally ill and addicted people living
on California's streets. Encourage people of all faiths and no faith
to gather for problem-solving sessions on the smog that chokes the
city's children. Bring people together to confront the ongoing
implosion of Los Angeles schools.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, generously make this new, boldly conceived space,
which Catholics hold sacred, significant to the entire city.</TE>

<HD>China Trip Hints at Tibetan Thaw</HD>
<DH>Asia: A visit to Beijing by two associates of the Dalai
Lama is the latest sign that the government might be loosening its
grip on the ex-kingdom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Two envoys of the exiled Dalai Lama have arrived in the Chinese
capital for a visit that observers say might signal an opening in the
diplomatic tussle over Tibet.</LD>
<LD>   The envoys came to Beijing on what the Chinese government insisted
Tuesday was an unofficial tour here and in Tibet to survey changes
and see relatives.</LD>
<LD>   But the two men, Lodi Gyari and Kelsang Gyaltsen, are close
associates of the Dalai Lama, raising hopes that their trip heralds a
thaw in the deep-freeze in relations between the exiled Nobel Peace
Prize laureate and the Chinese government.</LD>
<TE>   "His holiness the Dalai Lama is very pleased that the team is able
to make such a visit," the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala,
India, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The trip is the latest in a string of recent events that some
analysts see as a slight loosening on the part of the central
government, which has held Tibet in a tight grip for half a century
and claims it as an inalienable part of Chinese territory.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the government released six political prisoners
who had not yet served out their full sentences, including one
Tibetan, Tanak Jigme Sangpo, who had spent 19 years behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the Communist regime allowed a trip to China by the Dalai
Lama's brother, a frequent visitor to Beijing over the years who has
acted as an unofficial conduit between the two sides since official
contacts were cut off in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "When he came back, he reported that he felt very hopeful about
the possibility of dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama's
government," said Kate Saunders, a spokeswoman for the Tibet
Information Network in London. "That was a significant thing for
somebody like that to say."</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the Chinese government regards the Dalai Lama--revered
as a god-king by his followers--as a separatist intent on breaking up
"the motherland." Beijing says it will not resume talks with the
Buddhist spiritual leader unless he acknowledges that both Tibet and
Taiwan, another diplomatic bone of contention, belong to China.</TE>
<TE>   "On this basis, the central government can carry out talks with
the Dalai Lama about his individual future," Kong Quan, a spokesman
for China's Foreign Ministry, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Communication between the two sides has continued through back
channels, behind the wall of official mutual avoidance.</TE>
<TE>   There has also been growing pressure from outside the country, and
some say within it, for progress in the stalemate between Beijing and
Dharamsala.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the external pressure has come from the U.S. government.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin is due to visit President Bush in Texas
next month, for a one-day summit that Jiang is eager to see go
smoothly. It may be his last major diplomatic trip as China's No. 1
before a leadership reshuffle this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "We do see the trip of Lodi Gyari to Beijing and then to Lhasa
[the Tibetan capital] as a positive development, and we would hope
that it would lead to progress on dialogue," said State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher.</TE>
<TE>   The internal pressure springs from a debate on policy toward Tibet
within the Chinese government, between those who favor a tougher line
and those who advocate softer methods to keep Tibet bound to China.
One of those methods is massive economic aid, which Beijing continues
to pour into the region to develop roads, schools and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   The two envoys who arrived in Beijing on Monday are veteran
critics of China's rule over Tibet, which makes their visit all the
more surprising.</TE>
<TE>   Gyari, who is based for the most part in Washington, is affiliated
with the International Campaign for Tibet, an organization in the
U.S. capital that has not been shy in lambasting the policies of the
Chinese government.</TE>
<TE>   "The visit of Lodi Gyari is a very different ballgame" from past
visits by the Dalai Lama's brother, Saunders said. "He's very much an
influential power broker of the exile government and also very close
to the Dalai Lama. He's been based in Washington, so he's had
contacts with the State Department and Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The question remains what will be the follow-up," Saunders said.
"Is it just gesture politics, attempting to give America a concession
before Jiang's visit, or is it more substantial?"</TE>
<TE>   Recently, China has increased access for foreign reporters to the
former Himalayan kingdom. A group of such journalists is due to leave
Beijing today on a tour of Tibet--the second such trip arranged by
the government this year.</TE>

<LD>So much has been written and spoken about "closure" as this first
anniversary of 9/11 is upon us. Unfathomable closure occurred a year
ago when doors were slammed shut on thousands of lives not yet fully
lived, and illusions about national safety crashed along with the
planes that were turned into weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   We do not need closure. We need opening, so light can come through
as we transform images of death into memorials to those who once were
living. We need opening of minds and hearts so that peace can begin
with individual action, vigilance and the kind of compassion that
grows into a massive force for good. We need the light of
courage--the kind of courage that can allow us to face the dangers
inherent in the world and make intelligent decisions about ways to
make the world better through the people we nurture, the work we do,
the money we donate, a well-researched vote at our polling places or
activism on a larger scale. We will continue to grapple with our
reactions to Sept. 11. Let there be light.</LD>

<TE>   Rather than any kind of a monument at the World Trade Center site,
I would suggest re-erecting the twin towers. Any monument admits
defeat by the terrorists, while replacing the towers would be to
thumb our noses at them: "You may attack us, but we will survive and
rise again." Also, I can't think of a better tribute to those who
lost their lives in the disaster than to replace the towers. We can't
replace the victims but we can replace the towers.</TE>

<TE>   Am I the only one who is sick of hearing about how the brave and
stalwart citizens of New York rose to the horrible challenges of 9/11
with such historic, and apparently unprecedented, courage and
stamina? The events of 9/11 were a terrible tragedy. We get it. But
so were the bombing in Oklahoma City, the earthquakes in San
Francisco and Los Angeles, the destruction of the Pentagon, the
floods of the Midwest and many other national tragedies, yet I did
not hear the people of those cities proclaiming themselves somehow
separate and unequaled in their bravery, courage and determination.
They just got on with their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Not so New Yorkers. They are a breed apart, more intrepid and
noble than other Americans, supremely conditioned by lousy weather,
abrasive waiters and stinking subways to stand up to the challenges
of life. Perhaps if the media were not so entrenched in New York, the
barrage of self-praise would end.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, we have rallied together as a nation, come to
see New Yorkers as we never thought they could be, recognized the
heroics of many, raised billions for the surviving families and
cleared the site of the towers.</TE>
<TE>   We forced the Taliban out of power in Afghanistan, captured and
killed many of Al Qaeda, questioned the role of the Saudis as our
friends, detained and held Muslims for questioning, passed severe
laws that encroach on our rights of privacy, improved airline
security (questionable), spent billions on homeland security and
consolidated and improved intelligence operations.</TE>
<TE>   We have exposed accounting, investment and corporate fraud.
However, we failed to pass prescription drug, Medicare, health-care
coverage and Social Security legislation. We have watched housing
prices increase as investments and savings decline, seen the price of
gas rise again, failed to pass meaningful energy conservation
legislation and continued to use almost everything in excess.</TE>
<TE>   What is inconceivable to me is that as citizens we have done
little to reduce our dependence on oil on our own. We seem to think
that the government is going to do it for us. Now that we may be on
the verge of opening another front, in addition to our war on
terrorism, we may begin to stand up and participate in being
responsible for our future.</TE>

seniority, having lived with the true Sept. 11 for most of the last
century. I had it first.</TE>

<HD>Trying Children as Adults Is Barbaric</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am stunned that anywhere in our country young children can be tried
as adults and charged with first-degree murder with the only possible
penalty being a life sentence without parole ("Teen Brothers Guilty
of Beating Father to Death," Sept. 7). Yet this is just what happened
in Florida to Alex and Derek King, now ages 13 and 14 but certainly
younger when the crime occurred. It shames me as an American.</LD>
<LD>   This sort of justice seems like something out of the Dark Ages,
little removed from the lynchings in our past or the recent report
from Nigeria of a woman being sentenced to death by stoning for
adultery. At the same time, if the justice system ever manages to get
some of our highflying corporate bandits to trial and conviction, we
know that they certainly will face much lesser sentences.</LD>
<LD>   Thankfully, in the case of Alex and Derek, the jury convicted them
of a lesser offense, second-degree murder. It has been a long,
twisted road of media sensationalism, political demagoguery and
simplistic solutions that has gotten us to this deplorable place. We
need to wake up and change the priorities of our criminal justice
system. We are not barbarians.</LD>

<LD>Re "Davis Caught in Jaws of Two Latino Demands," Commentary, Sept. 9:</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis is a victim of his own pandering and the conflicts
arising from taking money from all sides. His greatest difficulty is
to remember or reconcile who bought him to go which way on what
issue. Now he is faced with, among other things, whether to veto or
sign a bill allowing illegal aliens to obtain a California driver's
license.</LD>
<LD>   It is so revealing that our unprincipled governor faced this
dilemma as we approached the anniversary of Sept. 11, a day that
brought home the perils of our porous borders and the lack of
meaningful monitoring of even legal entrants who overstay their
visas. In a sop to security, Davis now wants criminal background
checks as a condition of dispensing these licenses. Will that check
include the fact of the violation of our immigration laws, a crime in
itself?</LD>

<TE>   California voters are left with a choice between an incumbent who
devotes his career to recruiting, rewarding and repaying those who
purchase his office for him and an inept and inexperienced
businessman of questionable character who has more money than brains.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, those of us who do the actual voting come into the
process far too late to make any difference. If we vote and our
candidate wins, it doesn't matter because our wishes aren't
considered. If we don't vote, we have no right to object to the
status quo. Either way, we lose. Impotence leads to rage, and rage
leads to action.</TE>
<TE>   The time is ripe for a strong third party in this state to
represent those of us too poor to buy our own candidates.</TE>

must improve his campaign, not just for his own pride but because
voters in November deserve a real choice."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, voters do deserve a choice. Both major parties have failed to
put up competent candidates, so what's the alternative? Conservatives
should vote for Gary David Copeland of the Libertarian Party.
Liberals should vote for Peter Miguel Camejo of the Green Party.
Neither major party deserves our support!</TE>

<LD>Re "Airports in Scramble to Add Security," Sept. 9: In looking at the
sketches of the proposed construction, it seems that the area that
concerned me most on a recent and first flight since Sept. 11 is not
being changed.</LD>
<LD>   My concern was with putting my carry-on (one shoulder tote)
through the scanner with all of my documentation, including tickets,
billfold, digital camera, etc., then having to step to one side to be
wanded, while my tote sat at the end of the scanner--where anyone
could have picked it up and walked back out of the area.</LD>
<LD>   I am sure that most travelers are like me: concerned because we
set off the alarm, and fully involved in allowing the security person
to find what set off that alarm. It was only when I saw my tote being
crushed by other bags going through the scanner that it occurred to
me how lucky I was that it was still there. Have there been any
problems of this nature?</LD>

<LD>Regarding the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, hasn't anyone
heard of "beating a dead horse"? The building is built. The money is
spent and can't be taken back and spent somewhere else. Store lessons
for the future and make whatever good we can of what we have.</LD>
<LD>   I just wish people would stop saying "built to last 500 years"
(Sept. 3). This is still California, and that phrase feels like
deliberately teasing a God who has a habit of shaking us up to remind
us that humility is still a virtue.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For two days The Times has been preoccupied with the shooting deaths
of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. and law enforcement's alleged
failure to solve and prosecute their murders (Sept. 6-7). As one who
is retired from the LAPD, I can tell you that deep down the
detectives are thinking "good riddance" and asking why they should
spend valuable manpower and resources on these street thug-drug
dealers' deaths when so many innocent victims of crime cry out for
justice. Let these idiots kill off each other--who cares? Only their
mothers and other "gangsta thugs." We're all better off for it.</LD>
<LD>   Alan V. Weinberg</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your two-part story on the killing of rap star Tupac Shakur was an
excellent read. Times staff writer Chuck Philips tells a very
interesting story about the rap industry and its gang affiliations
and the incompetence of the Las Vegas Police Department's homicide
unit. Las Vegas Police Detective Kevin Manning is quoted in the Sept.
7 article, saying, "Tupac got the same treatment as any other
homicide here." If the other 167 murders investigated by Las Vegas
Police Department that year were handled in the same manner as
Shakur's, I wonder how many of those homicides were cleared.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Who Shot Tupac?" Sept. 6: Who cares? It's time people were
judged not by their "talent" but by their deeds as human beings. He
enjoyed violence; it gave him power. The world is better without him.

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County prosecutors were prevented Tuesday for the third time
from charging a former Oaks Christian Middle School principal with
child molestation because he remains jailed in Los Angeles County on
similar allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Andreas, 36, of Thousand Oaks was to be arraigned in
Ventura County Superior Court on 15 counts of lewd conduct with a
child for allegedly molesting a 13-year-old female student at the
school in Westlake Village. Andreas, however, did not appear for the
arraignment--the third such hearing scheduled so far--because he is
detained in the Los Angeles County Jail on $1-million bail on
suspicion of molesting two girls in that county.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kevin J. McGee set a new
arraignment date for Oct. 1.</LD>
<TE>   But Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Ridley said he did
not know whether the Los Angeles case would be resolved by then.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas was arrested in Thousand Oaks in July but released on
$250,000 bail. He was later arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department deputies.</TE>

<HD>Davis Signs Bills to Aid Families of 9/11 Victims</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Legislature sent hundreds of bills to Gov. Gray Davis at the
close of session last month. The governor has until Sept. 30 to veto
legislation, sign it or allow it to become law without his signature.</LD>
<LD>   Among the bills Davis has signed:</LD>
<LD>   * Victims--SB 1873 by Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier) allows the
state's victim compensation fund to cover the wages lost by families
of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as they
attend memorial services.</LD>
<TE>   AB 1746 by Assemblywoman Carol Liu (D-La Canada) gives free
University of California and California State University tuition to
the children of those killed in the Sept. 11 attacks. It also offers
a free community college education to the children of firefighters
and police officers killed in the line of duty.</TE>
<TE>   * Graves--SB 1448 by Sen. Wes Chesbro (D-Arcata) requires the
state Department of Mental Health to identify the gravesites of
patients who have died at state hospitals and developmental centers.
The department must also identify those patients whose remains were
donated to medical research. More than 16,000 people died at state
hospitals from the 1880s through the 1960s, and several thousand are
buried in unmarked graves.</TE>
<TE>   * Domestic partners--AB 2216 by Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder
Creek) gives partial inheritance rights to domestic partners
registered with the state. Current law prohibits a domestic partner
from inheriting any portion of a deceased partner's estate if there
is no will.</TE>
<TE>   * Scholarships--SB 1264 by Sen. Dede Alpert (D-Coronado) exempts
scholarships from counting toward family income under the state's
CalWORKs welfare-to-work program. The law ensures that students who
earn college scholarships won't see their family's public assistance
grant reduced as a result.</TE>
<TE>   * Tenants--SB 1403 by Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) requires
landlords to give their tenants at least 60 days' notice before
terminating a lease. The bill was inspired by the case of a Japanese
investor who evicted hundreds of families in Sacramento and Santa
Rosa this year with 30 days' notice.</TE>
<TE>   * Skateboards--SB 994 by Sen. Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) extends
until 2008 a law protecting public skateboard parks from liability
for injuries to users 14 years or older.</TE>
<TE>   * Used cars--SB 91 by Sen. Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont) attempts to
protect consumers from unlicensed "curbside" car dealers by
clarifying what car dealers can and cannot legally do.</TE>
<TE>   * Pawnbrokers--AB 2344 by Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim)
allows pawnbrokers to store pawned property off premises and to
notify customers of loan expiration by express delivery services
other than the U.S. Postal Service. It also clarifies what types of
fees are allowed in loan extensions.</TE>
<TE>   * Abuse--SB 1421 by Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles) allows the
victim of sexual abuse by a doctor or other professional during a
fraudulent physical examination to prosecute for rape.</TE>

<HD>Cross-Border Lifestyle Requires Patience</HD>
<DH>Impact: For thousands of commuters, added security since
Sept. 11 means longer waits to get to the U.S. side.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>Migdalia Escobedo refuses to let an international border stand in the
way of her sons' education, even in a post-9/11 world.</LD>
<LD>   Escobedo is among the Tijuana parents who cajole their children
awake at 4 and 5 a.m. to get them to San Diego private schools, a
generations-old tradition that has become a notorious ordeal.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. security measures imposed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks have turned the border--the heartbeat for countless lives and
livelihoods--into an unpredictable bottleneck.</LD>
<TE>   The morning rush-hour crossing into the U.S., once a 25-minute
wait, can now tie up motorists for an hour or more.</TE>
<TE>   Some private school students from Tijuana scramble out of carpools
on the Mexican side of the border, ride bikes to the crossing and
board new carpools on the U.S. side. Other parents move to San Diego
to spare their children the commute, and now endure long rides home
from jobs in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The border logjam ripples through societies on both sides of the
international line in other ways: Cross-border dating has reportedly
cooled, Tijuana trinket shops stand empty and San Diego
entrepreneurs--who rely on Mexican shoppers almost as much as
tourists--have lost regular customers and even businesses.</TE>
<TE>   But the impact of life after 9/11 is suffered most routinely by
the estimated 50,000 commuters who join the daily international conga
line to get to jobs and schools on the other side of the border.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a little girl, my mother used to send me across the
border to get a gallon of milk; it was that easy," said Escobedo, 54.
"Now it's stressful. You give yourself lots of time to get across,
and you're either very early or very late."</TE>
<TE>   Others, who cross for recreation, have cut back.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. partyers tend to walk across the border to Avenida
Revolucion, if they come at all: Tourism in downtown Tijuana
plummeted 40% last September and remains 25% off, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism elsewhere in Baja is recovering, officials say, as
Americans who fear flying drive to beach vacations south of the
border, especially since their hour-average wait at the border has
returned closer to pre-9/11 levels.</TE>
<TE>   Hugo Torres, owner of the Rosarito Beach Hotel--a popular
destination for Californians since it was a haunt for Lana Turner and
Vincent Price--said he lost 40% of his business for three months
after Sept. 11. But by this August, occupancy had surpassed that of
August 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd get even more tourists if the crossing was quicker," Torres
said.</TE>
<TE>   The border traffic jam is a big U-turn from the mid-'90s, when
crossing commonly took 20 minutes. Then young fronterizos, or
borderlanders, dropped across the border a few times a week to see
friends or paramours.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we ask ourselves, 'What's the wait?' I get tired just
thinking about it," said Marco Cortez, 32, a consultant for those
seeking U.S. government contracts.</TE>
<TE>   For some, an international singles lifestyle is on hold.</TE>
<TE>   "I was dating a girl in Tijuana, and after the third time of
coming back at 4 in the morning, I said, 'This is way too hard,' "
said Michael Inzunza, 30, the San Diego editor of a magazine for high
school students. His two brothers married Tijuana women after
cross-border dating forays. "You have to ask yourself: Is it worth
it?"</TE>
<TE>   For most people who cross the border all the time, the answer is
still a resounding yes.</TE>
<TE>   It is the fronterizos--bilingual Latino transnationals who spend
time on both sides of the border--who bear the brunt of "el crisis."</TE>
<TE>   "There are some people who just have to make it across, because
their families or jobs or schools depend upon it," said Chuck
Nathanson, executive director of San Diego Dialogue, a think tank
that advocates greater cross-border integration.</TE>
<TE>   The cross-border traffic is not all U.S.-bound.</TE>
<TE>   Some students from San Diego commute to schools such as Tijuana's
private Colegio La Paz. So many business owners drive from San Diego
to work in Tijuana that one U.S. border suburb, Chula Vista, is
nicknamed "Chulajuana."</TE>
<TE>   It's easy for these commuters to drive into Mexico, where border
screening is inconsequential. The problem is the U.S-bound leg.</TE>
<TE>   "The daily stuff is hard," Nathanson said. "People adjust, and
where they can cut down, they've cut down. But for some people, it's
a major economic liability. They go bankrupt."</TE>
<TE>   For private school students' parents, such as Mariano and Migdalia
Escobedo, the border is a family affair. Mariano, the chairman of the
Tijuana Tourism Board, and general director of Tijuana Jai-Alai, pays
close attention to how the border affects business.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the Escobedos mingled with other Tijuana parents at
Mariano's old San Diego alma mater, St. Augustine High School, for
freshman orientation for Mariano Jr., 15. Their youngest, Marco, 12,
attends seventh grade at another private institute, St. John School.</TE>
<TE>   The Escobedos have driven their kids across the border for 11
years.</TE>
<TE>   Now, construction workers and hotel workers begin lining up at the
San Ysidro border at 5 a.m., and crossing can take 90 minutes if you
pick the wrong lane or, as Migdalia said, "the cursed line."</TE>
<TE>   Even the San Ysidro pedestrian crossing commonly has lines of 500
to 1,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   "Some families I know have just given up and moved to Chula Vista
or Bonita," an adjacent community, Migdalia said.</TE>
<TE>   As difficult as the crossing remains at San Ysidro, where 125,000
U.S.-bound cars pass each day, it is a marked improvement from the
months immediately after last Sept. 11. The average wait is 50 to 55
minutes during the 5 to 9 a.m. rush, still double the 25 minutes
before 9/11, said Lauren Mack, spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in San Diego. But on Saturdays and Sundays,
the 60-minute wait is back down to pre-9/11 levels. August marked the
first month San Ysidro traffic returned to pre-9/11 levels, Mack
said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the long delays had discouraged so many drivers that car
traffic fell by 30% to 40%--a drop so severe that many merchants
north of the border in San Ysidro said they might have to go out of
business.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Vasquez, the president of the San Ysidro Business Assn.,
said he tried unsuccessfully to get a state of emergency declared.
The city of San Diego held bilateral economic impact hearings, and
helped businesses apply for Small Business Administration Economic
Injury Disaster loans.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a ghost town," said Vasquez, owner of several small
border hotels and a Mexican auto insurance business--which he said
lost 70% of their revenue in the months after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Many business are still just hanging on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Commuters have adapted, pushing ingenuity to the limits. They
check Internet sites that show the cars, creeping like ants across
the border, to determine which lanes are least crowded. So many
people began riding bikes through the lanes--weaving ahead of stalled
cars--that the INS added a bike lane in the spring in San Ysidro.</TE>
<TE>   Hector Venegas, border coordinator for the San Diego Assn. of
Governments, is married to a Tijuana woman, and he crosses the border
regularly for baptisms and other family events.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, Venegas said, he sees people sleeping in their cars in
the wee hours at the San Ysidro crossing. They park in lanes closed
during low-volume hours, poised to wake up at the front of the line.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have to be at work at 5:30 a.m. at an Escondido nursery,
you have no choice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The economic fallout has underscored what some economists say is a
shared economic destiny at the border: Mexican shoppers spend nearly
$3 billion in San Diego every year, an amount not far behind the
roughly $5.1 billion spent in 2001 by tourists there, city planners
say.</TE>
<TE>   Marney Cox, the chief economist of the San Diego Assn. of
Governments, said Mexicans are still buying big-ticket items in San
Diego but staying in Tijuana for many smaller purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "You might wait an hour or two in line to buy a car in San Diego,"
Cox said, "but not to go grocery shopping or to a restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   About 21,000 regular border crossers, such as the Escobedos, have
been able to shortcut the border ordeal by passing a security
clearance that allows them to get an electronic transponder. With the
transponder, they can use a special lane that whips them past the
typical customs and immigration scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   But the program, called SENTRI, authorizes individual families and
their household cars--not the random daily assortment of children in
school carpools like the Escobedos'.</TE>
<TE>   That means Migdalia Escobedo must stop at the border so the other
children in her carpool can walk through the pedestrian line--even if
those kids are registered on their own family's SENTRI--and pick the
children up on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials frown on allowing children younger than 14 to walk
through pedestrian lines without an adult--and no one wants to lose
the prized electronic pass.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of people talk about Life Before SENTRI and Life After
SENTRI," Migdalia said. "There's a lot of jealousy of people who have
SENTRI."</TE>
<TE>   "My son says: 'A bicycle costs $100. A car costs $10,000. SENTRI
is priceless,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Dialogue's Nathanson said much of the border snarl could
be unknotted if the program simply were expanded.</TE>
<TE>   "After eight years, they only have 21,000 people in SENTRI, and
they ought to have 200,000," Nathanson said. "The people who cross
every day are not terrorists, but they put everybody through the same
protocol, like the little old lady at the airport who you make unpack
her bags.... They should be spending their time inspecting people
they don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Mack, the INS spokeswoman, said a top priority for the agency is
processing the backlog of about 8,000 SENTRI applications.</TE>
<TE>   Fronterizos say that, without speedier crossings, more than
commerce or convenience has been lost.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Luis Rangel, a DJ at Radio Latina, a Tijuana soft rock
station, lives in Tijuana, where rent and living costs are lower, and
drives to work in Chula Vista, from which the station broadcasts.
"Before, I'd pop over to San Diego for a movie, a concert, to see my
friends and family," he said. "Now I think twice. My friends in San
Diego are reluctant to come to Tijuana, too. It reduces the social
spontaneity."</TE>
<TE>   But when people get a taste of cross-border living, many are
willing to put up with a lot to keep their international options
open.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Arredondo, 37, a photographer in rumpled jeans and a
mustache, was one of dozens of Tijuanans who sampled herbal drinks at
a reception for Tijuana artists at the Museum of Contemporary Art in
San Diego on a recent night. Arredondo works in San Diego, lives in
Tijuana and socializes everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I've spent my whole life going from one side of the border to the
other," he said. "I can't imagine being forced to choose between
them."</TE>

<HD>Police Probe Astronaut's Fist Launch</HD>
<DH>Violence: Buzz Aldrin apparently was provoked before
hitting a moon-landing skeptic, Beverly Hills authorities say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin apparently was lured to an interview
with a video maker who claims the moon landings never took place and
then was "poked" repeatedly with a Bible before he hit the video
maker in the face, Beverly Hills police said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Bart Sibrel, 37, of Nashville, Tenn., said he plans to file a
criminal assault complaint against the 72-year-old astronaut and will
sue him for civil damages. But Beverly Hills police Lt. Gary Gilmond
said just who committed assault Monday night will be investigated.</LD>
<LD>   Gilmond said police will interview both men and file a report with
the district attorney's office.</LD>
<TE>   Aldrin's attorney, Robert O'Brien, said the astronaut, who lives
in Westwood, "was forced to protect himself and his stepdaughter when
he was aggressively confronted" outside the Luxe Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien said Sibrel, whom he described as 6 feet 2 inches tall and
weighing 250 pounds, "intercepted" Aldrin, who weighs about 160
pounds and is 5 feet 10 inches, and physically blocked him from
leaving.</TE>
<TE>   Sibrel had a different story. "I never poked him, never physically
touched the guy," he said, asserting that his cheek was swollen and
that he had been advised to get an X-ray.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides said there is a video that will support their version.</TE>
<TE>   Sibrel said he was trying to get Aldrin to swear on the Bible that
Aldrin had gone to the moon. Sibrel said he had tried before to get
six astronauts to swear similarly, but none had agreed to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Sibrel said that a Japanese company was shooting a film at the
Luxe on the authenticity of the moon landings and that he was "a
surprise guest" on the show, arriving with his own video team. He
said Aldrin was not told in advance Sibrel would be there.</TE>
<TE>   Sibrel has made and is peddling a 37-minute video entitled "A
Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon," which accuses NASA of a
hoax in claiming that it sent men to the moon.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmond said Aldrin went to the hotel thinking that he was going
to be interviewed by a Japanese educational television station, and
had no idea Sibrel would be there.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Aldrin then left the interview when he found out what it was
all about, but was followed by Mr. Sibrel," Gilmond said. "[Sibrel]
poked Mr. Aldrin repeatedly with the Bible, telling him to repent,
and pushing the Bible in his face."</TE>
<TE>   Although the astronaut did hit Sibrel, Gilmond said, the video
maker apparently wasn't injured. Aldrin left before police arrived,
Gilmond said.</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Hills officers who came to the scene were "biased"
against him, Sibrel said Tuesday. "A couple of police when they
arrived were already calling me a liar, and they hadn't even talked
to me yet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Citing his journalistic credentials, Sibrel said he had worked for
two years at a Nashville television station, WSMV. However, station
news director Mark Shafer said Sibrel "only worked for the station as
a part-time editor for two months eight or nine years ago, and he has
no right whatsoever to claim any association with our news
organization."</TE>
<TE>   At NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, a spokeswoman, Eileen
Hawley, said, "We have a lot of respect for Buzz Aldrin, but he no
longer works for us. The only thing I can tell you is we did land on
the moon, and this incident [in Beverly Hills] has nothing to do with
NASA at all."</TE>

<HD>Irvine's Voters May Get Say on CenterLine</HD>
<DH>Transit: The City Council proposes a ballot on the rail
line, target of a new initiative campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing an initiative campaign by opponents of the proposed CenterLine
rail project, the Irvine City Council on Tuesday offered to have
residents decide whether the city should participate in the commuter
train system.</LD>
<LD>   The council proposed giving voters the option of ending the
project outright or allowing portions to be built. The city would
abide by the results of an election to be held before June 30, 2003.</LD>
<LD>   "We are genuinely trying to structure a process where the public
can be heard," said Mayor Larry Agran, who has repeatedly said that
city residents would get to vote on CenterLine.</LD>
<TE>   Over the weekend, opponents of the project launched an initiative
campaign to halt the light rail route through Irvine. They hope to
gather enough signatures to qualify the initiative for a possible
March special election.</TE>
<TE>   "This [motion] is another in a series of surprises and an attempt
by the City Council to manipulate the situation in their favor," said
John Kleinpeter, chairman of the Find Alternatives Instead of Rail
Transit, an anti-CenterLine group based in Irvine. "They know our
initiative is a serious threat."</TE>
<TE>   The motion for the citywide vote, made by Councilwoman Beth Krom
and seconded by Agran, came as the council considered a plan to
shorten the 18-mile light rail line by more than six miles and locate
the southern terminus at UC Irvine. Debate on that vote continued
late Tuesday night as proponents and opponents testified during a
public hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The council's approval is necessary to finalize the alignment of
the line's first leg, which in turn will allow the Orange County
Transportation Authority to apply for federal funding by a Sept. 16
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The change means the route will not reach the Irvine Spectrum or
the Irvine Transportation Center. OCTA approved the line's truncated
version Monday.</TE>

<HD>Chino Fire's Smoke Seen Across Southland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A huge, low-slung black cloud of smoke billowed across western San
Bernardino County on Tuesday after a fire broke out at a building
insulation company in Chino.</LD>
<LD>   The smoke could be seen from Los Angeles, about 50 miles away. It
towered into the sky, but also combed the top of nearby one-story
buildings.</LD>
<LD>   The fire erupted at 2 p.m. in a large storage yard at the
Insulfoam plant in Chino. One firefighter was treated at a local
hospital for smoke inhalation.</LD>
<TE>   Damage was estimated at $2 million. The cause of the fire was
under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials said the burning material that created all the
smoke was plastic insulation.</TE>
<TE>   Using water cannons, more than 50 firefighters quickly surrounded
the blaze and knocked it down by 4 p.m. Businesses abutting the
Insulfoam plant were evacuated, but the fire never damaged any of
them, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The nearest homes are about a mile east of the fire, said Tony
Landin, a spokesman for the Chino Valley Independent Fire District.</TE>
<TE>   Residents were told to stay indoors because most smoke, regardless
of the material being burned, is harmful, Landin said. Pilots were
asked to steer clear of the smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Tacoma, Wash.-based Insulfoam, part of Premier Industries Inc.,
manufactures expanded polystyrene, which is used as insulation in the

<DH>Students from urban high schools spend a week on UCLA
campus and learn about careers in science and math.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a pristine biochemistry lab on the UCLA campus, a group of high
school students crowded around researcher Gloria Turner to inspect a
bright orange fungus growing inside a glass tube.</LD>
<LD>   "Aw, cool!" said Omar Oliva, 16, when it was his turn to hold the
tube and its odd-looking cargo, which Turner uses to study amino acid
metabolism.</LD>
<LD>   Others passed the tube with hardly a glance at its contents. But
Omar turned it end to end, then looked around the airy lab, its
gleaming benches and pipes snaking overhead. "If I don't make it with
engineering," he told the white-coated researcher, "maybe I'll want
to do this."</LD>
<TE>   Turner nodded, smiling. "There's a lot still to be discovered in
science," she said. "When you make your choices about what to do,
think about what really excites you in school and then just ... go
for it!"</TE>
<TE>   These 19 students, most from families without a tradition of going
to college, were taking part in an innovative, one-week immersion
program to entice them to think about college and perhaps about
careers in science and math. Most, like Omar, were from Roosevelt
High in Boyle Heights or from Jordan High in Watts--schools in poor
urban areas with low test scores, where many drop out.</TE>
<TE>   Selected on the basis of good grades, steady attendance in school
or a recent marked improvement in either area, the students spent a
warm summer week at UCLA, living in the dorms and taking an intensive
course in personal and career development. That was all free to them,
along with a unit of college credit and even a $50 credit at the
campus bookstore.</TE>
<TE>   They met with professors and hung out with students. They learned
about community colleges and how to transfer to four-year schools
like UCLA. They took tours of the Westwood campus and made excursions
to its bookstore, computer labs and ocean discovery center at the
Santa Monica pier.</TE>
<TE>   Both in the classroom and outside it, the program's message was
clear: Dream. Work hard. Go to college. Think ahead. And almost
anything is possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We give them a taste of university life and a lot of tools and
support," said Maria Elena Yepes, director of the learning assistance
center at East Los Angeles College, which sponsors the program, along
with UCLA. "And we tell them over and over again that they have the
ability; they can do this."</TE>
<TE>   The maxim seemed to be sinking in.</TE>
<TE>   By the second day, Christian Gama, 17, who said he had never
really considered anything but community college, was starting to
dream about UCLA. A spiky-haired senior at Jordan High, Christian
said he wanted to study biology, perhaps, or oceanography.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like this campus," he said. "It's a beautiful campus,
and it makes you feel great just to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Funded primarily with federal grant money through the city of Los
Angeles' Youth Opportunity Movement, the math-science immersion
program is one of a number of efforts at UCLA, USC and other area
schools to ease the often difficult path to college for students from
tough neighborhoods and underachieving schools.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, Yepes said, the parents of such students are new
immigrants or did not attend college themselves. They are often
unable to help their children sort through the maze of requirements
for high school graduation or college attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the students may think about going to college, but some
aren't aware that they lack the tests or courses required to enroll
at the schools of their choice, Yepes said.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, East L.A. College and UCLA collaborated on several
such intervention projects, including two sessions of the new
math-science program for about 50 high school students, and another,
for community college students, that is focused on humanities or
social sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another on-campus program, this one a shared effort with West
L.A. College, also began at UCLA this summer, said Alfred Herrera,
director of UCLA's center for community college partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   With several of the programs now in their fourth year, Herrera
said he is pleased with their success, based on the responses of
participating students and anecdotal evidence that a number of those
who took part in the first few sessions are making their way back to
UCLA as students.</TE>
<TE>   Data to assess the programs' actual effects are being collected
and will be available in a few months, Herrera said. "But it looks
like we're starting to make a difference," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And of course, Herrera said, it doesn't hurt to have UCLA, with
its distinguished academics and sprawling, tree-studded campus, to
provide inspiration to any who need it.</TE>
<TE>   Other inspiration--and role models--for the students in the
math-science program came from their peer mentors, many of whom
transferred to UCLA from local community colleges. Instructor Daniel
Ortega, now an East L.A. College counselor, provided still more.
Ortega, 28, is an alumnus of both ELAC and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish we'd had something like this when I went through," Ortega
said. "It's got to help." He taught the students about good study
skills--among them, "Don't study in bed!"--along with college and
career exploration.</TE>
<TE>   The students moved on from Ortega's class to a session with UCLA
biochemistry professor Richard L. Weiss, who urged them to consider
careers in science or technology. He told them that many graduate
student spots in the two areas are filled by foreign students or
remain empty, while medical schools have too many applicants.</TE>
<TE>   "There's incredible opportunity and need for people in this
country who know something about science," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Omar asked Weiss what classes he should take if he wanted to major
in electrical engineering, but grimaced comically at the answer:
"Math, math and more math," the professor said. "The basis of all
science is math."</TE>
<TE>   "OK, OK," Omar answered, laughing along with his classmates. "I
can do that."</TE>
<TE>   Walking back toward the shaded campus courtyard where they would
have lunch, he and other students talked about the program.</TE>
<TE>   Mayra Caldera, 17, who goes to Roosevelt, said she enjoyed
learning from Weiss and others about what she would need to take to
get into college and to succeed there. "In high school, you don't get
motivation like that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Christian said he liked the glimpse of adult freedom and
responsibility that the week provided, especially the chance to live
in the dorms.</TE>
<TE>   And Omar said he enjoyed walking around the peaceful campus during
the day and at night, too. "You don't see scary people walking around
here," he said. "Here, everybody's saying, 'Hi.' "</TE>

<HD>Enrollment Rising at State's 2-Year Colleges</HD>

<LD>Despite class cutbacks intended to curb enrollment in some districts,
the number of students in California's community colleges has climbed
this semester, further straining crowded campuses.</LD>
<LD>   The enrollment crunch is expected to prod community colleges
throughout the state to limit class offerings this year and turn away
even more students.</LD>
<LD>   "After a while, you run out of options. You can only get that
class size so large before it becomes irresponsible to make it
bigger," said Thomas J. Nussbaum, chancellor of the California
community college system.</LD>
<TE>   Nussbaum released a preliminary estimate Tuesday that fall
enrollment statewide is up 6.9%, or more than 115,000 students, from
a year earlier. If that gain proves accurate, it would be the biggest
percentage increase in 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   Many community college administrators expressed doubt that the
actual increase will turn out be that large; the estimate was based
on a survey taken in late August, before some schools' fall classes
began. But they agreed that enrollment has jumped.</TE>
<TE>   The financial pressure is particularly intense on the Los Angeles
Community College District, despite cutbacks in class offerings. The
district said its latest figures show that enrollment is up 8.6% from
a year ago. That is far less than the 13% it estimated just three
weeks ago, but still enough to squeeze its nine campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "We're packing more people into classes than ever before, and we
already were overenrolled," said Marshall "Mark" Drummond, chancellor
of the Los Angeles district. Many students who have enrolled for the
semester but have been shut out of classes, he said, "will probably
get frustrated and drop out fairly soon."</TE>
<TE>   One of the hardest-hit campuses is Los Angeles Mission College in
Sylmar, where the latest figures show fall enrollment up 13.1%.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of our classes are a little packed," said Baltazar Martinez,
the 22-year-old student government president. He said his classes
have grown from up to 30 students last year to, in some cases, 35 or
more this year.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, some students who have tried to sign up since the
semester began last week for English, math or child-development
courses are finding themselves out of luck. "Classes are filling up
faster than they did last year," Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   It is a similar story at East Los Angeles College in Monterey
Park, which is reporting an enrollment increase of 10.25%. Richard
Anderson, chairman of the speech and theater department, said one
benefit has been that classes that in past years have been hard to
fill are enjoying enrollment increases in the 20% to 50% range.</TE>
<TE>   Campuswide, the average class size has climbed to nearly 32
students, up from just over 28 students at the same time last year.</TE>
<TE>   Other cuts are looming because of tight budgets. Sharon Tate, the
college's dean of academic affairs, said the school this semester
probably will trim tutoring services, student jobs and supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the rest of the state has been hit with rising enrollment,
too. "It spans the urban and suburban schools," said Linda
Michalowski, a spokeswoman and lobbyist for Nussbaum's office.</TE>
<TE>   Some fast-growing districts said they can handle the extra
students. College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita expects to serve
13,700 students fall, up about 8% from last year and double the level
of six years ago. In that period, the number of class sections
offered has risen from 682 to more than 1,600. "We've built in a lot
of capacity," said Dianne G. Van Hook, the college's
superintendent-president.</TE>
<TE>   Even at College of the Canyons, class sizes will climb and some
students won't be able to take courses at convenient times. "For
community college students, that can be a real challenge because many
of them work full time and have families," Van Hook said.</TE>
<TE>   In California and across much of the nation, enrollment has grown
as a result of the boom in young people reaching college age, rising
tuition at public four-year universities and laid-off workers seeking
to develop new job skills.</TE>
<TE>   But community college officials and higher education analysts said
that, just as the demand for education at two-year schools has
sharply increased, hard-pressed state governments are clamping down
on spending.</TE>
<TE>   Educators said the emerging response--denying access to students
by cutting classes--is wrenching for the colleges, which provide
higher education, at low cost, to virtually all comers.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to keep the doors of access open as long as possible,"
Nussbaum said.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Seeks Ways to Slash Budget by $57 Million</HD>
<DH>Government: Officials consider offering early retirement
packages to 1,080 managers but expect only 10% to 20% to accept.
Departments are asked to identify cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with a budget shortfall, Orange County officials Tuesday said
they intend to offer early retirement packages to more than 1,000
workers and asked departments to identify more cuts.</LD>
<LD>   The county must slash $57 million from its operating budget
because of sagging tax revenue and reduced funding from the state.</LD>
<LD>   Contributing to that shortfall is a $55-million deficit in the
county's annual payroll because of rising employee pension costs.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County's problems mirror a statewide budget crunch among
municipal governments. Retirement plans approved during the stock
market boom of the late 1990s are now coming back to haunt public
agencies, including Orange County's pension system, as the stock
market has swooned.</TE>
<TE>   The county expected that the pension system's investments would
yield an 8% gain last year, but the system instead saw a 3% loss, and
county government must make up the difference.</TE>
<TE>   The County Executive Office has proposed granting two years of
service credit to 1,080 management employees with at least 10 years
of service and who are 50 or older.</TE>
<TE>   About 10% to 20% are expected to take the offer.</TE>
<TE>   Those positions would then be frozen, although "critical jobs"
would be filled with the approval of Chief Executive Officer Michael
Schumacher.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to further cut costs by streamlining the services that
county departments provide.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher has asked department heads to identify essential core
services, including programs mandated by law, said Diane Thomas, a
county spokeswoman. The chief executive's staff is looking to save up
to $40 million by having departments focus on these core services.</TE>
<TE>   However, officials said that it's too early to tell what services
might be eliminated or reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Some county department heads expressed alarm Tuesday over the
possible cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Elections officials, for example, have expressed concern about how
the loss of employees would affect preparations for the November
election."My concern is, 'Wait a minute here,' " Assessor Webster J.
Guillory said. "I understand that they need to save some money. But
the bottom line is these employees in my department are not only
experienced, they're licensed by the state board."</TE>
<TE>   "I would be losing about 400 to 600 hours of legal experience, and
I can't do that in 90 days," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the county assessor's office's 300 employees, about 52 are
eligible for early retirement, Guillory said.</TE>
<TE>   In response to these worries, Supervisor Tom Wilson postponed a
board vote on the plan until Sept. 25. "We have to have a strategy to
address our budget issues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And, we want to approach it very methodically to make sure the
[adoption of] this strategy doesn't impact our government services."</TE>

<TE>   At a Glance</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County retirement system's $4.5-billion investment
portfolio has taken it on the chin:</TE>
<TE>   * Loss -- The system assumed an 8% annual gain on its investments
in the last fiscal year but suffered a 3% loss.</TE>
<TE>   * Proposal -- Michael Schumacher, the county's chief executive
officer, has proposed an early retirement program, granting two years
of service credit to 1,000 management employees.</TE>
<TE>   Who's eligible -- Employees who are age 50 or older and have
worked for the county at least 10 years.</TE>

<HD>Wrinkles Seen in Dress Policy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The idea seemed simple enough: Students should dress for success, not
as though they're going to a nightclub.</LD>
<LD>   But a week after Granada Hills High's dress code was instituted to
weed out inappropriate attire, some parents and students contend that
school officials are inappropriately enforcing the policy.</LD>
<LD>   Some students said they were told to bend over for school
administrators to see if their shirts still touched the top of their
pants. Other students said they were asked to raise their arms to see
how far their tops rode up. Girls showing too much cleavage, midriff
or leg were sent to detention. Boys with overly baggy pants found
themselves in violation. One girl contacted the American Civil
Liberties Union to see if any civil rights had been violated.</LD>
<TE>   Granada Hills Principal Brian Bauer said the policy, a reaction to
the fashions inspired by pop stars such as Britney Spears, was never
intended to humiliate students, adding that the alleged incident in
which a girl was asked to bend over for a female administrator was
never corroborated.</TE>
<TE>   Bauer said teachers and administrators were told not to ask
students to bend over, but instead encouraged them to talk to
students privately about dress or body appearance issues.</TE>
<TE>   But some parents were still concerned about the way the policy was
being enforced. "It's ridiculous," said Jim Govea, whose 17-year-old
daughter was given detention for revealing too much skin at her
waist. "You have male teachers going up and down the school looking
at these girls. Who knows what's in their heads?"Other parents, like
Sonja Eddings Brown, found the dress code necessary. Brown is a
member of the school's community council that spent eight months
drawing up the policy. "Girls were coming to school in halter tops
with short, short skirts and not even any underwear," she said. "It
wasn't hygienic and it wasn't respectful or safe."</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills High, known for its strong academic standing,
followed other district schools by banning such items as tube tops,
spaghetti straps, visible cleavage or underwear, baggy pants, pocket
chains, studded jewelry and hats that were not official school caps.</TE>
<TE>   Twelfth-grader Crystal Mahoney said she thought she knew what to
expect when she and her parents received a letter over the summer
with drawings depicting dress code violations. But she said she was
mortified when, in front of a group of students in the detention room
last week, she was told to bend over by a female staff member to
determine how short her shirt was.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not supposed to wear sexy clothes to school," said the
17-year-old cheerleader, who did not tell administrators about the
incident. "But I became more of a sexual object when I had to bend
over. It's contradictory."</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU of Southern California said it is looking into the dress
policy following a student's complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very concerned about what we heard if these reports appear
to be true," said Peter Eliasberg, managing attorney with the ACLU.
"It could be a gross violation of law and an invasion of privacy."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Guthrie, secondary vice president of United Teachers-Los
Angeles, said she agrees with the dress code, but "teachers should
not be fashion police."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District has no uniform dress code,
but most campuses have developed their own, mainly to prohibit the
wearing of gang colors. But with new fashions come new rules.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard right now," said Kitty Dustin, an assistant principal
at Eagle Rock High School, which recently added new rules about
midriff exposure. "Most girls are just buying current styles. Also, a
lot of times, students don't look the same way at school as when they
left home. By midday, it's 90 degrees and the tank tops are out."</TE>
<TE>   On the first day of school last week, 84 Granada Hills students
were given detention for violating the dress policy. On the second
day, the number dropped to 65, and by Tuesday morning, only four
students were found in violation. Bauer said the overwhelming
majority were girls.</TE>
<TE>   When a violation is found, parent volunteers call the student's
parents, asking them to bring in different clothes or take their
child home. If the parent does neither, the student is given a
T-shirt that reads "GHHS/Dressed for Success" to wear.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be difficult to go out and replace clothes," said
Rebecca Olkowski, who drove to school last week to take her daughter,
Kazia, 15, a different skirt, only to have it rejected as too short.
"When I was in [high] school in the 1970s, we wore mini-skirts,
fishnet stockings and go-go boots."</TE>
<TE>   School officials said that the majority of parents support the new
rules.</TE>

<HD>Two College Students Drown</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two college students drowned in heavy surf off Dockweiler State Beach
in Playa del Rey late Monday night despite the efforts of police
officers who pulled them from the waves and performed CPR.</LD>
<LD>   Kenitha Saafir, 24, of Compton and Kristin High, 22, of Los
Angeles, both seniors at Cal State Los Angeles, were at the beach
with a group of other women when they were swept under, police said.</LD>
<LD>   High's family said Tuesday that they believe that the young mother
died after a sorority hazing ritual. But police said they had no
evidence to support that notion.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a rite of passage that turned into a rite of death," said
Holman Arthurs, 25, High's fiance and the father of their 2-year-old
son. "They were blindfolded. This is a hazing stunt gone bad."</TE>
<TE>   But police said Tuesday that they were investigating the deaths as
accidental drownings. "No one was blindfolded. No one was tied up,"
said Officer Jason Lee.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Low winds and steady help from water-dropping aircraft allowed
firefighters to gain the upper hand on a stubborn brush fire that
burned for a second day along the steep slopes of the Verdugo
Mountains above Glendale, fire officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "The fire isn't heading anywhere," Glendale Fire Capt. Thomas
Marchant said. "It's just a matter of getting around what's burning
at this point."</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said the 1,100-acre fire, which they described as
being of suspicious origin, was about 70% contained by late Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Crews were concentrating on putting out hot spots and clearing
brush, they said.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 600 firefighters, double the number Monday, were
stationed across the foothills between Glendale and La Crescenta on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Three firefighters were hospitalized with minor injuries,
including heat exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   Two Super Scooper airplanes, two tankers and four helicopters
rained water on the flames, halting their advance despite worries
early in the day that the fire would triple in size because of
conditions that included 90-degree temperatures, low humidity and
rugged, inaccessible terrain.</TE>
<TE>   Beaudry Terrace resident Steve Wind watched the action just over
the ridge behind his home.</TE>
<TE>   ''I took pictures of this mountain yesterday, and it looked like a
nuclear bomb had gone off,'' the graphic designer said.</TE>
<TE>   Wind, who has lived in the neighborhood for about a year, said he
was concerned about living in an area with a lot of brush.</TE>
<TE>   "I always look around and say to myself, 'If fire hits these
hills, we're in trouble.' But what are you going to do?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I like seeing the big Super Scooper planes coming by. As long as
they're dropping water, I feel reasonably safe."</TE>

<HD>Council OKs Garcetti for Ethics Panel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council unanimously confirmed former L.A. County
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti on Tuesday as the first elected official to
serve on the city's 11-year-old Ethics Commission.</LD>
<LD>   During Garcetti's appearance before the City Council, on which his
son is a member, Councilman Nate Holden strongly denounced the Ethics
Commission as racist.</LD>
<LD>   Holden, who has been fined $34,000 for campaign finance
violations, joined several other council members in praising Garcetti
as an impartial addition to the semi-independent panel responsible
for monitoring lobbyists and politicians' fund-raising, but he
accused the commission and its staff of harassing and intimidating
officials and their campaign contributors.</LD>
<TE>   "When you look at the record of that commission, it appears they
almost selectively--selectively--go after minorities," said Holden,
who is black. He represents the Crenshaw area, Koreatown and Wilshire
Center and must leave office next year because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   "The commission's record and Mr. Holden's record speak for
themselves," said LeeAnn Pelham, the Ethics Commission's executive
director. "It's sad that Mr. Holden feels the need to express his
anger in such an irresponsible way."Garcetti, who was district
attorney for eight years before losing a reelection bid in 2000,
responded Tuesday that he would keep Holden's complaints in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I can bring a fresh perspective and maybe some common
sense" to the commission, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti's son, Eric, a city councilman representing Hollywood and
neighboring areas, recused himself Tuesday from voting on his
father's appointment. His father said he will recuse himself from any
matters involving his son.</TE>
<TE>   Council President Alex Padilla nominated Gil Garcetti to serve a
five-year term on the five-member Ethics Commission. To fill the
commission's remaining vacancy, City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo has
nominated Uri Herscher, a rabbi and president and chief executive of
the Skirball Cultural Center.</TE>

<HD>Barry White Sings Out for His Old Neighborhood</HD>
<DH>Protest: He joins Rep. Waters and others in opposing
bulldozing more than 70 homes and part of park for a proposed new
high school in South Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI and SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As fans tapped on the tinted windows of Barry White's limousine
Tuesday, the soul singer inside pointed toward a row of homes in Los
Angeles' South Park neighborhood near Avalon Boulevard and 51st
Street.</LD>
<LD>   "I have beautiful memories here. I used to live two blocks away. I
just don't want it destroyed," said White, known for his resonant
baritone on such "make-out" hits as "Can't Get Enough of Your Love,
Babe," and "You're the First, the Last, My Everything."</LD>
<LD>   More than 70 homes there could be bulldozed to make way for a new
Los Angeles Unified School District high school currently under
study. A small slice of the park where White played dominoes as a
teenager, got into brawls after school and played music on Halloween
might also become part of the new campus.</LD>
<TE>   White joined nearly 300 community activists, ministers and
residents Tuesday afternoon in a demonstration at the park led by
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) to protest the district's
proposal. After the rally, about 60 protesters boarded buses and
headed to the district's downtown headquarters where a school board
meeting was being held.</TE>
<TE>   White did not go downtown, but Waters did, and she got into an
angry exchange there with school board member Genethia Hudley Hayes.</TE>
<TE>   Waters said the school plan would destroy homes that "should have
been designated historic landmarks a long time ago." Waters told
board members that the neighborhood supports new schools, but not by
demolishing housing, which is in much demand. She suggested building
on empty lots or spaces where abandoned buildings now stand.</TE>
<TE>   Hudley Hayes chided Waters for coming to speak on the project so
late in the planning process. The exchange was a rare public display
of animosity between two of the city's most powerful African American
elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been interested in briefing you about South Park, but we've
gotten no response from your office," Hudley Hayes said. "We're glad
you're interested now."</TE>
<TE>   According to Kathi Littmann, L.A. Unified's director of new
facilities, the district tried to avoid taking homes, but there are
few alternatives in densely populated South-Central Los Angeles.
Industrial properties are much more difficult to clean up than
residential sites, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She added that the high school plan, which has not yet been
approved by the school board or reached the point of property
acquisition, would preserve most of the park's open space. A new
school and a refurbished park could help rejuvenate a neighborhood
that used to be home to other famous musicians besides White,
including Dizzy Gillespie and Nat King Cole, Littmann said.</TE>
<TE>   White, who will be 58 on Thursday, lived in South Park with his
mother and brother from age 10 to 17. He developed his love for music
there and sang in a local church choir. At age 11, he played piano
for R&amp;B artist Jessie Belvin.</TE>
<TE>   At 16, he sang and played piano for a Los Angeles band called the
Upfronts.</TE>
<TE>   White harbors bittersweet memories, too. In 1983, his brother was
shot dead in the neighborhood, a victim of gang violence.</TE>
<TE>   "When I look over here, I can [remember] people who used to be
living," he said, "including my brother."</TE>
<TE>   White alleged that the city and school district want to destroy
the neighborhood after neglecting it for so long.</TE>
<TE>   "The people are getting older and dying and leaving. But to me,
some things are sacred, and this is one of them," White said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, White addressed a crowd at the park, where he was swarmed
by fans wanting photos and autographs. A loudspeaker played some of
his hits.</TE>
<TE>   Before his driver steered the limousine off the park's grass, he
said: "It's the same song, baby. Every time."</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Blake's attorneys asked the state Supreme Court on Tuesday to
order an immediate bail hearing for the actor, who has been charged
with murder, solicitation of murder and conspiracy to commit murder
in the death of his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley.</LD>
<LD>   Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Lloyd Nash has said he will not
consider the bail issue until Blake's preliminary hearing Nov. 13.</LD>
<LD>   In asking the Supreme Court to order an immediate hearing, lawyers
for the 68-year-old actor, who starred in the 1970s television series
"Baretta," contend that the evidence against him is "flimsy."</LD>
<TE>   Bakley was shot to death in her car May 4, 2001, outside a Studio
City restaurant where she and the actor had dinner. Blake has been
held without bail since April 18.</TE>

<LD>A former high school basketball coach was sentenced Tuesday to three
years in prison for having sex with a 15-year-old girl on the school
basketball team.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Calvin Clark III was convicted in June of two counts of oral

<HD>Lawyer Accused of Murder Fled Debts, Attorney Says</HD>
<DH>Trial: Hugh McDonald, formerly of Newport Beach, killed a
client's wife, then faked a leap off a bridge, prosecution says.
Defense says he isn't the killer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors on Tuesday described attorney Hugh "Randy" McDonald as a
manipulative man who murdered his client's wife, abandoned his family
and then faked his death by pretending to jump off the Golden Gate
Bridge.</LD>
<LD>   But on the first day of McDonald's murder trial in Santa Ana, his
attorney offered a far different picture of the former Newport Beach
lawyer.</LD>
<LD>   McDonald, Michael Molfetta said, was overwhelmed by trying to keep
up with the "Newport Beach lifestyle." In debt and depressed, he
drove to the Golden Gate Bridge but at the last moment decided not to
jump. Instead, the attorney said, McDonald started a new, simpler
life in Utah, unaware he was wanted for murder.</LD>
<TE>   The sharply diverging views come more than a year after McDonald
was arrested in the shooting death of a Villa Park woman.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Walt Schwarm told the seven-man, five-woman
jury that McDonald chased Janie Pang around her home on May 30, 1997,
with a gun and fatally shot her. A housekeeper fled the house with
Pang's children and ran next door to call police. Officials found
Pang dead in a closet, crouched in the fetal position.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarm did not offer a motive for the murder but pointed out that
Pang's husband, Danny, was a client of McDonald's law firm. At the
time of the murder, Pang owed the firm $20,000, of which McDonald was
to receive $4,000, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald fled to the Bay Area three days after the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, he placed his watch with his business
card attached on the ledge of the Golden Gate Bridge to make it look
like he jumped off. But Schwarm said it was a ruse designed to make
authorities think he was dead so he could start a new life in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   That same day, McDonald's wife (they've since divorced) received a
Federal Express package from him that contained two cassette tapes,
documents transferring property ownership and two books on how to
cope with suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Police eventually tracked McDonald down in Utah, but he left
before they could arrest him.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested last year in Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   But Molfetta said that McDonald isn't a murderer and that he left
Orange County to escape depression and a loveless marriage. He denied
the lawyer ever tried to disguise himself.</TE>
<TE>   The defense says several witnesses, including the maid and Pang's
6-year-old son, pointed to another man during a photo lineup.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald fled because his wife "wanted to live in Newport Beach
where she could live the life that Randy wanted nothing to do with,"
Molfetta said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not running from law enforcement," Molfetta said. "He's
running from his life in Newport Beach."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's ex-wife, Karen, testified for the prosecution Tuesday,
saying the family was going through financial hard times when her
husband disappeared. They owed $65,000 in credit-card debts and had
to come up with tuition for their daughter's school.</TE>

<HD>Group of County Nurses Demands Bonus</HD>
<DH>Labor: Those who work in acute care already get the pay
differential. Others call for equity.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Most of the 300 nurses who work for Ventura County government receive
a bonus that boosts their pay by $1.88 an hour. Now, the remaining
nurses want it, too.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing before the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, the nurses
said that if the pay differential is good enough for some, it is good
enough for all.</LD>
<LD>   "This bonus was given to the other nurses several years ago, yet
not to us," said Tim Yett, who works at an outpatient mental health
clinic. "We are in the largest nursing shortage in history, and you
do not want to drive more nurses away."</LD>
<TE>   A pay differential is just one of several contentious issues that
have arisen as nurses bargain for a new county contract, said Norrita
May, a spokeswoman for the California Nurses Assn. The union
represents 300 nurses in the county's hospital, public health
facilities and outpatient clinics.</TE>
<TE>   May said the nurses will return to the board's hearing room next
week to make their case for higher pay. On average, the county's
mental health nurses are paid 17% less than nurses in surrounding
counties, May said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been at the table since April and we have a ways to go,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the county began offering a "special assignment" bonus to
nurses who work at Ventura County Medical Center, its public
hospital. Higher pay was the only way to fill vacant slots, said
Barbara Journet, human resources director.</TE>
<TE>   "We were having a major nursing shortage and that was a way to get
nurses to come into the hospital," Journet said.</TE>
<TE>   Nurses in the psychiatric ward and at public health and ambulatory
care clinics got the extra pay later, she said. However, the county
does not want to extend the bonus to nurses in outpatient mental
health clinics because those jobs are easier to fill, Journet said.</TE>
<TE>   If pay were equal, hospital nurses would likely ask to be
transferred out because acute care is exhausting, she said, adding
that about a dozen nurses are seeking the differential.</TE>
<TE>   County government's pay currently ranges from $56,700 a year for
an experienced registered nurse to $61,600 a year for those who work
in surgical units.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, the average salary of a registered nurse in 2000 was
$46,400, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In
California, the average was $56,140.</TE>
<TE>   Shortages of skilled nurses have peaked and ebbed over the years.
Right now, the supply is at a historic low, Journet said.</TE>
<TE>   County negotiators will keep that in mind as they bargain with the
union, she said. But they must also take into account the county's
generally bleak financial outlook.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors earlier this year approved $17 million in cuts to
programs and jobs, mainly from vacant positions.</TE>
<TE>   More cuts may be coming as officials tally how much the county has
lost as a result of reduced funding in the state's recently passed
$99-billion fiscal plan.</TE>

<HD>County's Alert Status Is Orange-Plus</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Officials here add an extra degree of caution.
San Onofre can withstand airplane attack, facility spokesman says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From Disneyland to the San Onofre nuclear power plant, Orange County
authorities--already on heightened alert for today's anniversary of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks--said Tuesday they were adding an
extra degree of vigilance as the nation was put on increased threat
watch.</LD>
<LD>   Officials for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station took pains
to say the plant four miles south of San Clemente was strong enough
to withstand the type of airplane attack that brought down the World
Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   "We've done some engineering analysis since Sept. 11, where we
looked at weights of commercial airlines, speeds, fuel capacity,
resulting fires and impacts," said Ray Golden, a spokesman for the
Southern California Edison facility. "We are highly confident that if
a similar scenario was attempted by terrorists on our facilities it
would not result in releases of radiation."</LD>
<TE>   Golden was responding to videotaped remarks by Al Qaeda terrorists
released this week that claimed the initial targets considered for
last year's attacks were nuclear facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Word that the national alert status was upgraded from yellow to
orange reached local agencies in a variety of ways. The Orange County
Sheriff's Department learned of it from an FBI Teletype bulletin,
while San Onofre officials heard from the governor's emergency
preparedness office.</TE>
<TE>   "We sent out a notice to all of our employees letting them know of
the general change in the level of threat, so we could have an even
more vigilant extra 2,000 pairs of eyes and ears on our property,"
Golden said. The U.S. Coast Guard is enforcing no-fly and no-boating
zones around the nuclear power facility, which sits at the ocean near
the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton.</TE>
<TE>   Other agencies were on guard as well.</TE>
<TE>   "We are on higher alert in terms of the cognizance that something
might happen at a prominent facility, such as John Wayne Airport,
county buildings, San Onofre or elsewhere," said Lt. Lloyd Downey,
watch commander at the county Emergency Operations Center, a central
disaster response site tucked into Loma Ridge at the mountainous
eastern edge of the county. "Even El Toro Marine Corps Air Station,
although it is closed; we have county personnel out there."</TE>
<TE>   If a bomb scare or other threat is received, sheriff's deputies
will swarm the site with extra personnel, Downey added.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim police and personnel also were on heightened alert,
monitoring everything from the Angels' baseball games to Disneyland
and the convention center, city spokesman John Nicoletti said.</TE>

<HD>Man Admits Guilt in Meth Blast, Fraud Case</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>--From a Times staff writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Ana man pleaded guilty Tuesday to causing a methamphetamine
explosion in which he was badly burned, then defrauding an insurance
company to get paid for the injury.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Martinez, 34, is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 11 for
manufacturing the drug, insurance fraud and theft, said Deputy Dist.
Atty. Vickie Bridgman, who prosecuted the case. Under a plea bargain,
she said, Martinez will serve three years, eight months in prison</LD>
<LD>   On Feb. 4, 2000, Martinez was burned over 60% of his body in a
fire caused by the explosion of a methamphetamine laboratory at the
Zapopan Panaderia in the 400 block of Euclid Street in Santa Ana.
While still in the hospital, where he spent more than four months,
Martinez filed a worker's compensation claim against the bakery, his
employer at the time of the explosion.</LD>
<TE>   He has agreed to dismiss the claim and pay $40,000 in restitution
for money he received as a result of that claim, Bridgman said.</TE>

<HD>Breakers Oust Artists in Laguna Beach; Are Poets and Banana
Slugs Next?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Artists nickname has been given the brushoff by students at
Laguna Beach High. Gone, too, is the school's symbol: a painter's
palette and brush (which none of the teams displayed, anyway). Now,
the school's athletes will be called the more formidable-sounding
Breakers, the name that drew the most votes in a student ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The city's Coastline News reported that Bryce Loidolt, a member of
the student senate, led the move to change the nickname. Oh, yes,
Loidolt takes part in another activity--he's a safety on the football
team. Where will it all end? I hope the demise of the Artists doesn't
threaten the existence of such other refreshingly unmacho team
nicknames as the Poets (Whittier College), the Anteaters (Irvine),
the Banana Slugs (UC Santa Cruz) or, across the border, the Fighting
Artichokes (Scottsdale [Ariz.] Community College).</LD>
<LD>   A little privacy, please! This month's City Talk, the
always-exciting newsletter of the city of Paramount, tells of a man
who was upset after being pulled over for driving a stolen car.
Officers said the driver seemed less agitated about his impending
arrest, however, than about having his possessions placed on the roof
of the car--especially a bottle of Viagra.</LD>
<TE>   Good thing Jake can't read: Columnist colleague Will Rogers tells
me that his Airedale, Jake, got into a scrap with another hound,
underwent surgery and then was put on antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers is optimistic about Jake's recovery, despite the directions
imprinted on the prescription bottle: "Jake: One tab daily till
goner" (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Unreal estate: Brian Bolling of Manhattan Beach sent along a
listing for a property with one unspoiled feature that might catch
the eye of an outdoorsman (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Memorial Day weekend gets longer every year: Kathleen Sheldon and
Stephen Tarzynski of Santa Monica stayed at a hotel that was laboring
under the wrong impression about the name of the latest holiday (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Beached: So why was that aging, somewhat shabby-looking
27-foot-long sloop sitting on concrete outside the Society of St.
Vincent de Paul headquarters in L.A.? Someone had donated the craft
to the charity's gift shop. And, a few days later, someone else
bought it for $500. The unusual sale represented a nice haul for the
society's outreach projects and, added spokesman Brian Pickering, "it
freed up three parking spots in our lot."</TE>
<TE>   Getting even: I asked for readers who've come up with imaginative
ways of dealing with those endless e-mails from mysterious
individuals in Nigeria and other countries promising millions of
dollars. Well, Dr. Sidney Kahn says he's programmed his computer so
that when he receives one of these offers, he can forward all the
spam he has to the get-rich-quickster, as well as materials about
spam investigations. I like the concept: Share the spam!</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: The city of Whittier (and, of course, its college)
were named after 19th century poet John Greenleaf Whittier. Hence,
the team nickname. Soon after the city's founding, Whittier was
offered a free lot if he would move to the Southern California city
from Massachusetts. He never even visited.</TE>

<LD>"This ain't no 45,000 traffic," Abdul says, pointing down Gene Autry
Way, directly across State College Boulevard from one of the Edison
Field entrances.</LD>
<LD>   Autry Way is as quiet as an empty dugout. What that tells Abdul is
that the Angels won't be selling out their 45,000-seat ballpark. Not
on this night. If they were, he'd have more business on this prime
stretch of ground where ticket scalpers hawk their wares.</LD>
<LD>   It's 90 minutes before Monday night's supposedly big game against
the Oakland A's, and I had the silly idea the Angels might actually
sell out for the opener of the four-game series. After all, the
Angels sport a 10-game winning streak and the first-place A's have
won 22 of 23.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels' first playoff appearance since 1986 beckons. They
could go to the World Series and, maybe, win it.</TE>
<TE>   And the fans are where, exactly?</TE>
<TE>   "Angel fans are fickle," Abdul says, standing on the curb on Autry
Way. In L.A., he points out, "If the Dodgers had a 10-game winning
streak, they'd have 56,000 every night." Abdul is confident this will
turn out to be a good week for ticket scalpers in Anaheim, and yet,
on this first night of the series ...</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to have a World Series in your pocket to get the fan
base," he says, referring to the Angels' notable lack of one in their
41-year history. Abdul (scalpers tend to work on a first-name-only
basis) says he'd given thought to spending the week in San Francisco
for the Dodgers-Giants series, but figured, "Why do that when we've
got the Angels and A's here?"</TE>
<TE>   A possible professional miscalculation, because the teams drew
only 28,145 on Monday night--far short of a sellout and roughly the
same crowds drawn in Cleveland, Denver and Chicago for home teams
long ago buried in their divisions. The Giants-Dodgers game drew
40,000-plus, just shy of a sellout.</TE>
<TE>   A bit farther down Autry Way, Emanuel is supervising operations.
He says he has been in the ticket business for more than 20 years,
although I could swear on another occasion he told me 30 years. The
point is, he has sold tickets to people of all races, colors, creeds
and baseball loyalties.</TE>
<TE>   "Angel fans are different than the rest of the league, period,"
Emanuel says. "If it sells out tonight, it'll be mostly because of
Oakland fans living here or coming down from Oakland. Angels fans got
too much else to do, and they've been let down too many times. They
don't want to be disappointed. They don't want to show their loyalty
and then feel stupid for showing loyalty."</TE>
<TE>   I'm guessing Emanuel doesn't have a doctorate in psychology, but
is he right? Is this all about self-esteem?</TE>
<TE>   Angel fans clamor for a serious contender, and Disney has given
them one. The team has played great ball, but the locals still act as
if they want guarantees their hearts won't be broken down the
stretch.</TE>
<TE>   They missed some good theater Monday night. In the plaza just
outside the stadium gates, a radio deejay sounds a pregame battle
cry: "Miguel Tejada, Miguel Teschmada," he says, mocking the A's
shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   An hour before game time, the scant business at the walk-up window
proves Abdul a prophet: There will be no sellout.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the stadium, 79-year-old Claire Hoskins of Fullerton waits
for grandson Geoff Moore to return from a food run. Hoskins has high
hopes but says he's not an avid fan--a characterization that after
being relayed to Moore almost produces a spit take from his grandson.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask my grandmother if he's an avid fan," Moore, 32, says. "The
baseball season alters their TV viewing habits."</TE>
<TE>   OK, so Hoskins is playing it cool. I ask how he'd handle another
Angels team that came up short.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be disappointed, but it won't ruin my life," he says. "I
always figure there's another year coming up."</TE>

<HD>Pearlee Toliver; 'Jewel of the Dial' Had Radio Show in
Louisiana</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pearlee Toliver, the Louisiana radio personality called the "Jewel of
the Dial" and revered for her homespun commercials as much as for the
gospel records she played, died Monday of a heart attack in Monroe,
La. It was her stated wish that her age never be revealed in print.</LD>
<LD>   For a mere $15, Toliver would script and deliver ads as part of
her patter in discussing music. Her poor diction, awkward phrasing
and dropped letters only added to her appeal. Touting a local bail
bondsman, for example, she would urge: "Don't sit there in jail all
day and all night with your feet swelling all over your shoes, and
you worrying and crying and wanting to go home to your family. Call
Diddy Bop. Diddy Bop will be there in the next 15 minutes to get you
out of jail."</LD>
<LD>   Born to sharecroppers in Drew, Miss., Toliver served in the
Women's Army Corps toward the end of World War II and then became
manager of a gospel group called the Jordan Singers. They landed a
radio show in Monroe, and after the group broke up, Toliver was told
she could take over the program if she could find her own sponsors.
The recently widowed Toliver was sufficiently motivated to walk into
local stores and persuade owners to pay her $15 for a radio
commercial.</LD>
<TE>   Her weekly Sunday morning show grew from 15 minutes to two hours,
with the last recorded episode broadcast the day before her death.
Her patter gained a national audience as cassettes of her show were
circulated by fans, including country singers Loretta Lynn and Andy
Griggs. Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top included her voice in one of the
band's albums.</TE>

<HD>Worldwide Concert Will Honor Slain Journalist</HD>
<DH>Dedication: Event will open with a folk festival Oct. 6 in
Encino, where Daniel Pearl grew up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Slain journalist Daniel Pearl loved music, and to honor him, the
Daniel Pearl Foundation is launching a worldwide concert on Oct. 10,
the day he would have turned 39.</LD>
<LD>   "He always carried an instrument with him wherever he went," said
Judea Pearl, Daniel's father.</LD>
<LD>   Kicking off the international event will be a free folk music
festival Oct. 6 in Encino, where Pearl grew up.</LD>
<TE>   "Every one of the artists who is coming is dedicating a song to
Danny," said Elaine Weissman, executive director of the California
Traditional Music Society, sponsor of the festival.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter who was kidnapped and slain
by terrorists in Pakistan in January, was an accomplished violinist,
fiddler and mandolin player.</TE>
<TE>   The Daniel Pearl Foundation, established by his family in April,
"promotes cross-cultural understanding through journalism, music and
innovative communications," its literature states.</TE>
<TE>   When the Pearl and Weissman children were growing up, the families
often celebrated Passover together, Weissman said, "and my most
poignant memory of our Passover Seder was Danny playing the 'Four
Questions' on the violin."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel switched from the violin to the fiddle and then to the
electric violin, perfectly suited for jazz improvisation. He mastered
the mandolin when he fell in love with folk music, around the time he
joined the staff of the Wall Street Journal, his father said.</TE>
<TE>   "That repertoire swept him away from classical," said Pearl, who
plays the guitar and conducts the Los Angeles Hebrew Choir.</TE>
<TE>   "In every town he was stationed, he would form a group or join a
group," Pearl said. "I think it was his way of making friends."</TE>
<TE>   When Daniel went to a new city, even for a day or two, he would
find a local club and get on stage and perform. He played at parties
and treated his newspaper friends to impromptu recitals when they
were working late. He also gave free violin lessons to needy
youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   The Encino event is an ideal way to launch the international
Daniel Pearl Music Day, his father said. The San Fernando Valley
community was where Danny went to school and where he played soccer.
And as the foundation brochure says, "music was an essential form of
expression for Danny."</TE>
<TE>   "He means a lot to people who grew up here in Encino, and it's
very natural to have the kickoff here," Pearl said.</TE>
<TE>   The free daylong festival will take place from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
in and around the music society's Center for Folk Music in Encino
Park on Ventura Boulevard, a block west of Balboa Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   A 90-by-32-foot wooden dance floor will be set up under the trees
for contra dancing, a traditional form of couples dancing that has
found new popularity.</TE>
<TE>   There will be nine main acts, with half-hour performances, as well
as an area for jamming that Weissman described as "a mixture of
Scottish, Irish, old-timey bluegrass and Paraguayan harp music."</TE>
<TE>   Orchestras and other ensembles in more than 50 cities will
remember Daniel Pearl on or around Oct. 10, including groups in Hong
Kong, Shanghai, Bangkok, Goa, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, London and Boston,
his father said. More information about the commemoration is
available at www.danielpearl.org.</TE>
<TE>   No particular repertoire is recommended for Daniel Pearl Music
Day, his father said. "Everything is acceptable. Danny was very
inclusive. His range was very wide."</TE>
<TE>   In New York City, Pearl said, an orchestra plans to play
Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony, a piece with special resonance for
Pearl. It was performed in honor of Daniel by the Israeli
Philharmonic Orchestra in Tel Aviv on Feb. 22, after the world
learned that he had been slain.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli-born Pearl said guest conductor George Pehlivanian
told him afterward: "That was the first time I understood the triumph
of hope over despair."</TE>

<HD>Seeking More Safety for Pedestrians</HD>
<DH>Transportation: In response to Times study, councilman
calls for effort to stem accidents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned that pedestrian safety is often sacrificed for improved
traffic flow, a Los Angeles city councilman called Tuesday for
improvement projects in neighborhoods where there have been many
fatal pedestrian accidents.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Eric Garcetti said his motion was introduced in
response to a Los Angeles Times analysis last month that found that
pedestrian deaths were clustered in high-density minority
communities, including several neighborhoods in his district.</LD>
<LD>   The motion instructs transportation officials to report to the
council in 45 days with new pedestrian safety measures for those
communities "even if their use may have flow impacts on automotive
traffic."</LD>
<TE>   The Times analysis of more than 2,500 pedestrian deaths from 1993
to 2001 found that fatal pedestrian accidents usually occur in
densely populated neighborhoods bisected by wide, crowded boulevards
that are used as alternatives to congested freeways. Those
neighborhoods include Echo Park, Hollywood, Westlake, Boyle Heights
and south Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Times analysis also concluded that pedestrian safety
improvements--such as flashing lights, highly visible crosswalks and
reflective signs--are often lacking in neighborhoods with the most
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that many of the neighborhoods plagued by fatal
pedestrian accidents are in Garcetti's council district. Those
neighborhoods include the areas around Vermont Avenue in Hollywood,
Alvarado Street near Sunset Boulevard in Echo Park, and Santa Monica
Boulevard and Western Avenue in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Garcetti said he would like the city's Department
of Transportation to test new pedestrian safety efforts in what he
calls danger zones. Some of these improvements could include adding
highly visible crosswalks, imposing new restrictions on right turns
and extending curbs to slow down vehicles near intersections, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti, who lives in Echo Park, also suggested adopting
pedestrian overlay districts in some of these neighborhoods. An
overlay district would impose zoning rules to encourage the
installation of landscaped sidewalks, narrower streets and more
sidewalk cafes.</TE>
<TE>   "It does slow traffic but it improves business and gives
pedestrians a fighting chance," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti said his district has long suffered from a
disproportionate number of pedestrian accidents. He began to consider
some changes after reading The Times' analysis last month.</TE>
<TE>   He decided to push ahead with his plans after an Echo Park
resident was struck crossing Glendale Boulevard this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Pedestrian advocates commended Garcetti for pushing pedestrian
safety even though some improvement efforts will mean slowing traffic
flow.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very excited," said Deborah Murphy, founder of L.A. Walks, a
pedestrian advocacy group. Murphy is also a member of the city's
pedestrian advisory committee.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy and other pedestrian advocates say transportation engineers
usually emphasize moving traffic through residential streets, often
at the expense of pedestrian safety.</TE>
<TE>   John Fisher, assistant general manager of the Department of
Transportation, said many of the ideas proposed by Garcetti are
already used throughout the city. Still, he said, his department will
study ways to reduce deaths in those neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "We will look in our toolbox to address pedestrian safety," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Ventura May Ban Feeding of Wildlife</HD>
<DH>Nature: City Council requests a draft ordinance in a bid to
stem the rodent population along the beachfront. Animal lovers
protest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling the rodent population along the beachfront a threat to public
health, the Ventura City Council has decided to prepare a draft
ordinance that would ban people from feeding wild animals within city
limits.</LD>
<LD>   The council's unanimous decision Monday was met with dismay from a
handful of residents, who for the past 18 months have been regularly
feeding the ground squirrels and seabirds along the Ventura
Promenade--as well as, inadvertently, the rats.</LD>
<LD>   Lorraine Freeman, a registered nurse, said the rodents and other
wildlife are a tourist attraction, and that discontinuing the animal
feedings would be inhumane.</LD>
<TE>   She scoffed at the idea that the rodents pose a health threat and
vowed to defy any feeding ban, even if it meant going to jail. She
accused the city of attempting to eradicate the beachfront rodents
through "species cleansing."</TE>
<TE>   But city officials maintain that the feedings have resulted in an
overpopulation of rats and squirrels, irritating beach residents and
raising fears about the spread of disease.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this summer, several rats were tested for plague. Although
the results proved negative, officials remain concerned about the
potential health threat.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Neal Andrews, who sponsored the proposed feeding ban,
said the city has received numerous complaints about people feeding
the rodents. While his proposal does not call for extermination, it
would ban people from feeding wild animals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an assassination program," Andrews said. "The fact
is, this feeding led to the burgeoning of a species that are clearly
undesirable."</TE>
<TE>   During the hourlong hearing, several residents joined Freeman in
complaining about Andrews' proposed ordinance, chastising officials
for their perceived disregard for animal life.</TE>
<TE>   But residents of a condominium complex along the beach disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   Roland Cordobes, one of the residents, blamed the feeders for his
building's rat infestation and said he was tired of people treating
the rodents "like endangered species."</TE>
<TE>   Other speakers urged the council to examine alternatives to an
outright feeding ban. Bill Allen, a longtime Ventura resident, said
he enjoys taking his grandchildren to the Promenade to feed the sea
gulls and pigeons.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't really believe you would consider enacting an ordinance
prohibiting a citizen from feeding one of God's creatures," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he suggested looking into the possibility of relocating
the animals and creating a wildlife sanctuary farther up the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The council voted to direct city staff to draft an ordinance and
present it for consideration before the end of the year.</TE>

limits.</LD>
<LD>   The council's unanimous decision Monday was met with dismay from a
handful of residents, who for the past 18 months have been regularly
feeding the ground squirrels and seabirds along the Ventura
Promenade--as well as, inadvertently, the rats.</LD>
<LD>   Lorraine Freeman, a registered nurse, said the rodents and other
wildlife are a tourist attraction, and that discontinuing the animal
feedings would be inhumane.</LD>
<TE>   She scoffed at the idea that the rodents pose a health threat and
vowed to defy any feeding ban, even if it meant going to jail. She
accused the city of attempting to eradicate the beachfront rodents
through "species cleansing."</TE>
<TE>   But city officials maintain that the feedings have resulted in an
overpopulation of rats and squirrels, irritating beach residents and
raising fears about the spread of disease.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this summer, several rats were tested for plague. Although
the results proved negative, officials remain concerned about the
potential health threat.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Neal Andrews, who sponsored the proposed feeding ban,
said the city has received numerous complaints about people feeding
the rodents. While his proposal does not call for extermination, it
would ban people from feeding wild animals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an assassination program," Andrews said. "The fact
is, this feeding led to the burgeoning of a species that are clearly
undesirable."</TE>
<TE>   During the hourlong hearing, several residents joined Freeman in
complaining about Andrews' proposed ordinance, chastising officials
for their perceived disregard for animal life.</TE>
<TE>   But residents of a condominium complex along the beach disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   Roland Cordobes, one of the residents, blamed the feeders for his
building's rat infestation and said he was tired of people treating
the rodents "like endangered species."</TE>
<TE>   Other speakers urged the council to examine alternatives to an
outright feeding ban. Bill Allen, a longtime Ventura resident, said
he enjoys taking his grandchildren to the Promenade to feed the sea
gulls and pigeons.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't really believe you would consider enacting an ordinance
prohibiting a citizen from feeding one of God's creatures," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he suggested looking into the possibility of relocating
the animals and creating a wildlife sanctuary farther up the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The council voted to direct city staff to draft an ordinance and
present it for consideration before the end of the year.</TE>

<HD>Davis Sets Calif.-Ariz. Land Swap in Motion</HD>
<DH>River: The changing course of the meandering Colorado
requires adjustment of the border between the two states.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>No border is fixed if it's a river, and the Colorado River has
outmaneuvered the bureaucracies of two states.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Gov. Gray Davis cleared the way for human laws to catch
up to natural laws by signing a bill--AB 2092 by Assemblyman David
Kelley (R-Idyllwild)--that allows California to get back the nearly
six square miles of its land that now lie in Arizona, thanks to the
river's wanderings.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona wants its land back, too. In May, Gov. Jane Dee Hull
signed legislation that clears the way for Arizona to reclaim 10
square miles that now lie within California.</LD>
<TE>   "We might as well get our lands in our state and let Arizona have
their lands in their state," said Alan Hager, a California deputy
attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   The land at stake is dry riverbed known as "sovereign" land.
Before 1963, California and Arizona drew their boundary down the
center of the bed of the Colorado River, from roughly Bullhead City,
Ariz., to Yuma, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, natural forces and the engineering works of the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation drove the river to twist itself into and out of
loops. It left behind old channels to which each state claims half.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually the landowners came to a position where they didn't
know if their lands were in California or Arizona," said Jim Frey, an
attorney with the California State Lands Commission.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, the states and Congress fixed a new boundary that would
no longer shift with the river's course. But in agreeing to the new
boundary, the states did not give up their claims on the dry,
abandoned riverbed. So the old territory, which is owned by the
people of Arizona and California at large, is scattered north and
south of the official state border.</TE>
<TE>   California and Arizona have been feuding over the water of the
Colorado River since 1935, when Arizona sent a militia armed with
machine guns to stop the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California from building a dam to divert water near Parker, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   But with land, not water, at stake, both states seem intent on an
amiable consolidation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think both states recognized that because of course changes in
the river, because of how things have developed over time with
respect to the river flow, we both needed to engage in some cleanup,"
said Nick Simonetta, spokesman for the Arizona State Land Department.</TE>
<TE>   The land swap could take years as lawyers slice through the legal
thicket of jurisdiction over navigable waterways. Rivers might at
first glance seem to make simple, clear boundaries, but that's not
necessarily so.</TE>
<TE>   Texas and Oklahoma, for example, battled for decades after the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1923 that Oklahoma's territory extended
to the "gradient line" along the Red River's south bank. It took
surveyors to delineate that line, which kept shifting. The "Texoma
Area Boundary Agreement" was signed in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In California and Arizona, the little islands of alien territory
along the old river course must be appraised before they can be
swapped. "The great majority of it is rocky, sandy river-bottom-type
land with typical Mojave scrub vegetation," Simonetta said. "There
may be some potential for [agriculture] there ... but we don't have
specifics on it."</TE>
<TE>   What's really at stake, Hager said, is a bureaucratic imperative.</TE>
<TE>   "Not that this is the greatest problem for the whole world," he
said, "but for those who love symmetry ... it's easier to have your
own sovereign lands in your own state rather than somewhere else."</TE>

<LD>A 17-year-old junior at Marysville High School has been diagnosed
with meningococcus meningitis, Yuba County health officials said.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second case in less than a week in which a Northern
California student has been diagnosed with the highly contagious
infection, which causes inflammation of the spinal cord and brain
fluids, and can be fatal.</LD>
<LD>   Last week a Galt High School senior was diagnosed with bacterial
meningitis. School officials said Monday that the female student was
in stable condition in a local hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Marysville school officials said those who had close contact with
the student were receiving antibiotics, and all parents have been
given information about meningitis.</TE>

<LD>County Supervisor Peg Pinard and Mothers for Peace want plans for
expanded radioactive waste storage facilities at the Diablo Canyon
nuclear power plant suspended until security is improved.</LD>
<LD>   In a petition filed Monday with the federal Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Pinard and the anti-nuclear activist group claimed that
security at the Avila Beach plant must be significantly upgraded to
thwart Sept. 11-style terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   An NRC licensing panel was holding hearings this week in Shell
Beach on the so-called dry-cask storage facility at Diablo Canyon.</LD>
<TE>   "The new reality must be reflected in what we build and how we
build it," Pinard said.</TE>

<HD>Judge Asked to Toss Out Simon Verdict</HD>
<DH>Court: The candidate's firm argues that its fraud
conviction was based on insufficient evidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The investment firm of Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon
Jr. made a final push Tuesday to persuade a judge to toss aside a
fraud verdict that has damaged his campaign.</LD>
<LD>   At a Superior Court hearing in Los Angeles, Judge James C.
Chalfant said he had reached his decision but would not make it
public until Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A jury found in July that William E. Simon &amp; Sons defrauded Paul
Edward Hindelang in a deal to take control of his Van Nuys pay phone
company, Pacific Coin.</LD>
<TE>   Brad D. Brian, a lawyer for the Simon firm, told the judge Tuesday
that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that a business deal did not work out does not make
fraud," Brian said.</TE>
<TE>   But Hindelang's lawyers asked Chalfant to uphold the verdict
against the Simon firm and its partners. The jury levied $78 million
in damages against the Simon firm and $19 million in damages against
its partners.</TE>
<TE>   "There is more than enough evidence of fraud by these people,"
said Hindelang's lawyer, Anthony C. Duffy.</TE>
<TE>   Chalfant offered no clear sign of his decision.</TE>
<TE>   For Simon, a first-time candidate who has marketed himself
primarily as a successful businessman, the stakes are enormous. He
was executive director of William E. Simon &amp; Sons in 1998 when the
firm invested in Pacific Coin. Court records show that he
participated in every stage of the partnership.</TE>
<TE>   On his personal income tax returns, Simon has declared more than
$1.2 million in losses from the Pacific Coin investment.</TE>
<TE>   Hindelang, Pacific Coin's founder, is a convicted marijuana
smuggler who served 30 months in prison during the 1980s. Simon has
said he was unaware of Hindelang's criminal background when his firm
and its partners acquired a controlling stake in Pacific Coin.</TE>
<TE>   The case has been a boon to Democratic incumbent Gray Davis, who
has featured the fraud verdict in a television ad that asks, "Simon:
If his partners can't trust him, how can we trust him with the fifth
largest economy in the world?"</TE>
<TE>   On the stump, Simon has called himself the victim of a "crazy"
verdict by a "runaway jury." The 12 jurors were unanimous in finding
the Simon firm liable for fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's lawyers argued in court Tuesday that the misconduct in
the case was by Hindelang. Namely, they said, he failed to disclose
his criminal record to the Simon group. If he had, the Simon group
would not have invested millions to take control of Pacific Coin,
they said. Hindelang retained a minority interest in Pacific Coin
after the Simon group took over.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of his lies and fraudulent concealment, he caused my
clients to part with millions of dollars," Brian said.</TE>
<TE>   Hindelang's lawyers said the Simon group never asked if he had a
criminal record. After 14 years as Pacific Coin's chief executive, he
had no obligation to volunteer the information, they said.</TE>
<TE>   They also argued that the company's collapse had nothing to do
with Hindelang's criminal history.</TE>
<TE>   The essence of the fraud found by the jury is that the Simon group
hid from Hindelang its plan to borrow huge sums of money to expand
Pacific Coin--against his wishes--and then to take it public quickly
in a stock offering.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon firm's lawyers assert that Hindelang knew of their plan
all along. "Everybody knew that the long-term strategy of this
company was to go public," Brian said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Pacific Coin was unable to repay what it borrowed to
finance the expansion, so its lenders seized the company.</TE>
<TE>   The stock offering, which never took place, would have generated
the money to pay off the debt, along with a windfall for the Simon
group, Hindelang and other investors in Pacific Coin.</TE>
<TE>   "Sticking the public with that debt is another issue," Duffy said.
"But that's the way these people operate."</TE>

<HD>Tattoo Artist Faces Sex Crimes Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County judge ordered a tattoo artist Tuesday to stand
trial on charges that he sexually assaulted three young women at his
North Hollywood business.</LD>
<LD>   The women, ages 16 to 25, testified that Daniel Victor Rivas, 46,
touched them sexually while tattooing their lower backs during the
last two years.</LD>
<LD>   An 18-year-old said she still has an unfinished fairy tattoo
because she left hastily after Rivas touched her in May 2000.</LD>
<TE>   A 25-year-old woman said she never returned to the tattoo parlor
to pick up the $20 that she is owed in change for an $80 tattoo she
got in the summer of 2000 because she didn't want to see Rivas.</TE>
<TE>   After the preliminary hearing, Superior Court Judge Jessica Perrin
Silvers ordered Rivas to stand trial on three felony counts of
penetration with a foreign object and two misdemeanor counts each of
sexual battery and tattooing girls younger than 18.</TE>
<TE>   Rivas has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew Bassis said Rivas could be sentenced to
up to 13 years in state prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Bassis said two victims, including the 25-year-old, contacted
police in May after learning about Rivas' arrest through the media.</TE>
<TE>   Each woman went to Dr. John's Tattoos with friends, but was alone
with Rivas in the back room where they said the assaults took place.</TE>
<TE>   The two younger women testified that Rivas would not permit anyone
to accompany them.</TE>
<TE>   The 16-year-old said in court Tuesday that Rivas undressed her
below the waist before he tattooed a heart on her lower back.</TE>
<TE>   She testified that Rivas touched her after he sprayed alcohol on
her new tattoo, saying he wanted to clean her.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised. I was shocked," she testified Tuesday. "I told
him to stop and give me my clothes."</TE>
<TE>   The girl said she got dressed and left with her two older sisters.</TE>
<TE>   When she got home, she told her parents about the incident and
they notified police.</TE>

<HD>Seniors to Plant Tree as Tribute to the Big Apple</HD>
<DH>Camarillo: Native New Yorkers at retirement community
didn't intend their gatherings to be bittersweet, but attacks changed
things.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compared to some of the memorials planned for the anniversary of the
terrorist attacks in New York and at the Pentagon, today's ceremony
at Leisure Village will be a small affair.</LD>
<LD>   There won't be a solemn reading of names of those who died on that
horrible day a year ago. No heads of state will be in attendance. A
pack of battle-ready F/A-18s won't buzz by in honor formation
overhead.</LD>
<LD>   But Milt Eisner, 82, will be there. So will Ben Perry, 84,
Eisner's close friend and fellow native New Yorker. So will dozens of
other Big Apple transplants and their friends, now living among the
quiet, tree-lined streets of the Camarillo retirement community.</LD>
<TE>   At 11 a.m., members of the New York Club will push shovels into a
patch of grass behind the village's tennis courts and plant an oak
tree to honor those killed a year ago and to pay tribute to the city
they will always call home.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope our children and grandchildren always remember what has
happened," said Perry, who came up with the idea to plant the tree.
"In the future, people will look at this tree and say, 'Yes, I
remember 9/11.' "</TE>
<TE>   For anyone from New York--regardless of where they were living 12
months ago--the terrorist attacks will be impossible to forget, say
members of the club.</TE>
<TE>   "I will always be a New Yorker," said Lynn Lazarus, 77, who grew
up in Manhattan. "But I'm glad I don't have grandchildren. This is
not a world I would want them to grow up in."</TE>
<TE>   Such serious talk was not intended by Eisner and a couple dozen
other Leisure Village residents when they started the club two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   It was understood, said Lazarus and other club members, that talk
of politics, religion and other weighty issues would be left at home.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the club was supposed to be a way for transplanted New
Yorkers who retired and moved to the West to make new friends, play
cards and share the memories of life growing up in the five boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   "These were our formative years" when we lived in the Big Apple,
Eisner said. "Our way of life is from New York, and it leaves a hell
of an impression."</TE>
<TE>   Some club members soon discovered they went to the same grade
school, and in more than one case, had the same teacher. At their
monthly meetings, they would share stories of subway rides, stickball
games and who sold the best chocolate egg cream.</TE>
<TE>   Even a romance was kindled. After Eisner's wife and Lazarus'
husband died, the two fell in love and now live together in the
village.</TE>
<TE>   Then the terrorists attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the retirement village "who didn't know New York from
a hole in the wall" joined the club, said Fran Greenwald-Frank, a
native of Brooklyn who moved with her family to California in 1979.
Others started asking about membership, wondering whether they could
join even if they had never set foot in New York.</TE>
<TE>   One club member's son, a firefighter with the Los Angeles Fire
Department, gave a slide presentation after he returned from working
at ground zero in Lower Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Club members walked door to door at the village with a fire boot
collecting cash donations for the victims' families. They even made a
patriotic-themed red, white and blue T-shirt with "The New York Club"
written over a picture of the Statue of Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   Membership swelled from less than 100 to more than 250 as sympathy
grew for those from New York. Officials at the village said it has
gone from being one of the smaller clubs at the huge complex to one
of the biggest.</TE>
<TE>   "As a group, we felt we needed to do something," said Posner, who
moved from New York to Camarillo in 2000. "It was not only for New
York. If something happened here, we would want to help."</TE>

everybody for the next three years."</TE>

<HD>Woman Hit by Truck Dies</HD>
<DH>Fatality: Suspected drunk driver arrested after accident
outside Burbank radio station, where a crowd had gathered to see pop
star Justin Timberlake.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 21-year-old woman died after being struck by a pickup truck driven
by a suspected drunk driver outside a Burbank radio station where pop
star Justin Timberlake was being interviewed, police said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Anne White of Burbank suffered "horrific injuries"
when she was struck and then dragged for a block about 10:15 p.m.
Monday. She was later pronounced dead at Providence St. Josephs
Hospital, Burbank Police Lt. Tim Stehr said.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested Cameron Duty, 23, of Sylmar on suspicion of
murder, driving under the influence and hit-and-run.</LD>
<TE>   Duty, who is being held in lieu of $1-million bail, is scheduled
to be arraigned today in Burbank Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Fans had gathered behind the KIIS-FM (102.7) studios at Warner
Boulevard and Avon Street shortly after 10 p.m. to catch a glimpse of
Timberlake, who was there taping an interview, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police investigators that Duty was
boisterous--playing loud music from his truck's stereo--and that he
appeared intoxicated, Stehr said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Duty jumped into his truck and drove in reverse at a
high rate of speed across Warner Boulevard and over the curb.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit a stop sign and hit the victim and continued in reverse
approximately 50 feet up Avon Street," Stehr said. "He then struck a
parked vehicle, put the truck in drive and started forward with the
victim still under the vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   Police said two Burbank officers on patrol near Olive and Lima
avenues noticed a white pickup with extensive damage and stopped to
investigate a possible traffic accident.</TE>
<TE>   Duty was detained and failed a field sobriety test, Stehr said.</TE>
<TE>   Timberlake, 21, a singer-songwriter with the group 'N Sync,
released a statement expressing sympathy to White's family and
friends.</TE>
<TE>   He also said his representatives were in contact with RADD,
Recording Artists, Actors &amp; Athletes Against Drunk Driving, and would
announce a partnership with the organization to raise awareness about
the danger of driving drunk.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Laughlin, the radio station's general manager, said the
incident was tragic.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in Los Angeles has stopped at one time and said,
'There's a celebrity,' " Laughlin said. "All of a sudden, this young
lady met with an unfortunate tragedy doing just that."</TE>

<HD>Tiger's Site: Supervisors Hope to Swing It</HD>
<DH>Golf: County board agrees to negotiate with Woods' group,
which wants to build a center for kids.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County supervisors on Tuesday agreed to open negotiations with
the Tiger Woods Foundation over possible construction of an
educational center and youth golf facility in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   The golfer's foundation wants to build a $25-million center
somewhere in Southern California where children would take computer
classes, receive tutoring and learn the finer points of golf.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County hopes to attract the facility by allowing the
foundation to lease county land at the driving range at H.G. Dad
Miller Golf Course at $1 a year for 50 years.</LD>
<TE>   The foundation has been in talks with other communities, including
Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The center is meant to expose underprivileged children to a game
often associated with wealth and exclusivity.</TE>
<TE>   Earl Woods, Tiger's father, told supervisors he has long
encouraged the golfer to give back to the community.</TE>
<TE>   "We prepared him for the success he's enjoying now," Earl Woods
said. "Part of that was sharing the success."</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods attended Western High School in Anaheim and frequently
played at Dad Miller course in the mid-1990s. Even then, "He realized
there were some people who didn't have the opportunity he had," his
father said.</TE>
<TE>   Earl Woods, the foundation's president, said that when he asked
his son for funds to start the foundation, Tiger Woods wrote a check
for $500,000. Since then, Tiger Woods has donated $1.5 million in PGA
Tour winnings to set up the foundation.</TE>

<HD>Ira Yellin, 62; Civic Leader and Longtime Champion of the
City's Historic Core</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ira Yellin, a civic leader and longtime champion of downtown Los
Angeles perhaps best known for his restoration of Grand Central
Market, died Tuesday. He was 62.</LD>
<LD>   Yellin, who had battled lung cancer since last September, died of
complications of the disease at his home in Santa Monica Canyon. His
wife, Adele, was at his side.</LD>
<LD>   Aside from Grand Central, Yellin and a group of investors bought
and restored downtown's landmark Bradbury Building, the Million
Dollar Theater and the old Metropolitan Water District headquarters,
among others. He also led the restoration of the historic train
terminal Union Station.</LD>
<TE>   A small man who balanced a seemingly endless reserve of energy
with a warm, engaging manner, Yellin spent much of his life bucking
trends and engaging in a sometimes unconventional stream of new
challenges.</TE>
<TE>   The son of an orthodox rabbi, Yellin graduated from Harvard Law
School only to join the Marine Corps. He later left a successful
career developing offices and shopping malls to try to revive the
tattered, neglected stitch of buildings and streets that make up
historic downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In the last years of his life, he worked feverishly to sidestep
cancer, refusing to slow down, pushing himself to finish a slew of
real estate developments.</TE>
<TE>   "I seem to always need to prove something can be done that people
seem to think is an impossibility," Yellin said in a recent
interview. "I suppose that's why I'm downtown. For all of its
doubters, I'm determined to prove downtown Los Angeles can be a place
of greatness. It can be wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Highly regarded for his integrity and evenhandedness, Yellin was
admired for such moxie.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles owes Yellin a "debt of gratitude" for his work
downtown, Kevin Starr, the state librarian and an urban observer,
told The Times earlier this year in a profile of Yellin.</TE>
<TE>   He praised Yellin for his constant engagement with the historic
core, the long neglected collection of landmark structures nestled in
the shadow of Bunker Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin is an "urban pioneer ... [a man] unique for what he wants
for the city," Starr said.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin was on a short list of developers who gambled on spending
significantly to upgrade old office buildings and markets downtown in
the 1970s and '80s, a time when most of the city's commercial
developers focused on near foolproof bets: creating skyscrapers on
adjoining Bunker Hill.</TE>
<TE>   The developer said he chose historic downtown because he had a
"love affair" with the place, particularly so with Grand Central, a
block-long menagerie of food and curio stalls open since World War I.</TE>
<TE>   To him, the market--nestled next to a large complex of apartments
restored by Yellin--embodied what Los Angeles could be: a locale
brimming with the region's diverse humanity, a place where Spanish
and English and Asian languages mingled in the air with the smoky
residue of papusas and fried rice and roast chicken.</TE>
<TE>   Striding through the market a few months ago, Yellin remarked of
Grand Central: "I'm always totally energized here. It just feels and
smells and is utterly special."</TE>
<TE>   The market complex also proved somewhat controversial. Yellin and
his partners were able to complete the rehabilitation only with the
help of a $44-million bond package backed by the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment
Agency.</TE>
<TE>   When Grand Central didn't generate the revenue Yellin thought it
would--largely a result of downtown's inability to fully recover from
the early 1990s recession--some criticized the two public agencies
for spending large sums of taxpayer money to aid a private developer.</TE>
<TE>   Others said the market's worth could not be measured in terms of
the financial bottom line, that Grand Central was a catalyst sparking
more building.</TE>
<TE>   "If Ira didn't show the beauty that could be uncovered, the
activity that we are seeing in that area, it wouldn't have happened,"
former Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Feuer said in the recent
Times profile of Yellin.</TE>
<TE>   Feuer was referring to a raft of fresh construction in
neighborhoods near the market, including the Walt Disney Concert Hall
and a $171-million Caltrans regional headquarters developed by
Yellin's firm, Urban Partners.</TE>
<TE>   Ever optimistic, Yellin insisted that pouring public money into
the market had been a smart move, one that eventually would help
historic downtown become the sort of proud, inspiring "place of
unbridled energy" it was when he was a child.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin was born near Boston in 1940, but raised in Los Angeles. As
a boy, he was a frequent visitor to downtown with his father, a noted
Talmudic scholar with a fondness for urban life and an insistence
that his children follow the Jewish notion of tikkun olam, or
repairing the world through good works.</TE>
<TE>   Pushed by his family to focus on scholarly achievement, Yellin
left to study at Princeton University and Harvard Law School, then at
UC Berkeley, where he earned a master's degree in law.</TE>
<TE>   After wrapping up his education, Yellin in 1966 surprised many by
joining the Marines--doing so, he said, to prove the ideas he held
about public service weren't just talk, and that a small man, a
Jewish man, could bear up to the toughness of military life. He spent
just over a year in the Marines before receiving his honorable
discharge and returning to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   From 1967 to 1975, Yellin worked as a lawyer at a Beverly Hills
firm, all the while devoting considerable time to helping run a
nonprofit legal advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Restless and seeking a new challenge, he joined a prominent real
estate development and management company, where he oversaw
developments throughout the state and on Los Angeles' Westside.</TE>
<TE>   But the world of big, glossy buildings located far from downtown,
many of them the sort of office structures known more for their
coolly efficient design than for pulling the heart strings, never
completely stirred Yellin.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, he said, "I decided to follow where my heart was." He
began his own real estate firm, Yellin Co., focusing on downtown and
other dense areas of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin spent the rest of his working life consumed mostly by
projects that revolved around restoration and revival of once grand
architectural works and neighborhoods, some of them outside of
downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He helped create a downtown development blueprint for City Hall.
He briefly joined the powerful real estate firm Catellus Development
Corp., serving as vice president from 1996 to 1999, when he directed
the restoration of Union Station. He served as the architectural
consultant for downtown's massive new Roman Catholic Cathedral of Our
Lady of Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, Yellin never let his working life slow down his
other pursuits, particularly those connected to the city's cultural
and political life.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin was a friend and advisor to powerful city and national
political leaders. His home was the site of frequent Democratic
fund-raisers and social events benefiting liberal causes.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin, who considered himself a "frustrated artist and
architect," served on the boards of some of the city's premier
cultural institutions, including the Skirball Cultural Center and the
J. Paul Getty Trust, which oversees the Getty Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin also was a past president of the American Jewish Committee,
which promotes religious tolerance and understanding, and a board
member of several other civic groups.</TE>
<TE>   "His love of the city and the way he has worked to make things
better here, that's what I think of when I think of Ira Yellin," said
longtime friend Ron Rogers, commenting on Yellin's civic involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin's friends were never more inspired than by his battle to
beat lung cancer. Struck by the disease even though he never smoked,
hardly drank and worked out with fervor, Yellin never indulged in
self-pity and refused to be slowed.</TE>
<TE>   Until the last weeks of his life, he continued to work as much as
he could, shepherding projects at Urban Partners.</TE>
<TE>   "He set a standard of uncompromised quality," said Dan Rosenfeld,
a principal in the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenfeld said that when Yellin finally stopped coming to the
office, he worked from home, teleconferencing into a meeting with his
partners just last Friday, eager and optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Yellin is survived by a daughter,
Jessica, and a son, Seth, both of New York City; his mother, Dorothy
of Beverly Hills; and two brothers, Dr. Albert Yellin of Los Angeles
and Dr. Marc Yellin of Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be at 10:30 a.m. Thursday at Mt. Sinai Memorial Park
in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin's family has asked that, in lieu of flowers, memorial
donations be made to the Westside Children's Center, American Jewish
Committee or Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center's Palliative Care
Program.</TE>

<LD>Thousands more sky marshals are flying. Most airport workers have
been given criminal background checks. Intelligence sharing is
better. At Los Angeles International Airport, 49 lanes are open for
screening passengers, up from 42 before the Sept. 11 attacks, with a
goal of at least 60.</LD>
<LD>   Yet today's air travel system is still riddled with holes. As of
midsummer, federal agents were still sneaking guns and fake bombs
past airport screeners on about 25% of the tries.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the sight of grandmothers having their knitting
needles confiscated annoys travelers, including some in important
positions. While experts insist random testing is vital, Rep. John L.
Mica (R-Fla.), chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, grumps,
"Our passenger profiling is politically correct but also dumb."</LD>
<TE>   Most planned longer-term reforms are troubled. The plan to test
every checked bag for explosives means installing hundreds more
testing machines that are expensive, not fully reliable and don't
exist in sufficient numbers. Congress may have to stretch its Dec. 31
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Help is a year or more away: A second generation of the
computer-assisted passenger pre-screening system could be tested next
year. It will merge passenger information with intelligence reports
and watch lists. Details are classified, but the system might
green-light a business traveler who flies the same routes every
month, never changes reservations and always buys a round-trip ticket
with a corporate credit card. A warning flag might pop up for a
traveler who's moved frequently, visited countries where terrorists
operate, abruptly switched flights and paid cash for a one-way
ticket.</TE>

<HD>For Some, a Time of Quiet Bereavement</HD>
<DH>New York: Many will grieve in private, remembering lost
ones with a day spent at the beach, the park or with kin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Really, it is unavoidable. But some will try today to escape the
intensity of a million pieces of this city coming together to
remember what happened here a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   One widow has rented a room in a New Jersey shore town and asked
the hotel to remove the television and radio. She does not want to
see her grief teased on the evening news. She does not want to
glimpse Fifth Avenue department stores that have removed their window
displays and etched "In Remembrance" or "Never Again" on the glass.
She wants to be with her memories, says a friend. Alone.</LD>
<LD>   Debbie Harrison plans to attend a morning service at her Queens
church, then go to nearby Flushing Meadow Park, where she and Charles
John, her late partner of six years, used to spend lazy weekend
afternoons. John, a security supervisor at the Fiji Bank, died at the
World Trade Center.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm going to sit by the water at the park as long as I can stand
it and say some things out loud," Harrison said.</TE>
<TE>   She is consciously avoiding ceremonies at ground zero: "No, never,
never, never. It's too much. I don't like anybody telling me how to
grieve."</TE>
<TE>   Many victims' families declined offers from the president and the
mayor to participate in ground zero's somber pageantry. Nobody kept
track of how many or why these widows and mothers and fathers did not
want to commiserate, read names of the dead or lay a rose at the
site.</TE>
<TE>   As one who said yes to being there when President Bush arrives
today, Michael Cartier, whose 26-year-old brother, James, died, fully
understands why many might say no.</TE>
<TE>   "People are still just waking up and starting now to grieve and
couldn't possibly make it downtown," said Cartier, who added that his
parents are "paralyzed still, still unable to cope." His father, a
Korean War veteran, has never visited ground zero. His mother went
once.</TE>
<TE>   Today, both parents will go to Mass in the morning and to James'
grave in the afternoon, where they'll release a white dove. Then, the
six Cartier children will gather at their parents' home "to be
together with our memories of James," said Michael, who is the
youngest sibling.</TE>
<TE>   But it's difficult to avoid the anniversary altogether because
there is so much to remind New York of what was. There is the sky
this week, a cloudless blue--the way it was that whole horrible day.
And the rhythms of a city coming to life in September after an August
vacation.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the media coverage of the anniversary, coverage that
comes now around the clock. And the fact that almost every
institution in this city, from churches and schools and temples to
hair salons and delis and banks, is making some sort of Sept. 11
statement.</TE>
<TE>   A thrift shop on Manhattan's Columbus Avenue has scribbled
"Everyday Heroes" on its windows; a Brooklyn beauty salon has erected
a shrine in its front lobby displaying police and fire T-shirts; and
a small consulting firm is closed today, leaving a voice message
explaining to its clients around the nation that "all New Yorkers are
in mourning today. We'll be open Thursday."</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it would be unseemly not to close," said Mark Penski,
a business consultant, who is at a loss about what he will do rather
than work. "I can't go to a mall, but I can't turn on the TV either."</TE>
<TE>   News executives acknowledge that coverage of the anniversary is
inescapable--and perhaps overdone. In fact, every New York City
newspaper's front page on Tuesday was entirely about Sept. 11 or its
aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   ABC "World News Tonight" anchor Peter Jennings said in his Monday
e-mail to viewers, "We do hear from some of you that it's all too
much, and there are moments when we all must feel that we are being
overwhelmed. But in this newsroom, we hope that when the day is done
on Wednesday, we will look back believing that our journey through
history and memory will have meant something to everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Even some journalists can't stomach the coverage, although it
might be unprofessional to admit it. A CNN correspondent who has been
covering the story said she does not plan to turn on her television
today--unless she must.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing I need to see is images already burned into the
brain. I don't need to have them underlined, made more vivid," said
the correspondent, who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Grieving experts say that "too much," of course, is a relative
term. Some survivors and victims' families will watch it all, attend
every church and civic ceremony, read each name of the 2,819 World
Trade Center dead as they are listed this week in newspapers or
scrolled on television screens. But others, like the widow at the
Jersey Shore and Debbie Harrison, couldn't possibly immerse
themselves that way. Watching the replays of the commandeered
airliners ramming into the towers is like seeing their loved ones
die, over and over again.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't watch that, not today, not tomorrow especially," Harrison
explained. That said, she is unsure how alone she wants to be on the
anniversary: "I have lots of people, friends, standing by waiting for
a phone call. I don't know if I want to be alone or with people, if I
want to know about the ceremonies or not. I have no idea what I want
to do."</TE>
<TE>   "An anniversary is a big stage in grieving, and one way to meet it
is to retreat," said Msgr. Michael Connelly, who, if he wasn't an
expert on loss after 20 years of tending his parishioners in the
Rockaways, has become one in the last 12 months. His community lost
75 people in the World Trade Center attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the widows here decided not to have her children come to
our Mass, that they were better off in school," Connelly said. She
wanted a "normal" day for them, if possible, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the people Connelly has observed having the most difficult
time with the anniversary, surprisingly enough, are not the ones who
lost family but those who lost jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked to a lot of young people who are still out of work
because of 9/11 and are almost bitter because there is so much
celebration this week," Connelly said sympathetically.</TE>
<TE>   But celebration is an odd word, said Bart Helms, an office worker
who walked down 22 flights of a tower to safety before it fell. He is
going water skiing with his girlfriend today on a lake in upstate New
York. They are going to swim and picnic and maybe play miniature
golf.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't run away from this day and say I'm not going to feel
something," he said. "But I can celebrate with a willful act of
enjoying life. That's my way of remembering."</TE>

<LD>"Bioterrorism does not respect geographic boundaries," says Mary
Selecky, secretary of the Washington state Department of Health. "We
are either all protected, or we are all at risk."</LD>
<LD>   Then we are all still at risk.</LD>
<LD>   Preparing for biochemical attacks nationwide means building a
whole new defensive network, the equivalent to creating all of
today's police and fire departments and some emergency rooms. The
U.S. is fractionally better off than a year ago, but no more.</LD>
<TE>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now runs an
interactive computer network linking it with about 2,000 local health
agencies and medical associations. The network is geared to help spot
and respond to outbreaks of disease quickly.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of last fall's anthrax attacks, mail addressed to
federal offices is irradiated. For the rest, the Postal Service is
testing equipment capable of detecting and neutralizing a wide range
of biochemical toxins. It could be operating systemwide in just over
a year if all goes well.</TE>
<TE>   Smallpox is another source of worry. Its fatality rate is 30% for
those who aren't vaccinated. After a crash effort over the last year,
the government has doubled its supply of vaccine to 110 million doses
and is aiming for 250 million doses by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   But that would still be 38 million short of the national
population. Officials are still pondering not only who would
administer the vaccine but also who would receive it.</TE>
<TE>   When they do decide about smallpox, they will still have to worry
about the likes of botulism, plague, tularemia and Ebola, chemical
agents such as sarin and mustard gas and radioactive waste--not to
mention anthrax.</TE>

<HD>Blood Shortage Seen for National Disaster</HD>
<DH>Health: Red Cross, other suppliers urge Congress to help
build up reserves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDDY RAMIREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's hospitals do not have sufficient blood reserves to
respond to a major national disaster, representatives of the
country's largest blood suppliers warned Tuesday. As federal security
officials issued high-level warnings about potential terrorist
attacks today, the American Red Cross and independent blood banks
urged members of the House subcommittee on oversight and
investigations to support a federally funded campaign aimed at
restoring the national supply.</LD>
<LD>   "Today, there is less than a three-day supply nationwide. Never in
modern history have our reserves been lower," said Jeanne Dariotis,
president of America's Blood Centers, a network of 75 blood
facilities that collects about half of the nation's blood supply. "In
these days of heightened concerns for attacks, our blood supply is
inadequate to deal with a major disaster."</LD>
<LD>   The blood shortage is expected to worsen because of public
concerns over what officials called the "theoretical" possibility
that the West Nile virus can be contracted through blood
transfusions. Additionally, officials worry that new regulations
prohibiting blood donations from anyone who has lived in Europe for
more than five years will further discourage would-be donors.</LD>
<TE>   Top officials from other blood suppliers in the nation, including
the president of the New York Blood Center, agreed that the number of
donors will continue to dwindle unless the government takes action.
However, their conclusion that blood is now in short supply
contradicts the findings of a General Accounting Office report
presented at Tuesday's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional auditors found that the national blood supply has
"generally remained adequate" since Sept. 11, when millions of
Americans rushed to blood centers and stood in long lines to give
blood.</TE>
<TE>   But because no national system is in place to track the nation's
blood supply and federal agencies cannot determine adequate amounts
except for recommendations in times of crisis, conflicting opinions
often arise on exactly when a national blood shortage hits.</TE>
<TE>   GAO Director Janet Heinrich pointed to the weeks immediately after
Sept. 11 to highlight the rift that exists between the nation's blood
community and the government on a safe national blood supply.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 600,000 additional blood units were collected in the weeks
after the attacks, according to the GAO report, but fewer than 260
units were used to treat the victims. As a result, slightly more than
200,000 units of collected blood expired and had to be thrown away,
about five times the amount usually discarded. The amount of blood
wasted did not include how much blood hospitals had to throw away
once they received the shipments from suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   Donated red blood cells last 42 days and platelets are good for
only five days.</TE>
<TE>   "Because very few of the units donated immediately after Sept. 11
were needed by survivors, this experience has raised concerns among
blood suppliers and within the government about how best to manage
and prepare the blood supply for emergencies," Heinrich said.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Health and Human Services and blood suppliers
agreed to work more closely to avoid collecting more blood than
needed in the event of another national disaster.</TE>
<TE>   In December, an HHS task force that includes the Red Cross and
other independent blood banks formed to develop standards on a
national blood supply tracking system and how to keep enough blood in
supply year round.</TE>

<LD>Border authorities are more alert to terrorism than a year ago. U.S.
agents are checking would-be entrants' names more consistently, and
even Canadian citizens must now present photo identification.
Inspectors are no longer bound by a rule that no traveler could be
delayed more than 45 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Within 15 minutes of the takeoff of a flight heading to the United
States, the names, citizenship and dates of birth of all passengers
and crew must be in the hands of customs officials for checking
against watch lists and other databases.</LD>
<LD>   Before Sept. 11, such notice was voluntary. Among those then
refusing to participate were the national airlines of Pakistan, Saudi
Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Kuwait.</LD>
<TE>   But Washington's ambitious promises to tighten border security are
colliding with budget limits, technical challenges, political
ambivalence and bureaucratic turf battles.</TE>
<TE>   It was only in July--10 months after the terrorist attacks--that
the State Department quit allowing travelers in Saudi Arabia to get
U.S. visas through travel agencies, often without so much as an
interview with an official at the American consulate.</TE>
<TE>   Starting this month, Immigration and Naturalization Service border
inspectors have new authority and discretion to obtain fingerprint
and detailed background information from noncitizens, based on
intelligence information.</TE>
<TE>   What's less clear is whether the border inspectors are getting the
crucial intelligence data they need, when they need it.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, the effectiveness of INS people at the border is
dependent on the effectiveness of the intelligence information that
we receive," says INS spokesman Russ Bergeron.</TE>

<HD>Administration Defends Secret Searches in Terror War</HD>
<DH>Security: They're the best way to fight threat, Justice
Department lawyer tells senators who voice concerns about
constitutional abuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Bush administration lawyer defended the government's new policy of
allowing its law enforcement investigators to press for secret
searches of suspected foreign agents, saying Tuesday that this
coordinated approach is needed in the war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "What is at stake is nothing less than our ability to protect this
country from foreign spies and terrorists," David Kris, an associate
deputy attorney general, told the Senate Judiciary Committee. "We
need all of our best people, intelligence and law enforcement alike,
working together to neutralize the threat."</LD>
<LD>   While coordination sounds unremarkable, the policy of merging law
enforcement and foreign intelligence-gathering has provoked much
dispute in Washington, most of it behind closed doors within the
Justice Department.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Senate Democrats held a public hearing to voice their
concern over what they say is a growing abuse of the law by Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said the expanded search policy
raises the specter of a return of secret buggings and break-ins by
the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to improve coordination between the criminal
prosecutors and intelligence officers, but we did not intend to
obliterate the distinction between the two, and we did not do so,"
said Leahy, the committee's chairman. "This means they could secretly
investigate any Americans and at any time they want."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she shared that concern.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when Congress passed the USA Patriot Act, lawmakers
sought "to lower the bar slightly" for obtaining wiretaps of foreign
suspects, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "In my view, there has been a skewing of what we set up,"
Feinstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Kris disagreed and said the recent changes in the search policy
were likely to be "quite modest" in their effect.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute centers on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,
or FISA, a Cold War-era law that some say has become outdated in the
war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Congress passed the measure in 1978 for two purposes.</TE>
<TE>   First, it was intended to allow the government to search and
wiretap Soviet spies or other foreign agents operating in the United
States. This process had to be kept secret; on occasion, suspected
spies were employees of the FBI or the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   Second, lawmakers sought to prevent the government from using
national security as a guise for spying on Americans. In the
mid-1970s, it was revealed that the Nixon administration and the FBI
had spied on thousands of Vietnam War protesters and civil rights
activists, claiming that they were threats to national security.</TE>
<TE>   The law created a seven-judge court within the Justice Department.
The court, composed of U.S. district court judges, is charged with
reviewing requests for national security wiretaps or searches.</TE>
<TE>   If the FBI had evidence that a person was an "agent of a foreign
power" or a member of "a group engaged in international terrorism,"
it could obtain authority to wiretap that person for "the purpose ...
of obtaining foreign intelligence information."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the evidence could be used to prosecute the individual;
for example, suspected spies could be charged with espionage.</TE>
<TE>   But at the start, the purpose of the search was to gather
intelligence, not to build a criminal case.</TE>
<TE>   The Constitution sets a high barrier before the government can
undertake a search in criminal cases. The 4th Amendment says the
government must have "probable cause" of criminal wrongdoing before a
judge can issue a search warrant. This constitutional rule protects
the privacy of Americans from official searches and seizures.</TE>
<TE>   But this strict privacy standard does not apply in FISA cases. If
the FBI can show that a person is linked to a "foreign power" or
terrorist group, its agents can wiretap him, even if they have no
evidence of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians have feared that if the FBI can expand its use
of FISA, agents could do an end run around the 4th Amendment and
subject innocent people to bugging and spying.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the FISA court expressed similar concerns in a ruling that
rebuked Ashcroft for having gone too far in merging domestic
crime-fighting with foreign intelligence-gathering.</TE>
<TE>   The judges said they needed to maintain the "wall" between the
two.</TE>
<TE>   "This Court is the arbiter of FISA's terms and requirements," they
said in the May 17 opinion. Ashcroft's new policy "allows FISA to be
used primarily for a law enforcement purpose," and it would
"authorize criminal prosecutors to advise FBI intelligence officials
on the initiation of FISA's intrusive seizures," they said.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials disagreed. They said the Sept. 11 attacks
showed the need for all agents to work together. If criminal
investigators learn a foreign suspect is involved in suspicious
activities, they can urge the intelligence unit to seek a FISA
warrant.</TE>
<TE>   The USA Patriot Act expressly "authorizes more effective
coordination between intelligence and law-enforcement officials," the
department said in its appeal to a special three-member review court
appointed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, that court met behind closed doors at the Justice
Department to hear Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson present this
argument.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's hearing, Kris said the critics were exaggerating the
effect of the change.</TE>
<TE>   "As always, a FISA target must be an agent of a foreign power," he
said. "Domestic criminals--corrupt Enron executives, Sammy 'the Bull'
Gravano or Timothy McVeigh--cannot be FISA targets.... Let me
emphasize: We cannot monitor anyone today whom we could not have
monitored at this time last year."</TE>
<TE>   The senators admitted to struggling to understand FISA and to find
the right balance between searches and civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a dramatic change in the terrorist landscape since
1978, when FISA was enacted," said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah),
adding that he supported the administration.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Jon Kyl of Arizona and Democrat Charles E. Schumer of
New York have sponsored a bill to allow FISA searches of a "lone
wolf" terrorist who is not affiliated with a known terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the committee heard from Coleen Rowley, a Minneapolis FBI
agent who said that her office was unable to obtain a FISA warrant to
inspect the laptop computer of Zacarias Moussaoui in the weeks before
the Sept. 11 attack because there was no clear evidence linking the
French Muslim to an international terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to give the government some expanded powers," Schumer
said. "The real trick is finding the right balance."</TE>
<TE>   Leahy said he might offer legislation to change or clarify FISA,
but he would probably await a ruling from the review court.</TE>

<LD>The nation's trucks and railroads, threading their way across bridges
and through tunnels into every neighborhood in the land, offer almost
limitless possibilities for terrorist attacks. The pipelines,
chemical plants and fuel storage yards dotting the landscape offer
additional targets.</LD>
<LD>   Only the barest beginning has been made to safeguard this.</LD>
<LD>   Amtrak now requires passengers to show photo IDs when they buy
tickets; those using credit cards in ticket machines have their names
checked against FBI databases.</LD>
<TE>   Boarding passengers are not screened, however. There's no
systematic check for explosives. And it's impossible to be sure a
passenger who lugs a heavy bag onto a train even stays aboard.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is a little brighter for rail freight. The Assn. of
American Railroads, which represents freight lines and Amtrak, has
created a 24/7 center to monitor security. The railroads have also
increased tracking of hazardous materials and munition shipments and
compared the list of their employees against the FBI watch list.</TE>
<TE>   Both physical and computer security have been bolstered, as they
have for the nation's 2.2 million miles of privately operated natural
gas and petroleum pipelines. One pipeline company moved its control
facility from an office building with a public underground garage to
a location in the woods.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the intractable problem posed by the estimated 7.8
million commercial trucks and 500,000-plus interstate trucking
companies, nearly 39,000 of which ship hazardous materials. The
government is trying to lay the groundwork for "safe shipper" systems
that would rely on companies to screen workers and guard cargoes.</TE>

<LD>"Today, the year 2002, I have more spies stealing more secrets than
at any time in the history of the CIA," Jim Pavitt, head of the
agency's clandestine service, told an audience in April.</LD>
<LD>   Pavitt's comment reflects the fact that, while blamed for not
preventing Sept. 11, the intelligence community has been lavished
with additional resources to stop attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The CIA's budget swelled by more than $1 billion, the FBI's by
$745 million. The National Security Agency, the secret eyes and ears
of the world, also got a hefty increase.</LD>
<TE>   One result: June's graduating class at "The Farm," the CIA's boot
camp in Virginia, exceeded 100 officers, the largest since the
Vietnam War. The CIA's anti-terrorism center has tripled to about
1,200 people. The CIA has three times more Arabic speakers than it
did three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is also rebuilding in some areas that lost up to 25% of
their staff members during the early-to mid-1990s, a time when the
collapse of the Soviet Union led some to argue that intelligence
agencies were no longer needed.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the FBI is adding analysts, linguists and computer
specialists.</TE>
<TE>   Funds are likewise pouring into development of technologies,
including sensors that might find and track chemical weapons and
small-scale nuclear devices.</TE>
<TE>   But most new hires are of European descent, not from the regions
where terrorist threats originate. And many skeptics doubt that even
Sept. 11 will force the agencies to share information, so long and
deep is their history of not cooperating. A Senate aide puts it this
way: "I think they tend to believe they're being very
cooperative--until something happens."</TE>

<HD>Daughter of Jeb Bush Accused of Drug Relapse</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Gov. Jeb Bush's 25-year-old daughter was found with what was believed
to be crack cocaine at a drug rehabilitation center where she was
undergoing court-ordered treatment, police said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   If confirmed, it would be Noelle Bush's second lapse since
entering rehabilitation and could result in jail.</LD>
<LD>   Police were called to the Center for Drug Free Living in Orlando,
where workers gave them a 0.2-gram rock that they said they found in
Noelle Bush's shoe, Sgt. Orlando Rolon said.</LD>
<TE>   The rock tested positive for cocaine in a police field test, but
Bush was not immediately arrested because police could not get staff
members at the rehab center to cooperate and give sworn statements,
Rolon said.</TE>
<TE>   A patient had called police, but staffers tried to persuade them
to let the center follow its standard policy of handling the matter
internally, Rolon said.</TE>
<TE>   The center's president and chief executive, Jerry Feulner,
declined to comment Tuesday, citing privacy concerns.</TE>
<TE>   After a meeting in Orlando, the governor said his daughter must
"resolve in her heart and mind that she needs to change."</TE>
<TE>   "She needs to accept responsibility. She knows that we love her.
She knows a whole lot of people care for her, but it is up to her,"
he said. Her lawyer, Dean Cannon, did not return calls seeking
comment.</TE>
<TE>   She was arrested in January at a pharmacy drive-through window for
allegedly trying to buy the anti-anxiety drug Xanax with a fraudulent
prescription. She was admitted to the treatment center a month later,
with the possibility that charges would be dropped if she completed
the program.</TE>
<TE>   In July, she was found with prescription drugs that had been taken
from a cabinet at the rehab center. She spent three days in jail
before being allowed to return to rehab.</TE>

<LD>If there is one bright spot in the anti-terrorism picture, it may be
nuclear power.</LD>
<LD>   Preliminary results from new studies suggest that if a Boeing 757
airliner crashed into a reactor building, it would not penetrate the
4-foot-thick concrete walls and the grid of 2-inch-thick steel
reinforcing bars, according to Steve Floyd of the Nuclear Energy
Institute, an industry group. The still-thicker walls of nuclear
waste storage buildings would also hold up.</LD>
<LD>   Even if terrorists produced a radioactive leak, the damage might
not be great, says Michael Weber of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. "It's not as catastrophic as one might imagine. You have
to have a combination of severe conditions to have significant
off-site consequences."</LD>
<TE>   As for ground attacks, critics argue that requirements for guards
are still inadequate. Few have the training, heavy weapons or numbers
needed to repel a commando assault, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials insist many plants are much better defended.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst case for us would be a highly trained terrorist
organization with multiple team members and sophisticated weapons and
detailed plans of our sites," says Mark Findlay, security director of
Nuclear Management Co., which has six plants in the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   To meet such assaults, some plants are installing more electronic
sensors and expanding their defensive perimeters. Huge rocks and
concrete Jersey barriers can deter vehicle attacks. Guards, many now
armed with automatic weapons, patrol the no-man's land between the
old and new lines.</TE>
<TE>   "It very much looks like a fort or a military base now," Findlay
says of one of his plants.</TE>

<LD>The doughty Coast Guard is patrolling the ports at near-World War II
levels. Cutters escort cruise ships and high-risk vessels. "Sea
marshals" ride shotgun for harbor pilots.</LD>
<LD>   The Customs Service has bought about 4,000 radiation detection
wands. For the first time, a handful of customs agents are stationed
abroad to spot suspicious ships and cargoes.</LD>
<LD>   At the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, divers randomly inspect
ship hulls, tankers travel only by daylight and port police give
extra protection to high-risk vessels.</LD>
<TE>   "We take command of the engine room," said Noel Cunningham, chief
of the Port of Los Angeles Police. His officers inspect crews'
credentials and "walk the halls of the ship" looking for trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the U.S. has about 350 deepwater ports, most lined
with chemical plants and other facilities that could multiply the
destructive force of a terrorist bomb. More than 2 billion tons of
cargo, including 156 million tons of hazardous materials, sailed in
and out last year.</TE>
<TE>   A watertight national system for preventing terrorists from
planting a bomb among these 2 billion tons of cargo seems years away
at best.</TE>
<TE>   One question is how to substantially tighten security without
unbearable delays. About 95% of U.S. imports arrive by sea; even
modest slowdowns would damage the economy, as steps taken after Sept.
11 almost did.</TE>
<TE>   "Our adversaries used our open system to wage war on us at home,"
says Stephen E. Flynn, a former Coast Guard official and senior
fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "And we reacted by
blockading our own economy."</TE>

<LD>New security measures at treatment plants, reservoirs and dams

<LD>   Some systems are testing water quality more often and for more

Rick Hahn, a security consultant who developed a five-year,
$132-million plan to protect the Los Angeles water system. Hahn
recognizes the havoc that would result from even a minor attack that
caused the public to lose confidence in water purity.</TE>
<TE>   But if Los Angeles is on a fairly high alert against the threat,
other cities appear less so.</TE>

unprotected banks in Worcester, Mass., before encountering four armed

<TE>   The physical and electronic systems that control water supplies
are also potentially vulnerable. A hacker penetrated the system

<HD>Death Upheld for Crips Founder</HD>
<DH>Court: But appeals panel suggests clemency for the killer
who became a peace prize nominee for his anti-gang work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court Tuesday upheld the death sentence of former
Los Angeles street gang co-founder Stanley "Tookie" Williams for four
1979 murders. But in a rare move, the court suggested that Gov. Gray
Davis consider commuting the sentence because of Williams' "laudable"
anti-gang efforts while in prison, which led to his being nominated
for the Nobel Peace Prize last year.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, 48, one of the two primary founders of the notorious
Crips gang, asserted that his constitutional rights were violated at
a 1981 trial in which he was convicted of the robbery-murders of an
employee at a Whittier 7-Eleven and the owner of a South Los Angeles
motel, the owner's wife and the man's daughter.</LD>
<LD>   Williams contended that jurors had been prejudiced against him
because of excessive courtroom security during the trial, allegedly
coerced testimony from a witness beaten by the police and
unconstitutionally deficient representation by his trial
lawyer--particularly in the penalty phase of his trial.</LD>
<TE>   But a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
unanimously rejected all those claims. "Williams is not entitled to
relief from his conviction or sentence in the federal courts,"
Circuit Judge Procter Hug Jr. wrote in the conclusion of his 96-page
opinion.</TE>
<TE>   However, he pointedly noted that "federal courts are not the only
forum for relief, and that Williams may file a petition for clemency
with the governor of California," citing the section of the
California Constitution that gives the governor unbridled power to
grant executive clemency.</TE>
<TE>   "We are aware," Hug continued, "of Williams' 2001 Nobel Peace
Prize nomination for his laudable efforts opposing gang violence from
his prison cell, notably his line of children's books, subtitled
'Tookie Speaks Out Against Gang Violence,' and his creation of the
Internet Project for Street Peace.</TE>
<TE>   "Although Williams' good works and accomplishments since
incarceration make him a worthy candidate for the exercise of
gubernatorial discretion, they are not matters that we in the federal
judiciary are at liberty to take into consideration in our review of
Williams' habeas corpus petition," Hug concluded before affirming the
convictions and sentence, thus paving the way for Williams to be
executed.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the panel's ruling is overturned by a larger group of 9th
Circuit judges or the U.S. Supreme Court, a clemency petition from
Williams is likely to reach Davis' desk sometime next year.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the governor has spurned clemency requests from death row
inmates all five times they have been presented to him since he took
office in 1999. Davis has also rejected almost all parole requests
from killers and is facing a legal challenge to his parole practices
in the state Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Dane Gillette, who heads the capital appeals unit in the
California attorney general's office, said he was pleased that the
death sentence had been upheld but expressed surprise at the 9th
Circuit statements regarding clemency. "I never have seen anything
like this, certainly nothing so blatant or specific," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Given what I have read about this case and talking to the
attorneys who handled it, I don't think Tookie is a good candidate
for clemency under any circumstance," said Gillette, who emphasized
that this was his personal view because the attorney general's office
has no formal involvement in clemency matters.</TE>
<TE>   When an inmate applies for clemency, the district attorney's
office that prosecuted the case responds to the clemency petition.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Stratton, the chief federal public defender in Los Angeles,
whose office is now co-counsel for Williams, said she was "very
disappointed" in the ruling. She said the office had been hopeful
that the convictions and death sentence would be reversed.</TE>
<TE>   "We think Williams was ill-served by his trial lawyer and deserved
relief," Stratton said. "While it's very kind of the court to suggest
that we apply for clemency--which, of course, we will--we think the
court should have granted relief, and we will ask for a rehearing
urging them to do so."</TE>
<TE>   In his lengthy opinion, Hug first reviewed the facts of the murder
of 7-Eleven employee Albert Lewis Owens on Feb. 27, 1979. The
testimony included a statement from Alfred Coward, an immunized
government witness, who said he, Williams and two other men smoked
"sherms," cigarettes laced with PCP, before the robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Coward testified that Williams shot out the store's television
monitor before shooting Owens in the head with a sawed-off shotgun.
Coward also said the four men split $120 taken from the cash
register. He said, according to the court decision, that, later in
the day, "Williams told his brother about Owens, saying: 'You should
have heard the way he sounded when I shot him.' Williams then made a
growling noise and laughed hysterically for a number of minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Hug also reviewed the murder of motel owner Robert Yang, his wife
and daughter at the Brookhaven Motel on South Vermont Avenue on March
11, 1979. Four witnesses provided testimony identifying Williams as
the perpetrator.</TE>
<TE>   The convictions were upheld by the state Supreme Court in 1988.
Eleven years later, U.S. District Judge Stephen J. Wilson in Los
Angeles rejected Williams' claims that his constitutional rights had
been violated. The 9th Circuit upheld that decision Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the appeals panel said it had been reasonable
for Williams' trial lawyer not to offer any mitigating evidence at
the penalty phase, emphasizing that Williams had said he wanted no
witnesses presented and that the attorney had interviewed potential
mitigation witnesses, including psychiatrists who had examined
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, now 48, has been on death row since 1981. In 1996, after
writing several books with writer Barbara C. Becnel warning youths of
the perils of gang life, he became the subject of feature stories by
journalists across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, Mario Fehr, a member of the Swiss parliament and
an opponent of the death penalty, nominated Williams for the Nobel
Prize. Inner-city teachers said the books had had a very positive
impact on young students. But the Nobel nomination stirred an outcry
in law enforcement circles.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, state Deputy Atty. Gen. Lisa J. Brault, one of the
lawyers who argued the case successfully in the 9th Circuit, said she
was "very pleased" with the decision. "The focus should be on the 95
pages that discuss how Mr. Williams received a fair trial and [how]
the jury's verdict of death was proper, rather than the one-paragraph
suggestion that he might be worthy of clemency."</TE>
<TE>   Both Elisabeth Semel, who runs the death penalty clinic at UC
Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, and Daniel J. Kobil, a professor
at Capital Law School in Columbus, Ohio, and a clemency expert, said
they were unaware of any previous appellate decision in which the
judges made a similar clemency suggestion about a death row inmate.</TE>

<HD>Agency Under Review</HD>
<DH>Politics: City, county officials study ties to
Entertainment Industry Development Corp.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK MCGREEVY, ANITA M. BUSCH and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alarmed by a criminal probe of the quasi-public agency that provides
city and county film permits, the Los Angeles City Council took
emergency action Tuesday to review possible reforms of the
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., including whether council
members should continue to automatically serve on the agency's board.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the county Board of Supervisors--whose five
members also sit on the EIDC board--directed staff members to look
into its relationship with the agency. Some supervisors expressed
alarm at reports of political contributions and big spending by an
organization they helped create.</LD>
<LD>   The EIDC collects permit fees for the two government entities and
derives its budget by keeping a portion of the fees. Its board
includes entertainment executives as well as City Council members,
county supervisors and the mayor of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   "If the agency wants to spend money lavishly, and if that's how
it's done in Hollywood, they ought to do it with Hollywood dollars,"
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said. "These are public funds, and they
shouldn't be paying for it."</TE>
<TE>   In court papers filed to support search warrants served last week
on the corporation's Hollywood headquarters and the home of its
president, county prosecutors cited apparent misuse of public funds
on political contributions and opulent meals and trips to locales
such as resorts in France and Utah--the sites of major film
festivals.</TE>
<TE>   But it remains unclear whether the EIDC is a private corporation
or a public entity that must follow government restrictions against
political contributions and wasteful spending.</TE>
<TE>   Legal filings by city and county attorneys, some of which came to
public attention Tuesday, argue that the EIDC is in fact a private
corporation.</TE>
<TE>   That contention came in court papers responding to a federal
lawsuit filed by a photographer who alleged the EIDC did not properly
compensate him for using his location photos. That photographer,
Benjamin Pezzillo, has been in touch with county prosecutors since
last year, his lawyers say.</TE>
<TE>   When he filed his lawsuit on March 1, Pezzillo sought compensation
from the EIDC as well as the city and county. But the city attorney's
office and county counsel's office both contended that they were not
liable because the EIDC is "a privately operated, independent
contractor."</TE>
<TE>   That closely matches the description of the agency by its own
attorneys, who argue that the EIDC must be free to imitate the
opulent spending and political contributions of the Hollywood studios
it services and woos.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shocked, shocked that different arms of the county government
would be taking inconsistent legal positions," said EIDC attorney
George Newhouse, adding that the money the corporation spends on
parties at film festivals and posh Westside dinners does not
constitute public funds.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant County Counsel John Krattli said Tuesday that the filing
in federal court does not represent the county's opinion on the
overall legal status of the EIDC. Instead, he said, it merely argues
that the corporation is not an administrative unit of the county and
therefore the county is not liable for its actions.</TE>
<TE>   "That document did not address the issues that are confronting us
now," Krattli contended.</TE>
<TE>   At the EIDC's inception, the Los Angeles city attorney's office,
then headed by the current mayor, James K. Hahn, was informed by the
state Fair Political Practices Commission that the corporation was a
"local government agency." But the assistant city attorney who
received that letter, Anthony Alperin, in an e-mail to a cultural
commissioner earlier this year, said the EIDC was not a "government
agency."</TE>
<TE>   And the city attorney's office also filed papers in the federal
court suit arguing that the EIDC is a private contractor rather than
a government entity.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to sort out what exactly this organization is," Josh
Perttula, special assistant city attorney, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council called for such a review Tuesday morning on a
10-1 vote. Reacting to a call from Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley to
reconsider the city's relationship to the film agency, Councilman
Nick Pacheco said a review is necessary to address allegations that
the EIDC may have improperly made political contributions to elected
officials on its board, such as himself.</TE>
<TE>   "If the district attorney's office concludes that there is a
conflict, one solution is to remove us from the board," said Pacheco,
who has received $1,000 from the agency and is due to be feted at an
EIDC fund-raiser next week.</TE>
<TE>   The motion adopted by the City Council said recent reports about
EIDC operations "raise legitimate concerns over the city's continued
participation in this joint city-county-industry effort."</TE>
<TE>   Several council members said the corporation has done a good job
of expediting film permits and keeping the movie business in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully we don't get onto this bandwagon of 'Let's crucify them
and throw a lot of dirt at them' when we really don't know what is
happening," Councilman Ed Reyes cautioned.</TE>
<TE>   At the Hall of Administration, county supervisors were befuddled
to find themselves on the board of an agency that they had paid
little attention to.</TE>
<TE>   "What exactly is our relationship to this thing?" asked Supervisor
Gloria Molina, who laughed when she was told that she sits on the
executive board of the $3-million agency. She said she has never
attended a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The agency was formed in 1995 during a push to privatize city
services headed by former Mayor Richard Riordan. At the time, Los
Angeles was losing film jobs to cheaper locations such as Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The city and county passed motions forming the EIDC as a nonprofit
public benefit agency and signed contracts with the corporation to
handle film permits. Permits to shut down city streets can still be
acquired through the city or county, but almost all crews go through
the EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Pezzillo entered into a contract with the EIDC to
photograph more than 200 film locations in Los Angeles for the
agency's "location library," according to court papers.</TE>
<TE>   He contends the EIDC kept his photographic negatives, insisted
that it held the copyrights and used them illegally in its
literature. The EIDC has denied the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Pezzillo checked the Internet and discovered the EIDC's odd
status, according to his attorney, Rhonda Fossbinder.</TE>
<TE>   In July 2001, Pezzillo began writing to prosecutors and city and
county officials alleging that the EIDC was violating the law, she
said. He soon got a call back from the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors would not say whether Pezzillo's complaints sparked
their inquiry.</TE>

<HD>Latest Fish Plan: Quotas</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Federal body, in a compromise aimed at helping
industry, proposes severe curbs on several species to take effect
next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>In a compromise move to give some relief to the beleaguered West
Coast fishing industry, a federal regulatory council Tuesday proposed
replacing a current ban on commercial fishing with strict new quotas
along the Southern California continental shelf.</LD>
<LD>   The quotas, to take effect beginning next year, are subject to
final review by the U.S. Commerce Department, which is expected to
approve them.</LD>
<LD>   The strictest quota--for bocaccio, a popular but severely depleted
rockfish species--was cut to 20 tons, down 80% from a year ago. The
change is intended to allow incidental harvest, or "by-catch," of
bocaccio by fishermen who are targeting other fish.</LD>
<TE>   The Pacific Fisheries Management Council, the regional body that
regulates Pacific Coast fishing, also recommended severe cuts in 2003
quotas for several other fish types and called for increased
surveillance to ensure that the limits are enforced.</TE>
<TE>   New rules, effective this week, will allow coastal commercial
fishing to restart immediately in Northern California, Oregon and
Washington, but with depth restrictions on where fish can be taken by
trawlers.</TE>
<TE>   The changes could provide some breathing room for the fishing
industry, which, because of alarm over declining supplies of bocaccio
and dark-blotched rockfish, has been barred from the continental
shelf in Southern California since July and north of Cape Mendocino
since Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The ban marked the first time the entire West Coast shelf has been
closed to commercial fishing since federal regulation of the industry
began in 1976, according to council officials.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, California fishermen reached the annual 100-ton
bocaccio limit by June, triggering the July 1 prohibition against
shelf fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups attending the Portland meeting were skeptical
that by-catch totals could be limited to 20 tons because of
inaccurate counts. Conservation groups also believe that a zero catch
limit on the fish is necessary to rebuild the population, a process
that still could take more than a century.</TE>
<TE>   "This proposal will not protect bocaccio adequately and is
contrary to the requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act to rebuild
overfished species," said Mark Powell of Ocean Conservancy, a
Washington, D.C.-based conservation organization. The 1976 Magnuson
Act established fishing regulations under the jurisdiction of the
Commerce Department.</TE>
<TE>   In his testimony before the council on Tuesday, Bill Robinson, an
official of the National Marine Fisheries Service, admitted that
setting the 20-ton limit required a creative reinterpretation of the
law, which requires that quotas be set based on the estimated
recovery of the fish population over 10 years. Because bocaccio have
long life spans and low fertility rates, scientists estimate it could
take from 100 to 300 years for the fish population to recover.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Huhtala, program director for the Oregon-based Pacific
Marine Conservation Council, which represents fishermen as well as
some environmentalists, characterized the Pacific Fisheries
Management Council's proposals for California bocaccio Tuesday as a
concession to the state's $4.5-billion recreational fishing industry.
About 60% of bocaccio are caught by recreational fishermen in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "The consequences of closing recreational fishing are too onerous
for them," Huhtala said.</TE>
<TE>   The opening day of hearings at the annual meeting of the council,
held in a packed Doubletree Hotel ballroom overlooking the Columbia
River in Portland, also featured public testimony from fishermen and
their families that included tales of economic ruin caused by federal
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the fishermen disputed the scientific data leading up to
the current ban.</TE>
<TE>   "The scientists are way ... off base," said John Fuqua, 30, a
charter fishing captain from Oxnard. "There's more bocaccio out there
than I've ever seen in my life. Twenty metric tons of bocaccio is not
going to do anything. It might as well be zero."</TE>
<TE>   The council announced Tuesday that regulations would be relaxed
north of Cape Mendocino, allowing fishermen to go back to work, at
least temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   However, in a move that many see as a signal of the future of
regulation on the coast, the new council rules created a conservation
area, closing waters from 100 to 250 fathoms, where most of the
dark-blotched rockfish are found, to commercial trawlers. The rules
immediately reopened fishing grounds outside 250 fathoms. The area
inside 100 fathoms will reopen Oct. 1.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Aides Probe Outside LAPD Chief Hopefuls</HD>
<DH>Candidates: The mayor oversees checks on work and
reputations of applicants from other cities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn is sending his most trusted aides to
the home cities of seven applicants for chief of police to review
their work and reputations.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn said he wants as much information as possible about the
candidates from outside the Los Angeles Police Department, several of
whom he has never met. Others say it will give the mayor political
cover if he selects a chief from within the LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 13 candidates still being considered to run the LAPD, six
work for the department and seven work or have worked in other law
enforcement agencies. The mayor is replacing former Chief Bernard C.
Parks, who was denied a second five-year term.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we know the inside candidates," Hahn said. "I think the
outside candidates are the ones that we need to get a good
understanding of, how they were viewed."</TE>
<TE>   Tim McOsker, the mayor's chief of staff, met last week with
officials in Philadelphia about former Police Chief John Timoney.
McOsker went to Sacramento to discuss Chief Arturo Venegas and to
Cambridge, Mass., and Chicago to discuss Cambridge Chief Ronnie
Watson. Watson spent 30 years in Chicago before becoming head of the
department in Cambridge several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   McOsker briefed the Police Commission in a closed session Tuesday
on the information he had gleaned.</TE>
<TE>   "What he got were pretty honest assessments of each of these
candidates," said Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook. "People should
expect the mayor to do as much due diligence as possible in every
area and to make the best decision he can."</TE>
<TE>   Later this week, McOsker will meet with officials in New York City
to discuss former Police Commissioner William Bratton, and Deputy
Mayor Roberta Yang is expected to travel to Portland, Ore., to meet
with officials there about Chief Mark Kroeker, a former LAPD deputy
chief. She also is expected to go to Oxnard to talk about Chief Art
Lopez, who also previously worked for the LAPD, and to Santa Ana to
discuss Chief Paul Walters.</TE>
<TE>   McOsker and Yang are expected to brief the Police Commission again
next week.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso said that he strongly
supports McOsker's efforts and that they have been helpful to the
five-member panel.</TE>
<TE>   The commission, which last week completed its interviews of the 13
candidates, is expected to narrow its recommendation to three people
before handing the final decision to the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "This briefing today was very helpful," Caruso said. "It really
confirmed what a lot of our conclusions were about the candidates."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso also said he will make telephone calls to the outside
candidates' bosses and others to determine still more about them.
Hahn said he will do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Officials who met with McOsker on his trip last week said the
conversation focused on several areas, including the candidates'
records, their management skills, whether they would be willing to
reform the department and how they would handle leading such a large
organization.</TE>
<TE>   David L. Cohen, the executive vice president of Comcast Corp. who
previously worked as the chief of staff to the mayor in Philadelphia,
said that McOsker "asked all the right questions" and that he wanted
to discuss Timoney's record and whether he was an effective leader.
They also talked about the advantages and disadvantages of hiring
inside versus outside candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is an incredibly smart way of going about this,
particularly for the outside candidates and particularly for the
outside candidates for a police department," Cohen said. "It
definitely helps inform the process.... Police departments are very
difficult political organizations in any city."</TE>
<TE>   Cambridge City Manager Robert Healy said he had a "good, frank
conversation" with McOsker about Watson's skills, strengths and other
attributes. He said they discussed the challenges of leading a large
organization compared with a much smaller one.</TE>
<TE>   Healy said he believes that Watson would be capable of leading a
bigger department, given his three decades in Chicago's police
department. Healy also said they discussed whether Watson is a strong
disciplinarian and whether he would be willing to make needed reforms
in the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "He's certainly progressive," Healy said. "I think we're all
realistic to know that you don't turn a large institution on its head
overnight. He's a strong advocate for integrity and discipline."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Dist. Atty. Lynne Abraham confirmed through her
spokeswoman that she had met with McOsker but would not comment on
their conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Although some praised Hahn's efforts to vet his candidates, others
said the more important question is whether he is learning the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Gary Greenebaum, who served on the Police Commission until
he resigned in 1995, said choosing an outside candidate is difficult
for a number of reasons, including the fact that those candidates are
entering unfamiliar territory without internal support.</TE>
<TE>   He said former Chief Willie L. Williams knew no one in the
department when he was hired in 1992, and ended up promoting the
commander who drove him around the city in his first few days on the
job.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was the first outsider hired in more than four decades to
lead the department; his successor, Parks, was an LAPD veteran.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the biggest learning curves imaginable," Greenebaum
said. "The world of the LAPD is a very complex culture and structure
with 10,000 people in it that you don't know."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has said he is looking for someone who will lower the
crime rate, improve morale, reform the department and strengthen
community policing programs.</TE>
<TE>   Aides, however, said the mayor probably will make his decision on
a number of factors, high among those whether Hahn feels compatible
and comfortable with the person.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor's personal opinion ... is probably the most important
factor," Middlebrook said.</TE>

<LD>I wasn't going to call, and then I was, and then I wasn't.</LD>
<LD>   Of all my memories from a year ago, two stand apart. One is being
awakened by the sobbing that came through the wall of my hotel room,
a steady, invisible cry both distant and near.</LD>
<LD>   The other is a brief encounter with a father searching the streets
of New York for his daughter, a photo of her tucked under his arm,
even though he knew she was gone.</LD>
<TE>   I can't fully explain it even now, but I felt lucky to have met
that man. Even with smoke curling over Manhattan, the attack felt
remote and unidentifiable for several days. I didn't appreciate the
full weight of Sept. 11 until I came across this ordinary gent from
Indiana who walked the streets wearing his daughter's death.</TE>
<TE>   Katie McCloskey had gone to New York on a dream, and she
occasionally called home to South Bend from her office on the 97th
floor of one of the World Trade Center towers to say she couldn't
believe she'd made it to the big city. She was 25.</TE>
<TE>   The McCloskeys and I have talked a few times since then. I've
visited their home in Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   I've felt privileged to be let into their hearts; I've never known
what to say.</TE>
<TE>   For the one-year anniversary, I wasn't going to call, and then I
was, and then I wasn't. I was torn between respecting Dick
McCloskey's privacy and wanting to maintain this connection with the
one man who had hugged me on the street, a total stranger, and
implored me with simple elegance and grace to "say good things."</TE>
<TE>   His humanity humbles me to this day. In the midst of an
unfathomable personal loss, and a horrible moment in history, he made
an appeal to the force for good in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Say good things about those who died and about those who grieve
for them, he had said. Say good things about a world with at least as
much generosity as cruelty.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, I can't comply without qualification.</TE>
<TE>   I still have not a solitary good thing to say about anyone
associated with the incineration of so many innocent people. I have
not one good word for egomaniacal fanatics who promote ignorance,
kill for God, treat women like dogs and teach hatred to children of
poverty.</TE>
<TE>   As for Americans, we haven't learned that as citizens of the
world, we'll always be loathed for being the fat kid at the birthday
party, for foreign policy that is more often about corporate greed
than global good, and for loading missiles onto bombers when we don't
get our way.</TE>
<TE>   But for Dick McCloskey one year later, I'm going to be optimistic,
naive--whatever you want to call it--and say that his daughter Katie
died for the sake of making us consider the meaning of our lives, and
for the sake of uniting us in cold reflection on the preciousness of
life.</TE>
<TE>   I passed her father's hug on to my father, and to my sons. I don't
know where it comes from, but I'm grateful for the smile on my wife's
face when we wake each morning, and I love that she still cries over
the 3,000-and-some Katie McCloskeys in New York, Washington and
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Say good things?</TE>
<TE>   The McCloskeys taught their children tolerance, and Katie's
boyfriend was of a different race. She was killed by religious bigots
who attacked the most open society in the world.</TE>
<TE>   We're flawed, of course, and we've got our own great divides. But
I'm writing this in an international city and multicultural state
that stand as the world's most spectacular arguments and best hope
against the despotic, narrow world imagined by the terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't going to call, and then I was, and then I did.</TE>
<TE>   The moment Dick McCloskey said hello, I was glad to hear his
voice.</TE>
<TE>   It'll be a difficult week, of course, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he was pleased about a monument in Katie's name that was
unveiled at the local cemetery Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   And Mr. McCloskey was proud to say a local girl had just headed
off to Purdue University with the first scholarship named for his
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. McCloskey had dinner with the student Saturday night and had
nothing but good things to say.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone wishing to make a donation can send a check to the Katie
McCloskey Memorial Scholarship Fund in care of the Community
Foundation of St. Joseph's County, P.O. Box 837, South Bend, IN

<HD>Man Fled Debts, Not Homicide, Jury Told</HD>
<DH>Trial: Hugh 'Randy' McDonald, a Newport Beach attorney,
killed a client's wife, then faked suicide, prosecution says. Defense
denies killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors on Tuesday described attorney Hugh "Randy" McDonald as a
manipulative man who murdered his client's wife, abandoned his family
and then faked his death by pretending to jump off the Golden Gate
Bridge.</LD>
<LD>   But on the first day of McDonald's murder trial in Santa Ana, his
attorney offered a far different picture of the former Newport Beach
lawyer.</LD>
<LD>   McDonald, Michael Molfetta said, was overwhelmed by trying to keep
up with the "Newport Beach lifestyle."</LD>
<TE>   In debt and depressed, he drove to the Golden Gate Bridge but at
the last moment decided not to jump.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the attorney said, McDonald started a new, simpler life
in Utah, unaware he was wanted for murder.</TE>
<TE>   The sharply diverging views come more than a year after McDonald
was arrested in the shooting death of a Villa Park woman.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Walt Schwarm told the seven-man, five-woman
jury that McDonald chased Janie Pang around her home on May 30, 1997,
with a gun and fatally shot her.</TE>
<TE>   A housekeeper fled the house with Pang's children and ran next
door to call police. Officials found Pang dead in a closet, crouched
in the fetal position.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarm did not offer a motive for the murder but pointed out that
Pang's husband, Danny, was a client of McDonald's law firm. At the
time of the murder, Pang owed the firm $20,000, of which McDonald was
to receive $4,000, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald fled to the Bay Area three days after the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, he placed his watch with his business
card attached on the ledge of the Golden Gate Bridge to make it look
like he jumped off.</TE>
<TE>   But Schwarm said it was a ruse designed to make authorities think
he was dead so he could start a new life in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   That same day, McDonald's wife (they've since divorced) received a
Federal Express package from him that contained two cassette tapes,
documents transferring property ownership and two books on how to
cope with suicide.</TE>
<TE>   In the tapes, played to jurors on Tuesday, McDonald laid out their
finances and told Karen he took $2,500 from their checking account.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to throw myself a party for my last two days on
Earth," McDonald said. "I'm sorry I put you in a horrible position. I
just feel sick about it."</TE>
<TE>   Police eventually tracked McDonald down in Utah, but he left
before they could arrest him. In his apartment, they said they found
hair dye, mailbox agreements, letterheads with fake names and a book
titled titled "How to Completely Disappear and Never be Found."</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested last year in Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   But Molfetta said that McDonald isn't a murderer and that he left
Orange County to escape depression and a loveless marriage. He denied
the lawyer ever tried to disguise himself.</TE>
<TE>   The defense says several witnesses, including the maid and Pang's
6-year-old son, pointed to another man during a photo lineup.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald fled because his wife "wanted to live in Newport Beach
where she could live the life that Randy wanted nothing to do with,"
Molfetta said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not running from law enforcement," Molfetta said. "He's
running from his life in Newport Beach."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's ex-wife, Karen, testified for the prosecution Tuesday,
saying the family was going through financial hard times when her
husband disappeared. They owed $65,000 in credit-card debts and had
to come up with tuition for their daughter's school.</TE>
<TE>   She said McDonald is not capable of hurting anyone. His son, John,
also testified for the prosecution. He waved at his father as he
entered and left the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I still love him. Absolutely," he testified. "I feel anger toward
the situation. I feel anger at the abandonment, but it doesn't
diminish that I love him."</TE>

<HD>County Puts Focus on Security</HD>
<DH>Terror: Response to 9/11 includes new measures and
increased vigilance by law enforcement agencies, airports, water
district and the port.</DH>

<LD>Walking in Washington, D.C., Ventura County Undersheriff Craig
Husband heard the explosion when American Airlines Flight 77 slammed
into the Pentagon across the Potomac River.</LD>
<LD>   Husband, in the nation's capital for a law enforcement conference,
saw hundreds of panicked government employees pour out of office
buildings after learning of the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "Everything shut down and Washington turned into a ghost town. I
just wanted to go home and be with my family," he said.</LD>
<TE>   A year later, Ventura County law enforcement and public health
officials are still learning from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
while fine tuning a response plan in the event of a local strike.</TE>
<TE>   There are regular patrols now at Oxnard and Camarillo airports and
at the Port of Hueneme, officials said. Communication has vastly
improved between federal and local law enforcement agencies,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The county's largest water provider--responsible for delivering
supplies to 80% of Ventura County residents--has hired security
officers and shored up anti-contamination measures at its six
reservoirs and along 135 miles of pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Husband said commanders receive regular briefings from
intelligence officers in the county's Terrorism Working Group, made
up of department representatives and public health officials.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies and commanders trained to chase down criminals have added
to their duties the gathering of information on possible terrorist
attacks, Husband said.</TE>
<TE>   "It altered our mission and expanded it," he said of the events of
Sept. 11. "We view our mission now as one in which the front-line
officer could get information that is a small piece of the puzzle
that might provide info on a terrorist attack."</TE>
<TE>   The World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks demonstrated how local
police and fire departments can be thrust into warlike events long
before military personnel are dispatched.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned from that experience that local law enforcement are
the first people to respond," Husband said. "We have a primary role
in protecting our residents from terrorist attacks. It's the local
beat cop that sees everything. It's not going to be someone in
Washington."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 300 of the Sheriff Department's 800 sworn officers, as well
as dispatchers and other non-sworn employees, have undergone
intensive counterterrorism and bioterrorism training. More training
is planned, he said.</TE>
<TE>   County firefighters observed how their New York City colleagues
responded to the initial attacks and subsequent fires.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned how fragile life is," said county Fire Chief Bob
Roper. "The public is still looking for us to take immediate action
[in a suspicious incident], but we will take a couple of minutes to
question what is really going on."</TE>
<TE>   County fire officials are awaiting about $2 million in federal
money for additional equipment needed to combat a potential
bioterrorist attack, Roper said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, officials with the Calleguas Water District said that
the threat of possible contamination forced them to spend nearly
$250,000 on new security measures.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing we did was acquire special equipment that can
detect subtle changes in the water," General Manager Don Kendall
said. "Clearly [the Sept. 11 attacks] made us more vigilant and
looking for anything that is out of the ordinary. We are in perpetual
lock-down now."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, the water district, which serves more than
600,000 county residents, has instituted a strict badge screening
process for employees and visitors to its six reservoirs and
administrative offices, Kendall said.</TE>
<TE>   Security guards now patrol the reservoirs 24 hours a day, and
three are assigned to the agency's largest treated water reservoir,
10,000-acre-foot Lake Bard between Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   All access points along the district's complex system of
underground water pipes that cross the county have also been secured,
Kendall said. No longer are access covers secured by metal bolts.
Since Sept. 11, all have been welded shut, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Port of Hueneme, Coast Guard officials concerned about
proximity to Naval Base Ventura County stepped up security at each
entrance and instructed harbor pilots who guide container ships into
port on ways to detect possible terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no reports of suspicious activity at the port,
said Jess Herrera, vice president of the Oxnard Harbor District.</TE>
<TE>   At Oxnard Airport, the only one in the county with commercial jet
service, police officers are present during aircraft operations.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Art Lopez said the airport security detail is among
the many changes that have taken place at his department in the
months after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   A new position was created for an intelligence officer, who is
assigned to filter through the dozens of faxes and e-mails from
federal and state law enforcement agencies that reach the
department's headquarters daily.</TE>
<TE>   The city's proximity to the naval base, a potential terrorism
target, made it imperative that officers become more aware of
potential threats, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   "This has all heightened the awareness that we could potentially
have in our city weapons of mass destruction," Lopez said. "And
that's not something we ever thought about in an agricultural town
like Oxnard."</TE>

<LD>With the Angels, you don't just wait for the next shoe to drop. You
keep expecting a delivery guy to pull up with a truckload of Nikes.</LD>
<LD>   After wincing along with Troy Glaus when he jammed his fingers
sliding into second base Monday night, the organization clenched its
teeth and cast its eyes downward Tuesday following the news that
Anaheim police are investigating pitcher Jarrod Washburn for an
allegation of sexual assault on an unidentified female.</LD>
<LD>   Injuries are a part of any pennant race. But sexual assault
allegations?</LD>
<TE>   On the one hand, the Washburn situation goes beyond anything as
simple as an X-ray. On the other, it's only an allegation; no charges
have been filed against him.</TE>
<TE>   In a best-case scenario things work out the same way they did for
Clipper center Michael Olowokandi, who was arrested on suspicion of
cohabitant abuse, false imprisonment and robbery following
allegations by an ex-girlfriend in December. The accuser recanted her
story, the district attorney declined to press charges and Olowokandi
started playing the best ball of his career.</TE>
<TE>   In the worst-case scenario we're talking about a crime victim, the
betrayal of Washburn's wife and child, and a jail sentence that
causes him to miss seasons, not just a start or two.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime the Angels are in limbo.</TE>
<TE>   Will Washburn--the club's best starter with a 17-5 record and 3.32
earned-run average--be available for the duration of the stretch run?
If he can pitch, what will his state of mind be if he's the subject
of a lengthy investigation and/or criminal charges?</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia said he still plans to use Washburn in his
spot in the rotation Friday, or he might move him up to pitch the
final game of the Angels' four-game series against the Oakland A's
Thursday on three days' rest. (Although Tuesday could hardly be
considered a day of rest for Washburn.)</TE>
<TE>   Washburn left the ballpark to avoid the media swarm. The Angels'
clubhouse was without one of its happiest faces. Those who were
around talked about getting back to business.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one more test," General Manager Bill Stoneman said.
"They'll move forward, continue to play hard baseball, solid baseball
and win their share of games--with the focus on each game, just like
they've been doing."</TE>
<TE>   Then they went out and beat the hot-hot-hot A's, 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   We'll see if this group is more resilient than the 1997 Angels,
who went to pieces after Tony Phillips was arrested on felony cocaine
possession charges. They lost eight of their first 11 games following
his Aug. 10 arrest and lost 21 of 30. It didn't help that pitcher
Chuck Finley and catcher Todd Greene broke their wrists. The Angels
went from first place to another season of watching the Seattle
Mariners celebrate at their expense in the Kingdome, then watching
the playoffs from home.</TE>
<TE>   You get the sense that this group won't be derailed so easily.
They've fought through the injuries. Despite the unsettled labor
situation (Oakland's Eric Chavez said over the weekend that the
potential strike even made it hard for the A's to appreciate the
first 15 games of their 20-game winning streak), the Angels
maintained their professional demeanor and played winning baseball
even though all their efforts could have all been wiped out.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what needs to be done on the field," Scioscia said. "I
think our club will be able to maintain its focus."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, you wonder how badly Glaus injured his fingers. He
sprained the middle and ring fingers on his left hand. The Angels
have gone most of the season without him swinging the big bat. Just
when they appeared to have it back, with Glaus' two-homer game in
Baltimore, they lost it.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels say he's day-to-day, but that's what they said about
Tim Salmon after he was hit in the hand by a pitch in July, and he
was out for 18 games.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow this team leads the wild-card race despite going three
weeks without Salmon, two weeks without closer Troy Percival and the
last two weeks without starter Aaron Sele.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries are pretty routine, even if the Angels have always found
creative ways to get hurt (like stumbling into the dugout or falling
behind home plate).</TE>
<TE>   Sexual assault allegations are entirely different.</TE>
<TE>   It's something to take very seriously; one step shy of the worst
offense an athlete or anyone else can commit. On the other hand, I'm
always leery of allegations made against athletes or other public
figures. Fame and fortune have a way of altering tales of the truth.
I always take the standard presumption of innocence.</TE>
<TE>   And when it comes to this Angel team's ability to overcome
obstacles, they've already earned the benefit of the doubt.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Texas Rangers abandoned the long ball for one night, and still
beat the Seattle Mariners.</LD>
<LD>   Texas' record streak of 27 games with a home run came to an end,
but pinch-hitter Todd Greene drove in the go-ahead run with an
infield chopper in Tuesday night's 3-2 victory over the Mariners at
Arlington, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   "We didn't get one, but the home run record is already ours," said
catcher Ivan Rodriguez, who went two for three. "It's good to beat a
contending team by doing the little things. We've got a chance to do
some damage in our division."</LD>
<TE>   The Rangers had gone 50 consecutive games with at least one homer
at The Ballpark in Arlington.</TE>
<TE>   Greene's grounder in the eighth inning against Arthur Rhodes with
the infield in was chopped so high that third baseman Desi Relaford
had to take the out at first, allowing pinch-runner Donnie Sadler to
score from third.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you just can't catch a break," Relaford said. "It was a
decent pitch, but you've got a fast runner on third. You've got a guy
known for hitting fly balls and striking out and he chops one. But he
did his job."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle wasted another opportunity to help itself in the American
League wild-card race, leaving 11 runners on base.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners had seven baserunners in the first three innings, but
they managed only one run during that span.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners scored a run in the second with the help of a
throwing error by starter Kenny Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   Singles by Dan Wilson and Jeff Cirillo put runners on first and
second, and Ichiro Suzuki bunted. Rogers' off-balance throw to third
got past Herbert Perry and Wilson scored.</TE>
<TE>   Texas tied the score, 1-1, in the second on Carl Everett's
run-scoring groundout.</TE>
<TE>   New York 5-3, Baltimore 2-1--Raul Mondesi homered and Jeff Weaver
pitched well in a rare start, and the Yankees completed a sweep of a
split doubleheader at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Juan Rivera drove in two runs, including a tiebreaking
single in the seventh, and Andy Pettitte (10-5) gave up one run in 7
1/3 innings in the first game.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver (9-11), making his second start since Aug. 1, gave up one
run and four hits in eight innings. The Yankees have won seven of
eight and reduced their magic number to 10 for clinching their fifth
consecutive AL East title. Baltimore has lost 16 of 17.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 11, Detroit 4--Torii Hunter hit a three-run homer in the
first inning for Minnesota and threw out two runners from center
field at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Dustan Mohr went three for four with a homer for the Twins, who
lowered their magic number to five for clinching the AL Central and
earning their first playoff berth since winning the World Series in
1991. Detroit has lost 11 of 13.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 12, Tampa Bay 1--John Burkett (11-7) gave up one run and
six hits in seven innings at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Burkett had been 0-4 with an 8.47 earned-run average in his
previous seven starts.</TE>
<TE>   Manny Ramirez homered for the second consecutive game and has
seven homers and 20 runs batted in against Tampa Bay this season.
Doug Mirabelli and Nomar Garciaparra each hit two-run homers.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Cleveland 4--Mark Wohlers (2-4) threw Vernon Wells'
ninth-inning grounder into center field, allowing Shannon Stewart to
score the go-ahead run from second base at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland's Victor Martinez, making his major league debut,
singled to drive in two runs in the seventh to tie the score, 4-4.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 12, Kansas City 4--Jeff Liefer hit his first career grand
slam, and Paul Konerko drove in three runs at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals tied a club record with their eighth consecutive loss
at home.</TE>
<TE>   Konerko reached 100 RBIs for the first time in his career.</TE>

<HD>Angels Remain Focused on Field</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Washburn investigation doesn't affect Anaheim's
resolve during a 5-2 victory over Oakland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They could have cracked when faced with adversity and blamed their
history for setting a lasting precedent. But the Angels, confronted
anew by challenges to their competitiveness and their resolve, again
responded impressively.</LD>
<LD>   Right-hander Ramon Ortiz held the Oakland A's hitless for 5 1/3
innings and closer Troy Percival earned his 36th save in 40
opportunities as the Angels crafted a 5-2 victory before a lively
crowd of 35,323 Tuesday at Edison Field. It might someday be seen as
a turning point in their season, because earlier in the day, the
Angels learned that pitcher Jarrod Washburn is under investigation
for alleged sexual assault.</LD>
<LD>   That could have shaken them. Instead, they bounced back from their
series-opening loss, fueled by a three-RBI performance from Scott
Spiezio and run-scoring doubles by Shawn Wooten in the third inning
and Garret Anderson in the eighth. The Angels moved back within two
games of the division-leading A's and with 18 games left padded their
lead in the wild-card race to five games over the Seattle Mariners,
who lost to Texas.</LD>
<TE>   "This team has had a lot of things to overcome," Spiezio said
after the Angels won for the 11th time in 12 games and Oakland lost
for only the third time in 25 games. "This is just another one."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to play baseball," he said. "That's what we have to
do when we get on the field. Our guys have put these [distractions]
on the back burner all year and have come out with tunnel vision."</TE>
<TE>   That tunnel appears to lead to the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to keep it going," said Ortiz (13-9), who matched his
win total of last season and recorded his first career victory over
the A's after four losses. "I feel very good. The team wins.
Everybody is happy."</TE>
<TE>   Percival, the last of five Angel pitchers, entered the game with
two out in the eighth, only the third time this season he has been
summoned before the ninth inning. He got a little stiff while the
Angels scored their final two runs in the eighth, but he retired the
side in order in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't be talking about these things if not for our
bullpen," Scioscia said. "All the guys, they really got a lot of work
lately. They've been incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland's Ted Lilly (4-7) made his first start since July 20
against Texas. He had been on the disabled list because of an
inflammation in his left shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly had difficulty finding his rhythm in the first inning, and
the Angels capitalized.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio's two-run homer, his 10th of the season and first since
Sept. 1, was the key hit. David Eckstein led off the game by
grounding a single in the hole between short and third, and he went
to second when Lilly balked. Darin Erstad struck out, but Spiezio
teed off on a waist-high off-speed pitch and launched it into the
Angel bullpen in left field, ending an eight-for-46 slump.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio started the game at third for only the seventh time this
season. The move was necessary because Troy Glaus sprained the middle
and ring fingers of his left hand Monday while sliding headfirst into
second on a successful but painful steal.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels extended their lead to 3-0 in the third and ended
Lilly's outing.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz cruised through the first four innings, allowing only
back-to-back walks to David Justice and Mark Ellis in the second
inning. Hitters were contorted into corkscrews missing his fastball,
and his breaking ball kept them off balance.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz lost his no-hitter with one out in the sixth, when Ray
Durham poked a single through the right side of the infield. He lost
the shutout when Terrence Long pounded his first pitch for a home
run.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels gave themselves some breathing room in the eighth by
scoring twice against Ricardo Rincon on an infield single by Adam
Kennedy and two-out doubles by Spiezio and Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   For Spiezio, having played for Oakland for three seasons wasn't
his sole motivation Tuesday. "We're chasing them for the division
title, so it's a huge game," he said. "From here on out, we've got
nothing but big games."</TE>

<LD>The Angels closed the clubhouse door Tuesday afternoon, holding a
team meeting to inform players that pitcher Jarrod Washburn was under
investigation for alleged sexual assault. With few details available,
most players--including team leader Darin Erstad--declined to
comment.</LD>
<LD>   But the Angels didn't lose focus when they got off to the worst
start in franchise history. And, with a playoff berth close at hand,
closer Troy Percival said no one in Tuesday's meeting had to remind
players to keep their focus on the field.</LD>
<LD>   "When we were 6-14, nothing had to be said," Percival said. "We
knew we were a good team then. We know we're a good team now.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody in this group is inexperienced enough to have to have
somebody come up to them and say, keep your focus."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plan to put tickets on sale Sept. 21 for potential
division series games at Edison Field. Tickets will be sold for the
first round of the playoffs only, with American League championship
series and World Series sales depending upon the Angels advancing in
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman and pinch-running specialist Chone Figgins has
three at-bats in his first three weeks in the major leagues, but
he'll get plenty of playing time after the season ends. Figgins is
one of six players selected by the Angels for the Arizona Fall
League, limited to top prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Class-A Rancho Cucamonga right-hander Bobby Jenks, whose
performance has not yet approached the promise evident in his 100-mph
fastball, also was picked, along with right-hander Chris Bootcheck
and outfielder Nathan Haynes from triple-A Salt Lake, outfielder
Kenny James from double-A Arkansas, and Rancho Cucamonga right-hander
Derrick Turnbow, who pitched in Anaheim in 2000 before arm surgery
last season set back his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' triple-A Salt Lake affiliate staged a dramatic
comeback to win the first game of the best-of-five Pacific Coast
League championship series Tuesday, scoring four times in the ninth
inning for a 7-5 victory over Edmonton.</TE>

<HD>Yankees Won't Penalize Wells</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Wells won't be disciplined by the New York Yankees for his
early-morning fight in a diner last weekend.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Brian Cashman met with the pitcher for about 30
minutes during the first game of Tuesday's split doubleheader with
Baltimore and informed Wells of the decision.</LD>
<LD>   "There was no discipline taken because there was no discipline
warranted," Cashman said. "I talked to the police and got a good
sense of what went on.</LD>
<TE>   "The matter is closed as far as the Yankees are concerned. He'll
pitch Thursday night."</TE>
<TE>   After beating the Detroit Tigers on Friday night, Wells was at a
Manhattan diner at about 5:50 a.m. Saturday with a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Rocco Graziosa, 27, of Yonkers, N.Y., walked in with some friends
and began talking with Wells. After the conversation, Graziosa went
to his table and made a remark about Wells' mother, who is dead.</TE>
<TE>   Graziosa then grabbed a butter knife off the table, began waving
it and attacked Wells, police said. Wells was punched in the head and
lost two teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Graziosa was arrested and charged with assault and menacing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston outfielder Manny Ramirez was fined an undisclosed amount by
Manager Grady Little for not running out a grounder in Monday's game
against Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez hit a check-swing grounder to pitcher Tanyon Sturtze in
the third inning, and immediately headed toward the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Little thought about taking Ramirez out at that time but opted not
to when Ramirez apologized to his teammates in the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Grady and Little talked at length before Tuesday's game against
the Devil Rays, and Ramirez was in the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "It's done," said Little.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Cub catcher Todd Hundley was fined for missing the team
picture Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Hundley and reliever Kyle Farnsworth were the only players to miss
the picture. But Cub interim Manager Bruce Kimm said Farnsworth was
excused because he had a doctor's appointment.</TE>
<TE>   "Todd's been fined and that's pretty much it," Kimm said without
specifying the amount.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati put Sean Casey and Brandon Larson on the 15-day
disabled list, effectively ending their seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Casey, the club's regular first baseman, has a torn muscle in his
left shoulder. Larson, a third baseman and backup outfielder, has a
broken left hand.</TE>

<HD>Rumors the Source of Baker's Irritation</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Francisco Giant Manager Dusty Baker has reacted strongly to a
report in the Chicago Tribune from unnamed sources, two of them
current managers, that Baker is interested in a potential opening
with the Chicago Cubs.</LD>
<LD>   "Who are these cowards," Baker said. "That's a cowardly act, not
to put your name with what you're saying. I challenge those cowards
to come see me."</LD>
<LD>   Sorry, Dusty, but "unnamed sources" sometimes don't even exist.</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: The Associated Press football poll was inaugurated in
1936. Which school finished first that year?</TE>
<TE>   Curious: Basketball coach Abe Lemons, who died recently, is
remembered for his snappy one-liners. Commenting on the high cost of
room service in New York, Lemons once quipped, "If it's $12 for eggs,
I want to meet the chicken."</TE>
<TE>   Rooting: Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco Chronicle: "President
Bush says National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice is 'constantly
telling me to watch out for the Irish.'</TE>
<TE>   "No, no, we're not considering attacking Dublin. She's talking
about Notre Dame football's rise under her former Stanford pal,
Tyrone Willingham."</TE>
<TE>   Mocking Martz: Mark Kiszla of the Denver Post, commenting on the
Broncos' 23-16 victory over the St. Louis Rams: "Denver beat St.
Louis, not because the Broncos had the better team, but because the
Rams were stuck with the far dumber coach.... The substance between
[Mike] Martz's ears is 75% ego and 25% air."</TE>
<TE>   Night and day: Penn State's game against Nebraska on Saturday has
an 8 p.m. kickoff. So how does Nittany Lion Coach Joe Paterno feel
about that?</TE>
<TE>   "I hate 12 o'clock games, I hate 3 o'clock games, I hate night
games," he said. "I love 1 o'clock games. And if it wasn't for the
darned television, we'd play 1 o'clock games. That's the way I think
you ought to play it, every week the same time."</TE>
<TE>   FYI: Bruce McNall, former owner of the L.A. Kings who spent four
years in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of bank fraud,
one count of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy, has finished
work on his autobiography, which is scheduled to be released next
July by Hyperion Books.</TE>
<TE>   The working title? "Fun While It Lasted."</TE>
<TE>   Dominating: "Serena and Venus Williams now have faced each other
in four of the last five Grand Slam finals," says Richard Burkhard of
Laugh-Line.com. "If this keeps up, the other women on the tour are
going to demand they pay a luxury tax."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1982, UCLA opened its football season
by routing Cal State Long Beach, 41-10. The Bruins went on to a
10-1-1 record, defeating Michigan in the Rose Bowl game, 24-14.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Minnesota, followed by Louisiana State and
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bill Scheft of Sports Illustrated says he just got
the John Madden 2003 football video game. He adds, "There's a warning
on the side of the package: 'Randy Moss may decide not to be
included.' "</TE>

<HD>Spirit Perseveres</HD>
<DH>Games' ideals had begun to be overtaken at Munich, but hope
remains today</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>OLGA CONNOLLY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"May joy and fellowship reign and, in this manner, may the Olympic
torch pursue its way through the ages ... ," wrote Pierre de
Coubertin in "Expression," a poetic reiteration of modern Olympic
precepts that were to "pave the way for a more valiant humanity,
stronger, and consequently more scrupulous and generous."</LD>
<LD>   To Coubertin, the Olympics were a meeting of nations, rather than
entertainment for nations. Olympic competitors, in his view,
showcased the vigor and capabilities of the people from whose ranks
they arose and, through appreciation of one another's skills,
promoted respect and peace.</LD>
<LD>   Since the beginning of the Modern Olympics in 1896, adherence to
Coubertin's precepts has waxed and waned. Munich in 1972, while
attempting to re-create Coubertin's idyllic Olympic family, instead
exposed the tragedy of the human family.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   These were my fifth consecutive Olympics Games. I was almost 40.</TE>
<TE>   When I married American hammer thrower Harold Connolly in 1957 and
immigrated to the United States, I was a fourth-year medical student
in Prague at Charles University. Upon my arrival to Washington, D.C.,
I received one single bit of advice from a State Department official:
To explore diligently the life in this land so that upon my
eligibility to become a naturalized citizen I could do so with a true
love and commitment.</TE>
<TE>   I followed that advice. When, 15 years later, I was elected to
carry the U.S. flag during the opening ceremony in Munich, I joyfully
and humbly exercised that privilege, which matched the honor of
winning a gold medal for Czechoslovakia in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   I loved Olympic competition. And I loved the Olympic village.
There, instead of fears, hatred and suspicion, curiosity about one
another led to efforts to communicate with everyone. The easygoing or
even more serious chats illustrated that Coubertin's vision of
building a civilized peaceful world was worth pursuing.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, although I had seen signs of it in previous Olympics, little
did I realize until Munich how vulnerable that vision had become to
criticisms that it was elitist and impractical.</TE>
<TE>   Records alone seemed to have captured the interests of millions
and, therefore, Munich embraced commercialization of sport as the way
toward progress.</TE>
<TE>   Amateur athletic principles lingered among the delegations of
nonwinners, but the statistically highest echelons were already
contracted by money.</TE>
<TE>   Specialized performance-enhancing pharmaceuticals were replacing
the glucose tablets, coffee and vitamins of the old times.</TE>
<TE>   Intense searches for wealthy sponsors shaped medals into bank-safe
keys. As the Dassler brothers' rival shoe companies, Adidas and Puma,
fought hard for publicity and worldwide sporting goods markets, they
showered favored competitors with free shoes and clothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Ordinary" Olympians began to think about leaving their countries
for places with better training facilities and publicity agents.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The women's discus throw was scheduled for the last day of track
and field competition. Having come to Munich in excellent physical
shape, with a new technical understanding of my event, I felt
confident.</TE>
<TE>   One day, however, several European women discus throwers entered
the weight room where I was finishing a training session. After an
exchange of hearty greetings I offered to share the bench press area.
They said they would wait.</TE>
<TE>   I then put on a show of strength with my maximum bench press
lifts--one push with each of about 180 and 185 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Then I watched them add to the rack another 30 pounds with which
to warm up. Oh, wow! The playing field was going to be much less
level than I'd expected.</TE>
<TE>   The excellence of European training systems, undoubtedly combined
with the effectiveness of steroid experimentation--this was before
stringent steroid testing--pushed up the statistics in women's sports
far more dramatically than in men's events.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, the competition became almost irrelevant. After
the events of Sept. 5, when a deadly hostage plot was implemented, we
were all numbed.</TE>
<TE>   I placed a flower at the fenced-in area in front of the Israeli
team's apartments.</TE>
<TE>   "That's for you," I whispered to the murdered Israeli athletes and
coaches. "The world abandoned you and I want you to know that I
grieve it."</TE>
<TE>   I was profoundly upset. The German police tried to save the
Israeli hostages through violent means. But since the terrorists had
stated to the whole world that their goal was to exchange the
athletes for prisoners from Israel's jail, I believed that Olympic
officials from all participating nations should have gone all out in
an effort to peacefully protect the athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Two nations that had participated with the Greeks in the Olympic
Games of antiquity, Egypt and Libya, offered possible shelters in
which negotiations could have been conducted. I believe that it might
have taken a few days, but had the world governments and Olympic
Committees ever internalized the fullness of Coubertin's work, the
Olympians would had been saved.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympic village, the greatest village on Earth, dropped the
Olympians' fate into the hands of Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir,
who refused any negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   How could the finest representatives of a country be so offered
for sacrifice! Earlier, an Israeli had told me that, should a
conflict develop at their borders, he and all other Israeli
Olympians-patriots would give up their long-dreamed-of competition
and go home to help. Who would ever have believed that their leaders
would choose grieving over negotiating!</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, things could not be dismissed with a sigh that Israel and
Palestine were at it again. Toward the end of the Games, German and
Scandinavian acquaintances shared with me their fervent wish that
Olympians answer the tragedy by some public commitment to building a
better world. There had to be a hopeful, constructive closure to
events that smeared with blood and death this page of Olympic
history. Therefore, I drafted, others translated into several
languages, and the staff of the Olympic village newspaper printed
this letter to Kurt Waldheim, then secretary general of the United
Nations:</TE>
<TE>   Dear Mr. Waldheim:</TE>
<TE>   We, the undersigned, the athletes and Olympic officials assembled
in Munich, Germany, from August 26, to September 10, 1972, appeal
earnestly to all peoples on earth to employ their brilliant and
sensitive minds toward a settlement of old disputes through genuine
dialogue rather than through violence. Only if all nations reconsider
their ancient hostilities with reason divorced from stubborn emotion,
the family of man will be able to break through the vicious circle of
mistrust, friction, conquest, and revenge, and be able to focus its
attention on the cooperation desperately needed for solving the
problems of poverty, lack of medical care, and the ever more
threatening environmental destruction that affects us all.</TE>
<TE>   Brothers and sisters that we are, we beg all nations to halt
further accumulation of weapons of mass destruction, and to cast away
the racial, religious, social and economic prejudices that have
traditionally and painfully separated us.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was displayed for Olympians' signatures, but the
Olympic village administrator accused us of bringing politics into
the Olympics and seized it immediately.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The competition, of course, did continue. On the morning of Sept.
10, four days after the memorial service for the slain Israelis, the
women's discus throwers were crowded at one throwing ring in a warmup
area. As competition began I tried desperately to stay with my new
technique, but the years of less efficient habits took over. Crushing
fatigue replaced the usual fire and gusto of absorption in the
contest. I did not qualify for the afternoon finals.</TE>
<TE>   I could not keep up with the new era in women's athletics. Slower
than slowly, I was walking out the stadium gate when a man stopped
me. He said his name was Erich Segal and that he was glad only the
athlete had broken down in me, rather than the human being. The
gentleness of the "Love Story" author's words and warmth of his
handshake woke me up from the blinded stupor of disappointment. Now I
could cry, but keep walking.</TE>

<TE>   Is the Olympic flame sturdy enough to pursue the path of peace
through the ages?</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years after Munich, the Norwegian Olympic Committee decided
that the legacy of world-class athletes should surpass statistics and
medals. Johann Olav Koss, winner of four golds in speedskating at the
Winter Games in Lillehammer became the first Ambassador for Olympic
Aid, which promotes health, dignity and athletic excellence among
children throughout the world. Multitudes have contributed to that
effort to restore fields of national fitness from which Olympians can
grow and become ambassadors of mutual respect and peace. Multitudes
keep aflame the joy and fellowship for which humanity so yearns.</TE>

a moment of silence for the 11 slain Israeli Olympians. Then came a
five-gun salute, as spotlights took turns playing on the Olympic
flag, which then was lowered and carried out of the stadium. Everyone
seemed relieved that the Games were finally finished.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Backyard Brawl"</LD>
<TE>   Author: W.K. Stratton</TE>
<TE>   Publisher: Crown Publishers</TE>
<TE>   Price: $24.95</TE>
<TE>   It took the Texas A&amp;M University football team nine years to score
against the University of Texas. The Aggies eventually earned their
first victory over the Longhorns by scoring 12 points in a 1902
shutout.</TE>
<TE>   Played the day after Thanksgiving each year, the battle between
Texas and Texas A&amp;M has become much more competitive--on and off the
field. W.K. Stratton, a fan and historian of the rivalry, documents
its entire history in "Backyard Brawl: Inside the Blood Feud Between
Texas and Texas A&amp;M."</TE>
<TE>   Stratton, a Texan who writes for Oklahoma Today and the Dallas
Morning News, found that, different from other popular college
football rivalries, many of which stretch across state lines, fans of
the burnt orange and maroon are "bitter rivals that can barely
stomach each other."</TE>
<TE>   Tire slashings, fights and near riots after games are just a few
manifestations of fan aggression recounted in this 288-page
hard-cover book.</TE>
<TE>   The rivalry, which ranks third in games played among major college
football programs, also has been built on positive foundations, such
as the many traditions of the schools, Stratton says. The Aggie
"Midnight Yell" stems from Texas A&amp;M's military background and takes
place at midnight before each year's big game.</TE>
<TE>   And there's the now-infamous Aggie "Bonfire," which, in 1999,
proved deadly when a mountain of lumber and flames collapsed on
students, killing 12.</TE>
<TE>   Stratton, who grew up an Aggie fan in Oklahoma after watching a
documentary on the school, also includes many of his personal
experiences at the Texas-Texas A&amp;M games. Details:

<HD>Dodgers Take Wrong Turn</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Brown can't stop their downward spiral and Giants
win, 5-2, for lead in wild-card race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>It is far too early for the Dodgers to panic. There are 18 games left
in the regular season, including five against San Francisco, and
they're only one game behind in the National League wild-card race
after yielding the top spot to the Giants on Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   It is not too early for the Dodgers to be very concerned,
though--not so much because of Tuesday night's 5-2 loss to the Giants
before 41,325 in Pacific Bell Park but because of the direction these
two playoff contenders are heading and the caliber of baseball they
are playing.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants have won five games in a row and 17 of 22, and they're
peaking at the right time. They're getting clutch hits, like Barry
Bonds' two-run single in the first inning Tuesday night, and making
superb defensive plays, like first baseman J.T. Snow's catch of Paul
Lo Duca's first-inning popup into a camera well in foul territory.</LD>
<TE>   Though San Francisco's bullpen has been shaky in recent weeks, the
Giants' rotation has jelled--right-hander Jason Schmidt (11-7)
followed Livan Hernandez's strong start Monday with a superb 7
2/3-inning effort, giving up two runs and six hits, and striking out
six, and left-hander Kirk Rueter, today's starter, has one loss in
his last nine starts.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have lost four straight and five of their last six,
and their 19-6 run from Aug. 7-Sept. 3 seems like a distant memory.
Their rotation is reeling from the temporary loss of Andy Ashby, who
missed Tuesday night's start because of a blister and an infection on
the middle finger of his pitching hand, and the loss of Kazuhisa
Ishii--probably for the rest of the season--because of a fractured
skull.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy turned to Kevin Brown, the erstwhile staff ace,
for some rotation relief Tuesday night, but the Dodger right-hander
was rocked for five runs and six hits, including Benito Santiago's
fifth-inning home run, in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   Since scoring 19 runs in a Sept. 2 demolition of Arizona, the
Dodgers have scored only 17 runs in seven games since. Third baseman
Adrian Beltre, who hit .370 with eight homers, 29 runs batted in and
29 runs in 35 games from July 26-Sept. 3, has one hit, no runs and no
RBIs in 26 at-bats, a slump that will probably force Tracy to drop
him from the third and fourth spots in the order.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca has four hits and no RBIs in 21 at-bats, and left fielder
Brian Jordan is seven for 32 since returning from a lower-back injury
on Sept. 1. Even leadoff batter Dave Roberts, who hadn't grounded
into a double play in 398 at-bats this season, bounced into a double
play in the sixth inning Tuesday, becoming the last major league
regular to ground into a double play in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "There's too much of the season left to look at it like this is
the beginning of the end; that's not realistic," Tracy said. "We
won't be downtrodden about this. [Today] is a big game for us,
because we'd like [to win and] leave here with a tie. We can't be
discouraged by this. We shouldn't be when only one game separates the
teams."</TE>
<TE>   Brown's performance wasn't all that encouraging. Making his first
start since May 26, Brown ran into immediate trouble when he gave up
singles to Kenny Lofton and Rich Aurilia to lead off the first and
walked Jeff Kent to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who leads the majors with a .364 average, lined a two-run
single to left-center, sending Kent to third. Bonds advanced on
Jordan's fielding error, but Brown escaped the second-and-third,
no-outs jam by inducing two infield pops and striking out Reggie
Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt's single and Lofton's double put runners on second and
third in the second, and Aurilia grounded to shortstop Alex Cora, who
threw home. Lo Duca swiped a tag underneath Schmidt's foot just
before Schmidt stepped on the plate, but umpire Ed Montague ruled
Schmidt safe. Replays showed Schmidt never touched the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Kent's RBI groundout made it 4-0, and Santiago added an insurance
run with his 15th homer of the season in the fifth. "I didn't see the
same pop he used to have on the ball," Santiago said of Brown.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers scored twice in the seventh on Shawn Green's 41st
homer of the season and Mark Grudzielanek's sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lost a couple of games here, we've lost four straight, but
we can't panic," Beltre said. "[The Giants] are playing pretty good
right now and we're not, but that doesn't mean they're going to stay
hot the rest of the season and we're not."</TE>

<HD>They Give Themselves a Pat on Back</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Being in playoff race has Dodgers feeling good
about their season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The final stretch of a tight playoff race seemingly isn't the best
time for reflection, but the Dodgers feel entitled.</LD>
<LD>   Being in postseason contention at this point of a season is an
accomplishment, and the Dodgers' surprising success is even sweeter
for them because of what they've overcome. Few clubs have faced the
front-office turmoil and off-field distractions this bunch has the
last four seasons, and now the Dodgers are sprinting to the finish
line with a sense of accomplishment.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Giants made things tougher for them on Tuesday
night, taking a one-game lead in the National League wild-card race
with a 5-2 victory at Pacific Bell Park. The Dodgers aren't satisfied
with what they've done; it's just that they know how far they've
already come.</LD>
<TE>   "I was thinking about that the other day, that this year really
has been a lot different than ... every year I've been here," said
third baseman Adrian Beltre, who made his major league debut in 1998.
"From the first year I got here, there's always been a lot of stuff
going on off the field. There were always people coming and going all
the time. You didn't really know what was going on.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, we've had pretty much the same team all year. We've
been together and nothing crazy has happened. We're getting the best
out of the situation and it shows. You can see what's happened by
what we've been able to do. We know we have a chance to get into the
playoffs now, and that would be special for all of us. You always
want to go to the playoffs, but it would mean even more for us."</TE>
<TE>   Said catcher Paul Lo Duca: "This team is more like a family than
it's ever been the last few years."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers began the season determined to put distance between
them and the recent tumultuous events at Chavez Ravine, hoping to
reemerge as a postseason contender while cleaning up the mess others
left behind. Mission accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   The organization is unified behind General Manager Dan Evans and
Manager Jim Tracy, proving people in those positions really can work
together. Players said the positive working environment has made a
difference.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing against the people that were here before, but Mr. Evans
and Trace really deserve a lot of credit for where we're at this late
in the race," infielder Alex Cora said. "With everything that was
going on here ... we're just in a better situation now.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of focusing on all that other stuff, we're focusing on
the Giants and the final month of a [playoff] race. The focus is
finally on the field, and look at what we've been able to do. It's
probably gratifying for them, what we're doing, but it's also
gratifying for us as players. Really."</TE>
<TE>   That was the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "There's obviously been some things that have surfaced over the
course of the last few years," Tracy said, "that became major
distractions from what takes place on the field. What we've done is
put the focus back where it belongs, and we've been very successful
as a result of it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an expectation level here now that was not here before.
There's an expectation level from the way we go about our business
from day-to-day, to the type of caliber of players that we're looking
for. There is distance. Lots of it."</TE>

<HD>Time Isn't Right for the Giants</HD>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers were surprised at comments in Tuesday's San Francisco
Chronicle from Giants' Executive Vice President Larry Baer, who
criticized them for not agreeing to move the start time of a Sept. 19
game to ease the Giants' travel burden.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco will finish a four-game series in Dodger Stadium
with a 7:10 game that night and must travel to Milwaukee for a game
the following night.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants asked the Dodgers for an earlier start so they could
arrive in Milwaukee at a decent hour, but the Dodgers, as they have
with several similar requests from the Giants in recent years,
declined.</LD>
<TE>   "When teams ask for things like this there is usually a
reciprocity that develops or doesn't develop," Baer said. "When you
ask, they usually accommodate you because they might be in the same
boat later. The level of reciprocity between us and the Dodgers is
lower than with most teams. When a request is made, more often than
not it is not honored."</TE>
<TE>   Derrick Hall, the Dodgers' senior vice president of
communications, said a Giants' official called the Dodgers early this
season with the request and was told that it probably would not be
honored.</TE>
<TE>   "Their response at the time was, 'OK, no big deal,' " Hall said.
"We didn't realize this was a big issue to them, so much so that
[Dodger President] Bob Graziano called Baer [Tuesday] to tell him he
was surprised. Because if we knew it was a major concern, we would
have worked with them and tried to compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "Our decision boils down to what's best for our fans and
viewership. We have a night game, when kids are in school, in the
prime-time [television] slot against the Giants. This has nothing to
do with the Giants and Dodgers. It has to do with our fans and what's
best for them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby was scratched from Tuesday night's start because of a
blister and an infection on the middle finger of his pitching hand,
but the Dodger right-hander was thankful his condition was diagnosed
and treated quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby, who is scheduled to start Sunday in Colorado, went on the
disabled list in June of 2000 after an infection traveled from his
fingertip up his throwing arm, all the way to his shoulder, and began
spreading into his body.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't realize it was that serious until I went to the
hospital," Ashby said. "They gave me antibiotics, and I was fine.
This one isn't that bad. The main thing is to let it heal a bit. I
don't want to be in the same boat I was in back in 2000."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii, who suffered a fractured skull when
he was hit in the head by a line drive Sunday, remained hospitalized
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Tuesday, but Manager Jim Tracy said
he felt well enough to go outside and take a walk. "He's made some
major strides," Tracy said.... The Dodgers are considering recalling
knuckleballer Dennis Springer from triple-A Las Vegas for Friday
night's game against the Rockies but will probably use a
bullpen-by-committee approach, with either Giovanni Carrara or Kevin
Beirne starting.</TE>

<LD>Colorado wide receiver-kick returner Jeremy Bloom's status for
Saturday's game against USC is in doubt because of a broken big left
toe.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Gary Barnett called Bloom "very doubtful," although Bloom
plans to try to practice today.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a chance he could play, but I think it's going to depend
on how much progress he makes in the next day.... In all likelihood,
we won't have him," Barnett said.</LD>
<TE>   Bloom, who returned a punt 75 yards for a touchdown in the
Buffaloes' opener against Colorado State and set up another score
with a 31-yard return last week against San Diego State, was injured
when he was tripped on his last punt return against the Aztecs.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett says concussion-plagued quarterback Craig Ochs likely will
miss games against USC and UCLA but will be cleared to play in the
Oct. 5 game against Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Ochs underwent four hours of neurological examinations on Monday
and had further tests on Tuesday. Senior Robert Hodge will start at
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utah running back Marty Johnson, the nation's leading rusher, will
miss four to six weeks because of a sprained right knee. Johnson, a
senior, is averaging 202.5 rushing yards through two games. J.R.
Peroulis will take over as the starting tailback Saturday against
Arizona.... Miami receiver Andre Johnson will miss Saturday's game at
Temple after having surgery on his left shoulder. Johnson, who leads
the team with seven catches for 100 yards and two touchdowns, had
surgery to remove loose particles. He is expected back for the Sept.
21 game against Boston College.... Hawaii running back Jonathan
Kauka, who tore ligaments in his right knee Friday against Brigham
Young, will miss the remainder of the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A jersey number randomly assigned to a Pittsburgh walk-on center
may have cost the Panthers a possible victory Saturday over No. 21
Texas A&amp;M. Coach Walt Harris said long snapper Jonathan Sitter's No.
91 resulted in the Panthers twice being flagged for illegal shift
penalties on extra-point attempts after their first touchdown in a
14-12 loss.</TE>
<TE>   In the Panthers' swinging-gate formation, Sitter needed to be
wearing a number between 50 and 79.</TE>
<TE>   The misses forced the Panthers to attempt a two-point conversion
after their final touchdown.</TE>

<HD>It Wouldn't Be Boxing Without Some Fighting Words</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Boxing promoter Bob Arum was in an L.A. restaurant recently with one
of his Top Rank publicists, Bozo Caplan, and a couple of newspaper
guys when Caplan began trying to earn his lunch.</LD>
<LD>   "This was one of the hardest fights to put together in history,
wasn't it Bob?" he said, referring to Saturday night's bout at the
Mandalay Bay Events Center between Oscar De La Hoya and Fernando
Vargas. "Tell 'em, Bob. Tell 'em how hard it was to put together."</LD>
<LD>   "It wasn't hard at all," Arum said.</LD>
<TE>   You wouldn't think it would be. It has seemed like an inevitable
match since early 2000, when De La Hoya met Derrell Coley at Madison
Square Garden. Vargas, who was on the undercard, started talking
trash beforehand about De La Hoya. Vargas said he couldn't wait to
fight De La Hoya. De La Hoya said that he would never give Vargas a
fight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's when you knew it was going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   These fighters truly dislike each other. How could they not? They
are too much alike.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas likes to present himself as the street guy and De La Hoya
as the yuppie. De La Hoya does nothing to make anyone argue with that
assessment.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference here Tuesday, Vargas slouched in his seat,
chewing gum and wearing a baseball cap with the brim pulled down to
his brooding eyes. De La Hoya sat tall and straight, his strong chin
pointed upward the way they teach in etiquette classes.</TE>
<TE>   But they have more in common than they have differences. Both are
Mexican Americans who were born in Southern California, De La Hoya in
East L.A. and Vargas in Oxnard. De La Hoya was the best fighter on
the U.S. Olympic team in 1992 and won a gold medal. Vargas was the
best fighter on the U.S. Olympic team in '96, although he didn't win
a gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Neither is as good as Felix Trinidad Jr., who has beaten both.
Both are good enough to have beaten Ike Quartey, who is very good. De
La Hoya is a boxer who, with the notable exception of his loss to
Trinidad, can be drawn into a brawl. Vargas likes to brawl but is
smart enough to know he is more effective when boxing.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya is not as smooth as he likes people to think he is.
Vargas is not as rough as he likes people to think he is. Both have
vices. De La Hoya has been in more trouble. Vargas has been in worse
trouble. Both contribute to charities.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they had to fight each other.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The only question was when.</TE>
<TE>   The bout was originally scheduled for May 4, until De La Hoya's
left wrist, which had previously required surgery, was re-injured.
That's his story. Vargas' story is that De La Hoya simply wasn't in
shape to fight him then. In any case, that would have been a more
appropriate date for a fight promoted as "Bad Blood."</TE>
<TE>   In one small concession to Sept. 11, the major news conference,
normally scheduled for the Wednesday before a Saturday night fight,
was moved to Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Arum thanked the media for coming a day early, recognizing the
sacrifice that sportswriters were making by spending an extra day in
Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure why anyone believes changing the date is more
respectful. There is no formal news conference scheduled here today,
but the stories of the news conference are appearing in newspapers
today, and there was no shortage of references to war and warriors
and "explosive" this and "explosive" that.</TE>
<TE>   That's boxing. That's life. Vargas and his entourage honored the
anniversary by wearing "FDNY" and "NYPD" caps. It was a nice touch.
De La Hoya and his entourage should have thought of it. Their caps
read, "Everlast."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The last time before Tuesday that Fernando "Ferocious" Vargas and
Oscar "He Hate Me" De La Hoya had been in the same room together was
for a news conference in January at the Biltmore in downtown L.A.
They went nose to nose, then Vargas shoved De La Hoya, starting a
melee. The fighters were uninjured, but a photographer broke his leg.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, two plexiglass walls were placed between the two
fighters and their entourages on the stage here Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   That was stolen from Don King's repertoire. It was how he
separated Bernard Hopkins and Trinidad before their fight. He said it
was required because of their animosity toward each other, but,
winking, confided, "It's all bull."</TE>
<TE>   Considering their history, De La Hoya said he didn't think this
was all hype.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel embarrassed," he said when asked about the plexiglass.
"But this is what Vargas brings to the table."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, neither Vargas nor De La Hoya brought much to the table
Tuesday other than good manners.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 14, you will see a good show from both of us," De La Hoya
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was left to their handlers to provide the bull.</TE>
<TE>   A la Muhammad Ali, De La Hoya's trainer, Floyd Mayweather Sr.,
read a poem he composed to fight off the boredom at their Big Bear
training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Exactly this way, the fight will happen.</TE>
<TE>   "Round one has just begun. We want to dance and prance and have a
little fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Round two, Vargas is nearly through.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got two black eyes because of you.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't hit what your eyes can't see.</TE>
<TE>   "If you keep talking, we'll end it in three."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas' co-manager, Rolando Arellano, and trainer, Eduardo Garcia,
fired back.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep the ... from Floyd Mayweather's mouth from ruining my
Italian suit," Arellano said.</TE>
<TE>   "Kmart suit," Mayweather said.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't that the way it usually is? The guys who are the most worked
up are the ones who don't have to dodge each other's punches on
Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Currin Out to End Run by Baffert</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer and co-owner of Outta Here says extra
distance will benefit maiden in Del Mar Futurity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>A maiden hasn't won the Del Mar Futurity since Go West Young Man at
70-1 in 1977. William Currin will try to win today's 55th running of
the stake with a non-winner, and under the most difficult conditions.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest roadblocks figure to be the five 2-year-olds trained
by Bob Baffert, who, in absentia, will be trying to win Del Mar's
closing-day stake for the seventh consecutive year.</LD>
<LD>   Outta Here ran well against two of Baffert's juveniles, finishing
third behind Kafwain and Chief Planner in the Best Pal Stakes here
Aug. 21, but jockey Kent Desormeaux has to figure out how his mount
can make up the two lengths Kafwain won by at 6 1/2 furlongs, half a
mile shorter than the Futurity distance.</LD>
<TE>   "I think the extra distance will help my horse," said Currin, who
trains and co-owns Outta Here. "Baffert is always tough to beat, but
I think my horse is coming up good to this race."</TE>
<TE>   The $250,000 Futurity will be the fourth race for Outta Here, a
$37,000 yearling.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Best Pal, he made his debut at Hollywood Park, running
second on July 6, and was back two weeks later for a second-place
finish behind Crowned Dancer in the Hollywood Juvenile. In the Best
Pal, Outta Here closed from the back of the pack, but never
threatened Kafwain and Chief Planner, who finished a length apart.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert's streak in the Futurity began with Silver Charm in 1996,
and that win was followed by victories from Souvenir Copy, Worldly
Manner, Forest Camp, Flame Thrower and Officer. Silver Charm won the
1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness, but among the other winners, the
only horse to reach the Derby was Worldly Manner, who by that time
had been sold for a reported $5 million and ran seventh at Churchill
Downs for Sheik Mohammed's trainer, Saeed bin Suroor.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Kafwain and Chief Planner, Baffert's other starters today
are Icecoldbeeratreds, Friendly Mike and Bull Market, a son of Holy
Bull. Bull Market's only start produced a 3 1/4-length win over
maidens here on opening day. That was the first of Baffert's 16 wins
with maidens--12 of them 2-year-olds--at the meet.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert has been at Keeneland this week, looking for more young
horses. This weekend, he'll run two more of the futures for next
year's classics: Vindication in Saturday's Kentucky Cup Juvenile at
Turfway Park and Truckle Feature in Sunday's Futurity at Belmont
Park. Vindication, undefeated in two sprints here this season, is a
Seattle Slew colt who was a $2.15-million yearling purchase by his
owner, Satish Sanan's Padua Stables. All of Baffert's 2-year-olds are
pointing for the $1-million Breeders' Cup Juvenile--a race the
trainer has never won--at Arlington Park on Oct. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Barnes and Tim Yakteen, Baffert's assistants, will saddle his
quintet today.</TE>

<LD>   Contenders: Rialto Eisenhower (Citrus Belt), Long Beach Jordan

<TE>   Key dates: Sept. 20, Redlands vs. Santa Margarita at Saddleback

18, Redlands at Eisenhower, Mater Dei vs. Loyola at East L.A.

Santa Margarita vs. Mater Dei at Cal State Fullerton; Nov. 14, Edison
vs. Los Alamitos at Long Beach Veterans Stadium; Nov. 15, Poly at
Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   The scoop: Early indications are that Poly and Edison, last year's
playoff finalists, may not be as strong this season. Several coaches
seem to think Poly has lost its aura of invincibility in the wake of
graduating such standouts as running back Hershel Dennis and tight
end Marcedes Lewis. Edison lost its season opener to Honolulu Iolani,
which isn't considered one of the Hawaiian prep powers. Los Alamitos
could contend for its first section title since it won Division II in
1993.</TE>

vs. Hart at College of the Canyons; Sept. 27, Long Beach Jordan vs.
Ayala at Chino High; Oct. 4, Redlands vs. Rancho Cucamonga at Chaffey
College, Valencia at Arroyo Grande; Oct. 18, Upland vs. Rancho
Cucamonga at Chaffey College; Oct. 25, San Clemente at Mission Viejo;
Nov. 1, Ayala at Chino; Nov. 14, Valencia vs. Hart at College of the
Canyons.</TE>
<TE>   The scoop: This should be little more than a four-horse race
loaded with also-rans. Hart and Valencia, last year's Division III
finalists, are legitimate title contenders after moving up a division
but will have to contend with Mission Viejo and Chino, which feature
powerhouse running games. Hart and Mission Viejo may establish
themselves as early favorites with victories over Los Alamitos and
Mater Dei, respectively, in the first two weeks of the season.</TE>

<TE>   The scoop: With four-time champion Hart and the Foothill League
moved to Division II, the Bay and Pacific leagues should produce the
dominant teams. Mira Costa has been a division semifinalist and
finalist the last two seasons behind Michael Okwo, a powerful runner
and standout linebacker. With an improved passing game courtesy of
quarterback Peter Dobush, Mira Costa is the team to beat in the Bay
League. Muir has transfer Richard Irvin to fill the spot vacated by
quarterback Ryan O'Hara (Arizona). St. Paul drops down from Division
I and is a slight favorite in the Mission League. Dominguez features
quarterback/defensive back Anthony Wheat.</TE>

Oxnard at Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   The scoop: St. Bonaventure makes the jump from Division XI to IV
this season, but the Seraphs and wide receiver Whitney Lewis, one of
the top recruits in the nation, are still expected to contend for
their fourth consecutive section title. Arroyo Grande is ranked No. 1
in the Southern Section's preseason division poll, but the Eagles
will be a junior-dominated team this season. Safety Chad Simonson
will start for the fourth season. Santa Monica will return six
defensive starters from a team that won the Division X title last
year. Oxnard has 10 returning starters on offense and seven on
defense.</TE>

<TE>   The scoop: After winning the division title last season, North has
upgraded its schedule to include Mater Dei and Eisenhower. The
Huskies return 14 starters, including last season's sophomore state
player of the year, receiver/defensive back Damon Morton. Centennial
has won 23 of its last 25 games and will feature a defense led by
linebackers Brett Martin (110 tackles last season) and Ryan Phipps
(80 tackles) and defensive lineman Jeff Banjamin (7 1/2 sacks). Kevin
Thurston, an All-San Andreas League receiver who caught 10 touchdown
passes for Cajon, will switch to quarterback. Murrieta Valley looks
to be the team to beat in the Southwestern League, returning eight
defensive starters.</TE>

<HD>Serra League Adds Pair to Power Cast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The high school football equivalent of "Survivor" will debut Oct. 18,
featuring several new twists.</LD>
<LD>   The cast members are already intimately acquainted and are willing
to knock each other off week after week in pursuit of the prize: a
Serra League title.</LD>
<LD>   You'll have to excuse Los Angeles Loyola, Santa Margarita, Santa
Ana Mater Dei, La Puente Bishop Amat, Anaheim Servite and Bellflower
St. John Bosco if they skip the initial pleasantries in favor of
pummeling one another from the opening kickoff of league play. It's
what they do.</LD>
<TE>   "It's really going to be a rock-'em, sock-'em league," Loyola
Coach Steve Grady said. "From top to bottom, all the teams are good."</TE>
<TE>   The six-team Serra League, which includes four holdovers plus new
members Loyola and Bishop Amat from the Del Rey League, could produce
a champion worthy of pushing Long Beach Poly in the race for the
Southern Section Division I title. Three Serra teams are in The
Times' preseason rankings: No. 3 Loyola, No. 7 Mater Dei and No. 9
Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Amat and Servite, though unranked, are traditional powers,
and St. John Bosco is considered an up-and-coming program, though it
lost its opener on Friday, 33-7, to Miami Monsignor Pace.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of things could happen to members of the new and improved
Serra League, which supplants the Sunset as the toughest league in
Division I. Either the winner of the league title will be so
battle-tested it will zip through the playoffs, or it will be so worn
down from injuries and the emotional roller-coaster ride of league
play that it will be susceptible to an early exit from postseason
play.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei got a taste last season of things to come when it played
Bishop Amat in a nonleague game. Monarch quarterback Jason Forcier
broke an ankle and was lost for the season, running back Nathan Coash
hurt his shoulder and receiver Julian Petit suffered a bruised spleen
that required hospitalization. Several Bishop Amat players also were
injured.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes, whose Griffins play in the Sunset
League, knows what it's like to face a tough league opponent every
week. Five Sunset teams have battled each other for league supremacy
for years. Only Huntington Beach has not been competitive recently.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose whoever wins [the Serra League], if they're healthy,
will be in good shape," Barnes said. "I would think playing in that
league would help them."</TE>
<TE>   Loyola, Santa Margarita and Mater Dei are expected to vie for the
league title. Loyola's Grady said he favors Santa Margarita, which
has won the last two Serra titles but hasn't progressed past the
quarterfinals of the playoffs in its three seasons in Division I.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita, which lost to Los Alamitos in the quarterfinals
last season, should be formidable if senior running back Ashton White
is able to return to top form; otherwise it may fall into the Serra's
second division.</TE>
<TE>   White, the reigning league most valuable player, suffered an
off-season knee injury but returned to full-contact drills Monday and
is expected to start in the Eagles' opener Thursday against Orange El
Modena.</TE>
<TE>   Known more for its defense, Loyola may go on the offensive this
year behind senior quarterback Adam Gonzalez and senior running back
Bo Renaud. Gonzalez threw for 1,444 yards and 11 touchdowns and
rushed for 364 yards and five touchdowns last season. Renaud rushed
for 1,092 yards and 14 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs return only three starters on defense, none along the
line. The most noticeable absentee will be speedster Quintin Daniels,
a standout at defensive back and receiver who averaged nearly 20
yards every time he touched the ball. Daniels has been out since
April with a hamstring injury, and Grady said he has no timetable for
the senior's return.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei will use a two-quarterback system for the first time
since 1999, but neither player is likely to be as talented as Matt
Grootegoed or Matt Leinart, who have moved on to USC. Neither Jessie
Mier, a senior who will start, nor Forcier, a sophomore whose broken
ankle caused him to miss much of last season, has much game
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Monarch Coach Bruce Rollinson hopes senior running back Rafael
Rice, who did not have the big season many expected last year after
transferring from Loyola, can carry the offensive load. Rollinson
attributed much of Rice's ineffectiveness to a hairline fracture he
suffered in his right foot midway through the season but said he is
heading into this season at full strength.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Newhall Hart Coach Mike Herrington said he isn't convinced that
the Indians' string of four consecutive section titles is in jeopardy
simply because they have moved from Division III to Division II.</TE>
<TE>   Herrington said he thinks Divisions II, III and IV are "all about
equal among the top teams."</TE>
<TE>   "In Division II, there might be a few second-and third-place teams
[from leagues] that are a little more high quality," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Herrington did acknowledge that Hart needs to worry about winning
the Foothill League title before focusing on another section title.
The Indians have a new quarterback in Sean Norton and are
inexperienced at several other key positions.</TE>
<TE>   Many Foothill League coaches have picked Valencia, which features
standout running back Charles Burnley, to end Hart's 53-game league
winning streak when the teams play Nov. 14 at College of the Canyons.
Hart is 8-0 all-time against Valencia.</TE>

<KH>FALL PREVIEW: BOYS' WATER POLO</KH>
<HD>Wilson Team Is Water Tight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Members of the Long Beach Wilson boys' water polo team traveled to
Mexico last weekend, intent on tightening the knot that has bonded
many of them for nearly 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   For three days, they surfed and held impromptu meetings around the
pool and in their condominium rooms, centering nearly every
conversation on the longtime camaraderie they've enjoyed as teammates
at Wilson and on their Long Beach Shore club team.</LD>
<LD>   "We talked about how close we are," said Matt Norris, one of six
returning senior starters for the Bruins. "About how it's the last
time we'll be playing together, and how it means a lot to play every
game like it's our last."</LD>
<TE>   In the last game they played together, Wilson won a Southern
Section championship. With their starting lineup returning nearly
intact, as well as many talented reserves, the Bruins are again the
team to beat this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We know everybody wants to take us down," said senior Thomas
Hale, who spent most of the summer playing for the U.S. junior
national team.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the case last season, when Wilson hovered around the
middle of The Times' top 10 rankings before getting hot in the
playoffs and winning their fifth Division I title in six years.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Tony Martinho, who, as a player, helped Wilson win its first
championship in 1981, agreed the Bruins will be the favorites this
fall.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is different this season," Martinho said. "Last
year, we thought we had something to prove and we worked very hard
for that."</TE>
<TE>   Familiarity breeds success. Knowledge of each other's styles and
abilities allows the players to pass with better efficiency, knowing
exactly where each wants to receive the ball in order to get off the
quickest shot. On defense, they usually don't have to shout for help
because they know it's already there.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know each other's moves and how we play," said senior
Garrit Barth, a returning starter. "We know we can rely on each
other."</TE>
<TE>   Hale is Wilson's top player and the team's only four-year starter.
In addition to his time on the junior national team, which included
playing in a tournament in Russia this summer, he played two years on
the U.S. youth team. He is also left-handed, which makes him a hot
commodity on any level.</TE>
<TE>   "He controls our offense," Norris said. "Plus, he spent the whole
summer playing with college guys, so they've really helped him out."</TE>
<TE>   Norris specializes in two-meter defense, which usually requires
guarding the opposition's biggest and best player.</TE>
<TE>   He played one of his better games of the season in last year's
Division I final, holding The Times' player of the year, Marty
Matthies of North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake, to three goals in a 9-7
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers John Foster and Clint Wilson are also members of the U.S.
youth team. Foster handles most of the Bruins' two-meter offense, and
Wilson who is also left-handed, plays on the same side of the pool as
Hale.</TE>
<TE>   At 6-foot-4, Barth, a dangerous perimeter shooter, is the team's
tallest player and also its fastest swimmer. Brent LaBounty returns
as goalkeeper.</TE>
<TE>   "We all have our specialties and it works out good," Norris said.
"We're a real balanced team."</TE>

<TE>   THE TIMES' RANKINGS</TE>
<TE>   A preseason look at the top 10 boys' water polo teams in the
Southland:</TE>
<TE>   1. L.B. Wilson (SS-Division I)</TE>
<TE>   Six returning starters from last year's Division I championship
team include U.S. junior national team member Thomas Hale and youth
team members John Foster and Clint Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   2. Servite (SS-Division II)</TE>
<TE>   U.S. junior team member Trevor Clark is surrounded by talent,
including senior Pat Buckner and junior Adam Hewko.</TE>
<TE>   3. Corona del Mar (SS-Division I)</TE>
<TE>   Division II co-most valuable player Artie Dorr and U.S. junior
team member John Mann are among region's best players and their size
will create headaches for opposing defenses. The Sea Kings were
Division II champions last year.</TE>
<TE>   4. Harvard-Westlake (SS-Division I)</TE>
<TE>   Marty Matthies, the 2001 Division I player of the year, will get
help from a strong group of freshmen. Typically, one of the more
physical teams.</TE>
<TE>   5. El Toro (SS-Division I)</TE>
<TE>   All-South Coast League players Matt Grace and Brent Danna lead a
group of four returning varsity players who helped Chargers advance
to Division I semifinals last year.</TE>
<TE>   6. Newport Harbor (SS-Division I)</TE>
<TE>   Seniors Nathan Weiner and Ross Sinclair and junior Michael Bury
return for their second-year coach, Jason Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   7. Foothill (SS-Division I)</TE>
<TE>   Alex Cripe and Frank Reynolds will be counted on offensively,
while Sandy Hohener will take over in goal. Knights will be pressed
against more physical teams.</TE>
<TE>   8. San Clemente (SS-Division I)</TE>
<TE>   Led by Kenny Yamamoto, Tritons don't lose much from team that lost
to Wilson in the Division I semifinals last year.</TE>
<TE>   9. Riverside Poly (SS-Division V)</TE>
<TE>   Not as deep as last season's Division V championship team, but
All-American Mike Looy is one of the region's best two-meter players.</TE>
<TE>   10. Villa Park (SS-Division II)</TE>
<TE>   Former Spartan standout Joey Pacelli takes over a strong group,
including Servite transfer Shea Buckner. Villa Park drops to Division
II this season.</TE>

<LD>So much for small ball.</LD>
<LD>   Last season was one for the small schools, a surprising number of
them rising up to defeat their counterparts with the 2,000-plus
student enrollments and sprawling campuses.</LD>
<LD>   It was a clip-and-save bonanza for the tiny tots: L.A. Marymount
finished No. 1 in The Times' final girls' volleyball rankings, North
Hollywood Harvard-Westlake was No. 5 and Lakewood St. Joseph was No.
10.</LD>
<TE>   But bigger is back this season, and in a big way.</TE>
<TE>   Of last year's small-school successes, only Marymount, with an
enrollment of 395, appears in The Times' preseason rankings, at No.
3.</TE>
<TE>   The Sailors will be joined by Long Beach Wilson (4,400 students),
Manhattan Beach Mira Costa (2,400), Los Alamitos (2,800) and Anaheim
Esperanza (3,000) as the top teams in the region this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the only small school, really," Marymount Coach Cari Klein
said. With one exception: Torrance Bishop Montgomery is ranked No. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, with outside hitters Cynthia Barboza, a 6-foot sophomore,
and Emily Hendrickson, a 5-11 senior, could have the best team in
school history.</TE>
<TE>   Sydney Donahue, a 5-foot-8 junior, can pound the ball at outside
hitter for Mira Costa, which won the Iolani tournament in Hawaii last
month after losing to Harvard-Westlake in the tournament championship
the two previous years.</TE>
<TE>   "It runs in cycles," Mira Costa Coach DaeLea Aldrich said. "There
will be some down years [for big schools]."</TE>
<TE>   The list of giants goes on: Long Beach Poly (4,500), Newport
Harbor (2,290), Santa Ana Mater Dei (2,080) and Capistrano Valley
(2,825) round out The Times' rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "There seems to be a lot of us up there this time," Wilson Coach
Susan Pescar said. "It shows it's kind of moving around a little bit.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the [small-school] programs, a lot of those people
play club. Then their friends from club come and they all play high
school together. Suddenly, it turns into a really good team. Then it
goes through a cycle of winning. Then they have to rebuild. It's a
cycle thing."</TE>
<TE>   Marymount, a secluded all-girls' school at the base of the Bel-Air
Country Club, won the state Division IV title last season.</TE>
<TE>   With setter/outside hitter Haley Jorgensborg leading the way,
Marymount defeated Mira Costa and San Clemente at the Torrey Pines
tournament last October and nearly upset eventual state Division I
champion Torrey Pines in the tournament championship.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, Marymount met Harvard-Westlake in a nonleague
match that marked one of the finest hours for small-school volleyball
in Los Angeles: Marymount, No. 3 in The Times' rankings at the time,
defeated No. 2 Harvard-Westlake in four games, took over the top spot
and never relinquished its ranking, losing only one game in eight
playoff matches.</TE>
<TE>   Jorgensborg is at UCLA, but the return of senior middle blockers
Virginia Levannas and Liz Cvitan makes the Sailors overwhelming
favorites to win a third consecutive state Division IV championship.</TE>

<TE>   THE TIMES' RANKINGS</TE>
<TE>   A preseason look at the top 10 girls' volleyball teams in the
Southland:</TE>
<TE>   1. L.B. Wilson (25-8 last year, SS-Div. I-AA)</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore outside hitter Cynthia Barboza is stellar, as is
surrounding talent.</TE>
<TE>   2. Mira Costa (31-6, SS-Div. I-A)</TE>
<TE>   Young but good; junior outside hitter Sydney Donahue and freshman
setter Taylor Carico are worth watching.</TE>
<TE>   3. Marymount (34-4, SS-Div. IV-AA)</TE>
<TE>   Can small-school Sailors again navigate way through large-school
opponents?</TE>
<TE>   4. Los Alamitos (14-4, SS-Div. I-AA)</TE>
<TE>   Setter Ashley Tarutis, an All-Southern Section selection last
season as a sophomore, runs a well-rounded offense.</TE>
<TE>   5. Esperanza (21-4, SS-Div. I-AA)</TE>
<TE>   Now and later: Senior Dyanne Lawlor has committed to Long Beach
State; 6-2 freshman Ashley Engle will be a four-year fixture.</TE>
<TE>   6. Newport Harbor (22-11, SS-Div. II-AA)</TE>
<TE>   Middle blocker Kristin McClune will go to Pepperdine; Sailors will
go as far as she carries them.</TE>
<TE>   7. Long Beach Poly (26-5, SS-Div. I-AA)</TE>
<TE>   Outside hitter Cynthia Buggs will be bothering and, yes, bugging
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   8. Mater Dei (33-4, SS-Div. II-A)</TE>
<TE>   Not quite the potent attack of a year ago, but Monarchs won't be
dethroned quietly.</TE>
<TE>   9. Bishop Montgomery (20-8, SS-Div. III-A)</TE>
<TE>   After a couple of relatively quiet years, Knights are back in
Division III state title hunt.</TE>
<TE>   10. Capistrano Valley (11-6, SS-Div. I-A)</TE>
<TE>   Brandy Magee, a 6-2 middle blocker who has committed to Texas,
ensures the Cougars of a strong season.</TE>

<LD>Closing day at Del Mar offers four turf races and local fans are
advised to enjoy them because there won't be any more until Oak Tree
begins on Oct. 2.</LD>
<LD>   One of the grass races this afternoon is a minor stakes, the
$75,000 Live The Dream Handicap at one mile.</LD>
<LD>   The horse to beat is Zanapour, a 4-year-old gelding trained by
Julio Canani for owner Michael House. Winless in his first five
starts in this country after arriving from France, he has won two in
a row on the Del Mar turf.</LD>
<TE>   Race of the day: Palmarola, impressive in her California debut for
trainer Richard Mandella on June 9 at Hollywood Park, runs in the
third, the 11th running of the $70,000 California Equine Retirement
Foundation Handicap at six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Mario Pino. The jockey became the 18th rider to reach
5,000 victories when he won Sunday's ninth at Delaware Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Bella Bellucci. Anybody else tired of all the excuses
made for this filly when she loses? Still perceived by some as the
best 3-year-old filly in the country, she failed again in Grade I
company, running third in Saturday's Gazelle at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta in the 10th using Petit Marquis,
Beautiful Balance and Ice Prince in the first two spots and all in
the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/89. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $17/$527.40. Total money bet: $720.</TE>

<LD>Bob Chichester worked at the highest level of intercollegiate
athletics at Colorado. UC Irvine hired him to take its program to
another level.</LD>
<LD>   Chichester, 45, was introduced as the sixth athletic director in
school history Tuesday after spending three years as senior associate
athletic director at Colorado, where he administered the program's 14
nonrevenue sports.</LD>
<LD>   Chichester will begin his duties Oct. 14.</LD>
<TE>   The former Pasadena Poly High and Occidental College basketball
player was hired after a five-month search to replace Dan Guerrero,
who left after 9 1/2 years to become athletic director at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   As the top assistant to Colorado Athletic Director Dick Tharp,
Chichester worked in a program that had a budget of $29 million.
Irvine's total budget is comparable to the nearly $8 million spent
only on football.</TE>
<TE>   "At Colorado, we worried about keeping pace with the other Big 12
schools," he said. "There's some difference in the level of
competition that Colorado is involved in. But I think that an
individual here can compete with other schools that are not only in
our region but across the country."</TE>

<HD>Shaq to Have Surgery Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal will have surgery today, nearly three months since
the last game of the Laker three-peat, three weeks before the start
of training camp.</LD>
<LD>   Delayed by conflicting medical opinions and the hesitation they
inflicted, O'Neal will have 47 days to recover if he is to be healthy
for the regular season, his 10th in the NBA and seventh with the
Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Robert Mohr, chief of podiatric surgery at UCLA Medical
Center, will attempt to relieve the pain in O'Neal's arthritic right
big toe with a short, early-morning procedure called a "cheilectomy,"
in which the bone around the joint is carved away.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're anxious about [today's surgery]," Laker General
Manager Mitch Kupchak said Tuesday. "We're confident with the doctor
and the procedure. It was unfortunate he got ill a month ago, but
we're comfortable with the prognosis."</TE>
<TE>   The recovery, Kupchak said he was told, "could be anywhere from
six to eight to 10 weeks, a normal recovery without complications.
But we'll know more [today]."</TE>
<TE>   As a precaution, the Lakers have invited veteran centers Ike
Austin and Duane Causwell to a two-day tryout camp beginning today in
El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't anticipate Shaquille participating in training camp,"
Kupchak said.</TE>
<TE>   Guards Jeff Trepagnier (USC) and Mitchell Butler (UCLA) also will
compete for the next two days for a chance to come to training camp,
with about a dozen others.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While Kobe Bryant mulls a fourth consecutive championship and a
new shoe--Nike and Reebok have made the hardest pushes for what
should be a massive endorsement deal since Bryant dropped Adidas
earlier this summer--the Lakers' standing offer of a three-year
contract extension remains untouched.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant has neither declined nor accepted an offer of three years
for nearly $55 million--the maximum allowed by the collective
bargaining agreement--that would kick in after the 2004-05 season.</TE>
<TE>   The complication: Bryant can opt out of his contract in two years,
or after the 2003-04 season, which is when the CBA expires. Bryant
may choose to examine the terms of the next labor deal before
agreeing to terms under the current one.</TE>
<TE>   NBA owners, however, have the option to extend the agreement
through the 2004-05 season, at which point Bryant could wait the
additional year and decide then.</TE>
<TE>   Or, Bryant, who turned 24 on Aug. 23 and who even in his darkest
moments in Los Angeles never talked about leaving the Lakers, could
take the deal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Murray, acquired in the draft-day deal with the Toronto
Raptors, is recovering well from April hip surgery. He has worked out
at the Laker training facility, and the club expects him to be
healthy for training camp, which begins Oct. 1.... Bryant, Murray,
Derek Fisher, Mark Madsen, Kareem Rush and Rick Fox, among others,
already are on the floor in El Segundo.... Coach Phil Jackson drove
in from Montana late last week.</TE>

<HD>Federal Agencies Boosted Probe</HD>
<DH>Jurisprudence: NCAA's investigation into Martin, Webber
case had stalled until authorities became involved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wee hours of a February morning in 1996, an expensive SUV
driven by Michigan basketball player Maurice Taylor, and carrying
teammates and a top recruit, rolled over on the way home from a night
of partying in Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   The most serious injury was a broken arm.</LD>
<LD>   Six years later, because of questions that accident prompted,
Sacramento King star Chris Webber--already three years into his NBA
career at the time and nowhere near the scene--faces federal perjury
charges as Michigan awaits penalties in what appears to be the
biggest-dollar infraction case in NCAA history.</LD>
<TE>   Had that vehicle never rolled, questions about why Taylor was
driving such a lavish vehicle might never have led to Ed Martin, a
self-styled booster who was discovered to have been running an
illegal lottery ring and funneling money to Detroit players since
Webber was in high school.</TE>
<TE>   The case is a study in the haphazard manner in which NCAA
violations sometimes come to light--and testimony to the solemn force
a criminal probe lends to university and NCAA investigations that are
often toothless because they lack subpoena power and the threat of
perjury prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Not until the money trail led to Martin, who tried to launder
proceeds from the illegal lottery at a Ford Motor Co. plant via
"loans" to high school and college players, did federal investigators
become involved, adding heft to an investigation that had proved
little.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, the IRS and the Organized Crime Strike Force Unit of the
U.S. Attorney's office in Detroit combined on a probe that has led to
guilty pleas by 15 defendants, among them Martin--"Uncle Eddie" to a
generation of young Detroit players.</TE>
<TE>   Though basketball was only a small part of the story, the alleged
payments by Martin to four players and their families before and
during the players' time at Michigan amount to a staggering $616,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Law enforcement brings the power of subpoenas and the ability to
require witnesses to offer complete and truthful information," said
David Price, the NCAA vice president for enforcement, who would not
discuss the Michigan case, citing policy, but addressed questions
about NCAA investigative procedures.</TE>
<TE>   "It would make an enormous difference if we were able to require
people to talk to us. Very rarely do we get former student-athletes
in the public arena to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't try to fantasize or believe we would get the kind of
legal tools such as subpoena power. This is a college association of
institutions of higher education. I don't think colleges would want
to use those kinds of powers."</TE>
<TE>   Until federal authorities stepped in, investigations by Michigan,
the NCAA and an outside law firm hired by the university were met by
denials and resistance and proved only minor violations--some as
simple as Martin's giving a player a cake or appearing at a recruit's
home with then-coach Steve Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   The federal grand jury investigating the illegal lottery was able
to compel more complete testimony--including admissions by former
Michigan players Robert Traylor--the one who broke his arm in the
accident--and Louis Bullock that they had received substantial loans
from Martin.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't lie to the grand jury," Steve Fishman, an attorney
who represents Traylor and Bullock told the Detroit News in August.
"They didn't commit any crime. They may have committed an NCAA
violation, but they have nothing to worry about."</TE>
<TE>   Webber, however, has insisted he received smaller amounts of money
but nowhere near the $280,000 federal authorities allege.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not lie to the grand jury," Webber told reporters in a
statement he read Tuesday after a workout in Sacramento. "This case
is about a man who befriended kids like myself, preying on our
naivete, our innocence, claiming that he loved us and wanted to
support us, but later wanting to cash in on that love and support
that we thought was free."</TE>
<TE>   (There are no allegations, nor is there evidence, that Ed Martin
ever sought to influence players to alter the outcome of Michigan
games.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, the large amounts of money funneled to players leave
Michigan facing penalties for major infractions more than a decade
after Webber arrived at Michigan as the centerpiece of the "Fab Five"
recruiting class.</TE>
<TE>   Add to the indignity that the current athletic director, named to
the post after the violations occurred, shares his last name with
Martin, the booster who operated the illegal lottery.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me tell you, in the last month, I have been introduced for
two speeches as, 'And now we present, I'd like you to welcome the
athletic director at the University of Michigan, Ed Martin,' "
Athletic Director Bill Martin said. "The first one, I thought it was
funny. The second, I got a little irate."</TE>
<TE>   Michigan, with a historically clean athletic program, is
cooperating with the NCAA in order to speed a resolution and perhaps
mitigate the penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "This period in Michigan's basketball history goes back three
coaches, three athletic directors, three, maybe four presidents,"
Bill Martin said. "So the big thing we want to do is get it behind
us."</TE>
<TE>   A decision on penalties could be made by the end of the academic
year. The case could go before the NCAA committee on infractions in
early 2003, with a decision to follow in six to eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   It is not an easy case.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA rules call for major violations to be punished by two years
of probation, recruiting limitations, possible postseason bans and
the forfeiture of games involving ineligible players--a policy that
could strip Michigan of its 1992 and '93 Final Four appearances and
result in significant financial penalties.</TE>
<TE>   An argument could be made that Michigan is being subjected to
double jeopardy because the NCAA accepted a 1997 report by an outside
law firm that found no major violations--or that with all the
principals in the case long-since gone from Michigan, the statute of
limitations should have expired.</TE>
<TE>   But the NCAA's four-year statute of limitations nevertheless
covers the infractions because the violations were alleged to have
continued into 1999, Bullock's final year at Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the NCAA has a history of going easy on schools that have
cooperated, particularly in cases where the key figures are no longer
there. (Fisher, now at San Diego State, was fired in 1997 after an
investigation questioned his role in arranging complimentary tickets
for Ed Martin but has said he was unaware of any payments to
players.)</TE>
<TE>   "The committee has and often does back down, based on mitigating
circumstances," the NCAA's Price said.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, however, the message and the precedent of a light
sentence could be damning, given the amount of money involved.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, everybody has said, 'Fall on your sword now,' do A, B, C,
D," Bill Martin said. "We're not resigned to anything at this time.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the difficulties here is, we have a nontraditional
booster," he added, noting that Ed Martin is not a Michigan alumnus
and that he befriended young players who went on to other schools as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "I recall reading articles about him pulling up in his gold
Mercedes with a long fur coat, pulling a pair of basketball shoes out
of the trunk of his car to give to some kid on a high school or
junior high playground.</TE>
<TE>   "We have events that happened, what, eight, nine years ago. The
kids that are currently playing on this team were in junior high
school at that time."</TE>
<TE>   Michigan's best argument might be to try to get credit for time
already served--"de facto probation," Bill Martin called it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at this program since the early '90s, it has truly
suffered," he said. "Suffered in terms of performance on the court,
in terms of performance off the court, in terms of attendance,
interest. It's really been a real challenge for us."</TE>
<TE>   The final challenge will be the one faced by the current coach,
Tommy Amaker, and his players, for the excesses of years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Tommy's a very tough guy," Bill Martin said. "We discussed this
during the hiring process, that in fact this was here."</TE>
<TE>   And by the way, Bill Martin hopes Ann Arbor never sees another Fab
Five.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had the five best players in the country at each position
and you can recruit them and put them all on one team in one year,
should you do it, or not?</TE>
<TE>   "My answer is no, because they're not going to be there.</TE>
<TE>   "If a kid simply wants to go play basketball as a steppingstone to
the NBA, he shouldn't come to Michigan."</TE>

<HD>Time Gives Munich Citizens Perspective</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Killing of Israeli athletes is a painful memory
but not the only one they have of the 1972 Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MUNICH, Germany</DL>
<LD>The deadly hostage-taking incident at the 1972 Olympic Summer Games
left an indelible mark on this festive city's collective psyche and
has come to symbolize the start of an era in which athletes, like
political leaders, are regarded as fair game by extremists.</LD>
<LD>   But time and an ever-more-terrifying world have allowed the
disturbing memories of that savage standoff 30 years ago to fade for
many here, while the competition's highlights still burn bright.</LD>
<LD>   Today, those here old enough to remember their city's role in
playing host to the prestigious Games are more likely to recall the
record seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz than the
20-hour standoff that ensued when Palestinian gunmen seized Israeli
athletes. Captives and captors alike died in a botched firefight
meant to free the Israelis.</LD>
<TE>   "People's memories are tarnished by the tragedy, but they are not
dominated by it," says Gerhard Merk, now a senior editor at the
Abendzeitung daily, where he worked as a police reporter during the
fateful Games.</TE>
<TE>   A plaque at the 31 Connollystrasse crime scene commemorates the
fallen Israelis, and relatives and civic leaders have attended
memorials on previous anniversaries of the confrontation. This month,
during the European track and field championships that drew Israeli
participants here for the first time since the '72 Games, the
visiting athletes paid tribute to the 11 Israelis who were killed.</TE>
<TE>   The experience might be thought to put Munich off to playing host
to high-profile events for fear of another disaster. But sociologists
as well as civic boosters say the opposite is true. Eager to show
itself as a safe and hospitable venue, Munich has bid for and won the
rights to host several key sporting events, including the opening
game of the 2006 World Cup soccer series.</TE>
<TE>   Some Munich residents attribute the flagging recollections of the
'72 Games to the general turn for the worse the world has since
taken.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened in Munich bears some similarity to Sept. 11 in that
it exposed society to what until then were unimaginable excesses,"
says sociology professor Armin Nassehi. "Sport had been somewhat
protected from this, or at least there had not previously been live
media coverage bringing it into every living room."</TE>
<TE>   But shortly after the Olympics, Germany's Red Army Faction
launched a two-decade terror spree that quickly eclipsed the
Arab-Israeli conflict here. The home-grown left-wing extremists
assassinated politicians, kidnapped and killed wealthy business
leaders and hijacked airplanes in efforts to free imprisoned
comrades, until the last of the hard-core members was killed in a
1993 shootout.</TE>
<TE>   "The '72 Games haven't been a heavy psychological burden here,"
says Nassehi, "because Germans have long recognized that the world is
not a dollhouse."</TE>
<TE>   What remains painful for those old enough to remember, he adds,
was its botched culmination. "It was embarrassing that this country
that only a few years earlier had occupied and traumatized all of
Europe couldn't manage to contain five terrorists without creating a
massacre," Nassehi says.</TE>
<TE>   Said Munich Police Director Josef Strasser: "A lot of lessons were
learned then." He noted that the Olympics disaster and the Red Army
Faction attacks that followed gave rise to Germany's first post-World
War II special strike forces, known as GSG-9.</TE>
<TE>   Big crowd-drawing events have since been better protected,
Strasser adds, pointing to the millions who flock here for
Oktoberfest each autumn. The beer festival was the scene of a
September 1980 bombing that killed 10 revelers, but that attack was
determined to be the work of a single perpetrator who died in the
blast and whose motives were never fathomed.</TE>
<TE>   Security was tight for the European track events, and not only
because of the Israeli team's presence. More than 1,000 police
patrolled the athletes' quarters at the Olympic Village and barbed
wire surrounded the competition venues.</TE>
<TE>   Few here are haunted by the Olympic experience. In fact, there is
even another Olympic pitch in the planning stages, although it is a
longshot.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the good feelings about mass hospitality likely emanate
from the tangible gains brought by the last Games.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics were a good push for Munich to upgrade its transport
system and integrate rail connections with street cars and subways,"
says Beate Brennauer, spokeswoman for MVV, the city's public
transport network. "Big sports events themselves don't really bring
in any money, but they spur improvements to the whole infrastructure
that help all kinds of entertainment by making it easier for people
to get around."</TE>
<TE>   No special transport projects were necessary to get ready for
August's European track competition, but Brennauer says a subway
extension and a new street-car stop are under construction to serve a
stadium being built for the World Cup in four years.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the transport expansion inspired by the '72 Games,
Munich benefited from the 4,000 small apartments built at the Olympic
Village, which helped ease a chronic housing crunch in the city. The
municipal and state governments retained some of the units to provide
student housing for several nearby colleges, but most were sold off
as private dwellings to recoup sponsorship costs.</TE>
<TE>   "The Games are remembered as a huge success because the good
things left behind make our daily lives better," says restaurateur
Hermann Haberl, whose revolving eatery atop the Olympic site's
broadcasting tower is one of the city's favorite spots for a special
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympic Stadium now provides the home field for two of
Germany's most successful soccer clubs, the swimming hall is a
year-round hit, and the indoor arena hosts performances by the likes
of Tina Turner, the Three Tenors, the Rolling Stones and Paul
McCartney.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics left very positive memories with the people of
Munich, not to mention the wonderful park that is still very
intensively used by the public," says Peter Fischer, a construction
official with the city's Office of Urban Planning and Zoning.</TE>
<TE>   His colleague, Christiane Tahlgott, says Germans, like most
Europeans, have been forced to take in stride the ugly reality of
terrorism's omnipresent threat to their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that our security can be disrupted at any minute, that
none of us are invulnerable," she says of those living on a continent
ravaged over the last century by two world wars, the Holocaust and
the Balkan conflicts. "I think it's a little different in the United
States, that people there feel they have a natural right to security,
or at least they did until Sept. 11."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Needing another point guard after trading Andre Miller earlier this
summer, the Cleveland Cavaliers acquired Mateen Cleaves on Tuesday
from the Sacramento Kings for forward Jumaine Jones.</LD>
<LD>   After dealing Miller to the Clippers in July for forward Darius
Miles, the Cavaliers were left with Bimbo Coles as the only true
point guard on their roster.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's a perfect spot for me because Cleveland has an
energetic, young, up-and-coming team with Miles, Ricky Davis and
DaJuan Wagner and I'm hungry to show people what I can do," Cleaves
said. "I haven't felt this good since college."</LD>
<TE>   Cleaves averaged 5.4 points and 2.7 assists in 78 games as a
rookie with Detroit but was traded to Sacramento before last season
for guard Jon Barry and a future first-round draft pick.</TE>
<TE>   Cleaves got little playing time with the Kings, sitting behind
Mike Bibby and Bobby Jackson. He averaged 2.2 points in 32 games.</TE>

<TE>   The Washington Wizards signed guard Bryon Russell to a two-year
deal, ending his nine-year stay with the Utah Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Russell, 31, will start at small forward, allowing Michael Jordan
to come off the bench as a shooting guard. Russell averaged 9.6
points last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jordan was fitted with a shoe insert this week to deal with
discomfort in his surgically repaired right knee as he contemplates
whether to return for another NBA season.</TE>
<TE>   Wizard Coach Doug Collins said Jordan hoped the insert would get
his foot in better alignment and take away some of the pain on the
outside of the joint in his right knee.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Madden's debut on "Monday Night Football" was the lowest-rated
opener for the program in at least eight years.</LD>
<LD>   The New England Patriots' 30-14 victory over the Pittsburgh
Steelers on ABC on Monday drew an average rating of 12.8 and 23
share, down 3% from the 13.2/23 for last year's Monday opener, when
the Denver Broncos beat the New York Giants.</LD>
<LD>   ABC said Tuesday the rating was the lowest for a "Monday Night
Football" opener since at least 1994.</LD>
<TE>   Madden jumped to ABC from Fox in February with a $20-million,
four-year deal to join play-by-play announcer Al Michaels. "Monday
Night Football" dumped comedian Dennis Miller and analyst Dan Fouts
after two years in which ratings fell more than 15% in total.</TE>
<TE>   The number of people watching "Monday Night Football" has declined
for seven consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jacksonville punt returner Damon Gibson's fumble Sunday was
crucial in more than one way. It cost the Jaguars a touchdown in a
28-25 loss to Indianapolis, and two days later, it cost Gibson his
job.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Tom Coughlin cut the third-year player. The move was
announced in a terse news release.</TE>

<LD>Curt Schilling gave up three hits and struck out 10 in seven innings
for his major league-best 23rd victory Tuesday night to lead the
Arizona Diamondbacks over the San Diego Padres, 8-2, at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Luis Gonzalez and Matt Williams each hit two-run homers, and Steve
Finley had a solo shot as the defending World Series champions stayed
five games ahead of their nearest rival in the National League West
with 17 games to play.</LD>
<LD>   For the 15th time in his 32 starts, Schilling did not walk a
batter. He threw 92 pitches--66 strikes--and reached double digits in
strikeouts for the 13th time this season.</LD>
<TE>   Schilling (23-5) surpassed his previous career-best 22 victories
set last year, one night after teammate Randy Johnson won his 21st,
also a career-high.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 12, New York 6--The host Braves overcame a five-run
deficit behind two home runs by Andruw Jones, who homered in four
consecutive at-bats dating to Saturday's game against Montreal and
became the 11th player in NL history to accomplish the feat.</TE>
<TE>   New York starter Pedro Astacio (12-9) gave up four homers and was
ejected in the fifth inning after he plunked Gary Sheffield with a
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 8, Milwaukee 3--Eduardo Perez hit a three-run homer and
Scott Rolen had a solo shot at Milwaukee for the Cardinals, who have
won seven in a row for the first time since a nine-game streak from
Sept. 8-22, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 11, Colorado 4--Lance Berkman hit his career-high 40th
home run and had five RBIs at Houston, and the Astros won their
fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Wade Miller (13-3) won his 10th consecutive decision.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 3, Pittsburgh 0--Russell Branyan hit a solo homer to
back Danny Graves and four Red relievers, who combined on a
six-hitter at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Graves, a reliever, made his first career start and helped send
the Pirates to their 14th shutout loss.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 6, Chicago 2--Javier Vazquez (9-13) matched a season high
with 10 strikeouts at Chicago and ended a seven-game losing streak,
and Brad Wilkerson tied a Montreal rookie record with his 19th home
run.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 6-2, Philadelphia 4-1--Justin Wayne got his first major
league victory and the Marlins completed their first road
doubleheader sweep since joining the NL in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Redmond hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the seventh inning
in the first game.</TE>

<LD>   "Obviously he's exhausted and sky high in some ways after what he
did in thrilling all of us at the U.S. Open, what both he and Andre
did," McEnroe said of the Open final Sunday, which Sampras won in
four sets.</LD>
<TE>   "I think Pete needs some time to digest what happened, think about
what he wants to do, whether that means not play the rest of this
year, whether that means maybe not even play again. I think he's just
worn out. I certainly understand that."</TE>
<TE>   Another difficult call was to Mike and Bob Bryan. The Bryans, who
reached the U.S. Open semifinals in doubles, were strongly considered
but fell out of the picture, in part, because of Roddick's injured
left foot.</TE>
<TE>   "They're great guys," McEnroe said. "I think they would be great
Davis Cup players.... But the reality is it's hard to go with a
doubles team in this match especially because I do have to consider
Andy's foot, which is better, but it's certainly a concern of mine
that Andy is a hundred percent healthy. The opportunity to have
another singles player or two there I think was crucial."</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the USTA extended McEnroe's captaincy for two more
years.</TE>

<LD>It is Sept. 11 in America again, the first since the worst Sept. 11
in America, and today, there are games to be played.</LD>
<LD>   In Anaheim, where angry fans pelted the field with debris 13 days
ago, the Angels continue a four-game series against Oakland that has
been described in the media as crucial and vital and critical.</LD>
<LD>   In San Francisco, the Dodgers will face the Giants, often locally
referred to as "the enemy," and the big fan and media concerns are
whether the Dodgers can survive this all-important race for the
National League wild card with an emergency pitching rotation that
must find a way to prevent Barry Bonds from exploding another
491-foot bomb over the Pacific Bell Park fence.</LD>
<TE>   This is three days after the Dallas Cowboys lost to the expansion
Houston Texans in what Sports Illustrated branded the "War for Texas"
while fans in Cleveland cursed the name of Brown linebacker Dwayne
Rudd for giving his helmet a celebratory toss before the game's final
play had ended, drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty that
ultimately cost the home team a victory.</TE>
<TE>   Return to normal? That was President Bush's urgent plea to the
nation in the first days after the terrorists attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon, and sports in America, for better or
worse, have assertively snapped back into line.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, sports did not know what to do with themselves. Bob
Ley, who anchored ESPN's "SportsCenter" last Sept. 11, remembers how
network staffers and officials huddled in the hours after the attacks
and engaged in "a long and emotional debate about what we should do
that day, if anything."</TE>
<TE>   While they debated, ESPN shut down its regular programming and
turned itself over to ABC's news signal. It was eventually determined
that "SportsCenter" would make an appearance later in the day, but
only after dramatically altering its appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Out went the here-we-come theme music. Out too went smirking
anchors with their wink-wink ironic asides. Ley, a veteran journalist
who hosts the network's investigative "Outside The Lines" program,
moved into the anchor's chair for one hour of no-frills news
reportage and somber reflection.</TE>
<TE>   "In one regard we were lucky in that we had a job to do, we had
something we could do that we could focus on," Ley says. "We didn't
have to sit there and watch the media coverage and just absorb it.</TE>
<TE>   "We were obsessed, absolutely obsessed with maintaining the idea
that [sports were] just a very small sliver of this. I think what we
wanted to do is just get it down on oxide--that this is what sports
were thinking and doing during this time, but the rest of it really
doesn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   It was a broadcast for the time capsule, capturing the national
mood on that horrific day, a mood that long ago dissipated into the
mist.</TE>
<TE>   New perspective supposedly gained last September has, for the most
part, vanished from the nation's ballparks and press boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "We were supposed to get back to normal, and to a large extent, we
have," Ley says. "But if you to look at 'SportsCenter' in late August
of this year prior to the media shadow of the anniversary, or pick up
the Los Angeles Times or USA Today or the New York Times or the
[Washington] Post or the [Boston] Globe, I mean, you could read it in
a vacuum and not realize something had happened."</TE>
<TE>   In New York, where the wounded Manhattan skyline serves as a
perpetual reminder of the attacks, the summer began with Met star
catcher Mike Piazza holding impromptu media briefings to deny tabloid
insinuation he was gay and ended with baseball's owners and players
meeting on Park Avenue, deep into the 11th hour, to stave off a
season-threatening strike.</TE>
<TE>   In between, Met Manager Bobby Valentine groused about how his
team's losing streak was "killing" him and his wife and his family,
even his pet dog.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Open began every night session with a solemn tribute to
the heroes or victims of Sept. 11 and then, as soon as the first new
can of balls was opened, the tournament morphed into a farcical
circus where the major issues were Serena Williams' form-fitting
catsuit, Tommy Haas' sleeveless shirt and a fake tennis player
invented by Sports Illustrated.</TE>
<TE>   "The perspective that sports provide is that it is meaningfully
meaningless," says radio and television commentator Keith Olbermann.
"One of the reasons it had gotten so out of whack is that over the
last 20 years, we really haven't had much bad in our lives to
contrast it to--and appreciate its goodness. The players haven't had
that because of the way salaries have gone. And the fans haven't had
that.</TE>
<TE>   "We're now seeing what the playing of the games meant to our
fathers and grandfathers during the second World War. Or what it
meant that they played baseball during the Civil War. It is a
pastime, in the original sense of the word. It is something to divert
the woes and the cares of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "At its most positive aspect, the perspective that sports provide
is very basic and the appeal of sports is very basic. Then, on the
other hand, it seems as if everybody who has tried to do something to
provide perspective or be respectful or somehow pay tribute or bring
sports into a new light has failed miserably."</TE>
<TE>   Exhibits A and B: Two men named Bowden.</TE>
<TE>   In late July, Cincinnati Red General Manager Jim Bowden,
flippantly trying to illustrate what a potential players strike would
mean to Major League Baseball, told reporters: "If players want to
strike, they ought to just pick Sept. 11, because that's what it's
going to do to the game.... If they do walk out, make sure it's Sept.
11. Be symbolic. Let Donald Fehr drive the plane right into the
building, if that's what they want to do."</TE>
<TE>   In editorials for ABC Radio and Salon.com, Olbermann lobbied for
Bowden's immediate resignation, describing his words as "easily as
insensitive, as inhuman, a remark as has ever been made in baseball
history.... To compare a baseball strike to the terrorist attacks,
and union leader Donald Fehr to those who crashed the planes, is to
show you do not understand the pain this country went through last
September, or even just baseball's role in helping assuage that
pain."</TE>
<TE>   Bowden responded by issuing a written apology describing his
comments as "horrible" and "extremely insensitive" and was permitted
to stay on, keeping to the task of running a sub-.500 team.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson learned? Not quite. Barely a week later, Florida State
football Coach Bobby Bowden (no relation) announced that his team was
adopting the phrase "Let's roll" as its 2002 season motto, alluding
to the words uttered by Flight 93 passenger Todd Beamer before he and
several others attempted to overtake control of the plane from the
hijackers. The plane eventually crashed in a remote field in western
Pennsylvania, killing all 44 aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Bowden claimed he was trying to pay tribute to the bravery of
those passengers, even if he couldn't exactly remember Beamer's name,
referring to him as "that guy on that plane."</TE>
<TE>   Olbermann: "Here we have a two-word phrase from a passenger on one
of the flights that is almost--'Let's roll' is our Gettysburg
Address--and it's suddenly slapped on the side of Florida State
football. Apart from all the initial problems with that, it just
lowers the meaningfulness of that."</TE>
<TE>   A year after Sept. 11, sports in America remain what they were on
Sept. 10, 2001: diversions that alternately inspire and infuriate,
still populated by the thoughtful and the insensitive, still driven
by human nature and all that is good and bad, deep and shallow, about
it.</TE>
<TE>   "Things didn't change for America as a whole," Dodger outfielder
Marquis Grissom says, "and Sept. 11 should have been the biggest
wakeup call of all ...</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball is just baseball. You're going to have a bad week, a bad
year, pitchers aren't always going to pitch the way they're capable
of, hitters aren't always going to hit the way they're capable of.
But you have to keep things in perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Sports are games, not war, and a football defeat is a setback, not
a tragedy. This the Dallas Cowboys learned Monday morning, the day
after their embarrassing 19-10 loss to the Texans. Yes, they
discovered, every one of them, in football, there is always a
tomorrow.</TE>

<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>I look at the Golden Boy, and I can picture Oscar De La Hoya picking
up a cute kitty and then handing it to an admiring youngster.</LD>
<LD>   I look at Ferocious Fernando Vargas, and I can picture him
stepping on the little sucker--cat or kid.</LD>
<LD>   I listen to the Golden Boy talk, and I'm mesmerized by his
charisma, his thoughtful responses, and it's a good thing points
won't be awarded in Saturday's fight for personality because
Ferocious comes on like Hannibal Lecter.</LD>
<TE>   Tuesday the Golden Boy and Ferocious came together for a Bad Blood
news conference in a Mandalay Bay ballroom with fight managers and
promoters throwing hot air haymakers at each other while De La Hoya
sat restrained and above it all.</TE>
<TE>   I can see the Golden Boy eating some bad sushi, but I can't
imagine this boxing superstar carrying a grudge, and so I asked him
about Bad Blood, and he smiled and said, "I don't hate anyone; it's
just business."</TE>
<TE>   And yet there were nine armed officers from the city police
department in the room to maintain the peace between boxing camps,
two large sheets of plexiglass hung from metal frames to keep them
from beating each other up prematurely, and the expectation all hell
might break loose at any time.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel embarrassed," the Golden Boy said. "I look at [the
plexiglass] and I feel ashamed. But this is what Vargas brings to the
table. That's not me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I came here for a week to experience the hype and hoopla that
come with a major fight--up to this point in my life only enjoying a
good fight if it involved one of the brothers-in-laws and his wife.
Only one divorce so far....</TE>
<TE>   I do not see the fascination so many of my colleagues see in these
legal assaults, but now I have a future son-in-law who says going to
a fight like De La Hoya and Vargas would be the best thing that could
happen to him in life. I mentioned that to my daughter in the hope
that maybe going to see De La Hoya and Vargas really will be the best
thing that happens in the Grocery Store Bagger's life.</TE>
<TE>   On the few occasions I have seen a fight, I just see two thugs
getting into a ring with the intention of trying to kill each other
while everyone screams for more mayhem. Reminds me of Thanksgiving
dinner with the wife's family.</TE>
<TE>   But I decided to give Bad Blood a chance because The Times is
paying me to stay in Las Vegas for five days, and when I'm on an
expense account, I believe in having an open mind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THEY WERE serving cheese and fruit to the media before Tuesday's
macho news conference, which seemed a little froufrou to me until
Vargas came in dressed in a sparkling blue velvet frock that
suggested he better know how to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Odd, though, he was surrounded by a posse of big guys as if he
couldn't defend himself if called out by one of the reporters. He had
one massive guy standing behind him like some kind of bodyguard, and
if Ferocious needs a bodyguard, why would anyone feel compelled to
pay $49.95 to watch this guy fight?</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the dais, the Golden Boy sat unmoved,
reminding me of Phil Jackson coaching a Laker game, while promoter
Bob Arum and a bunch of muckety-mucks from Mandalay Bay took turns
patting each other on the back for arranging this barbaric
competition.</TE>
<TE>   A Mandalay banner was hung on one of the ballroom walls with a
quote from Arum: "These guys have a long-standing beef with each
other, so this is a real fight. This isn't something manufactured."
The gospel according to Arum.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   APPARENTLY IT'S well-known that Vargas doesn't like De La Hoya,
but hasn't been very specific why he carries a grudge. This makes no
sense because Vargas should be running up to the guy in the ring and
kissing him for giving him a $6-million payday, and a role model for
boxing success.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas kept repeating to reporters that he's in great shape, as if
a boxer being in great shape five days before he's supposed to fight
is a news flash. "I'll take my shirt off at the weigh-in and show
everyone I'm ripped," he said. Talk about moments in my career that I
will treasure always....</TE>
<TE>   Rolando Arellano, one of Vargas' managers, stepped to the
microphone and said,"De La Hoya is going to navigate the depths of
hell and face the devil," and if I were Vargas and my manager had
just called me a devil, I'd have decked him.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya, meanwhile, sat back while his trainer, Floyd
Mayweather Sr., delivered a poem designed to call Vargas out. It
wasn't Robert Frost, or even Muhammad Ali for that matter, just
mindless blabber, which seemed to go over well with the sportswriters
who like boxing.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, De La Hoya smiled when asked about the Bad Blood
charade, and said he has no idea why the fight has been billed as
such. "I've never met the guy, never talked to him," De La Hoya said.
"I'm just going to work Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   Ferocious is full of rage. The Golden Boy appears relaxed.
Ferocious wants to coax De La Hoya into an all-out street fight. The
Golden Boy said he has done his homework, and is going to target the
jaw of Ferocious. Those in the boxing know suggest De La Hoya will
emerge with a convincing victory if he's all business.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows, if everyone emerges healthy, I might be in the mood for
Bad Blood II--if Kevin Brown is agreeable to going into the ring.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Dianna Cowell:</TE>
<TE>   "My dear, sweet, naive, T.J. The world's first athlete was a
woman. Eve intercepted the apple. She passed it to Adam. He couldn't
shoot. He couldn't score. What a sin. He ate it. Typical guy.''</TE>

<LD>Jorge Cervera, a midfielder for Banfield in the Argentine first
division, was kidnapped Tuesday but escaped after a car chase and an
exchange of gunfire between police and the kidnappers in Buenos
Aires.</LD>
<LD>   The kidnappers had initially planned on robbing Cervera, 27, and
his party before recognizing him and holding him for ransom.</LD>
<LD>   According to the Associated Press, Cervera, his brother-in-law and
their female companions were driving on the outskirts of the city
just after midnight when two cars stopped them.</LD>
<TE>   After deciding to hold Cervera, the kidnappers released the women,
telling them to ask the president of Banfield for "several thousand
dollars" for Cervera's release, and to demand $1,100 from Cervera's
family.</TE>
<TE>   The women went to the police, who quickly caught up with the
kidnappers. After a short chase, the kidnappers crashed their car.
Cervera and his brother-in-law escaped during the ensuing gun battle.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the kidnappers were taken into custody.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina has had a rise in abductions and several athletes have
been targeted there, among them Lanus Coach Daniel Cordoba, the
brother of former Boca Juniors player Juan Roman Riquelme and the
father of Racing Club's Diego Milito.</TE>
<TE>   Di Canio Easing Back</TE>
<TE>   West Ham captain Paolo Di Canio is coming back from a knee injury
and Coach Glenn Roeder said he would probably use the Italian as a
substitute in today's game against West Bromwich Albion.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no problem trying to get Paolo up to speed in football
terms," Roeder said. "But what we have got to assess is his physical
fitness that you get by playing.</TE>
<TE>   "Paolo has trained well this week. It is what you expect from him.
Although he has had little football in the last four months, his
touch and awareness is still exactly the same as when he left us."</TE>
<TE>   The injured Di Canio, 34, has played a combined 65 minutes in the
last four months.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not someone who needs a couple of weeks' intense football
work to get his touch back," Roeder said.</TE>
<TE>   "He can be away from football for a number of months and the first
time he steps back on the training pitch and receives the ball, he
kills it instantly. You wouldn't think he has been away."</TE>
<TE>   Tourney Revived</TE>
<TE>   A year after the South Asian soccer tournament was postponed
because of FIFA's suspension of the Bangladesh soccer federation, the
competition will be played in January in the Bangladesh capital of
Dhaka.</TE>
<TE>   National teams from the seven South Asian nations--Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka--are expected
to participate Jan. 10-20, 2003, in the Sher-e-Bangla National
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   FIFA conditionally suspended the Bangladesh federation last Jan.
11, after its president, S.A. Sultan, a ruling party lawmaker, fired
the body's elected executive committee and appointed his own.</TE>
<TE>   FIFA lifted the suspension, which barred the country from
participating in or playing host to any international soccer events,
after the fired committee was reinstated and new elections were held
in February.</TE>
<TE>   Crew in Cup final</TE>
<TE>   A golden goal in the 108th minute by Columbus midfielder John
Wilmar Perez gave the Crew a 3-2 victory over the visiting Kansas
City Wizards Tuesday night, setting up a U.S. Open Cup final between
Columbus and the defending champion Galaxy at Crew Stadium Oct. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City had built a 2-0 lead before the Crew, which is now
6-0-1 at home in Open Cup games since 1996, scored its first goal in
the 76th minute on a score by forward Edson Buddle.</TE>
<TE>   Perez then tied it in injury time, setting the stage for his
game-winner in the second overtime.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy has won eight straight Open Cup matches. It advanced to
this year's championship game with wins over the A-League's Minnesota
Thunder, the San Jose Earthquakes and the Dallas Burn.</TE>
<TE>   The Crew made it with victories against the A-League's Richmond
Kickers, the New York/New Jersey MetroStars and the Wizards.</TE>

<HD>Luke Egan: Australian for Victory</HD>
<DH>Surfing: He overcomes Slater and fellow Aussie Campbell for
his first tour title in two years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a Fosters beer in one hand and an Australian flag draped over
his shoulder, a beaming Luke Egan, still carrying his surfboard,
scampered up the rocks and into the interview area, where he made
sure to thank those who really deserved it.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to thank all the locals for letting us come in and rip up
their spot for the past several days," he said, receiving a loud
round of applause.</LD>
<LD>   Egan then was escorted to the awards ceremony, where he was given
$30,000 for beating fellow Aussie Michael Campbell in the final of
the $285,000 Boost Mobile Pro at Lower Trestles near San Clemente.</LD>
<TE>   Ripping up Lower Trestles has been the order of the day since it
began last Thursday, as swells from Mexico and New Zealand kept sets
of large and perfectly shaped right-breaking waves pulsating in
daily.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday was no exception, the faces of many waves measuring 10
feet or higher. Still, Egan, 32, one of the more gregarious surfers
on the Assn. of Professionals' World Championship Tour, had to
negotiate through a field of surfing's biggest stars to win his first
WCT event in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Among those obstacles was the sport's most decorated athlete,
Kelly Slater, a six-time world champion trying to surf his way back
into competitive form after taking a three-year break from the tour.</TE>
<TE>   Egan, who had defeated Slater in the first round, met him again in
Tuesday's semifinal round and won, largely on a strategy that
involved paddling into any waves that came his way. Slater,
meanwhile, waited for the larger waves and was the victim of one of
the longest lulls of the contest. Egan posted modest scores on the
smaller waves and Slater fell on the only large wave that came his
way.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to go out there and surf three-foot waves," Slater
said, visibly disappointed. "I wanted to catch the five-footers that
were rolling in before my heat. I waited and watched for an hour
before my heat and there were plenty of big sets. Then, I'm out there
for 12 minutes waiting and I figured the ocean would start coming
alive at any time but ... "</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't. Slater settled for a third-place tie with Guilherme
Herdy of Brazil. It was his best finish through six WCT events this
year, but he was anything but happy.</TE>
<TE>   After pounding, with his fist, a large dent into an aluminum
garbage can under the contest tent, he proceeded to the surfers'
tent, where he took out his anger on other inanimate objects.</TE>
<TE>   Then, before the finals, Slater paddled back out to join in an
"expression session" with the other pros and was the clear winner
after pulling off a series of unbelievably difficult moves--among
them two aerial rail-grabs and a carving 360-degree turn--on one of
the larger waves.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the other pros were visibly pleased by Slater's behavior,
in and out of the water, because it reminded them of the fierce
competitor they once knew and respected.</TE>
<TE>   "I woke up all excited today because after [Monday's
quarterfinals] I knew we had the real Kelly back," said Pat
O'Connell, a Laguna Beach pro who had lost in the third round. "He
even said last night that he felt it all over again--and that's what
we all want to see."</TE>
<TE>   What the crowd at Lower Trestles saw over the last six days was
not only the best surf to have swept over the cobblestone-lined point
break in decades, but the highest level of competition ever in
California, contest director Mike Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   What the crowd did not see was an American get past the
semifinals. One by one, the 13 U.S. surfers--two from Southern
California; five from Hawaii--on the 46-man World Championship Tour
roster fell, leaving Slater as their lone representative on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Slater, 30, of Cocoa Beach, Fla., was also among a small group of
pro surfers taking part in a touching paddle-out ceremony to honor
the victims of last Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   During a 12-minute observance in which the ocean remained eerily
calm, the surfers joined in a circle on their boards, cast leis and
sprinkled some World Trade Center rubble into the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Then, immediately after the singing of "The Star Spangled Banner,"
a large set of waves rolled in and the surfers proceeded to rip Lower
Trestles anew before giving the break back to the finalists and,
ultimately, the locals.</TE>
<TE>   Who looked pretty good out there too.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Loses Fairfax's Burns</HD>
<DH>College basketball: He is released from letter of intent
after NCAA says he hasn't met eligibility requirements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Evan Burns, a McDonald's All-American basketball player from Fairfax
High, was released from his letter of intent by UCLA on Tuesday after
the NCAA determined that he did not meet initial eligibility
requirements.</LD>
<LD>   Burns will attempt to enroll at San Diego State as a partial
qualifier, sources said, which would make him ineligible for one
year. He can appeal to attempt to gain immediate eligibility</LD>
<LD>   Burns had been admitted to UCLA provisionally because his
grade-point average and SAT score were acceptable. However, the NCAA
Clearinghouse--which determines eligibility--is embroiled in a
dispute with Fairfax over Burns' required "core" classes.</LD>
<TE>   Burns attended summer school at UCLA and could have remained bound
by his letter of intent while appealing the NCAA ruling. But he
decided to cut ties with UCLA because fall classes at San Diego State
began Sept. 3 and he must gain admittance in the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State judges partial qualifiers case by case. There have
been no partial qualifiers in Coach Steve Fisher's three seasons,
although a few Aztec football players have been admitted as partials,
among them running back Larry Ned, now with the Oakland Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   If Burns is not admitted at San Diego State, he might try to gain
admittance at Fresno State or could play professionally in Europe and
make himself eligible for next year's NBA draft.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of the 6-foot-8 Burns, who averaged 23.5 points and 8.3
rebounds at Fairfax, is another blow to UCLA's front line, which will
be without sophomore forward Andre Patterson at least for the fall
semester because of academic problems.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins top rebounders last season, Dan Gadzuric and Matt
Barnes, were seniors. Freshmen post players Michael Fey and Ryan
Hollins will be expected to contribute immediately, backing up a
small starting lineup of 6-10 center T.J. Cummings and four perimeter
players--seniors Jason Kapono and Ray Young, and sophomores Cedric
Bozeman and Dijon Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   Losing Burns opens a second scholarship for the 2003-04 season and
improves UCLA's chances of landing highly touted Trevor Ariza, a 6-7
Westchester High forward who plays the same position as Burns.</TE>
<TE>   Ariza and Aaron Brooks, a point guard from Seattle Franklin High,
are the top players on Coach Steve Lavin's wish list.</TE>

<HD>Manning Is Ready for Matchup With Woods</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the first marquee matchup of the UCLA season, and it couldn't be
more visible.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA's Ricky Manning Jr., a two-time All-Pacific 10 cornerback,
will cover Oklahoma State's Rashaun Woods, an All-Big 12 receiver who
had 80 catches last season.</LD>
<LD>   One on one. Manning o mano.</LD>
<TE>   Woods will split out wide. Manning will crowd the line of
scrimmage and crouch a few feet from the receiver's face.</TE>
<TE>   They'll talk, saying things no one but them can hear.</TE>
<TE>   They'll bump at the snap, race downfield, leap and struggle for a
spiral, doing things everyone at Oklahoma State's Lewis Field can
see.</TE>
<TE>   And they'll repeat it for four quarters. Woods is a go-to guy and
Manning is a guy who makes opponents sorry they went to their go-to
guy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more excited about this week than last week," Manning said.
"I can put myself on the map, prove myself as a premier cornerback,
represent my school, myself and my conference."</TE>
<TE>   Woods has already done plenty of proving. The junior had nine
catches for 175 yards last week against Northern Iowa and 10 catches
for 126 yards and three touchdowns in the Cowboy opener against
Louisiana Tech.</TE>
<TE>   He led the Big 12 with 1,023 receiving yards last season and is
already No. 2 on Oklahoma State's career receiving list with 128,
trailing Hart Lee Dykes (203).</TE>
<TE>   "They isolate [Woods] as much as possible, and as soon as they see
him one-on-one with somebody, they throw to him," said Phil Snow, the
Bruin defensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Snow is shrewd enough to have a contingency plan as well.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working on other things in case Ricky isn't playing, in
case he's injured," Snow said. "He'll line up one-on-one against him
throughout the game, although sometimes that will be to disguise
something else."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Guard Eyoseph Efseaff sat out the first series against Colorado
State for violating a team rule. Efseaff, a sophomore two-year
starter, will start Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Asi Faoa's request for work furlough will be addressed today in
Los Angeles Superior Court. The junior defensive end was sentenced to
180 days in jail a year ago for misdemeanor assault stemming from a
March 2000 fight at a fraternity party.</TE>
<TE>   Faoa settled a civil suit last summer with the victim, Rodrigo
DeZubiria. Faoa will pay DeZubiria $100,000 if he makes an NFL roster
within three years after leaving UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thunderstorms are forecast for Stillwater, Okla., Saturday, which
could help UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins displayed a strong ground game against Colorado State,
pounding for 215 yards behind a veteran offensive line. Oklahoma
State is a pass-oriented team.</TE>

<DH>Because of a lack of depth, several members of USC's
freshman class are having to jump into the fray</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Receiver Mike Williams saw the battalion of television cameras and
was overcome by a case of big-screen nerves.</LD>
<LD>   Fullback Brandon Hancock listened as more than 63,000 fans roared
but heard only his heartbeat.</LD>
<LD>   USC's prime-time season opener against Auburn on Labor Day
initially produced sensory overload for Williams, Hancock and eight
other true freshmen, each playing his first college game. Touching
the ball--or smashing into the opponent--calmed the youngest Trojans,
and they went on to savor the taste of a 24-17 victory.</LD>
<TE>   "It was nice to get first-game jitters out of the way in the first
game of your college career," Hancock said. "We have a group of young
guys that took advantage of opportunities in training camp. All of us
think we've earned our way, and we want to do everything we can to
help SC win."</TE>
<TE>   On a team that features marquee seniors such as quarterback Carson
Palmer, wide receiver Kareem Kelly and All-American safety Troy
Polamalu, the Trojans' success or failure could be determined by as
many as a dozen players less than a year removed from high school.
They will get their next test Saturday when No. 17 USC plays No. 18
Colorado (1-1) at Boulder, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   "The freshmen jumped right in and showed that they are going to be
a factor," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   "You get better by playing, and it looks like they're going to be
playing a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Second-year Coach Pete Carroll encourages the youth movement--out
of necessity.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason to just wait and red-shirt guys," he said.
"We're not deep enough to do that. There may be a time when we can't
legitimately say that, but right now we need the young guys to help
us win."</TE>
<TE>   Those, essentially, are the words Carroll and recruiting
coordinator Ed Orgeron used in wooing a freshman class regarded by
some as among the nation's best.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't lying when they said we would get a chance,"
offensive lineman Fred Matua said. "We got the chance and took
advantage of it."</TE>
<TE>   Matua got his opportunity the first day of training camp, when
senior guard Zach Wilson suffered a foot strain. Matua, who played at
Wilmington Banning High, was immediately moved into Wilson's spot and
was on track to become the first true freshman to start an opener on
the offensive line for USC since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Then he suffered a bruised right knee a few days before the Auburn
game and did not play until USC's fourth series. He alternated with
senior Derek Graf the rest of the game, was on the field for the
fourth-quarter, game-winning drive and threw the block that allowed
Palmer to sneak into the end zone for the final touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Other freshmen also played key roles.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, from Tampa, Fla., emerged as the No. 3 receiver in
training camp by catching almost every pass thrown his way and using
his 6-foot 5-inch frame to outjump cornerbacks in the end zone. He
had four receptions for 56 yards against Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   "The first play I got in, the ball was coming to me," Williams
said. "It was exactly what I needed. I caught the pass, got hit and
realized it wasn't as hard as when guys like Troy [Polamalu] and
[safety] DeShaun Hill are trying to kill you in practice."</TE>
<TE>   Hancock graduated a semester early from Fresno Clovis West High
and enrolled at USC last spring to get a head start.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone at other schools talks about red-shirting the first
year, but I figured if I was going to put in all this work, I wanted
to play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock's strength, speed, pass-catching and blocking put him on a
par with seniors Chad Pierson and Sunny Byrd. Against Auburn, he
alternated with Byrd, caught a three-yard pass, rushed for a yard and
made a tackle on a punt return.</TE>
<TE>   Punter Tom Malone also graduated a semester early--from Temescal
Canyon High in Lake Elsinore--and enrolled at USC last spring, hoping
to become the first-string punter. He achieved that goal and averaged
42 yards for three punts against Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   "I was nervous the first time I went out there, and there are some
things I could have done better," Malone said. "But getting that over
with in the first game is going to make it easier the rest of the
way."</TE>
<TE>   Justin Wyatt, who played at Compton Dominguez High, contended for
a starting position at left cornerback in training camp and played
the second half against Auburn after Ronald Nunn suffered a hip
injury.</TE>
<TE>   "The first couple of plays, I was a little scared, but they didn't
really come at me as much as I'm sure they wanted to," Wyatt said. "I
actually wanted them to come at me to see where I was at. It's going
to happen one way or another."</TE>
<TE>   Other true freshmen made smaller contributions. Linebacker Oscar
Lua registered the season's first tackle on the opening kickoff,
safety Mike Ross delivered two key blocks on kickoff returns and
linebacker Dallas Sartz helped squelch an Auburn comeback on the
final series.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Hershel Dennis was on the field but did not get an
opportunity to return a kickoff. Tight end Dominique Byrd played on
special teams.</TE>
<TE>   USC's freshman presence could be even more prominent against
Colorado. Offensive lineman Winston Justice did not play against
Auburn but he worked with the first-unit offense during the bye week
and appears on track to start at right tackle in place of redshirt
junior Eric Torres.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take everyone--seniors, juniors, sophomores and
freshmen--for us to have the kind of season we're all hoping for,"
Hancock said. "The way the young guys look at it, we're just doing
our part."</TE>

<HD>Nunn Breaks Thumb, but He Plans to Play</HD>

<LD>Ronald Nunn, USC's starting left cornerback, broke his right thumb
during practice Tuesday, but said he will play Saturday against
Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   Nunn suffered the injury as he tried to strip the ball from
receiver Mike Williams during a drill. X-rays revealed a broken bone
and Nunn was fitted with a cast that encases his hand up to his
forearm and must be worn for six to eight weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "They're just going to put some padding around it so I can't use
it as a weapon," Nunn said.</LD>
<TE>   The broken bone is the third injury Nunn has suffered since
arriving from San Francisco City College.</TE>
<TE>   He nursed a hamstring strain through much of training camp but
still won the starting spot after senior Kevin Arbet suffered a
season-ending foot injury.</TE>
<TE>   Nunn suffered a hip pointer in the opener against Auburn during a
pile-up after a fumble on Auburn's first series. He played the first
half but was replaced by freshman Justin Wyatt for the second.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday morning, Nunn said he was fit. For an hour or two after
injuring his thumb, he was not sure of his status.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew something was wrong because immediately a big old knot
came up and I couldn't move it in any direction," Nunn said. "They
said if it was any higher on my thumb they would have had to put some
pins in there."</TE>
<TE>   Nunn said the cast could prevent him from intercepting a pass, but
not deflecting one.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as the receiver doesn't catch the ball, I'll be doing my
job."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman linebacker Oscar Lua was carted off the field after he
was kicked in the right shin, but X-rays were negative.... Running
back Justin Fargas participated in light drills but remains slowed by
a strained right hamstring. Fargas missed the opener and wants to
play Saturday. "I think it's going to come all the way down to the
game to make a decision," he said.... There are no players from
Colorado on USC's roster. Colorado features 20 Californians.</TE>

<HD>Police Investigating Angels' Washburn</HD>
<DH>Jurisprudence: Female accuses 28-year-old pitcher of sexual
assault. He has not been charged or arrested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jarrod Washburn, the ace of the Angels' pitching staff, is under
investigation for alleged sexual assault, Anaheim police said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Washburn has not been charged or arrested. The Orange County
district attorney's office is expected to receive the results of the
investigation shortly and then decide whether to file charges.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Rick Martinez, a spokesman for the Anaheim Police Department,
said the investigation began Sept. 1, when a female approached the
department and made the accusation against Washburn, and said the
probe was "very close to a conclusion." Martinez said he could not
provide details, including the age of the accuser. KABC-TV, using an
unidentified source, said the female is 16 years old.</LD>
<TE>   "These allegations are baseless and meritless," said Scott Boras,
the agent for Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, 28, left the team Tuesday afternoon to be with his
family. The Angels were uncertain when he would return.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe it's true," one Angel player said. "But it would
be terrible timing if it is."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation comes during the final month of an otherwise
magical season, with the Angels in position to advance to the
playoffs for the first time in 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels led the American League West in August 1997, when Tony
Phillips was arrested and charged with felony cocaine possession.
Phillips, like Washburn considered a team leader, returned to the
team after 10 days. But the Angels lost 21 of 30 games following his
arrest and fell out of first place for good. Phillips ultimately
pleaded guilty; as a first-time offender, the charge was dismissed
after Phillips completed drug counseling and remained drug-free for
one year.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Troy Percival, part of the 1997 team, said this year's
Angels would not fall apart and vowed they would make the playoffs.
The Angels entered play Tuesday with a four-game lead in the
wild-card standings.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no excuses for not going out and competing at the highest
level," Percival said. "We're all focused on one goal.</TE>
<TE>   "We're this close to the playoffs. We're going to get there."</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Tim Salmon, also a member of the 1997 team, said this
year's Angels would not let the investigation of Washburn divert
their attention from the pennant race.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a teammate and we stand behind him," Salmon said. "But, from
our standpoint, we've got business to do. We've got the kind of
players who I don't think will be distracted."</TE>
<TE>   Boras said Washburn would be cleared of the allegations and said
the pitcher had not retained a defense attorney.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Bill Stoneman said the Angels were cooperating
with the investigation and had no plans to suspend Washburn or place
him on leave pending the outcome of the probe.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Chairman Michael Eisner is aware of the investigation,
Angel spokesman Tim Mead said. In the Phillips case, Disney suspended
him, in accordance with company policy but in violation of the labor
agreement between players and owners. An arbitrator overturned the
suspension and forced the Angels to reinstate Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   Disney spokesman John Spelich would not comment on the
investigation. If a Disney employee is arrested, he said, the company
takes into account the nature of the charge and the circumstances
involved before deciding what action to take, including whether to
put the employee on leave.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn has been married for three years and has one son. He has
emerged as one of the top pitchers in the league this season, with a
17-5 record and 3.32 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   He has started two games since the investigation began and won
both. His victory Sunday at Baltimore made him the first Angel
pitcher to win 17 games since 1991.</TE>

<HD>Webber Says He Will Fight Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Chris Webber proclaimed his innocence anew Tuesday as he vowed to
fight charges that he lied to a federal grand jury in Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   Ignoring the advice of his lawyers, Webber, a former University of
Michigan basketball player who now plays for the Sacramento Kings,
said he was speaking out because, "I wanted to show my supporters I
am not running away from the situation. I will fight this case to the
end, and I feel that I will be vindicated."</LD>
<LD>   Webber was indicted Monday on charges he misrepresented his
dealings with Ed Martin, a former Michigan booster who claims he lent
the NBA star $280,000 while Webber was an amateur player. Martin also
said he lent money to other Michigan basketball players, two of whom
have admitted taking it.</LD>
<TE>   "I did not lie to the grand jury," Webber said at the Kings'
practice complex.</TE>
<TE>   Webber, who led Michigan's Fab Five team to two NCAA title games,
has repeatedly denied taking significant amounts of money from
Martin. Webber was charged with obstruction of justice and making a
false declaration before a grand jury, according to the FBI and U.S.
attorney's office in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum penalty Webber faces on each charge is five years and
a fine of $250,000.</TE>
