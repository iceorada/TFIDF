<HD>Of Crazy Charlie and Crimes Against Children</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I knew a man a long time ago who liked to "touch" little boys. It was
a term parents used to describe what would be known today as child
molesting.</LD>
<LD>   We were all aware of the guy as kids and avoided him as though he
were a leper. Privately, we called him Crazy Charlie and warned
anyone new in the neighborhood to never go near him.</LD>
<LD>   Oddly, no one ever turned him in to the police, even the parents
of the kids who had been subjected to Charlie's abuse. We simply
understood, as a gazelle understands a lion, that he was not to be
trusted.</LD>
<TE>   Charlie was married, but hardly anyone ever saw his wife. They
lived in a small, dark house at the end of the block. Some said
they'd had a son who died young, and people in the neighborhood
speculated that was what drove Charlie over the edge.</TE>
<TE>   I guess it was on that basis that we forgave the man his
craziness, but as it turned out, Charlie just couldn't forgive
himself. One soft summer night when we were playing kick the can near
Charlie's home, we heard a loud bang.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors rushed to the house and found him lying on his bed, an
old World War I pistol at his side. His wife was in a chair nearby,
as cold and silent as stone.</TE>
<TE>   Every kid on the block crammed into the house to look at Charlie's
body. We felt sorry for him in a way, except for one boy, who'd been
one of Charlie's victims.</TE>
<TE>   He had a look on his face I can see to this very day, full of
hatred and anger. He held it for a long time, just staring at the
body, until the police came and chased us out. We went back to
playing kick the can and wondered if Charlie was in hell.</TE>
<TE>   I hadn't thought about Charlie until the other day when federal
investigators announced they'd charged 89 people with belonging to an
online pornography ring. The FBI said that 27 of them had admitted
molesting children. This brought back a clear image of the guy who,
back in our neighborhood, had "touched" all those little boys.</TE>
<TE>   Crazy Charlie could have been among the 89, a number that included
Little League coaches, members of the clergy, a school bus driver and
at least one police officer. They are all someone's neighbor and so
was Charlie, even though we were wise to him.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back through our newspaper files, I discovered how many
child molesters, or accused child molesters, are in positions of
trust and responsibility. I suppose you could say that Catholic
priests are among the most trusted because they claim to be agents of
God, a declaration that has lost a lot of its luster in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   But they aren't alone. Here are some headlines from the past few
months:</TE>
<TE>   "Rabbi Accused of Molesting Young Male Students"</TE>
<TE>   "Judge Charged With Molesting Boy, 12"</TE>
<TE>   "Therapist Charged With Molesting Girl"</TE>
<TE>   "School Trustee Accused of Molestation"</TE>
<TE>   "Band Teacher Accused of Molesting Girl"</TE>
<TE>   Foster parents, a Boy Scout leader, a disc jockey, a day-care
worker, a stepfather, a janitor, an Army recruiter, a nurse, an
attorney, a grandfather, a school board member.</TE>
<TE>   They seek out not only those within their immediate range, like a
boy in the choir or a little girl next door, but now prey upon
children through cyberspace, like digitally created monsters prowling
the night. But they aren't cartoons and they don't look like
monsters. Unlike Crazy Charlie, they seem to be the kind of people
whose hand a small child might willingly take.</TE>
<TE>   The victims of molestation often grow to adulthood burdened by
feelings of guilt and shame. Their legacy is not only a shattered
trust, but in the odd juxtaposition of human victimization and
response, they too sometimes become molesters.</TE>
<TE>   Encino family therapist Michael Aharoni speculates that a child
robbed of his dignity by sexual abuse sometimes seeks to regain his
power by abusing.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what molestation is all about," he says. "Like rape, it's
not about sex but about power and the abuse of power. Victims of
molestation are apt to become sexually repressed and unable to trust
an adult relationship. So they seek out children.</TE>
<TE>   "In most ways," he says, "they're normal people, and I don't want
to let them off the hook by saying they're sick. They made a decision
to do something harmful, and we need to punish them for their
behavior. I don't want them to get away."</TE>
<TE>   I agree. Crimes against children claw at the very nature of
humanity. Molestation creates distrust not only in its victims, but
in the body politic as a whole. We already distrust leadership. Are
we now to distrust our moral counselors?</TE>
<TE>   "What loneliness," asked the writer George Eliot, "is more lonely
than distrust?"</TE>
<TE>   The question resonates through a culture in turmoil, and no one
seems to have the right answer. But I keep seeing that dark and angry
face of a young boy staring at the body of Crazy Charlie, and all
these years later, the rage still comes through.</TE>

<LD>Photographer Michel Comte dashes from one group of serious buyers to
the next during the art and jewelry auction, periodically removing
his thick-framed glasses to wipe his brow.</LD>
<LD>   It is an exclusive crowd at the Ace Gallery Los Angeles on Tuesday
night. Actors, models and artist patrons--many of them friends of
Comte--arrive intent on spending thousands for a good cause: to aid
war victims in Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Angola.</LD>
<LD>   Comte, along with Geraldine Chaplin and producer Arthur Cohn, is
hosting the evening, and as the bare walls of the room echo with the
auctioneer's staccato delivery, he searches the room for friendly
faces. He's a self-described recluse who shies away from the media.
("I've only been out once in the last two months," he says later.)</LD>
<TE>   Circulating through the party, Comte lights on Daryl Hannah near
the entrance. He looks up to see his 1990 color photo of Mike Tyson's
arm, holding a dove, sell for $13,000. Then he heads to the back of
the room with Uma Thurman, whom he's known since her teenage modeling
days. He huddles with Dennis Hopper, then Macy Gray, and poses for a
photograph with Vanity Fair Editor Graydon Carter.</TE>
<TE>   The auctioneer's gavel sounds: Comte's black-and-white photo of a
bare-chested, barefoot Sting sells for $5,500.</TE>
<TE>   A sexy mixed-media piece, "Bedroom Fantasies," by Robert Graham,
goes for $15,000. Moments later, Julian Schnabel's 1995 oil on carpet
titled "Carpet Painting for the International Red Cross" brings
$180,000--the night's largest sale. (Early estimates have the event
bringing in more than $1 million for the International Committee of
the Red Cross and the American Red Cross.)</TE>
<TE>   In May, Comte heads to Kabul, Afghanistan. "I've seen a great deal
of misery," he says the next day, sitting poolside at the Bel-Air
Hotel. But he adds, "When you raise a lot of money, you can move a
few stones."</TE>
<TE>   What Would Nan</TE>
<TE>   the Nanny Do?</TE>
<TE>   Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus worked as nannies for more than
two dozen Upper East Side families in New York for seven years.</TE>
<TE>   And they lived to tell in "The Nanny Diaries," a satirical look at
Park Avenue family life.</TE>
<TE>   Their comedy of manners (and lack of) has Manhattanites guessing:
Who is Mrs. X, the spoiled and needy mother who employs Nanny not
only to prepare Coquilles St. Jacques for her 4-year-old son Grayer,
but also to smile at her excuses and admire her taste?</TE>
<TE>   Alas, the authors insist the characters are composites, and a note
to readers instructs that "names and characters are the product of
the authors' imagination."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a comedy piece--it's exaggerated," Kraus says. But, "it
reflects the real challenges in the job."</TE>
<TE>   And one character, at least, became real: Nan, the overworked and
underpaid heroine.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, "we would wonder, 'What would Nan do?'" McLaughlin
says, adding that the through-the-keyhole perspective of the help has
been used by Shakespeare, Chekhov and Tolstoy. "There's always a
nanny figure."</TE>
<TE>   Among the rules of nannying the two compiled is this (No. 7):
"Validate. Validate. Validate: 'That new Birkin bag was so worth the
wait.'" And especially, "'Oh, no, you were right, there was
absolutely no need for you to come to the school play.'"</TE>
<TE>   But the No. 1 rule, according to the authors is this: "Love the
kid. Because you're going to hate everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote:</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that could prevent this result, would be that the
Academy decides, from a feeling of guilt, to repair the damage that
was done to Denzel Washington [by not giving him an Oscar] for "The
Hurricane." Outside of that, I can't see that there would be another
reason for Russell [Crowe] not to get it."</TE>

objective take on why his star will, or won't, win the best actor
Academy Award.</TE>

<HD>Reinventing the Past, One Chair at a Time</HD>
<DH>Michael Berman has built a reputation creating furniture
that puts a sleek, timeless spin on tradition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY YOUNG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Berman was driving through mid-Wilshire when he came across a
1960s French Provincial sofa abandoned in an alley. To most people,
it would have been a castoff destined for the dump. But to Berman--a
design alchemist who transmutes old classics into new ones--it was
loaded with potential.</LD>
<LD>   So despite the big brass casters and mustard-yellow brocade that
screamed utter cluelessness, Berman hauled the sofa back to his
workroom. There he modified the arms, swapped the wheels for legs,
reupholstered with parchment linen. And voila! He'd turned a dowdy
relic into contemporary seating that whispered sophistication.</LD>
<LD>   "Six years ago there was a niche to fill. I couldn't find
furniture that had both historical references and a modern look
without being too trendy, so I designed it myself," Berman explains.
"Now I think of what I do as ready-to-wear, kind of like clothing. It
mixes easily with antiques or can be used on its own."</LD>
<TE>   Since 1986 Berman has built a reputation as an interior designer
who reenvisions the past and gives rooms a sleek, timeless spin. More
recently he's become known for an ever-expanding line of high-end
custom furniture.</TE>
<TE>   The collection, which debuted in 1996, numbers about 75 pieces,
including earth-toned sofas and chairs, tables and beds, lamps and
mirrors. Available through the Bradbury Collection showroom, his
furniture has just earned Berman the Pacific Design Center's 2002
Star of Design award for product design. This year's other award
winners include architect Michael Maltzan, interior designer Frank
Pennino, artist Robert Graham, photographer Greg Gorman, developer
Tom Gilmore and graphic designer Carlos Diniz, who died last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael creates furniture that's incredibly stylish and chic.
There's nothing tricky about it," says Margaret Russell, editor in
chief of Elle Decor. "With tricky furniture, you don't know if it's a
chair or a piece of art. But his is a very tailored, cohesive
collection."</TE>
<TE>   Trained by American designer Angelo Donghia, Berman embraces the
classically influenced modern aesthetic that Donghia brought to fine
furniture in the '60s. With an emphasis on style, comfort and
craftmanship, Berman reinterprets familiar shapes and makes them
fresh again.</TE>
<TE>   Take the Klismos Armchair, which retails for $1,600. He resized
the saber legs of the klismos (an ancient Greek form) for a stouter
silhouette, cushioned the seat and splat, then added arms carved with
a subtle Greek key detail. For Jack's Club Chair ($2,600), named in
honor of his father, Berman took the large, boxy character of the
traditional club chair and incorporated a serpentine back for a
lighter rear profile and, while he was at it, padded the arms and
back, not merely the seat, with down for a pillowy softness.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael has a good eye, a great sense of line and proportion,"
says Kerry Joyce, another L.A. interior designer who produces his own
furniture. "His designs are reminiscent of a bygone era, but he adds
a modern sensibility so they're not just period pieces."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Detroit, the 41-year-old Berman was in tune with his inner
designer early on. When he was 5, his parents were already asking his
opinion on everything from furnishings to wall and floor coverings
for the family's new house. By the time he was 10, Berman was
collecting bentwood furniture rather than baseball cards and
rearranging the living room instead of playing football.</TE>
<TE>   He has always been fascinated by Art Deco and American Moderne
design from the '20s and '30s. "I was a fan of the age of
transatlantic travel--the cars, the trains, aviation," he says. "The
furniture was clean, curvilinear and had a wonderful sense of
movement."</TE>
<TE>   At 19, Berman enrolled in art classes at the Center for Creative
Studies in Detroit but dropped out to pursue acting. A singer and
dancer in high school, he immediately landed a job in the chorus line
at Radio City Music Hall. Berman was thrilled to perform in New York,
but about a year later realized his true passion was more for Radio
City's famous architecture than its footlights. "I used to wander
through the building and photograph all the Art Deco details," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, 21 and eager to embark on a new career, Berman landed a
job in the Donghia sample room in L.A. "It was akin to being the
busboy," he says of organizing fabric swatches and product
information sheets. But he proved to be a quick study and was
eventually promoted to the furniture operation. "It felt like I was
called to the White House."</TE>
<TE>   Berman assisted Donghia whenever the acclaimed designer visited
from New York. As chauffeur and right-hand man, Berman hung on
Donghia's every word. "I got an incredible education in the tailoring
of fine furniture," he recalls. "I learned all about color, scale,
proportion and construction from one of the best. I also learned
diplomacy and how to interact with employees and clients. His example
is something I put down on paper and still review today as I try to
apply the same principles to my business."</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, a year after Donghia died at age 50, Berman struck out on
his own, establishing his Melrose-area firm, Michael Berman Limited.
He developed a signature style of restrained glamour that not
surprisingly owes a debt to Donghia as well as to Deco visionaries
Paul Frankl and Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, his work has graced contemporary houses and a
handful of historically significant homes by Richard Neutra, Paul
Williams, Raphael Soriano and Roland Coate. "If I had my druthers,
I'd always work on architecturally noteworthy projects," Berman says,
"but it really doesn't matter whether they're vintage or modern as
long as I like the clients." The names on his client list include
several Hollywood celebrities, plus artist Lari Pittman, writer/food
critic Merrill Shindler and ABC Television president Steven
Bornstein.</TE>
<TE>   Today Berman draws inspiration from a select group of his peers.
In addition to the furniture of fellow Angeleno Joyce ("It's very
delicately executed and always classic"), he admires the designs of
France's Christian Liagre ("I love his primitive but modern
approach") and Andree Putman ("She can make cold, sharp, hard
materials look incredibly soft and sensuous").</TE>
<TE>   Vintage photos by Irving Penn and treasures found at the Long
Beach Swap Meet provide other points of creative departure. Berman
stashes them in the Hollywood Hills home he shares with partner Lee
Weinstein, a clinical social worker/psychotherapist, and their pet
basenji, Fritz. "My house is either a phenomenal showcase for my
furniture," he says, "or else an incredible dumping ground for found
objects."</TE>
<TE>   Like his mentor Donghia, Berman personally attends to quality
control and continues to seek innovation, setting aside as much as
nine months to make and test one prototype. "I don't like the current
homogenization of shapes and finishes," he says. Which explains his
plans to introduce the new elliptical Mansfield dining table in a
satin-sheen ecru lacquer (priced at $7,600) and offer other pieces in
new sand and cinnabar ceruse-on-oak finishes. "They're dramatic, but
I think people are looking for something they haven't seen before."</TE>
<TE>   These days Berman spends less time on interior design as the
demands of his collection grow. "I couldn't say which I enjoy more,
but there's something about seeing how total strangers gravitate to
my furniture," he says. "It's the ultimate high to get a call from a
housewife in Des Moines, Iowa, who's clipped a picture from a
magazine."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile he has begun to branch out, creating ceramic tiles for
Santa Barbara-based Astor Tileworks, area rugs for Aga John and
plumbing fixtures for Rohl. In December he launched a catalog of
hotel furniture. By the end of this year he hopes to recolor the
palette for a major paint manufacturer. And after that he wouldn't
mind coming up with a line of tableware, breaking into restaurant
interiors or perhaps opening his own retail showroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't stop designing," Berman insists, "till someone puts me in
my grave."</TE>

<LD>ROUSE UP O YOUNG MEN OF THE NEW AGE!</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Kenzaburo Oe</LD>
<TE>   Translated from the Japanese by John Nathan</TE>
<TE>   Grove Press</TE>
<TE>   260 pages; $24</TE>
<TE>   The oeuvre of Kenzaburo Oe, holder of the 1994 Nobel Prize in
literature, comprises more than 15 volumes of fiction and essays.
However, Oe remains best-known for his 1964 novel "A Personal
Matter," and justly so: Even today, this hour-by-hour chronicle of a
self-lacerating young father's coming to grips with the birth of his
brain-deformed son has lost none of its searing immediacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Rouse Up O Young Men of the New Age!," originally published in
Japanese in 1984, is not Oe's most recent novel. But it is his newest
appearance in English, in this able and judicious translation by John
Nathan, who has also contributed an illuminating afterword. The novel
has a special significance within the arc of Oe's literal
life-in-fiction. Aspects of the handicapped child who entered the
world in 1964 have provided the inspiration, or compulsion, for a
whole series of novels, notable both for their bending of
autobiography into fiction and for the sheer originality of Oe's
vision. In the year in which this novel takes place, the burdensome,
beloved son has reached the age of 20. For the narrator father, here
called simply K, this marks both an ending and beginning, a time for
summing up. For Oe the writer it appears to demand the final version
of his fictionalization of self-with-son.</TE>
<TE>   Neither man goes easy on himself. At the outset of the last
chapter, the writer and essayist K declares outright, "My purpose, on
the occasion of my son's twentieth birthday this coming June, was to
survey the entirety of our--mine and my wife's and his younger
brother's and sister's--days together with him until now and into the
future. I also wanted a book of definitions of the world, society,
and mankind based on my own life." In this brief yet extraordinarily
dense novel, the "entirety" is conveyed through a series of dramatic
incidents, generally not at first glance closely related as
narrative, but more as the plausible associations of K's memory.
These include episodes of arresting vividness.</TE>
<TE>   One occurs at an indoor swimming pool where K has been doggedly
attempting to teach his son (lugubriously nicknamed Eeyore) to swim.
During a break K's attention is diverted by the bumptious and
distrusted Mr. Shumata, trainer of a shady group of young
paramilitary men. Suddenly, the young men start shouting. "With a
move so very slow it felt contemptible even to myself, I turned
around and verified that Eeyore was not sitting on the bench. As I
stood there Mr. Shumata sailed past me with astonishing agility ....
Before the ripples had spread across the surface I glimpsed Eeyore,
his mouth wide open, slowly sinking as though he were swimming in
space. 'Down, down thro' the immense, with outcry, fury &amp;
despair'--the line occurred to me out of context as I leaned over the
tank with both hands on the rim. In front of my nose, Mr. Shumata's
large, red foot with the missing toes was thrust above the water as
he spiraled perpendicularly down to the bottom of the tank."</TE>
<TE>   Oe's skill shines through as the impact of these incidents and
images accumulates. The end effect is less a survey and more a
convincing impression of landscape, perspective and detail as
conveyed by a few brushstrokes from the hand of a master. The reader
experiences not only the stumbles and surprises of Eeyore's
maturation (like Oe's son he begins to emerge as a gifted composer)
but also the middle-aged K's gnawing self-doubt and anxieties. He
wonders: "It seemed to me I had failed to accomplish a single thing
... wasn't that due to my dependence on Eeyore's disability and my
desire to remain with him forever in the domain of childhood?"
Beneath this suspicion the reader perceives a darker tension: How can
the father who first wished for his newborn's swift death ever be
fully redeemed? Who is truly deformed, the father or the son?
Wherever K looks, he finds evidence of his failure to measure up,
whether as Eeyore's guide to life, as a creative artist or as a
political thinker.</TE>
<TE>   K mentally flagellates himself for falling short of his second
goal: to define the world, society and mankind. The grandiosity of
his mission betrays a surreally off-kilter quality in his overall
outlook--a tendency to assign emblematic significance to his thoughts
and actions and assume society at large does the same. Not
coincidentally, with this trait he also mirrors the combination of
artistic star-reaching and personal diffidence characteristic of K's
artistic idol, 18th century poet William Blake. Throughout, "Rouse Up
O Young Men" is saturated, effectively and poignantly, with lines
from Blake's poetry, re-creations of his artwork, episodes from his
life. The interweaving of two writers, and of biography and
autobiography, may not be everyone's cup of bancha. But for those who
enjoy reading with minds open to the new, K's dawning conception of
his son as embodying Blake's visions of both good and evil, and his
final intimation of revelation and forgiveness, are among the ample
rewards.</TE>

<DH>Melinda Taylor's Disney Hall garden will bring a fresh look
downtown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since it was first conceived 14 years ago, the Walt Disney Concert
Hall has had a number of different garden plans by big-time
designers. But since construction began four years ago, the person
behind the hall's gardens has been Melinda Taylor, a little-known
designer with a two-person practice over a cell phone store in Silver
Lake.</LD>
<LD>   As preparations begin for the garden's installation this August,
the vision of this unknown garden designer will become part of a new
downtown Los Angeles landmark when the hall formally opens for the
concert season of fall 2003. If Taylor's style of urban gardening
catches on, it may redefine landscaping rules for downtown
skyscrapers.</LD>
<LD>   It all started quite casually, Taylor recalls. She came in on the
job as architect Frank Gehry was deciding to switch the building's
cladding from stone to stainless steel. "They were thinking of doing
something really simple," she says. "They were going to do a couple
of oak trees in a field of decomposed granite. They asked me to
choose the trees and I said, 'Sure.'"</LD>
<TE>   Then Gehry began thinking that he might like some color reflecting
in that steel and started firing questions over to Taylor. What about
this tree? That tree? Before too long, the plan was to garland the
neck of the galleon-like structure with ever-changing flowering trees
and shrubs.</TE>
<TE>   The commission is a big leap for Taylor, so much so that she's
sensitive to charges of nepotism. Her husband, Craig Webb, is a
partner of Gehry's and co-designer on the concert hall. That's why
the tree questions started flowing her way in the first place. She
came in after a number of other designers, including Philadelphia
landscape architect Laurie Olin and Nancy Goslee Powers, who did the
Norton Simon Museum's garden, had come and gone on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Gehry spokesman Keith Mendenhall explains Taylor's selection this
way: "Basically it was Frank's choice, and he chose her." In a formal
statement, Gehry says, "We thought that this would be a wonderful
opportunity to get Melinda involved with our work and to give her a
chance to spread her wings a bit, and the collaboration really seems
to be turning out well."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor thinks she got the job precisely because she wasn't a power
landscape architect schooled in industry norms. "I've mainly done
flowering gardens," she says. "That's why Frank wanted me."</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues add that Gehry not only likes her work, he also likes
her. This 44-year-old woman is smart, funny and just a bit madcap.
Born in La Jolla, raised in the Bay Area before moving to Los Angeles
in 1980, she completed an English literature degree at UC Berkeley.
She laughs at incipient hippie tendencies, confessing, "I like
macrame!" But unlike so many Bay Area transplants, she's above taking
digs at Southern California. "I like L.A.," she says. "I find it more
architecturally arresting than the Bay Area."</TE>
<TE>   After completing a course in landscape architecture at UCLA
Extension in 1990, she has done mostly residential gardens. Her
current obsessions are the importance of public greenbelts and how to
maintain them. Ah, and sage. As she lights on Betsy Clebsch's "A Book
of Salvias" (Timber Press, $29.95) she cries, "I love this book!"</TE>
<TE>   Rather than waste any more breath defending her right to be on the
Disney project, Taylor leads a tour of some of her past work. She
drives her 10-year-old black pickup truck like she talks: Fast. As
she screeches to a halt in front of a cottage-style garden in a
well-irrigated section of Pasadena, a neighbor emerges, squinting
suspiciously.</TE>
<TE>   There's no parking there, says the neighbor, but her frown
transforms into a delighted smile as she recognizes Taylor's small,
5-foot-2 frame spring from the truck. "Hi, Melinda!" There, just
beyond Taylor's freshly laid skid marks, is a cottage garden
overflowing with roses, salvia and lavender. It is storybook lovely.</TE>
<TE>   Not far away, in a slightly more exclusive estate garden, there is
a miniaturized version of San Simeon with stately Italian cypresses
and a tiled pool. There are more delighted calls of "Hi, Melinda!" A
few guns of the engine, and the tour is in Los Feliz, where pink
tabebuia trees are now in full bloom along Virgil Avenue. The choice
of tree was hers, Taylor lets drop. The job perhaps closest to her
heart is the playground for the mid-Wilshire Pilgrim School, which
her 9-year-old son, Phineas, attends. A crop of wheat encircles the
play area. Soon the children will harvest it and make bread. "It was
deeply satisfying to do this. It's the same with the Disney garden.
It's going to mean a lot to a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Babcock, marketing director of the Music Center, says
the Disney garden is to be a new downtown public space for the entire
community, not merely for the benefit of concert-goers. "Frank has a
line," she says. "He hopes the new concert hall will be 'a living
room for the city.' Hopefully with this garden there will be a new
level of accessibility that will make everyone feel very welcome."</TE>
<TE>   In a trailer at the Disney site on Grand Avenue, Gehry partner
Terry Bell rolls out a plan of the site, showing how a series of
stairways and public walkways has been arranged to entice the public
into the $5-million garden, through its snaking gardens and to an
open-air amphitheater. There is even public access right up to an
observation window where visitors will be able to look in and see the
Los Angeles Philharmonic play.</TE>
<TE>   The garden encircles the northwestern half of the building,
spanning the length of the complex along Hope Street from 1st to 2nd
streets. Taylor leans over the map and delightedly traces a path from
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion through her garden to the Museum of
Contemporary Art. "It's the new green-space walking corridor!"</TE>
<TE>   Except it's not going to be only green, says Taylor's collaborator
on the job, landscape architect Lawrence Moline of LRM Ltd. in Culver
City. If Taylor is new to gardening around power developments, Moline
is an eminence grise. This silver-haired man is one of the city's
most senior and most respected landscape architects, his firm's
specialty that very Los Angeles art of planting over parking
structures.</TE>
<TE>   Moline explains that much of the green spaces that seem like solid
ground throughout downtown are really "captured" roof spaces above
garage space, from the new Disney Hall garden to the terraces by the
Ketchum Downtown YMCA, right down to Pershing Square. Navigating the
Disney site, Moline shows a network of 20 planters around the
concourse, many the size of backyard swimming pools, that will hold a
mixture of large trees and smaller shrubs. It was Moline's job to
make sure they were arranged artfully, drained properly and
leakproof.</TE>
<TE>   For all the engineering prowess that goes into creating these
rooftop gardens, Moline says, too often the plantings are a
predictable mix of ficus trees, grass, box hedges and azaleas. Most
developers just want to "green up" around a building, he says. "The
Walt Disney Concert Hall will be a real departure for downtown. It
will be a garden."</TE>
<TE>   That decision to put in a garden rather than "greening up" was
Gehry's, says Taylor. Gehry realized that a flowering garden might
serve as a luminous accent for the building. The steel has the
bewitching effect of changing with every nuance in light and color.</TE>
<TE>   Around 1998, he began quizzing Taylor about trees. "The biggest
component of them was they had to be flowering throughout the four
seasons," she says. She scoured the Huntington Botanical Gardens and
Arboretum of Los Angeles County and then began trawling the streets
of L.A. for the right mix. She auditioned, she reckons, 60 or so
trees. "We would take boxes of flowers and leaves to Frank's office.
We'd say, 'Frank, you can have this tree with this leaf and flower,
or this flower or this leaf and this flower,' and so on."</TE>
<TE>   They settled on six. For spring, they chose the Tabebuia
impetiginosa, the trees with lavender pink flowers that Taylor
recommended for Virgil. For spring to summer, the Erythrina
coralloides or naked coral tree with lipstick red flowers. For
summer, the Tipuana tipu or Brazilian tipu tree, with ochre flowers.
For autumn, the Pistacia chinensis, or Chinese pistache trees with a
"color play," says Taylor, from yellow to orange, red and deep red.
For late fall through winter, the Bauhinia blakeana or Hong Kong
orchid, with purple flowers and pink-flowered Dombeya cayeuxii or
pink ball dombeya.</TE>
<TE>   To this succession of color, Taylor added almost 30 types of
flowering shrubs and perennials, including five different salvias,
thyme, honeysuckle, licorice plants, and Santa Barbara daisies. Of
the tempo of the color cycle, she says, "it quiets way down for
winter, almost pink and white, very pale. In March, April, May, more
blue, white and red. In June, July, August, more maroon, and in
September, October and November, more orange and fuchsia."</TE>
<TE>   Choosing the plants was the easy part. Finding mature trees was a
great deal tougher. "We need big trees," says Taylor. "Against a
building that size, little ones would look like matchsticks." She,
Moline and plant brokers were suddenly scouring Southern California.
Six coral trees were found in an apartment complex in Marina del Rey
that was about to take them out. The Chinese pistache trees were
grown to order. For the others, it was spot the tree, take a
Polaroid, then approach the property owner and ask to buy the tree.
Taylor gives her son five bucks for every Hong Kong orchid tree he
spots.</TE>
<TE>   The only other missing ingredient is, oddly enough, broken china.
Plans for a section of the garden in honor of Lillian Disney  were
recently unveiled at a Music Center fund-raiser. "She loved Delft
china," says Taylor. "Frank wanted to do a fountain with a mosaic of
Delft china."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor herself likes the idea of a fund-raiser where everyone
donates figurines that they get to smash into mosaic-sized bits and
pieces. But, on a more serious note, she hopes that money can be
raised to hire proper gardeners, rather than mow-and-blow guys.</TE>
<TE>   The problem now is not how to keep the show going, but how to open
it when planting begins in six months. "It's the most visible project
I've ever done," says Taylor, sucking in a deep breath. She stops,
exhales, then declares with a sudden grin, "And I'm as confident as
I'm ever going to be that it's going be good."</TE>

<LD>How Is a Tulip</LD>
<LD>   Like an Onion?</LD>
<LD>   In the spring everyone delights in the arrival of beautiful
tulips. Even at the market you will find containers of these colorful
flowers. Tulips are grown from bulbs. Think about an onion, and you
will have a picture of a bulb.</LD>
<TE>   A bulb is a short underground stem with fleshy parts wrapped
around it. The bulb stores food and water to feed the new plant.
These parts are easy to see if the bulb is cut in half lengthwise.</TE>
<TE>   When a bulb is planted in soil, roots emerge from the bulb's base.
The underground stem at the center of the bulb begins to grow upward.
When it is fully grown, a flower blooms at the top of that stem. The
bulb's fleshy parts form leaves that grow upward toward the sun.
After the flower blooms, the leaves continue to make food for the
plant, and new bulbs form underground at the base of the old bulb.
These new bulbs store food to make plants the following year.</TE>
<TE>   We associate tulips with Holland, where vast fields of these
flowers are grown to produce tulip bulbs for shipment all over the
world. Tulips did not originate in Holland, however. They are native
to the mountain areas of central Asia, Turkey and southern Russia,
and arrived in Holland in the late 1500s. Tulips became very popular
flowers and their bulbs were planted in many other countries,
including the United States. Today many people think of tulips when
they think of spring.</TE>
<TE>   In March and April at Descanso Gardens, you will find beds with
thousands of tulips blooming as well as many other beautiful
spring-flowering bulbs. You might even find some onions in bloom.</TE>

<HD>When Creators Convene, It's All Eyes Toward the Future</HD>
<DH>With speakers, panels and exhibitions, the Pacific Design
Center's Westweek showcases contemporary products and ideas.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who's worked in a poorly lighted room or staggered out of a
badly designed chair or wandered like a Kafka character through an
ill-conceived building knows the value of good design. Design's
future both locally and internationally will be dissected Tuesday and
Wednesday during the Pacific Design Center's 26th annual Westweek.
For design professionals and those interested in the topic, the two
days of Westweek, which take place at the PDC, will introduce
products and ideas from around the world through panel discussions,
individual speakers and showroom exhibitions.</LD>
<TE>   Panel discussions on both days will be held in the center's
SilverScreen Theater and broadcast on wide-screen TVs throughout the
PDC. A discussion Wednesday of "The Role of Creativity in the Future
of L.A.," featuring such high-profile participants as architect Frank
Gehry, artist Edward Ruscha, developer Tom Gilmore and MOCA design
and architecture curator Brooke Hodge, among others, inevitably will
be a big draw. The topic suggests that L.A.'s creativity is not all
going into the entertainment industry. "Los Angeles is not the
one-industry town we speak of," says author Elizabeth McMillian, one
of the panel's moderators. "We've isolated 12 different industries
that, taken together, bring the greatest number of jobs and income
into the area." Two other Wednesday panels are "Traditional Design in
the 21st Century," which explores how traditional design will evolve
to keep up with the times, and "Illuminating the Future," featuring
lighting designers.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's panels include "Taking the Plunge: From Interior
Designer to Furniture Manufacturer" and "Billy Baldwin: The Eternal
Style of an American Modernist." This slide presentation by Mitchell
Owens, interior design director for Elle Decor, will trace Baldwin's
designs from the 1930s through the '70s. His clients included
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Babe Paley and Nan Kempner.</TE>
<TE>   Individual speakers include Susan S. Szenasy, editor in chief of
Metropolis magazine and consulting editor of "Design IS" (Metropolis
Books, Princeton Architecture Press, 2002). She will talk about
SmartSkin, a concept that would allow buildings to sense
environmental changes, feed shifts into a central computer and adjust
energy use, temperature and air quality accordingly--something that
Jules Verne might have envisioned. "It's not a real product yet, just
an idea induced by what we know of current technology," says Szenasy,
whose lecture is Tuesday in Studio Varenna by Poliform.</TE>
<TE>   A series of talks by architects titled "L.A. Architects Speak!"
will find Richard Landry, Ronald A. Altoon, Nicholas Roberts, Alex
Ward, Douglas Hudson and Maureen Sullivan discussing the future of
the built environment, specifically analyzing the new Cathedral of
Our Lady of the Angels downtown, the proposed Music Center renovation
and the futuristic Gate Escape Cyberports at LAX. These talks will
take place in the Blue Conference Center.</TE>
<TE>   Featured showroom exhibitions are "Design France: Generation
2001," which presents the latest in French design, and "diverCity ...
conversations in design," organized by the Southern California
Institute of Architecture, which looks at how the school relates to
its surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   "Sweden by 6" displays six contemporary designers working in
glass, wood, felt, metal, stone and porcelain. The innovative "h"
furniture by Caroline Schlyter, made of bent laminated birch, has won
acclaim in her native Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Westweek is designed for the trade, but organizers say that anyone
interested in design will not be turned away. No registration is
necessary. For information, call (310) 657-0800 or visit www.p-d-c

<LD>On the way home from school, Billy Ochoa said, "I'm going to see if
my mom can get me out of Mr. Thomas' class. He's too mean."</LD>
<LD>   Darius Miller said, "Mr. Thomas is so mean, I'm going to see if my
mom can get me out of this school."</LD>
<LD>   But when both boys came back to class the next day, Billy said,
"When I told my mom how difficult a teacher Mr. Thomas was, she said
she was going to figure out a way to get him to move up to third
grade. She wants him to be my teacher next year."</LD>
<TE>   Darius said, "My mom wants to ask Mr. Thomas if he's got a brother
so he can teach my brother. Sam is in fifth grade."</TE>

strike, they stopped working for 10 days and then their boss gave
them everything they wanted."</TE>
<TE>   "That's sure to work," Maria Lopez said. "Let's start our strike
as soon as class begins."</TE>
<TE>   "OK," Billy agreed. "Let's not do anything Mr. Thomas says. And
just before he's about to blow up, we'll tell him we're on strike.
Then he'll give us what we want. Everyone agree?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah!" they all said as they slapped hands and then filed into
class.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Thomas began the class by asking, "Will everyone take out your

his reader and turned to page 52. But he looked up sharply when he
didn't hear anyone else doing the same.</TE>

<HD>B2K Debuts Behind 'O Brother'</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After topping the nation's singles chart for nine weeks with its
snappy "Uh Huh," the Los Angeles R&amp;B-pop teen quartet B2K almost took
over the top spot this week in the album chart with its self-titled
debut collection.</LD>
<LD>   But the continuing post-Grammy surge of the "O Brother, Where Art
Thou?" soundtrack proved too great a hurdle. The country- and
bluegrass-minded package sold 149,000 copies last week, giving it a
comfortable lead over B2K, whose album sold 109,000 copies in its
first week in stores.</LD>
<LD>   The only other new collections to enter the top 30 this week are
the "Resident Evil" soundtrack, Destiny's Child's "This Is the Remix"
and the Indigo Girls' "Become You."</LD>
<TE>   Joining "O Brother" and B2K in the top 10, in order, are Alan
Jackson, Alanis Morissette, Brandy, Linkin Park, Ludacris, Pink,
Kylie Minogue and Jennifer Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Though "O Brother" had already sold nearly 4 million copies and
been in stores for more than a year, the album has enjoyed a major
sales resurgence after winning the Grammy for album of the year on
Feb. 27. It has sold more than 500,000 additional copies since then.</TE>
<TE>   B2K's "Uh Huh" single, meanwhile, has fallen to No. 3 on the
singles chart behind Mr. Cheeks' "Lights, Camera, Action!" and 'N
Sync's pairing with Nelly on "Girlfriend."</TE>

<HD>A Longing for Meaning</HD>
<DH>Singer-guitarist Eef Barzelay and his band Clem Snide try
to get beyond the superficial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eef Barzelay knows he's had it easy. The singer-guitarist for the
band Clem Snide didn't grow up during the Great Depression or serve
in Vietnam, nor does he live in Afghanistan. He comes from suburban
New Jersey, which might seem an unlikely birthplace for Clem Snide's
wistful, quietly emotional country rock.</LD>
<LD>   But as Neil Young once sang, "My problems may be meaningless, but
that don't make them go away." So Barzelay has found a personal
language that's equal parts clever and heartbreaking, singing sadly
of feeling like Elvis Presley's "long lost twin" or turning a banal
line of advertising, "Calgon, take me away," into something
impossibly sad and evocative. Elsewhere, he sings in biblical
proportions of actor Corey Feldman and mythologizes his suburban
roots on "Joan Jett of Arc," a remembrance of first love and first
sex.</LD>
<LD>   But what is sometimes interpreted as simple irony is actually a
singer-songwriter seeking common points of reference.</LD>
<TE>   "That's kind of the language that we have, commercials," says
Barzelay, 31, whose band plays tonight at the Knitting Factory
Hollywood. "Ultimately, I'm trying to make my life more meaningful,
even though it could be construed as relatively meaningless. I didn't
grow up in the ghetto. I don't have any real story. But I like the
idea of taking insignificant or superficial things and trying to make
them meaningful.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to get under people's skin, if I can," he adds. "It's warm
in there."</TE>
<TE>   That balance of dry humor and real longing can be found on the
band's most recent album, "The Ghost of Fashion." Clem Snide's sound
is rooted in the alt-country movement, but its use of strings, horns
and tape loops results in a recording often as expansive as Wilco and
other musical freethinkers.</TE>
<TE>   The musical depth helps give the unlikely lyrical content layers
of feeling. It was enough that the album's Stones-like rocker "Moment
in the Sun" was adopted as the theme to the television show "Ed."</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent appearances on "Late Night With Conan O'Brien" and
continued critical support have translated into accelerating
attention for the band. After a decade of struggle and obscurity,
Barzelay says it has been difficult to ignore the recent change in
fortunes. That much was clear at a recent show at New York's Bowery
Ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, I noticed younger people, like kids, really
into it," says Barzelay. "First you play for jaded hipsters, and if
you can transcend the jaded hipster crowd and break into the young
college kids--they're the ones that buy records and buy T-shirts.
Jaded hipsters always seem to be on the [guest] list, somehow."</TE>
<TE>   Clem Snide began after Barzelay dropped out of the prestigious
Berklee School of Music, where he studied jazz guitar. Rather than
improvising over jazz standards, he felt more inclined to draw on his
love for Hank Williams and Dinosaur Jr.</TE>
<TE>   With drummer Eric Paull and bassist Jason Glasser, he formed Clem
Snide, taking the band's name (a la Steely Dan) from a character in a
William Burroughs novel, "Cities of the Red Night." After playing
"some crazy music" in Boston for about five years, Barzelay relocated
to New York to attend art school while the band went on hiatus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clem Snide took shape again in the late '90s after Glasser
switched to cello and began experimenting with tape loops and other
sounds that would eventually add rich layers to the band's character.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone in this band is fearless and adventurous, musically, and
always wanting to see how far we can take something," says Barzelay.</TE>
<TE>   The band soon released an album, "You Were a Diamond," that earned
some favorable press, a following on the Northeast club circuit and
about 1,000 sales.</TE>
<TE>   A short-lived deal with Sire Records led to "Your Favorite Music"
(1998), now available again on the indie label SpinART, which
released "The Ghost of Fashion" last June.</TE>
<TE>   The band--which now also includes multi-instrumentalist Pete
Fitzpatrick--will break from touring this summer while Barzelay and
his wife await the birth of their first child.</TE>
<TE>   Then Clem Snide returns to the studio to make the "married with
kids record" that Barzelay says he wrote a year ago. While "The Ghost
of Fashion" represents a darker collection of "bad love songs, the
ones about love of self and lust and vanity," the sequel should be
sweeter, somehow, he promises.</TE>
<TE>   They are the "selfless, sweet kind of songs written mostly for the
wife," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   But the sound and wit should stay the same, he insists. "I kind of
get off on the irony being a Jewish kid from New Jersey who plays
country music," says Barzelay. "I think that's cool."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<LD>   Don't expect a repeat at the well-built Palace of last week's
Detroit concert by Unwritten Law and Sugarcult, when the show stopped
because the hall's floor was caving in. (Band members placated the
crowd with an impromptu acoustic set outside.) But you can expect the
two Southern California stalwarts to rock with a vengeance as they
near the end of their U.S. tour.</LD>
<LD>   Unwritten Law and Sugarcult, with Hornswaggled, the Palace, 1735
N. Vine St., Hollywood, 6 p.m. $15. (323) 462-3000. Also Wednesday at

<TE>   The Stanton Warriors' name gives a backhanded clue to the English
DJ duo's musical nature--it's taken from a make of manhole cover,
signifying the "street" vibe of their dance mix, which incorporates
such British inventions as speed garage and two-step. It's a sound
that's made the team of Dominic B. and Mark Yardley one of the
hottest arrivals in the dance world.</TE>

<TE>   William Inge's infrequently staged "Bus Stop" takes a deft hand to
manage the comic yet melancholy tale of the difficulties of love.
Under the direction of Sabin Epstein at the classic repertory company
A Noise Within, this American classic has a good chance to charm
again. The ensemble cast represents a group of travelers from Kansas
City, circa 1954, stranded by a snowstorm at a bus stop cafe. Bo, a
brash young rodeo star with matrimony on his mind, pulls out all the
stops to woo Cherie, a pretty chanteuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Bus Stop," A Noise Within, 234 S. Brand Blvd., Glendale, Friday,
8 p.m.; Saturday, 2 and 8 p.m. Also Wednesday and next Thursday,
April 19, 24-25, May 2-3, 8 p.m.; April 20, May 4, 12, 18, 2 and 8

<TE>   Don't bite that apple until you've seen "Original Sin," the latest
project by Regina Klenjoski, a contemporary choreographer whom The
Times has called "a dynamic, graceful and indefatigable presence who
appears to have it all." Working with composer Mark Fitchett and set
designer Shanan Brown, she's taken a look at the seven deadly sins
and created a seven-part vehicle for her local company. Alternately
comic, serious and abstract, her sinful vignettes depict the ways we
subconsciously internalize classic forbidden actions and feelings,
turning them into fantasies. Don McLeod appears as a guide to the
Klenjoski underworld.</TE>
<TE>   "Original Sin," Regina Klenjoski Dance Company, James Armstrong
Theatre, 3330 Civic Center Drive, Torrance, 8 p.m. Also Saturday, 8

Barry's comic, edgy look at growing up in a racially integrated urban
neighborhood in the 1960s, will be presented by the Laguna Playhouse
Youth Theatre in a production filled with pop songs of the era. It's
a child's-eye view of a changing society, but the show's not for
young children. It's recommended for ages 12 and older.</TE>
<TE>   "The Good Times Are Killing Me," Laguna Playhouse, 606 Laguna
Canyon Road, Laguna Beach, Friday, 7:30 p.m.; Saturday, 2 and 7:30

<TE>   The very first winner of the best picture Oscar in 1927, "Wings"
is a World War I aerial epic with awesome combat-flying sequences. It
may seem a trifle corny today but nonetheless retains tremendous
verve, thanks to the lusty direction of William Wellman. Army Air
Corps pals Charles "Buddy" Rogers and Richard Arlen fall in love with
the same woman, a very sexy Clara Bow as the kind of "girl next door"
you dream of, guiltily. Look for a brief but star-making appearance
by Gary Cooper. See Screening Room, Page 15.</TE>

<TE>   Although the insatiability of cable TV has been a boon to
documentarians the world over, like most filmmakers they'd prefer an
audience see their work projected on a large screen in a dark room.
For the 20th year, the International Documentary Assn. affords
filmgoers that opportunity during DocuDay, a daylong showcase for the
five Oscar-nominated features as well as the three films up for the
short documentary award. The eight films represent a true world of
cinema; their settings range from the Mississippi Delta to the
embattled streets of Jerusalem, and they deal with such topics as
war, racism and the uplifting power of music.</TE>

<TE>   With thousands of people moving to Los Angeles County each year
and few new housing units being built, a citywide crisis is brewing.
See some of the ideas for solutions-- including prototypes for
multi-unit urban housing--at the daylong conference Beyond Sprawl:
New Strategies and Prototypes for Housing. The morning focuses on
city planning issues, including a keynote address by Thom Mayne,
principal architect at the firm Morphosis. The afternoon is dedicated
to architectural models. The setting might provide some inspiration
as well: The Southern California Institute of Architecture, or
SCI-Arc, is a remarkable converted train depot east of the downtown
Civic Center.</TE>

<TE>   The 10 young members of WOFA! Percussion and Dance From Guinea,
West Africa, have mastered such traditional instruments as the kyrin
(a wooden drum in the shape of a tree trunk), the square sikko drum
and the wassakhoumba (small calabash dishes, strung onto a curved
stick, that produce high-pitched sounds when shaken). Praised by The
Times in 1998 for its "creatively arranged and staged" pieces in an
"intimate, nuanced performance," the group is directed by Francois
Kokelaere, himself a master drummer. And in case you're curious,
wofa! means "let's go" in the performers' Soso dialect.</TE>
<TE>   WOFA! Percussion and Dance From Guinea, West Africa, Beckman

by designer Gerald Scarfe. It's the type of staging, The Times' Mark
Swed wrote at the time, that relies a lot on its singers. Taking up
that challenge are Rodney Gilfry as the bird catcher Papageno and
Sumi Jo, who will play the scheming Queen of the Night in Mozart's
classic. Also making their Los Angeles Opera debuts are soprano
Andrea Rost (Pamina) and basso Reinhard Hagen (Sarastro).</TE>

an extended question-and-answer session and then see one of the
pieces again for extra insights. Sunday's session includes
"Bloomers!," a happy women's quartet to music by Vasen, and "A Few
American Songs," a suite of dramatic solos and duets to 19th century
folk music. This is Bike's first season as dance coordinator of the

<TE>   Expat British filmmaker Alex Cox gained a cult following with a
pair of hip mid-1980s films, "Repo Man" and "Sid and Nancy." Both
films, screening Sunday through Tuesday at the New Beverly, revel in
their punk attitudes while serving up cheeky social commentary. Harry
Dean Stanton plays mentor to Emilio Estevez's repo-man-in-training in
Cox's 1984 sci-fi satire. In "Sid and Nancy," Cox blends bleak
docu-realism with disturbing dream imagery to create a riveting
portrayal of doomed Sex Pistol Sid Vicious (Gary Oldman) and his
groupie-turned-girlfriend Nancy Spungeon (Chloe Webb).</TE>

<LD>   Sifting through a thrift store in 1987, artist and sometime movie
director Julian Schnabel came upon a small painting of a girl that
inspired his latest show, "Big Girl Paintings," opening today at
Gagosian Gallery. Using that classic, clean-cut American image as a
starting point, Schnabel painted 13 large-scale girls, then deleted
the eyes of each with one long, broad stroke. The artist has
explained that this loss of sight is meant to force the viewer to
look beyond the eyes and examine each painting as a whole.</LD>
<LD>   "Julian Schnabel: Big Girl Paintings," Gagosian Gallery, 456 N.
Camden Drive, Beverly Hills. Tuesdays to Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5:30
p.m. Free. Ends May 4. A reception for the artist will be held today

<TE>   Paddy Chayefsky's "Middle of the Night" has always attracted top
talent. Written in 1954 for NBC's "The Philco Television Playhouse,"
the play went on to a 1956 Broadway run with Edward G. Robinson and
Gena Rowlands. Frederic March and Kim Novak were the May-December
lovers in the 1959 film version. Now John Rubinstein directs a new
version of the story, a romantic drama about a middle-age man and his
neurotic 24-year-old secretary. Elliott Gould, Carol Kane, Amy Pietz
and Kenneth Alan Williams star in the live radio theater production

<TE>   The Baseball Reliquary has made it its mission to preserve the

outright lies. For the organization's All-Star Baseball Comedy
Benefit, a full lineup of comics will take a swing at our national
pastime, including Fred Willard, Jack Riley and Ed Crasnick. Here's
the funniest thing of all: The money will go toward the construction
of an inedible cake replica of Ebbets Field.</TE>

director of Cirque du Soleil since 1988. More than 30 horses of 17
distinct breeds (Spanish, Belgian, Russian, Arabian and others) will
perform within a multi-peaked round tent hand-painted on the outside
to look like a castle in the Loire Valley of France. Acrobats,

<LD>Still catching my breath from Flogging Molly's sold-out, three-night
run at the Troubadour last week. Man, last time there was so much
excitement about a band with so much soul, Ozomatli was in the
house....Wiggled my way into the Lounge on Thursday and watched actor
David Alan Grier roll in with a bevy of babes....Speaking of babes,
ex-Otep members and the former drummer of Godhead just debuted their
new band, Awkward, at the Viper Room. By the sounds of it, they're
anything but.... I'm gonna roll on down to the Palms Casino in Vegas
for a triple-header by Royal Crown Revue, which is playing at the new
casino on March 28-30...."Bowl A Rama" is set for April 6 at the All
Star Lanes in Eagle Rock, with performances by Mr. Bad Wrench, Luck
of the Draw, Crank Williams and the Deadbillies.</LD>
<LD>   Had a lovely dinner last week at Moomba, a favorite spot for
L.A.'s power brokers. Chanced upon that gorgeous dame Cameron Diaz at
the Parlour hair salon in WeHo. She's even hotter without makeup.
Speaking of hot dames, ran into Minnie Driver at the Goodform beauty
parlor in Hollywood.... Had the good fortune of meeting artist Gris
Grimly at the Shamrock Social Club. Grimly illustrated my son's
favorite book, "Monster Museum."</LD>
<TE>   The Troub' says Autolux and Ima Robot are playing April 1. Ima be
there for sure.... Crashed Tuesday night's opening party for Royal

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wandering from bar to bar, looking for love--it seemed for a time
that Ronnie Mack's Barn Dance might become a country music cliche.
But after a few years of rootlessness, the Barn Dance settled into
Crazy Jack's in Burbank about a year ago, and it's beginning to feel
like home.</LD>
<LD>   At a 14th anniversary show in January, Crazy Jack's was packed
with the Barn Dance faithful, a not-so-L.A. mix of fringe-jacketed
women who can really drink, ponytailed 60-year-old cowboys,
rockabilly young 'uns and their gussied-up girlfriends. They
converged seamlessly with Crazy Jack's slightly more mainstream
country crowd of mullet-sporting line dancers and their
fortysomething tattooed wives. It was a little bit of Texas in the
middle of Burbank, cultivated by Barn Dance impresario Ronnie Mack.</LD>
<LD>   "That place had been aligned with line dancing and karaoke," says
Mack, "but it's also got a lot going for it. It has a great dance
floor and Jack's a nice guy. He begged me to bring it there." Mack, a
tall, chatty fellow who often wears sweatsuits while hosting the Barn
Dance, is one of the L.A. country scene's most respected figures
because of his impeccable taste and especially his warm and
infinitely friendly demeanor.</LD>
<TE>   His Barn Dance was key in fostering an authentic, down-home
environment for local roots music acts to flourish, while launching
numerous careers. Lucinda Williams crooned some of her first lovely
notes on the Barn Dance stage, and Dave Alvin, Rosie Flores, James
Intveld and Big Sandy are all regulars. There's still probably no
better spot in L.A. for seeing veterans like Glen Glenn, Ray Campi,
Jimmy Angel and honking blues saxophonist Big Jay McNeely, musicians
who may have fallen off the radar a bit, but who are as riveting live
as wild rattlesnakes.</TE>
<TE>   Mack hesitated before moving his Barn Dance to Crazy Jack's. Part
sports bar (seven or eight TV screens show NBA highlights, no matter
what's on stage) and part country-western saloon, the club has little
in the way of decor other than bull horns, Budweiser posters, plenty
of mirrors and a lonely disco ball. The tables and chairs look as if
they might have been borrowed from a church community center. Yet
it's a big ol' place with a dance floor, seemingly perfect for the
Barn Dance.</TE>
<TE>   Though he's now comfortable in the new digs, Mack is less
enthusiastic about Southern California's country scene in general.
He's scaled his show back from weekly to monthly, in part, he said,
because the scene is dwindling.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still those people, the Dave Alvins, the Rosies and the
Lucindas," says Mack, "but there isn't a new Lucinda or a new Dave
Alvin, and if there are, people don't really know about it yet."</TE>
<TE>   Mack, an exceptional guitarist and songwriter, always put his own
music on the back burner, but he's started giving it more attention
and recently recorded an album's worth of power pop tunes. He's
worked for 25 years at the Tinder Box, a pipe and tobacco store in
Santa Monica, while devoting endless unpaid hours to county music.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if it wasn't for Ronnie Mack and his passion about
keeping the roots and California country scene alive, then there
probably wouldn't even be a scene in L.A.," says Barn Dance regular
Rosie Flores, who now lives in Nashville. "I've never met a more
dedicated person. He's put forth not only his time and his effort,
but his money to keep the Barn Dance alive."</TE>
<TE>   The Barn Dance kicked off in 1988 as a radio show on KCSN, the Cal
State Northridge station, broadcasting live from the Little Nashville
club in North Hollywood. When it outgrew that now-defunct venue, it
moved to the more spacious and famed Palomino nearby, and kept up
even after KCSN became a classical music station.</TE>
<TE>   The Barn Dance found a comfy home at the Palomino and later Jack's
Sugar Shack, often drawing sellout crowds. Among the luminaries who
dropped in and performed were Emmylou Harris, Dwight Yoakam and Mary
Chapin Carpenter.</TE>
<TE>   "Bruce Springsteen came in with a friend of his and stayed for
three hours," recalls Mack. "At the end of the night, after the Barn
Dance show is over, I have an open jam and he came up and sang some
harmonies and played guitar with our house band. So I just played a
Little Richard song and a Willie Dixon blues tune, and we were all
trading off guitar solos. So that was a thrill."</TE>
<TE>   While today's Barn Dance isn't always as electrifying as the Barn
Dance of the Palomino era, nobody would want to imagine a Los Angeles
where new country artists attempting to eschew the oversized cowboy
hat image had to battle it out for booking in L.A. clubs, where
country music is generally as foreign as Nepalese flute music.
Rather, the cozy Barn Dance stage is a necessity for young musicians,
as well as a venue for honoring country music's pioneers.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things about the Barn Dance that I've always done is
to remember a lot of the legends that aren't around anymore," says
Mack, "and do a whole tribute night to them. I mean Hank Williams is
one of the greatest legends of country music, but even on his
birthday a station like KZLA would never even consider taking two
minutes to play one of his songs, because they think something like
that would offend their listeners' ears or something. I just always
hope that there should be room for all types of music and everything
should be given a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Ronni Mack hosts a benefit for the daughter of the late Jeff
Roberts with Randy Weeks, Cisco, Robbie Rist, Bastard Sons of Johnny
Cash, and more, Sunday 3-7 p.m. at Crazy Jack's, 4311 Magnolia Blvd.,
Burbank. The next Barn Dance, a Waylon Jennings and Tammy Wynette
tribute, is April 2, 8:30 p.m. at Crazy Jack's. Free. (818) 845-1121.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The north Indian city of Jaipur is a madhouse of frenzied
traffic--rickshaws, bicycles and heavily laden camels charging toward
their destinations. Jaipur Cuisine of India in Los Angeles is just
the opposite: a serene place to meet on the Westside for a quiet
dinner. The food is good and not jarringly spicy, the service
thoughtful but unobtrusive. Curries are set over candles to keep them
hot until eaten. Bowls of fresh fruit accompany desserts.</LD>
<LD>   Because of its rosy buildings, India's Jaipur is known as the pink
city. L.A.'s Jaipur is pink too. The walls are painted a subdued tone
that gives off a pleasant glow, while the white trim and white
ceiling fans make the room look cool and fresh. Only the glittery
Rajasthani wall hangings and a few knickknacks indicate that this is
an Indian restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   The menu echoes most other north Indian menus around town, but the
dishes are well-prepared. You can appreciate the spices in the
eggplant dish began bharta: cinnamon and cumin, blended with onion,
ginger and turmeric.</LD>
<TE>   The unusual bhindi (sliced okra) is flavored with vinegar, black
salt and mango powder. The delicately seasoned fish tikka kebab
remains juicy and tender despite having been roasted in a hot tandoor
oven because the fish is Chilean sea bass. There is also a superior
dish of Chilean sea bass in a velvety tomato-cream makhanwala sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the usual reddish tandoori chicken, chicken reshmi kebab
retains its natural color. The white meat tastes slightly tangy,
rather than spicy, from its yogurt marinade. (The chicken curry, on
the other hand, is not exceptional.)</TE>
<TE>   The tandoori rack of lamb isn't bad, but it also isn't much meat
for the money, just three chops. Lamb tikka is probably a wiser
choice, or mutton sohitya, a curry that combines lamb and corn
kernels in a tomato, onion and bell pepper sauce. (Despite the name,
this dish is made with lamb, not the usual Indian mutton, which is
goat meat.)</TE>
<TE>   An exceptionally good appetizer is shami kebab--two small fried
patties of ground lamb and pureed yellow lentils. Amazingly light and
crisp, they're irresistible. Unfortunately, one order is not enough
for a group.</TE>
<TE>   Jaipur has plenty of options for vegetarians, including lentils,
dishes made with Indian cheese (paneer), a vegetable pilaf (biryani)
and combinations such as mushrooms with peas or potatoes with
cauliflower. Big chunks of cheese, tomatoes and bell pepper are
skewered and plunged into the tandoor for a vegetable shashlik.
Rather than ordering these dishes separately, a lone diner can ask
for the assorted platter called vegetarian thali. Other dinner
combinations cater to meat eaters.</TE>
<TE>   Plain basmati rice is best with curries. Ornate pullaos and
biryanis go well with grilled foods. The Kashmiri pullao embellished
with fruit and nuts sounds intriguing, but it's not up to the
standard of other dishes here. The nuts are scarce and the fruits
look to me like a canned mix.</TE>
<TE>   The large selection of Indian breads ranges from plain naan to
naan stuffed with lamb and spinach and onion kulcha. Kabuli naan,
filled with cashews and raisins, is almost a sweet pastry, rather
than a bread.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from kulfi (ice cream), there are just three desserts, all
made on the premises. Jaipur's khir (rice pudding) is as fluid as
soup. It's seasoned with saffron and cardamom and dusted with chopped
pistachios. The bowl of red grapes on the side is a nice touch,
although grapes don't have much in common with rice pudding.</TE>
<TE>   Fruit--usually grapes but sometimes mangoes, depending on the
season--also comes with gulab jamun (fried balls of milk dough served
hot in a cardamom-flavored syrup) and rasmalai (clotted milk
sprinkled with pistachios).</TE>
<TE>   Jaipur offers wines as well as Indian beers, the yogurt drink
lassi and masala chai. On weekdays the restaurant sets up a lunch
buffet that is convenient for shoppers at the Westside Pavilion next
door. The buffet moves up in class to a champagne lunch on weekends.</TE>

of the Westside Pavilion). (310) 470-4994. Lunch 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.

<LD>Most of the famous shopping districts in Los Angeles operate on the
principles of cachet and exclusivity. Not Santee Alley, the
sweltering, swarming marketplace at the heart of downtown's Fashion
District, which has more in common with a Moroccan souk than Sunset
Plaza.</LD>
<LD>   Call it a melting pot or a salad bowl, Santee Alley is one of the
places in this vast, fractious city where people of all backgrounds
meet and mingle, buying one another's wares, checking out one
another's outfits and literally stepping on one another's toes.</LD>
<LD>   It's loud, it's dirty and it's far from home for anyone but a
handful of loft-dwellers. The goods run the gamut from cheap to dirt
cheap, and virtually the only "quality" items are knockoffs.</LD>
<TE>   The bargains are legendary. But Santee Alley isn't just about
bargains; it's about inclusion. As on the Champs Elysee in Paris, you
can stand in one spot and see the whole city pass by: There goes a
tall, curvaceous blond woman in a shocking pink tie-dyed mini-dress,
teetering on platform heels while she coos at a hatchling box turtle
in a plastic cage that she bought from a street vendor for $5. Here
comes a hatchet-faced and weather-beaten elderly man dressed like a
vaquero in cowboy boots and a straw hat, dripping with dignity and
gravely carrying his sole purchase--a pastel baby stroller. Suddenly,
a willowy woman in brilliant gold and black print African robes and
tribal jewelry, her head shaved bald, double-parks a red Mercedes and
climbs out. She waits, leaning on the hood, while a man in a charcoal
business suit hops out and dashes into the throng, evidently pursuing
a quick purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile a shy-looking woman stands elevated on an overturned
milk crate in the alley's entrance, selling colored contact lenses
for $11 a pair.</TE>
<TE>   Another street vendor, a middle-aged woman who speaks only
Spanish, sells slices of papaya and mango from a box slung around her
neck. "Come inside! Take a look! Oh my God! Oh my goodness!" barks
Jose Carillo from Mexico City, perched on a stepladder so that he can
dominate the crowd at the entrance to Tina USA, a narrow alley-front
shop selling stretch pants in loud prints and skimpy crepe tops.
"Everything under five dollars!" He grins and claps, keeping a rhythm
to his exuberant patter.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday is the busiest day of Santee Alley's week, but on any
given weekend the pilgrims include bargain-hunting San Marino
housewives like Meg Synes, who took her 12-year-old daughter and her
friends to buy bootleg Kate Spade handbags for Easter, and shoppers
from Pico Rivera, like Pressie Menendez, a licensed vocational nurse
who brought her husband and children along to shop for a fancy white
dress for her daughter's first communion.</TE>
<TE>   These are people who don't go to the same supermarkets or movie
theaters, who probably don't even share the same freeways most of the
time, but here they are. They're drawn by what few of them realize is
one of the most successful and diverse business communities in
Southern California and a quiet urban renewal success story.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Tina USA, Donna McCollins, an information technology
professional who lives in Westchester, is trying to look at the
clothes and at the same time keep an eye on her 7-year-old daughter,
Jada, a gangly, excited, smiling young shopper in an electric blue
T-shirt and braided pigtails. A teenage niece who lives with
McCollins is roaming the alley with a girlfriend. For McCollins, the
alley provides a day's entertainment and a cheap way to clothe a
houseful of fashion-conscious females.</TE>
<TE>   "Pants, skirts, tops, toys, turtles," McCollins says, "you name
it, I've bought it here."</TE>
<TE>   Across the alleyway, Gail Ma, a schoolteacher, and her boyfriend,
Malcolm O'Donnell, are trying on knockoff Oakley sunglasses. "I can
wear these on the golf course," O'Donnell says. "Who's gonna know?"</TE>
<TE>   "We just had dim sum in Chinatown, and now we're looking for
purses and accessories," Gail's sister, Tina Ma explains over the
din. She is carrying a gray Kate Spade handbag--a real one, not one
of the imitations for sale at a tenth the price a few booths down,
she notes ruefully.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly they're out to soak up the carnival atmosphere, and to
show Gail Ma, from Palm Springs, a bit of the "real" Los Angeles.
"This is so fun!" Tina Ma exclaims, laughing, even as the three are
pinned to the sunglass stand by the press of the throng, which is
momentarily gridlocked. "It's so incredibly crowded! But my God, what
an interesting place!" Then the Ma sisters are swept away on the
tide, and O'Donnell hurries to catch up. "They're both short, and I
don't want to lose them!" he cries.</TE>
<TE>   Most everyone who ventures into Santee Alley for the first time
feels he or she has discovered it as surely as Marco Polo discovered
spaghetti. What usually happens when people start to repeatedly
"discover" a neighborhood is that gentrification can't be far behind.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, one major residential-retail project is already in
the works. Santa Monica-based MJW Investments recently announced
plans to issue Fannie Mae-backed bonds to finance a
790,000-square-foot retail and residential development at the
intersection of Santee and 8th streets.</TE>
<TE>   But the character of Santee Alley isn't likely to change any time
soon, even if the surrounding area becomes a residential hot spot.
For starters, Starbucks probably couldn't afford the rent.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know how much I pay for this space?" Joseph Yamini, owner
of Orly Fashion says incredulously as he sits behind the cash
register in his narrow shotgun retail space filled with men's and
women's sportswear. "Eleven thousand dollars a month! It's as much
per square foot as Rodeo Drive!"</TE>
<TE>   He's not far off. While rents on Rodeo Drive hover around $18 to
$20 per square foot, rents on Santee Alley--$10 per square foot--are
higher than downtown Beverly Hills; on Beverly Drive for instance,
the average is $6 to $7. That's because foot traffic and sales in the
alley justify the premium lease rates. Rent is Yamini's biggest
expense, but Santee Alley has been good to him. He's been a tenant
for 17 years and does well enough to own a house in Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   For all its rough edges, this is a rundown neighborhood with a
thriving economy, and it's been that way for years. Santee Alley got
its start in the '70s, when the wholesalers lining Maple and Santee
streets started selling production overruns and lines dropped by
department stores out of the backs of their wholesale showrooms on
weekends.</TE>
<TE>   The experiment was so successful that eventually the showrooms'
orientations turned completely around, so that the alleyway became
the new front door. The alley is still the ultimate prestige address,
but the Fashion District now encompasses 82 blocks, with more than
1,000 retail outlets doing $1 billion in business with the public
each year (wholesale sales for the fashion district total $7
billion). The garment business is Southern California's third-largest
industry, behind movies and aerospace/technology, and this is its
epicenter.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, 85% of the businesses here are mom and pop stores with
fewer than five employees. It's almost like shopping in an
international Mayberry. "We have a wide cross-section of business
owners, ethnically," says Kent Smith, executive director of the
Fashion District Business Improvement District. "There is a strong
Middle Eastern contingent, a strong Korean contingent, the Jewish
community has been here for many years and there's a growing Latino
entrepreneurial presence. We've become the fusion place."</TE>
<TE>   Born of the collision of so many traditions, the business culture
of Santee Alley takes a wild and woolly frontier-town approach to the
marketplace. Many vendors and retailers operate on--well, let's just
politely call it the "cutting edge" of legal commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The small bootleg operators who are selling knockoff shoes,
handbags and toys know that anyone caught with fewer than 1,000
illegal items is charged with only a misdemeanor instead of a felony.
While Kate Spade and Tommy Hilfiger surely don't appreciate such
cavalier attitudes, the merchants take the occasional minor bust in
stride. And larger retailers may sell bootleg goods, but they usually
pay the sales tax on them.</TE>
<TE>   It may not look like it from street-level, but there is order amid
the chaos. Because of this sense of order and purpose, the alley is
thriving even through the recession.</TE>
<TE>   Retail sales in the fashion district did drop somewhat after Sept.
11, but the Fashion District Business Improvement District reports
that the district's 2001 holiday shopping season topped the previous
year's, and 2002 is shaping up to be the district's best year yet.</TE>
<TE>   "We're adding 200 stores a year," says Smith. "And the pedestrian
traffic on Santee Alley easily rivals that of Hollywood Boulevard or
the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica."</TE>
<TE>   The cavalier attitudes toward trademarks and licenses don't extend
to dealings with customers, who are generally treated well. You
aren't likely to get ripped off here or suffer any kind of villainy
at the hands of the locals. After all, this level of easy prosperity
means that the sidewalk vendor selling bootleg Gucci wallets or $15
pet iguanas is only a bootstrap removed from the established
storefront operator, and no one wants to scare off business from the
area.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst problem we have is with the illegal food vendors,"
Smith says. "I've seen them cutting up fruit in public restrooms.
It's important to get the word out to consumers about that."</TE>
<TE>   The area has experienced a subtle form of urban rejuvenation since
the downtown property owners formed a Business Improvement District
in 1995. The group's first action was to rename the Garment District
the Fashion District, making it sound less commercial and more
consumer-friendly. Then it began to apply a $2.8-million budget,
funded exclusively with dues collected from property owners, to
provide extra trash collection, graffiti removal and security,
including bicycle and foot patrols and a pickpocket detail that makes
citizen's arrests. The result is an area that retains its raw, unique
character but is in fact not unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a 53% decrease in crime since we started our security
details in 1996," says Smith. "It's one of the safest places in the
city. You're as safe as you are in Beverly Hills."</TE>
<TE>   Still, favorable statistics have done little so far to change the
perception of lawlessness shared by many out-of-area visitors, whose
only prior experience with bargain shopping may be a trip to Costco
and who have driven through Skid Row, only a few blocks away, to get
here.</TE>
<TE>   Bride-to-be Shavon Pennington of Bakersfield, who looks like
Marcia from "The Brady Bunch," emerges from D&amp;R Fashions, where she
has just ordered her bridesmaids' gowns, and stops to ponder the
wallets and trinkets that Indian emigre Khadija Motiwala is selling
from a folding table. Pennington's mother, Cheryl, follows close
behind, carrying her new mother-of-the-bride dress in a garment bag,
looking flushed and cheery.</TE>
<TE>   "We were here yesterday," Cheryl says. "It was so great, we drove
all the way back today. I got this dress for $139, down from $189. I
bargained for it," she adds breathlessly. "I love this even more than
the outlet malls."</TE>
<TE>   She lowers her voice. "But don't be down here past dark, we got
caught yesterday, and it was a little bit scary."</TE>
<TE>   To combat these perceptions, D&amp;R Fashions has aggressively sought
to expand its retail clientele by hosting shopping seminars.</TE>
<TE>   "Our main clientele is church women, who attend church every
Sunday, so they need to buy a lot of formal dresses," explains sales
manager Mary Green. "We have groups of women coming from as far away
as Sacramento. We bring them in, have an event at a local restaurant
and teach them everything they need to know to navigate their way
through the downtown shopping experience."</TE>
<TE>   A shopping trip so arduous it requires a course of study will
never be everyone's cup of tea, of course, but that's what makes
Santee Alley such a distinctive attraction.</TE>
<TE>   It is a bustling center of day-to-day commerce, but it's also one
of the highlights of L.A.'s shopping underground, a scene that's more
about word-of-mouth on the best flea markets and thrift stores than
Presidents Day sales and shopping malls.</TE>
<TE>   For those who see shopping as an extreme sport, Santee Alley is a
kind of Mt. Everest.</TE>
<TE>   Winter Rosebud, who designs custom bras and corsets for Trashy
Lingerie in Los Angeles, lives just around the corner and is one of
the area's hard-core denizens. She agrees that shopping Santee is a
learned art.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely have my favorite shops. There are so many stores
it's impossible to find the good ones in a day unless you know where
to look. I know where to get everything, and I go at 9 a.m., when no
one is there."</TE>
<TE>   She warms to her subject as she contemplates the big game lurking
in the alley's byways (there's a reason it's called "bargain hunting"
and not "bargain gathering").</TE>
<TE>   "There are places where you can get rhinestones, fabulous leather
coats, zoot suits, African dashikis, things that you can't find
anywhere [else] in L.A. You just have to know where to look."</TE>
<TE>   But even if you hate to shop, Santee Alley has depths to plumb. An
afternoon in its environs can give you a glimpse of the changing face
of the city, a place where lively trade and cooperative efforts
between unlike individuals creates an organic sense of community no
amount of city planning can achieve.</TE>
<TE>   Santee Alley has a bit of something for everyone, whether it's
pursuing the American dream from a prime spot on the street corner,
managing a million-dollar enterprise tucked into a tiny piece of real
estate or simply scoring 10 pairs of socks for $5.</TE>

<HD>Ten Spots Right Up Her Alley</HD>

<LD>Winter Rosebud is a fabulous creature of fashion, a blond vision in
vinyl, fur, leather and studs, all of which she purchased in Santee
Alley, along with her cowboy hat. She is a staff designer at Trashy
Lingerie in Los Angeles, where she designs custom bras and corsets
six days a week. She lives in a loft around the corner from Santee
Alley and regularly trolls the shops for ideas and materials. Once in
a while, she even sees a knockoff of one of her designs in a store
window. Here's Rosebud's take on her favorites:</LD>
<LD>   1. Axxent, 1008-A S. Santee St. Rhinestone jewelry, belts,
handbags, everything 50% off the marked price. "Rhinestone brooches
are really happening right now; they're my latest obsession. And
they've been right here all along. And you see this Mongolian lamb
purse? You can buy it at Fred Segal for $400. Here it's $30. And it's
real."</LD>
<LD>   2. Bon Jour, 1008-B S. Santee St.  More jewelry, belts, bags, at
50% discount. "If you're ever in need of a rhinestone bra and
miniskirt, you can get them here. You can also buy your aunt a fur
scarf and she'll think you won the lottery!"</LD>
<TE>   3. Something Special, 1014 S. Santee St. The place to buy every
kind of cowboy hat imaginable, and rhinestone-encrusted sunglasses.
"Elton John glasses ... or are you looking for a hot pink snakeskin
cowboy hat?"</TE>
<TE>   4. Too-Too Hat Co., 10161/2 S. Santee St. Owner Sunny Pak supplies
feather- and spangle-bedecked fancy hats to a clientele of women who
like to get all dolled up for church. "This place makes you want to
have a tea party."</TE>
<TE>   5. Yessi, 11041/2 S. Santee St. (in the alley). Women's fashions.
"This is my all-time favorite store in the alley. All these little
hippie blouses are still on the runway. I don't know how they figure
out how to make them so fast. They have the best jeans too. And
everything's around $15."</TE>
<TE>   6. Classic Wear, 1140 S. Santee St. (in the alley). Men's
fashions, shoes and hats, specializing in colorful zoot suits and
matching suede and patent leather shoes. "Aren't these pimp suits
cute? There's a crack hotel across the street from my loft, and the
guys get out of their Corvettes dressed just like this. They're
popular with costume designers too." 7. Jenico Shoes, 1154 S. Santee
St. (runs from street to the alley). From denim boots to Lucite
platform slides, many pairs are two for $15. "This is the place I
come to buy boots. On the street side, they have a lot of stripper
shoes too."</TE>
<TE>   8. Next Accessories, 1136-C S. Santee St. For clip-on hairpieces
in every shade and texture. "The thing to do is to get two and wear
them on each side of your head as big ponytails. I've gone through
several pairs of these. I've worn them to the Playboy Mansion a
couple of times. I ruined some in a Jacuzzi once."</TE>
<TE>   9. Ocean Blue, 310 11th St. "The only place downtown to buy a
bikini."</TE>
<TE>   10. Alley Dogs, corner of Santee Alley and 12th Street. "The Alley
Dog is legendary. It's a big, fat hot dog wrapped in bacon, with
grilled onions and peppers and covered in mayonnaise. I love to eat
them for breakfast."</TE>

<LD>SAN FRANCISCO--Jack's, the historic San Francisco chophouse that
dates from 1864, has a new owner. He's Philippe Jeanty, the French
native who led the kitchen at Domaine Chandon in the Napa Valley
until a few years ago when he opened his own place, Jeanty's, in
Yountville. His cooking went from haute to bistro fare and his fans
followed.</LD>
<LD>   Now he's turned the restaurant that withstood the great San
Francisco earthquake and fire into Jeanty at Jack's. The narrow,
four-story building on Sacramento Street in the heart of the
financial district was coveted by a number of restaurateurs, but
Jeanty got the prize.</LD>
<LD>   It's a wonderful space, with a small bar at the far end,
banquettes downstairs, a mezzanine with tables overlooking the action
and more seating upstairs, including several private rooms.</LD>
<TE>   I'm a huge fan of Jeanty's and so couldn't wait to try the new
place. Waiting at the bar for our table some 45 minutes, I watched a
table of four women seated at a banquette pass plates back and forth
with gusto. The oysters from Point Reyes up the coast disappeared in
the blink of an eye. Then came a coarse rabbit pate and frisee salad
with bacon and a poached egg, the way they like to serve it in Lyon.
One woman kept digging her fork into the oval casserole that held
crusty gratin dauphinois. I made a mental note to order that. And the
cassoulet served in a deep terracotta bowl. This they totally
demolished, leaving only a thin ring of breadcrumbs at the edge of
the bowl.</TE>
<TE>   To start, I had the pieds de cochons persilles, basically
parsleyed pigs' feet served cold with its wonderful gelee and a few
green beans. Now that's a real bistro dish. Someone else at the table
had the foie gras au torchon, a small, thick slab of rosy foie gras
rimmed with delicious yellow fat. We each got a bite of it on warm
toasted brioche. And we shared the mustardy potato and lamb's tongue
salad I remember from Jeanty's in Napa Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The cassoulet, when it came, was everything it should be. The
beans had soaked up so much flavor from the duck confit,
coarse-textured pork sausage and applewood smoked bacon, I could have
happily just eaten that. They were juicy and fork-tender, redolent of
garlic and those wonderful meats. To get at it, you had dig through a
fragrant coverlet of buttery breadcrumbs and parsley. Outside, it was
gusty and cold, perfect cassoulet weather. Needless to say, we didn't
leave a bite. And we never made it to dessert.</TE>

<LD>The ornately painted fold-out stage might have sprung from the pages
of an antique pop-up book, the Prince is so shy he does magic tricks
to compensate and Cinderella levitates: When Landis &amp; Company Theatre
of Magic is in town, it's never fairy tale theater as usual.</LD>
<LD>   "Cinderella," the Philadelphia-based company's latest national
touring show, is making stops at the Haugh Performing Arts Center in
Glendora on Saturday, Carpenter Performing Arts Center in Long Beach
on Sunday and the McCallum Theatre in Palm Springs on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A poignant and funny telling of the familiar tale, it weaves
together stylized physical theater, magic, music and visual treats,
with an aim to appeal to adults as well as children ages 6 and up.</LD>
<TE>   And, as in the similarly staged "Beauty and the Beast," which the
company toured here two years ago, "Cinderella" features an unusual
cast: actors that never speak, their faces concealed by puppet-like
masks, playing opposite eccentric, life-size puppets.</TE>
<TE>   The puppets, including buffoonish stepsisters and a rather
alarming stepmother, are manipulated by dark-garbed actor-puppeteers
who also move props and scenery and play other characters in the
show, from ball guests to the lizard-turned-coachman and
mouse-turned-horse.</TE>
<TE>   With vivid period costumes, a romantic, Prokofiev-inspired score
and an evocative lighting design in soft pastels and swirling
patterns, the rags-to-riches story unfolds through limited recorded
narration and the actors' tightly choreographed movement.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is to [express] through the body very clear ideas,"
said artistic director Landis Smith, "so that you almost think
they're talking."</TE>
<TE>   Gail Grigg, "an extraordinary physical actress" and alumna of
Northern California's respected Dell'Arte International School of
Physical Theatre, is the person behind the wistful Cinderella mask.
Unable to use face or voice to communicate, she portrays a full range
of emotion using her body to create what she calls "mobile
sculpture."</TE>
<TE>   Her performance, Smith said, takes the language of movement
further than in "Beauty and the Beast."</TE>
<TE>   "You think it's mechanics," he said, "but associated with those
mechanics are feelings and ideas. In some ways, the body can be more
eloquent than words."</TE>
<TE>   "There are certainly elements of mime, which is almost a
four-letter word," Grigg noted wryly. "I think that's why we say
'physical theater,' because everyone's afraid of the 'm' word."</TE>
<TE>   Working with a mask, however, opens a wealth of options for an
actor, she said. "You're not limited by your type or your age. It's
about figuring out how different parts of your body are displayed, or
if you're reaching forward in a certain way, how does it read [to the
audience]? It's through that extreme technicality that you get those
moments when you're someone else."</TE>
<TE>   Because there is limited narration, the central expressive "voice"
of the play is provided by composer Andy Tierstein, whose work
includes many PBS and BBC films. His classical score reflects the
play's origins: It began as a short musical pantomime piece
commissioned by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, choreographed to a
suite from Prokofiev's "Cinderella" ballet.</TE>
<TE>   This "Cinderella" is unexpected in other ways. According to Smith,
director Leslie Reidel, who wrote the script with Smith and his wife,
Jennifer Blatchley Smith, "dug deep" in researching the tale, which
appears in 9th century China and many other cultures.</TE>
<TE>   It begins with a "subtle" dying scene, as Cinderella's
mother--another life-size puppet--says her last goodbye to her
daughter and husband. The Prince departs from his usual role, too,
not only wooing Cinderella with card tricks and other playful bits of
magic, but traveling around the world to find her, and encountering
Spanish, Balinese and Alaskan princesses. (The Alaskan encounter
provides a laugh-out-loud visual gag.)</TE>
<TE>   And, among the show's magic and illusions--a company
specialty--are Cinderella's "levitation" scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rather spectacular illusion," Smith said, "but it doesn't
come off as a spectacular feat. The fairy godmother gets carried away
helping her with her chores, and when Cinderella comes back from the
ball, she's just floating on clouds. We choose stories that have
transformation and magic in them," he noted. "We try to have it all
come out of the story, not just add it on."</TE>
<TE>   There are "ooh and ahh" moments in the production design itself as
well. Some are earned by set designer and painter Jessie Walker, a
scenic artist for such films as "Illuminata." The romantic celestial
motif of the fold-out, stage-within-a-stage set, topped by a glowing
sun and moon, was inspired by artworks of the zodiac and
representations of the heavens that date from the time of French
author Charles Perrault's 17th century version of the Cinderella
story.</TE>
<TE>   Walker was influenced, too, by theaters of the Baroque era, "where
everything would be moving, everything was mechanical [and] cut out,
like a pop-up book come to life," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Scenes and action in the show were also created through a
sophisticated use of color, abstract patterns and the movement of
light, crafted by theater and opera lighting designer Thomas Hase,
(among his recent credits is Meredith Monk's science-fiction chamber
opera "Magic Frequencies").</TE>
<TE>   The company's next major touring show is Hans Christian Andersen's
"The Snow Queen."</TE>

<LD>* Executive director of the East L.A. gallery Self Help Graphics.</LD>
<LD>   Cafe y Mucho Mas: The best place in town is Espresso Mi Cultura in
Hollywood. They have a small but really good selection of books. It's
one of the really few repositories of Latino books, cards,
collectibles and CDs. They also have readings, performances, music, a
coffee bar that's extraordinary, and a place where you can just sit
and hang. There's a thing in Spanish called the pena, which is sort
of like a gathering place, and it's a focus of Latino intelligentsia
in terms of writers and the types that hang there.</LD>
<LD>   Old Glove: Whenever I can get the chance, I put my kid in the car
and we go up to Ventura. It's always cool and breezy downtown, and
they have great, little bookstores, a cool coffee shop or two and
some funky second-hand stores. And then you head over to the pier,
and they've got stuff for the kids and you can get fresh seafood. You
don't have to spend Santa Barbara money.</LD>
<TE>   No Sour Cream Please: If you really want to do an East L.A. date
night and impress your date with incredible cuisine, the best
restaurant in town is La Serenata de Garibaldi. They're known on the
Westside too, but the original one is on 1st Street. It's ethnic, but
it's not a cookie-cutter Mexican restaurant. On any given night,
you're going to see locals, politicians and people from all over town
there.</TE>
<TE>   Eastside Art Scene: Any time you go to Yolanda Gonzalez's studio,
MA Gallery, there's always some of the best work in the city. That's
just down the street from Self Help Graphics on Cesar E. Chavez
Avenue. Going up Figueroa Avenue in Highland Park, there's about
three or four places that just opened up. There's Rock Rose, the
Avenue 50 Studio, and there's another little funky community cultural
center, Flor y Canto, that some kids are trying to get together,
which is raw and beautiful. There's also a place by Margaret Garcia.
So that whole section is really starting to kick off.</TE>
<TE>   Vin Scully: My favorite thing to do on a Sunday is go to a Dodger
game. The Dodgers can be losing 25-0, but you know you're going to
have a good time because it's the Dodgers. It's the organ music. It's
the peanuts. It's the pageantry. It's turning around and talking to
complete strangers, but because you're talking about the second
baseman and the way he throws, you're like the best of friends. It's
that wonderful feeling you get on a late Sunday afternoon when the
shadow is starting to creep across the field.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Set in a South Bronx slum in the mid-1970s, Migdalia Cruz's "The
Have-Little," at the Strasberg Center's Marilyn Monroe Theatre, is an
unsettling reminder that, for many, poverty is destiny. Just hanging
onto the bottom rung of the socioeconomic ladder is an exhausting
endeavor. Any upward momentum requires determination, smarts and a
supportive family--or a combination of the three.</LD>
<LD>   Fifteen-year-old Lillian Rivera (America Ferrera), protagonist of
the play, just doesn't have the emotional muscularity to rise above
her circumstances. A so-so student, Lillian lives with her
argumentative mother, Carmen (Maricela Ochoa), in a shabby tenement
apartment. Lillian's alcoholic father, Jose (sympathetic Julian Scott
Urena), is a sad case, and her best friend, Michi (refreshingly
offbeat Elisa Bocanegra), is a short-timer itching to escape to a
better life.</LD>
<LD>   Desperate for human connection, Lillian takes up with a
neighborhood junkie who gets her pregnant and dies of an overdose in
short order.</LD>
<TE>   Reverses continue apace, as Lillian becomes more and more firmly
stuck in her fast-congealing life.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz's unvarnished drama commences with raw power but eventually
sags into excess. Having Lillian "talk" to her diary is a tired
device, especially when Jose discovers the book--an occasion for
tear-jerking of the most manipulative order. And the scenes following
Carmen's death seem protracted and anticlimactic--a full symphony
when all that is really needed is a summary coda.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran director Diane Rodriguez occasionally errs on the side of
sentiment, overplaying scenes that could have used more emotional
restraint.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ferrera, who won a special acting prize at the 2002
Sundance Film Festival, is touching and genuine, and the raspy-voiced
Ochoa shines as a mother whose hurtful outbursts eclipse the
tenderness she cannot express.</TE>
<TE>   Superb design elements--Akeime Mitterlehner's low-rent set, Steven
N. Lee's scruffy costumes, Drew Dalzell's echoing sound and Rand
Ryan's neon-tinged lighting--illustrate the marginal condition of
these flawed but valiant have-littles.</TE>
<TE>   "The Have-Little," Marilyn Monroe Theater at the Lee Strasberg

Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends April 14. $17-$19.

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanley Jordan is making one of his occasional solo appearances in
the Southland this week, displaying what is surely one of the most
unusual instrumental techniques in any genre of music. His
opening-night set at the Jazz Bakery offered a characteristic display
of his "tapping" method of guitar playing, in which he moves both
hands freely across the strings, producing notes by tapping the
strings onto the frets.</LD>
<LD>   The results were startling, even to one who has frequently seen
Jordan in action. His method literally transforms the instrument,
opening possibilities for dense chordal sounds and multiple moving
lines, supplemented by all the more familiar guitar techniques--from
strumming and picking to bent notes and sliding tones.</LD>
<LD>   All this wouldn't matter much, of course, if it was nothing more
than a display of exotic mechanical artistry. But Jordan, whose jazz
roots are firm, brought an improvisatory perception to everything he
played, transforming tunes via rhapsodic variations, fragmenting,
reconstructing, playing melodic variations--the entire panoply of
jazz soloing enhanced by the broad sweep of his instrumental style.</LD>
<TE>   Typically, he roved through a range of material. He has always
been fond of Lennon &amp; McCartney tunes, this time offering a medley
that began with "Because" and ended with "Eleanor Rigby." Another
Jordan favorite, Paul Simon's "El Condor Pasa," surfaced in a fashion
far removed from its Andean roots, while his rendering of "When You
Wish Upon a Star" recalled its sweetly lyrical presence in the film
"Pinocchio."</TE>
<TE>   The more straight-ahead jazz elements in the program surfaced with
Benny Golson's "Along Came Betty" and the classic standard "Willow
Weep for Me." Jordan's blues qualities pushed through the shimmering
string sounds to energize his one-man-band qualities with a forceful
rhythmic swing.</TE>
<TE>   If there was a problem with his otherwise compelling program, it
was Jordan's tendency to repeat material he has often examined in the
past. Given the remarkable potential of his "tapping" style, one
wonders why he hasn't encouraged composers to provide some original
works aimed at employing his enormously diverse technical
possibilities. As one of the jazz world's true originals, Jordan
would do well to more thoroughly explore the full extent of that
singularity.</TE>

<LD>   "Into the Woods"--"I wish." These restless words are at the
beginning and the end of "Into the Woods," the wise and witty musical
by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine. Even after "Into the Woods"
opened on Broadway in 1987, wishes kept cropping up in Lapine's mind,
as the librettist and director thought about the show. His wishing
led to an altered version of "Into the Woods," now at the Ahmanson
Theatre, with changes in the staging and design and a few slightly
modified lines. It would be a cruel irony if Lapine's efforts got him
into trouble. If the characters in this musical learn anything, it's
that desires can backfire when they come true. "Careful the wish you
make," wrote composer-lyricist Sondheim. Fortunately, Lapine and
Sondheim avoided that trap. Most of their changes make minor
improvements in what was already a masterpiece. Blessed with an
impressive cast, this new "Into the Woods" emerges from the thickets
in triumph. Besides an impressive cast and a lustrous set, it
includes a dynamic new blocking for "The Last Midnight," a second
wolf, more action for the cow and the narrator, and other interesting
changes in design and staging.</LD>

<HD>A 'Hatful' of American Social Realism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Life can seem so full of promise when, all of a sudden, troubles
begin to sprout up like weeds, choking out hope and happiness.</LD>
<LD>   The protagonist of "A Hatful of Rain" has overcome a difficult
childhood to emerge as a Korean War hero in prosperous mid-'50s
America. But he also has a morphine addiction that he's trying to
hide, and it's about to cost him everything he holds dear.</LD>
<LD>   Michael V. Gazzo's play is a grim little slice of social realism
from 1955, when America and the family were being closely scrutinized
by Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller and William Inge. Gazzo's script
doesn't match theirs, but it still speaks powerfully when performed
with conviction, as it is at Actors Forum Theatre in North Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   Events play out in a cramped yet meticulously cared-for apartment
on New York's Lower East Side, designed by Juan Rojas Aguilar.</TE>
<TE>   As embodied by Dominic Comperatore, the central character, Johnny,
is strong yet fragile, with haunted eyes that are the window to his
soul.</TE>
<TE>   As Celia, his wife, Laura Lamson is a lovely, willowy young woman
who is quickly turning hard and brittle. Stuck in a secure if
unrewarding job and married to a man who refuses to tell her
anything--least of all, why he disappears at night--she is frustrated
and lonely.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Saldone--playing Johnny's brother, Polo--is torn between his
love for his troubled sibling and his growing attraction toward
Celia. He tries to do the right things for both yet always manages to
come out in the wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The pacing is taut, the performances lived-in, in a staging
overseen by Actors Forum producing director Audrey M. Singer.</TE>
<TE>   Well-observed if at times melodramatic, "A Hatful of Rain" is an
American tragedy about lives chewed up and spit out by the machines
of war and commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "A Hatful of Rain," Actors Forum Theatre, 10655 Magnolia Blvd.,
North Hollywood. Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends
March 31. $15. (818) 506-0600. Running time: 2 hours, 20 minutes.</TE>

<LD>All the many versions of this classic "comfort" dessert begin with
bread and milk.</LD>
<LD>   Traxx: Chef Tara Thomas uses a buttery rosemary brioche bread,
which gives her pudding richness and a lingering bouquet. It's held
together by a light custard and topped with a dark red berry coulis
and cream. (Rosemary bread pudding with berry coulis, $5.) Traxx,
Union Station, 800 N. Alameda St., L.A. (213) 625-1999.</LD>
<LD>   vermont: First you taste vanilla custard, then toasted brioche,
finally the dime-sized chips of bittersweet French chocolate, just
beginning to melt. It's garnished with a mint leaf and a few fresh
berries. (Chocolate chip bread pudding, $7.) vermont, 1714 N. Vermont
Ave., Los Feliz, (323) 661-6163.</LD>
<TE>   5 Dudley: Here you might find homemade honey wheat toast or
sourdough filone layered with a dried apricot and toasted coconut
custard, served warm in a pool of strawberry mousse, topped with
blueberry coulis and garnished with berries. There's also a
bittersweet chocolate and caramelized banana version with
butterscotch sauce and creme anglais. (Bread pudding, $7.) 5 Dudley,
5 Dudley Ave., Venice, (310) 399-6678.</TE>
<TE>   The Cat &amp; the Custard Cup: This bread pudding is layers of French
bread, caramel and vanilla custard, filled with dried apricots and
fresh apple. Served warm with raspberry and orange sauce and whipped
cream, you might take some home for breakfast. (Apricot bread
pudding, $6.75) The Cat &amp; the Custard Cup, 8000 E. Whittier Blvd., La
Habra, (562) 694-3812.</TE>
<TE>   Axe: Chef-owner Joanna Moore's individual bread puddings, each
made to order, are based on French bread, plenty of raisins and a bit
of cinnamon. Dusted with sugar and broiled to get a nice sugary crust
on top, they come hot and running with thick cream. (Bread pudding,
$5.) Axe, 1009 Abby Kinney Blvd., Venice, (310) 664-9787.</TE>
<TE>   Joan's on Third: Here's a place to get old-fashioned bread pudding
to go. It's made with raisins, French bread and evaporated and whole
milk, stirred as it cooks to make sure every piece of bread browns.
(Bread pudding, $4.50.) Joan's on Third, 8350 W. 3rd St., Los
Angeles, (323) 655-2285.</TE>

<LD>   'Late Night' Reruns to Air on Comedy Central</LD>
<LD>   Comedy Central will begin showing next-day reruns of NBC's "Late
Night With Conan O'Brien" in September, the cable network announced
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Episodes of "Late Night," which airs Mondays through Fridays on
NBC at 12:35 a.m., will be seen the following evening on Comedy
Central, at a time to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, which is for one year plus an option on a second,
continues a spate of moves in which broadcast networks look to defray
costs by repeating shows on basic cable channels.</TE>
<TE>   NBC is aligned with several cable networks but lacks corporate
ties to a general entertainment outlet on cable like Fox, which has
the FX network, and CBS, whose corporate parent Viacom also owns MTV
and VH1.</TE>
<TE>   Already, however, NBC has made arrangements with cable's E!
Entertainment Television to air repeats of two other late-night
series, "Last Call With Carson Daly" and "Saturday Night Live."</TE>
<TE>   Academy Planning Events About Sept. 11</TE>
<TE>   Television is already planning for the anniversary of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, and recognizing itself in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Among the projects in the works: The New York-based National
Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences is putting together a three-day
event, "9/11 to 9/11: A Television Reflection."</TE>
<TE>   The academy's project will include televised tributes by
broadcasters around the world, recognition of journalists killed
covering the war on terrorism and the launch of a fund to help their
families, and a symposium in New York to study the role of television
in covering the year's events.</TE>
<TE>   POP MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Keyboard Player Sues Backstreet Boys</TE>
<TE>   A former keyboard player for the Backstreet Boys is suing the
group for his cut from two of their songs on the "Black and Blue"
album.</TE>
<TE>   Billboard reports that Tommy Smith filed the action, claiming he
co-wrote "The Answer to Our Life" with Nick Carter and "Time" with
Brian Littrell and Guy Walker. Smith says they had an oral agreement.
His lawyer says damages should be more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for the Backstreet Boys says he's investigating the claim
and "will be responding fairly."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Michael Keaton and Helena Bonham Carter will star in HBO Films'
"Live From Baghdad," a behind-the-scenes story of CNN reporters
during the Gulf War. It is based on the memoir of the same name by
CNN senior executive producer Robert Wiener and will begin filming
this May in Los Angeles and Morocco.... Former Beatle Paul McCartney
will make his Oscar debut Sunday at the 74th Academy Awards. He'll
sing "Vanilla Sky," from the film of the same name, which is
nominated in the original song category .... Artisan Entertainment
announced Wednesday that it will produce the first feature-length
film based on the popular VeggieTales videos, titled "Jonah--A
VeggieTales Movie," set for a fall release.... Actress Michelle
Rodriguez, who played a boxer in the film "Girlfight", has been
accused of simple assault and harassment in New Jersey. The complaint
was brought by a 22-year-old woman who told police that Rodriguez
attacked her without provocation Saturday. Rodriguez pleaded not
guilty and was released on $2,500 bail.... Aerosmith will be the
honoree at MTV's second annual mtvICON, airing April 17.</TE>

<LD>* New This Week: "Riding in Cars With Boys," which stars Drew
Barrymore as a teen mother who goes on to become a writer, is a
failed film that gives glimpses of the success that might have been.
Buried under the miscalculations, the shamelessness, the off-putting
and inappropriate broadness are sporadically visible souvenirs of a
good project gone bad, hints of the unusual, bittersweet story that
got away. Barrymore plays a good girl surviving bad situations in
screenwriter Morgan Upton Ward's adaptation of a widely appreciated
memoir by Beverly Donofrio. Only two actors climb out of the
wreckage: Steve Zahn, who beautifully arouses our sympathy with his
fine work as the overmatched husband, and Brittany Murphy, invariably
funny as Barrymore's best friend.</LD>

<HD>They Lived 'Slap Shot'</HD>
<DH>The Hanson brothers, plucked from hockey obscurity for the
1977 film, return for a sequel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK OLSEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"You guys the Hansons?"</LD>
<LD>   Spoken by Paul Newman, who portrayed the washed-up player-coach of
a dilapidated minor-league hockey team in the 1977 film "Slap Shot,"
these words introduced the world to what has become a phenomenon.</LD>
<LD>   The three gangly, long-haired farm boys with thick glasses, first
seen assaulting a soda machine and hurling profanity as easily as a
high-flying elbow, have in the ensuing 25 years become folk heroes.</LD>
<TE>   Besides the 30 to 40 personal appearances they've made each year
since 1994, the Hanson brothers have inspired action figures, a
tribute band and a legion of fans. Mention the name to some fans and
expect to hear "puttin' on the foil," "none of that stinkin' root
beer" and other lines from the film.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I asked was, 'Are the Hansons back?'" said Steve
Boyum, director of the new straight-to-video sequel, which hits
stores Tuesday. "I don't think you could make a 'Slap Shot' film
without the Hansons." During shooting and post-production for "Slap
Shot 2: Breaking the Ice," he said, "they were what people asked
about. They're the thing people remember most."</TE>
<TE>   The Hanson brothers are actually the Carlson brothers--more
accurately, brothers Steve and Jeff Carlson, plus friend and former
teammate Dave Hanson. All three played for the Johnstown (Pa.) Jets
during the 1974-'75 season, along with the Carlsons' brother, Jack.
Teammate Ned Dowd's sister Nancy, who was a fledgling screenwriter,
followed the team briefly and had her brother make audiotapes of idle
hours in locker rooms and bus rides and bars. She met the Carlsons,
Hanson and many of the other players who would eventually fill out
the fictional Charlestown Chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by George Roy Hill, "Slap Shot" was a moderate box-office
success, buoyed largely by the star presence of Newman. The film was
dismissed by many critics as cheap exploitation, and a general sense
of indignant outrage seemed to trail its coarse language and on-ice
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Although they were aware of the research by Nancy Dowd (who would
later win an Oscar for her work on "Coming Home" and write scripts
for "Swing Shift" and "Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains"),
the team members never expected to be in the film. As Dave Hanson
explains in a Great Lakes drawl, "One day I'm having a pregame nap
and there's a knock at my door. I'm in my underwear and a little
groggy, and there's someone who looks like Paul Newman with a bunch
of other guys. He says, 'I'm Paul Newman and these guys want to get a
look at what a hockey player's apartment looks like.' I said to come
in, and he asked for a beer and said he'd like to sit down and watch
the race while they looked around. So it sort of kicked in maybe this
was for real."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the wilder incidents in the film--fighting during warmups
for a game, attacking fans who threw objects on the ice and landing
in jail for it--stem from real events that occurred during what
Hanson and Carlson describe as a fairly average season.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Studios offered the guys a movie contract, but they
turned it down when they discovered they'd have to act during hockey
season. In the ensuing years, they would all move separately from
team to team, playing among them a total of 85 games in the National
Hockey League. Thanks to "Slap Shot's" renewed life on home video and
frequent showings on cable, the Hanson brothers' legacy lived on.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, when Steve was a player-coach with the minor-league
Memphis River Kings, he asked Jeff and Dave to come down one weekend
for a ceremonial dropping of the puck in hopes of boosting
attendance. With short hair, dressed in coats and ties, the reunited
Hansons helped fill a 9,000-seat stadium and signed autographs for
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Trying it again at the home arena of the upstate New York team
Dave managed, and skating with trademark glasses, they attracted
another sellout crowd. Ever since, they've been appearing mostly at
fantasy camps and charity games.</TE>
<TE>   Steve and his wife run the Hanson business from their Kenosha,
Wis., home, Jeff is an electrician in Muskegon, Mich., and Dave
manages a sports center in Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson and the two Carlson brothers have also been featured in a
display on "Slap Shot" in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. "That's
really for the greats," Steve Carlson says. "We were just average
players, so to be recognized like that, as ambassadors of the game,
is a tremendous thrill."</TE>
<TE>   Although they've lived with the characters for years, the three
were a little nervous about the sequel, their first time acting since
the original. "We were rehearsing our first scene and I felt
uncomfortable," Carlson says. "Things just weren't clicking, it
didn't feel right. And then I put on my glasses, and it was like
Superman putting on his cape. After that, everything went smooth. But
I still don't know how actors can stand all the waiting around."</TE>
<TE>   According to Broderick Miller, screenwriter of the new film, the
Hansons had no trouble slipping into character, ad-libbing many of
their lines. "They're such natural comedians," he says. "If you just
let them riff, they'll come up with great stuff." Director Boyum
seconds this opinion. "My only mandate to them was to make me laugh."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to define the Hansons' appeal, Miller says, "It's not that
the Hansons are simple-minded, but that they're single-minded. They
have such a reckless ferocity and enthusiasm for everything they do.
Who wouldn't want them on their side?"</TE>
<TE>   As an example of that enthusiasm, Miller adds, "I was having a
conflict on set with someone who was also playing a member of the
opposing team. The Hansons knew about it, and before a scene they
said, 'Broderick, this one's for you.' And they proceeded to
literally slam the guy into the wall like six times."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Hanson thinks it isn't hard to understand what makes the
Hansons such an enduring presence.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hockey players. We were able to come across as so natural
because we were in our environment. Jeff, Steve and myself are real
live people. There's no acting involved. That's us."</TE>

<DH>Images in beautiful 'Baraka' warn about society's
detachment from mother nature.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To a considerable extent, the effect of Ron Fricke's visionary,
shimmeringly beautiful 1993 "Baraka," which the American Cinematheque
screens tonight through Saturday at the Egyptian, will depend on
whether the viewer has seen Godfrey Reggio's "Koyaanisqatsi" or its
sequel, "Powaqqatsi."</LD>
<LD>   Like those two films, "Baraka" is a dazzling, disturbing collage
of images of life on this planet warning of the dangers of our
increasing detachment from nature and our pillaging of the Earth's
resources. It is far too similar to those earlier films for its own
good, yet such is its sheer gorgeousness in its Todd-AO 70-millimeter
grandeur and its superb sense of structure and movement that it is
nevertheless affecting.</LD>
<LD>   "Baraka" takes its title from an ancient Sufi word suggesting the
essence of life from which the evolutionary process unfolds. Fricke,
who was "Koyaanisqatsi's" cinematographer, co-writer and co-editor,
has said his favorite theme is "humanity's relationship to the
eternal," which is precisely what he and his colleagues explore in
"Baraka."</LD>
<TE>   It begins with a majestic half-hour survey of individuals in the
timeless act of religious worship in ancient, glorious settings the
world over. This sequence gives way to scenes of tribal peoples
participating in traditional dances, but as the film moves toward its
middle, the images grow increasingly ominous, with depictions of the
Earth's desecration and the frenetic, congested quality of modern
urban existence. In this segment, Fricke uses the speeded-up
cinematography techniques he first employed in "Koyaanisqatsi" to
suggest humans becoming like ants and robots: He has a passion for
shots of dehumanizing assembly lines.</TE>
<TE>   This portion of "Baraka," the most derivative of his earlier
efforts, is its least-satisfying part, but gradually the film regains
momentum as it completes its circle, returning to concerns of
worship. Without a word, Fricke makes it perfectly clear that
humanity has a choice and that survival depends on choosing the
spiritual over the material and caring for others and for our planet
as much as we care for ourselves. His key colleagues are producer and
co-writer-editor Mark Magidson and inspired composer Michael Stearns,
whose score at all times reinforces the film's images.</TE>
<TE>   "Baraka" was shot in 24 countries over 14 months, but none of its
locations, many of which are unfamiliar, is identified. Technically,
the film is awesome. Like the Reggio films, it does not hesitate to
use the most advanced technology to deplore the effect of technology
on our lives.</TE>
<TE>   Fricke's cinematography is so consistently magnificent in the
compositions of its images and in their clarity, in its use of
natural light and delicacy of hue, that Fricke creates a further
paradox: His film is consistently beautiful even in its most ominous
moments. At 7:30 p.m. Cinematheque information: (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Laemmle Theaters' latest "Documentary Days" weekend matinee
series commences Saturday and Sunday at 10 a.m. at the Sunset 5 with
Sharon Greytak's engrossing and provocative "Losing It," in which she
interviews seven individuals in five countries to discover how
they're coping with physical handicaps.</TE>
<TE>   Greytak, who uses a wheelchair as a result of severe rheumatoid
arthritis that struck in childhood, has done a number of acclaimed
films. In this project, she wanted to find out if others have
succeeded in becoming as independent as she has. She discovers that
few of the disabled people she interviews live in societies that are
as sensitive to the disabled as the United States; she finds that
Brazil, mired in poverty, seems more accepting of physical handicaps
than the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In Siberia, she meets a woman whose polio has restricted her to a
wheelchair and a young man with cerebral palsy who can walk with
difficulty but uses a wheelchair away from home. In the post-Soviet
era, the rights of the disabled have expanded while financial aid has
dwindled. The woman is a resourceful activist, but the young man,
despite his mastery of four languages, faces a bleak future.</TE>
<TE>   In Hong Kong, Greytak meets Edith Mok, a successful corporate
workaholic who suffered a stroke in her late 40s and now, several
years later, continues her rehabilitation zealously. Mok, who walks
with a limp, believes it will be impossible for her to find a job and
has confronted widespread hostility. At the same time she has drawn
closer to her husband.</TE>
<TE>   In the lovely old city of Vicenza, Italy, Greytak visits an artist
she had known as a student. A decade earlier, Marino Crivellari
developed a rare, crippling blood disorder. Since then, he has become
rehabilitated except for his speech, which is so slow and drawn out
that he remains isolated.</TE>
<TE>   In Sao Paulo, she meets polio-afflicted Edna Maria Pacheco, who
supports herself and her son by selling candy at traffic lights but
cannot count on aid when she can no longer work.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian writer Marcelo Paiva became a quadriplegic after an
accident. Admitting that his renown and financial resources have been
a plus, Paiva became determined not to be robbed of the love of life
he enjoyed before the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Greytak winds up her survey in New York, where she talks to Carol
Robertson, who has used a wheelchair since suffering polio as a child
and who is both police commissioner and the mother of two.</TE>
<TE>   As Greytak considers these people, she expresses an appreciation
for the perspective she's received from her determination not to
allow her disability to become a limitation. As a personal memoir,
"Losing It," a beautifully shot and composed film, might be
appropriately called "Gaining It." Laemmle information: (323)
848-3500. "Losing It" also screens March 30 and 31 at 11 a.m. at the
Monica 4-Plex, 1332 2nd St., Santa Monica, (310) 394-9741; April 6
and 7 at the Playhouse 7, 673 E. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena, (626)
844-6500; and April 20 and 21 at the Lido Cinema, Via Lido at
Newport, Newport Beach, (949) 673-8350.</TE>

<TE>   Having received a new heating and air conditioning system, San
Pedro's 1931 Art Deco movie palace, the Warner Grand, 478 West 6th
St., is ready to reopen Saturday with a 7:30 p.m. screening, preceded
by a 6:45 p.m. reception, of the evergreen "Grand Hotel" (1932), the
first all-star talkie.</TE>
<TE>   With one of the most exciting casts ever assembled on the screen
in a story rich in romance and drama, it represents Hollywood at its
best, a rare instance when art and entertainment are one.</TE>
<TE>   What is remarkable about this MGM best picture Oscar winner is its
timelessness. There is nothing dated about its plot or performances.
And the sets, costumes and women's coiffeurs have been designed with
such restraint that they transcend their Art Deco period.</TE>
<TE>   Adapted from William A. Drake's stage version of Vicki Baum's
best-selling novel, "Grand Hotel" is perhaps the first of many films
to use a single device or situation to link several unrelated but
contemporaneous stories. In the setting of a first-class Berlin
hotel, Baum found the ideal situation in which to present a
cross-section of humanity. In the course of 24 hours, she shows a
group of individuals at moments of crisis in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   There is Great Garbo, a weary and fading Russian ballerina who is
revitalized--at least for the moment--by the love of John Barrymore,
a penniless, polished baron who has come to steal her jewels but
stays to lose his heart. There is Wallace Beery, a German
industrialist facing imminent ruin, who hires Joan Crawford as a
stenographer and then some. Finally, there is Lionel Barrymore, a
minor bookkeeper in Beery's firm, who is taking a first and final
fling before being overtaken by a fatal disease. Directed sensitively
by Edmund Goulding, "Grand Hotel" will always be grand. (310)
548-7672.</TE>

<TE>   To coincide with Sunday's Academy Awards presentations, the Silent
Movie is presenting William Wellman's World War I epic "Wings"
(1927), the first winner of the best picture Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   A $1.7-million blockbuster for its day, it will be shown with an
intermission, tinted coloring and a process called Magnascope that
widened the projected image for the aerial sequences. The silent
classic may seem a trifle corny, but it retains tremendous verve,
thanks to the lusty direction of William Wellman.</TE>
<TE>   One sure-fire sequence goes this way: An All-American flying ace,
played by Charles (Buddy) Rogers, is heading back to his base in his
Sopwith Camel when out of the clouds comes a red Fokker D-VIII.
Executing an Immelmann--a half loop, a half roll and a turn--Rogers
quickly catches up with the German aircraft and fires away, not
hearing the frantic cry, "Don't shoot, Buddy! It's me, Dave!" What he
couldn't know is the Fokker's pilot is none other than his pal
(Richard Arlen), who had been shot down by the Huns and is trying to
get back across Allied lines in a stolen plane.</TE>
<TE>   There's also plenty going on down on the ground. Rogers and Arlen,
small-town best friends from boyhood, are in love with the same girl,
played by Clara Bow, who turns up on the battlefront, having signed
up with the Red Cross. John Monk Saunders wrote the story.</TE>
<TE>   Be on the lookout for Gary Cooper in a bit part that helped launch
both his career and a torrid off-screen romance with Bow.</TE>
<TE>   "Wings," which will be presented with live musical accompaniment,
screens Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 1 p.m. 611 N.
Fairfax Ave. (323) 655-2520.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Nuart will open Friday a one-week run of a new 35-millimeter
wide-screen print of Jacques Demy's first film, the romantic and
lyrical "Lola" from 1961, starring Anouk Aimee (star of the current
"Festival in Cannes"). Aimee plays a Nantes cabaret dancer whose
heart still belongs to the sailor who deserted her seven years
earlier, leaving her to raise their son alone. With music by Michel
Legrand. (310) 478-6379.</TE>

<DH>The Moiseyev Dance Company's global program mixes
brilliance with kitsch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Igor Moiseyev is internationally celebrated as a pioneer of
theatricalized folklore, he started his dance career in ballet--at
the Bolshoi in Moscow. That classical heritage looms especially large
in the current tour repertory of his youthful, 65-year-old Moiseyev
Dance Company.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the program at the Wilshire Theatre on Tuesday (opening
night of a seven-performance engagement) suggested a suite of
national dances from some full-evening 19th century story ballet.</LD>
<LD>   Besides a generous selection of Russian specialties, Moiseyev
provided Spanish, Polish, Argentine and Venezuelan
divertissements--choreographed with a blend of brilliant corps
geometry and virtuoso feats that remained consistently spectacular.</LD>
<TE>   In the familiar Ukrainian "Hopak" that ended the evening, for
instance, the way the group choreography accumulated speed and force
provided an object lesson in compositional sophistication rather than
homespun folk values. And when Oleg Chernasov flew over the line of
women in a classic Moiseyev image, Chernasov added a new dimension to
an old trick by hovering in the air for a long moment as if deciding
whether or not to come down.</TE>
<TE>   Other selections in the 14-part performance (not counting the
usual Americana encore) reflected the experiments in classicism that
invigorated Russian ballet early in the 20th century. After its
kitsch opening, for example, "Day on Board a Ship" developed into a
nautical ballet mecanique: a dozen men lined up in formations that
made their unison movements suggest a powerful engine.</TE>
<TE>   Bodies as pistons generating a steady, inhuman energy--such a
Machine Age fantasy belongs alongside other examples of Russian
Futurism and has no real relevance to folklore. Like "Partisans,"
Moiseyev's enduring depiction of World War II freedom fighters, it
adapts folk material but it is theater dance, no more folkloric than
the dancing peasants in "Giselle."</TE>
<TE>   Most of Moiseyev's choreography on this and previous tours can be
called character ballets, for they use pantomime techniques to sketch
the people whose interactions drive or unify a particular work.</TE>
<TE>   In "Cunning Makanu," the devious but good-hearted Rudi Khodzhoyan
not only unites two young lovers but also inspires the men's corps to
acts of comic revenge before the piece settles into expansive formal
dances. The narrative itself may be trivial, but without it the solo
opportunities and the various group dances would seem thrown
together.</TE>
<TE>   Even a brief, small-scale work such as "Dance of Kazan Tatars"
(like "Day on Board a Ship," new to American audiences) sets up its
display of steps in the context of a quasi-narrative, humanizing the
dance content but also arguably making its characters far too cute.</TE>
<TE>   Over 2 1/2 hours, Moiseyev's cuteness can become cloying--it even
infects "Partisans"--so it's a relief when the company stops trying
to charm us and simply dances with elegance and reserve, as in
"Oberek," another novelty on the current tour.</TE>
<TE>   Here seven couples begin in stately ballroom deployments, with arm
flourishes and swirls of the men's cape-like coats leading to a fast
section featuring a typical Moiseyev array of stunts: air turns,
vaulting maneuvers, knee-walking and the like.</TE>
<TE>   The young dancers who now embody Moiseyev's vision are always
exciting, but only "Oberek" and a few other interludes free them from
the chore of relentlessly working the room. After 10 triumphant
American tours, a little more trust in innate Moiseyev showmanship
would be reasonable, and welcome.</TE>
<TE>   Moiseyev Dance Company, Wilshire Theatre, 8440 Wilshire Blvd.,
Beverly Hills. Today and Friday, 8 p.m. Saturday, 2 and 8 p.m.
Sunday, 2 p.m. $37 to $69.50. (213) 365-3500.</TE>

<DL>SYDNEY, Australia</DL>
<LD>Ali Ammouchi lies on the floor performing for fellow students, one
arm pointing toward a sign saying "Dreams," his face gazing up to
another labeled "Reality."</LD>
<LD>   Ammouchi's dream is Hollywood. His reality starts here, on the
floor of Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art, known simply
as NIDA.</LD>
<LD>   A former drama teacher, the 27-year-old is following in
illustrious footsteps.</LD>
<TE>   "I told my students I was going to Mel Gibson's old acting school
to be a movie star--they laughed and said, 'Yeah, sure, sir.'"</TE>
<TE>   Ammouchi is one of 180 students at NIDA, established in Sydney in
1958 as a hothouse for young Australian talent hoping to burst onto
the world scene as actors, directors, designers, playwrights and
technicians.</TE>
<TE>   NIDA graduates have won Emmys, Golden Globes and Oscars. And three
alumni--"Moulin Rouge" director-producer Baz Luhrmann and the movie's
costume designers, Catherine Martin and Angus Strathie--are nominated
for this year's Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   Several Australians who did not study at the school are also up
for Oscars, including Nicole Kidman for best actress in "Moulin
Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   Success in Hollywood has come to many other graduates, including
Mel Gibson and Judy Davis (from NIDA's class of 1977) and Cate
Blanchett (1992). Geoffrey Rush, who won a best actor Oscar for
1996's "Shine," once taught there.</TE>
<TE>   It would be difficult to find a production made in Australia today
that doesn't have a former NIDA student in its cast or crew. A survey
conducted by the institute in 2000 found that 84% of its alumni still
worked in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   NIDA Director John Clark said the school's "approach to acting is
not dogmatic, it's very open and it provides young people the whole
range of ideas from which they can then choose and develop their own
approach to the business."</TE>
<TE>   Just 25 students a year from across the nation are chosen from
about 2,500 hopefuls.</TE>
<TE>   In three years of study, they attend movement classes, voice
coaching, singing lessons and rehearse and perform about 12 major
productions that are open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   The school recently spent $17 million on a new wing that includes
a 700-seat theater, a sound stage for film and television training, a
multimedia studio, a smaller theater and new rehearsal rooms. Gibson,
who provides an annual scholarship for NIDA students, donated $1
million toward it.</TE>
<TE>   It's anticipated that the investment will pay off with continued
waves of Australian talent exported to Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Ammouchi wants to ride those waves, and his plan sounds
disarmingly simple.</TE>
<TE>   "Do a film in Australia, get respected, get recognized and maybe
do a couple of Hollywood blockbusters," Ammouchi said. "It's been a
childhood dream of mine."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>In an era in which the most mundane creative efforts routinely
receive breathless behind-the-scenes analysis, it's a fresh jolt
indeed when the format and material actually deserve each other.
Tonight at 8:30 on the Sundance Channel, such a happy convergence
unfolds in the engrossing "Anatomy of a Scene" series, dealing with
"Memento."</LD>
<LD>   The tenaciously ambitious film starring Guy Pearce ("L.A.
Confidential") as a memory-impaired man searching for the truth
behind his wife's rape and murder is a kaleidoscopic nightmare of a
work that begs for further examination.</LD>
<LD>   The end-to-beginning structure of writer-director Christopher
Nolan's movie challenged audiences as well as Oscar-nominated editor
Dody Dorn. What makes tonight's episode work so well is the breezy
eloquence with which Nolan, Dorn and other key players take us inside
the production.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a tricky balance in the beginning of intriguing the audience
and confusing the audience, and at the same time just giving them
enough time to connect with the material," says Nolan.</TE>
<TE>   The program may be best for those who've already seen the film,
but one hopes it will send the uninitiated scrambling to the video
store.</TE>

<LD>You know it's spring in Southern California this year because the
theme parks are warming up to the locals.</LD>
<LD>   While attendance at most theme parks has inched back up to normal,
a year of economic sluggishness and diminished travel after Sept. 11
have made for a hard few months. Now, at the start of
spring--typically the "slowest season of the year for everyone in our
business," according to Disneyland Resorts spokesman John
McClintock--some Southern California tourist magnets are scrambling
to pack the parks with local residents.</LD>
<LD>   Disneyland Resorts, the Queen Mary and Universal Studios
Hollywood, which rely most heavily on vacation travelers, have taken
the most dramatic steps. Special deals, combined with shorter lines
and mild weather, add up to the best season in recent memory for
locals to venture into Jurassic Park or size up Shamu.</LD>
<TE>   "We took a pretty big hit, particularly with international
tourism," says Brian Pope, vice president of Marketing Services at
Universal Studios Hollywood. Universal had new attractions in the
works--the Special Effects Stages, a hands-on crash course in effects
technology, opened earlier this month--but not enough visitors coming
through the turnstiles. So his company, like other theme parks, has
started luring locals, who may become repeat visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Universal is offering a $45 single-day ticket that is also a
yearlong pass. The theory is that repeat visitors who aren't paying
for admission are still spending money in the park, buying food,
T-shirts and trinkets. And they tend to bring friends with them. The
tickets are available only to Southern Californians through April 30.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the incentives, Pope said, visitors probably won't stand
in lines longer than 15 minutes during a midweek visit, even for the
popular Jurassic Park: The Ride and Terminator 2: 3D.</TE>
<TE>   Even SeaWorld, which typically draws a higher percentage of its
visitors from Southern California, is trying to keep those visitors
coming. In addition to reprising the hit land, sea and aerial show
Cirque de la Mer starting in May, the park is staying open late,
adding live music and other attractions that might appeal to those
who've already seen the seal tricks and Shamu's stunts. The park is
also selling a Fun Pass this year, an offer similar to Universal
Studios': any single-day ticket purchased by April 15 is good for the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Disneyland Resorts, which includes Disneyland and California
Adventure, calls its sale on tickets--$10 off the regular $43 adult
admission--the "Resident Salute." Any resident can buy up to five
discounted admissions. Coupled with a promotion through Albertson's
supermarkets, however, the park is clearly reaching out to area
families who might be thinking twice about flying anywhere for spring
break. Albertson's shoppers who buy a 12-pack of Coke or some other
specific items will receive a coupon for a free child's ticket to
California Adventure, normally $33, with the purchase of an adult
ticket.</TE>
<TE>   At the Queen Mary in Long Beach Harbor, a $10 ticket--$9 less than
it cost just last month--will get Southern California residents
aboard, and a child younger than 12 will get in free with each paying
adult. The docked luxury liner-turned-hotel is also capitalizing on
having the circus in town. Cirque du Soleil, the fanciful French
Canadian circus, is presenting "Dralion" under the big top in the
Queen Mary parking lot through April 7, and anyone with a Cirque
ticket can board the ship at no charge to have dinner or a cocktail
before or after the performance.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the parks have slashed prices. Magic Mountain reports that
its attendance has not been affected much since Sept. 11, because of
the new X roller coaster that debuted in January and a loyal
following among L.A.-area teenagers. Knott's Berry Farm, which
pioneered the idea of turning a seasonal event into a local tradition
with its Halloween Scary Farm, is rolling out Easter EggMazeMent this
weekend and launching a '50s-themed roller coaster called Xcelerator
in May.</TE>
<TE>   Spring break, which started for some last weekend and lasts until
after Easter, always leads to bigger crowds at parks. Afternoons and
weekends are more crowded than mornings or midweek days, say park
administrators. But even with the spike in attendance, all the deals
for Southern California residents will remain in place.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still trying to recover from that period" after the
September attacks, says Michael Eggert, director of Queen Mary
attraction operations. "Actually, our attendance has been quite good,
and we're hoping with this special price it will convince people in
the local communities to come for a visit."</TE>

<HD>New Endings, If Not All of the Answers</HD>
<DH>'Zoolander's' Ben Stiller explains it all, but the director
of 'Training Day' doesn't.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever leave a movie wishing for a different ending? Many DVDs these
days provide them--if they were shot, that is. They are among extra
features that are included on the discs, along with other deleted or
extended scenes, often with commentary from the director about why
those segments didn't make the final cut.</LD>
<LD>   Two DVDs out this week--"Training Day" (Warner, $27) and
"Zoolander" (Paramount, $30)--offer a chance to see epilogues that
might have been.</LD>
<LD>   In the action-thriller "Training Day," which stars Oscar nominees
Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, the unused ending is a scene that
comes after the one moviegoers saw detailing the fate of Washington's
crooked, brutal L.A. narcotics cop. What was cut--and can now be
seen--is Hawke's young policeman returning home and confronting three
of Washington's cronies (Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin and Raymond J.
Barry).</LD>
<TE>   But while the movie itself contains provocative commentary by
director Antoine Fuqua, there isn't a track to go with the unused
ending and other deleted scenes (including one where Washington's
character tries to pick up some women on the street and another in
which Hawke's character reveals that he is part Latino), so viewers
will only be able to speculate about why Fuqua chose to end the film
as he did.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Stiller is more forthcoming on the digital edition of his
comedy "Zoolander," which, in addition to an alternate ending credit
sequence, includes four other deleted scenes and five extended
scenes. All come with explanatory commentary by director-star
Stiller. One of the extended sequences was scheduled to appear in the
film's final sequence and featured David Duchovny, playing a hand
model who believes in government conspiracies. Stiller says he cut
the scene because Duchovny looked different than he did in the rest
of the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Stiller and writer Drake Sather created the character of the
dimwitted model Derek Zoolander as a sketch for the 1996 VH1 Fashion
Awards. The character is very funny as a five-minute bit but wears
thin over 90 minutes. The film also stars Owen Wilson (as Derek's
rival, Hansel), Will Ferrell and Stiller's parents, Jerry Stiller and
Anne Meara.</TE>
<TE>   The disc also features numerous outtakes, trailers and TV spots,
the two original Zoolander VH1 Fashion Awards skits, photo
galleries--including Derek and Hansel's outrageous
portfolios--animated menus hosted by Derek and enjoyable commentary
from Stiller and his co-writers, Sather and John Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And if you really enjoy seeing deleted and extended scenes, grab
the DVD of writer-director Richard Kelly's eerie but sweet
psychological drama "Donnie Darko" (Fox, $30): It has 20 of them,
with optional commentary by Kelly. Most of the scenes were cut for
time, he says, though one very violent sequence that was to have
appeared near the film's conclusion was dropped because it was deemed
too bloody and disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   Another deleted scene has Donnie watching the girl of his dreams,
Christina Applegate of TV's "Married ... With Children." Kelly says
that, originally, Donnie was to be obsessed with Alyssa Milano of
"Who's the Boss?" But Milano's mother threatened to sue if they used
a clip in the movie, he says, so Applegate was substituted.</TE>
<TE>   Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title role in the independent feature--a
brainy but troubled high school student who is visited at night by a
strange, large rabbit named Frank. Jena Malone, Mary McDonnell, Drew
Barrymore (who was also a producer), Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze
also appear.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition includes several of the infomercials featuring
Swayze's character, a music video, trailers and TV spots, a still
gallery, crew bios and two audio commentaries: one with Kelly and
Gyllenhaal and another with Kelly and several of the film's costars.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just a few weeks after the release of "Cinderella II: Dreams Come
True," Disney is back with another made-for-video sequel to one of
its feature animated films, "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" ($25 for
VHS; $30 for DVD). Victor Hugo undoubtedly never imagined that his
tragic hero, Quasimodo, would turn into a fun-loving guy nicknamed
Quasi.</TE>
<TE>   The animation on the new film is uneven, as are the five original
songs. But what this film has going for it are inspired vocal
performances. Just as he did in the 1996 theatrical original, Tom
Hulce brings a real humanity and pathos to the role of Quasimodo.
Also returning from the feature are Kevin Kline as Phoebus, the
captain of the guard, and Demi Moore as Esmeralda. It's Michael
McKean, though, who nearly steals the show as the villain--the very
vain and vile circus master Sarousch, who absconds with Notre Dame's
beautiful bell. Jennifer Love Hewitt is also on hand as Sarousch's
assistant, who falls in love with Quasi.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If you loved Baz Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge," you'll definitely want
to check out his first film, 1992's "Strictly Ballroom," which
arrived this week on DVD (Miramax, $30). It's a unique, colorful and
delightful Australian romance about a championship ballroom dancer
(the dashing Paul Mercurio) who, in dire need of a new partner, teams
up with an ugly duckling (Tara Morice). Under his guidance, she
transforms into a swan.</TE>
<TE>   The lovely digital edition includes the quirky documentary on
ballroom dancing in Australia that inspired the film, "Samba to Slow
Fox"; several deleted scenes; a still gallery and a commentary track
with Luhrmann, his production designer wife, Catherine Martin, and
the film's choreographer, John "Cha Cha" O'Connell.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   During the height of the Depression in the 1930s, mop-top Shirley
Temple sang and danced everyone's troubles away in such movies as
"Curly Top," "Poor Little Rich Girl" and "Rebecca of Sunnybrook
Farm."</TE>
<TE>   Fox is commemorating the 70th anniversary of Temple's show
business debut with the DVD release of three of her vintage films
($20 each): 1934's "Bright Eyes," in which she introduced the song
"On the Good Ship Lollipop"; 1936's "Dimples"; and 1937's "Heidi."
All the films have been digitally restored, and viewers have the
option of seeing the film in the original black-and-white or the
inferior colorized version. The "Heidi" disc includes the original
trailer.</TE>

<HD>Pickering Didn't Get 'Lynched,' and We Shouldn't Say That
He Did</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA R. MONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Karl Rove, President Bush's chief political advisor, and Sen. Orrin
G. Hatch (R-Utah) have called the Senate Judiciary Committee's defeat
of Judge Charles W. Pickering for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals
a lynching.</LD>
<LD>   "Lynching," like "Holocaust," is a word that should not be used
gratuitously.</LD>
<LD>   The word has special meaning to native Mississippians like
Pickering and me. From 1882 to 1944, there were about 4,700 lynchings
in the United States; Mississippi led the nation with 573. Of
Mississippi's victims, 93% were African American.</LD>
<TE>   Here's how my hometown paper, the Vicksburg Evening Post,
described a 1904 lynching of Luther Holbert and his wife, accused of
killing Holbert's employer:</TE>
<TE>   "When the two Negroes were captured, they were tied to trees and
while the funeral pyres were being prepared, they were forced to
suffer the most fiendish tortures. The blacks were forced to hold out
their hands while one finger at a time was chopped off. The fingers
were distributed as souvenirs. The ears of the murderers were cut
off. Holbert was beaten severely, his skull was fractured and one of
his eyes, knocked out with a stick, hung by a shred from the
socket....</TE>
<TE>   "The most excruciating form of punishment consisted in the use of
a large corkscrew in the hands of some of the mob. This instrument
was bored into the flesh of the man and woman, in the arms, legs and
body, and then pulled out, the spirals tearing out big pieces of raw,
quivering flesh every time it was withdrawn."</TE>
<TE>   Future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas started us down this
path of gratuitous use of the word lynching when he called the sexual
harassment accusations of law professor Anita Hill "a high-tech
lynching." But the proper word for citizens airing their concerns
about judicial nominees who will have lifetime jobs is not lynching
but democracy.</TE>
<TE>   To understand the real meaning of lynching, get a copy of the 2000
book, "Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America." People
once attended lynchings as entertainment and sent their relatives
picture postcards of the events. One of the most compelling photos is
of a 1930 double lynching in Indiana. There's a young couple laughing
in the foreground and a man with a Hitler-style mustache pointing at
the swinging bodies. A lock of the victim's hair was framed along
with the photograph.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the concern over Pickering's nomination was his history on
racial issues. Opponents accused him of lying under oath about his
connection to Mississippi's infamous Sovereignty Commission, which
writer Willie Morris referred to as "a sort of boondocks Gestapo."
Supporters--including a local leader of the National Assn. for the
Advancement of Colored People--pointed to Pickering's testimony
against the Ku Klux Klan in a murder trial, which cost him reelection
as a prosecutor. These were legitimate questions that deserved a full
hearing, which is why the Constitution gives the Senate the power to
approve judicial nominations.</TE>
<TE>   I would be the last person to say a racist can't be rehabilitated.
When my grade school was integrated in 1970, I was one of the most
racist 12-year-olds you could imagine. I made it clear to my black
classmates that they were unwelcome and inferior. Fortunately, they
didn't listen.</TE>
<TE>   Much was made in the press of Pickering's role on the board of the
Institute for Racial Reconciliation at the University of Mississippi,
my alma mater. An essential part of racial reconciliation is coming
to terms with the brutality of slavery and the state-sponsored
terrorism inflicted on African Americans for at least a century
afterward. This does not mean we should live in the past, but we
can't whitewash it either. Pickering should be the first to admit
that he was in no way "lynched." It's important to remember what a
real lynching is.</TE>

<HD>Priest Scandal Could Set History in Motion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will every one of the 195 Catholic diocese in the United States be
tainted by the priest-pedophilia scandal? Probably. Will
investigators, prosecutors and trial lawyers pick through every new
and old allegation? Absolutely. Will more priests end up in jail?
Obviously. And will huge financial settlements push the American
church toward bankruptcy? Quite possibly.</LD>
<LD>   A huge historical wheel is turning. The Catholic Church in the
United States, which created its first diocese in St. Augustine,
Fla., in 1565, is going to be transformed; call it the
Episcopalianization of the Roman Church.</LD>
<LD>   What does that mean? In 1534, Henry VIII of England, furious at
the pope for refusing to grant him a divorce, took control of the
Catholic Church in his kingdom; he named himself "supreme head on
Earth of the Church of England." That was anathema, literally.</LD>
<TE>   The organizational essence of the church is that all believers
follow the guidance of the bishop of Rome, who, in the words of the
Dogmatic Constitution, is recognized as "the perpetual and visible
source of and foundation of the unity of the bishops and the
multitude of the faithful."</TE>
<TE>   So Pope Clement VII excommunicated Henry, and a minor civil war
swept across England for the next two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, other issues were involved, too. All across
16th-century Northern Europe, a backlash had been building against
the corruption, arrogance and, yes, sexual abuses of the church.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander VI, pope from 1492 to 1503, flaunted his four children.
In Germany, a defrocked priest, Martin Luther, had already given
voice to what would become known as the Reformation.</TE>
<TE>   And so back in England, King Henry had plenty of support for his
oftentimes ruthless anti-Catholic campaign, in which monasteries were
burned, church lands were seized and dissenters such as Sir Thomas
More were executed.</TE>
<TE>   It was a triumph for civil authority; the new Church of England,
which Henry called "reformed," was in fact totally subservient to the
British nation-state.</TE>
<TE>   And to this day, the formal title for the monarch of Britain
includes defender of the faith--as in defender of the Church of
England against a Catholic comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Episcopalians, of course, are the American cousins to the Church
of England. And while Episcopalians here are theoretically
spiritually subordinate to the archbishop of Canterbury, England, as
a practical matter, the prelate has minimal authority; American
Episcopalians run their own church.</TE>
<TE>   Which has not been true for American Catholics, who have built up
a vast network of churches, schools and other institutions, all of
which are run from Rome.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say that American Catholics have had no domestic
power; indeed, they have been numerous enough--and certainly
politically potent enough--to create a bureaucratic and dogmatic
structure that could maintain a distinct Catholic identity amid waves
of modernism, sectarianism and ecumenicalism.</TE>
<TE>   But if Catholics have benefited from the upside of hulking
institutional power, they're now discovering the downside, which is
that nontransparent, nonaccountable institutions are subject to the
most vile kinds of corruption.</TE>
<TE>   And it has been the inability, or unwillingness, of the church to
deal with pedophilia over the last few decades that has led to the
current crisis. In the 21st century, as was the case in the 16th
century, if the keepers of an institution can't respond adequately or
adroitly to outside pressure, eventually the outsiders will step in
and do the job themselves.</TE>
<TE>   When the foul smoke of this scandal clears, the American Catholic
Church will have less prestige, less wealth and, most profoundly,
less autonomy.</TE>
<TE>   People joke about cameras in every confessional and rectory, but
the unfunny future reality won't be much different from that. Just as
corrupt unions and bankrupt companies get special masters to
supervise the cleanup, so the church will have state-designated
overseers.</TE>
<TE>   But what of other proposed changes within the church, such as the
ordaining of women or allowing married priests?</TE>
<TE>   Here's a prediction: In the wake of the years, maybe even decades,
of legal-criminal-doctrinal convulsions to come, all those ideas will
be tested on American soil.</TE>
<TE>   And what will happen then? Will a new round of confrontation, and
possibly schism, come between English speakers and the infallible
bishop of Rome?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe. That's how Protestantism, including the Episcopalian
Church, got its start 500 years ago.</TE>

<HD>Even If You Dress It Up, a Kangaroo Is Still a Kangaroo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week, as early as today, the Bush administration will release
the long-awaited rules for its new military tribunals. The rules
contain some significant changes. Officials hope that these
concessions will convince reluctant allies and critics that this is
not the "kangaroo court" that has been portrayed worldwide. However,
these concessions do little to change the structure of the tribunal
as a makeshift court designed to produce predictable convictions.</LD>
<LD>   Ultimately, a court is no better than the material used to
construct it. The administration can add any number of stylish
additions, but even all of the lawyers in the government cannot make
an unconstitutional sow's ear into a constitutional silk purse.</LD>
<LD>   It is important to recognize that the new rules make significant
strides in addressing some of the most outrageous aspects of the
executive order issued in November. The administration has now agreed
to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt as the standard for
conviction. It will allow for a type of appeal. While it will still
allow conviction by a majority vote, it will require unanimity to
impose the death penalty. It will hold trials in open court whenever
possible.</LD>
<TE>   Some of these rules, however, raise more questions than they
answer. The administration previously insisted that it needed an
alternative to the federal courts because of security concerns.
However, the new rules largely mirror the federal courts on rules
governing nonpublic proceedings and the use of classified evidence.
The main differences between the federal and tribunal rules are in
those areas that will help secure convictions rather than secrets.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear that the new rules were written by prosecutors to
govern their own prosecutions. The biggest changes are in areas that
prosecutors find inconvenient, such as proving that evidence is
authentic before using it. Accordingly, tribunal prosecutors will not
have to "authenticate" evidence or even show a chain of custody.
Evidence that would be struck as unreliable in federal court can be
introduced in these tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the bane of every prosecutor's case is the threat of the
appellate court, which tends to be less inhibited in standing up to
the executive branch. Accordingly, the new rules bar appeal to a real
federal judge. Instead, the administration will handpick willing
individuals to serve as ad hoc appellate judges. Just in case of any
misguided sense of justice, these judges will be limited to reviewing
cases under the rules set by the administration and will not be
permitted to apply the U.S. Constitution or federal law. This creates
the mere pretense of legal process.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the rules effectively bar experienced civilian defense
lawyers from representing these defendants. It is always possible
that, even in the most rigged match, a good defense lawyer can
prevail. The defendants can have military defense counsel but must
pay for any civilian counsel--an unlikely prospect for some Talib who
is wearing the full extent of his personal wealth on his back.</TE>
<TE>   Military defense counsel long have been criticized as
inexperienced and often dominated by higher-ranking officers.
Moreover, imposing uniformed counsel on these prisoners will
inevitably chill attorney-client communications, given the
defendants' alleged recent efforts to kill people wearing the same
uniform.</TE>
<TE>   These rules leave the president in a role more reminiscent of a
Caesar than a civil servant. With a gesture, the president can send a
defendant to a real trial or a makeshift trial. Some defendants such
as Zacarias Moussaoui will be sent to federal court to receive a full
trial with paid civilian counsel. Others will be sent back to their
own countries. And some will be sent to Cuba and the tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   This is not what our framers had in mind. Although it is true that
the Supreme Court generally has not applied constitutional
protections to foreign nationals outside our borders, the new
tribunal raises a new and fundamental challenge to the separation of
powers. President Bush has asserted the right to create a wholly
independent judicial system. Not only will the president maintain his
own courts but presumably his own prisons. The assertion of such
authority by a president is dangerous and alien to our system.</TE>
<TE>   The framers expressly denied the president the right to create and
mete out his own form of justice. They created a carefully balanced
government of checks and balances, including an independent
judiciary. They gave the right to create "inferior courts"
exclusively to Congress. Yet the administration has steadfastly
refused to ask for the creation of such a court despite the
willingness of many members to consider it.</TE>
<TE>   It takes more than a few rule changes to remove the "kangaroo"
from the court. One can shampoo and pedicure a kangaroo but it does
little to change the appearance of a president's own private
menagerie of justice.</TE>

<HD>Make Countries Reform to Get U.S. Aid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWARD S. WALKER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time since Sept. 11, the world's leaders have gathered,
in Monterrey, Mexico, at a United Nations summit to seek common means
of relieving the poverty that afflicts billions of people worldwide.
Left untreated or ignored, this poverty makes fertile ground for
instability and the Osama bin Ladens of the world.</LD>
<LD>   Although neglect can have devastating consequences for U.S.
national interests, the Bush administration is right to tie increased
aid to reform and results.</LD>
<LD>   Leading the charge to revamp the U.S. approach to aid is Treasury
Secretary Paul O'Neill. It is O'Neill's unique way with words that
tends to get the attention, while the substance of what he's saying
too often is lost.</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately, his colorful language is backed by rare intellect, a
record of success and several sober studies from the World Bank and
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that have
pointed to the positive impact of aid when used in a sound policy
environment.</TE>
<TE>   Although not specifically linked to O'Neill's arguments, these
studies make a strong case for requiring that certain conditions be
met when granting assistance and targeting aid to governments whose
policies are most conducive to maximizing results.</TE>
<TE>   Such optimal conditions are not found in abundance among the
world's poorest nations. Does that excuse either the donors or
recipients from setting standards? Aid is far too valuable both in
dollar terms and as an incentive for change to waste it
indiscriminately.</TE>
<TE>   There is a long, sad history of aid dollars going into the wrong
pockets. That is bad enough, but the effects are even worse.
Unconditioned assistance too often rewards corruption and bad
economics, and these lead to economic deterioration rather than
growth.</TE>
<TE>   As a former U.S. assistant secretary of State for Near Eastern
affairs, I have some experience with the lost potential of much of
our assistance. Programs administered by the U.S. Agency for
International Development, or USAID, could be an extremely valuable
weapon in our war against disease and hunger and the instability they
breed.</TE>
<TE>   Yet earmarking of appropriations by Congress has led to an
entitlement attitude in some nations, which reduces the
administration's leverage even when it is committed to reform. In
Egypt, for example, we had an aid program that was increasingly
conditioned on reform. But the pressure to disburse funds and the
fear of building up a pipeline of unspent aid, which Congress
deplores, meant we were constantly pressed to ease our conditions,
making them so easy that there was no risk of their not being met.</TE>
<TE>   While the United States has been increasingly wedded to the
concept of conditionality in its assistance programs, that theology
has not fully penetrated the USAID bureaucracy. It is even less
regarded in the European Union, where reform conditions are seldom
tied to aid.</TE>
<TE>   The concepts that O'Neill is promoting are not comforting to aid
professionals in and out of government who seek "feel-good" programs.
But "tough love" may well be a better prescription for the poor of
the world than assistance that only prolongs bad governance.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of results, aid should be withheld, stored up in a
pipeline to provide greater incentive for change. Donors must play an
active role in pushing for conditions that maximize the value of
every aid dollar and also lay the groundwork for increased foreign
investment. The latter is the key to sustained economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Many international business leaders and investors are attending
the conference in Monterrey. They too are interested in aid acting as
a more forceful catalyst for political and economic change in
developing nations.</TE>
<TE>   When such changes occur, countries stop attracting the world's
terrorist operations and start attracting foreign capital instead.</TE>
<TE>   The question remains whether world leaders can agree on a
mechanism for linking aid with economic reform--or even on the urgent
need to take such action.</TE>

<HD>Illness, Enemy of Learning</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Picture a little boy in the first grade with a toothache that feels
like a hole in his head. All he wants is his mother. She's at work,
has no health benefits and can't afford to take her son to a dentist
today or even next week. It's hard to imagine that child being able
to learn.</LD>
<LD>   In California more than half of children ages 6 to 8 suffer at
some point from an untreated dental problem that interrupts their
learning, according to an education study recently released by the
Assembly's Select Committee on California Children's School
Readiness. The report examines the link between good health and early
learning.</LD>
<LD>   Committee Chairwoman Wilma Chan, an Alameda Democrat, sees poor
health in a student's early years as being directly linked to failure
later, especially under California's tough new academic standards.
She is sponsoring a legislative package that would focus on improving
health from infancy through 8 years old, the age by which children
should be reading well.</LD>
<TE>   The nine bills in their current form would automatically enroll
newborns from poor families in Medi-Cal for a year instead of two
months, seek funding for dental care for children, promote good
nutrition, provide mental health services, train teachers to flag
health problems early and create a state department of children's
services modeled after the California Department on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   California's budget deficit discourages expensive remedies, but
Chan believes that with little additional money the state could
encourage greater cooperation between providers of existing
services--such as county mental health departments--and school
districts. She supports phasing in her proposals to spread the costs.</TE>
<TE>   It's unlikely that Chan will get approval for her whole package,
but she is on the right track. To those who protest that a child's
health is a parental responsibility, we say that schools have to deal
with what's in front of them. Increasingly, that includes emotional
health problems of very young children.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly study found that nearly half of the state's
kindergarten teachers report that "half or more of their students
come to school with social or emotional problems that impede
success." One of five schoolchildren has a treatable mental health
problem, according to information from the U.S. surgeon general cited
in the report. When illnesses such as depression go untreated,
children are more likely to withdraw or disrupt class and get stuck
with a "troublemaker" label that follows them from grade to grade.</TE>
<TE>   Vision problems also prevent many children from actively
participating at school. California requires a basic eye-chart test
for nearsightedness in the primary grades, but other deficiencies may
go undetected for years. A principal in a school district near San
Jose told the committee that he ordered vision tests for 400 failing
ninth-graders; 200 needed glasses. A working mother who spoke at a
hearing in Salinas said that because getting the proper care took too
long, an eye infection caused her daughter to lose part of her
vision.</TE>
<TE>   Even head lice can keep children out of school for months when
they are passed back and forth within a family. Few children can miss
that much school and keep up.</TE>
<TE>   A student's distraction because of a toothache or a long absence
with an infestation of lice is impossible to accept because it is so
fixable. If better cooperation between state agencies and school
districts can begin to solve such problems, achieve it now.</TE>

the fragility of hopes for peace in the Middle East. Continued talks
demonstrated the persistence of those hopes.</LD>
<LD>   After weeks of ever-harsher violence, diplomacy seemed finally to
be gaining some traction this week, helped in great measure by the
Bush administration's belated reengagement in the shattered peace
process. Then a suicide bomber killed himself and seven other
passengers on a bus in northern Israel. Despite the murders,
Palestinian and Israeli security officials continued discussing a
formal cease-fire, evidence of a new sense of urgency. Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon made a welcome tactical change earlier this
month when he dropped his impossible condition that there be seven
days free of violence by any Palestinian group before he would
discuss a cease-fire. He also ended the virtual house arrest of
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat and said he would let
Arafat attend next week's Beirut meeting of Arab leaders to discuss a
Saudi Arabian proposal for Middle East peace. Also helpful was
Israeli soldiers' withdrawal from the towns they stormed in the
occupied territories this month in the largest military campaign in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the 1967 Middle East war.</LD>
<TE>   Sharon's flexibility came amid Bush administration criticism of
Israel's military campaign, ample proof of the worth of continued
U.S. engagement no matter how bleak the immediate prospect. Now,
again, the burden is on Arafat. The man who has fumbled so many
opportunities to improve the lives of Palestinians should seize this
one.</TE>
<TE>   CIA Director George J. Tenet mapped out a security plan last year
requiring Israel to stop assassinating Palestinians it considered
terrorists. In turn, Palestinians would have to arrest militants and
disarm their militias. Arafat retains the power to crack down on
militias allied with his Fatah organization; he also needs to visibly
pressure the more radical groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which
claimed responsibility for Wednesday's suicide bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney made a generous offer to meet with
Arafat if the Palestinians implemented the Tenet plan. That's a key
shift away from the Bush administration's hands-off attitude toward
the Palestinian leader. Cheney's three meetings with Sharon in fewer
than 18 hours and the arrival in Israel last week of U.S. envoy
Anthony C. Zinni point up the Bush administration's renewed
understanding of Washington's role, after a period on the sidelines
as violence escalated.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's King Abdullah II spoke movingly during his Los Angeles
visit this week about how both Israelis and Palestinians fear to eat
in restaurants and even send their children to school. The king spoke
of "these basic human problems that we as leaders tend to ignore."</TE>
<TE>   Israelis are exhausted. Palestinians are exhausted. Given a vision
of hope by their leaders, both populations may be ready to grasp it.</TE>

<HD>Here's to Campaign Reform</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took seven years of bickering for Congress to pass campaign
finance reform, but the final fight wasn't even close. The Senate's
historic 60-40 vote approving the Shays-Meehan bill banning "soft
money" showed that even political pragmatists can become reformers
when inspired by public outrage.</LD>
<LD>   And, boy, was the public mad, thanks in part to revelations about
the attempts of failed energy giant Enron to buy goodwill and
influence. Now President Bush too has seen the light and indicated he
will sign the bill.</LD>
<LD>   It can't happen soon enough. In 1974, rattled by the Watergate
scandal, Congress passed election reform intended to limit the
influence of wealthy corporations and individuals. But the system was
undermined by soft money--unregulated donations that corporations,
unions and individuals were allowed to make to party organizations.
Congress and presidential candidates became addicted to it. In the
2000 election, Democrats and Republicans together raised almost $500
million of the insidious stuff.</LD>
<TE>   Foes of campaign finance reform, including Sen. Mitch McConnell
(R-Ky.), thought they could endlessly stall efforts to close this
lucrative loophole. But McConnell's threats to filibuster the bill
went nowhere, and it passed intact. So now he will challenge
Shays-Meehan in court, arguing that it would unconstitutionally limit
the right to free speech.</TE>
<TE>   We think that argument is spurious and hope the courts do too.
Meanwhile, the next move for those who want to fix the system will be
to strengthen, or replace, the Federal Election Commission. The
opponents of campaign finance reform are right about one thing:
Lawyers will be able to evade restrictions. But not if a beefed-up
commission polices the reforms from the outset.</TE>
<TE>   These, however, are considerations for the future. For now, voters
can celebrate a victory over the forces that have corrupted and
polluted national politics.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Execs to Make Bid for Piece of Global</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of former top executives of Frontier Corp. unveiled plans
Wednesday to bid for the U.S. portion of Global Crossing Ltd.'s
communications network.</LD>
<LD>   The group is led by Anthony J. Cassara, who was president of the
carrier business at Frontier and then at Global Crossing after it
acquired Frontier. Cassara has run his own telecommunications
consulting group since leaving Global Crossing nearly two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Cassara said the group has not hashed out the financial details,
but is considering teaming up with other investors to buy and run the
part of Global Crossing's network once run by Frontier.</LD>
<TE>   The group does not plan to bid for the entire company, which filed
for bankruptcy protection in late January.</TE>
<TE>   "If they are going to entertain offers for parts of the business,
then I think we're going to have a good presentation," Cassara said.
"This team that we put together is essentially the team that built
and ran that [$2-billion] business."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, a Global Crossing shareholder group hoping to
revive the company demanded information about the connections between
Global Crossing officials and two potential Asian investors.</TE>
<TE>   The shareholder group, which is represented by investment firm KAB
Group, asked the company to provide within 30 days "all it knows
about any past or present relationships" between company officers and
anybody associated with Hutchison Whampoa Limited and Singapore
Technologies Telemedia.</TE>
<TE>   In late January, Hutchison and STT agreed to invest $750 million
in return for a 79% stake in the reorganized company. As part of the
letter of intent, Global Crossing agreed to pay $10 million in
expenses for the two Asian firms, as well as a breakup fee of at
least $40 million if the deal doesn't proceed.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing spokeswoman Cynthia Artin said the company
"intends to assist in any way we can."</TE>
<TE>   The KAB request comes as new questions are being raised about the
involvement of auditor Andersen in the now-controversial accounting
practices at Global Crossing, Qwest Communications International and
other telecommunications firms.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen issued a "white paper" for use by its clients and others,
advising them how to record network capacity "swaps" between
carriers. Critics say the method that became standard practice is
misleading because it overstates revenue and spreads the
corresponding costs over many years.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear who wrote the Andersen paper. Joseph Perrone, a
former partner at the auditing firm, had written earlier memos about
the accounting practices at issue. Perrone was Global Crossing's main
contact at Andersen for several years before he became a financial
executive at Global Crossing.</TE>

<LD>The sheets, towels and kids' clothing made by Martha Stewart and
Disney will stay on Kmart shelves after the discount retailer
received Bankruptcy Court approval to continue its licensing
agreements with its five major brands.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Susan Pierson Sonderby approved Kmart's
request to continue its licensing agreements and pay outstanding
accounts with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.; Disney
Enterprises Inc.; G.H. Productions Inc., which supplies its Jaclyn
Smith line; Joe Boxer Licensing; and Kathy Ireland World Wide.</LD>
<LD>   Kmart owes $131,735 to Kathy Ireland, $1.1 million to G.H.
Productions and $12.3 million to Martha Stewart.</LD>
<TE>   Kmart Chairman and Chief Executive James B. Adamson said getting
the judge's approval was a key victory for the discount retailer in
its restructuring efforts. The five brands account for about $2.7
billion annually in gross sales.</TE>

<LD>* UAL Corp.'s United Airlines joined other carriers in saying it no
longer would pay base commissions for tickets to travel agents in the
United States and Canada.</LD>
<LD>   * Contract negotiations between United Airlines and its 23,000
ramp and public contact workers broke off. The union asked federal
mediators to formally declare an impasse, clearing the way for a
possible strike.</LD>
<LD>   * America West Holdings Corp., an airline company that hasn't made
a profit since mid-2000, said it will have first-quarter costs of as
much as $347 million for restructuring, lower plane values and an
accounting change.</LD>
<TE>   * Chiquita Brands Inc. said Chief Executive Steven Warshaw
resigned after leading the banana producer through a Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization. Warshaw was replaced by Cyrus Freidheim,
66, who is retiring as vice chairman of Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. at

<TE>   * International Paper Co. and Weyerhaeuser Co., the world's

analysts said. Domtar Inc. and Boise Cascade Corp. also plan to
increase the price of uncoated paper.</TE>
<TE>   * Guidebook publisher Lonely Planet said it planned to cut 75
jobs, or 15% of its work force, citing slumps in travel and the
global economy as well as the high cost of doing business in the San
Francisco Bay Area. Most of the cuts will be made at the firm's U.S.
operations in Oakland, as the company consolidates production at its

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration announced a broad effort to track and combat
tax shelters constructed by corporations and wealthy individuals.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals by the Treasury Department were released ahead of a
Senate Finance Committee hearing today on tax shelters. The committee
also is investigating whether Enron Corp. escaped taxes by creating
hundreds of offshore affiliates.</LD>
<LD>   Actions the Treasury Department plans to take include
strengthening requirements that these transactions are disclosed to
the Internal Revenue Service and extending the rules beyond
corporations to include partnerships, trusts and high-income
individuals.</LD>
<TE>   The package would simplify which transactions must be disclosed,
impose stiffer civil penalties for failure to do so and no longer
permit marketers of shelters to evade the rules by calling themselves
"advisors" rather than "promoters" of such schemes.</TE>

<HD>Court Upholds Dues by College Employees</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A California law requiring thousands of university and college
employees to pay union dues has survived a series of lawsuits
sponsored by the Virginia-based National Right to Work Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   The group on Monday lost an appeal in the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals in a case against the California Faculty Assn., which
represents 20,000 faculty members in the California State University
system.</LD>
<LD>   The litigation initially was against 20 unions representing 93,000
employees, all of whom were forced to pay at least a "fair share" of
union dues under a law signed two years ago by Gov. Gray Davis. That
share is the amount that goes directly to collective bargaining and
contract administration, not political work.</LD>
<TE>   Before the law, a majority of covered employees opted not to pay
dues. Attorney Glenn Rothner, who represented the faculty
association, said the union gained bargaining clout under the new law
and was thus able to sign its best contract earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Foundation Vice President Stefan Gleason said the group was
considering an appeal to the Supreme Court.</TE>

<LD>Taxpayers would get an extra 15 days to file their income tax returns
if they do it electronically under legislation approved by the House
Ways and Means Committee.</LD>
<LD>   The Treasury Department estimates that enactment of the
legislation would prompt 4 million more taxpayers to file their
returns electronically. The bill would change the April 15 filing and
payment deadline for the first time since 1954. Taxpayers who file
and pay electronically would have until April 30 to get their returns
to the IRS.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FedEx Corp. said fiscal third-quarter profit rose 11% because it
shipped more packages by truck and carried more mail for the U.S.
Postal Service.</LD>
<LD>   Net income for the period ended Feb. 28 climbed to $120million, or
39 cents a share, from $108 million, or 37 cents, a year earlier.
Sales increased 3.7% to $5.02 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Shipments rose 21% at Fed- Ex Ground because it delivered more
goods ordered via the Internet during the holidays. The unit is
taking package shipments from the Postal Service and United Parcel
Service Inc. as it offers new products and more business customers
switch from air delivery to less expensive shipments by truck during
the recession, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Results beat analysts' average forecast of 37 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Memphis, Tenn.-based FedEx fell 93 cents to close at
$56.80 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>General Mills Inc. said its fiscal third-quarter net income fell 48%
to $82.5 million, or 22 cents a share, as it faced sharply higher
costs and sales disruptions after its October acquisition of bakery
company Pillsbury. The company's operating earnings were 28 cents a
share, in line with the company's lowered guidance in February.</LD>
<LD>   Sales rose 82% to $3.1 billion, boosted by incremental sales from
the Pillsbury businesses.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's comforting to hear that our security czar Tom Ridge had
"countless" conversations with lots of agencies before coming up with
the color-coded warning system so proudly unveiled the other day. It
would have been nice if, instead of getting just the right color, he
had landed on the various departments and agencies with both feet!
The FAA, the departments of Transportation and Health and Human
Services, the INS, etc., are all dragging their feet for various
reasons--usually something to do with interfering with commerce or
business or profits.</LD>
<LD>   Yep, it would have been nice, except that Ridge has no power. The
Bush administration, in another demonstration of its, so far,
cosmetic and diverting war on terrorism, saw fit to not make Ridge a
Cabinet member. As a result, he cannot make the sweeping changes in
our immigration regulations, airport security measures, in-flight
defensive measures and border protection that are needed to
effectively protect our nation from various fanatics and zealots. All
he can do is suggest and advise.</LD>
<LD>   OK, President Bush, prove that your stirring utterances are not
mere political and partisan gamesmanship. Give Ridge the power he
needs to get the job done.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bush Proposes Major Boost in Development Aid," March 15:</LD>
<LD>   President Bush is to be lauded for wanting to increase development
aid to poor countries by $5 billion. However, development without
population stabilization and sustainable use of resources is
meaningless. He is to be castigated for using his "ax of evil" in
chopping off our country's contribution to the United Nations
Population Fund, which offers family planning and reproductive health
care, battles transmission of HIV and monitors violence against women
and children, particularly in refugee camps in areas of conflict.
This move was brainlessly political and is not helping our reputation
among our allies or in the world's poorest countries.</LD>

<LD>Your March 14 article on monkeys with brain implants used to control
computers by the monkeys' thought alone was interesting. I wonder if
the brain researchers at Brown University have considered what should
happen to these brave little monkeys in this new world of medical
marvels they're bringing about after their "service" to science is
done.</LD>
<LD>   Do they get any reward, a retirement free of repeated medical
experiments on their brains? Or are they "sacrificed" at the end of
their service? Or made to submit again and again to experiments until
they're used up? I hope one day the monkeys, since they can think,
learn how to use those computers to persuade us that this new world
of medical miracles can't help us if we've lost all compassion.</LD>

<LD>It's bad enough that for two years the people in this area had to put
up with the construction for the white elephant called Hollywood &amp;
Highland--you know, the place that charges $1 every 20 minutes to
park. But now idiot city officials are closing the street down for a
week for the Academy Awards.</LD>
<LD>   Why? Security? Please, this is not downtown at the Shrine
Auditorium, where nothing happens at night in the area anyway, and no
one minds. There are businesses and residents living here. Hello? We
can't even take the Highland Avenue offramp to get home. All you need
to do is close Hollywood Boulevard down for one day. If the city is
going to do this every year, it can take take the awards back to the
Shrine. Note to the academy: You are important and fun, but get over
yourself.</LD>

<LD>Re "Boston's Official Catholic Newspaper Questions Celibacy Policy
for Priests," March 16: Pedophilia is a mental disorder/illness and
has nothing to do with sexuality. Homosexuality is not a mental
disorder. Statistically, the profile of a pedophiliac is male, white
and heterosexual. We all need to understand and remember that
pedophilia is not even a remote cousin of homosexuality.</LD>
<LD>   As for whether the Catholic Church "attracts a disproportionate
number of men with a homosexual orientation"--why is that an issue?
Who cares? Celibacy is celibacy. Does it matter which gender you
don't engage in sex with? And whether they are "straight" or
homosexual, celibate or not, most of the priests I have known in my
50-plus years of life have been extremely good men, priests and
pastors. That's all I care about.</LD>
<LD>   An adult in a high-level position of trust and responsibility
cannot be left free to prey on children. But this "cleaning house" in
the Catholic Church is bordering on a witch hunt.</LD>

<TE>   Re "L.A. Priests Anguished, Angry Over Sex Scandals," March 16:
Catholic priests feel picked on? Guilt by association or simply
guilt? If Roman Catholic priests feel attacked, maybe it's a
counterattack for the widespread wrongdoing among the priesthood
about which they have been aware but have been too unethical to
address. Picked on? Try moral indignation to describe the response of
the laity and the public.</TE>

<TE>   Priests are lamenting that they can't hug children anymore. Join
the club! Ever since McMartin, teachers can't hug children either.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps if the Catholic Church had not hidden its molesting
priests like moles underground, the priests wouldn't be crying like
babies today. To me, pedophilia is one of the most heinous crimes,
but priest-pedophilia, under the guise of sanctimony, is the worst.</TE>

<LD>You really did not do your homework for your March 13 editorial about
flunking students at Pacific Palisades Charter High School after
teachers record six unexcused absences. Your stance on this issue
smacks of the same simplistic thinking that led to "three strikes"
laws. I have spent 33 years as a teacher, counselor and administrator
for the Los Angeles Unified School District, where I watched this
same solution for truancy debated by teachers, parents and
administrators. At no time was this quick fix implemented after its
consequences were fully explored.</LD>
<LD>   What do you think happens to students who are "automatically"
flunked in a class after six unexcused absences? Do you think that
they will dutifully return and audit the class for no credit? Do you
think that the schools can just baby-sit these students while they
wait for a new semester to begin or send them unsupervised to the
streets?</LD>
<LD>   The real solution is to deal with each student and his or her
parents about the truancy problem. It takes time, counseling and
follow-through to achieve the desired changes, but it can be done.</LD>

<LD>Re "Albuquerque Battles to Leave Arsenic in the Water," March 18: I
was appalled to read how Albuquerque politicians would rather leave
cancer-causing arsenic in their water than pay to adhere to new
federal standards. It just proves that only money makes this world go
'round. Albuquerque's mayor said, "We're not aware of people dropping
off from arsenic poisoning." Apparently, it seems he would rather
have people die first, before he will agree to adopt the tougher EPA
standards. And neither the EPA nor the federal government is willing
to help offset the expenses to provide the cleaner water. Shouldn't
people's lives be the focus of these politicians?</LD>

<HD>Illegal Immigrants Depress Low-End Wages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rising congressional tide against amnesty for some 8.7 million
illegal aliens is proof that lawmakers are increasingly skeptical of
beguiling statements from people like Frank del Olmo who characterize
this controversy as "the INS spending way too much time and effort
chasing down Mexican busboys and farm workers" (Commentary, March
17).</LD>
<LD>   The blanket amnesty sought by Mexican President Vicente Fox makes
no sense for the U.S. By and large, amnesty applies to illegal
Mexican workers who are overwhelmingly unskilled. By increasing the
supply of unskilled labor, Mexican illegals have reduced the wages of
unskilled American workers who lack high school educations. Currently
8.7 million illegal aliens directly compete with 10 million
uneducated and unskilled Americans for the same jobs. All they do is
reduce wages for the poorest Americans. There's no evidence that the
U.S. has a shortage of unskilled workers that needs to be satisfied
by illegal immigrants.</LD>
<TE>   The past couple of decades have taught us that high-tech countries
like the U.S. place a premium on an educated and skilled work force.
Such economies don't create vast arrays of well-paying menial jobs to
be filled by the unskilled and uneducated, as exemplified by most
illegal immigrants. Mexican illegal immigration acts as a subsidy to
businesses that employ unskilled workers--holding down labor costs
and preventing plant modernization--while taxpayers pick up the costs
($5 billion annually in California) to provide educational, birth and
welfare services to 3.5 million illegal immigrants in this state.</TE>
<TE>   Starting with the certainty that another amnesty will spur on
millions more illegal immigrants, there's not a single issue in this
pro-amnesty controversy that makes the slightest bit of sense.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Scott</TE>
<TE>   Glendora</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Swiss watch that's still running can't be repaired, and fixing
the INS except with a temporary moratorium won't work either ("INS on
Long Slide Before Visa Fiasco," March 17). With millions of
immigrants, refugees and others who barge in unannounced, the real
problem is too many bodies flooding in. The answer is a halt until we
catch up with past demands. Then a fair and efficient policy can be
implemented.</TE>

<LD>Re "Calling In Bad Teen Drivers," March 19: My daughter turned 16 in
January and this month received her provisional license. For those
unfamiliar with the byzantine regulations imposed upon new drivers,
this means she can drive by herself but without other kids in the car
for the next six months.</LD>
<LD>   For years, when I drove her to school, the most frightening part
of the day was when I dropped her off or picked her up. Vehicles
entered parking areas occupied by children as young as 5 going the
wrong way while ignoring stop signs or at speeds in excess of those
lawful on the street. The drivers of these vehicles were drinking
coffee, reading the paper, chatting on the phone, applying makeup,
eating breakfast or continuing a conversation with a similar driver
in an adjacent vehicle. In all instances the aforementioned vehicles
were operated by persons 30 or older. Even in this well-to-do
community these drivers were unable to afford vehicles equipped with
turn indicators and/or front license plates and/or license plates
issued by this state. Or did they just not use them?</LD>

program to soccer moms and dads?</LD>

<LD>A New York congressman asked the Justice Department to examine
allegations that entertainment giant Clear Channel Communications is
undercutting a major rival in the concert industry.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Anthony D. Weiner (D-New York), a member of the House
Judiciary Committee, urged antitrust officials to examine the recent
sale of New York promotion firm Metropolitan Entertainment to veteran
concert executive Mitch Slater.</LD>
<LD>   Weiner said Clear Channel, after losing a bid to buy Metropolitan,
moved to purchase one of the company's biggest assets--a contract to
promote events at a Pennsylvania amphitheater--before Slater could
take the reins. Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills), had
previously asked the department to examine alleged anti-competitive
practices by San Antonio-based radio conglomerate Clear Channel. A
Justice Department representative did not return calls.</LD>
<TE>   A Clear Channel spokesman said losing the bidding for Metropolitan
and securing the amphitheater deal were "in no way related."
Officials overseeing the publicly owned amphitheater have said they
asked Clear Channel to take over the building.</TE>

<HD>Five Chip Makers to Work on Semiconductors</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toshiba Corp., NEC Corp. and three other Japanese chip makers will
jointly develop technology that will shrink the size of
semiconductors and boost efficiency, part of a move to compete
against foreign rivals. With the aid of government money, Toshiba,
NEC, Hitachi Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. will
work together to shrink the size of the circuitry on semiconductors,
packing more functions and information-handling capacity on smaller
pieces of silicon wafers.</LD>
<LD>   The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the five companies
will choose one domestic factory to build labs and
prototype-producing lines as early as May. The ministry will spend
$238 million to buy equipment for the factory but has no intention of
owning shares in the venture. Each chip maker is spending millions to
shrink circuit features on chips, a process typically requiring huge
investments in research and development.</LD>

<LD>Deutsche Telekom, failing to reduce its $55-billion debt as fast as
planned, will lower spending and slash dividend payments as it seeks
to limit possible cuts to its credit ratings.</LD>
<LD>   The phone company will trim investment in new networks by about
10% this year, Chief Financial Officer Karl-Gerhard Eick said. The
company will miss a target to cut debt to $44 billion this year.</LD>
<LD>   Deutsche Telekom, like rival France Telecom, amassed debt with
acquisitions and the purchase of wireless phone permits.</LD>

<HD>Charter May Not Use Microsoft for Set Tops</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charter Communications Inc. said it might not use Microsoft software
in new set-top boxes. The cable TV company is testing software to use
in set-top boxes made by Motorola Inc., said spokesman Andy Morgan.
He declined to name what other software Charter is studying. Charter
wants to have the new set-top boxes available in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 4 U.S. cable operator last month announced plans to use
new equipment for services that let customers watch one TV show while
recording and storing others on a computer disk. That marked a
reversal from last year, when Charter said it planned to use
Microsoft's software in as many as 1 million homes over seven years.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis-based Charter is concerned that the Microsoft box isn't
capable of performing as many tasks as it would like. On Nasdaq,
Microsoft shares fell $2.13 to $60.10 and Charter fell 32 cents to
$13.04.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Cisco Systems Inc. stands to lose at least $200 million if
fiber-optic network builder Velocita Corp. files for bankruptcy,
analysts said. San Jose-based Cisco invested $485million in cash and
loans last year to help launch Velocita.</LD>
<LD>   In February, the unprofitable Virginia-based company said it would
fire 75% of its 240 workers and was considering "strategic
alternatives."</LD>
<LD>   Cisco never disclosed in regulatory filings its $200-million
investment in or its $285-million loan to Velocita. Cisco shares fell
72 cents to $16.02 on Nasdaq.</LD>

<LD>Albert E. Jeffcoat, co-founder of the Manhattan Theatre Club and a
former Paris bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal, died March 10
at his home on Puget Sound in Washington after battling colon cancer.
He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffcoat conceived the theater group in 1969 to specialize in
presenting original works by such rising playwrights as Donald
Margulies and Terrence McNally. It also supported new works by
writers Athol Fugard and Arthur Miller.</LD>
<LD>   Originally an off-off-Broadway showcase, it has become one of the
country's most acclaimed theater groups, featuring seven plays a year
on two stages with the support of 20,000 subscribers.</LD>
<TE>   Jeffcoat, also a former corporate executive and author, worked for
the Wall Street Journal in London and was its Paris bureau chief in
1954-55. He later worked in corporate public relations for IBM and
Ford Motor Co., then started his own New York firm, Jeffcoat, Schoen
&amp; Morrell.</TE>
<TE>   He served as chairman of the Manhattan Theatre Club's board from
its founding in 1970 to 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffcoat turned to book writing after he moved to the Pacific
Northwest in 1993 to be closer to several of his six children.</TE>
<TE>   His first book, "Spirited Americans: A Commentary on America's
Optimists From the Puritans to the Cyber-Century," was published in
1999.</TE>

<LD>John Erickson, 72, an academic expert on the Soviet Union and the Red
Army, died Feb. 10 in Edinburgh, Scotland. The cause of death was not
reported.</LD>
<LD>   Erickson became interested in the Soviet army while serving with
the British army in Austria.</LD>
<LD>   "One morning I virtually blundered onto a Soviet armored column,
replete with tanks and riflemen," Erickson told an interviewer some
years ago. "Both the men and the machines made an indelible
impression on me, combining as they did stark contrast between
crudity and sophistication. The inadvertent meeting left me with
impressions, images and a persistent curiosity that could not be
stifled."</LD>
<TE>   After leaving the army, Erickson resumed his study at St. John's
College, Cambridge, and began studying Soviet and Russian military
matters.</TE>
<TE>   He was the author of "The Soviet High Command 1918-1941,"
published in 1962; "The Road to Stalingrad" (1975) and "The Road to
Berlin" (1982).</TE>
<TE>   The distinguished British historian A.J.P. Taylor described "The
Road to Stalingrad" as "the outstanding book on the Soviet war in any
language."</TE>

<HD>John Robson, 71; Export-Import Bank Leader Served 4
Presidents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John E. Robson, the president and chairman of the Export-Import Bank
of the United States, a government-held corporation that helps U.S.
businesses compete abroad as they export goods and services, died of
cancer Wednesday at his home in Washington, D.C. He was 71.</LD>
<LD>   Robson, a former chief executive at major corporations, had held
top government positions intermittently since the late 1960s in
agencies covering transportation and banking.</LD>
<LD>   He was known for a strict attitude toward streamlining operations
in the public and private sectors. Part of his role at Export-Import
was to make it more firmly aligned with the current administration's
trade policy team.</LD>
<TE>   It helped that Robson had strong connections to the Bush
administration. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was a high school
classmate, and the two worked closely together as executives at the
pharmaceutical giant G.D. Searle &amp; Co. in the 1970s and '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said in a statement Wednesday that Robson was "a man of true
character and integrity" and "set an example of distinguished public
service."</TE>
<TE>   Robson took over the Export-Import Bank's top position in May
2001, replacing James A. Harmon, who resigned.</TE>
<TE>   The bank, started during the Depression in 1934, encourages
commercial lenders to make loans to U.S. businesses that export their
wares and provides loans to foreign buyers of American goods.</TE>
<TE>   John Edwin Robson, a New York native, grew up in Chicago, where
his father owned a paint manufacturing company. With Rumsfeld, he
went to New Trier High School in Winnetka, Ill. He was a 1952
graduate of Yale University and a cum laude 1955 graduate of Harvard
University law school.</TE>
<TE>   He served two years in the Army after law school and then returned
to Chicago to practice corporate law.</TE>
<TE>   Although active in Republican politics in Illinois, Robson was
recruited to work for President Johnson by Joseph A. Califano Jr., a
Harvard roommate who later became secretary of health, education and
welfare. He joined the new Transportation Department in 1967 and was
undersecretary when he returned to private practice in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   He was asked back into government service as chairman of the Civil
Aeronautics Board under President Ford. He played a role in crafting
what became the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, ending decades of
federal control over airlines.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, he joined Illinois-based G.D. Searle &amp; Co., then run by
Rumsfeld. Robson became president and later chief executive of the
firm, which cut expenses and began marketing its popular NutraSweet
sugar substitute.</TE>
<TE>   In Atlanta from 1986 to 1988, he was dean and professor of
management at Emory University's business administration school,
where he changed its tenure policy and hired new instructors.</TE>
<TE>   Robson again came back to public service under the first President
Bush in 1989 as deputy secretary of the Treasury Department. He
worked on savings and loan rescue legislation and Eastern European
economic reform after the fall of communist rule.</TE>
<TE>   He was an investment banker and senior advisor at Robertson
Stephens Co. in San Francisco when President Bush nominated him for
the Export-Import Bank last year.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife of 41 years, Margaret, of Washington; a
son, Douglas, of San Francisco; and his mother, Elizabeth, of
Chicago.</TE>

<HD>Bernard S. Jefferson, 91; Respected Appellate Judge and
Legal Scholar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bernard S. Jefferson, a retired California appellate justice who was
renowned as a legal scholar, educator and master of the law of
evidence whose book on the subject is used by judges throughout the
state, has died. He was 91.</LD>
<LD>   A Baldwin Hills resident who was one of the first African
Americans appointed to the state appellate courts, Jefferson died of
pneumonia Saturday in a Los Angeles convalescent hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Jefferson was appointed associate justice of Division 4 of the 2nd
District Court of Appeal in 1975 to succeed his retiring brother,
Justice Edwin L. Jefferson. He retired as presiding justice of
Division 1 in 1980.</LD>
<TE>   He had served a year on the Los Angeles Municipal Court and 15
years on the Los Angeles Superior Court, where his rulings included a
landmark decision scrapping the state's system of financing schools
through local property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson ruled that the state's method of school financing was
unconstitutional because more money went to districts with high
property values. The California Supreme Court upheld his ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "He is regarded by everyone who knows him or knows of him as one
of the great people in law. He was a giant," said appellate Justice
Norman Epstein.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson was one of the founders of the California Judges
College, a two-week program for new judges held each year at UC
Berkeley. It is considered the premier judicial education program in
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the evidence course he taught in the program, Jefferson
wrote the "California Evidence Benchbook," a 957-page treatise
published in 1972. A 1,900-page, two-volume second edition was
published in 1982 and has been updated since then.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the best command of the law of evidence of any judge that
I've known," Epstein said. "He was a master at it."After retiring
from the Court of Appeal at age 70--a decision he made because of a
law that reduced justices' benefits if they remained on the bench
past that age--Jefferson returned to his lifelong love of teaching.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, he became president of the University of West Los Angeles
Schools of Law and Paralegal Studies in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   During his 12-year tenure as president, which included teaching
courses in evidence and criminal procedure, Jefferson was
instrumental in expanding the school's curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   "He came in at a critical time to provide the university with the
benefit of his reputation and stature in the legal education
community," said Robert W. Brown, the university's current president.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said Jefferson served as mentor to countless students.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always ready to help someone else and to engage in an
understanding of the theory of the law," Brown said. "And he could do
it in a manner that could make it understandable to a common person.
He was a master teacher."</TE>
<TE>   The youngest of four children, Bernard Samuel Jefferson was born
June 29, 1910, in Coffeeville, Miss. His father was a carpenter, his
mother a seamstress.</TE>
<TE>   Living in a mainly white farming community where African American
children were barred from attending school, the Jeffersons
home-schooled their children. To improve their children's educational
opportunities, they moved first to Denver and then to Los Angeles,
where Jefferson excelled academically.</TE>
<TE>   A Gifted Orator in High School</TE>
<TE>   At Manual Arts High School, he was a gifted orator and debater,
and he graduated in 1927 as class valedictorian.</TE>
<TE>   He was elected Phi Beta Kappa at UCLA, where he studied political
science and graduated summa cum laude in 1931.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson received a scholarship to Harvard University Law School,
where he received his law degree, cum laude, in 1934.</TE>
<TE>   From 1935 to 1941, he served as a professor of law at Howard
University School of Law in Washington, D.C. He returned to Harvard
in 1941 to pursue graduate studies leading to his doctoral of
juridical science in the field of evidence in 1943.</TE>
<TE>   After serving as assistant general counsel in the Office of Price
Administration in Washington from 1942 to 1946, he returned to Los
Angeles and worked in private practice until his appointment in 1959
as a judge of the Municipal Court by Gov. Edmund G. Brown Sr.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a man of enormous warmth and generosity," Epstein said.
"He dedicated a major portion of the royalties from his evidence book
to judicial education.</TE>
<TE>   "People tend to just love the man."</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson also devoted much of his life to the community.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to serving on the board of directors of the Los
Angeles Urban League and serving as its president for six years, he
served as a trustee of the First A.M.E. Church of Los Angeles, and
was on the board of managers of the Wilshire branch of the YMCA.</TE>
<TE>   He also was district commissioner of the Boy Scouts of America,
was on the regional board of directors of the National Council of
Christians and Jews, and was a member of the Minority Employment
Advisory Committee of the Department of Employment, in addition to
serving with many other organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson's first wife, Devonia, died in 1946. He is survived by
his wife of 43 years, Betty; his children, Cassandra Powell of Los
Angeles and Dr. Roland S. Jefferson of Los Angeles; four
grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral service will be at 4 p.m. Saturday at Angelus Funeral
Home, 3875 S. Crenshaw Blvd., Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Bernard S.
Jefferson Law Library, University of West Los Angeles School of Law,
1155 W. Arbor Vitae St., Inglewood, CA 90301-2902.</TE>

<HD>Fred Okrand, 84; Fought Key ACLU Battles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fred Okrand, former longtime legal director of the ACLU of Southern
California who represented Japanese Americans imprisoned in World War
II relocation camps and for many years helped lead a courtroom battle
to integrate Los Angeles city schools through busing, died Monday at
Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Woodland Hills. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Okrand, who suffered from cancer and had a stroke during the past
year, died of natural causes, according to his son, Dean.</LD>
<LD>   Okrand was the ACLU's first legal director. During his six-decade
association with the civil liberties group, he argued at least four
cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and took several others before
the California Supreme Court.</LD>
<TE>   "He was the force behind some of the most significant
constitutional challenges in our nation," said ACLU Executive
Director Ramona Ripston.</TE>
<TE>   Okrand defended Jehovah's Witnesses' right to hand out religious
pamphlets, teachers who refused to sign loyalty oaths during the
McCarthy era, and freedom of speech for Communists and Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   He also successfully argued that law enforcement officers have no
right to spy on the lawful activities of citizens, a case that laid
the foundation for a spying lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police
Department that was settled in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   His most enduring battle was one he helped wage for people of
Japanese ancestry whose rights were violated by the U.S. government
during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Until just before his death, he was working on a case involving
another dark but little-known chapter of history--the internment by
the United States of Japanese Latin Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Okrand was the son of a Boyle Heights gas station owner and was
born and raised in East Los Angeles. He attended Roosevelt High
School, where he was head yell leader and a top scholar. He graduated
at 15 and entered UCLA, where he earned a bachelor's degree.</TE>
<TE>   He married his high school sweetheart, Mimi Margolin, the day
before he graduated from USC's law school in 1940. She survives him,
along with Dean, another son, Marc, and two grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Okrand joined the law firm of Gallagher &amp; Wirin but left after the
United States entered World War II and sent 120,000 Americans of
Japanese descent on the West Coast into isolated relocation camps.</TE>
<TE>   The law firm represented a number of labor unions that favored the
internment, but Okrand opposed it, calling it "discrimination purely
based on race."</TE>
<TE>   He and Al Wirin, one of the firm's partners, left to work for the
ACLU, which Okrand had heard about from a leaflet someone had left on
a bus seat.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1942, he, Wirin and a third lawyer, E.W. Camp, filed
habeas corpus petitions in federal court challenging the
constitutionality of the internments on behalf of two Japanese
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   He received threatening letters for championing the Japanese
Americans' cause, but ''he ignored them,'' his wife said. ''He just
felt it was such an injustice.''</TE>
<TE>   Because of sharp divisions within the Japanese American community
about how to proceed, the plaintiffs withdrew from the case before it
could be argued.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU and the American Friends Service Committee were the only
two organizations that formally protested the internments, which were
popular at the time. Even some ACLU members did not oppose the
detention camps, Okrand recalled in a 1995 article in The Times.</TE>
<TE>   During the war, Okrand spent four years in the Army, serving in
the European theater. When he returned, he and Wirin successfully
represented Japanese Americans who sought to regain their citizenship
after renouncing it because of oppressive conditions in one of the
camps. The court ruled that their renunciations had been coerced and
therefore were invalid.</TE>
<TE>   Because he charged nothing for his work for the ACLU, Okrand
supported his family by taking on unsympathetic clients. He and Wirin
handled civil liberties cases for such reputed gangsters as Frank
Carbo, Mickey Cohen and Louis Dragna.</TE>
<TE>   He finally assumed a paid position with the ACLU in 1972 as its
first legal director.</TE>
<TE>   From the 1960s through the early '80s, his most consuming case
involved the fight over school busing.</TE>
<TE>   Okrand lived in the San Fernando Valley, where most schools
offered conditions superior to those in inner-city areas: They were
air-conditioned, had experienced teachers and classroom seats to
spare. In other parts of the sprawling Los Angeles school district,
classrooms were dilapidated, overcrowded and staffed by undertrained
teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Okrand was among those who believed mandatory busing was the
solution to the inequity.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, the ACLU joined forces with the NAACP to file a complaint
on behalf of the parents of Mary Ellen Crawford and other black and
Latino students, alleging that the district had intentionally caused
the segregation of its schools.</TE>
<TE>   The case led to three combative years of court-ordered busing that
ended in 1981 after a state initiative passed that barred state
courts from ordering busing as a remedy for segregation.</TE>
<TE>   The legal wrangling continued until 1989, when the NAACP said it
could no longer afford to press the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand and sympathize with those kids and parents who don't
want to get on the bus," Okrand said in 1984. "I understand, but I
think it's wrong. The civil liberties issue here is the right to an
equal education. And there comes a time when the school board has to
say these kids aren't getting an education and they have to go to
this other school, even if it means a bus ride."</TE>
<TE>   He called the busing case his "greatest judicial disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   Okrand retired in 1984, but he continued to work on cases as the
ACLU's emeritus legal director.</TE>
<TE>   His last case was a class-action lawsuit filed in 1996 on behalf
of 2,264 Japanese Latin Americans who were abducted from their homes
and sent to internment camps in the United States. The lawsuit
alleged that they were to be used in civilian prisoner exchanges with
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The Latin American Japanese sought redress from the U.S.
government and a formal apology under the 1988 reparations law, but
their applications were denied because they were not U.S. citizens
and legal residents at the time of their detention.</TE>
<TE>   The case was settled in 1998 when the government agreed to send
each survivor or their heirs a letter of apology from then-President
Clinton, as well as $5,000 each in reparation.</TE>
<TE>   As co-counsel, Okrand conducted research for the legal brief,
attended court hearings and generally provided the much younger lead
attorney with historical perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought so much experience and passion to the case," said Los
Angeles attorney Robin Toma, who, unlike Okrand, had not lived
through the World War II years. "I felt like I had this anchor in
history and this moral and legal authority that gave me confidence in
confronting the injustice of our government then and now. I will miss
him deeply," Toma said.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be announced later. Donations in Okrand's
memory may be sent to the ACLU Foundation of Southern California,
1616 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90026.</TE>

<HD>Fix Sought for Property Bill</HD>
<DH>Assembly: Current version contains a loophole allowing
firms to dodge fines for mishandling unclaimed assets of
Californians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State lawmakers are scrambling to fix an "amnesty" bill that's on a
fast-track through the Assembly, in hopes of plugging a loophole that
could let some companies that have been caught violating the state's
unclaimed-property laws avoid millions of dollars in fines.</LD>
<LD>   The bill is being touted as a revenue-raising move that will bring
roughly $35 million to the cash-strapped state treasury by collecting
forgotten refunds, bank deposits and other assets long abandoned by
customers of banks and other companies. State law requires these
assets to be turned over to the state for safekeeping if they are
unclaimed for at least three years.</LD>
<LD>   But officials at the state attorney general's office realized late
last week--after the bill had passed the state Senate--that wording
in the bill could let companies be absolved of penalties by joining
the amnesty program, even if these companies already were being
investigated for violating unclaimed property laws.</LD>
<TE>   "The intent is not to give companies that we are investigating a
free ride," said Hallye Jordan, spokeswoman for the state attorney
general. "We will be offering amendments to ensure that the bill's
intent is upheld."</TE>
<TE>   Burbank real estate executive Bill Bowen, who is battling the
banking industry in court over the issue of unclaimed customer
accounts, contends the amnesty bill could become a
multimillion-dollar giveaway to banks doing business in California if
it's not amended. Bowen's 1999 state court lawsuit alleges that banks
owe the state millions in interest and penalties stemming from
unclaimed property that hasn't been turned over to the state in
accordance with the law.</TE>
<TE>   "This is [supposed to be] an amnesty, not a 'get out of jail free'
card," said Bowen, who operates HomeownersRights.com.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was needed because the state's previous unclaimed
property amnesty program expired at the end of last year, state
officials said. Under that program, companies that hadn't turned over
unclaimed property in a timely manner--a practice known as
"escheating"--could voluntarily surrender the property without being
hit with interest or penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies were unable to participate in last year's program
because they were affected by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, or
because they learned about the program too late in the year,
according to the Department of Finance. Companies discovered to be
holding unclaimed property in violation of state law can be assessed
interest of 12% a year on the value of the assets, as well as other
penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "It would not be equitable for the state to charge these
businesses an interest penalty for property that otherwise would have
been remitted under the amnesty program," the Department of Finance
wrote in support of the pending amnesty bill.</TE>
<TE>   If the amnesty bill is passed, state officials expect roughly
$35million to $40 million in property to be turned over to the state.
This property includes abandoned bank accounts, contents of safety
deposit boxes, as well as unclaimed tenant deposits, bill
overpayments and refunds.</TE>
<TE>   While abandoned property is owned by the people who lost it and
not the state, the state is able to use the money until it is claimed
by the rightful owners, said Richard Chivaro, general counsel for the
state controller's office.</TE>
<TE>   Under the amnesty bill passed by the Senate last week, companies
could participate in the amnesty program as long as they weren't
subject of an investigation by the state attorney general's office
for violating unclaimed property laws or are facing a pending audit
or litigation involving the controller's office as of Jan. 1, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Critics such as Bowen worry that the law could provide unintended
protection for companies that were investigated prior to the trigger
date in the law. That would include the banks he's suing,
jeopardizing a potential windfall for the state.</TE>
<TE>   If his lawsuit is successful, Bowen contends, banks could be
required to pay $600 million in interest and penalties to the state.
But the state wouldn't be able to collect, Bowen says, unless the
amnesty bill now pending in Sacramento is changed.</TE>
<TE>   Several banks contacted declined to comment on the amnesty bill or
Bowen's lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are now trying to amend the amnesty bill so companies
won't be able to escape fines and penalties if they are later found
to have violated the state's unclaimed property laws.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure that businesses suspected or convicted of
wrongdoing cannot participate in the amnesty program, which is really
a gesture of goodwill by the state," said Chris Tapio, legislative
director for Assemblyman John Dutra (D-Fremont), who is sponsoring
the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "That is what we meant to say all along. Some might argue that the
bill already does. But this is to make it crystal clear."</TE>

<HD>Bristol-Myers Drug a Letdown in Trials</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Researchers on Wednesday unveiled disappointing results for a
make-or-break Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. drug, sending its shares
plunging to a four-year low and leading analysts to suggest the drug
giant could become a takeover target.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based Bristol-Myers hoped the drug, designed to treat
congestive heart failure and high blood pressure, would become its
next blockbuster.</LD>
<LD>   But data from the heart-failure trial showed the drug, Vanlev, was
not superior to an inexpensive generic already on the market, and
results of the hypertension trial failed to alleviate safety concerns
that had hobbled the drug's progress in an earlier trial.</LD>
<TE>   "Vanlev represented the most important opportunity for
Bristol-Myers to grow at or above a competitive pace," said Richard
Evans, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. "There are only two things
now that will make Bristol-Myers grow: One is a major new product,
which we don't have, and two is a merger."</TE>
<TE>   Without Vanlev, which analysts had predicted could generate peak
sales of $3 billion, Bristol-Myers is left with a handful of less
lucrative drugs that won't reach the market until at least 2004.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Bristol-Myers' sales and earnings are slowing: It
expects earnings to drop by 10% to 15% in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers' shares fell 15.6% to $41.08 on the New York Stock
Exchange, wiping out more than $14 billion in market capitalization.
The blow is the latest in a series of reversals for the firm, still
reeling from a setback to cancer drug Erbitux, which it is developing
with ImClone Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Vanlev's disappointing results puts additional pressure on
Bristol-Myers' chief executive, Peter Dolan, who has been accused of
paying too much for Erbitux rights and overpaying in the $7.8-billion
purchase of DuPont's drug unit.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bristol-Myers does not plan to give up on Vanlev, for which
it sought U.S. regulatory approval to treat hypertension in December.</TE>
<TE>   Though researchers said results of the heart-failure trial showed
the drug only to be as effective as the generic, they said it may
reduce future heart attacks or stroke in heart-failure patients by
10% to 20%. They said Bristol-Myers plans to launch new trials to
prove it.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the company withdrew Vanlev's application to the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration after the agency expressed concern about
angioedema. The latest study tested 25,000 hypertension patients in
one of the biggest clinical trials ever.</TE>
<TE>   Vanlev proved more effective than the generic drug enalapril in
treating high blood pressure, the researchers said. The higher
incidence in Vanlev-treated patients of a side-effect known as
angioedema, a potentially life-threatening reaction that causes
swelling of the face, neck, lips and throat, was minor in comparison
to the drug's potential to save lives, they said.</TE>

<HD>Diedrich Coffee Chief Steps Down</HD>

<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J. Michael Jenkins, who helped shore up Diedrich Coffee Inc.'s
sagging bottom line, has resigned as chief executive to concentrate
on his treatment for gastric cancer, the Irvine company said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jenkins, who publicly announced his illness in August, will serve
as an advisor to the company. Philip G. Hirsch, who recently served
as president of CUE Digital Radio Corp. after a 16-year career at
PricewaterhouseCoopers, has been named interim CEO.</LD>
<LD>   In his 18 months at Diedrich, Jenkins put the brakes on a costly
expansion plan, cut labor and other costs, and helped boost the
company's more-lucrative wholesale coffee business.</LD>
<TE>   Hirsch said he plans to serve three to four months in the
position, expanding the wholesale operations as well as adding new
franchise coffeehouses.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarter ended Dec. 12, Diedrich earned $1.3 million, or 26
cents a share, versus $164,000, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue declined by nearly 18% to $16 million, reflecting the closure
of under-performing stores. Sales at stores open more than a year, a
key industry barometer, were off 5.2%, however.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins' resignation was announced after regular U.S. trading
hours.</TE>
<TE>   The stock fell 3 cents to close at $3.50 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Univision's New Network Revises Its Programming</HD>
<DH>TV: A ratings slide prompts TeleFutura to add telenovela,
departing from earlier strategy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a steep slide in February ratings, Spanish-language TV
broadcasting giant Univision Communications Inc. is revamping its
programming schedule just two months after launching its second
broadcast network, TeleFutura.</LD>
<LD>   Univision introduced TeleFutura on Jan. 14 with the idea of
offering viewers different programs without directly competing with
those found on the Univision flagship network. So TeleFutura has been
using a mix of sports, Hollywood movies and music videos to attract
younger bilingual viewers who traditionally watch English-language
television, and until this week its prime-time schedule was filled
with dubbed Hollywood movies.</LD>
<LD>   But after losing nearly a third of its original audience in
February, TeleFutura this week added an entertainment variety show
and a soap opera, or telenovela, to its prime-time lineup. The move
signals a dramatic departure from Univision's earlier strategy to
avoid broadcasting soap operas at night on TeleFutura out of fear
that it might steal viewers from the Univision network, which is
stocked with evening novelas.</LD>
<TE>   David Joyce, a broadcast analyst with Guzman &amp; Co., downgraded
Univision's stock to "neutral" Wednesday because TeleFutura
programming changes represent "a reversion to the historical
Spanish-language network programming.... It could create more
cannibalization of the main Univision network audience."</TE>
<TE>   Joyce also noted that Univision's network President Ray Rodriguez
this week sold 150,000 shares when the stock was trading at more than
$46 a share, which contributed to the analyst's decision to
downgrade.</TE>
<TE>   Univision shares closed at $43.97 on Wednesday, down 53 cents, on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez declined to comment on his stock sale. Instead, he
downplayed the TeleFutura changes.</TE>
<TE>   Although TeleFutura ratings "dipped" during the February sweeps
period, Rodriguez said that the ratings had improved during the last
two weeks and that TeleFutura had boosted Univision's overall market
share in Spanish-language broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   "We have hit a home run with TeleFutura, and the network has only
been on the air two months," Rodriguez said. "None of these changes
are a retreat from our strategy; they're just programming changes."</TE>
<TE>   The 10 p.m. soap opera on TeleFutura will not compete with novelas
on the Univision network because there are none in that time slot,
Rodriguez said. He said TeleFutura's prime-time "El Inutil" (The
Useless) will compete only against  rival network Telemundo.</TE>
<TE>   "We told people that we would take some audience away from
Telemundo, and we've done that. But most important, we've taken
audience away from the English-language networks," Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   "TeleFutura is 6% of Univision's revenues," said David W. Miller,
a senior media analyst with Sanders Morris Harris in Los Angeles.
"It's not a huge network. We see this as more of a dent in the
quarterly earnings, not a long-term problem."</TE>

<HD>Enron Investor Lawsuits May Add Defendants</HD>
<DH>Courts: Auditor Andersen's indictment prompts attorneys to
consider other sources of settlement money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys suing accounting firm Andersen on behalf of Enron Corp.
investors are starting to identify additional targets after
concluding that the fading company will be unable to generate enough
revenue in coming years to help fund a settlement.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen is bleeding clients and is in talks to transfer its
overseas operations to rival KPMG, making it likely that its only
sources of settlement money are what is believed to be a $250-million
insurance policy, its cash on hand and possibly an assessment on its
partners, the attorneys said.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the attorneys are exploring how to widen both
class-action and pension plan lawsuits against Andersen for its work
for Enron, which filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2.</LD>
<TE>   Potential targets include the Houston-based energy trader's legal
advisors, bankers and other business partners. The attorneys plan to
file a consolidated complaint in Houston federal court April 1 in
which they might add new defendants to the case.</TE>
<TE>   With Enron in Chapter 11, Andersen has been seen as the deepest
pocket to settle claims by investors and employees who lost billions
of dollars in Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   But attorneys changed their view over the last week, after the
federal government unsealed an indictment of Andersen on an
obstruction of justice charge for destroying Enron documents sought
in the federal probe of the Enron meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen became the target of the federal investigation after
certifying Enron audits that hid losses and debt from investors.
Andersen pleaded innocent to the charge in a Houston federal court
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has lost about 50 clients since December, however, and on
Wednesday, BB&amp;T Corp. of Winston-Salem, N.C., Andersen's largest
banking client, and BMC Software Inc. of Houston each picked new
auditors.</TE>
<TE>   "It is total chaos," said Vincent Cappucci, who represents Florida
pension funds in the class-action shareholders lawsuit against
Andersen and Enron's senior executives. "There is no question that
the indictment severely impaired Andersen's ability to pay a
settlement at the levels floated just a month ago.''</TE>
<TE>   Andersen previously discussed paying $750 million over a five-year
period to settle its Enron liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that the indictment trumped all other issues
and made it extremely difficult for any progress to be made on other
discussions and claims," said Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton.</TE>
<TE>   Before the indictment was unsealed, Andersen was close to a
settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which it
would have paid $350 million to $500 million into a compensation fund
and agree to a series of operational reforms, according to a source
familiar with the talks. The two sides were dickering over the size
of the payment--both believing they would reach an
accommodation--when the Justice Department stepped in with its
indictment, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   People familiar with Andersen settlement efforts said the firm has
yet to make a formal offer to attorneys for the University of
California Board of Regents, which is acting as the lead plaintiff in
the class-action lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the university system, which lost about $145
million in pension and endowment funds in the Enron collapse, also
said that the indictment will hurt its recovery efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the legal and business difficulties that Andersen
reportedly has, any future settlement offers will probably reflect
those problems. Stories about Andersen settlement offers at this
juncture and in this climate are premature," said Trey Davis,
spokesman for the Regents.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is doubtful Andersen can survive over the long term,
Houston attorney Charlie Parker, who represents New York City pension
funds in the Enron litigation, said there are still ways to structure
deals that will benefit investors and other claimants.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still some value to Andersen's book of business or else
you would not see these other firms trying to figure out it they can
acquire some of that business," Parker said.</TE>
<TE>   Although talks to merge Andersen with rivals such as Deloitte
Touche Tohmatsu or Ernst &amp; Young have broken off because of the Enron
liability issues, BDO Seidman, the nation's sixth-largest accounting
firm, said Wednesday it is still exploring ways to acquire portions
of Andersen's domestic business. A person familiar with those
discussions said BDO could try to use an Andersen bankruptcy filing
to protect itself from also acquiring Enron-related claims.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, however, outlined a plan where other firms could bid on
that business, paying into a settlement pool in return for
court-approved liability releases.</TE>
<TE>   "This must be part of a court-ordered approval of a settlement and
all the major parties would have to agree to it," Parker said.
"Otherwise, I can't imagine any entity merging or acquiring a part of
Andersen without assurance that it won't face years of litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Andersen continued to rally support from the 84 member
firms that make up the Andersen Worldwide confederation for a deal
that would transfer the overseas network to the KPMG accounting firm.
The deal may be challenged, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Any transaction or business combination that seeks to shield
Andersen or its successor company from its liability in this case is
unacceptable. Andersen or any new restructured, corporate entity
should not be allowed to insulate itself from the consequences of
this fraud or put its assets beyond the reach of the victims," Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   But other attorneys expect the KPMG deal to move forward.</TE>
<TE>   "There's really not a heck of a lot we can do judicially to stop
them from doing what they're doing abroad," said Michael Engelhart, a
Houston attorney representing Enron investors and former employees
suing Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   If it generates cash from the sale of international affiliates,
Engelhart said, Andersen may still position itself to pay off
plaintiffs. He downplayed suggestions that the federal indictment
would diminish chances for a recovery. "The burden of proof for the
government is too high. They will work out a deal that lets Andersen
escape and makes the government look good. Five years from now,
Andersen will be a going concern."</TE>

<HD>Compaq Shareholders OK Merger With HP</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Compaq Computer Corp. shareholders on Wednesday approved the
company's proposed $20-billion merger with Hewlett-Packard Co. in a
vote as routine and decisive as HP's was not.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast to the conflict-ridden HP shareholder vote Tuesday
that left the outcome of the merger in doubt, Compaq shareholders
ratified by a 9-to-1 margin what would be the largest merger in
computer history.</LD>
<LD>   Retired chemical engineer John Pickering was typical of Compaq
shareholders who attended the company's 45-minute meeting in a
Houston hotel ballroom.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel that the two companies are in a struggling situation,"
said Pickering, who holds 600 Compaq shares. "But the two together
will be able to challenge any other leader in the industry. IBM is
the obvious one."</TE>
<TE>   The deal was vigorously contested by HP director Walter Hewlett,
who argued that a merger with Compaq would stick HP in the
money-losing market for personal computers and siphon earnings from
the company's profitable printer business.</TE>
<TE>   Although results from both shareholder votes are not likely to be
official for weeks, Compaq Chief Executive Michael Capellas on
Wednesday said he was confident that the final tally of HP votes will
favor the merger. Hewlett has said the vote was "too close to call."</TE>
<TE>   "They would not have announced it without due care," Capellas said
of HP CEO Carly Fiorina's claim of victory.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies in September announced their plans to merge on
the premise that a combined company would be better able to compete
in an industry racked by recession and unprecedented cutbacks in
technology spending.</TE>
<TE>   A merger, the companies argued, would let them slash $2.5billion
in annual costs, combine their product lines to offer soup-to-nuts
technology for large global companies, and compete more effectively
with rivals IBM Corp., Dell Computer Corp., and Sun Microsystems Inc.</TE>

<HD>EMI to Cut 1,800 Jobs, Drop 400 Musical Acts</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The move will save about $140 million
annually, firm says. About 500 layoffs will be in L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EMI Group announced a massive overhaul Wednesday, slashing 1,800 jobs
and dropping 400 acts in a drive to cut costs and stem losses at the
struggling British music giant--home to such stars as Garth Brooks,
Norah Jones, Janet Jackson and the Beatles. Nearly one-third of the
layoffs will be in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The dramatic restructuring, in which about 20% of EMI's work force
will be cut, is expected to deliver annual cost savings of about $140
million, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   The move follows two profit warnings and comes ahead of the
release next week of EMI's 2001 earnings report in which the company
is expected to post an estimated $214 million in pretax profit--down
from $372 million a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   Alain Levy, chief executive of EMI's record division who was
brought in last year to revive the world's third-largest music
company, said the cuts were necessary as sales continued to plummet.
He warned that the industry must change its glitzy ways.</TE>
<TE>   "The old industry system is doomed. It got too fat," Levy said in
an interview from London. "Music companies have got to change the way
they do business. This is not about guaranteed executive bonuses or
first-class plane flights anymore. Nor should the focus simply be
about market share or quarterly reports. It's about long-term artist
development. It's about profits."</TE>
<TE>   Levy said about 500 of the 1,800 pink slips would be issued to
U.S. employees at the Virgin and Capitol labels, as well as its EMD
distribution operation, all of which are based in L.A. And although
the bulk of the staff cuts will affect back-office positions, the
layoffs also will include more than 20 managing directors at
satellite offices around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the worldwide downturn in music sales and rampant piracy,
David Mumms, head of EMI's North American operations, acknowledged
that some problems dogging the British corporation were
"EMI-specific."</TE>
<TE>   "We discovered a number of efficiencies that we had room to make
without doing any real damage to the process of making and selling
records," Mumms said.</TE>
<TE>   Levy said a large part of the restructuring would focus on better
management of Virgin Records, which EMI acquired in 1991 and, he
maintained, was never fully integrated into the company's global
empire. In many countries, Levy said, EMI operated separate offices
for Virgin and Capitol, with duplicate accounting, marketing and
promotion staffs.</TE>
<TE>   Levy said that no other EMI superstars were expected to meet the
fate of Mariah Carey, who was pushed out after only one disappointing
CD. In January, EMI agreed to pay the pop diva an estimated $33
million to buy out her contract, in addition to $20 million Carey had
earned for one album.</TE>
<TE>   Levy said the company expected to save millions in recording and
marketing costs by elbowing out hundreds of unknown acts in such
markets as Finland, Indonesia, Chile and Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   The massive restructuring plan is expected to result in a one-time
charge of about $340 million. Levy said EMI also intended to
refinance its debts and cut its annual dividend in half to help pay
for the restructuring.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's announcement is the latest in a string of shake-ups at
EMI. In November, EMI Group Chairman Eric Nicoli fired EMI record
chief Ken Berry and replaced him with Levy. Levy then fired Virgin
head Nancy Berry, the wife of Ken Berry, as well as a number of
executives, including Chief Financial Officer Tony Bates.</TE>
<TE>   Levy also ousted Virgin executives Ray Cooper and Ashley Newton,
barely a week after dumping Carey.</TE>
<TE>   Nicoli said he was confident that Levy's restructuring plan would
help resuscitate his beleaguered company.</TE>
<TE>   "It you want to make a comparison between the new management team
with the previous regime, I would say that these guys have a much
harder commercial edge," Nicoli said. "They also have vision and
leadership--qualities that the business badly needs in the foul
weather that we find ourselves in."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of EMI rose 2.9% in London trading Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Travel Trend Lifts Van Nuys Firm</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A pair of Southern California entrepreneurs had a good idea 22 years
ago when they founded Air Group Inc., a Van Nuys firm that manages
corporate jets and charters some of the planes when their owners
aren't using them.</LD>
<LD>   Air Group's founders and majority owners--Jon Winthrop, 47,
chairman and chief executive, and Bob Christy, 72, now a company
director who retired last year from daily operations--are seeing
their brainchild expand in a booming industry.</LD>
<LD>   But the story of that boom and their firm is not a simple one. It
speaks volumes about changing patterns in air travel and about the
pressures and pains faced by small firms in a marketplace that favors
companies larger and stronger in capital.</LD>
<TE>   Air charter traffic is surging as company managers and wealthy
individuals--those who typically fly first class--are seeking
alternatives to commercial air travel, in which delays are frequent
because of added security precautions in the aftermath of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Business travelers have been complaining for some time about high
fares and deteriorating service from commercial airlines. With the
increase in delays and cancellations since Sept. 11, more
corporations and managers are looking at jet ownership or charter
services.</TE>
<TE>   Air Group is benefiting from the trend. The firm's revenue this
year is expected to grow 26% to $82million, with about $6million in
net profit, Winthrop says. The company, which has 164 employees,
including 118 pilots, will increase its staff as it adds 10 jets,
bringing its total to 50 jets under management.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Winthrop and Christy may have little time to enjoy their
triumph, because Air Group is only a small bird in a very big sky.</TE>
<TE>   A giant is emerging in the field of corporate jet management, air
chartering and fractional ownership--in which time shares are sold on
corporate jet aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns Executive Jet, a
Woodbridge, N.J.-based firm that developed NetJets, an innovative
operation that buys corporate jets and sells shares in them,
promising time-share owners custom jet service on one hour's notice
with any of its 350 planes.</TE>
<TE>   NetJets is adding more than 100 jets a year, aiming to control a
fleet of 1,000, which would be virtually a global airline of
9-to-18-seat planes.</TE>
<TE>   Time sharing at rates of about $4,500 to $10,000 an hour,
depending on size and range of jet, appeals to those in specialized
occupations--such as golfer Nancy Lopez or baseball's Jason Giambi
and basketball's Reggie Miller--who are customers of Marquis Jet
Partners, a reseller of NetJets time shares.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Executive Jet, in another of its operations, is in the
same business as Air Group--providing pilots, crew and maintenance of
a company plane for an annual service fee. The management company
normally puts the jets out on charter, earning some of the costs back
for the owners.</TE>
<TE>   Executive Jet already is bigger than Air Group, with 80 jets under
management and "going up to 125 or 130 jets this year," says company
spokesman Kevin Russell.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 10 sizable jet management, charter and
fractional-ownership firms operating in the U.S. market, Winthrop
says, and he thinks Executive Jet may acquire one of two Europe-based
chartering companies--TAG Aviation or Jet Aviation--to swell its
capacity faster. (Spokesman Russell denies merger rumors.)</TE>
<TE>   But clearly, Berkshire Hathaway, which has cash-generating
insurance operations and $36 billion in annual revenue, has the
capital strength to dominate a new industry. At present it is laying
out at least $3 billion a year to finance the purchase of more than
100 corporate jets. By contrast, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines
announced last year that it would invest $80 million to launch a
corporate jet division, but now has backed away, saying it would not
commit more capital to the venture.</TE>
<TE>   Where does all that leave Air Group? Taking the small firm's
route.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a boutique firm; we can offer superior service," says
Winthrop, a business graduate of USC who worked as a salesman for IBM
Corp. before getting into aviation. The firm prides itself on running
like the Marine Corps, because Christy-- a former Marine lieutenant
colonel, developed its operations.</TE>
<TE>   Managing company planes for such clients as Calabasas-based
Countrywide Credit Industries and Beverly Hills' International Lease
Finance Corp., a division of American International Group, gives Air
Group about 40% of its revenue in fees.</TE>
<TE>   And it also gives it custody of the jets to charter. Air Group
grew rapidly in the 1990s by chartering jets to such clients as
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. and UBS Warburg so their
investment bankers could fly to three cities a day promoting new
stock issues to local investment firms.</TE>
<TE>   That business evaporated with the stock market bust of 2001. But
chartering is coming back as companies find that their managers and
salespeople no longer can get around to two and three cities a day on
airlines. Corporate jets fly out of smaller airports, such as Van
Nuys and Teterboro, N.J., in the New York area, and so can operate
with more flexibility. In addition, they can fly to smaller cities
that now have only limited service from commercial airlines.</TE>
<TE>   As small firms must, Air Group keeps its rates low: $2,500 an hour
to charter a Cessna Citation, with a 3,000-mile range, to $7,500 an
hour for a Gulfstream V, with a 7,000-mile range. That's 12% to 33%
less than Executive Jet's charges. And chartering works out cheaper
than fractional ownership, Winthrop explains, because time-share
owners must bear part of the capital cost of the airplane.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, keeping rates lower means that Air Group cannot earn
the return on capital that a Buffett enterprise demands.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Winthrop says, Air Group can prosper as a quality service
firm with a niche in an expanding industry. He says Air Group will
try to go public if revenue rises to $110 million and the market is
receptive. Or it could be acquired by a larger firm.</TE>
<TE>   One way or another, Air Group is at a turning point. It has
remained a partnership since Winthrop and Christy drew up plans on a
restaurant napkin in 1980. But they no longer are sole owners.</TE>
<TE>   "We give stock options to employees who are 10 years with the
firm," Winthrop explains, "so they can benefit if we go public or are
acquired by another company."</TE>
<TE>   For a 22-year-old entrepreneurial business to have as many
possibilities as Air Group has today shows the power of a good
idea--and a lot of hard work.</TE>

<HD>Rating Firms Say Enron Misled Them</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Members of Senate panel criticize companies for
not questioning more closely the energy giant's finances and for
failing to downgrade it earlier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Officials of Wall Street credit-rating companies told Congress on
Wednesday that Enron executives misled them about partnerships used
to conceal massive debt. Senators criticized the firms for not more
closely questioning Enron's finances.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the officials said Enron's former chairman, Kenneth L. Lay,
called them when the energy trading company was seeking a higher
credit rating.</LD>
<LD>   One reported calls to his agency from former Clinton
administration Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, a top executive of
Citigroup, one of the banks that lent hundreds of millions of dollars
to Enron, and from Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   Nothing came of the calls, said John Diaz, a managing director of
Moody's Investors Service, during testimony before the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Leah Johnson, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, said later that
investment bankers at Citigroup might have tried to include Rubin in
a call to Moody's, but he was never connected.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers and regulators are examining why the big credit-rating
companies, such as Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Ratings,
maintained high ratings for Enron until a few days before its
bankruptcy filing Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "We now know that material information was missing" and that Enron
failed to disclose the existence of three of the partnerships, Diaz
testified. Furthermore, he said, "Much of the information that was
provided was inaccurate."</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission also is examining the role
of the credit-rating firms as it pursues a civil investigation of
Enron and its former auditor, the Andersen accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   At a separate hearing before the House Financial Services
Committee, SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt urged lawmakers to delay
passing any bill that would bar auditors from offering consulting
services to clients.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, in detailing his views for the first time, staked out a
position at odds with Republican and Democratic lawmakers as well as
business and accounting leaders, who favor some new constraints on
consulting by accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, a Republican who represented the accounting industry as a
lawyer in private practice, called for Congress to wait until an SEC
conflict-of-interest rule adopted in November 2000 is phased in
before considering new consulting restrictions on auditors.</TE>
<TE>   "The SEC, 18 months ago under my predecessor, adopted a series of
rules to define what could be done and what could not be done," Pitt
told the committee. "I believe that those rules should be given a
fair chance to see if they solve the problem or not."</TE>
<TE>   House Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael G. Oxley, an
Ohio Republican, has proposed barring auditors from doing technology
and internal-audit consulting for clients.</TE>
<TE>   Bills sponsored by Democrats would stop all or nearly all
consulting services.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press and Bloomberg News were used in compiling this
report.</TE>

<HD>HP-Compaq Integration Aims to Find a New Way</HD>
<DH>Merger: Companies have been working for months on how to
combine two distinct corporate cultures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN and ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>For Hewlett-Packard Co., the real work is just beginning.</LD>
<LD>   After claiming victory Tuesday in a hard-fought proxy battle, HP
apparently has the go-ahead to acquire Compaq Computer Corp., though
official results won't be in for weeks.</LD>
<LD>   What sold many of the large institutional shareholders, which
sided with HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina against dissident
director Walter Hewlett, was the unprecedented effort HP and Compaq
put into planning exactly how the two firms would mesh.</LD>
<TE>   But the integration plotting that has occurred--more than 500,000
hours of work laying out everything from who will staff the top
several layers of management in every division to what will happen
every 15 minutes on day one of the deal's legal closing--pales before
the enormous task ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "All I've seen is a PowerPoint" presentation, said Bear Stearns
analyst Andrew Neff. "I haven't seen any execution."</TE>
<TE>   That execution will be critical if HP is to avoid the painful and
prolonged decline Hewlett and many HP employees fear.</TE>
<TE>   No merger of large technology companies has lived up to management
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   And because the financial logic of this deal is based on
eliminating $2.5 billion annually in overlapping jobs and product
lines, even Fiorina expects to lose about 5% of the merged firm's
revenue as customers walk away. Industry analysts said the real sales
loss could be triple that figure.</TE>
<TE>   Many big companies have policies against obtaining all their
computers or other goods from one supplier, and some buyers already
are switching because of uncertainly about which product lines will
stop being supported.</TE>
<TE>   "Short term, there will be an incredible amount of turmoil. Most
of the people will be in job-preservation mode, they won't be focused
on serving the customer," said analyst Ashok Kumar of US Bancorp
Piper Jaffray. "It leaves the flank open for competitors to come in.</TE>
<TE>   "No company has ever bought itself out of mediocrity. These guys
are trying to swim against the currents of history, and it's truly
unfortunate. The people who will pay for it are the shareholders and
the employees."</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the merger closes, Fiorina said Tuesday, the HP team
will "hit the ground running." Customers will be the first priority
as employees tell them who their contacts will be and which products
will survive.</TE>
<TE>   The second priority will be the employees, many of whom are
worried that they will be among the 15,000 to be laid off, about 10%
of the work force, beginning as soon as six weeks after the close.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the plans already are spelled out in the integration
team's documents, which are secret because of U.S. and European
antitrust rules. Their preparation has nonetheless been exhaustive.
The color of the new corporate badges has been picked. The new Web
site, which integrates automated help for both firms' customers, is
ready to go.</TE>
<TE>   One member of the team, Christine Politis, likens the process to
"planning a giant wedding. It's mind-boggling, the complexity."</TE>
<TE>   For Compaq, the issue is especially pointed. Its painful
experiences merging with supercomputer maker Tandem in 1997 and
Digital Equipment Corp. in 1998 were a major factor in Compaq
becoming a takeover target, and the mishandling of those integrations
led to CEO Michael Capellas' ascension.</TE>
<TE>   "People will have stamped on their foreheads what piece of that
$2.5 billion in savings they will be responsible for. That's the
accountability that we missed in our merger with Digital," said
Michael J. Winkler, Compaq executive vice president and a senior
member of the Clean Team.</TE>
<TE>   "We've made all the product road map decisions for the next three
years," Winkler said. "We have determined every factory that will
remain open and which will close. We have determined a go-to-market
strategy for our sales, distribution channels, call centers."</TE>
<TE>   Central to the plan is which products survive. With customers
uncertain, HP and Compaq will issue "security blankets" giving
customers options to trade in discontinued products for current wares
or extend warranties on old gear.</TE>
<TE>   Managers have chosen among competing products and immediately will
ax the losing lines, skirting the need to integrate two teams of
workers. Capellas this week gave hints about which key products would
survive from each firm.</TE>
<TE>   "Compaq is strong in fault-tolerant supercomputing. HP is strong
in Unix-based computing. Compaq leads in industry standard servers, a
market in which HP has not traditionally participated. Compaq is a
leading provider in mid-range storage, while HP has high-end storage.
Compaq sells system management software, a market in which HP is not
present," Capellas said.</TE>
<TE>   The integration team has spent time working out how to combine two
distinct corporate cultures. "Culture is not a phrase. It is how
people operate every day," Fiorina said.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry analysts are skeptical that any plan will obviate
the pain of merger. "Management will throw out their plan on day
one," said analyst Roger Kay of IDC in Framingham, Mass. "But somehow
things never work out that smoothly."</TE>
<TE>   HP shares fell 60 cents to $18.20 and Compaq lost 32 cents to
$10.82, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   HP is offering 0.6325 share for each Compaq share, valuing Compaq
stock at $11.51 based on HP's Wednesday close.</TE>

<HD>Kohl's Plans on 30 Stores for Debut</HD>
<DH>Retail: The chain is expected to appear in the Los Angeles
region next March as part of its Western expansion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kohl's Corp., the rapidly growing department store chain, will make
its long-anticipated push into Southern California next March, with
plans to open at least 30 stores on a single day, according to
developers, city planners and retail experts familiar with Kohl's
strategy.</LD>
<LD>   Kohl's, based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., has steadfastly declined
to give specifics about its expansion into the Los Angeles area. But
developers and government officials say they have identified about a
dozen sites in which Kohl's is in various stages of permitting and
development, including three in Los Angeles County, four in Orange
County and three in the Inland Empire. Kohl's has already begun
building a 652,000-square-foot warehouse in San Bernardino to support
the company's Western expansion.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts say the expected incursion by Kohl's--considered a hybrid
with qualities of both a department store and a discounter--is likely
to shake up the retail landscape in the way Nordstrom did when it
arrived in the Southland in 1978. Already, with Kmart Corp. having
filed for bankruptcy protection and other department stores
struggling amid continued encroachment by discounters, the retail
landscape is undergoing a major shift.</LD>
<TE>   And the battleground is particularly intense in the Los Angeles
area--a $122-billion retail market rivaled only by the New York
region.</TE>
<TE>   Target Stores and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. have already made
California a major priority, and even beleaguered Kmart is keeping
most of its stores open here as it reorganizes under Chapter 11.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to get kind of wild out there," said Jack Kyser, chief
economist at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., who
has been tracking developers' reports of Kohl's activity.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl's, which currently operates more than 380 stores in 29
states, has been expanding rapidly as its annual sales and profit
have surged. The company opened 62 stores in its last fiscal year,
and is looking to add 70 new stores this year and 80 in 2003, when it
also will enter Phoenix and Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   As in other regions, Kohl's is hoping to make a splashy entry with
multiple grand openings, a strategy that retailers have adopted to
get the most bang for their advertising bucks. Kohl's currently has
no stores in California.</TE>
<TE>   If all the developments come to fruition and Kohl's opens 30
stores, it would add roughly 5,000 jobs in the area. Some analysts,
however, say it will be difficult for Kohl's to acquire land in
certain places it may want to enter.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said the California openings will be the largest
ever for Kohl's on a single day.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unprecedented," said Douglas Gray, president of Eclipse
Development Group in Irvine, which intends to build centers in Downey
and Monterey Park anchored by Kohl's. "It is just an amazing
undertaking."</TE>
<TE>   Generally, the company opens its stores in areas outside of malls,
making it easy to get in and out of the store. The average store is
about 86,500 square feet and employs about 150 workers.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl's Ventura site, which has been approved by planners but still
needs building permits, would be the main anchor in a development
that will include a Barnes &amp; Noble, Staples and a Pier One Imports,
planner Veronica Alvarado said.</TE>
<TE>   Stores also are expected to open in Ladera Ranch, Downey, Rancho
Santa Margarita, La Habra, Fontana and possibly two in Corona and
other cities.</TE>
<TE>   For many Southland consumers, shopping at Kohl's will be a new
experience. The stores share some characteristics with discounters,
such as moderate prices, centralized checkout areas. But, like
department stores, they focus strongly on soft goods, especially
apparel.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl's, which describes itself as a "value-oriented specialty
department store," says its typical customer is women between the
ages of 25 and 54 with a family. Observers say Kohl's targets
customers who are very similar to Target shoppers, and often locates
near the discounter.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl's move into California also could mean trouble for Mervyn's,
a department store owned by Target Corp. that competes directly with
Kohl's, said Eric Beder, an analyst with the brokerage firm Ladenburg
Thalmann &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   While it is not certain that all planned California stores will
open, analysts say that Kohl's is financially sturdy enough to make
it happen, although its debt-load has increased. The company earned
$495.7 million on net sales of about $7.5 billion in its fiscal year
ended Feb. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl's stock closed Wednesday at $70.91, up 45 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange trading.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Drop as Investors Fear Rising Interest Rates</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Gloomy profit forecast for Intel helps drive
shares lower. Nasdaq sheds 2.6%. Bond yields jump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks suffered their biggest losses in a month and bond yields rose
sharply Wednesday on fears that rising interest rates will slow the
economic recovery and damp corporate profit growth.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street's mood also was darkened by a downbeat earnings
forecast for tech bellwether Intel by brokerage Salomon Smith Barney.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 133.68 points, or 1.3%, to
10,501.57. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped 18.44
points, or 1.6%, to 1,151.85.</LD>
<TE>   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index lost 48 points, or 2.6%, to
1,832.87.</TE>
<TE>   It was the biggest percentage loss for both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq
in a month.</TE>
<TE>   Losers led winners by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by
3 to 2 on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   The market's slippage followed the Federal Reserve's decision
Tuesday to leave interest rates unchanged, although the central bank
hinted of possible increases later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Though stocks rallied Tuesday, "it often happens after a Fed
meeting that investors think about it overnight and next day react
differently," said Joe Stocke, chief investment officer at StoneRidge
Investment Partners. Now, "they see rate increases down the road."</TE>
<TE>   That belief was bolstered by another dose of positive economic
news Wednesday. U.S. housing starts in February climbed at their
fastest pace in more than three years, the government said.</TE>
<TE>   The housing report, and accompanying concerns that the Fed may
begin raising interest rates this year, drove bond yields higher.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for home
mortgages, rose to 5.41% from 5.29% Tuesday. The yield on the
two-year T-note, one of the most sensitive to Fed rate moves, rose
from 3.54% to 3.67%--the highest since Sept. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Despite investors' qualms about rising rates, some analysts have
noted that stocks can perform well during periods of tightening
credit--as long as corporate earnings are robust.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Wednesday's selling was focused on tech shares. Intel, a
Dow component, declined $1.19 to $30.53 and was the second
most-active issue on Nasdaq. Salomon cut its earnings forecast on the
leading computer chip maker, citing lower seasonal demand and a
possibility of lower nonoperating income. The gloom rubbed off on
other issues and sent the SOX semiconductor index down 3.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Other tech losers included IBM, off $1.99 to $105.50, and
Microsoft, down $2.13 to $60.10.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Some brokerages slumped after reporting quarterly results that
disappointed Wall Street and on worries that higher rates will cut
into the value of the companies' bond holdings. Lehman Bros. lost
$1.30 to $64.93 after posting a drop in quarterly earnings amid an
unabated decline in stock underwriting. Bear Stearns fell $1.05 to
$62.10, even after the firm said fiscal first-quarter profit rose.</TE>
<TE>   * Bristol-Myers Squibb's shares tumbled $7.57 to $41.08--a 16%
loss--after researchers said its experimental drug Vanlev was not
better in treating heart failure than a treatment made by Merck.
Merck lost 34 cents to $58.08.</TE>
<TE>   * ViroPharma's shares dropped 59% after a government advisory
panel rejected the company's most advanced product, the experimental
cold medicine Picovir. The shares dropped $7.91 to $5.50 and the
stock was the biggest percentage decliner on U.S. markets.</TE>
<TE>   * Airline stocks fell on fears U.S. airlines may be adding flights
faster than the current economic recovery warrants. The Amex airline
index was down 4%, reflecting losses in Delta Air Lines shares, off
$1.44 to $32.64, and others.</TE>
<TE>   * Red Hat, provider of the Linux computer operating system, sank
$1.22 to $5.58 after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly sales
even as earnings met estimates. Among other software stocks, Siebel
Systems lost $3.22 to $31.58.</TE>
<TE>   * Alcon, the eye-care unit of Nestle, priced its initial stock
offering at $33 each. The shares will begin trading on the NYSE today
under the symbol ACL.</TE>

<HD>RealNetworks Alleges Bullying by Microsoft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An executive of RealNetworks Inc. accused Microsoft Corp. on
Wednesday of bullying computer makers and withholding key technical
information in a bid to cripple RealNetworks' competing audio and
video player.</LD>
<LD>   In written testimony to U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly, RealNetworks Vice President R. David Richards said
that as recently as last year, Microsoft delayed turning over
technical details needed to make the RealNetworks' multimedia player
work reliably with the Windows operating system.</LD>
<LD>   Richards also wrote that Microsoft threatened not to license some
of its products to tech heavyweights IBM Corp., Compaq Computer
Corp., America Online Inc. and others unless they agreed to drop
RealNetworks' software products.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft lawyer Richard Pepperman challenged the accusations in a
daylong cross-examination of Richards.</TE>
<TE>   Richards acknowledged that RealNetworks' share of the multimedia
market has grown rapidly despite Microsoft's alleged tactics. He also
said RealNetworks has struck as many as 39 exclusive licensing deals
with PC makers that potentially restricted Microsoft's competing
multimedia software.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, other potentially damaging testimony from Richards was
struck down as irrelevant or hearsay by Kollar-Kotelly.</TE>
<TE>   The judge excluded at least 13 of 220 paragraphs in Richards' 90
pages of written testimony. She also rejected a June 16, 2001, e-mail
submitted by the states in which AOL Chief Executive Barry Schuler
said Microsoft was trying to force AOL to drop RealNetworks products.</TE>
<TE>   They "want to kill you guys so badly, it is ugly," Schuler wrote
to RealNetworks executives.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly said she excluded the testimony because Richards
didn't have direct knowledge of the claims and was simply repeating
the conversations of others. Because Schuler was not called as a
witness to confirm the e-mail, the document was inadmissible, the
judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Richards was the third witness called by the District of Columbia
and a group of nine states seeking tougher punishment of Microsoft
for being found guilty of federal antitrust violations in June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The states have rejected a proposed settlement formally presented
to Kollar-Kotelly earlier this month by the Justice Department and
nine other states.</TE>

<LD>Fearing congressional scrutiny, General Electric's NBC television
network said Wednesday that it will stop accepting advertisements for
hard liquor, returning to network television's 54-year-old practice
of abstaining from such ads.</LD>
<LD>   After thinking it through, NBC executives realized that the
company had more to lose in breaking this taboo than it had to gain.
In December, NBC broke ranks with CBS, ABC and Fox to be the first
national broadcast network to run liquor advertising.</LD>
<LD>   NBC said it has limited its liquor company-sponsored messages to
about 50 public service announcements promoting responsible drinking
that ran after the prime-time hours. The PSAs were a prerequisite NBC
demanded of companies interested in running liquor product
promotions.</LD>
<TE>   Struggling with the advertising recession, NBC had hoped it could
tap more than $100million in new advertising revenue by running ads
for hard liquor, according to Jerry McGee, president of the Los
Angeles office of J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, which
represents liquor companies. With ads for spirits already running on
400 local broadcast stations across the country and 30 national cable
networks, NBC wanted a piece of the action.</TE>
<TE>   However, once Congress announced it would hold hearings on the
propriety of using the public airways to promote hard liquor, the
network realized that ads for all kinds of alcoholic beverages would
be called into question. Beer and wine ads currently funnel more than
$1 billion in revenue to broadcast networks each year.</TE>
<TE>   "NBC realized it ran a huge risk of actually losing current
sources of revenues," McGee said.</TE>
<TE>   That might have happened. Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), ranking
Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the
Internet, said he would have applauded such a review. "Had [this] led
to a discussion of beer and wine ads, that would have been a good
thing," said Markey, noting alcoholism's toll on society. "We were
attempting to hold the line here.</TE>
<TE>   "I applaud NBC for its decision today to end its experiment."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Califano Jr. of Columbia University's National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse called the decision "an important
victory for parents and children across the country."</TE>
<TE>   The network was criticized for its decision to carry ads for
Diageo's Smirnoff vodka by groups including the American Medical
Assn. and Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which had a news conference
on alcohol advertising scheduled for today. Diageo said in a
statement that it would continue discussions with NBC, but declined
to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the furor over NBC's plan to accept these commercial
spots, ads for distilled spirits such as Brown-Forman Corp.'s Jack
Daniels whiskey sold by local stations have appeared for years during
high-profile programs such as "The West Wing" and "ER" on NBC and the
Super Bowl broadcast on Fox. Local network affiliates, many of them
owned by the major networks, have been airing liquor ads since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The local ads never stirred a fraction of the controversy provoked
by the decision of NBC, which is considered a national standard
bearer.</TE>
<TE>   NBC acknowledged that congressional pressure had a role in its
decision, noting that it decided to drop the ads after a request from
the House and Senate Commerce Committee to reconsider the network's
December decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We said we were going to take into account all these various
points of view," said Alan Wurtzel, president NBC standards and
research. "We did, and we decided we weren't going to go forward."</TE>
<TE>   NBC ultimately decided that the new ads would not be worth the
risks.</TE>
<TE>   According to a statement from NBC, the standards for liquor ads
were more stringent than for other products.</TE>
<TE>   "We banned any symbol, animation, promotional character or
language intended to appeal to minors. NBC prohibited drinking in the
ads, glamorization of alcohol, and any suggestion that drinking is a
rite of passage or that distilled spirits will enhance anyone's
attractiveness, personal relationships or sexual prowess."</TE>
<TE>   The Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group representing liquor
makers, was disappointed by NBC's decision, charging that the network
was caving to pressure from the beer industry--one of the
highest-spending advertising sectors.</TE>
<TE>   "They say they buckled under to the critics," said Frank Coleman,
a spokesman for the council. "We say that too, but clearly beer wants
the marketplace to itself."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of General Electric fell fell $1.10 on Wednesday to $38.80
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The announcements were made after the close of regular U.S.
trading.</TE>

<HD>Home Building Surges, Boosting U.S. Recovery</HD>
<DH>Housing: Residential real estate was a pillar of strength
for the economy last year, and economists believe it will turn in a
solid performance this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. builders broke ground on single-family homes in February at the
fastest pace since the late 1970s, and economists say the sector that
helped offset the broader economic slump is set to assist in the
recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that overall housing starts
raced ahead by 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.77million last month, the fastest pace in more than three years.
Construction starts on single-family homes, the largest portion of
the larger number, rose 7.4% to a 1.46-million annual pace, the
strongest clip since December 1978.</LD>
<LD>   "The immediate implication for the economy is that the recovery,
which has gained a toehold on the beach, is moving inland," said Ken
Mayland, president of ClearView Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio.</LD>
<TE>   Housing growth often presages a rise in retail sales as consumers
move to furnish their new dwellings. Residential housing was a pillar
of strength for the economy last year, and economists believe it will
turn in a solid, although slightly less spectacular, performance in
2002.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Dederick, economic consultant for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said the starts report, which also showed an increase in
building permits issued for future home building, was a "picture of
unalloyed strength."</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first piece of evidence that, yes, final demand is
hanging in there nicely," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That prospect may cause the Federal Reserve to reassess how
quickly it wants to begin reversing the 11 interest rate cuts it made
in 2001 to lift the economy out of recession.</TE>
<TE>   The continued strength of housing could stimulate consumer
spending, and some analysts said that would help the economy post a
strong growth rate in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In California, builders pulled permits at an annual rate of
148,070 in January, down 15% from the month before and 20% from a
year earlier, according to state figures based on a monthly report
from the Construction Industry Research Board, a Burbank firm.
California's February data are not available yet.</TE>
<TE>   But Ben Bartolotto, who compiles the report, forecasts that
February data on construction of single- and multifamily projects in
California will decline about 3.5% from last year's estimated pace of
148,291 units. He said the sluggish economy, the threat of higher
interest rates and the lack of buildable land would curb production
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Miami-based Lennar Corp., the second-largest U.S. home builder,
reported Wednesday that profit rose 40% in its fiscal first quarter,
beating analysts' estimates. Most of the home sales during the
quarter were for homes ordered before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
however.</TE>
<TE>   Lennar's net income for the period ended Feb. 28 was $71.9
million, or $1.03 a share, up from $51.3million, or 75 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue increased 13% to $1.2billion, Chief Executive Stuart
Miller said. Shares fell $2.17 to at $52.62 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Pimco to Steer Clear of GE Debt</HD>
<DH>Investing: The mutual fund decides not to own the firm's
short-term IOUs because of belief it is borrowing too much.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Gross, manager of the world's largest bond mutual fund, said
Wednesday his Newport Beach-based Pacific Investment Management Co.
will not own General Electric Co.'s short-term debt "in the
foreseeable future" because GE has too much debt.</LD>
<LD>   Gross said that GE and its GE Capital Corp. finance arm, the
world's largest issuer of short-term IOUs known as commercial paper,
are borrowing too much at a time of shaken investor confidence in the
integrity of corporate accounting after Enron Corp.'s collapse.</LD>
<LD>   He also said he doesn't believe that GE Chief Executive Jeffrey
Immelt and predecessor Jack Welch have been "totally forthcoming" in
explaining how GE has been able to post earnings growth of nearly 15%
a year for decades.</LD>
<TE>   GE said Monday it expects 17% to 18% earnings growth from
continuing operations this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The corporation's honesty remains in doubt," said Gross in his
monthly "Investment Outlook" posted on Pimco's Web site. "I want
companies to face up to their owners and yes--their creditors."</TE>
<TE>   Gross said Pimco sold its $1 billion in GE Capital commercial
paper in the last week, after the unit issued $11 billion in new
long-term bonds and then filed to sell up to another $50 billion in
securities.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's level of short-term debt "is an extreme situation that
investors should rebuke and rebel against," Gross said in an
interview. "The sale of our paper was one small step in that
direction."</TE>
<TE>   GE Capital spokeswoman Marissa Moretti declined to comment
Wednesday on Gross' report.</TE>
<TE>   GE shares fell $1.10 to $38.80 on Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange amid a broad market decline.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, credit-rating firm Moody's Investors Service said GE
Capital, one of no more than 10 U.S. companies carrying triple-A
credit ratings, faces "funding risk" because it has backed up only
one-fourth of its $127 billion in short-term debt with bank credit
lines.</TE>
<TE>   Moretti said the company is working to increase that amount.</TE>
<TE>   Gross said General Electric's earnings have been helped by GE
Capital's low-cost borrowing. The company has used the money in part
to finance as many as 100 acquisitions over the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   GE Capital is using "near-hedge-fund leverage" and "its survival
depends on the confidence of outside investors," Gross said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Wednesday, GE spokesman Gary Sheffer rejected a
published report sourced to unnamed persons that GE last month
offered up to $8 billion to buy Tyco International Ltd.'s CIT Group
commercial finance arm.</TE>

<HD>Auditor Enters Not Guilty Plea to Obstruction of Justice
Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTEN HAYS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The Andersen accounting firm pleaded innocent Wednesday to criminal
charges that it obstructed justice by shredding tons of documents and
deleting computer files related to Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The hearing was the auditing firm's first since a federal grand
jury indictment was unsealed last week.</LD>
<LD>   "I plead not guilty," Gene Frauenheim, managing partner of the
accounting firm's Houston office, told U.S. Magistrate Calvin Botley
during the brief arraignment.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon, who ultimately will hear the
case, set a May 6 trial date and said she will see that it lasts just
three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Botley told Andersen's attorney, Rusty Hardin, that if the firm
decided to change its plea it would need to notify the court.</TE>
<TE>   "I can assure the court we will not change," Hardin said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courthouse, hundreds of chanting Andersen employees
protested the indictment, saying they aren't cowering from the
charges.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not involved in Enron and I bet you couldn't find six
people here who were," said Charlotte Williams, who has worked at
Andersen for 21 years. "We're going to stay until the lights go out
if necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Williams and other employees wearing "I am Arthur Andersen"
T-shirts chanted: "Drop the indictment! Save Andersen!"</TE>
<TE>   Hardin had said the company wants a jury trial to challenge what
he called the government's flimsy evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "An indictment is just as bad as a conviction in terms of the
company's reputation unless we get a quick trial and vindication,"
Hardin said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department's first indictment related to Enron's
collapse was unsealed last week. In the indictment, Andersen is
accused of obstructing justice by shredding tons of documents and
deleting computer files related to Enron audits.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment said high-level Andersen management officials held
a conference call to discuss the onset of a Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry of Enron in October. Dozens of trunks then were
obtained to haul paper from Andersen's offices in the Enron building
to the auditing firm's Houston office for shredding, according to the
indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen vehemently challenged the allegations, calling them
"couched in broad, vague and conclusory terms. They offer no detail
at all, and fail even to identify by name the higher-ups at Arthur
Andersen LLP who the government believes masterminded the document
destruction."</TE>

<HD>Junk Bond Default Rate Falls in Feb. From 11-Year High</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A key measure of the default rate on corporate junk bonds fell in
February from an 11-year high in January, and probably will head
lower as the U.S. economy improves, credit-rating firm Moody's
Investors Service said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The news may attract more investors to junk securities, which have
rallied sharply recently.</LD>
<LD>   Through February, the 12-month default rate for junk bonds
worldwide fell to 10.54% of bonds outstanding from 10.68% in January,
Moody's said. Junk bonds are securities rated below investment grade.</LD>
<TE>   An average of 21 companies and $9 billion in bonds defaulted each
month last year as the recession left many heavily indebted firms
unable to service their debts.</TE>
<TE>   "You would need a severe economic downturn for those numbers to
persist, and the economy instead looks like it's turning around,"
said David Hamilton, Moody's director of default research in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   As investors sense that the risk of junk bond defaults is
declining, money has poured into the sector in recent weeks in an
effort to lock in still-high yields. A yield index of 100 junk bonds
tracked by KDP Investment Advisors stood at 10.34% on Wednesday, down
from 11.29% on Feb. 22.</TE>

<TE>   Fannie Mae to Disclose Insider Transactions</TE>
<TE>   Executives at mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae will begin posting
their personal stock transactions in Fannie shares on the company's
Web site within days of the trade dates.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae Chief Executive Franklin Raines said Wednesday that the
company decided to follow the recommendations made recently by
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt regarding
insider disclosure in the aftermath of Enron Corp.'s collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Congress is considering mandating speedy executive stock
transaction disclosure but has not yet acted. Depending on when they
buy or sell, executives' trades may not become public information for
up to 40 days after a trade.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae has been under fire in Congress for disclosure issues
unrelated to insider transactions. Because the company is
congressionally chartered, it does not have to file with the SEC its
plans to raise capital in stock or debt markets with new securities.</TE>
<TE>   Some in Congress have expressed concerns about debt levels at
Fannie Mae and its sister mortgage company, Freddie Mac. House
Republicans such as Reps. Christopher Shays of Connecticut and
Richard H. Baker of Louisiana are considering legislation to remove
the companies' exemption from SEC registration requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae shares fell 96 cents to $79.04 and Freddie Mac lost
$1.20 to $63.40, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Padilla Faces Renewed Threat to Presidency</HD>
<DH>Politics: Council members say he needs to put his ambitions
on hold and be a neutral statesman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Council President Alex Padilla went for broke
campaigning for Tony Cardenas over Wendy Greuel for the 2nd District
seat. Now that Greuel has been declared the winner in that bitter
race, talk has begun anew among council members about ousting Padilla
from the presidency.</LD>
<LD>   In a sharp turnabout, some council members who helped elect
Padilla to the presidency say they need to be convinced that he
deserves to keep the post.</LD>
<LD>   Although the city lawmakers say they are reluctant to lead a coup
that would destabilize the council, Padilla's colleagues have placed
him on a probation of sorts, warning him that he needs to put his
political ambitions on hold and become a neutral statesman like his
predecessor, the late Councilman John Ferraro.</LD>
<TE>   "Alex clearly needs now to focus internally on this body and show
that he is willing to live up to his commitment as leader of the
council," said Councilman Eric Garcetti, who helped elect Padilla to
the presidency. "From his strongest allies to his biggest critics, he
really needs to prove himself right now."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's strong support for Cardenas added fuel to the fire. To
spite him, some of his colleagues supported Greuel, hoping her
victory would signal the end of the young councilman's presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are bailing out on the other side because they
see the writing is on the wall," said Councilman Hal Bernson, one of
Padilla's most outspoken critics. "We need someone who is a little
more capable, a little more mature, who brings the City Council
together on issues rather than dividing the council."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla shrugs off the criticism. He knows he could lose the
position any time his colleagues can garner eight votes, but he said
he's not worried.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been talk like this since the beginning of my
presidency. I'm focused on the work at hand," Padilla said. "I'm
continuing to work hard every day. I'm trying to work with every
single member of the council."</TE>
<TE>   He scoffs at the suggestion that he should become less political.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a political process," said Padilla, who vigorously
campaigned and raised money for Cardenas. "And we are all elected
officials."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla has alienated some council members since July, when his
colleagues voted 9 to 5 to make him president, beating Ruth Galanter.
Shortly after gaining the post, he made a number of controversial
moves, including ousting Bernson and other long-timers from their
committee assignments. In November, council members--including
Bernson, Mark Ridley-Thomas and Nate Holden--began discussing a
possible coup.</TE>
<TE>   The lawmakers--who complained that Padilla is too inexperienced to
hold the job that gives him control over the council's agenda--said
they would wait until the District 2 election was over.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with Greuel set to take office within two weeks, Padilla's
foes privately say they want to act. (Ridley-Thomas and Holden both
declined to comment publicly on the matter.)</TE>
<TE>   Officials have become so preoccupied with discussing Padilla's
fate that they are even joking about it.</TE>

Hahn at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, former Assembly Speaker Bob

<TE>   Padilla replied, "Tell me what emeritus feels like."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Janice Hahn used a Magic 8-Ball to peer into
Padilla's future.</TE>
<TE>   "Does Alex Padilla have the eight votes to remain as City Council

<TE>   The councilwoman turned over the 8-Ball and read, "A grueling

tonight, Alex," Hahn said. "I know you realize she's going to be your

<HD>Padilla Facing Renewed Threat to Presidency</HD>
<DH>Politics: Although council members are hesitant to stage a
coup, they say he needs to be a neutral statesman.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Council President Alex Padilla went for broke
campaigning for Tony Cardenas over Wendy Greuel for the 2nd District
seat. Now that Greuel has been declared the winner in that bitter
race, talk has begun anew among council members about ousting Padilla
from the presidency.</LD>
<LD>   In a sharp turnabout, some council members who helped elect
Padilla to the presidency say they need to be convinced that he
deserves to keep the post.</LD>
<LD>   Although the city lawmakers say they are reluctant to lead a coup
that would destabilize the council, Padilla's colleagues have placed
him on a probation of sorts, warning him that he needs to put his
political ambitions on hold and become a neutral statesman like his
predecessor, the late Councilman John Ferraro.</LD>
<TE>   "Alex clearly needs now to focus internally on this body and show
that he is willing to live up to his commitment as leader of the
council," said Councilman Eric Garcetti, who helped elect Padilla to
the presidency. "From his strongest allies to his biggest critics, he
really needs to prove himself right now."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's strong support for Cardenas added fuel to the fire. To
spite him, some of his colleagues supported Greuel, hoping her
victory would signal the end of the young councilman's presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are bailing out on the other side because they
see the writing is on the wall," said Councilman Hal Bernson, one of
Padilla's most outspoken critics. "We need someone who is a little
more capable, a little more mature, who brings the City Council
together on issues rather than dividing the council."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla shrugs off the criticism. He knows he could lose his
position any time his colleagues can garner eight votes, but he said
he's not worried.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been talk like this since the beginning of my
presidency. I'm focused on the work at hand," Padilla said. "I'm
continuing to work hard every day. I'm trying to work with every
single member of the council."</TE>
<TE>   He also scoffs at the suggestion that he should become less
political.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a political process," said Padilla, who vigorously
campaigned and raised money for Cardenas. "And we are all elected
officials."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla has alienated some council members since July, when his
colleagues voted 9 to 5 to make him president, beating Ruth Galanter.
Shortly after his colleagues placed him in the leadership position,
Padilla made a number of controversial moves, including ousting
Bernson and other long-timers from their committee assignments. In
November, council members--including Bernson, Mark Ridley-Thomas and

said in an interview that he is not considering the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of speculation going on in and near the council,
and by and large I find it to be a nonproductive use of our time and
energy," Weiss said. "As far as I'm concerned, this matter is not
before me."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel says she wants to stay above the fray. "I'm going to work
with every council member, including Alex," she said. "It is not at
all about hard feelings. I'm focusing on being the most effective
council member I can be."</TE>
<TE>   She said she is not even thinking about voting for a new council
president. "It's not the first thing on my agenda," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said he hopes to meet with Greuel in the coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking about issues. We are talking about her district.
We've had a good relationship since before her candidacy. I think she
understood the relationship I have with Tony and we look forward to
working together," Padilla said.</TE>

<HD>Chavez-Columbus Debate No Holiday for Council</HD>
<DH>Dispute: A day off to honor labor leader replaces day for
explorer--for now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with the sometimes choppy waters of ethnic politics, the Los
Angeles City Council on Wednesday could have used the navigating
prowess of Christopher Columbus and the negotiating skills of Cesar
Chavez.</LD>
<LD>   The touchy issue at hand: whether to allow 2,000 city employees to
take Cesar Chavez Day as a paid city holiday instead of Columbus Day.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal drew a storm of protest from the Italian American
community, including a letter of opposition signed by former Dodger
Manager Tommy Lasorda, actor Joe Mantegna and Democratic strategist
Joe Cerrell, among others.</LD>
<TE>   Italian Americans do not oppose declaring Cesar Chavez's birthday
a city holiday, said Cerrell, also president of the National Italian
American Foundation. But they vigorously oppose taking city holiday
status away from Columbus Day, an action ''which we interpret to be
racist, anti-Italian American,'' said Cerrell, one of about a dozen
Italian Americans to address the council.</TE>
<TE>   ''As one who met Cesar Chavez ... I think he would be appalled at
what they are trying to do today,'' Cerrell said.</TE>
<TE>   The freewheeling debate included a shouting match between
Councilmen Hal Bernson and Nate Holden. In the back of the council
chambers, a bust of the late John Ferraro, former council president
and proud Italian American, seemed to be averting its eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The council decided to give the employees Cesar Chavez Day off
instead of Columbus Day for this year but--offering an olive
branch--also agreed to see if the unions representing city workers
would accept changes in future years that would not offend either
community.</TE>
<TE>   One option would be to give both days as paid holidays, but an
additional day off would cost the city about $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   City employees already have at least 12 holidays a year, depending
on the union they belong to.</TE>
<TE>   Since some unions have yet to finalize their new contracts, only
about half the city employees will get Monday off to commemorate
Chavez's birthday, which is actually March 31, while the other half
will take off Oct. 14 as Columbus Day.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, founder of the United Farm Workers union, died in 1993.
The state made his birthday a holiday in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus Day has long been a national holiday to honor the Italian
explorer who discovered America.</TE>
<TE>   ''If a person with such a tremendous accomplishment is no longer
to be honored, then who should be?'' they asked in a letter to the
council.</TE>
<TE>   The vote was 8 to 4, with council members Nate Holden, Nick
Pacheco, Jan Perry and Ed Reyes in opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes said the city should honor both Columbus and Chavez. ''We
should not be devaluing either the memory of Cesar Chavez or
Columbus,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Former City Councilman Mike Hernandez said that when he and others
first proposed commemorating Cesar Chavez's birthday, it was not
their intent to pit one ethnic group against another.</TE>
<TE>   During negotiations, the unions refused to swap a floating holiday
for Cesar Chavez Day, insisting that another holiday be swapped, City
Administrative Officer William Fujioka said.</TE>
<TE>   The three-year contracts with six unions, including management and
inspection employees, were negotiated in good faith, and, as a
result, employees involved were expecting to have Monday off, Fujioka
said.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council could have faced unfair bargaining complaints
from the unions if the holiday switch had not been approved, at least
for this year, council members said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Janice Hahn said that if the city budget improves
next year, it might help solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   ''This year we are in a bit of a bind,'' Hahn said. ''We should go
forward with what we negotiated in good faith.''</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm disappointed,'' said Russ Rametta, president of the
California Commission for Social Justice, Order Sons of Italy in
America.</TE>
<TE>   Cerrell, whose firm does lobbying at City Hall as well as
political strategy, said the council offer to revisit the matter for
future years was better than nothing.</TE>
<TE>   ''I can live with one year,'' Cerrell said afterward. ''Italians
are lovers, not fighters.''</TE>

<HD>Trial Begins for Alleged Leaders of Street Gang</HD>
<DH>Court: The couple are accused of running a drug-protection
ring earning $85,000 weekly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank "Pancho Villa" Martinez was a tattooed Mexican Mafia member
serving time in federal prison for being in the United States
illegally, while his wife, Janie Garcia, collected food stamps and
recycled discarded cans in her Monterey Park neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   But behind the veneer of poverty, a federal prosecutor charged in
court Wednesday, the couple earned hundreds of thousands of dollars
running one of the most lucrative street gangs in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The Columbia Li'l Cycos raked in about $85,000 a week--more than
$4.4 million a year--providing protection to street-level drug
dealers in the MacArthur Park neighborhood, Assistant U.S. Atty. Luis
Li said during opening statements in the racketeering trial of
Martinez, Garcia and two accused subordinates.</LD>
<TE>   When FBI agents raided homes occupied by Garcia, her mother and
sister in 1999, Li said, they seized about $450,000 in ill-gotten
cash.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, the couple had acquired three homes, several
vehicles, a restaurant and a used car business.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, 38, Garcia, 51, and co-defendants Anthony Zaragoza, 29,
of Maywood and Alberto Pina, 29, of Los Angeles are also accused of
complicity in three gang-retribution slayings and three attempted
murders.</TE>
<TE>   In their opening remarks to the jury, defense lawyers said their
clients were innocent and asked the panelists to keep an open mind.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty members or associates of the Li'l Cycos, a clique of the
notorious 18th Street gang, have previously pleaded guilty in the
case. They include Garcia's sister and daughter and Zaragoza's wife
and father.</TE>
<TE>   Pleading guilty in January was Ismael Jimenez, 24, of Los Angeles,
who two years earlier received a $231,000 settlement from the city
over his beating by a police officer inside the Rampart Division
station house in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The Li'l Cycos turf was in the area patrolled by Rampart's
anti-gang unit, which was disbanded after allegations of illegal
shootings, beatings and evidence planting.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is being held in a high-security courtroom in the
downtown Roybal federal building. About a dozen relatives and friends
of the defendants attended Wednesday's session.</TE>
<TE>   Li told the jury that he and co-prosecutor Bruce Riordan would
present incriminating evidence from more than 400 court-approved
wiretaps and numerous letters and coded financial records seized
during a three-year investigation headed by FBI agents.</TE>
<TE>   In sketching out the prosecution's case, Li said that while
Martinez was serving time in prison for returning to the U.S. after
being deported, Garcia acted as his proxy, receiving "taxes" or
"rents" collected by gang members from dope dealers on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, he said, the gang protected the dealers from poachers
and robbers. The prosecutor described the area controlled by the gang
as a "veritable outdoor emporium" for crack cocaine, heroin and
marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   He said well-heeled professionals and businessmen working in
nearby downtown high-rises found it convenient to buy illicit drugs
there.</TE>
<TE>   Zaragoza, who has gang insignias tattooed on his cheek and neck,
was described by Li as a gang "shot caller" in charge of seeing to it
that Martinez's orders were carried out.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor quoted from letters Zaragoza wrote from jail
referring to Martinez as "dad" and to Garcia as "mom."</TE>
<TE>   In one letter to Garcia, Zaragoza expressed his appreciation to
"dad" for giving him an "allowance of five and a half weekly" while
behind bars. Li said that meant $5,500 a week, or $286,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Zaragoza's lawyer opted to respond to the government's allegations
later in the trial, but attorneys for the other defendants offered
rebuttals.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez's lawyer, Gerald Scotti, said his client may seem like
"an unsavory character from the things he said, but he never killed
anybody or ordered anyone to be killed."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia's attorney, Terrence Roden, said his client was simply
holding money given to her for safekeeping and never knew where it
came from. He accused the prosecution of quoting out of context from
wiretapped telephone conversations between Garcia and Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Marcia Brewer, who represents Pina, said he was not an active
participant in the gang when the alleged crimes took place.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is expected to last about two months. If convicted of
racketeering charges, the four defendants could receive life prison
terms.</TE>

<HD>Families Don't Meet Rules on Foster Care</HD>
<DH>Children: Most violate standards required for nonrelatives,
a study in L.A. finds. U.S. may halt funding if conditions don't
improve.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new study of foster homes in Los Angeles has found that 99% of
relatives caring for foster children failed to meet current health
and safety standards in their homes.</LD>
<LD>   The study of 200 randomly selected households by the county's
child welfare agency found problems ranging from crowded
conditions--children in 79 homes were sleeping in the same beds or
rooms with adults, on mattresses or sleeping bags on the floor, on
couches or in kitchens, dining rooms or closets--to unsanitary or
hazardous conditions. Among those were roach infestations, plumbing
problems and homes and yards filled with garbage.</LD>
<LD>   Weapons and ammunition were not secured in eight homes. Security
bars in some homes lacked safety release devices. Some residences
with pools lacked fences, self-latching gates or covers.</LD>
<TE>   In 25 cases, relatives had not been checked for criminal records
or against the child abuse registry--some were allowed to take the
children by simply signing affidavits swearing that they had not been
convicted of a crime.</TE>
<TE>   The consequences of such widespread failure are twofold: They
demonstrate that many foster children in Los Angeles may be living in
unhealthy, even dangerous environments. They also bolster charges by
the federal government that California for years failed to hold
relatives of foster children to the same standards enforced against
nonrelative foster parents.</TE>
<TE>   That charge, which state officials deny, threatens to cost the
state government as much as $300 million if federal authorities
conclude that the state did not equalize the standards between
relative and nonrelative foster parents as required two years ago.
That amounts to 40% of all the money that California receives for the
care and monitoring of foster children.</TE>
<TE>   Some child advocates are furious that the state has put off
raising the relative standards for so long.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is that children should not have to choose between
living in a home with a relative who loves them and being in a home
that is safe, hygienic and clean," said Carole Shauffer, executive
director of the San Francisco-based Youth Law Center. "There's no
evidence that [the government] has even attempted to help them meet
these standards. We're talking in some cases about a bed, basic
plumbing, telephones--these are not high-level standards."</TE>
<TE>   But some say the overwhelming failure rate raises questions about
the standards. Some social workers and child welfare officials argue
that they allow too little leeway in assessing whether a home is
appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not offended by someone sleeping on a mattress on the floor,"
said Anita Bock, head of the Los Angeles Department of Children and
Family Services. "This may be shocking to people, but this is not an
unusual circumstance in many poor homes."</TE>
<TE>   The state's position is that because it has required relative and
nonrelative homes to be assessed for health and safety, it doesn't
matter that the individual standards under those categories may be
different.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the state passed emergency legislation that it said
was intended to clarify that the standards are the same, although
many acknowledge that it did bring up some safety standards for
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Counties were required to comply with the new standards in
January. Los Angeles, home to about 15,000 of the state's 35,000
foster children who live with relatives, changed its rules last fall
in anticipation of the new state requirements. Any relatives who
became foster parents since then have been held to the new, higher
standard, according to Bock.</TE>
<TE>   The 200 homes in the study were assessed in December and January,
but the county is still struggling to help them come into compliance.</TE>
<TE>   11-Month-Old Baby Starved to Death</TE>
<TE>   It will be a slow process to reassess all existing relative foster
homes, Bock said, because her study shows that their needs dwarf the
$1 million the state has set aside to aid all of the state's relative
foster parents. Behind the numbers, there is at least one life that
the new rules could have saved.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, five months after the federal government required
equal standards for foster parents, Danzel Bailey was removed from
his drug-addicted mother when he was a few days old and sent to live
with his grandmother--under conditions that fell below those required
by the current standards.</TE>
<TE>   Danzel starved to death 11 months later as he slept on a foam pad
on the floor of the one-bedroom apartment, a few feet from the bed
shared by his grandmother, teenage aunt and toddler brother.</TE>
<TE>   But social workers who investigate child abuse and neglect say
there are many homes that, while crowded, are loving and generally
safe.</TE>
<TE>   They complain that the new rules remove almost all of the
flexibility they used to have in overlooking such deficiencies and
old or irrelevant criminal records in their overall assessment of a
relative's home. The result, they say, is a rise in the number of
children taken to emergency shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Mecca, head of the County Welfare Directors Assn. of
California, said that was a concern from the moment the new federal
rules were handed down in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of shock and confusion and there were those who
could not believe that the federal government wanted us to license
relatives to the same degree" as nonrelative foster parents, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Shaw, principal consultant with the Assembly Human Services
Committee, says that the underlying issue is that California does not
think it should hold relatives to the same standards as nonrelative
foster parents.</TE>
<TE>   "California did not want to reduce the standard for professional,
nonrelative licensed foster parents," he said. "But we did not want
to require family members to go through the licensing process as long
as they meet basic safety standards and didn't have a criminal
record."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than deal with the propriety issue directly, Sylvia
Pizzini, deputy director of the state's Children and Family Services
Division, has continued to insist that the standards are
substantially the same.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the federal government said long-standing state rules
allowing some requirements to be waived only for relatives in fact
created a separate standard and has repeatedly told the state in
writing that it should not be billing the federal government for
those relative foster homes that do not meet federal standards.</TE>
<TE>   State May Not Meet U.S. Guidelines</TE>
<TE>   There is some question as to whether even the current state
standards satisfy the federal government. In her most recent letter
to the state in November, Sharon Fujii, head of the Pacific region of
the Administration for Children and Families, said last year's
legislation seemed on target but raised concerns over rules that
continue to allow some standards to be waived only for relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the new standards are satisfactory, Fujii wrote Pizzini,
they are more than a year late. The federal government gave states
nine months to comply, but said it would not pay to support foster
children in relatives' homes that did not meet its standards after
that.</TE>
<TE>   Federal reimbursement "cannot be claimed for foster care payments
made for children placed in unlicensed relative foster family homes
as of Sept. 28, 2000," she wrote. "Given the large percentage of
foster care children placed with relatives in California, we expect
significantly reduced fiscal claims ... until the state fully
implements the relative licensing provision required by regulation."</TE>
<TE>   California has not reduced its claims, and Pizzini said the
federal government has so far continued to pay them.</TE>
<TE>   One estimate that was circulated during last year's emergency
legislation to meet federal standards found that by January the delay
would cost the state about $287million in payments to relative
caretakers plus the costs of social workers and administration
connected to those cases. The sum has only grown since then. Pizzini
disputes this sum, but did not provide an alternative figure, saying
simply that it is "a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   She wrote a four-page letter to Fujii last month arguing that
California ought to be able to keep the money and continue to receive
federal funds for all relative foster parents, continuing to argue
that the standards were always the same.</TE>
<TE>   "We're waiting to hear back from them," she said.</TE>

<HD>Court Commissioner's Son Gets Home Probation in Killing of
3 Pedestrians</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The teenage son of a Pomona court commissioner was sentenced
Wednesday to home probation for an unspecified period and 500 hours
of community service for killing three pedestrians when his vehicle
careered into a crowd near a Pasadena school two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Judge Caryl Lee also suspended 18-year-old Jarett
Olson's driver's license for a year and ordered him to pay
restitution to the victims' families. He also must attend a program
that includes a visit to a hospital morgue.</LD>
<LD>   Olson recently admitted to three misdemeanor counts of vehicular
manslaughter. He had been charged with three felony counts of
vehicular manslaughter and one felony count of reckless driving
resulting in great bodily harm.</LD>
<TE>   "He made an open plea, and the judge made a fair and just
decision," said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles
County district attorney's office. She said the judge followed a
probation officer's recommendation for sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Olson's sport utility vehicle hit families outside Chandler School
on April 29, 2000, killing Sarah Karesh, 34, and daughter Madison, 3.
Nicholas Montoya, 4, died later of head injuries. Prosecutors said
Olson's vehicle swerved into oncoming traffic then hit the families
on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Olson, of Pasadena, was charged in Juvenile Court because he was
16 at the time of the incident. If he had been an adult, he could
have received up to three years in prison, Gibbons said.</TE>

<LD>The airport director who skirted security before boarding a plane to
Dallas, causing dozens of people to be rescreened at the Texas
airport, said he "totally screwed up."</LD>
<LD>   Charles Hayes, transportation director at Fresno Yosemite
International Airport, said he didn't realize he had bypassed the
security checkpoint Thursday until the plane landed. Hayes said he
arrived at the airport late and avoided security when he tried to
catch a baggage cart headed to the plane. When he walked up to the
plane, personnel told him to check in at the ticket counter and go
through screening.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, he went to the gate and checked his bag. "I thought I was
trying to save time for American and ended up causing more problems,"
he said.</LD>

<HD>Group Aims to Give Voters More Say in Government</HD>

<LD>Acknowledging rampant public mistrust of government, the Orange
County Business Council launched an effort this week designed to
restore faith in local elected leaders and invited residents to get
involved.</LD>
<LD>   The council unveiled its Center for a New Orange County to a room
filled with government and elected leaders, who often squirmed at how
they are viewed outside their offices.</LD>
<LD>   The intent is to bring one or more initiatives before voters as a
way to make government more responsive, the business council's Julie
Puentes said. Voters this month approved a new county charter, which
contains a section on filling vacancies on the Board of Supervisors.
The rest of the charter can be determined with later votes, Puentes
said.</LD>
<TE>   Focus groups conducted with county residents last month found that
suspicion of government and institutions is higher here than
elsewhere in the country, said Dan Yankelovich of Viewpoint Learning
Inc., which conducted the meetings.</TE>
<TE>   That mistrust translated into support for slowing growth and
spurning government, he said. Both were defense mechanisms born of a
lack of confidence in government's ability to handle problems, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who tend to believe that government is able to solve
problems were distrustful of local elected leaders, said Stan
Oftelie, the business council's executive director. "They don't think
that what government is doing is necessarily bad, they just can't
find [what they're doing]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the focus group participants said that fixing the county's
ailing sewage systems, streets and freeways, cleaning up pollution
and accommodating growth are the most pressing priorities.</TE>

<HD>Demski Ruled a Suicide</HD>
<DH>Death: The coroner's office says the Long Beach icon known
for his U.S. flag overdosed on a painkiller.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The death of Thomas "Ski" Demski, famous for owning the world's
largest United States flag, was ruled a suicide, Los Angeles County
coroner's officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Demski, 72, overdosed on Tramadol, a painkiller similar to codeine
in its effects, said David Campbell, a coroner's office spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   The drug was prescribed to him the day before his death Jan.19,
Campbell said. It is not known why it was prescribed, but friends
told authorities that Demski had been battling depression, Campbell
said.</LD>
<TE>   Demski had undergone multiple bypass surgery; suffered from heart
disease, diabetes and gangrene; and last year told a Times columnist
that "I'm just waiting to roll over and die."</TE>
<TE>   But at his funeral in January, the silver-bearded Long Beach
resident was remembered for his obvious patriotism and sense of
humor.</TE>
<TE>   Though most men are taken to their final resting place in a fancy
suit and oak casket, the eccentric Demski was buried shirtless in a
mirrored, plexiglass coffin. His tattoos of flags, eagles and Santa
Claus were on display for the hundreds of mourners who came to pay
their last respects.</TE>
<TE>   Demski was best known for his prized flags, one of which is the
size of three football fields and weighs more than 3,000 pounds. It
cost $80,000 and was made to earn the Guinness Book of Records'
largest flag designation. Super Flag, as Demski called it, was
unfurled on the grounds of the Washington Monument on Flag Day 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Other Demski flags have been displayed at Hoover Dam as the
Olympic torch was carried across in 1996 and at numerous Super Bowls.
Demski's flags covered the field at Dodger Stadium for the first home
game and the Rose Bowl field for UCLA's first football game after the
events of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the most poignant display of patriotism came in
October when Demski hung one of his flags at the site of the former
World Trade Center in New York City.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved an ordinance
Wednesday that will keep housing available to tenants who receive
assistance from a federal subsidy program.</LD>
<LD>   The amendment to the city's rent control ordinance makes it
illegal for owners of rent-controlled buildings to opt out of the
Section 8 program or to terminate existing contracts with Section 8
tenants.</LD>
<LD>   As the housing market has tightened, landlords have fled the
program and reaped higher rents on the open market.</LD>
<TE>   Last year alone, landlords in Los Angeles terminated 6,000 Section
8 contracts, displacing people from their homes and leaving others
unable to find housing.</TE>
<TE>   Rod Field of the Los Angeles Housing Law Project lamented the loss
of affordable-housing contracts, but said the council's action will
provide protection to those who remain in the program.</TE>
<TE>   "At least those who do have Section 8 can be assured that they're
not going to have the contracts terminated just so the landlord can
re-rent the apartment at a higher rent," Field said.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment also gives the Los Angeles Housing Department new
powers to investigate evictions related to the federal housing
vouchers in units subject to the city's rent control law.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important," said Garry Pinney, general manager of the
Housing Department.</TE>
<TE>   The Apartment Owners Assn. of Greater Los Angeles has called the
amendment "misguided and unconstitutional." Association leaders plan
to ask Mayor James K. Hahn to veto it.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Beyond the Glory"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Fox Sports Net, Sunday, 8 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   When Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning was diagnosed with a rare
kidney disease called focal glormerulosclerosis in 2000, for which
there is no cure, it was another chapter in a life that hasn't been
easy or without pain.</TE>
<TE>   This edition of "Beyond the Glory" will take a look at Mourning's
basketball career as well as his sometimes complicated life. Born in
Chesapeake, Va., in 1970, Mourning grew up quickly in more ways than
one. He had battles on the basketball court and also battles in
custody court. When his parents divorced, a judge gave young Alonzo
the option of living with either parent. He opted to be placed in the
state's foster care system.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just looking for some answers back then and I didn't want
to be around that type of atmosphere," Mourning says. "I wasn't a
happy child."</TE>
<TE>   After bouncing around the system, Mourning ended up at the home of
Fannie Threet. Mourning was one of 49 foster children reared by
Threet.</TE>
<TE>   He got into trouble for associating with a drug dealer while at
Georgetown and his professional career has had some bumps in the
road. One came when he was kicked out of a 1998 playoff game for
fighting with Larry Johnson of the New York Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   But the show presents a balanced picture of Mourning, who has also
done a lot of good things and is heavily involved in charitable work
through his foundation.</TE>

<TE>   A federal appeals court in Boston upheld a jury's decision to

is an illegal monopoly designed to depress salaries.</TE>
<TE>   The players filed a class-action antitrust lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in 1997, accusing MLS of keeping salaries low to
increase profits, and of conspiring with the U.S. Soccer Federation
to eliminate competition for top players.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, after a three-month trial, a jury agreed with
owners that the market was not limited to Division I soccer in the
United States, and that there was competition in Europe and in Latin
America, and in minor and indoor U.S. leagues.</TE>

<HD>Yucaipa Player's Suspension Upheld</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Yucaipa High baseball player removed from the team earlier this
month after missing practice to work at a polling station to earn
credit for his U.S. government class will not be allowed back on the
team, the Yucaipa High Athletic Council determined.</LD>
<LD>   Brandon Hardesty, a senior outfielder and pitcher, said he told
Yucaipa Coach Jeff Stout the day before the March 5 elections that he
would miss the after-school practice, but Stout said that was not a
valid excuse. When he showed up for practice the day after the
elections, Hardesty was summoned to Stout's office, where Hardesty
claimed Stout told him to remove his uniform at once because he was
no longer on the team. Hardesty said he complied and left Stout's
office in his underwear.</LD>
<LD>   Hardesty said it wasn't until after the suspension that Stout said
he was not permitted to miss practice because he did not give the
required 24-hour notice. He was suspended for insubordination.</LD>
<TE>   Officials from the school and the Yucaipa-Calabasas Unified School
District would not comment on the suspension but issued a statement
that read: "After hearing the statements and information from Brandon
Hardesty, Mr. and Mrs. Hardesty, and the baseball coaching staff and
the coordinator of the poll worker training [program], the Athletic
Council unanimously determined that the suspension be upheld and
should continue for the remainder of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Hardesty said he doesn't plan to appeal the suspension.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to make sure this won't happen to anyone else,"
Hardesty said. "I want the way they suspend people to be reviewed. It
wasn't made clear that missing practice would result in me being
dropped from the team."</TE>

<KH>SPOTLIGHT ON HIGH SCHOOL TRACK</KH>
<HD>Grant Joins the Long List of Stars at Arroyo Grande</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Ortega</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is not in Billie Jo Grant's nature to rest on her laurels.</LD>
<LD>   But if it were, the junior shotputter and discus thrower at Arroyo
Grande High would have a hard time doing so because of the track and
field program of which she's a member.</LD>
<LD>   Arroyo Grande has a history of producing outstanding throwers
since the early 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   So when Grant uncorked a throw of 164 feet 6 inches in the girls'
discus in a meet last Thursday against visiting San Luis Obispo, she
moved to the top of the yearly national list but found herself well
short of the school and Southern Section record of 181-3 set by
Stephanie Brown in winning the 1998 state title.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredible to me that I could be the national leader right
now, but someone is still 17 feet ahead of me," Grant said. "But
[Coach Robert Budke] has done a phenomenal job here."</TE>
<TE>   Budke, 33, coached the discus throwers at Arroyo Grande from
1987-94 before taking over all the throwers in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo Grande throwers have won six state titles in either the
shotput or discus since then and at least one thrower from the school
has placed third or better in the state championships from 1994-2001.</TE>
<TE>   Grant was unaware of Arroyo Grande's tradition until her freshman
year when Budke instructed throwers David Rivera and Sean Shields,
last season's state champion in the boys' discus, to encourage her to
go out for the track team.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of roped into it," said Grant, who has also lettered
in basketball and tennis at Arroyo Grande. "But I'm so glad I was."</TE>
<TE>   Although Grant had never picked up a shot or discus until high
school, she won the Southern Section Division II discus title as a
freshman and just missed qualifying for the finals of the state
championships.</TE>
<TE>   She improved her best from 140-5 as a freshman to 155-8 last year
and placed fourth in the state meet after finishing second to
teammate Michelle Pequignot in the section's Division I final.</TE>
<TE>   The 155-8 remained her best until last week when her 164-6 effort
moved her to fifth on the all-time Southern Section performer list.</TE>
<TE>   "She's just starting to understand a little more what throwing the
discus is all about," Budke said of Grant, the seventh-ranked
shotputter in the state with a season best of 42-41/2. "She's
starting to understand that she has to hit certain positions [during
the throw] if she wants to throw to her capability."</TE>
<TE>   Low-key approach: High jumper Kaylene Wagner of Goleta Dos Pueblos
has been on a roll this season with a victory in the L.A.
Invitational indoor meet at the Sports Arena on Feb. 23, a runner-up
finish in the National Scholastic Indoor Championships in New York
City on March 8 and a career-best jump of 5-10 to win the Camarillo
Invitational on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But don't expect the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo-bound senior to make
any bold predictions about the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I take every meet day by day," said Wagner, sixth in the state
championships last year. "I just try and do my best on that
particular day."</TE>
<TE>   She wants to break the school record of 5-101/2 set by Denise
Yamada in 1983 and clearing 6 feet would be "absolutely wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping things in perspective: Junior David Shipp of Valencia
upset some high-quality quarter-milers Saturday when he won the 400
meters in the Northridge-Alemany Relays at Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   But Coach Mike Pontius realizes that the Southern Section
championships are two months away.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good race for David," Pontius said. "But it's still the
middle of March and nothing is won in the middle of March."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-2, 195-pound Shipp, a defensive end in football, had a
best of 50.41 entering the Northridge-Alemany Relays. But his 49.62
clocking in cool and breezy conditions gave him a victory over
second-place Justin Tryon of Woodland Hills Taft, third-place Jarvis
Littleton of Compton Dominguez and fourth-place Tyrone Melton of
Taft.</TE>
<TE>   Tryon ran 48.02 last season while Littleton clocked 48.55 and
Melton had a hand-timed 48.8.</TE>

<HD>Redondo Learns Five Is Greater Than One</HD>
<DH>Girls' basketball: Drive to state title game was spurred
when injury to star player forced Sea Hawks to come together.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ofa Tulikihihifo was considered the best player on the Redondo Union
girls' basketball team, so when she tore ligaments in her right knee
last June, it was a tremendous loss.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, when the Sea Hawks step on the Arco Arena floor against
Stockton St. Mary's on Friday, trying to win their first state
championship, the flash point of their success can be traced to
Tulikihihifo's injury.</LD>
<LD>   A team that relied on Tulikihihifo to score and rebound had to
learn to fend for itself.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a great motivator, but it was a horrible thing that
happened to her," said Brittany Grice, a junior forward. "We've had
to step up. We knew she could help us when she got back."</TE>
<TE>   That is exactly what happened. Redondo won four summer
tournaments, then struggled in some tough early-season tournaments
and started with a 5-6 record. The Sea Hawks (26-7) then won 21 of 22
games, beginning Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of Tulikihihifo, a 5-9 senior forward, is as
emotional as it is physical. She is a force, but now not the only
force. She didn't start playing significant minutes until late
January. She's not 100%, but she's close enough to be taken
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to be healthy," Coach Marcello Enriquez said. "We
average more points and we're giving up less."</TE>
<TE>   Tulikihihifo is averaging 13 points and 9.8 rebounds, and Krista
Areyan, a 6-0 senior forward, is averaging 10.8 points and six
rebounds off the bench. The other four starters average between 7.2
and 8.4 points.</TE>
<TE>   "They have good balance," said Troy Coach Kevin Kiernan, whose
team lost to the Sea Hawks in the Southern California Regional final,
53-39. "They got used to playing without [Tulikihihifo], and their
big people developed, and now she's back."</TE>
<TE>   Tulikihihifo says she's about 90% of where she was before her
injury. Her rehabilitation is driven by two losses: In 2000, Redondo
beat Brea Olinda for the Southern Section title but lost to Brea in
the regional finals. Last year, Redondo lost to Pasadena Muir in the
Southern Section semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the worst feeling in my life," Tulikihihifo said.</TE>
<TE>   If Redondo wins the title, it will do so with defense. The 39
points scored by Troy was the most given up by the Sea Hawks in their
last four games.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who beats Ventura by 16 [50-34] in Ventura, that's not
just a bad shooting night," Kiernan said. "They're playing some good
defense."</TE>
<TE>   Only four times in the last 22 games has Redondo's opponent scored
more than 50 points, and none has scored more than 56. Redondo's last
loss was 12 games ago, 46-44 to Manhattan Beach Mira Costa.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not flashy, but that's how we get things done," Enriquez
said. "We've got five players [on the floor] who play as one, who
believe in the philosophy of working from the inside out, who are
patient.</TE>
<TE>   "We play great team defense. I honestly feel we're one of the best
defensive teams in the state."</TE>
<TE>   They have a chance to prove it Friday.</TE>

<HD>A Loss Trojans Want to Forget</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC has accomplished much in its 81-year baseball history but Tuesday
will rank among one of the Trojans' most embarrassing days.</LD>
<LD>   Loyola Marymount (9-16) dealt the visiting Trojans a 31-7 defeat
in a nonconference game. It was USC's worst loss and the 31 runs were
its most given up.</LD>
<LD>   The Lions scored 18 runs in their final two at-bats. Freshman
third baseman Jonathan Oller hit two three-run home runs in a 10-run
seventh inning. Loyola had 27 hits, drew eight walks and benefited
from the Trojans' five errors.</LD>
<TE>   "It was one of those days where [USC] walked a few people and that
kind of started it," Loyola Coach Frank Cruz said. "The last couple
of innings, it seemed like whatever our guys hit found a hole."</TE>
<TE>   USC used eight pitchers. Starter J.P. Howell gave up three runs
(one earned) in 21/3 innings, but relievers Jon Williams (four earned
runs), Chad Clark (six runs), Sam Ramirez (six runs) and Clayton
Wentworth (seven runs) had outings to forget. The Trojans had to
bring in Dale Legaspi, a little-used reserve infielder, to get the
final three outs.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish we had some valid alibi or excuse," USC Coach Mike
Gillespie said. "I really don't think that's the case. I don't recall

<HD>Freeman Weathers a GOP Attack</HD>
<DH>Politics: Appointment as chairman of state power authority
goes to Senate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- S. David Freeman, the energy expert recruited by Gov.
Gray Davis to keep the lights on during the California energy crisis
last year, survived a Republican attack Wednesday to win a major
victory in his fight for Senate confirmation as chairman of the
state's power authority.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans on the Senate Rules Committee suggested he mismanaged
the negotiation of billions of dollars' worth of power purchase
contracts, had "potential" conflicts of interest and for months
cloaked details of the contracts in secrecy.</LD>
<LD>   "I have no conflicts of interest," Freeman shot back at one point.
At another, he told the committee: "I've done what the law requires"
in reporting possible conflicts.</LD>
<TE>   "I like to think I have 76 years of ethical behavior behind me,"
the 76-year-old snapped at his chief GOP antagonist, Sen. Ross
Johnson of Irvine, the upper chamber's senior Republican.</TE>
<TE>   On a 3-2 party-line vote, the Democrat-controlled Rules Committee
approved Freeman's confirmation as the first chairman of the state's
new public power authority, formally known as the California Consumer
Power and Conservation Financing Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The committee also approved other directors of the authority's
board, including Sunne Wright McPeak, John R. Stevens and Donald
Vial, all Democrats. Unlike Freeman, who is paid $220,008 a year as
chairman, they receive no pay.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' nomination of Freeman and the others was sent to the full
Senate, where easy approval is expected.</TE>
<TE>   The power authority, created last year during the energy crisis,
is authorized to issue $5 billion in state bonds for projects that
encourage conservation, invest in renewable sources of electricity
and protect against blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   At the outset of the gubernatorial campaign last year, Republicans
launched an assault on Davis' leadership during the energy crisis,
charging that he first pretended it didn't exist and then mismanaged
the state's effort to overcome electricity shortages and
astronomically high power prices.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman, a folksy, Stetson-wearing native of Tennessee, has
managed some of the nation's biggest public power agencies, including
the Tennessee Valley Authority and the New York Power Authority. He
is credited with turning the once-anemic Los Angeles Department of
Power and Water into a successful operation.</TE>
<TE>   But he found himself a bull's-eye for Johnson and Sen. William
"Pete" Knight (R-Palmdale) at the committee hearing. On occasion,
Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), the committee chairman,
joined in with skeptical questions.</TE>
<TE>   Criticism of Freeman centers on whether the state's $43 billion in
contracts with power generators will end up costing Californians far
more than Davis and Freeman indicated.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is trying to renegotiate some of the agreements
and is seeking lower prices on others in proceedings before the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman conceded that with "20/20 hindsight" a year later, the
contracts should be renegotiated, but insisted that at the time, they
were the best the state could get from the power "gougers."</TE>
<TE>   "The bargaining power of those generators was the equivalent of a
gun [at the state's head]. They had us over a barrel," Freeman said.</TE>
<TE>   When the state locked up multiyear power contracts last winter,
the average contract price of roughly $70 per megawatt-hour was a
fraction of spot-market prices. But the situation reversed itself in
June when market prices plummeted to $30 per megawatt-hour and less.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Puts Dent in L.A. Gridlock</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Mayor says half of the city's 50 worst
intersections have been revamped, as promised.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, who made improving the city's
gridlocked traffic one of the centerpieces of his campaign, announced
Wednesday that he has fixed 25 of the city's worst intersections and
is working on another 25.</LD>
<LD>   The first round of improvements, which the mayor promised to
complete within a year, took eight months and involved adding
left-turn arrows, new traffic signals and "smart crosswalks" that
flash warning beacons when pedestrians step off the curb.</LD>
<LD>   Another 25 intersections around the city will get similar
improvements, along with better visibility, Hahn said.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled to say that we're keeping Los Angeles moving," said
the mayor, straining to be heard over the roar of traffic behind him
on Victory Boulevard, which has a new left-turn signal.</TE>
<TE>   "I got kidded a little bit in the campaign when I said I wanted to
put in more left-turn lanes and left-turn signals," he added. "But
you know, if you drive in L.A., that's something that you need."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has been trying to highlight initiatives to improve city
services as he fights movements in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood
and the harbor area to break away from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Both rounds of intersection improvements will cost about $2
million altogether, and were accomplished by moving up some planned
projects and reassigning city engineers who were working on other
projects.</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood resident Garrett Duenes said he has noticed a
change since the city added a left-turn arrow at the intersection of
Saticoy Street and Whitsett Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "That helped a lot," said Duenes, 26. "Everyone was running [the
light] before. There was a lot of illegality going on."</TE>

<HD>SEIU Chief Survives 3rd Ouster Try</HD>
<DH>Labor: Board vote of the union representing public
employees comes close to removing Barry Hammitt. Need for new
direction is cited as a reason for the action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chief of Ventura County's largest labor union narrowly survived a
move Tuesday to fire him, the third ouster attempt in 28 years.</LD>
<LD>   Board members representing about 4,000 county and city workers in
Service Employees International Union Local 998 gave Executive
Director Barry Hammitt a 29-17 vote of no confidence, three votes shy
of the two-thirds majority needed to terminate his contract.</LD>
<LD>   Union President Keith Filegar declined to discuss specific
complaints against Hammitt, saying only, "There was a feeling that
the union was not moving in the direction we thought it should be
moving."</LD>
<TE>   Hammitt, who has led the union since 1974, said he considers such
upheaval part of running a diverse and sometimes emotionally charged
organization. Union members also tried to oust him in 1978 and 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "I think these exercises are healthy because it causes us to
refocus on what our objectives are," Hammitt said. "I'm pretty upbeat
about the thing and am pressing on."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hammitt said he intends to hire a facilitator for an April
goal-setting retreat that would include staff and the union's board
members.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is for the group to hash out frustrations and identify a
direction the union will take.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see it as an insurmountable task," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Union members said complaints among the organization's staff of 12
have been brewing for at least two years.</TE>
<TE>   Salary Battle Had Been Acrimonious</TE>
<TE>   The board's vote Tuesday came just six months after the union
ended its most acrimonious salary battle with Ventura County leaders
in a decade, which ultimately resulted in raises averaging 13% over
four years for 4,200 general government workers.</TE>
<TE>   Hammitt, who earns about $115,000 a year, was chief negotiator.</TE>
<TE>   But the contract, approved by the union in September, did not
include a provision for retroactive cost-of-living retirement
increases. The decades of back payments were a sticking point that
prompted hundreds of frustrated librarians, social workers,
accountants and clerks to strike for eight days in July.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer's strike was a testament to a more active membership
that is demanding better service from the union's staff, Filegar
said.</TE>
<TE>   Members pay about $400 a year in dues for direct union services
such as representation in incidents of discipline or termination.
They also receive indirect services that include negotiating
salaries, endorsing candidates for public office and supporting
issues such as living-wage laws in cities and the county.</TE>
<TE>   Board Member Praises Director</TE>
<TE>   Steve Wood, a senior planner with the county and former union
president, voted against the motion to oust Hammitt.</TE>
<TE>   The director is doing "a very good job," Wood said. "He doesn't
take unilateral action. He always goes to the board for
authorization."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Hammitt's opponents said they hope the vote sends a
message that a majority of members are ready for a change in the
status quo.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [Tuesday] night could be used as a good catharsis," said
Patricia Foster, who is in charge of circulation at Foster Library in
Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   "Having gotten some issues out into the open, my hope is we will
go forward and ... have the union continue to grow," she said.</TE>

<HD>Day Laborers Get New Hiring Site</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: The city, acting on neighbors' complaints,
approves funds for a Royal Oaks Drive locale. Some residents are
still wary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laborer Juan Sinaloa is among the dozens of men who gather daily on a
corner in the Old Towne section of Thousand Oaks looking for work.</LD>
<LD>   "You can find a job here if you're a good worker," said Sinaloa,
25, who has come to this spot for the past year to pick up general
construction jobs.</LD>
<LD>   But neighbors prefer that Sinaloa and other laborers find another
spot to seek employment. They say the crowds that gather at Fairview
Road and Crescent Way are a nuisance and block traffic.</LD>
<TE>   Bowing to their complaints, the Thousand Oaks City Council on
Tuesday approved spending up to $50,000 to establish a job-hiring
site about two blocks south, along Royal Oaks Drive next to the
Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for improved landscaping, picnic tables, bike racks, a
portable toilet and a circular driveway so contractors and other
prospective employers don't slow traffic when they stop to pick up
workers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good decision to move there," said Sinaloa, who makes
about $80 a day and has worked steady this month to help remodel a
home in Newbury Park.</TE>
<TE>   'This Is Not a Band-Aid Solution'</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Manager Scott Mitnick said the city studied the
day-laborer situation for nearly 18 months and analyzed 14 possible
sites to relocate the workers from the intersection where they have
congregated since the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a Band-Aid solution, it's a long-term solution," said
Mitnick, adding that improvements at the new job site should be
completed by July. "Our goal is to resolve this neighborhood
situation."</TE>
<TE>   As part of its review, Thousand Oaks hired City Impact, a
nonprofit family counseling and youth mentoring agency in Oxnard, to
survey the mostly male laborers.</TE>
<TE>   The survey showed 78% of the laborers are under age 35, 46% are
married, 93% are local residents and nearly all would be willing to
move to a more suitable site.</TE>
<TE>   Mitnick said the city will ensure the refurbished site is
maintained, trash is picked up regularly and that police monitor any
possible traffic congestion.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a site that the community will be proud of," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But neighbors such as 81-year-old Gerda Miller, whose
three-bedroom home overlooks the greenbelt where the new jobs site
will be built, aren't convinced.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care how nice they think they're going to make it, it's
going to be a mess," said the retired bird breeder who has lived on
Royal Oaks Drive for nearly three decades.</TE>
<TE>   She said there have already been problems with transients sleeping
in a culvert between the greenbelt and the freeway, and that moving
day laborers to the area won't help.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have anything against these men," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have them pretty close. I don't think we should have them any
closer."</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter Says Laborers Respect the Merchants</TE>
<TE>   Although laborers gather across the street from the rear exit of
the dental office she manages, Valerie Emerson said they don't cause
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never had a problem with them at all," she said. "They're
out there trying to find a job. They're not out there to loiter."</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter Antonio Romero, who has come to the corner since 1995,
said the laborers respect the merchants and residents and would
rather not tie up the intersection while seeking a day's work.</TE>

<HD>This Change Benefiting Schoeneweis</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MESA, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Scott Schoeneweis finally feels confident enough to make a change.
And to throw one.</LD>
<LD>   After two full seasons with the Angels, the 28-year-old
left-hander recognized he needed more than a strong sinker to be
successful. Schoeneweis has worked diligently this spring at
incorporating a changeup into his repertoire.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not great, but it's functional and something I can now throw
consistently and comfortably," Schoeneweis said.</LD>
<TE>   It looked that way Wednesday, a day off for the rest of the Angels
but a work day for Schoeneweis, who took his regular fifth-day turn
against a team of Milwaukee Brewer triple-A players at the Angels'
minor league complex. Schoeneweis pitched five scoreless innings,
gave up six hits, struck out two and did not issue a walk.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I threw 21 changeups today," said Schoeneweis, who threw
81 pitches. "That's a record for me."</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis finished with a 10-11 record and a 5.08 earned-run
average in 2051/3 innings last season and tied for the team lead with
32 starts. It was an improvement over the 7-10 record and 5.45 ERA he
posted in 2000, but opposing hitters did not have to guess much when
facing him.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only get by on newness and guys not knowing you for so
long," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis has given up four runs and 13 hits in 10 innings
against major league teams this spring. It's the first time he has
felt comfortable enough to experiment without worrying about being
sent down if he failed.</TE>
<TE>   "The last three springs I've come in and was trying to make the
squad," Schoeneweis said. "If I had been giving up hits with
changeups, that would not have helped me in having them say, 'We need
to keep this guy.'"</TE>
<TE>   Angel pitching coach Bud Black said Schoeneweis was smart to rely
on his sinker during his first seasons in the majors because, "You
dance with who brought you." Now, it's time to take the next step.</TE>
<TE>   "I went through the same process," said Black, who pitched for 15
years in the major leagues. "I was a two-pitch pitcher when I came
up. Over time, you have to develop new pitches to get major league
hitters out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Adam Kennedy has gone 18 for 38 with two home runs
and has driven in 13 runs.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy is intent on remaining in the lineup and showing Angel
Manager Mike Scioscia that he can hit left-handers as well as
right-handers and provide solid defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be on the field every day, especially at this point,"
said Kennedy, a left-handed hitter who last season batted .270 with
six homers and 40 runs batted in 478 at-bats. "I have things to iron
out offensively and defensively. The way you do that is by being out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia has been impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to come into spring training with a mind-set of winning
a job," Scioscia said. "You have to keep your edge. Adam is doing
that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Troy Glaus is expected to be in the lineup today
against the Colorado Rockies after sitting out five games because of
a strained abdominal muscle. Left-hander Jarrod Washburn will start
for the Angels.</TE>

<HD>Longer Course Shortens Odds on Tiger</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If the course changes at Augusta National really were meant to
prevent his son from winning the Masters, Earl Woods said they got it
all wrong. "If they wanted to Tiger-proof it, there is a way," Earl
Woods said. "Use the ladies' tees, eliminate all the rough, put the
pins in the easiest locations and widen the fairways. That brings
everybody in the field into the tournament and I guarantee you Tiger
wouldn't win."</LD>
<LD>   The elder Woods says he mentioned his idea to Hootie Johnson,
chairman of Augusta National, at last year's championship dinner
after the tournament ... which Tiger won, by the way, for the second
time. Johnson has said the changes were made to keep Augusta National
up to date with the advancements in golf equipment technology.</LD>
<LD>   Alterations have been made at seven of Augusta National's par-four
holes and two par-five holes, including such changes as adding nearly
300 yards in all, reshaping bunkers, moving tees, planting trees,
grading landing areas and re-grassing greens. In the final analysis,
the changes make it easier, not harder, for Woods to win, according
to his father.</LD>
<TE>   "What this does is eliminate half the field," Earl Woods said.
"More than half. What are you going to do? Look at the 18th. Uphill,
into the wind, 465 yards. What is poor little Fred Funk going to do
on the tee box?</TE>
<TE>   "If they had gone with my suggestion, everybody gets to the
par-fives in two and you've got guys with radar on their wedge shots,
like Billy Mayfair and Funk."</TE>
<TE>   According to Earl Woods, the top players in the world are all long
hitters and he expects the Masters champion to come from this group:
Tiger, Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els, David Duval and Vijay Singh. He
also gave John Daly an outside chance.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only are they long, but they have short games and they can
putt," he said. "Sure, some have brains between their ears and can
manage their games better than others. I'm not going to mention any
names."</TE>
<TE>   As for his son, Earl Woods says Tiger is "getting there" and needs
to fine-tune his putting, but also his iron play in order to give
himself some makable putts.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, he just matured last year. All of a sudden, you don't
have those shots that go clear over the green and you say 'Where did
that come from?' Because you're maturing. Distance control brought on
by maturity and when he has that, he's going to be absolutely
incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Play With Tiger</TE>
<TE>   How much does it cost to play a round of golf with Tiger?
"Worldwide, it's off the chart," Earl said.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Woods has gotten together with Ebay to set up an
auction, April 4-14, for a round of golf with Woods. The outing will
be scheduled later and held at Tiger's home course at Isleworth
Country Club in Windermere, Fla. The event benefits the Tiger Woods
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Slump News</TE>
<TE>   Isn't it funny how perceptions change? Woods waited until the
middle of March to win his first tournament of the year, and now his
sense of timing looks impeccable.</TE>
<TE>   In case you're keeping score at home, Woods is the defending
champion in five of the six tournaments he has played or will
play--he won last week at Bay Hill, won last year at the Players
Championship and at the Masters, tied for third at the Byron Nelson,
won the Deutsche Bank/SAP Open and won the Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Is This Harsh?</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson had a two-shot lead on the last day at Bay Hill but
bogeyed four of the last five holes and ended up five shots behind
Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, that failed to impress Ron Sirak of Golfdigest.com.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Sirak: "This guy can find more ways to lose than the 1962
New York Mets and he has more excuses than an Enron executive."</TE>
<TE>   Or Is This?</TE>
<TE>   From Gary Smits of the Florida Times-Union, commenting on the
constantly heckled Colin Montgomerie, returning to the U.S. this week
at the Players Championship. Wrote Smits: "Monty has ears that can
pick up a dog whistle from three fairways away."</TE>
<TE>   Runyan: 1908-2002</TE>
<TE>   Paul Runyan's death Sunday at 93 was correctly called the end of
an era because Runyan passed some of golf's earliest signposts and
traveled smartly with contemporaries that included Walter Hagen, Gene
Sarazen and Sam Snead.</TE>
<TE>   Born the son of a dairy farmer in Hot Springs, Ark., Runyan was on
the Ryder Cup team in 1933, only the fourth time it was played.</TE>
<TE>   At 25, he was an assistant to club pro Craig Wood at Forest Hills
in White Plains, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   In 1934, Runyan beat Wood for the first of his two PGA
Championships.</TE>
<TE>   Runyan also played in the first Masters, 68 years ago, finishing
third behind winner Horton Smith and Wood. Runyan's death means there
is only one living player from the 1934 Masters, 88-year-old Charlie
Yates, a boyhood friend of Bobby Jones.</TE>

<HD>On Field, There Has Been Little Spring in Their Step</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>All the focus on the surgically repaired elbows of Kevin Brown and
Andy Ashby, the success and struggles of Kazuhisa Ishii and the
competition for the center field, shortstop and fifth rotation jobs
have obscured this not-so-minor detail: The Dodgers have played
poorly this spring.</LD>
<LD>   Right fielder Shawn Green is batting .103 (three for 29), second
baseman Mark Grudzielanek is hitless in 14 spring at-bats and has not
fully recovered from a sore right hamstring, Eric Karros is batting
.216, and Adrian Beltre is hitting .167 after Wednesday's 12-3
exhibition loss to Houston.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers (6-12) are batting .237 and have committed 29 errors
in 21 games. No player has stepped up and seized the center-field or
leadoff spots. Brown and Ashby have shown little consistency, Ishii's
last outing, in which he gave up six runs, has raised questions, and
Matt Herges, a closer candidate, has been rocked for eight earned
runs on 18 hits in eight innings.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a point when we need to start picking it up, start
gaining some momentum," catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "We're making too
many errors, too many stupid errors, and that has to stop, no matter
when you're playing."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy is not about to panic. "The one thing about
spring training," he said, "is that when the last game is played, you
can forget everything."</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Jordan said it's difficult getting excited for
exhibition games.</TE>
<TE>   "But once the season starts and that light switch goes on, you get
pumped up and the adrenaline starts flowing," he said. "Spring
training doesn't mean a thing. It's all about seeing pitches and
preparing yourself mentally."</TE>
<TE>   Reserve outfielder Dante Bichette, concerned about his dwindling
chances of making the team, is contemplating a request to be
released, but he put off a decision after speaking with Tracy and
General Manager Dan Evans.</TE>
<TE>   Bichette, a career .299 hitter with 274 home runs in 14 seasons,
was thought to be a lock to make the team, but he's batting .179
(seven for 39) in 15 games. Tracy said he "wasn't 100% convinced
Bichette is on this club," and questioned whether Bichette, who has
never had fewer than 349 at-bats a season since 1990, would accept a
pinch-hitting role.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're looking for is completely different than what he's
accustomed to," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Bichette's perception of his play--as well as his potential
role--seem to differ from that of the Dodgers. "I've done everything
I can do," Bichette, 38, said. "The hits haven't been falling, but my
bat speed is still there. I've played good defense. I do know this,
there's no doubt in my mind I can be a productive player, no matter
what I hit in spring training."</TE>
<TE>   Bichette admitted, however, that he might have problems adjusting
to a lesser role. When he signed a minor league contract on Jan. 30,
Bichette hoped he would see significant time in the outfield and get
around 400 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "I question whether I can handle that [pinch-hitting] role,"
Bichette said. "The key is having enough at-bats to where you don't
feel you're coming in out of the blue. It's not an easy role. It's
something you've got to really want to do."</TE>
<TE>   Bichette and Evans declined to discuss the details of their
meeting. A clause in Bichette's contract requires him to be on the
major league roster by April 1 or released with $75,000 in
termination play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers optioned pitcher Jeff Williams to triple-A Las Vegas
on Wednesday, and outfielder Mark Whiten was assigned to minor league
camp.</TE>

<LD>Tiger Woods was on the golf course at dawn Wednesday, and not
entirely pleased with what he saw.</LD>
<LD>   The fairways were soft and wet. His ball picked up mud along the
fairways. He dug deep to repair pitch marks on the green. The Stadium
Course on the TPC at Sawgrass hardly resembled what Ernie Els
referred to as a "little monster."</LD>
<LD>   "It's better when it's firm and fast," Woods said as he walked to
the third green. "That's what really separates guys out here. Because
you really have to think."</LD>
<TE>   Woods likes a tough test, and that's what the Players
Championship, which begins today, is all about.</TE>
<TE>   They call it the fifth major, and in some cases it is even tougher
to win than the four majors that make up the Grand Slam.</TE>
<TE>   All but four winners in the 28-year history of the Players
Championship have also won a major, which is no coincidence. No one
has won consecutive titles.</TE>
<TE>   The field is the deepest and strongest in golf, with 48 of the top
50 from the world ranking. The course features the most difficult
closing holes in golf--an island green for a par three, followed by
the 447-yard 18th, which played harder than any other hole on tour
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to scuffle it around here and shoot a good
score," Els said. "You've got to play well to score well."</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, no one is playing better than Woods and Els.</TE>
<TE>   Els won tournaments in Miami and Dubai, then tied for ninth last
week at Bay Hill.</TE>
<TE>   He is so locked into his game that he had the presence Wednesday
to stop his practice round after nine holes and head to the range
when he felt out of sync.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the advantage goes to Woods, whose game appears to be
coming together.</TE>
<TE>   He won at Bay Hill last week for his first victory of the season,
the only player in contention to avoid bogey over the final nine
holes on brick-hard greens.</TE>
<TE>   He is the defending champion at Sawgrass, where last year he
closed with a 67 over two days--nine on Sunday because of rain, nine
on Monday under sunny skies.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you win on a golf course, you're going to have that
confidence when you go back," Woods said.</TE>

<LD>Santa Anita isn't the only place offering 2-year-old racing.</LD>
<LD>   The Arcadia track will have its second two-furlong race of the
meet for California-bred babies this afternoon after Gulfstream Park
has its first contest of the season for 2-year-olds.</LD>
<LD>   The card in Florida will begin with a three-furlong sprint that
attracted seven youngsters.</LD>
<TE>   Sweet Promises, a son of End Sweep, probably will get most of the
support because his trainer (Larry Pilotti) does well with rookies
and with 2-year-olds. Sweet Promises will break from the rail and
will be ridden by Edgar Prado.</TE>
<TE>   The local 2-year-old race has a field of 10, including Hollywood
Honey, a Distinctive Cat filly who did not draw in from the
also-eligible list in Wednesday's first race.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Wesley Ward for a partnership, Hollywood Honey has
trained as if she can run some and the barn has done well with
youngsters. Tyler Baze will ride the filly, who worked in 22 1/5 from
the gate March 6 and also had 35 4/5 and 11 flat drills.</TE>
<TE>   A race after the 2-year-olds begin their careers, Sing Because, a
9-year-old, will try for his 14th lifetime victory. A gelded son of
Seattle Song, he has won seven of 19 at Santa Anita and is the 3-1
second choice to win for the first time in his third start for
trainer Eddie Truman.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Jeremy's Quest, who has won two in a row
impressively, will seek her first win on the turf in today's seventh
at about 61/2 furlongs. The Mr. Integrity filly will be making her
first start for trainer Bill Spawr, who claimed her for $20,000 out
of her victory Feb. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Dean Pederson. The trainer has won with 14 of his first
34 starters at Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Ed Plesa Jr. The trainer began the new week at
Gulfstream Park having lost with 70 of his 73 starters in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta using Jeremy's Quest on top to
High Bolly, Proud Tammie and Lady Evergreen in the two hole and all
in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 2/172. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $13.20/$1,010.60. Total money bet: $1,046.</TE>

<HD>BYU's Judkins Getting Noticed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Judkins was the guy drafted by the Boston Celtics in the second
round after they took Larry Bird. He spent 10 years as an assistant
to Rick Majerus at Utah.</LD>
<LD>   He's not in the background any longer. The first-year women's
coach at Brigham Young has taken the surprising Cougars to the third
round of the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm real happy," Judkins said Wednesday. "To be here in my first
year as a women's coach, I've been real blessed to have things bounce
my way."</LD>
<TE>   BYU (24-8) was 0-4 in the NCAA tournament until last weekend, when
the 11th-seeded Cougars beat Florida, 90-52, and then erased a
13-point second-half deficit to stun Iowa State, 75-69, on the
Cyclones' home court.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars had so much fun in Ames, Iowa, they're heading back
for the Midwest Regional semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Next up is Saturday's game against perennial national power
Tennessee (27-4).</TE>
<TE>   "You'd be stupid if you didn't realize this is a very awesome
program," said Judkins, or "Juddie" as his players call him.</TE>
<TE>   The giant-killer theme is nothing new to Judkins, who worked under
Majerus when the Runnin' Utes upset Arizona to reach the 1998 men's
Final Four, then beat North Carolina before losing in the title game
to Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   He compared the Tennessee matchup to Utah playing North Carolina
that year.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a great tradition. They put four guys in the NBA. Vince
Carter was one of them," Judkins said. "But we knew if we could play
our game, we could stay with them. That's something I'm going to
bring up to our team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION II</TE>
<TE>   Six players scored in double figures for Cal Poly Pomona as the
Broncos defeated Mars Hill, N.C., 88-69, in the quarterfinals of the
NCAA Division II tournament in Rochester, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   Lauri McIntosh led Pomona with 19 points and Heather Reeder had
12. Leah Whatley, Burgundie Porter, Marisa Lattin and Aprile Powell
finished with 10 points each.</TE>
<TE>   Pomona will play Glenville State (W.Va.) in the semifinals today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NIT</TE>
<TE>   In Wednesday's quarterfinals, Virginia Tech routed Vermont, 76-48;
Houston defeated Valparaiso, 61-53, and Oregon beat Washington,
77-73.</TE>
<TE>   In next week's semifinals, Virginia Tech will face Houston and
Oregon will play Michigan State.</TE>

<LD>The attorney for a Santa Rosa Valley woman convicted last year of
murdering her three young sons has requested a new trial based on
claims of juror misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   Socorro Caro, 44, faces the death penalty during her sentencing
next week. After convicting Caro in November, the same Ventura County
jury recommended that she be executed.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Donald D. Coleman will ultimately decide
between a death sentence and life in prison for Caro, but first must
consider the motion for a new trial. Both matters will be heard
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "The jurors in this case committed several acts of misconduct,"
according to Deputy Public Defender Jean Farley's motion.</TE>
<TE>   It states that the misconduct was "frequent, mean-spirited,
intimidating and designed to foster a framework conducive to a
verdict of guilt and death." During the trial, Coleman repeatedly

<DL></DL>
<LD>The attorney for a Santa Rosa Valley woman convicted last year of
murdering her three young sons has requested a new trial based on
claims of juror misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   Socorro Caro, 44, faces the death penalty during her sentencing
next week. After convicting Caro in November, the same jury
recommended that she be executed.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Donald D. Coleman will ultimately decide
between a death sentence and life in prison for Caro, but first must
consider the motion for a new trial, which is standard in such cases.
Both matters will be heard Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "The jurors in this case committed several acts of misconduct,"
according to Deputy Public Defender Jean Farley's motion.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the misconduct was "frequent, mean-spirited,
intimidating and designed to foster a framework conducive to a
verdict of guilt and death," states the motion, which was filed last
week.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Coleman repeatedly ordered jurors not to discuss
the case outside court.</TE>
<TE>   Included in Farley's motion are sworn affidavits from C. Anthony
Anderson, a juror who was dismissed during deliberations, and Brian
Kehoe, an alternate juror.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson alleges that a fellow juror told him outside the
courtroom that defense attorneys "knew their client was guilty" and
were "running around" to find evidence to prove Caro was "crazy."</TE>
<TE>   In his affidavit, Anderson also says he was accused by another
juror of holding out against a guilty verdict in order to become
famous and "get a date with Ms. Farley."</TE>
<TE>   Kehoe alleges in his affidavit that jurors repeatedly violated
Coleman's admonishments and that at least one juror "often made
disparaging and derogatory comments about defense counsel." On at
least two occasions, the same juror said she wanted to "hit Farley
upside her head."</TE>
<TE>   The improper discussions about the case were so numerous,
according to Kehoe's statement, that he was "unable to recall all of
the occasions."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Farley nor the prosecutor in the case were immediately
available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Caro shot three of her four sons as they slept the night of Nov.
22, 1999, before shooting herself in the head. The youngest son, who
was 13 months old, was unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that Caro was using the boys--11-year-old
Joey, 8-year-old Michael and 5-year-old Christopher--to punish her
husband, Dr. Xavier Caro, for restricting her funds and planning to
divorce her.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys unsuccessfully claimed that Xavier Caro, a
Northridge rheumatologist, killed the boys and then shot his wife in
the head to make it appear as if she had attempted suicide.</TE>

<HD>Vietnamese Voters Fault Sample Ballot</HD>
<DH>Election: In a letter to the registrar, a group says bad
translations made the guide confusing. Official cites printing error
as root of problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's voting instructions may have caused confusion among
Vietnamese-speaking voters in the March 5 primary because of poor
English-to-Vietnamese translations in the sample ballot, according to
a Vietnamese American coalition.</LD>
<LD>   The translations used nontraditional idioms and were so vague that
it made election documents nearly impossible to understand, said
Chuyen V. Nguyen, director of the Vietnamese American Voters
Coalition.</LD>
<LD>   The coalition, a loosely knit group of business and community
leaders, sent a letter of complaint to Registrar of Voters Rosalyn
Lever last week.</LD>
<TE>   Registrar officials said the problem resulted when a printer in
Sacramento used the wrong computer software, making the page of
instructions on how to vote by absentee ballot undecipherable.</TE>
<TE>   "We caught the problem here at the registrar's. It was a wrong
computer font," said Steve Rodermund, chief deputy registrar.</TE>
<TE>   Rodermund said it was too late to order a reprint in time to
distribute corrected sample ballots before the election. Instead,
election workers correctly translated the page, printed it and
inserted into the sample ballot, which was then mailed to about
24,400 voters who had requested a Vietnamese-language ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "It included a blurb on the back to disregard the wrongly worded
page," Rodermund said.</TE>
<TE>   Election officials said they did not immediately know whether the
error resulted in problems for voters. Coalition members believe it
did and said they hope that the error isn't repeated for the November
election.</TE>
<TE>   Another complaint in the coalition's letter involves a Vietnamese
American Democrat who accidentally voted using a Republican ballot he
was given at his polling place.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible he went to a polling place and got the wrong
ballot," Rodermund said, but he added that the registrar's office can
verify only whether the voter did or did not vote at the polling
place. The voter also has to assume some responsibility, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Other Printing Errors Found in Voter Guides</TE>
<TE>   Printing errors plagued election officials this year. In addition
to the translation problem, more than 140,000 sample ballot pamphlets
were printed incorrectly for the Orange County Board of Supervisors
race between incumbent Cynthia P. Coad and challenger Chris Norby, a
Fullerton City Council member and the eventual winner.</TE>
<TE>   Coad's and Norby's names were reversed on the ballot, giving Norby
a slight edge because his name appeared first, said Coad campaign
officials. Incumbents traditionally are listed first.</TE>
<TE>   A printer's error also caused the fiscal analysis for Measure W,
the initiative that changed the zoning of the closed El Toro Marine
base from an airport to a large urban park, to be omitted from about
48,000 voter pamphlets mailed to South County residents.</TE>
<TE>   Also, three congressional candidates in the 44th District were
wrongly listed in the sample ballot.</TE>

<HD>Bishop Urges Improved Latino Ties</HD>
<DH>Immigration: Catholic leader asks Anaheim council to ease
tensions over deportations.</DH>

<LD>Flanked by members of his largely immigrant and Spanish-speaking
parish, Auxiliary Bishop Jaime Soto called on Anaheim officials and
police Wednesday to repair a relationship that he said is "fraught
with tension, distrust and adversarial spirit."</LD>
<LD>   Latino leaders and immigrant advocates in Anaheim have been
speaking out for more than a year, holding news conferences and City
Hall protests to criticize tension between police and Latinos.</LD>
<LD>   Their most pressing concern has been a program that stations a
federal immigration agent at the city jail--a program that activists
say has resulted in the deportation of illegal immigrants after minor
crimes and traffic violations.</LD>
<TE>   In many cases, illegal immigrants were jailed when they could not
present a valid form of identification or a driver's license. INS
agents determined residency status while the suspects were in jail.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Soto, of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange, said
police relations have slipped so far that some of his parishioners
are afraid to report crimes or seek help from law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "When a program is undermining the central trust people need to
have in police, then we create an equally dangerous situation," Soto
said.</TE>
<TE>   Soto will ask Anaheim council members to meet individually with
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "The immigrant community feels out of touch with the City
Council," Soto said.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim police and Mayor Tom Daly, who have both met with church
officials and attended community meetings, referred calls to city
spokesman John Nicoletti.</TE>
<TE>   The city has repeatedly stated that the INS presence--though
supported by Anaheim leaders--is a federal issue. INS agents are also
stationed at the Costa Mesa and Fullerton jails and Orange County
Jail, though those places have not been targeted by protesters.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a little confused," Nicoletti said. "We don't understand
why Auxiliary Bishop Soto has chosen Anaheim. The INS deports people.
The city of Anaheim is not in the business of certifying
citizenship."</TE>
<TE>   Nicoletti said the city is disappointed that Soto and the Orange
County Congregation Community Organization, which represents 12
churches in the county, are misleading their members.</TE>
<TE>   He cited several efforts by the city to meet with Latino and
church leaders, as well as a decision last fall by Orange County law
enforcement agencies to accept Mexican identification cards.</TE>
<TE>   That decision means that people stopped for minor infractions
would no longer be taken to jail for lack of an ID. So far, though,
many illegal immigrants are still in the process of obtaining the ID.</TE>

<HD>Soto Urges Anaheim to Restore the Trust of Latino Residents</HD>

<LD>Flanked by members of his largely immigrant and Spanish-speaking

<LD>   Latino leaders and immigrant advocates in Anaheim have been

police relations have slipped so far that some of his parishioners
are afraid to report crimes or seek help from law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "When a program is undermining the central trust people need to

<TE>   Soto will ask Anaheim council members to meet individually with

<TE>   "The immigrant community feels out of touch with the City

<TE>   Anaheim police and Mayor Tom Daly, who have both met with church
officials and attended community meetings, referred calls to city
spokesman John Nicoletti.</TE>
<TE>   The city has repeatedly stated that the INS presence--though
supported by Anaheim leaders--is a federal issue. INS agents are also
stationed at the Costa Mesa and Fullerton jails and Orange County
Jail, though those places have not been targeted by protesters.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a little confused," Nicoletti said. "We don't understand
why Auxiliary Bishop Soto has chosen Anaheim. The INS deports people.
The city of Anaheim is not in the business of certifying

<TE>   Nicoletti said the city is disappointed that Soto and the Orange

<TE>   He cited several efforts by the city to meet with Latino and

enforcement agencies to accept Mexican identification cards.</TE>
<TE>   That decision means that people stopped for minor infractions
would no longer be taken to jail for lack of an ID. So far, though,
many illegal immigrants are still in the process of obtaining the ID.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Soto's concerns, Nicoletti said the program has appeared
effective. Since 1995, when the INS partnership began, crime in
Anaheim has dropped 36%. Since 1998, illegal immigrants have been
arrested for 60 rapes and sexual assaults, 384 domestic violence
cases, 542 burglaries and auto thefts, 531 drunken driving cases, and
849 drug cases.</TE>
<TE>   "Law-abiding residents are not being deported, and quite frankly
we're offended at the accusations," Nicoletti said.</TE>
<TE>   INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice said the immigration agents have a
federal mandate to remain at the jail.</TE>
<TE>   "Legislation passed by Congress requires us to have a presence at
county and local jails," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's press conference, many community members complained
that acceptance of the Mexican ID card is not enough to overcome
distrust of police.</TE>
<TE>   Several people said they drive illegally because they cannot
obtain a driver's license under federal law. Driving without a
license is considered serious enough to jail a violator with or
without identification.</TE>
<TE>   Guadalupe Millan said one of her relatives was deported last fall
after he failed to stop before making a right turn. He was driving
without a license, taken to the Anaheim jail and ultimately deported,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now every time I see a cop, I'm nervous," said Tomas Robledo, 32,
whose license expired but cannot be renewed without a Social Security
card.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're going to stop me and take me back. We need
driver's licenses to work. I don't want the government's money. I can
make my own. Just give me a chance."</TE>

<LD>Down the stretch they come....</LD>
<LD>   Where they'll finish is anyone's guess. With 14 games to play, the
Clippers are entrenched in ninth place in the Western Conference
standings, one position away from a playoff spot.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now, it doesn't matter how you play as long as you win,"
Coach Alvin Gentry said. "We have to understand the significance of
these games. We're into the teens now [14 games remaining]. If we
lose a game, we can't say, 'That's OK, we'll get them next week.'"</LD>
<TE>   Gentry has said all along that qualifying for the playoffs for the
first time since 1996-97 was the Clippers' top goal. But he also has
said from the start of the season that he won't be crushed if the
team fails to advance to the postseason. The Clippers have won four
more games than they did last season, when they topped their
1999-2000 total by 15 victories.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we play as hard as we have most of the year and as
long as we play unselfishly, I'll take whatever happens," Gentry said
earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' degree of difficulty has eased this week, what with
three games against sub-.500 teams in the Houston Rockets, Golden
State Warriors and Phoenix Suns.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have an easy game left on our schedule," Gentry said. "I
don't care what Golden State's record is. If we can't play hard, we
won't win. Golden State beat the Lakers and San Antonio [earlier this
season]. Any time you can run guys like Jason Richardson and some of
their big guys out there, you're going to have an opportunity to win.
We don't have the luxury of looking past anybody."</TE>
<TE>   For the record, the Warriors are last in the Pacific Division and
14th out of 15 teams in the Western Conference. They do lead the NBA
in rebounding, however.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers did not practice Wednesday but traveled early in the
morning to Oakland and hosted a luncheon with the team's sponsors at
a local seafood restaurant.</TE>

Oakland. Golden State has lost seven in a row, including a 110-93
defeat Tuesday against the Seattle SuperSonics. The Warriors also
have lost nine of 10 and 17 of 20 and have locked up last place in
the Pacific for the second consecutive season.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Flyers acquired veteran Adam Oates to patch their
center position after injuries to Jeremy Roenick and Keith Primeau.
Roenick is expected to be sidelined a month because of a knee injury.
Primeau is sidelined at least a week because of a rib injury. Oates
leads the NHL with 57 assists. Duck right wing Patric Kjellberg is
questionable because of a sore neck. The Ducks are coming off a 2-1
victory over Detroit on Tuesday, only their second victory in 18
games at Joe Louis Arena. Paul Kariya, who scored both goals against
the Red Wings, needs one more goal to reach 30 for the sixth time in
seven seasons. He had 17 goals in 1997-98, but played in only 22
games because of a contract squabble and concussion. The Ducks
rallied from a two-goal deficit to beat the Flyers, 5-4, on Feb. 6.
Kariya has four multi-goal games in the last 11 games.</TE>

<HD>Blake Trade Is Working Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would have been hard to imagine on the day the deal was struck,
but in the 91 games since the Kings traded all-star defenseman Rob
Blake to the Colorado Avalanche on Feb. 21, 2001, they are
47-24-14-6, 17 points better than they were in the 91 games before
they made the deal.</LD>
<LD>   Fearful of losing the former Norris Trophy winner without
compensation via unrestricted free agency last summer, the Kings sent
Blake and Steve Reinprecht to the Avalanche for Adam Deadmarsh, Aaron
Miller, prospect Jared Aulin and first-round picks in the 2001 and
2003 drafts. They used the first of the picks last summer to take
David Steckel of Ohio State.</LD>
<LD>   "It set the standard for all unrestricted-free-agency deals," King
Coach Andy Murray said. "It was an unbelievable trade, truly a
remarkable deal."</LD>
<TE>   Murray, however, won't say the Kings are better off without Blake,
who returns to Staples Center tonight for the second time since
helping the Avalanche win the Stanley Cup last June. The wild card in
the equation, Murray said, is goaltender Felix Potvin, who was
acquired from the Vancouver Canucks less than a week before Blake was
traded.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be difficult for me, out of respect for Rob, to ever say
we could be better without Rob," Murray said. "I think it has worked
out for both teams, but you'll never hear me say we're better without
Rob because he did so much for me.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he helped me get the job here, he was my captain with
Team Canada when we won the world championship [in 1997, two years
before Murray was hired by the Kings]. I would say Felix Potvin is
the difference, and we would have done as well with Rob as without
him. Felix came to us at the same time [as Deadmarsh and Miller] and
gave us consistency at that position."</TE>

<HD>Horry Is OK With Reserve Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Robert Horry came off the bench for the first time in a month
Wednesday, then said he assumed he was no longer a starter, which
didn't bother him at all.</LD>
<LD>   Samaki Walker, healed from a hyper-extended elbow, said he
believed his start was simply spot duty, long enough to defend San
Antonio forward Tim Duncan, and that that was fine.</LD>
<LD>   What is known is that Coach Phil Jackson desires a strong and
rested Horry by the playoffs, so playing Horry 41 minutes in
Tuesday's rout in Dallas was probably a mistake. After giving the
impression in previous seasons that he preferred to come off the
bench, Horry flourished as a starter since Feb. 17, two days after
Walker suffered his elbow injury.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's permanent, back to the old days," Horry said. "I'm
all right with that."</TE>
<TE>   Horry played only 17 minutes in a 108-90 Spur victory. He took one
shot, missed it, and had one rebound. By the time he entered the
game, with five minutes left in the first quarter, Duncan had six
points and the Spurs led by seven.</TE>
<TE>   Walker, who has shown steady improvement since coming to the
Lakers from the Spurs last summer, played 16 minutes, scored two
points and committed five fouls. He said the job is Horry's, if
Jackson so chooses.</TE>
<TE>   "It really doesn't matter one way or the other," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, Jackson's local Monday afternoon radio show is not at
all about the material gains. It's a public service.</TE>
<TE>   "With the misinformation most of the press deals with," Jackson
said, smiling, "it's better coming from the horse's mouth than
diluted and regurgitated."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On that theme, Jackson has become something of a mentor for Dallas
Maverick Coach Don Nelson, apparently.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said he had no problem with Jackson dragging Tuesday's
16-point blowout through near-endless fouls and timeouts at the end.
He simply hoped to learn something.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all good," Nelson said. "I'm a big fan of Phil's, what he's
done, being the greatest coach in the league for many years now.
Between he and Red Auerbach, you can flip a coin between who's the
greatest coach of all time. I actually copy and steal some of the
things he's done."</TE>

<HD>Jordan Inspires Wizards</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Jordan couldn't get into a rhythm in his first game back from
surgery on his right knee. Still, his presence on the court was more
than enough against the struggling Denver Nuggets.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan had only seven points in his earlier-than-expected return,
but Richard Hamilton scored 30 and the Washington Wizards routed the
Nuggets, 107-75, Wednesday night at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt pretty good and was moving well, but obviously my rhythm
wasn't quite there," said Jordan, who wore a protective sleeve on his
knee. "I felt good and the guys weren't looking for me, and they were
still being aggressive, which is what I wanted to happen anyway."</LD>
<TE>   Jordan, playing for the first time since having knee surgery Feb.
27, made two of his first four shots before missing five in a row. He
was the fifth player off the Wizard bench, marking the first time
since April 5, 1986, he played but was not in the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan was two for nine from the field with two assists, two
steals and a rebound in 16 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "His presence out there I think picks everyone's confidence up,"
said Washington's Courtney Alexander, who had 16 points. "We were all
excited to have him back in the lineup."</TE>
<TE>   Washington has won three of four after losing five in a row. The
Wizards are 21/2 games out of the final Eastern Conference playoff
spot.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuggets shot 33% and had 20 turnovers in losing their sixth in
a row.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 82, Philadelphia 77--Eddie House scored a season-high 20
points in a reserve role, including two free throws with 8.3 seconds
to play to clinch the victory at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson had 38 points for the 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an 11-0 record in the second of back-to-back games, the
victory wasn't sweet enough for Coach Pat Riley, who was still bitter
about the Heat's 91-79 loss to the 76ers on Tuesday night at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason, it always takes a humiliating loss to correct
things, and I have to do something about it," Riley said. "We just
don't take advantage when we have an edge."</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 97, Portland 82--Jason Kidd had 28 points, 11 assists
and eight rebounds and the Nets won their eighth in a row at home.</TE>
<TE>   Rasheed Wallace, who played only seven minutes in the first half
after picking up three fouls, led Portland with 17 points. The Trail
Blazers lost for the second time in 17 games.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a game where we could have easily had our doors blown
off and blamed it on last night," Kidd said. "This shows the
character of these guys. Through adversity we stepped up and answered
the call."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets were still smarting from a 100-97 loss to Cleveland on
Tuesday on a three-pointer by Lamond Murray with 0.5 seconds to play,
which they believe should have been waved off.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 94, Indiana 88--Baron Davis made a three-point play with
15 seconds to play at Charlotte, N.C., and the Hornets tightened the
Eastern Conference playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets, who won a season-high fourth consecutive game, moved
into a tie with the Pacers for the seventh playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   Davis had 25 points and 10 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 96, Cleveland 70--Paul Pierce had 22 points and 10
rebounds, scoring 11 during a 14-0 fourth-quarter run at Boston and
the Celtics swept the season series with the Cavaliers.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics went on a 21-2 run in the fourth quarter.</TE>

<HD>McKay Starts Paying Off for Stars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of the four players swapped by the Dallas Stars and New Jersey
Devils, Randy McKay had the least impressive offensive statistics.</LD>
<LD>   So, naturally, he was the first to come through with a big
offensive play Wednesday in Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   McKay had two assists in his Dallas debut, including a nifty
one-handed flick while his other arm was locked up by a defender that
Kirk Muller turned into the game-winner in the Stars' 3-2 victory
over the St. Louis Blues.</LD>
<TE>   "It just felt good to contribute," said McKay, who arrived in
Dallas a few hours before the game one day after being traded with
Jason Arnott for Joe Nieuwendyk and Jamie Langenbrunner. "It boosts
your confidence. You don't want to lose your first game with your new
team.</TE>
<TE>   "My ice time had diminished in New Jersey, so it's nice to at
least play and do something."</TE>
<TE>   Arnott didn't play because of a bad back that's bothered him for
more than a week. The Stars also were without Jere Lehtinen (ankle)
and Pierre Turgeon (back), leaving them down three of their most
skilled players in a game Dallas badly needed for playoff
positioning.</TE>
<TE>   "It's right there as far as big wins for us this year," Dallas
captain Derian Hatcher said. "After yesterday, and considering the
guys we had out, it was a great performance."</TE>
<TE>   The victory gives Dallas 78 points, good for eighth in the Western
Conference. The Stars are one point behind St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a frustrating game," Keith Tkachuk of the Blues said. "It
was the biggest game of the year and we didn't win."</TE>
<TE>   McKay came to the Stars with only seven assists and six goals in
55 games this season.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 3, Chicago 1--Playing the Blackhawks at Chicago
inspired the Devils to start strong.</TE>
<TE>   Colin White, John Madden and Bobby Holik scored and the Devils won
despite not having leading scorer Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora, who
were sidelined with flu.</TE>
<TE>   The Devils controlled play in the first period and early into the
second, building a 2-0 lead by 2:34.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey's early advantage could have been larger. The Devils
outshot the Blackhawks, 12-4, in the first period and had seven prime
scoring chances to none for Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   One of those came when New Jersey's Sergei Brylin was awarded a
penalty shot, but was stopped by Jocelyn Thibault just 4:14 in.</TE>
<TE>   "The first period was as good a period as you possibly could
play," said the Devils' John Vanbiesbrouck, who stopped 21 shots. "I
think we were hungry for the puck and moving the puck into their
end."</TE>
<TE>   The Devils have won four of their last five games.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 3, Minnesota 1--Playing for the first time since a young
fan died after being hit by a puck, the Blue Jackets rallied behind
Ron Tugnutt's 24 saves at St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   A moment of silence was held before the game for 13-year-old
Brittanie Cecil, who died Monday night after being hit by a puck
during Columbus' home game against Calgary on Saturday</TE>
<TE>   Espen Knutsen, whose shot was deflected by a defenseman and hit
the girl in the head, had her initials placed on his helmet along
with the rest of his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, Atlanta 2--Dave Andreychuk scored twice for the
Lightning during a four-goal second period at Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Andreychuk tied the score, 2-2, on a backhand while being pulled
down by Kamil Piros at 10:16. He scored the go-ahead goal from a
sharp angle near the goal line at 13:56.</TE>
<TE>   Andreychuk also had an assist and moved past Peter Stastny into
26th place on the all-time points list with 1,241. It was his first
multigoal game this season and 84th overall.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 4, Florida 1--Oleg Petrov and Richard Zednik scored, and
Doug Gilmour had three assists at Sunrise, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The game was the first for the Panthers since trading All-Star
Pavel Bure to the New York Rangers on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Zednik gave Montreal a 3-1 lead 58 seconds into the third period
with his 19th goal and Petrov capped the scoring at 6:09 with his
23rd.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 3, Pittsburgh 1--Ladislav Nagy and Daniel Briere scored in
the third period at Pittsburgh and the Coyotes earned at least a
point for the 12th time in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   It was Coach Bob Francis' 107th victory with the Coyotes, making
him the winningest coach in the franchise's combined history at
Winnipeg and Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 2, San Jose 1--Mike Comrie scored early in the third
period at Edmonton, Canada, giving the Oilers their third consecutive
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Comrie broke a 1-1 tie at 4:46 of the third period when he took a
pass from Anson Carter at the Sharks' blue line, broke in alone on
goalie Evgeni Nabokov and slid a backhander between the goalie's
legs.</TE>

<HD>Stokes Wants to Make His Point With Bruins</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Long Beach Poly High graduate yearned
to play at UCLA, but he's happy to be at Missouri.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Wesley Stokes is all about Long Beach. He grew up there and starred
at Long Beach Poly High, where he was a two-time honorable mention
All-American. His loyalty to his hometown is illustrated by the
tattoo on his left forearm that has "WESTSIDE" and "LONG BEACH"
surrounding a pair of hands cupping the Earth.</LD>
<LD>   After graduating from Poly, Stokes wanted to stay home and play at
UCLA, but when the Bruins began eyeing others, Stokes retreated and
went to Missouri.</LD>
<LD>   Is there any real wonder, then, that the Rastafarian-haired
sophomore point guard is carrying a bit of a grudge against the
Bruins into tonight's West Regional semifinal in San Jose?</LD>
<TE>   "It would mean a lot [to beat UCLA]," Stokes said. "They had first
opportunity, but they didn't take advantage of it ... so I want to
blow them out in the first half, not give them any breathing room."</TE>
<TE>   Stokes said that although he has made a happy home in Columbia,
Mo., there is a bitter taste in his mouth from the recruiting
experience with the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "They came after me at first but after they started looking at
another point guard, they stopped recruiting me," Stokes said. "They
stopped calling me and everything so I pretty much scratched them off
my list. And then they tried to start recruiting me again. But by
that time, if somebody recruits you and then stops, you're not going
to jump back on their bandwagon."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA has struggled with its point guard play all season and some
say the Bruins' loss was the Tigers' gain.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes was named to the Big 12's all-freshman team last season
after starting six games and averaging 8.6 points in conference play.
He struggled with confidence problems earlier this year, though, and
was benched in favor of senior Clarence Gilbert.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri Coach Quin Snyder said Stokes' accepting of his role as a
substitute has been "crucial" to the Tigers' late-season run.</TE>
<TE>   "Wesley's playing his best basketball of the year and he's a big
reason our team is where we are," Snyder said. "His ability to come
in and impact the game, by giving the ball up, by defending, Wesley's
voice is really strong on the court and Wesley's capable of leading
as well so it's really improved our leadership on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never an easy thing [to sit] and ... everybody wants to play
and I'm not naive enough to think that that wasn't hard for him. But
he's shown his character by how he's dealt with it and how he
continues to give himself to his teammates. I think he's found some
pride in his unselfishness and his mental toughness. I'm proud of him
for it."</TE>
<TE>   The 12th-seeded Tigers are 8-0 when Stokes, who has a 2.7-to-1
assists-to-turnover ratio in his last eight games, scores in double
figures. He's averaging 5.9 points with 4.1 assists.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming off the bench really doesn't matter as long as you get on
the floor and you get the opportunity," Stokes said. "</TE>
<TE>   He has no regrets of not responding to UCLA's overtures.</TE>
<TE>   "None whatsoever," Stokes said. "From Day One, when I signed that
contract to come to Missouri, I had forgotten all about UCLA. No
heads being hung so I'm just going to go out there and, hopefully,
knock them off."</TE>

<HD>Injury to Artery Caused Girl's Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>The 13-year-old girl hit by a puck at an NHL game died from a rare
injury to an artery that was damaged when her head snapped back, a
coroner said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Brittanie Cecil died Monday, two days after she was struck in the
forehead by the puck at a game between the Columbus Blue Jackets and
Calgary Flames.</LD>
<LD>   The damage to the artery, which runs from the spine to the back of
the brain, led to a "vicious cycle" of clotting in the artery and
swelling of the brain, said Franklin County Coroner Brad Lewis, who
performed the autopsy. He said the artery also might have been
slightly torn and her skull was fractured.</LD>
<TE>   Lewis said a fellow pathologist had not encountered a similar
injury and death in more than 25 years as a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   The eighth-grader was sitting about 15 rows above the ice and
behind the goal when the puck, six ounces of hard, frozen rubber,
came flying into the stands after Columbus center Espen Knutsen's
slap shot. The puck, which can travel over 100 mph on slap shots,
appeared to be deflected and hit two other fans near Cecil.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about it all the time," Knutsen told the St. Paul Pioneer
Press after a morning workout before the Columbus Blue Jackets' game
against Minnesota. "I think about her family because I have family
myself. It was just a horrible accident."</TE>
<TE>   The Wild held a moment of silence in Cecil's memory before the
game.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jackets will place Cecil's initials on their helmets and
the franchise also will promote a fund set up in her memory.</TE>

<HD>Irvine's Peirsol Sets World Record</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aaron Peirsol--being Aaron Peirsol--found a way to calm his nerves
before the final of the 200-meter backstroke at the Phillips 66
Spring National Championships Wednesday night at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   He talked. And talked some more.</LD>
<LD>   Then the 18-year-old from Irvine went out and seized the world
record in that event, finishing in 1 minute 55.15 seconds. The
previous record of 1:55.87 was set on Aug. 27, 1999, in Sydney by
Lenny Krayzelburg of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Peirsol, being Peirsol, gave some credit to two girls from Santa
Barbara, who spoke with him before his race.</TE>
<TE>   "They kept me calm," he said. "It was great. If I just sat there
the whole time, I would have been freaking out. I was talking,
laughing and it really helped a ton. It brings a lot of pressure off
you."</TE>
<TE>   Though he was a silver medalist in this event at the Sydney
Olympics (behind Krayzelburg) and a world champion last summer, this
accomplishment fulfilled a dream. His sister, Hayley, who finished
second in the 800 meters Tuesday, was there as was longtime coach
Dave Salo of the Irvine Novaquatics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sweet," said Peirsol, the Newport Harbor High senior who is
bound for Texas this fall. "I was extremely elated. It seemed like he
[Salo] was more elated than I was. He was crying. My sister was
crying. A couple of other people were crying. I think I was the only
one of the few that wasn't. I was too tired to cry."</TE>
<TE>   This was his first long-course swim at this distance since last
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Peirsol knew something special could happen when he went 1:57.19
in the morning preliminaries. His winning time at the World
Championships in July was 1:57.13.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of my best times ever," he said of the preliminary
race. "To do that, I really felt confident going into tonight. I was
more relaxed than I was this morning.... It's the smartest swim I
ever swam."</TE>

<HD>Jury Has Verdicts on 4 Counts in Mauling</HD>
<DH>Courts: Decisions are sealed to await final, fifth charge.
Deliberations will resume today.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Superior Court jury said Wednesday that it had reached verdicts on
four of five counts in the trial of two San Francisco lawyers charged
in their neighbor's fatal dog mauling.</LD>
<LD>   Judge James Warren ordered the verdicts sealed and told jurors to
continue deliberating on the fifth count today. All the verdicts will
be read at the same time, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "The court will retain this under lock and key tonight and it will
be available [Thursday]," Warren said.</LD>
<TE>   The defendants, Marjorie Knoller, 46, and her husband, Robert
Noel, 60, are charged with involuntary manslaughter and owning a
mischievous dog. Knoller is also charged with second-degree murder
and faces a sentence of 15 years to life in prison if convicted. Noel
faces four years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and Noel owned two large Presa Canario dogs that attacked
their neighbor Diane Whipple, a 33-year-old lacrosse coach, in the
hallway outside her San Francisco apartment on Jan. 26, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was moved to Los Angeles County Superior Court because
of publicity in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   After nearly 10 hours of deliberations over two days, the jury
foreman sent a note to the judge at 3:15 p.m. Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The jury has reached a decision on four of the five counts, and
we have determined that it would be best to adjourn and reconvene
tomorrow morning," the foreman wrote. During a brief court session,
Warren instructed the foreman to place the four verdict forms in an
envelope, seal it and sign his name across the back.</TE>
<TE>   The verdicts will not become final until they are read in court,
Warren said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge excused the panel of seven men and five women about 3:45
p.m., saying he was "aware that these deliberations can be trying."</TE>
<TE>   Warren encouraged them to keep an open mind and consider their
fellow jurors' points of view.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Terence Hallinan
said that he was encouraged that the jurors decided on all but one
count and that he believed they would reach a verdict on the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to speculate which count was undecided.</TE>
<TE>   "We're encouraged that this case will come to a conclusion,"
Hallinan said. "This is a case that must be put to rest."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys did not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors began their deliberations Tuesday after four weeks of
emotional testimony.</TE>
<TE>   The jury elected as foreman a Chicago native who works as a
machinist for the city of Los Angeles. The foreman, who had served on
two previous civil cases, has owned 10 dogs in his lifetime and has
been bitten once.</TE>
<TE>   Just after jurors reconvened at 9 a.m. Wednesday, they asked for a
rereading of testimony that Noel gave to the San Francisco grand jury
last year about his two dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Noel, who did not take the stand during the trial, denied to the
grand jury that either of his dogs had ever acted aggressively. He
also denied that one of the dogs had ever jumped at a pregnant woman
or had lunged and bared its teeth at a neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors were also read Noel's testimony about a dog walker who
warned him to muzzle his dogs.</TE>
<TE>   The three people referred to in the grand jury transcripts
testified in the trial about their encounters with the defendants and
their dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Warren also interrupted the deliberations Wednesday to clarify
jury instructions relating to the charge of owning a mischievous dog.</TE>

<HD>Panel OKs New Districts for L.A. School Board</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a bitter debate, the commission redrawing the Los Angeles Board
of Education's districts adopted a new map Wednesday night that
combines the southwest San Fernando Valley and West Los Angeles in
one district.</LD>
<LD>   That map has been favored by school board President Caprice Young,
who under the plan would move from a district centered in Hollywood
to one centered in the West Valley. That could improve her chances
for reelection because of the majority of white voters in the new
area.</LD>
<LD>   The map approved by the 15-member Los Angeles Redistricting
Commission for the Los Angeles Unified School District now goes to
the City Council for approval.</LD>
<TE>   The meeting became heated, with commissioner Irma Hopkins accusing
fellow commissioners of basing their decision on politics.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been contaminated with all the political maneuvering
going on," Hopkins said. "We're here to represent the parents and the
kids."</TE>
<TE>   New boundaries must be adopted by June 30, but the next school
board election using them won't be held until next March.</TE>
<TE>   The other proposed map, which the commission rejected, was drawn
by Alan Clayton of the California Latino Redistricting Coalition and
presented by an appointee of board member Julie Korenstein. It would
have split the Valley at the San Diego Freeway and put North
Hollywood and Studio City into a district with West L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Under the map that was approved, Korenstein would lose 24% of her
potential white voters, because her new district would confine her to
a heavily Latino district in the East Valley. She currently oversees
parts of the central and West Valley in addition to the East Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-6 vote came amid accusations of behind-the-scenes lobbying
by former L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan, a past supporter of Young.
Korenstein also argued that an administrator for the commission was
biased toward the map favored by Young.</TE>
<TE>   "This did not come as a surprise. I knew all about the back-door
deals," Korenstein said. "I think it was a sham, the closest thing to
a kangaroo court."</TE>
<TE>   One of the commissioners who voted for the map that was approved,
Jonathan Zasloff, said there was a misconception that the alternative
proposal was good for the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a large place. There isn't a unified Valley. It's very
diverse," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The commission consists of seven appointees by school board
members, four appointees of the mayor and four appointees of the City
Council president.</TE>
<TE>   Appointees of Young and of school board members Jose Huizar,
Marlene Canter and Mike Lansing voted for the map that was approved.
Appointees of board members David Tokofsky, Korenstein and Genethia
Hayes voted for the alternative.</TE>

<LD>Former Laker player and current Sparks' Coach Michael Cooper, who had
expressed interest in the vacant coaching position at the University
of New Mexico, said Wednesday he should not be considered a
candidate.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm happy with the Sparks and I am loyal to them," said Cooper,
who led the team to the 2001 WNBA championship and signed a two-year
contract over the summer.</LD>
<LD>   Cooper, who played basketball at New Mexico from 1976-78, was one
of several people linked to the vacancy after Coach Fran Fraschilla
resigned Saturday. Others reportedly interested include Sidney Green,
who played for Nevada Las Vegas and the Chicago Bulls, and coaches at
Florida Atlantic University; former Illinois and Bull Coach Tim
Floyd; and University of San Diego Coach Brad Holland.</LD>
<TE>   A member of five Laker championship teams during his 11-year NBA
career, Cooper joined the Sparks in 1999 as an assistant and later
that year was named head coach. In two seasons he has directed the
Sparks to consecutive 28-4 regular-season records and one WNBA title.</TE>

<TE>   Bob Bender was fired Tuesday after nine seasons as coach at
Washington. Athletic Director Barbara Hedges announced the coaching
change Wednesday, saying she asked Bender, 44, to resign during a
20-minute meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Hedges said Washington's win-loss record played a big part in her
decision. The Huskies had consecutive 20-loss seasons for the first
time in school history before finishing 11-18 and eighth in the
Pac-10 this season. Bender had a 116-142 record.</TE>

<TE>   The father of Oklahoma Coach Kelvin Sampson had emergency brain
surgery after falling ill during the Sooners' practice Tuesday at San
Jose. John W. Sampson, 72, known as Ned, had surgery for a subdural
hematoma, or blood collecting on the brain, at about midnight,
Oklahoma team physician Brock Schnebel said Wednesday.</TE>

<DH>College basketball: No one has forgotten Edney's winning
drive against Missouri in 1995.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Half a world away, in a Barcelona hotel room, Tyus Edney will drag
himself out of bed tonight and flick on the television set.</LD>
<LD>   Chances are none of the channels will carry the NCAA regional
semifinal between UCLA and Missouri, which begins around 4 a.m. in
Spain. Still, he will check.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd like to see it," he said. "It would bring back good
memories."</LD>
<TE>   Seven years ago--the last time these teams met--he was a senior
point guard for the Bruins. His last-second heroics, driving the
length of the court and scoring at the buzzer, propelled UCLA through
the second round and onward to a national championship.</TE>
<TE>   That day ranks as a highlight for a player who subsequently toiled
as an NBA journeyman and now leads Benetton Treviso, a team in the
Italian and Euroleagues. With road games stretching from Barcelona to
Istanbul to Tel Aviv, he has been forced to follow his alma mater via
the Internet and phone calls from home.</TE>
<TE>   Friends have mentioned that clips of his 1995 play are showing on
all the Los Angeles television stations these days.</TE>
<TE>   "It was cool when I heard that," he told The Times by phone
Wednesday from Barcelona. "It's good to know people still remember."</TE>
<TE>   Still remember?</TE>
<TE>   UCLA Coach Steve Lavin, an assistant to Jim Harrick at the time,
called it "a storybook finish. I remember 15 or 20 minutes later in
the locker room, the team was just so excited." Harrick, now at
Georgia, has referred to the play as "a defining moment of my
coaching career."</TE>
<TE>   Such nostalgia is not limited to people who were in the arena in
Boise, Idaho, that night. UCLA freshman Cedric Bozeman was a
youngster watching on television at his grandmother's house.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a big giant-killer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Only 4.8 seconds remained when Missouri's Julian Winfield scored
to give the Tigers a one-point lead. While some former UCLA players
recall feeling confident, Edney feared his top-seeded team was sunk.</TE>
<TE>   During the ensuing timeout, one of Harrick's assistants suggested
a long inbounds pass, but Harrick told him: "Be quiet, I know what
I'm doing." The idea originated years earlier as the coach watched
Jerry West win a game for the Lakers. All season long, UCLA had
practiced a six-second drill in which Edney took the ball all the
way.</TE>
<TE>   "Just get into the key," Edney said. "Look for a quick pass or
some kind of a shot if I'm open."</TE>
<TE>   The play worked perfectly. Edney dribbled up the left sideline,
then lost his defender with a left-handed, behind-the-back dribble.
That freed him to drive the right side of the lane for a baby hook
over two defenders.</TE>
<TE>   The ball banked off the glass and through the basket with no time
remaining. The Bruins won, 75-74.</TE>
<TE>   "Just watching the ball go in," he said, "it was kind of
unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   It was the pinnacle of a career that has also known lows.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after the Missouri game, Edney injured his wrist and
lasted only a few minutes into the final against Arkansas, watching
from the bench as sophomore Cameron Dollar led the team to its 11th
national championship and first in 20 years. "Definitely I was
disappointed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He rebounded as a rookie in the NBA, playing well as a
second-round draft pick for the Sacramento Kings. But things did not
go as smoothly the next season, or the one after that when he signed
with the Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   A former Bruin teammate, Ed O'Bannon, has spoken about the
difficulty of trying to recapture the excitement of that 1995
tournament run. Edney did his best not to dwell on the game-winning
shot against Missouri, but "people kept mentioning it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he landed overseas and helped Zalgiris Kaunas become the
first Lithuanian team to win a Euroleague title. Then came an
injury-shortened season with the Indiana Pacers. Then a return trip
across the Atlantic to play for Benetton.</TE>
<TE>   It seems European basketball agrees with him.</TE>
<TE>   "It reminds me of the college game," he said. "The players are
stronger and more talented, but the style of the game, there's a lot
of zone. It's still a team game instead of an individual game."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, UCLA games are rarely televised in Italy. Word
filters to him in bits and pieces.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it has been an up-and-down year for them," he said. "But
they're a talented team and it was a great win against Cincinnati."</TE>
<TE>   So he will interrupt a good night's sleep in hopes of catching
them on television tonight, hours after Benetton's game against
Barcelona. Edney hopes that UCLA's second-round upset of Cincinnati
will give the team a boost, a launching point for a championship run.</TE>
<TE>   Just like seven years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "You can feed off something like that," he said. "It gives you a
chance."</TE>

<HD>Santa Anita Derby Losing Contenders</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Medaglia d'Oro, the upset winner of Sunday's San Felipe Stakes, won't
participate in the $750,000 Santa Anita Derby on April 6, heading
instead to Aqueduct in New York for the Wood Memorial a week later.</LD>
<LD>   Siphonic, the favorite who failed to win for a second consecutive
time in the San Felipe, also will not return in the local Derby.</LD>
<LD>   Trainer Dave Hofmans indicated Wednesday morning the Siphon colt,
once considered the leading Kentucky Derby contender, will make his
next start out of town. Hofmans mentioned three possibilities--the
Wood, the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland and the Arkansas Derby at
Oaklawn Park. All of those races are on April 13.</LD>
<TE>   Although Hofmans said Siphonic was fine after the San Felipe,
where he finished third at 2-5, some blood work was done on the
3-year-old to make sure all is well. The trainer said the results are
expected today.</TE>
<TE>   "We had it done just to see what's going on with him," said
Hofmans, who keeps his stables at Hollywood Park. "He looks very good
and he is sound. The race Sunday was very uncharacteristic for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just not sure how much he likes that track. That was his
second [subpar] race over there."</TE>
<TE>   In his first start of 2002, Siphonic was second to the
now-sidelined Labamta Babe as the 1-10 favorite in the Santa Catalina
Stakes. He did stumble badly at the start to lose his best chance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Martin Pedroza won the first four races on Wednesday's card
and three of the victories came for trainer Jack Carava.</TE>
<TE>   After winning the first 2-year-old race of the year with 7-2 Solar
Bee for trainer Lonnie Stokes, Pedroza came back with J Vivendi at
19-10 in the second , 6-1 Tara Nina in the third and Big Bad Juan at
3-1 in the fourth. He missed a fifth victory when 4-1 Morning Wine
was beaten by a nose by Big Shakespeare in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Pedroza, who had a six-winner day on Oct. 31, 1992, during the Oak
Tree meet, will leave today for Dubai.</TE>
<TE>   He will ride Men's Exclusive in the $2-million Golden Shaheen on
Saturday.</TE>

<HD>MLS Insists Less Is More This Season</HD>
<DH>Soccer: With two fewer teams, league officials say
competition will be better because player talent is concentrated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major League Soccer has talked for a long time about having "a bigger
national footprint," but the league has gone about it in an odd way
since the end of last season.</LD>
<LD>   Having lopped off a couple of its toes, so to speak, MLS will
leave only 10 indentations in the sporting sand when its 2002 season
opens Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   That's fine as far as footprints go--perfectly normal, in
fact--but having 10 teams instead of 12 hardly makes MLS more
prominent.</LD>
<TE>   As part of an off-season of cutbacks and reevaluation, the league
folded the Miami Fusion and Tampa Bay Mutiny. It then argued that
smaller means stronger and that the concentration of player talent in
the surviving 10 teams will make MLS games more competitive.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is anything positive [about contraction], it will be
that we had two teams that had some great players and they'll make
[the remaining] teams better," Don Garber, the league's commissioner,
said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt that's accurate, but it didn't help earlier this week
when Bruce Arena, the U.S. national team coach, was quoted as saying
that MLS "could fold at any time." On Wednesday, Arena and Garber
were quick to counter that impression.</TE>
<TE>   "I was responding to a question regarding MLS' role in player
development," Arena said, "and really should have stated it in a
little better manner, simply saying that I don't think their feet are
on the ground yet to take on that huge financial responsibility of
player development.</TE>
<TE>   "With contraction and everything else, I think that's the last
thing on their minds right now. It's going to take some time. I'm
confident the league is going to prosper. I'm confident that 20 years
down the road, MLS is going to be here.... I'm a big supporter of
MLS. If I worded [the answer] incorrectly, I apologize."</TE>
<TE>   Garber, too, emphasized the league's long-term viability.</TE>
<TE>   "This league is here for the long haul," he said. "One of our
owners [the Anschutz Entertainment Group] just put $100 million into
bricks and mortar [for a new stadium in Carson].... We've got a [new]
five-year television agreement with ABC and ESPN.... It is
inconceivable that anyone, with all due respect to our national team
coach, can think that this league is not here for the long haul.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a long and, at times, difficult process, getting to
where we need to get to, but no one should have any doubt [about the
league's future]."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that five MLS teams are controlled by the Anschutz group,
which Tuesday also added a half-ownership in the defending-champion
San Jose Earthquakes, and that Hunt Sports' stake in the league soon
will grow from two teams to three with the addition of the Dallas
Burn to its ranks, was dismissed by Garber as being not worrisome.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very committed, small group of people who have a vision
of what professional soccer can be in this country," he said. "One of
our real goals is to expand the number of people who have that
vision.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need to do in order to attract more people into our fold
is to have a more profitable business.</TE>
<TE>   "In the long term, we want and expect to have a broader group of
ownership, [but] we are where we are. The world has changed. The
economy has changed. The fact that we still have a bunch of very
committed and smart and well-to-do folks still engaged in our sport
gives us more stability than we would have if they weren't
committed."</TE>
<TE>   In a game of feet, progress in MLS is measured in inches.</TE>

<KH>Robyn Norwood ON COLLEGE BASKETBALL</KH>
<HD>A March to Madness With Different Twist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kent State is a March darling and guard Trevor Huffman is finding
celebrity has its price.</LD>
<LD>   "I went to get some chicken wings and I couldn't even eat them,"
he said. "People thought they knew me. They started eating my chicken
wings. I was like, 'I don't know you. Stop eating my chicken wings!'"</LD>
<LD>   A year after upsetting Indiana in the first round, the Golden
Flashes are back and they are better.</LD>
<TE>   They have beaten Oklahoma State and Alabama, teams that were in
the top 10 at one point, and they play Pittsburgh today in an NCAA
South Regional semifinal game the Golden Flashes might be capable of
winning.</TE>
<TE>   If they do, they'll join such so-called mid-majors as Rhode Island
in 1998, Gonzaga in 1999 and Tulsa in 2000 by making the Elite Eight.</TE>
<TE>   What is remarkable is Kent State has reached this point despite a
bumpy coaching transition, a 4-4 start and a shooting slump that
Huffman shook off by, um ... well, by watching Oprah Winfrey's show.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, Oprah helped me out," said Huffman, a 6-foot-1 senior who
is on a 12-game tear, averaging 19 points and shooting 53% from
three-point range during that stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to regroup and I was watching Oprah. My roommate
said, 'What are you doing, man?' But Marsha the Life Coach was
helping moms de-stress their lives. I used some of the same
techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "I cleaned up my room. Not sparkling. But I took all my clothes I
don't wear to Goodwill. I decluttered my life."</TE>
<TE>   He laughs as he tells the story.</TE>
<TE>   "To all the guys out there, I haven't seen the show since," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't seen a loss since then, either, breaking out of his
slump during Kent State's 20-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just feeling the expectations, the pressure of trying to
lead my team to the same place as last year," Huffman said. "It's a
difficult thing to stay on top season after season."</TE>
<TE>   The degree of difficulty is even higher when a team loses its
coach.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Waters left for Rutgers after the second-round loss to
Cincinnati last year.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Stan Heath, who had been an assistant to Tom Izzo at
Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   Before the players were used to calling him "Coach," Kent State
had lost to Hofstra.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Golden Flashes lost to Youngstown State on the way
to that 4-4 start, they knew they had problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just so loyal to Coach Waters and that staff," Huffman
said. "It was a difficult transition. After we went 4-4, we knew we
had to get together. The seniors made a stand."</TE>
<TE>   They had to buy into a new offensive system and a new style.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't press any more and we were all used to going up and
down," Huffman said. "It took some getting used to."</TE>
<TE>   When Waters, their former coach, phoned some of the players, they
finally came around.</TE>
<TE>   "The call was on Christmas," guard Andrew Mitchell said. "To hear
Coach Waters' voice on Christmas morning was probably the greatest
thing in the world. You know, it's a familiar voice. He just took us
all back to the basics and asked us why we were playing this game,
because we love it, or what.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point we realized, somebody we'd been with really cares
about us and is still watching. We just did what we needed to get the
team going in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   They quit resisting the changes Heath had installed and started
playing his way.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew Coach Heath had been on a staff that had achieved a lot
of things our team wanted to do," Mitchell said. "He'd coached in the
Final Four. He'd coached in the championship game."</TE>
<TE>   Now he's back in the Sweet 16, but no longer as an assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Heath, 37, has the look of a rising star.</TE>
<TE>   He spent five years as an assistant at Michigan State, reaching
the Final Four three times and winning the 2000 title.</TE>
<TE>   But he had roots in the Mid-American Conference as a former
assistant at Bowling Green who had played at Eastern Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very underrated," Heath said of the MAC, which has only one
team in the tournament despite a proven record against major teams.</TE>
<TE>   "How a league can get multiple teams in the NCAA is beyond me. We
did some things as a conference that are very deserving. With Ball
State beating Kansas, one of the No.1 teams in the country, and
beating UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "With Bowling Green beating Ole Miss, with so many impressive
nonconference wins, hopefully that woke up some eyes and let people
know there are some quality teams.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question, if Bowling Green and Ball State were in this
tournament they would have done extremely well. I'm just a firm
believer that we need to open up some doors to teams like Kent State,
to Bowling Green, to Ball State.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, who's to say, if we lost to Marshall [in the MAC
tournament quarterfinals], we might not be sitting here right now,
and I think that would be a travesty."</TE>
<TE>   Coaching Moves</TE>
<TE>   Bob Bender was forced out at Washington this week, a move that
clearly was difficult for Athletic Director Barbara Hedges because
she hired Bender and was close to his family.</TE>
<TE>   But Bender--who came this close to reaching the Elite Eight in
1998 before Richard Hamilton gave Connecticut a one-point victory on
a tip-in in the final moments--never made much progress.</TE>
<TE>   This was Washington's third consecutive losing season and the
Huskies never recovered after Todd MacCulloch completed his
eligibility. Dan Dickau's transfer to Gonzaga was another blow, and
Senque Carey transferred to New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, Oregon's Luke Ridnour is a Washington native, as is Dickau.</TE>
<TE>   Names that will be bandied about include St. Louis Coach Lorenzo
Romar, who played at Washington, as well as Gonzaga's Mark Few,
Missouri's Quin Snyder, who is from Mercer Island, Wash., and
Pittsburgh's Ben Howland.</TE>
<TE>   Howland, a national coach-of-the-year candidate, said he intends
to stay at Pittsburgh, where his daughter, Meredith, will be a
freshman next year and a new arena will open next season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in the process right now of signing a new long-term
commitment with the University of Pittsburgh and that will probably
be consummated and done when I get back early next week," Howland
said.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson Mess</TE>
<TE>   The saga of Nolan Richardson's departure as Arkansas coach got
messier this week with the release of Chancellor John White's notes
on his meeting with Richardson and Frank Broyles.</TE>
<TE>   Little Rock television station KATV posted the transcript on its
Web site, with White's notes revealing Richardson believed Broyles
had been seeking to fire him and that he had plans for a book that
would be critical of Broyles.</TE>
<TE>   "When I finish telling everything about you [Frank], your legacy
will never be the same," White quoted Richardson as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson also threatened a court battle that would raise racial
issues, White wrote, quoting Richardson:</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to find out what trouble is. You haven't seen
anything yet. Just wait. We will take this state back to 1957. There
will be picketing all around here.... You'll have to have tanks in
the parking lots."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson also elaborated on his belief he was treated
differently than white coaches at the school, including football
Coach Houston Nutt.</TE>
<TE>   "[Richardson] said that if Houston had a player that got in
trouble, he might make him miss a game, but if Nolan's players did
something they had to be suspended for a semester. He said that the
media treated Houston differently, too.</TE>
<TE>   "He said if one of Houston's players did something wrong, then
Houston was given credit for working with them. But, if one of
Nolan's black players did anything wrong, they were labeled by the
media as ... thugs."</TE>
<TE>   University President B. Alan Sugg is reviewing Richardson's
termination, but issued a statement saying no announcement would be
made Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Pod System</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA was generally pleased with its new attempt to keep some
teams closer to home for the first two rounds, but the situation that
allowed sixth-seeded Texas to play in Dallas against third-seeded
Mississippi State is widely being cited as a flaw.</TE>
<TE>   "People should not have an opportunity that others don't have
unless it's an earned opportunity," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said.</TE>
<TE>   There were fewer objections to top-seeded Maryland playing in
Washington, D.C., for example.</TE>
<TE>   Krzyzewski also questioned situations that allow a team to have
one more day of rest than its Sweet 16 opponent if it played a
Saturday second-round game and its next opponent played a Sunday
game.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Basketball Coaches will address the system
at its Final Four meetings, and meet with the NCAA about the issue in
May.</TE>

<TE>   Duke vs. Indiana: Who's a Rupp Arena regular to cheer for?
Kentucky fans hate Duke. (Think Christian Laettner, with his miracle
shot in the 1992 East Regional final.) Indiana's not a much better
option. "Well, I love Kentucky," Hoosier Coach Mike Davis said,
trying to woo fans to his side. "They're my favorite team other than
Indiana. I hope they make it to the Final Four.... They don't like
Indiana and they don't like Duke, but I hope their hatred for Duke is
more than it is for Indiana." Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski feigned
obliviousness. "I see all these 'K' flags all around," he said. "I
thought they were for me." Most definitely not--though Kentucky got
the better of Duke in their last NCAA meeting, another regional final
in 1998. Duke is even using the Kentucky locker room during its stay
in Lexington. "It's really weird," Mike Dunleavy said. "It's the
right color.... but coming in here sitting in Tayshaun Prince's and
Keith Bogans' lockers, it's a little strange." Duke and Indiana last
met in the NCAA tournament in the 1992 Final Four in a Duke semifinal
victory, but some of these players know each other well. Jared
Jeffries, the Hoosiers' 6-foot-10 star, also considered Duke. "He's a
great kid and a terrific player. I got to know him when he came to
visit," said Dunleavy, who has the same sort of inside-outside
skills. Davis was still working on swaying Kentucky fans. "I
apologize if I've ever said anything to offend any Kentucky fan. I
let my little boy wear blue sometimes," he said. "We need all the
help we can get.... I just want to make it very clear that I do love
Kentucky."</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh vs. Kent State: The Golden Flashes are obvious
underdogs--a 10th-seeded team going against a No. 3. But should they
be? Kent State defeated No. 7 Oklahoma State and No. 2 Alabama in the
first two rounds. "They are a very, very good team," Pittsburgh Coach
Ben Howland said. "They are very well-coached. They really execute on
the offensive end. They play great defense. They have beaten two very
good teams in this tournament." He also likes Kent State guard Trevor
Huffman. "He could play for anybody in the country," Howland said.
Like Pittsburgh, Kent State starts a relatively small lineup. Only
center Nate Gerwig, at 6-foot-9, is over 6-5. Pittsburgh's big men
are 6-7 Chevon Troutman and 6-8 Donatas Zavackas. Pittsburgh plays
bruising defense, giving up only 60 points a game, but Kent State has
two good scorers in Huffman and 5-11, 150-pound Andrew Mitchell.
Pittsburgh's Brandin Knight is impressed. "I don't know how many
games they have to win for people to realize they are not a
Cinderella," he said. Knight said his right quadriceps injury still
hurts, but doesn't affect his play. "I'm still playing with a little
pain, but once you get in the game, all thoughts about my leg are out
the window," he said. Pittsburgh and Kent State had similar results
against common opponents Robert Morris and Illinois State. Pittsburgh
beat Robert Morris, 86-62, and Illinois State, 65-46. Kent State beat
Robert Morris, 83-55, and Illinois State, 61-48.</TE>

<LD>Style of play: Youthful Missouri Coach Quin Snyder likes basketball
as a rock concert--stepping up the tempo, cranking up the volume and
enjoying the frenzy. UCLA Coach Steve Lavin prefers improvisation,
deciding whether to make wholesale substitutions or stick with his
veteran starters based on the flow of the game and gut instinct. If
great shooters/poor defenders Jason Kapono and Billy Knight aren't
getting open shots and are getting beat down the floor, expect Lavin
to get athletic freshmen Dijon Thompson and Andre Patterson into the
game early.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Matchup to watch: Missouri's three-point shooters vs. UCLA's
three-point shooters. Kareem Rush and Clarence Gilbert of Missouri
have launched a stunning 551 shots from the arc, making 218. Ricky
Paulding has made another 45. The long-range attempts of Kapono and
Knight pale in comparison (147 of 338). Matt Barnes has made another
49. The team that chases the other team's bombers most effectively
should win.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Intangibles: The media is making a huge revenge motive out of Tyus
Edney's length-of-the-court miracle drive that enabled UCLA to beat
Missouri in the second round of the 1995 tournament. Everyone but the
Tigers, who claim they haven't given it 4.8 seconds thought. "We
understand what it means to Missouri fans," Paulding said. "But we've
got to look at it as this Missouri team trying to beat this UCLA
team. [1995] is not motivation for us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Magic numbers: Missouri is the lowest seeded team alive in the
tournament and can become the first No. 12 to advance to the Elite
Eight. UCLA has lost in the Sweet 16 the last two seasons and has
advanced to the Elite Eight once in Lavin's six seasons, in 1997.
Both teams were more highly regarded early in the season. Missouri
was ranked No. 2 in December and UCLA was No. 3 in November.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Final analysis: This is a game between the nation's most
unpredictable teams. It's bound to be entertaining and full of
surprises. But picking a winner is a coin flip.</TE>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>After being wracked by early defections and losing four starters to
the NBA draft last summer, Lute Olson went into Nostradamus mode,
prophesizing about the doom and gloom that awaited his young Arizona
team as it headed for the toughest schedule in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   The anonymous Wildcats then began the year by knocking off No. 2
Maryland, No. 5 Florida, No. 23 Texas and No. 5 Illinois in their
first five games.</LD>
<LD>   And when the Pacific 10 Conference resurrected its
end-of-the-season tournament, the Wildcat coach led the picket
parade, complaining that it undermined the regular season title's
significance and mourning the missed class time.</LD>
<TE>   The no-longer-unknown Wildcats then responded by clawing their way
to the tournament championship with a commanding
three-games-in-three-days-performance.</TE>
<TE>   Any guesses as to what that master sandbagger's mood is entering
the No. 3-seeded Wildcats' West Regional semifinal against No.
2-seeded Oklahoma today at Compaq Center?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough matchup for us," Olson said of the Sooners. "The
three teams that they would be the most like would be the three teams
we've had the most trouble with--Connecticut, Kansas and Oregon.
[Oklahoma's] perimeter guys are very quick, they shoot the ball from
[deep outside] but they take the ball to the basket really well too
... very quick perimeter players. They go to the boards a lot,
similar to USC. They send four guys and they're very athletic and
very quick.</TE>
<TE>   "[Oklahoma is] in an attack mode all the time with their
quickness."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like an Arizona rout, right?</TE>
<TE>   Well, the Wildcats are an extension of their coach.</TE>
<TE>   "From what I've heard, they're a really big, physical team," said
junior forward Luke Walton. "We're going to prepare for a war."</TE>
<TE>   Said junior guard Jason Gardner: "I know [the Sooners] are big
guys and one of our biggest things is getting offensive boards and
that's one of their strongest points...they go to the boards hard."</TE>
<TE>   But Gardner, who initially applied for the NBA draft before
withdrawing his name and returning to school, also swerved from
Olson's path of self-deprecation in describing the difference between
the Arizona and Oklahoma backcourts.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, we've got a bit of an advantage," Gardner said,
"because we've been playing quick guards all year long in the Pac-10.
I don't know about the Big 12's guards."</TE>
<TE>   Like the Wildcats (24-9), the Sooners (29-4) are coming off an
unexpected conference tournament championship, having upset
then-top-ranked Kansas in the Big 12 title game, 64-55.</TE>
<TE>   Many expected the third-ranked Sooners to be awarded the No. 1
seeding in the West but it was instead given to Cincinnati, which was
upended in double overtime by UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "Our initial thought about getting a No. 2 seed was we were
disappointed," said Sooner senior forward Aaron McGhee. "But Coach
[Kelvin] Sampson did a good job of telling us we ... just needed to
win games."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma has beaten Arizona three times in the four games they
have met, including in the 1988 Final Four, 86-78, and in the first
round of the 1999 NCAA tournament, 61-60.</TE>
<TE>   While Olson doesn't predict which will prevail--Arizona's
quickness and diversity or Oklahoma's size and guile--it doesn't take
a crystal ball for Gardner to figure it out.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing is don't look ahead," he said. "If things aren't
going your way, you can't get down. After the first round, you really
get an understanding about playing hard. You understand what's going
on in the tournament. It shows that you can't look ahead and that
seeds don't matter because anyone can beat anybody."</TE>

<HD>Completion of Years-Long PCH Sewer Project Expected by May</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bonnie Frankel has finally learned to block out the almost nonstop
drilling, rumbling trucks and traffic bottlenecks on her little
stretch of Pacific Coast Highway.</LD>
<LD>   It's been more than two years since Santa Monica officials started
replacing nearly 8,000 feet of quake-damaged sewer line that runs
from the Santa Monica Pier to Chautauqua Boulevard--and right in
front of Frankel's driveway.</LD>
<LD>   The prolonged construction has snarled traffic along the crowded
coastal route, infuriated locals along the stretch once known as the
"Gold Coast" and sparked a lawsuit by those who want to keep traffic
moving.</LD>
<TE>   But Frankel, her neighbors and the estimated 75,000 drivers who
inch through the corridor each day finally may be able to relax come
Memorial Day, when the $25-million project is expected to be
finished--two years after its expected completion date.</TE>
<TE>   If workers can't make that deadline, completion will be postponed
until the fall. Each year, crews have stopped construction from
Memorial Day to Labor Day to avoid impeding beach traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy adventure more than anyone, but this has been brutal,"
said Frankel, 57, who lives on the first floor of an apartment
building facing one of the construction staging areas. "You've really
got to love the beach to put up with the hassles of living here."</TE>
<TE>   The project has closed at least two lanes of PCH for eight months
each year since late 1999, with Caltrans reopening all lanes during
the tourist-heavy summer months.</TE>
<TE>   City officials acknowledged that the project is disruptive but
said it is necessary to repair large cracks the system sustained
during the 1994 Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not in any imminent danger of breaking, but we're all kind
of holding our breath until the new line is finished," said program
manager Jack Schroeder of the city's Disaster Recovery Office.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Emergency Management Agency is paying more than half
of the project's tab, with the city of Los Angeles picking up the
bulk of the remaining cost, he said. (Los Angeles pays because the
line primarily serves Pacific Palisades, within Los Angeles city
limits.)</TE>
<TE>   The new 60-inch pipe, part of a $90-million sewer system overhaul,
will serve the Santa Monica and Pacific Palisades areas for the next
century, making a two-year delay almost negligible, Schroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to be this disruptive, we only want to do it
once," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica had originally projected that the sewer line would be
repaired within eight months of its November 1999 start date, at a
cost of $9.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   But what seemed like a simple excavation project soon came to
resemble an archeological dig. Fallen trees, 10-inch rocks and other
objects had to be extracted from the ground, Schroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't have any idea what we were going to encounter," he
said. "It wasn't a one-year project that ran over. It was a
three-year project that we horribly underestimated."</TE>
<TE>   Although workers try to drill through at least 60 feet of dirt per
day, soil conditions sometimes allow the tunneling machines to move
only two to three feet.</TE>
<TE>   Workers recently explored a 30-foot-wide hole, where electrical
wires dangled and gas lines snaked along the tunnel walls. The
machines have ruptured gas lines twice in the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to get this drill down a labyrinth of existing
utilities," Schroeder said. "It's a little bit like threading a
needle."</TE>
<TE>   Gas lines and timber aren't the only obstacles Santa Monica has
had to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Donald Sutherland and attorneys Chuck Levy and Browne
Greene, representing the residents who live along the highway, sued
Santa Monica when the city said sewer construction would force
turning off the signal light that controls traffic at the California
Incline--the long grade that delivers traffic between the coast
highway and Santa Monica's bluff-top business district.</TE>
<TE>   A barrier erected in the middle of the highway would have
prevented drivers traveling down the California Incline from turning
left, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been a total disaster, with no way of getting your
car into traffic," said Greene, whose office is in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations with Caltrans and the city have resulted in the
reinstatement of the left turn.</TE>
<TE>   Through suits and snarled traffic, the nearly 40 men doing the
labor continue to work.</TE>
<TE>   Building the new sewer line is Modern Continental, the same
company handling the monumental "Big Dig" project in Boston, which
will bring a subterranean freeway and park to downtown. The company
will have its employees in Santa Monica working in two shifts--24
hours a day, seven days a week--until they have drilled through the
last 1,700 feet of dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel, who has lived in her apartment for 14 years, said she has
little sympathy for the drivers who have been slowed by the
construction.</TE>
<TE>   "Dealing with traffic isn't that bad. Imagine having to listen to
drilling 24 hours a day," she said. "I'd rather them work less hours
than listen to this [noise] all day and all night."</TE>
<TE>   Although many local residents said they understand that the sewer
line needs to be repaired, they complained that passing motorists
block them from entering their driveways.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's nerves are tense trying to get through that
bottleneck," said area resident Peter Hamilton. "Courtesy just goes
by the wayside when people are frazzled."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Will history repeat itself 51 years later? Bill Calhoun certainly
hopes so.</LD>
<LD>   Calhoun, a forward on the Rochester (N.Y.) Royals' NBA
championship team in 1951, sees similarities between his former team
and the current Sacramento Kings, the Royals' franchise three cities
removed.</LD>
<LD>   One of the similarities is a rivalry with the Lakers.</LD>
<TE>   The Minneapolis Lakers won five NBA titles in six years starting
in 1949, with only the Royals interrupting the run, and they featured
a dominating center, George Mikan, who was the Shaquille O'Neal of
his era.</TE>
<TE>   Calhoun helped the Royals defeat Minneapolis in a best-of-five
series, three games to one, and advance to the NBA finals, where they
edged the New York Knickerbockers in the deciding seventh game,
79-75, to win the franchise's first and only title.</TE>
<TE>   Calhoun, 74, of Reno, sees a similar path this season for the
Kings, who honor the Royals by hanging their championship banner in
Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "I laugh about the Kings' team this year, they are so much like
us," he said. "I think they are going to beat the Lakers in the
playoffs this year. We did it one year. I think they can, too."</TE>
<TE>   We'll see. The Kings and Lakers meet for the third time this
season Sunday at Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the all-time record for points in the NCAA
men's basketball tournament?</TE>
<TE>   Treasure trove: Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas donated
more than 200 awards and other memorabilia to the Babe Ruth
Birthplace and Museum, the official museum of the Baltimore Orioles
and Colts. The items included his 1967 NFL most-valuable-player
award, his single-bar helmet and an autographed football
commemorating his last touchdown pass with the Baltimore Colts.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the main reasons this stuff is here is because I didn't
have a place to put it," Unitas joked.</TE>
<TE>   Crowded field: It's no April Fool's joke. The Oakland A's play
their home opener the night of April 1--the same night Paul McCartney
opens his U.S. concert tour next door at the Oakland Coliseum Arena.</TE>
<TE>   So are they expecting a traffic nightmare?</TE>
<TE>   Not if everyone takes BART, says A's spokesman Jim Bloom.</TE>
<TE>   Playing through: Who says golf is a leisurely game?</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Cain, the head pro at the Penn State Golf Courses in
State College, Pa., will try to break a Guinness world record next
month by playing 500 holes in 12 hours for charity. The 12-hour
record is 476 holes, set by Brennan Robertson in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Christian Laettner of Duke, 407, in four seasons
from 1989-92.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Fran Blinebury of the Houston Chronicle says a few
media members were watching the Houston Astros take infield practice
last week when Manager Jimy Williams suggested they consider changing
their seats:</TE>
<TE>   "'We're fine,' they told him. 'What could happen?'</TE>
<TE>   "With that, Williams took one hand, reached into his mouth and
came out with a partial plate of dentures that left him looking like
a jack-o'-lantern who had just lost a head-on collision with a
rhinoceros."</TE>
<TE>   After the shock wore off, there was laughter all around.</TE>

<TE>   Top players lost--Diego Gutierrez, Eric Wynalda.</TE>
<TE>   Top players gained--None.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook--The deepest and one of the best-coached teams in the
league will have to dig even deeper this season. First, World Cup
2002 will rob it of midfielder Chris Armas, for sure, and possibly
also forward Josh Wolff and midfielder DaMarcus Beasley. Second, the
renovation of Soldier Field has temporarily consigned the Fire to the
campus of North Central College in Naperville, Ill., a small field in
a small stadium with small crowds.</TE>

<TE>   COLUMBUS CREW</TE>
<TE>   Investor/operator--Hunt Sports.</TE>
<TE>   MLS championships--None.</TE>
<TE>   Home--Crew Stadium, Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Coach--Greg Andrulis.</TE>
<TE>   2001 record--13-7-6.</TE>
<TE>   Top players lost--Tenywa Bonseu, Ansil Elcock.</TE>
<TE>   Top players gained--Brian Dunseth, Chad McCarty.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook--For the Crew, a great deal will depend on the results it
can obtain while striker Brian McBride is busy with the U.S. national
team, before and during the World Cup. John Wilmar Perez pulls the
strings in midfield and, in Dante Washington, Jeff Cunningham and
Brian West, the Crew has plenty of speed, but its rebuilt defense
remains a question mark.</TE>

<TE>   NEW ENGLAND REVOLUTION</TE>
<TE>   Investor/operator--Kraft Soccer Properties.</TE>
<TE>   MLS championships--None.</TE>
<TE>   Home--CMGI Field, Foxboro, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Coach--Fernando Clavijo.</TE>
<TE>   2001 record--7-14-6</TE>
<TE>   Top players lost--Leonel Alvarez, Cate, William Sunsing.</TE>
<TE>   Top players gained--Adin Brown, Alex Pineda Chacon, Mamadou
Diallo, Carlos Llamosa, Jim Rooney.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook--No MLS team has undergone as drastic a transformation as
the Revolution, which even has a new stadium. Not least of the player
additions were Pineda Chacon and Diallo, the league's 2001 and 2000
scoring champions. The defense is bolstered by U.S. national team's
Llamosa. Midfielder Rooney is supposed to be the catalyst of the
team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEW YORK/NEW JERSEY METROSTARS</TE>
<TE>   Investor/operator--AEG.</TE>
<TE>   MLS championships--None.</TE>
<TE>   Home--Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Coach--Octavio Zambrano.</TE>
<TE>   2001 record--13-10-3.</TE>
<TE>   Top players lost--Mark Chung, Adolfo Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   Top players gained--Joe Addo, Marcelo Balboa, Diego Serna.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook--After obtaining volatile striker Serna to play up top
alongside Clint Mathis and the team's surprise standout of 2001,
Rodrigo Faria, Zambrano can have no complaints about his team's
offensive potential. Goalkeeper Tim Howard is one of the league's
best and the MetroStars' defense is solid, but much depends on
whether U.S. veteran Tab Ramos still can orchestrate everything from
midfield in his final season, especially considering the loss of
Chung.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WASHINGTON D.C. UNITED</TE>
<TE>   Investor/operator--AEG.</TE>
<TE>   MLS championships--Three (1996, 1997, 1999).</TE>
<TE>   Home--RFK Stadium, Washington.</TE>

<TE>   2001 record--8-16-2.</TE>
<TE>   Top players lost--Chris Albright, Stephen Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   Top players gained--Nick Rimando.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook--The three-time MLS champions have suffered through two
dismal seasons, something the arrival of live-wire coach Hudson is
supposed to correct. Unfortunately for Hudson, he has to work
miracles with a cast that hasn't changed much. And just how will
veteran playmaker Marco Etcheverry, fellow Bolivian Jaime Moreno and
striker Abdul Thompson Conteh respond to Hudson's peculiar
motivational style? It could be another long season in a difficult
division for D.C. United.</TE>

<LD>Major League Soccer, slimmer and trimmer after an off-season of
cutbacks, opens its seventh season Saturday afternoon when the
Columbus Crew hosts the Chicago Fire in a game that will be shown
live on ABC.</LD>
<LD>   The match is the first in a season that will end with MLS Cup
2002, the league's championship game, Oct. 20 at CMGI Field in
Foxboro, Mass.</LD>
<LD>   Midway through the season, on Aug. 3, the All-Star game will be
played at RFK Stadium in Washington and probably will feature a new
format, with MLS stars playing a team of international standouts.</LD>
<TE>   The league also is negotiating with FIFA, world soccer's governing
body, to bring the 2002 World Cup winner to either Giants Stadium in
East Rutherford, N.J., or to RFK Stadium for a Sept. 11 match against
a team of world all-stars. Proceeds would benefit victims of last
year's terrorist attacks on the United States.</TE>

<TE>   Outlook--Judging by the players they have added, the Rapids should
not repeat their miserable 2001 season. In Chung and Henderson, they
have added speed and creativity, while the addition of Mastroeni
makes the defense infinitely better. If Scottish striker John Spencer
can again score 14 goals as he did in 2001, Colorado could make the
division race interesting. The new stadium might help, but will
40-year-old Carlos Valderrama?</TE>

<TE>   Outlook--The Burn has never missed the playoffs but has never done
much once it got there. The loss of Graziani is huge and raises a
question about where the goals are going to come from. Jason Kreis

Landon Donovan are certain to make the U.S. World Cup team, which
will hurt San Jose at both ends of the field while they're gone.</TE>

<HD>Road Course Turns Heads at California Speedway</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: The 2.8-mile layout gets good reviews as
drivers prepare for a series of weekend races.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Buckler not only races a factory Porsche GT3 RS, but he is also
owner of his team, the Racers Group. So he was eager to get his first
look Wednesday at the new road course inside California Speedway--and
came away impressed.</LD>
<LD>   If not a little concerned.</LD>
<LD>   "I will predict there will be contact," Buckler said after driving
the speedway's latest addition. "There are definitely some one-car
corners."</LD>
<TE>   One-car corners that will no doubt be occupied by two cars as the
21-turn, 2.8-mile layout gets its first test this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Buckler still gave the course a thumb's up, which seemed the
consensus among the handful of drivers who got a preview Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The public will get its chance with this weekend's unique
combination of oval and road racing at the same venue.</TE>
<TE>   The new infield road circuit utilizes the front stretch of the
oval, as well as Turns 1 and 2, and reenters the oval at the end of
4. It will get its first competition test at 3:15 p.m. Friday with
one of two scheduled 30-minute Ferrari Challenges. The second takes
place at 10:15 a.m. Saturday followed by the Grand American 400 Rolex
Sports Car Series, scheduled for 142 laps with a four-hour time
limit, beginning Saturday at 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the Grand American Cup 250, an 89-lap race with a
three-hour time limit, gets its chance on the new course at 8 a.m.,
followed by the Indy Racing League's Yamaha Indy 400 on the two-mile
superspeedway at 12:30.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time California Speedway has played host to a
road course event. Grandstand seating added in Turns 9, 10, 13 and 14
in the infield is general admission, and 70% of the course can be
seen from those seats.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at a two-mile oval, you're limited in the amount of
activities you can have, especially spectator races," said Bill
Miller, president of California Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the course will also be used for the inaugural American
Motorcycle Assn. Yamaha Superbike Challenge April 5-7.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our goals was to add product and as a facility be able to
run all year; it gives you so much flexibility with events, racing
schools and testing," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of the road course, as well as a street-legal drag
strip in the parking lot, has Miller boasting that it gives credence
to California Speedway's new slogan, "America's Ultimate Race Place."</TE>
<TE>   And it may have added the ultimate stadium road course in the
U.S., drivers say.</TE>
<TE>   "For being a road course inside an oval, it's the best road course
I've ever been on," said Rand Racing driver Niclas Jonnson of Aliso
Viejo. "We race at Phoenix and Texas and there are hardly any passing
opportunities. Here, you're going to see a lot of speed, a lot of
passing. This has everything you can ask for."</TE>
<TE>   Cort Wagner, a Los Angeles native who will team with Bill Auberlen
of Hermosa Beach in the Scuderia Ferrari of Washington Ferrari 360
GT, provided input on the road course design during its early
construction last August.</TE>
<TE>   "We changed some of the diameter and radius of the corners to make
it as interesting and safe as possible for passing," Wagner said.
"The chicanes in the back are a little more gradual to make the
braking zone interesting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a horsepower track. Big brakes and big motors will excel
here."</TE>
<TE>   Wagner says there are enough straightaways for the faster cars--as
many as five classes race at the same time--to get past "without
forcing the issue."</TE>
<TE>   "What is unique is that there are a couple of high-speed
chicanes," Wagner said. "The only thing I didn't like about it was
that there's no grass, it has little aesthetic appeal. It will be
very interesting for the fans the way it's laid out."</TE>
<TE>   All that asphalt has made the speedway an even more valuable
commodity, Miller said. The 2.8-mile road course and 1.6-mile testing
circuit can be reconfigured as teams see fit.</TE>
<TE>   When Championship Auto Racing Teams drivers Michael Andretti,
Dario Franchitti and Paul Tracy tested tires and traction control,
Miller said they used different parts of the various layouts to
simulate turns in the Monterrey Grand Prix in Mexico, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Franchitti finished second at Monterrey, and Tracy had a chance to
win if not for a late-race mechanical problem.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said the facility will probably have 275-300 usage days
this year, noting that simultaneous usage of the oval, road course,
test course and drag strip count as four days.</TE>
<TE>   But there won't be any testing this weekend. Only racing.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought this place out pretty well," Buckler said. "To run
this track fast, you have to be extremely precise. ... I think you'll
see some real good racing."</TE>

<HD>Owners Try Gauging L.A. Fan Interest</HD>
<DH>NFL: Some, turned off by city's apparent nonchalance in
1999, doubt citizens would support football team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Before Los Angeles builds a great football stadium, NFL owners and
executives need an answer to the great unknown: Does the city really
want a team?</LD>
<LD>   The NFL says its games draw robust TV ratings in L.A., but
otherwise the league has little hard evidence of a fan base strong
enough to guarantee a packed house every week.</LD>
<LD>   "At a certain point in life you don't need any evidence that
there's a sun and a moon; it's there," NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue said Wednesday during his news conference that ended the
annual league meetings here. "We know the interest is there. There
has been, over the years, outstanding college football in Southern
California. There has been outstanding high school football, youth
football. There has been great interest in the NFL.</LD>
<TE>   "We have every reason to think that if and when we can get a team
there, and the fans have their own home team to root for, that the
interest will be there."</TE>
<TE>   Some NFL owners aren't so sure. They were turned off by what they
saw as nonchalance from L.A. in 1999, when Houston billionaire Robert
McNair paid $700 million for the 32nd franchise, topping L.A.'s best
offer by more than $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Where was L.A.'s passion?</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen it," Baltimore Raven owner Art Modell said.
"There's so much to do out there 12 months a year, it's got to be a
captivating element to capture people and sit them down for three to
four hours. I haven't seen it from people in L.A., let's be honest
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina Panther owner Jerry Richardson, chairman of the stadium
committee, said he spent countless hours into bringing the NFL back
to L.A. He came away frustrated and exasperated.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is Los Angeles had their chance," he said. "They had
an opportunity. It went to Houston. That's it. Thirty-two teams.
There aren't going to be more than 32 teams in my lifetime. So I
don't know. The train rolled by and they didn't get on. The train
keeps moving.</TE>
<TE>   "The NFL's not going out of business. I don't worry about the L.A.
situation. It's over. The ball's in their court."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson said the only two people he believes have the passion
and know-how to bring football back to L.A. are Michael Ovitz, who
launched a failed bid to land the expansion team three years ago, and
former Dodger owner Peter O'Malley.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Ovitz nor O'Malley is involved in the coalition that is
looking into building a privately financed stadium in downtown L.A.,
a proposal spearheaded by Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz, who
owns Staples Center. That high-powered group includes Ron Burkle, Ed
Roski and Casey Wasserman.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman, who owns arena football's L.A. Avengers, attended the
meetings and met with several NFL owners, although his immediate
concern was convincing the league to exercise its option to acquire a
percentage of the Arena Football League, which the owners decided not
to do.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Mayor James K. Hahn has praised the efforts of the Anschutz
group, although he has stopped short of endorsing it. Hahn said he
supports anyone who wants to bring the NFL back to L.A., provided the
push does not involve public funds.</TE>
<TE>   The Anschutz group, sensitive about driving up the price of the
land it needs, will not divulge its proposed location for a stadium.
Many downtown business leaders and real estate specialists said they
were unaware of the proposal or of any effort to acquire all or part
of the necessary 10 city blocks to build the project.</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't approached us about that," said Carol Schatz,
president of the Central City Assn., downtown's leading business
advocacy group. "They are playing it close to the vest."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Raider executive Bruce Allen is convinced the public will
get behind the project, spiritually if not financially. Allen, who
recently sold his home in Redondo Beach, said anyone who thinks
people in L.A. are dispassionate about getting an NFL team is missing
the point. If people in L.A. shrug at the thought of professional
sports, he says, why was a Laker flag fluttering seemingly on every
other car during last year's championship run?</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is completely different than it's been portrayed," he said.
"It's everything. It's blue-collar, it's white-collar, it's suits,
it's flip-flops. You can't make a blanket statement about L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the NFL would benefit greatly from having a team in L.A.,
particularly when it comes to negotiating a new TV contract. It is,
after all, the nation's No. 2 TV market.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody can tell me that L.A. is not an imperative in the lineup
of major-league cities for a sports league," Modell said. "They'd be
insane. There's nothing like it. But the diversity of activities
there is harmful. I guarantee that if you're in Green Bay in the
fall, there's not much else to do."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Eagle owner Jeffrey Lurie, who lived in L.A. for a
decade while working in the film industry, said the argument the city
cannot support a team because there are too many things to do simply
doesn't make sense.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge market," he said. "It's OK that a certain percentage
of people will go to the movies and do other things. That's OK. It's
just so huge. It all depends on whether they can get a stadium built,
and it's not anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, not only would L.A. get a stadium and a new
team, but almost surely the opportunity to host several Super Bowls.
And according to the NFL, a Super Bowl pumps between $300 million and
$400 million into the host city's economy.</TE>
<TE>   "If business and political leaders in Los Angeles do not see the
value of having rotating Super Bowls, that's amazing," Richardson
said. "Why is it that New York City or Washington or Detroit or
Atlanta see such great value in a Super Bowl, when apparently the
business community [in L.A.] doesn't see that? The numbers are not a
mystery."</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Wilson, owner of the Buffalo Bills, can sum up the L.A.
opportunity in one word--yawn.</TE>
<TE>   "There was so much apathy the last time," he said. "It was like,
'Hey, NFL, you ought to feel very, very lucky we let you in here.'
That was the message."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their vastly different opinions on the interest of fans in
Southern California, everyone in the NFL--and the rest of the
football world--can relate to the response of Denver Bronco owner Pat
Bowlen when asked about the prospects of a stadium in downtown L.A.:</TE>
<TE>   "I'll believe it when I see it."</TE>

<LD>Four environmental groups sued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on
Wednesday, arguing that the federal agency violated its promise to
protect waterways crucial to the Santa Ana sucker, a fish found in
four Southern California waterways.</LD>
<LD>   The American Fisheries Society, California Trout Inc., the Center
for Biological Diversity and Friends of the River filed the suit in
federal court in San Francisco. It alleges that the federal wildlife
agency violated a court-approved settlement that required it to act
by January 2001 to protect waterways crucial to the survival of the
threatened species.</LD>
<LD>   The sucker, which uses its little mouth and large, thick lips to
vacuum algae and invertebrates from stream beds, used to be found in
clear creeks and bodies of water throughout the Southland. But
development, the paving of streams, competition from nonnative
species, water pollution and other factors have pushed it out of 75%
of its historic range. The small, threatened bottom-feeder is
currently found in small stretches of the Santa Ana, San Gabriel and
Santa Clara rivers and Big Tujunga Creek.</LD>
<TE>   After a six-year legal battle, the Fish and Wildlife Service
designated the fish as "threatened" in April 2000. At the time, Joan
Jewett, spokeswoman for the service's regional office in Portland,
Ore., said, "The species is in trouble and it's headed on a trend
that could lead toward extinction."</TE>
<TE>   In November 2000, to settle a separate lawsuit, the wildlife
agency agreed to designate critical habitat by January 2001, Hogan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jewett disagreed with Hogan over Wednesday's lawsuit, saying her
agency had never agreed to a specific deadline. "Basically, we
contend that we are not in violation of the court order," she said.
"The court order never bound us to any specific date for designating
critical habitat."</TE>

<LD>Four environmental groups sued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on
Wednesday, arguing that the federal agency violated its promise to
protect waterways crucial to the Santa Ana sucker, a fish found in
four Southern California waterways.</LD>
<LD>   The American Fisheries Society, California Trout Inc., the Center
for Biological Diversity and Friends of the River filed the suit in
federal court in San Francisco. It alleges that the federal wildlife
agency violated a court-approved settlement that required it to act
by January 2001 to protect waterways crucial to the survival of the
threatened species.</LD>
<LD>   "The Bush administration's failure to protect this species' river
habitat flies in the face of conservation and our legal process,"
said David Hogan, rivers program coordinator for the Center for
Biological Diversity.</LD>
<TE>   The sucker, which uses its little mouth and large, thick lips to
vacuum algae and invertebrates from stream beds, used to be found in
clear creeks and bodies of water throughout the Southland. But
development, the paving of streams, competition from nonnative
species, water pollution and other factors have pushed it out of 75%

agency had never agreed to a specific deadline. "Basically, we
contend that we are not in violation of the court order," she said.
"The court order never bound us to any specific date for designating
critical habitat."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most controversial provisions of the Endangered Species
Act, critical habitat is a category of protected land in which
building and other activity can be limited or even barred to ensure
survival of rare plants and animals.</TE>
<TE>   The act requires that land or waterways essential to an imperiled
species' survival be protected when the creature is listed as
endangered or threatened. The wildlife service has long balked,
arguing that the process of delineating habitat is expensive and
time-consuming, and the designation affords little extra protection.</TE>
<TE>   But the courts have disagreed. Environmentalists have repeatedly
sued and won, resulting in court orders mandating hundreds of
critical habitat designations in the service's Pacific region alone.
Still, critical habitat has been designated for less than 12% of all
species listed as threatened or endangered, Hogan said.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the Bush administration has asked the courts to
invalidate several existing critical habitat designations, including
plans for the coastal California gnatcatcher and the San Diego fairy
shrimp.</TE>

<LD>Proving to teenagers that there is more to Los Angeles than meets the
eye is as simple as connecting the dots, an art group showed
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of continuation high school students teamed up with
professional artists to depict the city in a series of exhibits
unveiled at a downtown landmark--Grand Central Market.</LD>
<LD>   One group of San Fernando Valley youngsters used pointillism and
picnic plates to map a community that they are learning extends well
beyond their own neighborhood.</LD>
<TE>   "Our city looks good. The reality is different from what you see
on the news," said Fernando Ponce, 17, of Van Nuys. "On TV, the city
looks like a very sad place. But it really isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Ponce and pupils from continuation schools in Panorama City and
Van Nuys created a 10-foot map of Los Angeles using thousands of dots
to outline the city, its mountains and coastal areas and its network
of connecting roadways and transit routes. The small, colored dots
were made by rubber stamps carved from gum erasers.</TE>
<TE>   Wrapped around the map was a web of plastic picnic plates strung
together and draped over a vacant Grand Central Market food stand
commandeered for the students' exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   The 85-year-old market was picked for the weeklong exhibition
because of its historic role as Los Angeles' oldest open-air shopping
spot, said Cynthia Campoy Brophy, director of the HeArt Project. It
is a nonprofit program that for 10 years has conducted free arts
workshops at Los Angeles continuation schools. Those campuses offer
classroom instruction for teenagers who might otherwise drop out of
high school.</TE>
<TE>   Brophy's program operates on a $300,000-a-year budget financed by
grants and fund-raisers. Settings for students' previous work have
included art galleries, museums and libraries.</TE>
<TE>   Continuation students from Echo Park, Atwater Village, downtown
Los Angeles and North Hollywood produced exhibits Wednesday on the
Ambassador Hotel, the historic downtown district and youngsters'
vision of a futuristic Los Angeles. Many of the shoppers who filled
the market's sawdust-covered floors paused to study the work.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jan Perry and school district Board
of Education member Jose Huizar praised the teenagers. "Your view of
the community gives us all strength," Huizar said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica contemporary painter Carla Danes was one of the
professionals recruited by Brophy to help with the project. It was
Danes who had the Valley students pile onto the Red Line subway to
explore the city before creating their dot map.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time most of us had ever been on a train," said
Jose Gomez, 17, of Van Nuys. "L.A.'s bigger than I thought it was."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Truong, 16, also of Van Nuys, said the exercise was an
eye-opener on a smaller scale too, thanks to Danes and the
dot-making.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know what this was going to look like. But she kept
telling us that we're not making a map, we're making art. She was
right."</TE>

<LD>We'll try to ignore the wine and surfboards.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings have played with so much heart, committed to such
serious hockey that we'll allow them those California distractions.</LD>
<LD>   Check out the cuts, bruises and red marks. And that's just on the
coach.</LD>
<TE>   Notice their record in the last 45 games: 27-10-6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Listen to the whispers going around that no one wants to face them
in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Hear newcomer Cliff Ronning's impression of the team, one that
hasn't changed one bit since he joined the Kings in a trade last
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "They play with a lot of intensity and they come to play," Ronning
said. "It's good to be on a team that has that intensity."</TE>
<TE>   It's about the production of top players Jason Allison, Ziggy
Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh. It's about the effort of the Brad
Chartrand-Mikko Eloranta-Ian Laperriere line.</TE>
<TE>   It could be as simple as a meal. The players take turns buying
lunch, then sit around and eat together.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray believes this helps team unity.</TE>
<TE>   They took a rare break from the action after practice Wednesday to
autograph items for charity, and they received bottles of Cabernet
Sauvignon and Chardonnay for their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   They also had a chance to buy special surfboards that featured the
King logo and will be autographed by the players.</TE>
<TE>   So the Kings will be well prepared for a quiet evening at home or
a day at the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Not that they can expect much of either the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Consider their next three games at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   There's a showdown with Colorado tonight, and a victory would let
the Kings give serious thought to snatching the second-best record in
the Western Conference from the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's game against San Jose could be a showdown for first
place in the Pacific Division. Then again, by the time they return
from a four-game trip, their April 2 game against Vancouver could be
a fight for the eighth and final playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings seem to be better when there's so much at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easier to play games like that than it is when you're at
game 41," Laperriere said. "It's pressure. It's good pressure. It's
coming from the locker room. Guys want to make the playoffs, you've
got to do well. It's not pressure from the newspaper or pressure from
the coaches. It's good pressure."</TE>
<TE>   And it's old hat. Last year, on the verge of missing the playoffs,
the Kings went 11-2-5-2 in their last 20 games. That set up all the
great moments last spring, when they beat the Detroit Red Wings and
engaged the Avalanche in a seven-game fight.</TE>
<TE>   That all came into play at the beginning of the season, when the
Kings lost 13 of their first 19 games and looked ready to drop out of
playoff consideration by Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   So the Kings drew on their own experience.</TE>
<TE>   "They say that looking back should give you the ability to look
ahead," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to look back. We did it. That should show us we have the
ability to do it again."</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 17, the day they lost at Detroit and Murray called their
effort "an insult to every parent that's ever taken their kid to play
in a hockey game at 5:30 in the morning, like their parents did for
them", he also talked about the effort it would take to make the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We wrote on the board the number of wins we were going to have to
have and the winning percentage," Murray said. "They were a lot. We
said we would have to have 93 points. You would say, 'Jeez, those
numbers are tough.'</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that there was the run at the end of last year, it
allowed our guys to look ahead, because we were able to look back."</TE>
<TE>   At that point, he had said enough.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't talk to the team before its game the next day at
Minnesota. He let the captains handle that.</TE>
<TE>   They fought back from a deficit to tie the Wild that night. They
slowly got the season turned around.</TE>
<TE>   The players haven't used any excuses. They've fought through
injuries to Deadmarsh and Palffy.</TE>
<TE>   And those two Olympians, who could have slowed down after the
Winter Games, have been even stronger after they got back from Salt
Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh has eight goals and seven assists in the 11 games since
the Olympics. Palffy has five goals and eight assists in that
stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "To come back from an exciting tournament, like I was fortunate to
be a part of, I was really looking forward to coming back and going
on a good run with our team," Deadmarsh said. "We've had a lot of fun
so far."</TE>
<TE>   While the Olympians were having fun, Murray survived a faceoff
with death in a single-vehicle accident in Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   It's still chilling to hear him describe with vivid detail how his
truck swerved on the ice and tumbled down a hill.</TE>
<TE>   But it's encouraging to see him on skates--earlier than he was
supposed to--and directing practice from the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to sit and watch these practices," Murray said. "I
think you can coach better when you're going through the practices
with the guys."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody on this team is giving up. For the second year in a row,
neither did the front office.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, General Manager Dave Taylor hung in long enough to get
a good return for the inevitable departure of Rob Blake, who would
have left as a free agent if the Kings hadn't traded him for
Deadmarsh and Aaron Miller, along with picks and prospects.</TE>
<TE>   This year Taylor brought in Ronning for the stretch drive.</TE>
<TE>   Laperriere is quick to credit strength and conditioning coaches
Joeseph Horrigan and Dave Good, who design half-hour after-practice
programs for the players.</TE>
<TE>   That comes in addition to Murray's tough practices.</TE>
<TE>   "We go hard here," Allison said. "A lot of high-tempo stuff."</TE>
<TE>   It's no accident the Kings are tough at the end of games, tough at
the end of the season and looking ready to extend the season even

<DH>Pro basketball: After getting pounded by Spurs, 108-90,
they insist it won't matter in the playoffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>One of the great, humbling defeats of the Phil Jackson-Los Angeles
love affair raised two night crawler-sized veins on Rick Fox's shorn
head, from the tips of his eyebrows to the tops of his ears, and he's
a man of perspective.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal sat beside each other for the
entire fourth quarter at the Alamodome on Wednesday night, and they
hardly spoke while the sweat dried on their shoulders, and as the San
Antonio Spurs finished off the bottom half of their roster.</LD>
<LD>   If the Lakers are to win their third consecutive championship, it
appears it will have to come from this foothold, from a 108-90 defeat
that was much worse than that, 24 hours after a similar loss in
Dallas.</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, they forced reasoned opinions through suppressed
disappointment, through consecutive performances not worthy of all
they have done for more than two years. Fifteen regular-season games
remain, and they are 11/2 games behind the Sacramento Kings, leaders
of the Pacific Division and Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fighters," Bryant said. "We're fighters. We've been through
a lot of challenges. We've been through a lot of ups and downs. You
have to separate your emotion from the strategy of the game. That's
what we have to do right now."</TE>
<TE>   The Texas trip concluded 0-2. They lost, 114-98, on Tuesday,
because they fell out of step with their offense and their transition
defense was laborious. They played with the same frailties a night
later, so Tim Duncan scored 25 points in 29 minutes and Malik Rose
scored 19 in 21, and the Spurs led by 34 points three minutes into
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant shook a shooting slump with 20 points on nine-of-16
accuracy, but O'Neal made only two field goals and scored 13 of his
17 points at the free-throw line. The weary Lakers were swamped by
the rested Spurs, and so trailed by 13 points near the end of the
first quarter, and by 23 near the end of the second.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have given up at least 100 points in three consecutive
games, and in five of seven.</TE>
<TE>   As the Spurs trotted off the floor beneath the raucous cheers of
their fans and the fireworks from their rafters, there arose a
question of the gravity of such a singular victory. The Lakers swept
the Spurs in four games in last season's Western Conference finals,
beat them two more times since, and approached the last team to win
an NBA championship other than themselves with total competitive
clarity. Just as they had approached the Mavericks until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The conference playoff seeding is at stake. Playoff home games are
at stake. And, while that all seems critical, the Spurs had
home-court advantage in last year's series, and that translated into
two home losses for them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd venture to say it's not going to matter a bit when it comes
April," Jackson said. "But, you know, the Spurs have to feel better
about themselves playing us, that's for sure."</TE>
<TE>   A night after he pushed several starters to the end of a rout 250
miles north, Jackson coached a team with heavy legs and vacant
stares.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs hadn't played since a Saturday night victory over
Boston, so were fresh and eager as they extended their winning streak
to 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we played a good, aggressive game on defense," Spur
Coach Gregg Popovich said. "It allowed us to get in situations to
push the basketball. We moved it well."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers looked old and stiff, though Jackson started Samaki
Walker over Robert Horry at power forward in the hopes of handling
Duncan. Still, they had 20 turnovers, seven by Bryant, and Laker
starters, in 128 combined minutes, had one assist.</TE>
<TE>   "They just beat us to the ball," Jackson said. "We were not as
sharp as they were. Fatigue was a factor, yes, but they were quicker
to make plays than we were."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs looked like 1999, the year they swept the developing
Lakers in the playoffs and won their NBA title. After two quarters,
they had 16 assists on 23 field goals, and had 12 fastbreak points.
With about two minutes left in the third quarter, TNT went running
off to Denver, to Michael Jordan and the Washington Wizards, who
might give it an audience.</TE>
<TE>   "This was great for us," said Duncan, who had 19 points by
halftime. "Especially with the roll we are on, this really caps it
off. We played as well as we have for the entire streak here
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   We know this: If in the playoffs the Lakers have to play in San
Antonio the night after they play in Dallas, they might not
three-peat. Certainly, it will take them a while to get the stink of
these 26 hours off them, in a town where the local paper screamed,
"JUDGMENT DAY." But, they inhaled, and they clenched their jaws, and
they raised veins on their heads, and they spoke with the perspective
of springs when they won before.</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, that's what they had.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not that concerned at all," O'Neal said. "For us, it's all
about us. [Tuesday] night we let one slip away and tonight we came in
kind of flat."</TE>
<TE>   "There's still plenty of time. Like I said, it's all about us."</TE>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Fifteen years ago, the wisdom was scribbled on Luke Walton's lunch
bags.</LD>
<LD>   Every morning, he was sent to school with John Wooden at his side.</LD>
<LD>   On one bag, his father Bill would scrawl, "Be quick, but don't
hurry."</LD>
<TE>   On the next day's bag, he would write, "Failing to prepare is
preparing to fail."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, the wisdom was strapped to Luke Walton's back.</TE>
<TE>   Walking down a hallway at the Compaq Center here, when asked
whether he still listened to the Wizard's words, Luke opened a
knapsack and pulled out Wooden's latest</TE>
<TE>   book.</TE>
<TE>   "Have them right here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, the Pyramid of Success is not always a pyramid.
Sometimes it is a circle.</TE>
<TE>   Today, that circle continues to spin, quickly, but not hurriedly.</TE>
<TE>   With 91-year-old Wooden cheering from his Encino home, a
21-year-old protege will take the court for Arizona in the West
Regional semifinals against Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Luke Walton, the third son of one of Wooden's favorite sons,
playing as if he's being coached by Wooden himself.</TE>
<TE>   A tattooed kid responding to the tapping of a rolled-up program.</TE>
<TE>   Passing unselfishly. Defending devotedly. Hustling
unconditionally.</TE>
<TE>   After growing up on Wooden's preachings, Luke Walton now reminds
us how they once sounded.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-seven years after he coached his last game, the old man is
still coaching.</TE>
<TE>   Said Wooden: "I love watching Luke play."</TE>
<TE>   Said Walton: "Hearing that is like, really cool."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, it hurts.</TE>
<TE>   The current college player who most embodies the style of UCLA's
greatest coach is playing this week in the same Sweet 16 region as
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   But for a different team.</TE>
<TE>   The legacy of a much-celebrated, long-deceased UCLA system of
basketball is alive and well.</TE>
<TE>   And could make the jump shot that could beat UCLA in the regional
finals.</TE>
<TE>   "If Arizona plays UCLA, I can't lose," Wooden said.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, much has been written about Bill Walton's influence on
son Luke, the most valuable player of the Pacific 10 Conference
tournament and the first forward to lead the league in assists.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the similarities in the deep voice and childlike
smile, Walton did not raise his 6-foot-8 son in his own image.</TE>
<TE>   He raised him in John Wooden's image.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, it hurts.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad has called me 12 times in the last two days to recite John
Wooden quotes," Luke said Wednesday. "He'll recite them for five
minutes, hang up, and call 12 minutes later with some more."</TE>
<TE>   Why change now?</TE>
<TE>   "Our home is a shrine to Wooden's UCLA pyramid of success, and my
children have been raised that way," said Walton, the Bruin center
for two national championships and the 88-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Luke put it another way.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad is, like, a real Wooden freak," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When they stayed at their father's San Diego house--Bill and their
mother Susie divorced in 1989--they saw Wooden on the coffee table,
Wooden in the kitchen, Wooden in the bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   There was even Wooden in their feet.</TE>
<TE>   "I took my children to his house so Coach could teach them to put
on socks and shoes the right way, so they could prevent blisters,"
Bill said.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, Wooden on their lunch bags.</TE>
<TE>   "After a while, he'd start writing real obscure sayings, and kids
at school would say, 'What is it with those lunch bags?'" recalled
son Nate, a former Princeton star who now works on Wall Street. "Of
course, the most amazing thing is that he made our lunches."</TE>
<TE>   All four Walton boys played college basketball, including oldest
son Adam at Louisiana State and College of Notre Dame in Belmont,
Calif.; and youngest son Chris, currently at San Diego State.</TE>
<TE>   When the kids would play two-on-two basketball in the driveway,
they would play Wooden style. When they would go to the recreation
center and see everyone running and gunning, they would return to the
driveway.</TE>
<TE>   While other kids just pretended to be Larry Bird, they would play
with him.</TE>
<TE>   Their father's visiting Boston Celtic teammate would score the
first 10 points of 11-point games, then keep passing the ball until
one of the Walton children scored the game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   "Then he would spend the rest of the day trash-talking," Luke
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a lesson in unselfishness they never forgot.</TE>
<TE>   "I've read where Lute Olson says that Luke's playing style comes
from his genes," said Nate, referring to a common quote from the
Arizona coach. "Well, I'd like to see the gene that has anything to
do with passing the basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not genetic; it's environmental."</TE>
<TE>   Luke grew up learning that passing was equal to shooting, that
vision was more critical than speed, that teamwork was more important
than anything.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see that his whole philosophy on the court is about
helping others," Wooden said. "That makes me very happy."</TE>
<TE>   It could have made UCLA very happy. In fact, Steve Lavin recruited
Walton out of San Diego's University High, even driving down and
joining the family for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Walton was unimpressed, but he never even returned the
visit.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to Arizona because I felt it was the best school for me,"
Luke said. "If I had gone to UCLA, it would have been because I
thought that was the best school."</TE>
<TE>   Can you imagine Walton's popularity if he had followed his father
and mentor? Can you imagine the Bruins' record?</TE>
<TE>   On this season's team of shooters, can you imagine him essentially
filling the role of that missing point guard?</TE>
<TE>   This was Lavin's biggest recruiting loss.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Walton, whose personal style is a direct opposite of Lavin's
style, said he had nothing to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   "I made it clear to all my sons, their life is not my life," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wooden said whatever happened, he is disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been really nice to have Luke here, but I respect
that Bill lets them make their own decisions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if that means making a choice to have a drawing of four
dancing, basketball-spinning skeletons on his right arm.</TE>
<TE>   Wooden and Bill Walton blanched a couple of years ago when Luke
showed up on TV with that tattoo.</TE>
<TE>   Said Wooden: "I still can't understand why kids today want to do
that to themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bill: "I called Luke and said, 'What, have they run out of
soap in Tucson?'"</TE>
<TE>   Luke showed off the skeletons Wednesday--they are a combination
tribute to the four Waltons and the Grateful Dead--and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just who I am," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sound familiar?</TE>
<TE>   Wooden has heard it before.</TE>
<TE>   He embraces it still.</TE>
<TE>   Said Wooden: "More than any of the other children, Luke's playing
style reminds me of his father."</TE>
<TE>   Said Luke: "Wow. I've never heard him say that before."</TE>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>There's the good boy-bad boy Kareem and JaRon Rush chronicles.</LD>
<LD>   The slick-backed Steve Lavin vs. curl-coifed Quin Snyder follicle
follies.</LD>
<LD>   The en garde point guard reunion of Wesley Stokes and Cedric
Bozeman.</LD>
<TE>   The resurrection of the seven-year-old Bruin-saving, Tiger-taming
Tyus Edney layup.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and there's the game.</TE>
<TE>   No. 8-seeded UCLA will face No. 12 Missouri tonight in a West
Regional Sweet 16 matchup at Compaq Center thick with subplots that
merely aggravate those trying to prepare for the biggest game of
their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I'd have to endure a week of hair jokes," said Snyder, the
Missouri coach. "I knew there are so many similarities and external
things everyone would ask about that it would be a challenge to keep
our focus."</TE>
<TE>   The 40 minutes of basketball should be captivating on its own
merits. Both teams are here unexpectedly, yet both are considered
among the most talented in the country.</TE>
<TE>   And their seasons are eerily similar.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (21-11) climbed to a No. 3 ranking a week into the season,
had an early nine-game winning streak, then stumbled through two
months of one win-one loss weekends, eventually losing nine of the
last 17 games, including in the first round of the Pacific 10
Conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Bruins did an about-face in the NCAA tournament, burying
Mississippi by 22 points and knocking off No. 1-seeded Cincinnati in
double overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri (23-11) won its first nine, climbed to a No. 2 ranking,
then lost three in a row. A 6-3 January was followed by a 5-3
February and two losses in three games the first week of March,
including in the second round of the Big 12 Conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Tigers became ferocious, opening the NCAA tournament with
a 13-point victory over No. 5-seeded Miami and beating No. 4 Ohio
State by 16.</TE>
<TE>   Another similarity: San Francisco executive Bill Walsh spoke to
both teams Wednesday, ensuring that he will have inspired the
winners.</TE>
<TE>   Said Missouri guard Clarence Gilbert: "He sounded like Coach
Snyder, saying it's about us, the guys wearing the uniforms, that you
need to fight for the guy next to you."</TE>
<TE>   Said UCLA guard Rico Hines: "He told us that we're playing great
basketball at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins will be without Hines, though, who injured his knee in
the victory over Cincinnati and will not play. His defensive prowess
on the perimeter will be missed because Missouri has two of the
nation's top three-point threats.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert, a 6-foot-2 senior, averages nearly nine three-point
attempts a game and has launched 801 shots from the arc in the last
three seasons, making 303.</TE>
<TE>   Kareem Rush, whose troubled brother JaRon played at UCLA for two
seasons, is another long-range weapon, having made 105 of 260
three-pointers. However, the 6-6 junior forward and NBA prospect has
a well-rounded game that will test whoever is guarding him.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kapono might begin the game defending against Rush, but 6-7
freshman reserve Dijon Thompson might be best suited to containing
him. Thompson, who played very well in the first two rounds, could
play more than 20 minutes in Hines' absence.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA will have difficulty playing zone defense because of the
Tigers' three-point shooting ability. Employing a press or a pressure
man-to-man could be effective because Missouri committed at least 14
turnovers 20 times.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes, a former AAU teammate of Bozeman who plays significant
minutes at the point when Gilbert moves to shooting guard, is
especially turnover-prone, although he has handled the ball better of
late.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about Wesley, he's playing his best basketball of
the season," Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   The primary concern of both coaches is that their players become
intoxicated by the sudden barrage of fawning media--the same media
that blasted them during their months of mediocrity.</TE>
<TE>   "The real challenge for our team, now that everyone is patting
them on the back and talking about what a great run we're having, is
to just get back to practice and concentrate on game preparation,"
Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether two victories qualify as a run is open to interpretation,
although the triumphs at Pittsburgh did mark the first time in 10
weeks the Bruins won two games in the same weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Like his players, Lavin is getting some uncustomary kudos. And he
is reveling in the opportunity to reshape his image.</TE>
<TE>   "Contrary to popular opinion, we don't play dodgeball, steal the
flag, red light green light, hopscotch and other grammar school games
at practice," he said. "We actually teach fundamentals and coach. As
a result you see the breakthroughs, like freshmen Ryan Walcott and
Cedric Bozeman improving."</TE>
<TE>   At 35, Snyder is two years younger than Lavin. The former Duke
assistant enjoyed a two-year honeymoon period at Missouri but was
criticized when the Tigers did a free-fall from the rankings in
January and had a 12-11 finish to the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "I do have empathy for [Lavin]," Snyder said. "The key for me was

be at my best when there is chaos and adversity."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA often performs best under those very circumstances. Perhaps
the most intriguing subplot for today's game is whether these teams
can play well now that everything is going so smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking we're going to keep rolling," Kapono said. "That
Cincinnati victory ought to lead to something special."</TE>

<HD>3 Teenagers Killed in Crash at Intersection</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Man is arrested on suspicion of drunk driving
after collision in Huntington Beach.</DH>

<LD>Three friends who had gone out for coffee were fatally injured early
Wednesday when a driver ran a red light and slammed into their car in
a Huntington Beach intersection.</LD>
<LD>   Jillian Baedeker, 19, and Nancy Le, 18, died at the scene. Chelsea
Toma, 19, died about eight hours later at UC Irvine Medical Center in
Orange, police said.</LD>
<LD>   All three were from Huntington Beach and had been classmates at
Marina High School.</LD>
<TE>   Police arrested James Paul Bell Jr., 27, of Rowland Heights on
suspicion of felony drunk driving.</TE>
<TE>   Bell was also taken to UC Irvine Medical Center, where he was
reported in critical condition Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Baedeker, who was driving, was the daughter of Rick Baedeker,
president of Hollywood Park since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The family publishes Baedeker's Guide, a professional handicapping
journal sold at racetracks in California.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically everyone's in shock and disbelief," said Mike Mooney, a
spokesman for the racetrack. Family members said the women had gone
out for coffee and were within a mile of Baedeker's home when the
accident happened just after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Gary Meza, a spokesman for the Huntington Beach Police
Department, said Bell, driving north on Beach Boulevard, ran a red
light at Edinger Street and broadsided Baedeker's car, which was
traveling west through the intersection.</TE>
<TE>   After hitting the victims, Meza said, the car struck a second
vehicle stopped at the light, slightly injuring its two occupants.
Both were treated at a hospital and released.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a witness who said [Bell] was driving erratically and had
gone through another red light before the accident," Meza said. "We
don't know whether he was chasing someone, being chased by somebody
else or just driving like a maniac."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles said
Wednesday that Bell had two recent citations: the first in 1999 for
entering an intersection in West Covina "without sufficient space to
clear it," the second in 2000 for making an illegal U-turn.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking witnesses to the crash, police held a news conference
Wednesday at which they displayed the mangled cars. Police were also
planning to hand out leaflets at the scene of the crash.</TE>
<TE>   An impromptu shrine at the intersection drew friends and relatives
of the three women, including Baedeker's mother, Claudia, who wept as
she spoke.</TE>
<TE>   Among the flowers, candles and mementos was Toma's nametag from
Huntington Surf and Sport, where she worked part-time between classes
at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievably sad," said Brandon Ward, 22, a manager at the
store who had known her for about a year.</TE>
<TE>   "She was beautiful, really sweet--a fun girl to be around. Her
attitude was really awesome. I'm pretty sick to my stomach about the
whole thing."</TE>

<HD>Hells Angels Case Result Leaves Some Questioning Value</HD>
<DH>Courts: The effect of the convictions on the flow of drugs
in Ventura County is debated. Costs from the five-year prosecution
continue to mount.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Ventura County law enforcement officials hailed the drug-sale
convictions of national Hells Angels leader George Christie Jr. and
his associates, defense lawyers questioned Wednesday whether the
criminal case and its end result were worth the hefty cost.</LD>
<LD>   The district attorney's office spent five years building a
drug-and-racketeering case against Christie and two dozen members and
associates of his motorcycle club.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation culminated last year with indictments against 28
defendants, all but seven of whom have pleaded guilty or no contest,
or have seen their cases dismissed.</LD>
<TE>   Christie, 54, joined the list Tuesday, pleading guilty to
conspiracy to sell prescription drugs and no contest to filing a
false tax return. His ex-wife, Cheryl, and their 25-year-old son also
entered guilty pleas after cutting deals that will result in the
dismissal of most of the counts against them.</TE>
<TE>   Sentencing for the Christies is set for April 17. Prosecutors said
Wednesday they will argue for the maximum seven-year prison sentence
for George Christie Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "An organization responsible for dealing drugs in our community
has been largely dismantled," said Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury, who
credited his prosecution team for bringing the case to a successful
conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   But defense lawyers question whether the case has significantly
stemmed the flow of drugs into Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like throwing marshmallows at a tank," said attorney Victor
Salas, who formerly represented Cheryl Christie. "There has not been
any slowdown in the amount of dope cases being filed. They didn't do
anything to stop the activities that they wanted to stop."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the cost of the case continues to mount. So far, the
county has spent about $925,000 in defense-related expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "And remember we are not through," said Larry Morris, a county
budget analyst. "We still have billings that are going to come in. I
don't know what the total amount is going to be."</TE>
<TE>   Those costs do not include the amount spent by the public
defender's office, which represented one defendant, nor the costs
accrued by Conflict Defense Associates, an indigent-defense group
that represented five defendants.</TE>
<TE>   The price tag also doesn't include the criminal investigation or
the salaries of four deputy district attorneys and three
investigators assigned to the case.</TE>
<TE>   Several defense lawyers estimated the final bill for the Hells
Angels case will exceed $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we getting our bang for our buck?" questioned Chief Deputy
Public Defender Michael McMahon. "We have limited resources and I
sometimes fear we throw an inordinate amount at a handful of cases."</TE>
<TE>   Salas suggested that the money would have been better spent on
drug treatment programs.</TE>
<TE>   "But on the other hand," he said, "if it means the Vicodin won't
hit the high schools, then it was worth the money."</TE>
<TE>   The elder Christie was accused of running a narcotics ring that
stole prescription drugs from a Los Angeles Air Force base and sold
them to young adults, including high school students on two campuses
in Ojai and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, an airman at the base, Joshua Adams,
stole more than 297,000 Vicodin tablets and 466,000 Diazepam tablets,
commonly known as Valium, between 1997 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Those stolen drugs were sold out of Christie's Main Street tattoo
parlor and the Angels clubhouse in west Ventura, prosecutors alleged.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, Adams admitted to funneling the drugs to
Rogelio Botello, a 25-year-old Ventura resident, who last week
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to sell drugs to minors.</TE>
<TE>   On at least one occasion, Botello and Adams delivered hundreds of
bottles of stolen Vicodin tablets directly to George Christie's
house, prosecutors allege in a written motion filed in the case last
fall.</TE>

pleaded guilty to conspiracy to sell drugs to minors.</TE>
<TE>   On at least one occasion, Botello and Adams delivered hundreds of
bottles of stolen Vicodin tablets directly to George Christie's
house, prosecutors allege in a written motion filed in the case last
fall.</TE>
<TE>   A former Hells Angels member told the grand jury that Christie
directed the sale of the pharmaceuticals.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors also alleged that Christie's son was a key figure
in the drug sales scheme.</TE>
<TE>   "George Christie III is at the heart of the conspiracy,"
prosecutors wrote in the motion. "Indeed, it was his friendship with
Rogelio Botello which established the connection between the supply
of Vicodin ES ... and the Hells Angels."</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Bennett said the investigation
stopped those tablets from hitting the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigation through its conclusion in late 1999 virtually
eliminated a source of pharmaceutical narcotic drugs," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the price tag, defense lawyers questioned whether
prosecutors had a vendetta against the elder Christie and abused
their power by seeking indictments against his entire family.</TE>
<TE>   Christie drew the ire of local law enforcement officials when in
1998 he hosted a 50th anniversary reunion of the motorcycle club,
which culminated with a group photo on the steps of Ventura City Hall
that ran in several newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Cheryl Christie and son George Christie III,
daughter Moriya Christie and her husband, Layne Bell, were charged
with conspiracy and grand theft for allegedly making a false
statement on a loan document when purchasing a second home five years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged the couple never intended to live in the
Ventura house and lied on financial documents to get a lower interest
rate, indicating the property would be their primary residence.</TE>
<TE>   In December, prosecutors dismissed the conspiracy charge and
reduced the grand theft count to a misdemeanor, which was stayed by a
judge.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys August Bresia and James DiFrank argued in court
papers that the couple were unfairly swept up in the investigation
targeting George Christie Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Salas suggested the same was true for his former client.</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason they pulled in Cheryl Christie was to use as
leverage to get a plea out of George Christie," he said. "I can't
think of any other reason."</TE>

<HD>Political Corruption Investigated in Bell Gardens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities launched a political corruption investigation Wednesday
in Bell Gardens after officials expressed concern that public funds
were being used for political purposes.</LD>
<LD>   Several council members and City Clerk Ronald Hart were questioned
at City Hall by investigators from the district attorney's public
integrity unit. Investigators also searched boxes of documents from
the clerk's office that are being held by the Bell Gardens Police
Department. The district attorney's office does not comment on
pending investigations.</LD>
<LD>   According to city officials, the investigation focuses on the city
clerk's purchase of customized lists of registered voters--lists
often used by politicians for sending out campaign mailers.</LD>
<TE>   The Political Reform Act prohibits the use of public funds for
mass mailings from politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Hart said Wednesday that he ordered the material upon a request
from Councilman Salvador Franco. Hart said that he had done nothing
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I do what council tells me to, unless I think it's illegal," he
said. "I didn't think it was illegal, so I did it."</TE>
<TE>   Franco did not return telephone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Other city officials, including Mayor Ramiro Morales, said they
think the purchase amounts to a misuse of public funds. They said
they were also alarmed to see Hart carrying two boxes from his
offices this week.</TE>
<TE>   The boxes, along with two portable voting booths, were retrieved
by the Police Department from Hart's El Segundo home, according to
Police Chief Manuel Ortega.</TE>
<TE>   Hart acknowledged removing some items from his office, but
declined to elaborate, saying it was unrelated to the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's actions by the district attorney's office follow last
year's arrest of Councilwoman Maria Chacon on conflict-of-interest
charges. Prosecutors allege that she pressured fellow members to vote
for her appointment as city manager. That case has yet to go to
trial.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to improve the city's image, officials over the last
year fired Chacon and bolstered the hiring standards for city
manager. But this week's revelations, the mayor and other officials
say, suggest that problems persist at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Officials noticed the purchase of the mailing lists during a
routine review of check warrants. The $3,000 invoice went to a
Downey-based company that performs computer processing work.</TE>
<TE>   According to Hart, Franco wanted a list of registered voters
sorted by birth date so that he could send birthday cards to
residents.</TE>
<TE>   Birthday card mailers are occasionally used by politicians as a
way to build name recognition. Authorities took action in response to
a report from Ortega, who is also the city's acting city manager.</TE>

<HD>Infant Dead, Mother Comatose</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police say she apparently killed the child, then
slashed her wrists and overdosed.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 15-month-old Long Beach girl died mysteriously and her mother was
found unconscious after slashing her wrists and taking a drug
overdose in an apparent murder and attempted-suicide case, Long Beach
police said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Homicide Officer David Marander said an autopsy would be performed
on Isabella Dora Sanford, and that the cause of her death was not
readily apparent, but that she too might have had a drug overdose.</LD>
<LD>   Charges against the girl's mother, Angelica Sanford, 29, would
await determination of her condition if and when she recovered, the
officer said. Sanford was comatose Wednesday afternoon, and it is
possible the drugs she took could have caused brain damage, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The girl and her mother were discovered unconscious in the
bathroom by the girl's father, whose name was not released, when he
arrived home from work Tuesday night, Marander said.</TE>
<TE>   The baby was taken to St. Mary Medical Center for treatment, but
she was pronounced dead soon after arriving.</TE>
<TE>   Marander urged anyone with information to call police at (562)
570-7244. "There is quite a bit about this that we don't know," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors created an impromptu memorial Wednesday outside the
family home in the 4600 block of East 15th Street. Some said they
knew the mother and child, and had not noticed anything wrong.</TE>

<HD>Girl, 16, Gets Life for Slaying</HD>
<DH>Crime: In sentencing Rialto teen, judge cites report that
described her as a monster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Echoing a Probation Department report that called 16-year-old Christy
Phillips a monster who needed to be kept from society, a judge
sentenced the Rialto teenager Wednesday to two consecutive life
sentences for bludgeoning to death an elderly neighbor with an ax and
pipe wrench two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "It gives me no great pleasure to do what I'm about to do,"
Fontana Superior Court Judge James Skropos said just before handing
down the life sentence terms. "But for the protection and safety of
this community, I have to."</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday's sentence marks the second time this week that San
Bernardino prosecutors won a life sentence against a teenage
defendant. On Tuesday, a Rancho Cucamonga judge sentenced 17-year-old
Paul Yum to 40 years in prison for the 1999 shooting deaths of his
mother and sister. At the time of the killing, Yum was 14.</LD>
<TE>   John Kochis, chief deputy district attorney in San Bernardino,
said the shocking crimes of teenagers, and the harsh penalties they
bring, are not as rare as people in the community think.</TE>
<TE>   "There have always been juveniles, like adults, who commit these
terrible crimes," said Kochis. "And when we obtain these convictions,
judges, more often than not, make the punishments fit the crime."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Phillips' defense attorney made a passionate plea to
Skropos, pleading with him not to accept a Probation Department
report's harsh words about the teenager. He took particular exception
to a portion of the report that called Phillips a monster.</TE>
<TE>   "Webster's dictionary defines monster as inhumanly cruel and
wicked," the report said. "By definition, Christy Phillips is a
monster."</TE>
<TE>   "My client is no monster," Supervising Deputy Public Defender John
Crouch said. "She is a girl, a young girl. And although she was
physically 15 [at the time of the murder], she is mentally and
emotionally much younger than that."</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Joanne Uhlman countered that the girl took
"sick, sadistic pleasure" in what was nothing more than a thrill
killing for a bored teenager.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, Phillips and a 13-year-old friend talked
their way into the Rialto home of 72-year-old Manuela "Nellie" Fyock
in July 2000, saying they wanted to adopt one of the woman's more
than 20 cats.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside the home, according to a confession Phillips later
gave detectives, she turned to her younger friend and asked: "What do
you think? Should I kill this lady?"</TE>
<TE>   In her description of the crime, Phillips said she first struck
Fyock, who used a walker to get around, over the head with a wood
splitter. She then alternately beat the woman with an ax, a pipe
wrench and a lug wrench. Phillips left and returned to Fyock's home
twice. She wanted to make sure Fyock was dead, Phillips told
investigators. Before leaving a final time, Phillips spit on the
blood-soaked body.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips later told her younger friend's mother about the killing,
prompting her to call the police.</TE>
<TE>   At her trial, Phillips recanted her confession and said it was the
younger girl who bludgeoned the woman to death. The confession, she
said, was out of loyalty to a friend she wanted to protect. But
jurors did not buy that explanation and found the girl guilty of
first-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   The slaying horrified and outraged the community surrounding the
modest home on East Easton Avenue, where Fyock lived for more than 30
years. The front porch to her home, now just a shack with broken and
boarded- up windows, is still littered with the rosary beads and
flower vases placed there in the days after the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Abraham Wilson said he knew Fyock. And he used to see
Phillips and her 13-year-old friend playing in the street near his
home.</TE>
<TE>   "They just seemed so polite, so nice," Wilson said. "And I just
didn't know what to think when it happened. Kids are smiling at you
one day, and the next thing you know they've killed somebody."</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought, 'Why?'" neighbor Imelda Gomez said. "Why take it
out on this poor woman, who had nothing to do with this kid and
whatever problems she was having? I don't care how young she is or
what her circumstances were, she had no right to go around killing a
defenseless woman like that."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Grace Vargas said the crime put the city even more on guard.
"There was just such a lack of value for this woman," Vargas said.
"Something like this shouldn't happen here or anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   But Phillips' older sister said the Christy Phillips most people
have learned about through news accounts is simply not the kid sister
she grew up with.</TE>
<TE>   "The way people have described her," said Shealonda Phillips, 24.
"They didn't know the Christy we knew."</TE>
<TE>   Shealonda Phillips, a clerk for the county with plans to attend
the University of Redlands, said she and her four siblings had a
rough life. According to court records, their father was an abusive
man who beat his children and locked them up in a room for hours at a
time, not even allowing time to come out and use the bathroom.
Instead, they were given diapers. He left the family years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "But Christy, she used to laugh. ... She had goals," Phillips
said. "She was a good person."</TE>

<HD>Davis, Simon Spar Over Abortion, Energy, Guns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis and his Republican challenger, Bill Simon, engaged in
early campaign jousting Wednesday, with Davis insisting that voters
are keenly interested in Simon's views on abortion and gun control,
while Simon homed in on the governor's handling of the energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Davis also employed the power of incumbency, announcing that armed
California Highway Patrol officers now are providing an added measure
of security on intrastate commercial airline flights. California is
the first state to use police on flights originating and ending
within its borders.</LD>
<LD>   "This is another signal to the traveling public in California that
we are determined to do everything possible to keep them safe," Davis
said at one of two news conferences he held Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The plainclothes officers will provide added security whenever
their duties require them to travel aboard Southwest Airlines, United
Air Lines and America West Airlines flights. CHP Commissioner D.O.
"Spike" Helmick said that as part of the eight hours of special
training, the officers received instruction on firing guns on
airplanes, although, he said, "that would be a last resort."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who also appeared at an event honoring agriculture, picked
up endorsements from two agricultural groups, while Simon met with
other Republicans running for statewide office on the November
ballot. He tried to demonstrate that he is unifying the California
Republican Party by appearing at a news conference across from the
Capitol and later at a fund-raiser with Republican National Committee
chairman Marc Racicot.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Simon at the news conference was Gerald Parsky, a top
advisor to President Bush in California who had been outspoken in his
support for former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, defeated by
Simon in the primary election this month.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is fully supportive of Bill Simon's campaign and
the entire ticket," Parsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly we had a lot of direct, very candid discussions
throughout the course of primary season. But that is history, quite
frankly," Racicot said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush plans to visit California next month to campaign for Simon,
and Racicot vowed that the GOP will provide the businessman from
Pacific Palisades with whatever help he needs.</TE>
<TE>   Simon answered a question about energy deregulation by criticizing
Davis for signing long-term contracts with independent energy
producers to supply electricity at a cost of more than $40 billion
over the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   "His first and foremost responsibility is renegotiating those
contracts," Simon said, adding that the prices are more than double
the current cost of electricity. Davis is trying to renegotiate the
deals.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also would not discuss his opposition to abortion, except to
say: "I've made my views on abortion very clear."</TE>
<TE>   "Abortion will not be the centerpiece of my agenda," Simon said.
"What I want to choose to talk about at much greater length are these
issues: the economy, our schools, our roads and our power."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who convened news conferences before and after Simon's
public appearance, said, "It really doesn't matter what Bill Simon
wants to talk about, or what Gray Davis wants to talk about. The
public in this state owns this election. They're entitled to hear
about any issue of importance to them. If Mr. Simon says he'll change
the subject when issues come up that he is uncomfortable with, the
public doesn't let you do that."</TE>
<TE>   Davis cited his differences with Simon on what he sees as key
issues: "I'm strongly pro-choice. Mr. Simon is firmly anti-choice. I
believe in reasonable gun control. Mr. Simon got an 'A' from the
National Rifle Assn."</TE>

<HD>Dog Survives Ordeal</HD>
<DH>Crime: Driver who dragged pup is sought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUBURN, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A dog dragged behind a pickup truck along a country road is winning
the hearts of Placer County residents, and has inspired a $5,000
reward for its assailants' arrest.</LD>
<LD>   County officials say the young male Australian shepherd
crossbreed, which nearly choked to death with a cord tied around his
neck, is recovering at the county's animal services facility.</LD>
<LD>   The dog, dubbed Raspberry for his numerous scrapes, has prompted
several offers of adoption, as well as reward donations of $2,500
from the Humane Society of the United States and $1,000 from
Crimestoppers.</LD>
<TE>   Facility manager Richard Ward said area residents have also
donated amounts from $50 to $200 to the reward fund. One woman
offered to pay the dog's veterinary bill, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Gaffaney, a Loomis veterinarian who treated the dog for
broken teeth, cuts, bruises and a nose burn, said, "He was pretty
lucky, and he'll make some family happy."</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies, meanwhile, continued their search for the
pickup's driver. Witnesses said a passenger in the back of the beige
Toyota pickup wore a beige hunting jacket and bluejeans.</TE>
<TE>   "The poor dog could stand, but he was very wobbly," said Sheriff's
Deputy Mike Bell, who found the dog last Thursday near Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite what happened to him, he was wagging his tail as if to
say, 'Thank you for caring for me,'" Bell said.</TE>

<HD>Lockyer Pushes Power Cost Refunds With FERC</HD>
<DH>Energy: Attorney general seeks up to $2.8 billion in
repayments from suppliers, saying they withheld rate data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>California officials on Wednesday stepped up their efforts to
persuade federal regulators to order refunds for electricity bought
during the state's power crisis, intensifying a debate that has
political as well as financial overtones.</LD>
<LD>   State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer filed a petition with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission seeking $1.8 billion to $2.8
billion--and perhaps substantially more--in refunds. A state request
for $8.9 billion in refunds is already pending before federal
regulators.</LD>
<LD>   The new demand is the latest twist in an energy crisis that has
eased at the light switch but remains a hotly debated subject in
California's gubernatorial campaign. The state's troubles last year,
along with the collapse of energy giant Enron Corp., have fueled a
new investigation to determine whether companies used their market
power to drive up electricity prices last year and have intensified a
debate in Congress over new rules for energy markets.</LD>
<TE>   In his complaint to FERC, Lockyer employs a novel legal theory: He
contends that electricity wholesalers failed to file the required
information about the rates they planned to charge so that regulators
could determine whether those rates were just and reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   "The power companies have not filed any of their market-based
rates, making every sale illegal and subject to review and refund for
excessive charges," Lockyer told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Dynegy, one of the power suppliers named in the
complaint, said, "We've always abided by what FERC has requested."</TE>
<TE>   "This comes at a time when we should be focusing on the future,
working together to develop a long-term solution for California's
power issues," spokesman David Byford added.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer is seeking an additional $1.8 billion to $2.8 billion in
refunds for alleged overcharges from May through October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He also contends that the state is due an unspecified larger
amount for electricity bought on the spot market by the Department of
Water Resources from January through October 2001. The department
spent an estimated $10 billion for power during that period.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint seeks refunds from British Columbia Power Exchange,
Coral Power, Dynegy Power Marketing, Mirant Americas Energy
Marketing, Reliant Energy Services, Williams Energy Marketing and
Trading, and Enron Power Marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Last week Lockyer filed complaints against four large energy firms
for $150 million, alleging that they broke contracts to provide
emergency power to the state's power grid operator and instead sold
the electricity on the lucrative spot market. The state also is
asking regulators to void or modify $43 billion in long-term power
contracts signed by the state at the height of the power crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators also are conducting an investigation, requested
by California's senators, to determine whether any companies used
their market power to drive up electricity prices in the West last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer also hinted that he would take action today in Los Angeles
relating to municipal power authorities.</TE>

<LD>A Van Nuys man has been charged with leaving an accident and evading
officers in connection with a police chase that ended with an elderly
couple being struck and seriously injured outside the Beverly Center,
according to the district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Tremine Tillman, 23, of Van Nuys is scheduled for arraignment
April 9. He is being held in County Jail on $250,000 bond.</LD>
<LD>   The injured couple, Anna Polivoda, 76, and her husband, Henry, 79,
were taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Saturday after a car
struck them as they crossed a street near the mall.</LD>
<TE>   Anna Polivoda suffered a head injury, a broken leg and a broken
thumb. Her husband suffered a broken leg and a severe concussion,
according to a family member. Their daughter, Stephany Yablow, said
Tuesday that her parents, both of whom survived the Holocaust in
Poland, are expected to remain in the hospital for at least two weeks
before being transferred to a convalescent facility.</TE>
<TE>   Police have said officers initiated the pursuit near La Brea
Avenue and Washington Boulevard because the car registration did not
match the license plate sticker.</TE>

<HD>Geographers' World View Evolves From Mere Facts to Thorny
Politics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These days, geography is about a lot more than state capitals and
annual rainfall.</LD>
<LD>   It's also about offshore banking, crime analysis, labor markets
and Middle East politics. At least, those are the many topics
addressed by the Assn. of American Geographers, which is holding its
annual meeting this week in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very broad. Geography goes back to when people didn't know a
lot about the Earth and needed to map it. Then geography broke off
from that," said Barry Solomon, an associate professor at Michigan
Technological University.</LD>
<TE>   Manoela Borges, a teacher's assistant at the University of
Colorado in Boulder, said it's hard to explain to students who aren't
geography majors why they're studying capitalism and welfare systems.</TE>
<TE>   "They say, 'This is not geography.' Well, it is," Borges said.
"It's really multidisciplinary."</TE>
<TE>   Definitions vary, but they do cover a wide range. "It's why things
happen where they happen," one conference participant said. "It is
'What is where?' and 'Why?' and 'What about?'" another said.</TE>
<TE>   Geography also crosses over into politics, some attendees said.
The word "geography" was barely mentioned in Indiana State University
professor Mohameden Ould-Mey's lecture Wednesday during a session
titled "The Middle East Today." His topic was the more political
subject of Zionism.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel has two options: Allow Palestinians to be citizens and
vote in elections like South Africans, or continue to be Zionists and
remain exclusively Jewish," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though some questioned his point of view, few disputed that the
debate was centered in geography. As the discipline matures,
attendees said, simple facts of place and space don't satisfy the
geographer's curiosity; they must be subjected to analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israel-Palestine conflict is classic geography," said Zoltan
Grossman, a doctoral student at the University of Wisconsin in
Madison. "It's based in place."</TE>
<TE>   The 98th annual meeting, caught even the attention of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center. Rabbi Abraham Cooper, its associate dean, sent a
letter to the association expressing disappointment with papers
delivered that he thought were anti-Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "In this particular environment that we're dealing with--while the
holy land is burning--this is irresponsible and arrogant," Cooper
said. "What this has to do with geography, I'm not sure."</TE>
<TE>   Ould-Mey said the Arab-Israeli conflict is "the most important
geographic topic because it involves the whole world."</TE>

<HD>Former Church Elder Held in Molestation</HD>
<DH>Crime: Fullerton Sunday school teacher admitted guilt in
'92 but couldn't be prosecuted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD and MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An 86-year-old former church elder, who a decade ago was banished
from one of Orange County's largest churches after admitting to
molesting young girls but never faced criminal prosecution, was
arrested Wednesday on a single count of child molestation.</LD>
<LD>   James Campbell Truxton was forced in 1992 to leave Fullerton's
First Evangelical Free Church in disgrace when several women came
forward to say that the Sunday school teacher had molested them when
they were children.</LD>
<LD>   Truxton publicly admitted that the accusations were true and set
up a $30,000 trust fund to help pay for counseling for his victims,
authorities said. Police said at least a dozen women received money
from the fund from 1992 to 1994, though detectives believe as many as
25 girls were sexually abused by him.</LD>
<TE>   Truxton was not prosecuted at the time because the alleged
molestations--some dating to the 1950s--occurred after the six-year
statute of limitations expired. But California law has since been
changed to allow prosecutors to sidestep the statute in child
molestation cases when victims come forward for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The new law opened the door for investigators to launch another
probe of Truxton eight months ago, when a former member of the church
telephoned Fullerton police to ask if they were still investigating
the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators reopened the case and in December contacted another
woman who attended the Fullerton church as a girl. Now 29, the
unidentified woman told detectives that when she was between 7 and 9,
Truxton sexually abused her at his home, where he taught Sunday
school classes and his wife taught piano lessons.</TE>
<TE>   The report gave prosecutors enough evidence to file a felony
charge against Truxton on Wednesday, accusing him of committing oral
copulation on a child between Jan. 1, 1978, and Dec. 31, 1981.</TE>
<TE>   He faces a maximum of seven years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   "There is built-in trust between parents, children and the clergy,
where parents think that nothing like this is going to happen in
church-type settings. But it does," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Randy
Payne.</TE>
<TE>   "The clergy and churches are not immune from this."</TE>
<TE>   The arrest comes as the Catholic church reels from accusations
that some of its priests molested children and were then allowed to
keep their clerical positions as the church kept their crimes secret.
But in the Truxton case, prosecutors praised leaders of the Fullerton
church for cooperating with investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "The church did everything [it] could," Payne said. "The church
investigated, they booted him out and they called the police. But at
the time, we couldn't do anything.... Now we have someone who came
forward."</TE>
<TE>   Truxton's public fall from grace began when a girl accused the
elder of sexual misconduct in 1992. She told church officials about
other victims, who launched their own investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials learned that similar allegations had been leveled
against Truxton when he was a member of the Mission Aviation
Fellowship based in Redlands, according to a search warrant affidavit
filed by police. Truxton was a member of Mission Aviation from 1945
through his retirement in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   First Evangelical Free Church leaders confronted Truxton about the
allegations. Truxton admitted in letters to church officials and
congregants that he was guilty of molestation. A member of the church
from 1958, Truxton was banished from the church grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways, it feels like it was yesterday because it was a
heartache," said church spokeswoman Jenni Key. "He was 76 and
elderly, he was much loved in the church, and it was just devastating
news."</TE>
<TE>   In the latest investigation, police discovered more than two dozen
women who accused Truxton of molestation. The alleged crimes took
place when the girls were between 7 and 13 years old, according to
court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the women accused Truxton of kissing and groping them,
documents show. Prosecutors said they were unable to file charges in
those cases, however, because the statute of limitations remains in
place unless the crimes are more serious, such as penetration or oral
copulation.</TE>
<TE>   During their investigation, Fullerton police collected evidence
from First Evangelical Free Church. Among the items police found were
letters that Truxton allegedly wrote to church officials, victims and
congregants.</TE>
<TE>   The letters, court documents said, included admissions of guilt
and expressions of regret for his actions.</TE>
<TE>   "As difficult and painful as it is for me to have to say it, I am
guilty of much more than ... excessive hugging and kissing," Truxton
wrote in a letter dated Oct. 28, 1992, according to the court
documents. "What I am guilty of is molestation."</TE>
<TE>   In another dated Sept. 24, 1992, he asked congregants to pray for
him as he left the church.</TE>
<TE>   "I plead for your prayers as I endeavor to make the remaining
years of my life free of such gross hypocrisy," he wrote, "but rather
that they will be full of fruitful and consistent living among God's
people."</TE>
<TE>   About 10:40 a.m. Wednesday, Fullerton police officers armed with
an arrest warrant went to Truxton's home in a retirement community in
Spring Valley, a small town east of San Diego. He was interrogated
and taken to Orange County Jail, where he was being held in lieu of
$25,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Truxton could not be reached Wednesday. His wife, reached at home,
declined to comment. But church officials said they stand behind
prosecutors' efforts to bring the case to trial, even while keeping
Truxton and his wife in their prayers.</TE>
<TE>   "We can pray for Jim and [his wife] as well," said Key, the church
spokeswoman, "but we're behind anything the district attorney's
office does to prosecute this case."</TE>

<LD>   The sweep is aimed at curbing an increase in smugglers' use of
LAX, officials say. The airport has long been known as a conduit for
illegal immigrants smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border and heading
to jobs and family members across the country.</LD>
<TE>   The operation, which began Monday in Terminal 1, netted 147
illegal immigrants in its first two days, officials said. All but two
were from Mexico. Most were headed to the East Coast. All are likely
to be quickly returned to their homelands. Some had paid as much as
$2,000 for the services of the smugglers, known as coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   Schiltgen called the action routine. The agency has periodically
run such operations at LAX, although this was the first such INS
action at the airport since Sept. 11. The terrorist attacks prompted
the federal government to boost security at airports nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The profitable people-smuggling business generally declined
following the attacks, authorities said, but it has appeared to be
rising again in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities concede that such sweeps generally do not stop
ongoing smuggling networks, but rather prompt the rings to seek other
routes for their clients.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to questions from the Spanish-language media at a
downtown news conference, Schiltgen denied that agents were targeting
people from Mexico or Latin America. Agents look for certain clues,
such as nervous demeanor or passengers who buy one-way tickets, he
said. "We don't base our arrests on the color of somebody's skin,"
Schiltgen said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those arrested were seized before they cleared security to
board planes, he said, but a few were taken into custody at departure
gates. The arrests came off without major incident, Schiltgen said,
adding that officials were careful not to cause any disruption at a
time when airports are under intensified security.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / SHRINE AUDITORIUM</KH>
<HD>You Know Where to Find Me, Oscar</HD>
<DH>Operators of the venue, which seats nearly twice as many as
the Kodak, are waiting for the academy's call.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Feeling like the scorned stepsister left behind on the night of the
ball, the Shrine Auditorium will be dark and lonely when Hollywood's
stars gather Sunday at the new Kodak Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   But like Cinderella, the Moorish-style landmark south of downtown
Los Angeles is planning a make-over.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the fraternal order that owns the 76-year-old
auditorium have scheduled a $3-million upgrade that they hope will
lure back Oscar and 6,300 of his friends.</LD>
<TE>   The Al Malaikah Shrine will shut down the huge hall over the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Workers will remove and reupholster its plush red theater seats
and refurbish the auditorium and its adjoining exhibition hall.</TE>
<TE>   Royal Street, outside the auditorium's five arched front doors,
will be closed off and converted into a landscaped plaza to form an
entryway.</TE>
<TE>   Shrine Auditorium operators say the changes will turn the hall
into everything the Kodak isn't: A venue that is as convenient to get
into as it is comfortable to sit in, and is big enough for a show
that is larger than life.</TE>
<TE>   "I predict the Academy Awards will be back here next year," said
Tom Reoch, an administrator of the Al Malaikah Shrine. "I'm 99%
certain they'll be back after what they will see this coming
weekend."</TE>
<TE>   Reoch's confidence is sharpened by complaints that have already
been lodged about the $94-million Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Music critics have drubbed the new auditorium's acoustics.
Motorists are grumbling about Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue
street closures prompted by Sunday's Academy Awards show. Merchants
are complaining about having their storefronts draped with camouflage
cloth on the town's biggest weekend of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Film stars are wondering how they will negotiate a difficult walk
into the theater in five-inch heels. Angriest of all are academy
members who will be unable to get in: The new theater will only
accommodate an audience of about 3,100 for the Oscar show.</TE>
<TE>   The Shrine, supporters note, is America's largest theater. Each of
its 6,300 seats has an unobstructed view of what is the country's
biggest performance stage.</TE>
<TE>   The auditorium was considered a triumph of architecture and civil
engineering when it opened in 1926 after two years of construction.
The concrete-walled structure cost $2.6 million and replaced a
smaller 14-year-old temple that burned in 1920.</TE>
<TE>   Its builders calculated that the Shrine's 192-foot-wide domed roof
weighs 1,870 tons. The theater's proscenium, the arch that frames the
stage curtain, is 100 feet wide.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors came to gawk at the auditorium's vast cantilevered
balcony. It seemed to float without pillars beneath a five-ton
crystal chandelier. The 28-foot-long fixture used 500 bulbs--and drew
62,445 watts when its red, white, blue and amber bulbs were lit.</TE>
<TE>   The hall was called the Los Angeles Civic Auditorium at first
because it was financed in part with stock sold to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the Ancient Arabic Order of Nobles of the Mystic Shrine
repurchased all of the shares and renamed it.</TE>
<TE>   For decades the auditorium was routinely booked for local events
and used as a movie backdrop. It is in the original "King Kong" film.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1930s it became so popular as a site for jitterbug
contests that police had to be called to control the crowds. During
World War II the huge hall was filled with military servicemen and
their dates for star-studded New Year's Eve shows.</TE>
<TE>   It was the setting for ballet, opera performances and religious
services in the 1950s. USC and UCLA played basketball games on the
192-foot-wide, 72-foot-deep stage. Democratic presidential hopeful
Adlai E. Stevenson drew a turn-away crowd of 6,700 when he gave a
1952 speech.</TE>
<TE>   But the Shrine is best known for the high-profile awards shows
held there. The Grammys, the American Music Awards, the Emmys and the
Soul Train Awards have been televised from its stage. The Academy
Awards--which first used the hall in 1947--alternated between there
and the smaller Dorothy Chandler Pavilion from 1988 to last year.</TE>
<TE>   Academy officials acknowledged that they relied on the Shrine's
seating capacity to handle a growing backlog of Oscar show ticket
requests they could not handle at the pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Over the decades the hall has survived countless earthquakes, two
riots and one airplane crash.</TE>
<TE>   A secret, unpiloted Navy plane smashed into the Shrine's roof near
its southwest cupola and burned in 1945. No one was injured--but no
one ever explained the mishap.</TE>
<TE>   A computerized stage system was among improvements made in 1993 as
part of a $15-million overhaul.</TE>
<TE>   Reoch said Shriners were disappointed when the Motion Picture
Academy signed with the Kodak Theatre for Sunday's show. So Al
Malaikah members will be closely observing how things go.</TE>
<TE>   "One part of us will be wishing the academy all the best. After
all, they represent Los Angeles and the United States to the world.
We don't want to see any foul-ups," Reoch said. "But we'll know if
things go wrong. We'll be watching.</TE>
<TE>   "This auditorium is always elegant. But when the Oscars come, it's
magnificent. They'll be back. I'm sure of that."</TE>

<HD>LAX Is Slow to Regain Travelers</HD>
<DH>Airports: Smaller regional fields are recovering faster
from the effects of Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles International Airport is slowly regaining passenger
traffic it lost after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But the
regional airports that ring Southern California's hub are regaining
passengers more rapidly, as fliers seek out convenience and at least
the perception of greater safety.</LD>
<LD>   Many fliers say that, in the wake of the attacks, they can move
more quickly and confidently through John Wayne, Ontario and Burbank
airports. Shorter lines at ticket counters and security checkpoints
are particularly attractive to those who have been caught in long
queues at LAX or other large hub airports.</LD>
<LD>   But there were some encouraging signs in figures released
Wednesday for Los Angeles' major international gateway. LAX is
enticing travelers back into the skies at a slightly faster pace than
some other big-city facilities, such as San Francisco International
Airport and John F. Kennedy and La Guardia airports in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Passenger traffic at LAX was down 16.5% in February from the same
month last year, according to figures from the city agency that
operates the airport. Passenger traffic at the airport was off 18.3%
in January and 19.8% in December from year-earlier levels.</TE>
<TE>   LAX's northern neighbor, San Francisco International, posted a
19.2% decline in traffic in January from the same month a year
earlier, and a 24.6% drop in December. At La Guardia and JFK,
passenger traffic was down around 20% in December and January.
February figures were not available for those facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Even with gradual gains in passengers, prompted in large part by
steeply discounted air fares, economists expect air travel to remain
depressed for the rest of the year. Air traffic should return to
pre-Sept. 11 levels in 2003, according to projections by the Federal
Aviation Administration.</TE>
<TE>   While larger airports struggle to return to passenger levels
charted before the attacks, smaller facilities are enjoying a
newfound popularity among vacationers and businesspeople.</TE>
<TE>   "Smaller airports are indicating to us that they do believe the
hassle factor is becoming a benefit for their facilities," said Scott
Foose, vice president of the Regional Airline Assn., a
Washington-based trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Kelly, a biomedical engineer from the Orange County
community of Placentia, would certainly concur. Kelly and fellow
travelers polled at John Wayne Airport this week said they prefer the
Orange County facility over LAX because of its uncrowded terminals,
shorter lines and the ability to park in the terminal complex.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been lots of scares and evacuations at LAX. It makes
you skittish," Kelly said. "If terrorists do something, the big
airports like LAX or [Chicago's] O'Hare are probably where they are
going to hit."</TE>
<TE>   John Wayne has recovered virtually all the travelers it lost after
Sept. 11. Passenger traffic in February was within 1% of the same
month a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Regional airport users such as Dallas resident Jerri Ann Massey
also say they are willing to pay more to use the smaller facilities.
The convenience of flying into Burbank Airport is worth the higher
ticket price, said Massey, a manager for Internet provider EarthLink
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Massey, who flies into Southern California about twice a month,
preferred LAX before the September terrorist attacks. But with the
heightened security and long lines there now, she prefers regional
airports, even if it means paying $100 more per ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "It actually saves more, because I spend more time getting work
done than standing in lines," said Massey, 46. "I can leave meetings
later in the day."</TE>
<TE>   Passenger traffic in Burbank was down about 6.7% in February from
a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, at Ontario International Airport, operated by the same
city agency that runs LAX, passenger traffic levels were down 7.1% in
February from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Industry watchers say the strength and economic resilience of
regional airlines, such as Southwest and upstart JetBlue, have been
the most critical factors in attracting customers back.</TE>
<TE>   "The airports doing relatively well have Southwest Airlines," said
Alex Zaslov, senior manger of economic affairs and research at the
Airport Operators Council International.</TE>
<TE>   "It has nothing to do with the size of the airport--it seems the
trend is based on having a low-cost carrier."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, at Long Beach Airport, where JetBlue started service to
JFK last summer, passenger traffic climbed 41% in both February and
January over year-earlier levels. The carrier expects to increase
flights at Long Beach from three to 27 a day in the next year.</TE>
<TE>   This trend has hurt airports like LAX, which suffered huge
cutbacks in its flight schedule after Sept. 11, most notably by its
largest carrier, United, which slashed its schedule by 40%.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons we're down to the extent we are is that United
cut back so much and they eliminated their Shuttle service," said
Paul Haney, an airport spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "Southwest stepped up to that by increasing its flight activity at
places like Burbank and Ontario."</TE>
<TE>   LAX was among the U.S. airports hardest hit by the steep downturn
in air travel after the hijackings. In the five months following the
attacks, LAX lost 22.5% of its commercial operations, according to
the FAA.</TE>
<TE>   La Guardia and JFK each posted a 21% loss in commercial operations
from September through January, while Reagan National Airport in
Washington, which had limited flights after the attacks, posted a 56%
downturn, FAA statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   But airlines are slowly adding back service at large hubs like
LAX. United and American announced that they will add flights at the
facility as summer approaches.</TE>
<TE>   The question remains if travelers will take advantage of these
additional flights.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Kristina Sauerwein and Dan Weikel contributed
to this report.</TE>

<HD>Fossil Skull Could Change Theory of Human Origins</HD>
<DH>Paleontology: Evidence of early ancestor's wide migrations reopens
the debate over evolution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A newly discovered fossil skull suggests that an early human
species migrated from Africa to Asia and back again before evolving into
modern humankind, an international team of researchers said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The fossil is the strongest evidence yet that the species called Homo
erectus--a tool-making, nomadic ancestor of humanity that was the first
creature to master fire--was a single species ranging across Africa,
Europe and Asia. Many scholars have argued in recent decades that Homo
erectus was actually two or more species.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery, unearthed in Ethiopia from the sediments of an ancient
lake shore, will be detailed today in Nature magazine.</LD>
<TE>   The new find is certain to revive scholarly arguments over a crucial
period of human evolution, experts said. It appears to simplify the human
family tree, but also to renew the debate over the role Asia may have
played in human origins.</TE>
<TE>   "What we now have is evidence that a single human ancestor species was
so successful that it was spread from Java to Italy to Ethiopia by 1
million years ago," said W. Henry Gilbert, a UC Berkeley graduate student
who discovered the skull during a 1997 field expedition.</TE>
<TE>   The find also highlights the crucial effect of climate change on human
evolution.</TE>
<TE>   The fossil skull belongs to a period when an abrupt climate change
plunged the world into an ice age. These early humans had first evolved
in Africa and then spread to Asia and Europe. As temperatures dropped
across the Northern Hemisphere, they may have moved south back into
Africa, as did many migrating herds in that era.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a time . . . when there was large-scale movement of many
species between continents everywhere on Earth due to major global
climatic change," said Yale University expert Elizabeth S. Vrba.</TE>
<TE>   "They came out of Asia into Africa. They would have had to move to
stay with water, to stay with food," she said. "There would have been
massive gene flow back and forth. That would get us the pattern we
see--one single, widespread species."</TE>
<TE>   The evidence for the new theories consists of the skull and leg bones
of six separate individuals that Gilbert and his colleagues found at a
site along an arid outwash in the Middle Awash region of Ethiopia. The
area is about 140 miles northeast of Addis Ababa.</TE>
<TE>   Ethiopian and American researchers have turned up fossils of many
prehuman and human ancestors there in recent years, including two
previously unknown hominid species.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert was working in the 110-degree heat as part of a team of 45
scientists from 13 countries led by Ethiopian anthropologist Berhane
Asfaw at the Rift Valley Research Service and UC Berkeley
paleoanthropologist Tim D. White.</TE>
<TE>   Scored by ancient fang marks and encrusted with fossilized roots, the
skull needed three years of painstaking work to clean and restore.</TE>
<TE>   "The new skull is gorgeous," said anthropologist C. Owen Lovejoy at
Kent State University, who has examined the find.</TE>
<TE>   "The new specimen greatly simplifies our view" of how Homo erectus
evolved, Lovejoy said. It paves the way "for new analyses of how and why
erectus eventually gave rise to Homo sapiens."</TE>
<TE>   University of Tokyo anthropologist Gen Suwa called the
1-million-year-old fossil skull "well-preserved, undistorted and
well-dated."</TE>
<TE>   'It is the best we have in Africa in that time frame," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The fossils of these restless creatures have been bones of contention
since the remains of the so-called "Java Man" were discovered in Asia
more than a century ago. Decades of research and dozens of fossil finds
in China, Europe and Africa have not settled how Homo erectus first
evolved or clarified its contribution to contemporary humanity.</TE>
<TE>   Although its bones first turned up in Asia, the oldest specimens of
Homo erectus have been discovered in Africa, home to all the earliest
known prehuman ancestors and universally considered the cradle of human
evolution.</TE>
<TE>   Homo erectus skulls vary widely. Those differences seemed so great
that some scientists theorized that these human ancestors divided into
two separate species between 1.5 million and 500,000 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, researchers had gathered the African fossils into a
separate species called Homo ergaster. The Asian fossils, they said, must
belong to an isolated branch of the human family that likely had little
or no direct contact with their African relatives after they split away.
That branch, therefore, would have no connection to modern Homo sapiens.</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary humanity, in that view, is an entirely African creation.</TE>
<TE>   This primeval skull contradicts that theory, the researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   If these early humans had diverged along separate evolutionary paths
as they spread across the Old World, the new Ethiopian specimen should
look quite different from its Asian relatives. Instead, the new skull is
similar enough to some found in Asia to show that even after almost a
million years of wandering, these creatures clearly all belonged to the
same species.</TE>
<TE>   That suggests there were substantial intermingling and interbreeding
as these early humans migrated back and forth across the continents, the
researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   "The skull has features of both 'Asian' and 'African' forms," said
Asfaw. "This clearly shows that features previously considered to
separate the Asian and African forms do not hold."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there is so little difference between those that lived in
Africa and those that lived in Asia that any conclusions about the
species' birthplace are "premature," the research team reported.</TE>
<TE>   The new findings raise the possibility that this ancestor of humankind
did not evolve solely in Africa as many scholars have believed, but with
a significant contribution from Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "It must have evolved [originally] from an African ancestor, but
whether this ancestral species dispersed from Africa before it gave rise
to Homo erectus--and whether this happened in Africa or Eurasia--are open
questions," said White at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers hypothesize that the rapid cooling of the climate may have
forced wandering bands of Homo erectus back into Africa and southern
Europe. After it resettled there, however, the species continued to
evolve. Eventually it split into several different species, again
adapting to the changing climate, the researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, the European branch of the erectus family became the
Neanderthals who roamed Europe and the Middle East, White suggested. The
Asian branch of the family eventually became extinct.</TE>
<TE>   The African clan evolved into anatomically modern humans, then once
more ventured out into the world.</TE>

<TE>Branches of the Family Tree</TE>
<TE>   Many anthropologists have believed that the fossil remains of Homo
ergaster and Homo erectus represent two different species of early
humans. But a discovery of fossils in Ethiopia that share characteristics
of both types indicates the fossils are all from a single Homo erectus
species that gave rise to modern humans and Neanderthals.</TE>

<HD>A New Lesson Plan in Afghan School</HD>
<DH>Education: Women and girls are in, calls to holy war are out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>At Mir Ahmad Shahid Primary School--to reach it, drive to the
damaged cinema, cross onto a dirt track, twist around a few curves and
then park by a fetid gutter--there was a rare sight Wednesday. Smiles.</LD>
<LD>   Beaming boys and girls lined up to mark the dedication of their
freshly painted, newly windowed school building, the fruit of
round-the-clock labor by Los Angeles-based Relief International.</LD>
<LD>   But mostly the children, parents and faculty were celebrating the new
school epoch that begins Saturday. For the first time since the Taliban
conquered this capital in 1996, there will be women teaching openly
again, classes that are no longer limited to boys and a fresh curriculum
shorn of calls to holy war and hatred of the West.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel I lost part of my life," said Shakila Shakbaz, a 16-year-old
girl who will be going back to school.</TE>
<TE>   She was in the fifth grade when the Taliban took over, and she studied
secretly at home enough to pass her sixth-grade test two weeks ago. But
she's still at least four years behind in her studies--a large deficit
for a young woman who hopes to become a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   The mood of making up for time lost under the Taliban pervades the
effort to get school started quickly and on the right foot this year.</TE>
<TE>   Brightly painted signs abound in this city of 2 million, exhorting
parents and students to take advantage of the renewed opportunity to
learn and put the dark years of ignorance behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's read" and "Let's study," the signs say.</TE>
<TE>   In some parts of the country, street theater troupes have even
presented little dramas to show the worth of education.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a herculean task to get all the preparations for school
done in the scant four months since the fall of the Taliban in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   But international organizations credit wholehearted support from the
administration of interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai and say they will
be ready with the needed supplies, textbooks, food and even temporary
tents for classrooms. The United States paid for the rush printing of 4
million de-Talibanized textbooks based on the books used before the
fundamentalist regime came to power.</TE>
<TE>   The White House took the opportunity Wednesday to publicize the full
gamut of U.S. assistance, public and private, to Afghanistan--and then
called for more.</TE>
<TE>   So far, American children have responded to the president's Oct. 11
call by sending $4.6 million to help buy supplies, clothing and medicine
for their peers in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "As a result of what our country and many of our friends have done,
girls get to go to school too--starting this week," President Bush said
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "And when they go to school, we want to make sure they've got
supplies. We want to make sure they've got tablets to write on and
Crayolas to color with, and even jump ropes to jump with," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aid officials here say a thirst for education is cresting nationwide,
so much so that the student population will be the largest in Afghan
history for the start of this school year, which usually begins in March
so the children don't have to endure frigid classrooms during the cold
winter months.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, has been the main mover
behind the nationwide campaign both to encourage pupils to come back to
the classroom and to obtain the supplies to make it possible.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Carwardine, a UNICEF spokesman in Kabul, said the effort was
the agency's most ambitious logistics challenge. "It involved packing
almost 25 kits with 50 different items every minute, day and night, for
more than three weeks," a UNICEF statement said. But by Saturday, 93% of
schools will be outfitted, Carwardine said.</TE>
<TE>   The need is dire, the agency points out: Only an estimated 32% of boys
and 8% of girls in Afghanistan have had any kind of elementary education.
Exact figures are hard to come by, Carwardine said, but of 4.4 million
school-age children, more than 1.7 million are expected to be registered
by the first day.</TE>
<TE>   Eric James, the country director here for Relief International,
(http://www.ri.org) said the reconstruction of the Mir Ahmad Shahid
building--one of 11 school building projects by his group--isn't a
cure-all.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed out that only 10 classrooms are available at the school,
which will draw an expected 1,000 students from this west Kabul
neighborhood. As a result, the children will have to attend in two
shifts. The same is true nationwide. There are simply not enough
classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The newly repaired school was a cheerful sight Wednesday, with
whitewashed walls, green trim, brand-new desks and squeaky-clean
blackboards. Against the backdrop of a ruined neighborhood that was
destroyed by shelling during the fight among warlords in Kabul in the
early 1990s, the school looks even more astonishing.</TE>
<TE>   The refurbishing of the building cost $34,000, and the carpentry for
new desks and benches for the students added $10,000 more. Funding came
in part from the German state aid agency BMZ, with the work done by
Relief International.</TE>
<TE>   "Very, very happy," teacher Latifa Matim said shyly in broken English,
describing her feelings during Wednesday's ribbon-cutting ceremony. She's
making her first venture back to the classroom in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Through a translator, she said that she had lost hope in the Taliban
years when she was banned from working, but now looks forward to helping
girls deprived of education. "Those who are illiterate will be able to
read," she said enthusiastically. And the promised monthly salary of 1.3
million afghanis, about $45, will make a big difference for her family,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said the improvements are wonderful. Gesturing toward the new
glass windows, she said, "Before we did not even have windows, not to
mention glass."</TE>
<TE>   Her principal, Mohammed Haq, explained that the shelling had knocked
out whole sections of the mud-brick walls, leaving gaping holes where the
window frames had been.</TE>
<TE>   "The main difference this year is that the school gates are open to
the girls," he said. "Everybody is happy about it--the old, the young,
men and women. Everyone felt sorry and angry before when we could not let
girls come to school or hold jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Haq said he is amazed at how many people from the neighborhood are
enrolling their children. The school will grow this year by 150%, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "During the past few years, when so many children were far from
learning, they have come to appreciate the value of education more," he
said. "Even those with financial problems are ready to send their
children to school."</TE>

<HD>Reclaiming Husbands in Kenya</HD>
<DH>Posses of women are taking aim at moonshine, which they say is
wrecking families. Officials agree with them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MURANGA DISTRICT, Kenya
</DL>
<LD>Bar owner Paul Minua knows this much: Hell hath no fury like women
scorned, neglected and abused by their drunken husbands.</LD>
<LD>   Minua, 35, was tending his bar in this scenic region of central Kenya
one recent Sunday when about 30 angry women carrying sticks and stones
stormed in. They demanded that he stop selling the high-proof alcohol
known to leave sons and husbands helpless, violent, even blind or dead.</LD>
<LD>   The ringleader was Mary Watiri, a 43-year-old grandmother Minua had
known since childhood. Despite his protests, Watiri and her comrades
jumped behind the counter, grabbed bottles of the cheaply made moonshine
and emptied them on the floor.</LD>
<TE>   Others broke open a storeroom, where they found more cases of the
liquor. Taking hundreds of the plastic bottles outside, the women emptied
them of their dark brown contents one by one--to the cheers of a small
crowd that had gathered.</TE>
<TE>   "We have come to bury changaa," the women sang out in their native
Kikuyu, using the local name for moonshine. "All we want is peace. Until
sales of these brews are stopped, the sellers will never sleep."</TE>
<TE>   "You could see the anger on their faces," Minua recalled. "I had to
run for my life. They would have killed me."</TE>
<TE>   Watiri and her neighbors in this coffee- and tea-growing region are
part of a grass-roots movement sweeping Kenya and other African
countries, from Uganda to Swaziland. Fed up with governments' refusal to
take action against distillers of dangerous alcoholic concoctions, women
from urban slums to rural villages are forming posses and shutting down
bars and so-called drinking dens.</TE>
<TE>   High-proof alcohol has proliferated in recent years as distillers, bar
owners and makers of traditional brews have targeted poor people looking
for a cheap high. One Kenyan company boasts that its assortment of
alcoholic drinks--including a product it calls Vatican Special Wine--was
created "with the hard-hit Kenyan in mind." Studies have shown that many
rural villagers and slum dwellers in African countries have resorted to
alcohol production in a desperate attempt to eke out a living.</TE>
<TE>   When husbands virtually abandon their homes for strong drink, wives
have to take over providing for their families.</TE>
<TE>   In Kenya, the behavior of the female activists sometimes borders on
mob justice. Even so, top lawmakers, the country's anti-drug czar and
even the Roman Catholic Church have given the movement their blessing,
calling it the only effective way to halt rampant alcoholism.</TE>
<TE>   "These women should be saluted," said Joseph Kaguthi, whom President
Daniel Arap Moi recently appointed to lead Kenya's anti-drug efforts. "I
am not going to have sleepless nights because these women are pouring
harmful liquor."</TE>
<TE>   Catholic Bishop Peter Kihara, who oversees 31 parishes in Muranga,
calls what the women are doing "the only way to stop the total
destruction of this community."</TE>
<TE>   "Changaa is turning men into zombies and wrecking families. The
community needs these women to save it," Kihara said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the women of the temperance movement in the U.S., the Kenyans
are not railing against consumption of all alcohol. They are targeting
mainly changaa--moonshine made largely from maize, sorghum or sugar cane.
Government chemists say it is often laced with methanol, battery acid,
embalming fluid and even industrial toilet cleaners.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these brewers add everything to boost their potency," said
Henry Mokaya, a senior chemist with the Kenya Bureau of Standards. "Many
of these brews have the kick of a mule, but they are poisonous."</TE>
<TE>   Kenyan media frequently feature reports of people who died after
drinking changaa. This month, seven people died after drinking a beverage
they looted from an overturned vehicle in Mt. Kenya. Among them was a
15-year-old high school student.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, about 150 people died and 500 others were hospitalized
after drinking hooch sold in two slums of the capital, Nairobi. The
beverage was known as kumi kumi, Swahili for "10-10," because a mug cost
only 10 Kenyan shillings--a little more than a dime.</TE>
<TE>   Many women woke up to find their husbands' corpses lying next to them,
while some of the drinkers woke up to permanent darkness. They had gone
blind because the kumi kumi contained methanol, which can destroy the
optic nerves.</TE>
<TE>   Watiri lives in the village of Wanjerere, on the slopes of the
Aberdare Range. The year-round temperature averages about 50
degrees--cool enough to nurture the pear orchard in her front yard and
perfect for growing tea, which Watiri and other villagers rely on for
their livelihoods.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, the Muranga district was among the most prosperous in
Kenya. Coffee from the region fetched among the highest prices at gourmet
coffee shops around the world. But in the mid-1990s, Muranga and its
400,000 people were hit by plummeting coffee prices and a Kenyan
government decision to halt subsidies to farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of men lost their jobs, and about 60% of Muranga's people now
live below the poverty line, meaning that their households earn less than
$1 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Muranga's men took to drink. Many reported to the bars
before 8 a.m. and returned home late at night.</TE>
<TE>   Watiri's husband, Peter, was a regular at the Aberdare Bar. He had
worked for several years protecting the lions, elephants and rhinoceroses
at Aberdare National Park from poachers--until he was fired for being
drunk on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Watiri became the family breadwinner. Most days, she woke at 4 a.m.,
milked the cow, trudged a mile to fetch water from the river, prepared
breakfast for her six children and sent them off to school before heading
out to take care of the family's 2,000 tea bushes.</TE>
<TE>   Peter, for his part, nursed his drinks at the Aberdare Bar, spending
the lion's share of the $900 the family earned annually from selling tea
leaves.</TE>
<TE>   The beverages Peter and his fellow topers consumed contained at least
50% alcohol, making many people here suspect that--as is routine in
Kenya--officials had received kitu kidogo, "a little something," to look
the other way.</TE>
<TE>   Peter and the other men drank changaa because of the price. A bottle
of Kenya's popular Tusker Lager beer costs the equivalent of 50 cents.
For the same price, they could buy half a liter of changaa, which
guaranteed them a buzz for the entire day.</TE>
<TE>   Nightly wife beatings, along with other kinds of domestic abuse,
became routine.</TE>
<TE>   Watiri said Peter began taking their 14-year-old son to the bar and
that, on many occasions, the two would return home, pick up machetes and
fight, while the couple's other children and grandchildren screamed in
horror. The next morning, father and son would deny that anything had
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Other women complained about sodden adult sons stripping naked in
front of them, about men who wet the bed and husbands and boyfriends
whose drinking rendered them impotent.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that makes them men are their trousers," said Emma
Wairimu, one of Watiri's neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "They cannot perform their matrimonial duties," she said, adding,
"It's rare to find a pregnant woman in this entire village."</TE>
<TE>   James Waweru, chairman of the local municipality, blames rampant
alcoholism for a dramatic drop in Muranga birthrates. This year,
enrollment at some primary schools fell by half, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If this kind of drinking continues, this community is facing total
collapse," Waweru said.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Watiri decided to do something. She asked other women to
meet her after church, and they formed the Wanjerere Anti-Corruption
Group, whose sole aim was to rid the village of potent libations.</TE>
<TE>   First, the women asked District Commissioner Obondo Kajumbi, the top
government official in Muranga, to help. He told them that there was
little he could do because most of the bars were licensed to sell liquor.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Watiri and her friends visited Minua, the owner of
the Aberdare Bar, and gave him an ultimatum: He had three days to get rid
of his strong drink, or else they would do it themselves.</TE>
<TE>   They kept their appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Watiri knew that she was running a risk. Among the patrons in the bar
when the women descended on it was her husband, who screamed at her to go
home. When she refused, he hit her several times, throwing her to the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   But Watiri considered the raid a success. The women had captured the
village's attention.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Watiri and her comrades walked 15 miles to another small
town, where they stormed into bars and disposed of several hundred
bottles of strong liquor. At one point, they spotted a truck that was
about to deliver a fresh supply. One woman threw a rock at the vehicle,
smashing its windshield.</TE>
<TE>   The rock-thrower spent the night in detention, but the next morning,
other women in the group sacrificed their families' grocery money and
raised $200--a significant sum here--to bail her out.</TE>
<TE>   At home, Watiri also reaped success. Shocked and embarrassed by what
she had done, Peter soon quit drinking.</TE>
<TE>   "He says he was lost, and he constantly asks me to forgive him,"
Watiri said. "If he was drinking, he'd be at the bar, but now he's
working in the [tea fields]. Everything is OK now."</TE>
<TE>   Word of the women's action spread. In one nearby village, women
borrowed their strategy, closing down several bars and parading an owner
through the town center, where they forced him to promise that he would
stop selling strong drink.</TE>
<TE>   Watiri and her comrades also made enemies. At the Grogan Bar in nearby
Kihoya, owner Kamau Mohindi talked about how he would defend his
premises.</TE>
<TE>   "They are women, but I would still fight with them," Mohindi said.
"This is how I make a living. We are not pumping the liquor down their
husbands' throats."</TE>
<TE>   It was only 10 a.m., but already the two dozen men in Mohindi's small
bar were drunk and begging a visitor to buy a round.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers said several bar owners had hired thugs to battle women who
invade their bars.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Watiri said, she is not worried. Her group received a boost
recently when local government officials instructed police not to
interfere with its campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to support the women," said Kajumbi, the district
commissioner, "because they are the conscience of the community."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Watiri said, she and her friends want to use their new sense of
empowerment to further improve their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the women told the landlord of the Aberdare Bar that if he
kicked out Minua, they would open a food cooperative on the premises,
enabling all the village's families to buy staples at lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   The women also have talked about pooling their money to bring a fuel
station to Wanjerere, so that people wouldn't have to travel 25 miles to
buy kerosene for their stoves and lamps.</TE>
<TE>   "These are all dreams, but we can't turn back now," Watiri said. "For
the first time in many years, we feel we have control of our lives."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Readies Plans for Terror Tribunals</HD>
<DH>Law: Proceedings would resemble courts-martial, with fewer appeals
and lenient evidence rules. Critics raise fairness issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration plans a military tribunal system for
captives taken in the Afghan war that is similar to U.S. court-martial
proceedings, but with far fewer appeals and a provision that could make
it easier to win death sentences, Pentagon officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, safeguards governing the rules of evidence will be
relaxed, and military prosecutors will have the advantage of introducing
documents and other material that normally would not be allowed in
civilian courts in this country, the officials said, speaking on the
condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld is scheduled to publicly
unveil the administration's long-awaited rules for the historic military
tribunals today.</LD>
<TE>   No tribunals have been scheduled for any of the prisoners of war now
being held in Central Asia or on the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba. But the Rumsfeld announcement will set the stage for what will take
place when the international community watches the United States mete out
justice for those who allegedly took up arms against America after the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The world now will begin to see what we meant by a fair system that
will enable us to bring people to justice [and] at the same time protect
[our] citizenry," President Bush said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if tribunals were imminent, Bush said: "No plans right now. . .
. There's nobody in mind as yet. But the option is available."</TE>
<TE>   Though the new system is less severe than originally envisioned, civil
rights groups and others quickly decried the proposal, saying it does not
reflect the fair administration of justice that the United States prides
itself on.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Edgar, an ACLU legislative attorney, said that despite the
White House assertions, "these tribunals appear starkly different from
regular courts-martial."</TE>
<TE>   He complained that because there would be only one level of appeal for
anyone who is convicted, it will be "putting the lives of defendants
solely in the hands of the president."</TE>
<TE>   And that system, he added, "will not respect basic American, and
international, ideals of fairness and justice."</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials said the tribunals will be called "commissions,"
and that the word "appeals" will not be included in the order outlining
the regulations. Rather, the order will use the word "review."</TE>
<TE>   They said the system will be similar to courts-martial in that there
will be a military setting and a military judge and jury. Each defendant
will be tried separately, and will be provided a military lawyer; he also
could privately retain a civilian attorney to bolster his defense.</TE>
<TE>   The juries will range from three to seven members, the sources said,
and verdicts must have the agreement of at least two-thirds of the
jurors, unlike criminal courts in the United States that traditionally
require a unanimous vote.</TE>
<TE>   But under the tribunal system, a death sentence must be unanimous.
However, if only three jurors end up hearing a case involving the death
penalty, the smaller pool would increase the chances for a death
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   The sources said defendants would be allowed to see the evidence
against them, but it could include some materials not normally allowed in
most courtrooms.</TE>
<TE>   An example is the material that has been found left behind in caves
and homes in Afghanistan during the war. Although prosecutors could use
it to incriminate defendants, most judges in U.S. courtrooms would
consider the evidence dubious at best, because it could be difficult to
link it directly to a specific defendant.</TE>
<TE>   If a conviction is reached, a defendant would be allowed just one
appeal, to a three-member review panel. That body, which would include a
military judge, would be the one and final arbiter.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike regular courts-martial, there would be no appeals to the
federal courts or the U.S. Supreme Court. Instead, the president would
act on any recommendation from the review panel.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a review of the findings by this review panel," said
one Pentagon official. "The word appeal does not appear in this order."</TE>
<TE>   The tribunals will be open to a limited number of media
representatives, but closed whenever classified material is discussed,
the sources said.</TE>
<TE>   "The understanding will be they will be open to the maximum extent
practicable," one official said. "But there's not going to be cameras or
broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   "However, we hope that there will be an arrangement for press to cover
them, either from a remote location with a satellite feed, or in the
courtroom itself. But none of these will be held in a giant arena that
can hold 50 million people."</TE>
<TE>   Sources stressed that no defendants have been singled out for
hearings. But they have suggested that even though 300 detainees are
being held in Cuba and hundreds more in Central Asia, there likely will
only be a small number of tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, it was estimated that tribunals could occur as soon as
this summer. But Wednesday, it appeared they would begin much later,
because U.S. military and intelligence officials are still sorting
through evidence and interviews with detainees.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I wouldn't expect a commission to be formed any time soon,"
the Pentagon official said. "No one here knows when. There's just no
decision yet on where they might be held, or for whom."</TE>
<TE>   Eugene R. Fidell, president of the National Institute of Military
Justice, said he hoped the Bush administration will announce the order as
recommendations only and allow a short time for the public to respond
before finalizing the rules and regulations.</TE>
<TE>   But William J. Haynes II, general counsel for the Department of
Defense, told the American Bar Assn. on Tuesday that the Pentagon decided
against allowing public input because of "the need to move decisively and
expeditiously in the ongoing war against terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty International USA said the lack of a lengthy appeal process
was "deeply troubling," especially because this will be a
precedent-setting endeavor and foreign nationals will be tried by a
government that is not their own.</TE>
<TE>   "Military commissions threaten to severely undermine, rather than
reinforce, confidence in the administration of justice and maintenance of
the rule of law," said the group's executive director, William F. Schulz.
"We fear that in the proceedings undertaken by military commissions,
justice may neither be done, nor seen to be done."</TE>
<TE>   However, Victoria Clarke, assistant secretary of Defense for public
affairs, defended the "new legal system to deal with very unconventional
circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is a very good package," she added. "When people see
the whole thing in its appropriate context, they will determine it to be
a very fair and balanced and just system."</TE>

<HD>Campaign Reform Bill Passes Congress; Bush Says He'll Sign</HD>
<DH>Politics: The landmark law is the first since Watergate to
seriously curtail the huge gifts of money being pumped into national
politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Senate approved a landmark change in federal campaign law on
Wednesday, sending President Bush a bill to check the rising flow of huge
donations into U.S. politics.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement released after the vote, Bush said he will sign the
bill, although he considers it "flawed in some areas."</LD>
<LD>   With Bush's signature, the bill would curtail a source of funding that
pumped roughly half a billion dollars into national politics in the last
presidential campaign. Party professionals already are retooling to
search aggressively for smaller donations to make up for that
loss--meaning American voters can expect more aggressive requests for
their money from politicians.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday's developments culminated a seven-year quest by reform
advocates in Congress to put some distance between politicians and
big-money donors. The bill's advocates say this is needed to boost public
confidence in government. Vanquished opponents said the measure will only
weaken political parties and trample on constitutionally protected free
speech.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's 60-40 vote for the bill followed its passage last month
in the House. The measure will produce the biggest shake-up in political
fund-raising since the post-Watergate reforms of the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Most significant, it would prohibit the national political parties
from raising or spending the unlimited, loosely regulated donations known
as soft money.</TE>
<TE>   These donations, a fund-raising innovation of the late 1980s that grew
strikingly in the 1990s, often amount to $100,000 or more. The givers are
corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals, many with business
before government. The money often helps the parties promote or attack
candidates in television ads.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is expected to force politicians to rely less on this narrow
band of donors and instead cultivate a broader base of contributions from
people able to give up to $2,000 at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "We all recognized one very simple truth--that campaign contributions
from a single source that run to the hundreds of thousands or millions of
dollars are not healthy for democracy," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.),
the bill's best-known sponsor. "Is that not self-evident? It is to the
American people."</TE>
<TE>   For the average American, the consequence of cracking down on big
donations will be that middle- to high-income voters should expect far
more mail or telephone calls seeking political donations. And parties
will encourage their wealthiest donors to ask peers to contribute.</TE>
<TE>   McCain, who first teamed with Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.) to
push for campaign finance reform in 1995, generated momentum for the
effort in his 2000 presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Now the bill's fate rests with the man who defeated McCain that year
in the GOP primaries.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in his statement, said: "The reforms passed today, while flawed
in some areas, still improve the current system overall, and I will sign
them into law."</TE>
<TE>   He did not specify his objections to the measure, but, echoing
criticism by its foes, he said: "It does present some legitimate
constitutional questions."</TE>
<TE>Expecting Some Provisions to Die</TE>
<TE>   One reason the president plans to sign the bill is that he anticipates
some of its provisions will be found unconstitutional, said a Republican
who has spoken to Bush about the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Bush praised parts of the measure, such as its increase in the maximum
amount of individual contributions to candidates. The limits on these
donations have not been raised since 1974.</TE>
<TE>   But the measure differs in several ways from the reform principles
Bush detailed as a candidate. Bush, for instance, favors banning soft
money donations by unions and corporations, but not by individuals.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also omits his proposal to require labor unions to obtain
permission from members before spending their dues on politics.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's Senate debate reprised arguments aired with more gusto and
tension last year when the Senate spent a rollicking two weeks on the
issue. Back then, opponents fought with everything they had. This time,
they readily conceded that they lacked the votes to amend the bill or
sustain a filibuster to block it.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the opponents concentrated on sharpening their arguments for
the legal challenges expected to begin as soon as the bill becomes law.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who intends to become the lead plaintiff
in the case, cited in his criticism "the ultimate campaign reform--the
1st Amendment to the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   He said the bill would muzzle political parties, shifting power from
them to special interests. For instance, he said the bill would still
allow unions, corporations and interest groups--such as the Sierra Club
or the National Rifle Assn.--to spend soft money at will during much of
the year on political ads.</TE>
<TE>   He also charged that some of these ads would be sponsored by "front
groups" that would be hard to trace back to their original source.</TE>
<TE>   The bill takes some steps to limit the political activities of unions,
corporations and interest groups. For instance, they would be prohibited
from using their money to pay for television or radio advertising that
targets a federal candidate one month before a primary election and two
months before a general election.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell also said that much of the push for the bill came not from
the public but from major newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   "Today is not a moment of great courage for the legislative branch,"
McConnell said. "We have allowed a few powerful editorial pages to prod
us into infringing the 1st Amendment rights of everyone but them."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), another fervent opponent, waved a pocket
copy of the Constitution as he declared: "This bill is a movement back to
the smoke-filled room. This concentrates power in fewer and fewer and
fewer hands. This is profoundly anti-democratic."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents countered that Congress was rescuing public officials from
a never-ending stream of questions about how big donors seek access and
favors in Washington. Their latest example: the now-bankrupt Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The energy company and its executives gave $3.5 million in soft money
over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Republicans and Democrats collected $495 million in soft money
during the 1999-2000 election cycle--more than five times the $86 million
collected in 1991-92.</TE>
<TE>   And in 2001, soft money accounted for nearly half the donations
collected by the two parties.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't look good," said Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.), a
proponent. "The average Joe on the street believes that with that much
money being paid by that few people, that they're expecting something for
it."</TE>
<TE>   The backers acknowledged that the bill represented just a fraction of
what many reformers have long demanded. It proposes no new limits on what
political campaigns can spend, no limits on what television stations can
charge for political advertising and no public financing of campaigns.
And the bill takes several steps to ease the limits on donations.</TE>
<TE>   "No one should have any illusion that if we pass this legislation we
get the big money out of politics," said Sen. Paul D. Wellstone
(D-Minn.), a backer of the bill. "This legislation is the first step, not
the last."</TE>
<TE>   A basic compromise lies at the heart of the bill: While taking soft
money donations away from the national parties, effective after this
year's congressional elections, it would raise the limits on the
contributions known as hard money.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1974, hard money contributions from individual donors have been
limited to $1,000 per candidate per election and a total of $50,000 over
two years.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would raise those limits to $2,000 and $95,000, respectively,
and allow those amounts to increase over time with inflation.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, while soft money to national parties would be banned, a
politically active married couple could still give $190,000 in an
election cycle to parties and candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts say provisions of the bill that affect soft and hard
money appear likely to withstand legal challenges because the Supreme
Court has repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of campaign
contribution limits. Also, direct contributions to federal candidates by
corporations and unions have long been illegal.</TE>
<TE>   More vulnerable are the provisions imposing the regulations on
political advertising by corporations, labor unions and interest groups.
The bill's proponents say these "issue ads" amount to another soft money
loophole that should be regulated.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the affected groups say they are simply exercising free
speech protected under the Constitution. The issue-ad restrictions in the
bill have been roundly criticized by groups spanning the ideological
spectrum, from the American Civil Liberties Union to the American
Conservative Union. A letter conservative activists sent to Bush on
Wednesday urged the president to "do everyone a favor by vetoing" the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   Others hailed the congressional action. "Americans have won an
historic victory to help bring our government back to the people," said
Scott Harshbarger, president of Common Cause, a group that has long
backed the campaign finance legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The House approved the bill, 240 to 189, on Feb. 14. It passed with
support from a solid bloc of Democrats and a maverick group of
Republicans. In Wednesday's Senate vote, 11 Republican senators joined 48
Democrats and one independent to approve the bill. Only two Democrats
opposed the bill: Sens. John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Ben Nelson of
Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday, in a critical vote to force final action, the
bill's proponents logged an even bigger victory margin. By 68 to 32, the
Senate swatted down any lingering threat of a filibuster.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Ronald Brownstein contributed to this story.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>What the Bill Does</TE>
<TE> The main elements of the campaign finance bill passed by Congress on
Wednesday:</TE>
<TE>Soft Money</TE>
<TE>   The bill prohibits national political parties from raising or spending
soft money, which refers to unlimited political contributions from
unions, corporations or individuals. It also bans state and local parties
from spending soft money on federal elections, with one exception:
allowing parties to collect up to $10,000 per donor annually in states
that allow soft money. That money could be used only for voter
registration and turnout efforts.</TE>
<TE>Hard Money</TE>
<TE>   The measure doubles to $2,000 per election what individuals can give
to candidates for president and Congress. It also increases how much an
individual can donate to parties and candidates from $50,000 to $95,000
every two years. These limits would be indexed for inflation. The bill
also would ease contribution limits even further under certain
circumstances for federal candidates who face wealthy, self-financed
opponents.</TE>
<TE>Advertisements</TE>
<TE>   The bill bars special-interest groups from using their general funds
to pay for television or radio advertising that targets a federal
candidate one month before a primary election and two months before a
general election.</TE>
<TE>Court Review</TE>
<TE>   The bill would allow some of its provisions to remain in effect even
if others are struck down by the courts.</TE>
<TE>Effective Date</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 6, 2002, for most of the bill. The hard-money limits would take
effect Jan. 1, 2003.</TE>

<HD>4 Bodies Believed Tied to Kidnaps</HD>
<DH>Crime: Victims found in reservoir may be from Southland. Four
suspects are in federal custody.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Four bodies pulled from the murky depths of a Central California
reservoir are believed to be the victims of a brutal kidnapping ring
whose alleged members were indicted this month by a federal grand jury in
Los Angeles, law enforcement officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Although officials have not publicly identified the bodies, sources
close to the FBI investigation said they believe the victims include a
Beverly Hills businessman, his associate, his bookkeeper and a North
Hollywood businessman. In the case of the Beverly Hills man, the
kidnappers allegedly sought $5 million in ransom.</LD>
<LD>   Although much about the case is unclear, it appears that the victims
were kidnapped and killed, their weighted bodies tossed off bridges into
the New Melones Reservoir along California 49 in the heart of the Mother
Lode.</LD>
<TE>   Like the four suspects now in federal custody, all four victims
apparently had roots in the former Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   It was not known whether the four killings are linked to a body found
floating in the same waters last October. Those remains were identified
Tuesday as real estate developer Meyer Muscatel of Sherman Oaks, the only
victim whose identity has been verified. Muscatel's daughter said the
family has not yet been told details of the investigation into her
father's death.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'This is a lot for you to hear right now,' " said Rachel
Muscatel, recalling her meeting with Los Angeles Police Department
detectives.</TE>
<TE>   The March 5 indictment identified two men, Georgy Safiev of Beverly
Hills and Alexander Umansky of North Hollywood, as kidnap victims of a
group of four Russian-speaking men.</TE>
<TE>Indictment Names Four Suspects</TE>
<TE>   The indictment alleges that Iouri Mikhel and Jurijus Kadamovas "seized
and detained" Umansky sometime around Dec. 13, demanded a $234,628 ransom
from his family and threatened to injure or kill him if it wasn't paid.
The indictment also alleges that Petro Krylov and Ainar Altmanis "aided
and abetted" the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Umansky is president of Advanced Mobile Technologies, also listed as
Hard Wired Auto Accessories, in North Hollywood. The small business
started in 1998 and sells electronics and security systems.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 20, the indictment alleges, Mikhel and Kadamovas kidnapped
Safiev and similarly threatened his life unless a ransom of $5 million
was paid.</TE>
<TE>   Records and interviews identify businessman Safiev as president of
Matador Communications, a Santa Monica film production company. Nick
Kharabadze, according to records, is the company's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for three of the four suspects either could not be reached
or declined to comment on the case. Krylov's lawyer, George Buehler, said
he had no idea authorities might be investigating links between his
client and the bodies found at New Melones, and that the kidnapping case
against his client is "very thin."</TE>
<TE>   "The government has been extremely tight with information," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Krylov's wife, Natalie, said Wednesday that her husband is innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a gangster," she said. "I don't know how he [could be]
related to this nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   In a related case, two men were arrested Feb. 11 and charged with
helping to transfer $240,000 in ransom paid to the kidnappers for the
release of Umansky. One of them, Andrei Agueev, a Dubai businessman, was
"kidnapped" by the American government from his homeland last month, said
his defense attorney, Victor Sherman.</TE>
<TE>   Agueev has pleaded not guilty and his trial has been set for April 9.
The other man, Andrei Liapine, also has pleaded not guilty. His attorney
said he is a Russian citizen who lives in the United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment against the four main suspects does not mention the
other two people who authorities believe were kidnapped. Law enforcement
officials identified them as Kharabadze, and Safiev's bookkeeper,
39-year-old Rita Pekler of West Hollywood. Pekler vanished on Dec. 5,
Kharabadze sometime later.</TE>
<TE>   However, one law enforcement source said the disappearance of the two
has been linked to the four suspects. That official and another law
enforcement source said the kidnapping investigation led to the search
and discovery of the four bodies pulled this week from New Melones, a
deep, narrow reservoir east of Modesto that is popular for boating and
fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Those bodies, authorities have said, include three men and a woman.</TE>
<TE>   The bottle-green reservoir, created as part of a federal flood-control
project in the 1960s and '70s, looks more like a river as it snakes
through the oak- and pine-dotted hills of Calaveras and Tuolumne
counties. It was there that authorities found Muscatel's body floating
last October, a week after his disappearance. And it was there that
divers found two bodies Sunday, another Monday and one--the woman's--on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators returned to one of the bridges to search further on
Wednesday. For hours, FBI agents and sheriff's deputies from the two
adjoining counties bobbed on an aluminum pontoon boat above a
remote-controlled submersible, but the operation was suspended in
midafternoon, with authorities saying they believed there were no more
bodies in the reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. John Steely, chief deputy coroner of Tuolumne County, said he
couldn't say how long the bodies had been in the water. He also said that
autopsies were being conducted on the two bodies pulled out Sunday, but
he could not say what had been learned.</TE>
<TE>   FBI spokesman Nick Rossi said the search for the bodies began on March
4 at another nearby body of water, Don Pedro Reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   Although the full outline of the case remained hazy, the few details
that have trickled out so far suggest a ruthless group of kidnappers who
terrorized victims into seeking out large sums of money in a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   According to one knowledgeable source, whose information mirrors some
official accounts, after Safiev disappeared, a colleague received a
telephone call from him in which he reportedly said, "I need money
wired--no questions asked."</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, the FBI learned that more than $1 million was wired from
Moscow to the United States in connection with the case.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, Safiev was seized on Jan. 20 in Los
Angeles County. Two kidnappers allegedly attempted to extort $5 million
in ransom from Kostantinos Tezhik, believed to be another associate of
Safiev.</TE>
<TE>   A business associate of Pekler, Nellie Faktorovich, said she left
their West Hollywood office for a business meeting on Dec. 5 and never
returned. "Honestly, I don't see any reason why," Faktorovich said. "She
was loved and respected in the Russian community."</TE>
<TE>   Pekler's name and business mailing address, records show, were listed
for a real estate company whose registered agent is Safiev. Her
accounting firm reported an estimated $600,000 in business last year.</TE>
<TE>   Kharabadze, 29, lived in Woodland Hills, but was originally from
Tbilisi, Georgia. He was an aspiring film producer and son of Rusiko
Kiknadze, a famous Georgian film and stage actress, according to
stepfather Mat Shatz.</TE>
<TE>   Kharabadze and Safiev, 38, had spent the last year as business
partners, Shatz said.</TE>
<TE>   Pekler balanced the company's books. She was the first to disappear.
In a final, befuddling phone call to Safiev, she asked to see him right
away, Shatz said. Safiev told her he was boarding a plane; it was the
last anyone heard from her, Shatz said. On Wednesday, Shatz said, the FBI
told the family they assumed two of the bodies were those of their son
and Safiev, but they still had to check dental records.</TE>
<TE>   At Kharabadze's Woodland Hills home, a group of depressed and angry
friends gathered in the backyard Wednesday, speaking Russian and English
around a table covered with cigarettes, ashtrays, and a fat stack of
photos of the aspiring filmmaker. Kharabadze's mother appeared briefly,
but broke down and ran up the stairs before saying anything.</TE>
<TE>   Shatz painted a vivid picture of his stepson, a USC graduate who hoped
to carry on his mother's artistic legacy by producing feature films. "I
don't even care who should be jailed," he said. "I want my boy back. He
was an angel. This guy never had any problem with anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Although no links have been drawn between the four alleged kidnap
victims and Muscatel, some aspects of his disappearance are similar. He
was last seen on Oct. 11, when he told his daughter that he had a
business meeting with a potential investor in a Malibu housing
development. He subsequently tried to withdraw money from his bank,
saying he was in danger.</TE>
<TE>Family Frustrated by Father's Case</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Muscatel described her father as a successful real estate
developer who combined street smarts with deep spiritual values. A devout
Jew, he launched his company, Best Avnet, about 12 years ago, buying and
rehabilitating modest, single-family homes in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "He took pleasure in providing homes for people," his daughter said.</TE>
<TE>   When he wasn't working, she added, Muscatel spent time playing chess
or dreaming of setting up learning centers for disadvantaged children.
"He wanted to get out of real estate and devote his time to community
outreach work," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Muscatel said family members were frustrated by what they
considered to be a lack of attention to her father's case.</TE>
<TE>   "They said a lot of 58-year-old men pack up and leave their lives,"
she said. "They made it sound like he was on the beach somewhere drinking
margaritas. We knew something was wrong; we just didn't know what."</TE>
<TE>   For five months, relatives pressed law enforcement to find Muscatel.
They hoped that he would call or walk through the door of his home. There
were no clues of nefarious business practices, his daughter added. "I
wish there were," she said. "Maybe we could have found him sooner."</TE>

<HD>Priests' Victims Feel Vindicated</HD>
<DH>Molestation: For years they were dismissed and disdained. But now
the world and the church are listening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of being disdained, dismissed or simply ignored,
longtime crusaders against sexual abuse by priests suddenly have entered
a kind of promised land. It's an unfamiliar place where Catholic bishops
apologize, prosecutors and politicians listen, and a friendly media army
helps fight their battles.</LD>
<LD>   And, perhaps most soothing to the victims' scarred souls, people
finally believe them.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd never thought I'd see this day," said David Clohessy, national
director of the St. Louis-based Survivors Network of Those Abused by
Priests, known as SNAP, one of the nation's two largest such groups, with
3,500 members. "We've been crying from the rooftops for someone to notice
what's going on for so long."</LD>
<TE>   Clohessy is among the 10 or so original activists who found each other
a decade ago and became bound by phone calls, e-mails and anger.</TE>
<TE>   They quickly got used to losing: Catholic dioceses avoided many
potential court fights and messy publicity by writing settlement checks
on the condition that the victims remained silent. Some priests
implicated in abuse cases were quietly transferred to other churches.
Other victims were told their complaint was an isolated incident and that
the priest was now rehabilitated.</TE>
<TE>   Those defensive tactics began cracking two months ago with newspaper
revelations in Boston that a priest had molested more than 130 boys while
being moved by superiors from parish to parish.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, a flurry of other news reports, claims by victims and
dismissals by dioceses in 11 states have alleged child sexual misconduct
by nearly 100 priests.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, a number of priests have been ordered to
retire or resign, church sources say.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Boston case broke, the victims have watched the dominoes
fall in ways they scarcely imagined: Dioceses are combing through
personnel files to rid their ranks of any priest with a molestation in
his background. Politicians are introducing legislation to eliminate the
statue of limitations for sexual abuse of minors. Priests are attending
mandatory classes on sexual abuse of minors.</TE>
<TE>   Says Peter Isely, a 41-year-old victim of priest abuse from Milwaukee
who entered the battle 10 years ago: "The dioceses spent tens of millions
of dollars on the highest-priced lawyers from across the country and
hired the best public relations firm to fight us. And what did we have?
All we had was the truth."</TE>
<TE>   When Isely talks about the frustration of not having his allegations
taken seriously, he remembers a day in 1991 when he visited the Catholic
school in Wisconsin, where he said he was abused for three years in the
1970s, starting at age 13. It was winter break. Fresh snow had fallen,
leaving a blank white slope on a hill on the campus. Isely said he began
writing a large, profane message to the friars in the snow with his hands
and feet.</TE>
<TE>   Today, he and other advocates, long convinced that no one believed
them, are sought after by the media and other victims who have finally
decided to come forward.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Anderson, a St. Paul, Minn., attorney who pioneered sexual abuse
litigation against the Catholic Church in the mid-1980s, estimates he has
gone from half a dozen messages a week from possible victims to more than
a dozen a day.</TE>
<TE>   A SNAP volunteer finds herself in trouble with her boss at work
because of the number of incoming calls from victims. And another
victims' rights advocate simply can't answer all the incoming calls each
day.</TE>
<TE>   "To the church," said one California victim who recently filed suit
against a priest, "I guess it appears like a scene straight from 'The
Night of the Living Dead.' Injured zombies slowly inching their way
toward the door."</TE>
<TE>   The activists have had significant help from a handful of people they
refer to as "their angels." Father Thomas Doyle, a church-law attorney,
co-wrote a controversial report in 1985 that predicted the current sex
scandal. He has testified for victims in scores of cases and apologized
when the church would not.</TE>
<TE>   Former Catholic priest Richard Sipe researched and wrote books such as
"Sex, Priests and Power: Anatomy of a Crisis" that gave weight to the
victims' arguments, as did journalist Jason Berry's book "Lead Us Not
Into Temptation: Catholic Priests and the Sexual Abuse of Children."</TE>
<TE>   The National Catholic Reporter, an independent weekly, began
aggressively reporting on the scandal in 1985. And attorneys such as
Anderson sued the church years before representing victims became a
lucrative business--and in the process become targets of community
hatred.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson has a bulletin board in his office that displays the most
vicious letters. For example: "It's a good thing you were a draft-dodging
weasel, for it was unanimous at my Legion Club that a piece of garbage
like you would have been fragged in about five minutes. You are the scum
maggot of this country!"</TE>
<TE>   The victims, for the most part though, have had to go it alone--and
suffer ridicule and scorn from everyone from their parish priest to their
mothers and fathers.</TE>
<TE>   Isely said he has experienced repeated harassment by Catholic Church
representatives, ranging from court summonses delivered to his wife late
at night while he was out of town to threatened libel and slander
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, an attorney for the church told the media he would seek a gag
order to keep Isely from commenting about a priest-abuse case. "We want
him to zip up until the case is over," the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Isely, a psychotherapist with a master's degree from Harvard Divinity
School, said it was typical of the church's tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "Their strategy from Day 1 is to scare and to terrify," he said. "All
they have to do is make these veiled threats. Victims are a scared group
of people. Their policy had been very effective--until people started to
go public."</TE>
<TE>   Church authorities take issue with the idea that the majority of
victims have been mistreated after coming forward, especially over the
last 10 years as church policy has evolved.</TE>
<TE>   These leaders have acknowledged past mistakes in dealing with priests
involved in the sexual abuse of minors, saying the church had
misunderstood the causes.</TE>
<TE>   "[First] we saw it as a moral failing, to be addressed by penance,"
wrote Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, president of the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops, in a widely disseminated statement released last month.</TE>
<TE>   "Later, we viewed these tendencies as mental illness, which doctors
suggested could be controlled, if not cured. Most of today's specialists
believe otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   The church's official position now more closely mirrors what victim
rights' advocates have been lobbying for.</TE>
<TE>   "The law rightly makes it clear that sexual abuse of minors is a
crime," Gregory said. "We have all been enlightened. We continue to learn
from our experiences and, hopefully, even more from our mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Terrie Light, a resident of the Bay Area who went public with her
allegations of priest abuse in 1993, remembers the venom of loyal laity.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was leading a protest outside a Hayward, Calif., parish a
few weeks after the high-profile funeral for a priest who allegedly had
molested Light as a girl. "A woman came up to my son and yelled, 'Your
mother never got abused by Father Francis!' " said Light, a 50-year-old
mother of six who works with the homeless in Oakland. " 'She's a liar!'
Then they called the police on us."</TE>
<TE>   And then there are reactions from some parents who cannot believe that
their favorite priest was capable of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   When one victim told her mother of the molestation, "She said, 'Oh,
but he was such a good administrator!' " the victim recalled. "She was
not angry for me, though. My mom never has gotten past this. She's a
Catholic first; that's what it appears, at least."</TE>
<TE>   The low point in the victims' movement happened in 1994, when Steven
Cook, then 34, recanted his story that he had been sexually abused by
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago. Cook withdrew the charges, saying
he couldn't trust the repressed memories that had surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   Archbishop William H. Keeler of Baltimore said at the time, "Without
impugning the seriousness of authentic cases of sexual abuse, important
questions remain concerning the role of certain attorneys, psychiatrists
and media in bringing reckless charges against innocent people."</TE>
<TE>   Said Mary Grant, who founded the SNAP chapter in Southern California:
"People started to question the victims. [Cook] recanted, but that didn't
change what was happening in the church."</TE>
<TE>   Isely said that Bernardin was impressed enough with the victim
advocate movement that he requested a meeting with him and SNAP founder
Barbara Blaine.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to see what else we all could do" to prevent further
molestations, Isely said. "No important person in the church has done
that for us."</TE>
<TE>   But Bernardin died in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   So the handful of advocates kept at it, graphically retelling their
stories of sexual abuse. "It [stinks] talking about it," Isely said. "But
when you give details, it's harder for them to run away from it."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Clohessy of St. Louis: "It's wonderful that people who have been
bottling up this stuff for years are getting it out. But then I think,
there's so much pain that could have been avoided."</TE>
<TE>   For perspective, some activists offer a venerated priest's warning
about the clergy's sexual abuse of minors: "Unless the [Catholic Church]
intervenes as soon as possible, there is no doubt but that this unbridled
wickedness, even though it should wish to be restrained, will be unable
to stop on its headlong course."</TE>
<TE>   Those are the words of St. Peter Damian, a Benedictine monk writing in
the 11th century.</TE>
<TE>   The 21st century reformers lament the fact that they had no priests
like St. Peter Damian to protect children from sexual assaults by fellow
clergy members.</TE>
<TE>   "Where are the good priests?" Isely asks. "When they turn in one of
their own, they'll start to make me a believer."</TE>

<HD>Mexican Expatriates Want Ability to Vote, Seek Office</HD>
<DH>Politics: Citing their remittances to nation, a delegation of
migrants lobbies for reforms. 'It is time for us to reclaim our rights,'
one activist says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>Decades after they left for the United States, 60 expatriates
returned home this week to lobby for the ability to vote and run in
Mexican elections.</LD>
<LD>   The delegation of migrants came from California, Illinois, Washington
state and New York to reignite interest in an issue that has sputtered
for years. Its main goal: persuading the government to register between
10 million and 20 million Mexicans expatriates and create polling places
for them in the United States and other countries.</LD>
<LD>   "We have been denied rights that are clearly in the constitution,"
said Antonio Moreno, vice president of the immigrant group Michoacan
Federation of California.</LD>
<TE>   "We are contributing to the economy in Mexico, but we have no rights,"
said Moreno, who left Mexico 30 years and now lives in Huntington Park.
"Now we want to vote, we want our own representatives, and we want them
to come from our own ranks."</TE>
<TE>   Mexicans abroad send $8.5 billion a year home to family members and
pump money into national tourism and real estate, according to the
delegation here this week on a lobbying mission dubbed Migrantour.</TE>
<TE>   All of Mexico's major political parties acknowledge expatriates' right
to vote here. But an effort to clarify the laws on the matter died in
Mexico's Senate in 1998. More pragmatically, no party has had the
political stamina to create an international voting system expansive
enough to process the votes.</TE>
<TE>   Many countries allow absentee voting by citizens abroad. But no other
country has so many millions of expatriates who want to vote in absentia
in national elections.</TE>
<TE>   A 1998 report concluded that Mexico's electoral institute could handle
the counting of expatriates' votes. But setting up an international
polling system could take months, if not years. That delay would spoil
Migrantour's bid to secure the vote in 2003 legislative elections, said
Ramon Leon Morales, a legislator from the center-left Democratic
Revolutionary Party, or PRD, who backs the Migrantour efforts.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Leon explained the plight of the migrants to the Chamber
of Deputies, Mexico's lower house of Congress. A dozen members of the
expatriate delegation sat in the audience, chanting, "Si se puede!" or
"Yes, it can be done!"</TE>
<TE>   Some opposition figures believe that efforts to extend the vote to
expatriates were quashed by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI, which dominated Mexico for seven decades.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Vicente Fox of the opposition National Action Party, or PAN,
took over the presidency after a campaign that embraced migrants and
promised them the vote. But no legislative action has yet been taken.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Mujica, a Chicago-based activist who organized Migrantour, said
the timing is right for the voting campaign. "Mexico's perception of
[migrants] has changed. We were seen as people who picked fruit in fields
and hid from la migra [immigration authorities]. Now every family in
Mexico has someone in the United States," he said. "It is time for us to
reclaim our rights."</TE>
<TE>   Fox's election, a dual nationality program approved in 1998, and the
formation of a migrants lobbying coalition in mid-2001 in the United
States set the stage for the trip to Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   But even before arriving, the group split into two. One faction
proposed that migrants be named to legislative slates selected on party
lines. The other faction, represented by the Migrantour group, proposes
direct representation: Members want the Mexican legislature to add 10
senators and 40 lower-house legislators, likely chosen from the ranks of
migrants, to represent Mexicans abroad. There are currently 128 senators
and 500 legislators.</TE>
<TE>   At least three U.S. residents, including one American citizen, have
already tried to run for office in Mexico. Yolo County resident Andres
Bermudez ran last July for mayor of the city of Jerez in Zacatecas state,
about 400 miles northwest of Mexico City, but his victory was overturned
because he had not lived in the city for one year before the election.</TE>
<TE>   Many legislators here doubt that voting rights could be ensured
quickly, perhaps not until presidential elections in 2006. They continue
to debate whether migrants should be able to vote in congressional
elections or presidential elections or both. And they are calculating how
Mexico could pay for conducting elections abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Irma Pineyro, a PRI legislator who heads the lower house committee on
population, borders and migration, said her party does not consider
expatriates' voting rights a priority.</TE>
<TE>   "I see more pressing issues, including the number of undocumented
immigrants [in the U.S.], their labor rights and their medical coverage,"
Pineyro said.</TE>
<TE>   But the migrants hold out hope for immediate action.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not asking for anything. We are demanding it," said Felipe
Aguirre, an official for the California-based affiliate of the PRD, who
lives in Maywood. "We send money here, and we receive nothing in return."</TE>

<HD>Gun Ties Guerrilla Group to Advisor's Slaying in Italy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>Italy's top security official said Wednesday that an offshoot of
the Red Brigades guerrilla group killed Marco Biagi, co-author of a
bitterly contested government bill that would make it easier to fire
workers.</LD>
<LD>   Interior Minister Claudio Scajola said that initial tests by police
indicated that Biagi was shot Tuesday night with the same 9-millimeter
handgun used in the 1999 slaying of another government advisor who was
involved in a previous effort to liberalize the rigid labor code.</LD>
<LD>   The Red Brigades for the Building of the Fighting Communist Party
claimed responsibility for the 1999 killing in Rome of Massimo D'Antona.
A caller saying he represents the same faction told an Italian newspaper
on Wednesday that it was behind Tuesday's hit in Bologna.</LD>
<TE>   Scajola, who hurried home Wednesday from a shortened visit to the
United States, told reporters that the weapons link "confirms we are
dealing with the Red Brigades Fighting Communists."</TE>
<TE>   Biagi was a little-known economist, law professor and Labor Ministry
advisor, but his slaying jolted the nation. Italians are passionately
divided over the center-right government's legislation and the
leftist-led trade union movement's bid to block it by calling a general
strike next month.</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with the 1999 slaying, Tuesday night's violence was taken as a
warning that domestic terrorism, a scourge that Italians thought they had
defeated more than a decade ago, might prove to be a potent threat to
economic reform.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's previous, center-left government also tried to liberalize the
labor code but failed. Both slain advisors had served in that effort, and
Biagi had been assigned government bodyguards for 13 months, until they
were removed last October.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Biagi, 51, was arriving home on a bicycle when at least
three shots were fired from a motorcycle carrying two men. He was hit in
the throat and in the chest and was pronounced dead on arrival at a
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   It was only the second political killing attributed to a Red Brigades
faction since 1988. The Red Brigades, along with rightist groups,
bloodied Italy with terrorist attacks during the 1970s. The Red Brigades'
1978 abduction and murder of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro highlighted
those so-called years of lead. By the early 1980s, police had all but
wiped out the group.</TE>
<TE>   Near Biagi's home Wednesday, neighbors found a five-pointed star, the
Red Brigades' symbol, scratched on a wall. It was not clear when the star
was put there.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal co-authored by Biagi and approved last week by the
Cabinet would suspend for four years an article of Italy's 1970 labor
code that makes it extremely difficult for employers, even in small or
struggling companies, to dismiss workers without "just cause."</TE>
<TE>   Freed of such strictures, employers would be more willing to hire, the
government contends. It says the four-year experiment would reduce
Italy's unemployment rate, which hovers just below 10% and is among the
highest in the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Italy has the worst labor market in Europe, we really have no
alternative" but reform, Biagi wrote in an editorial published on the
front page of Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy's leading business newspaper, on the
day he died.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's three big labor union federations, representing 12 million
workers, have denounced the proposal as a threat to democracy and made it
one of the most divisive issues of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's
9-month-old administration. Union leaders broke off talks with the
government last week.</TE>
<TE>   Berlusconi vowed Wednesday to push the proposal through Parliament,
and some political analysts said he was now in a stronger position to
succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "Berlusconi cannot take any steps back now. Doing so would mean
letting terrorism have the upper hand," said Sergio Romano, a leading
political commentator.</TE>
<TE>   The government planned a state funeral for Biagi.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the three union federations organized a rally in
Bologna, attended by tens of thousands of people, and a two-hour work
stoppage to protest the slaying. But they rejected Berlusconi's appeal to
resume the talks and call off their threatened general strike, saying
they would meet next week to set a date for one.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's turmoil is being watched closely across the European Union,
where laws protecting job security generally are stronger than in the
United States. Leaders of the 15 EU countries, struggling to make the
euro currency more competitive with the dollar, vowed at a summit last
week to make labor markets more flexible.</TE>
<TE>   The European Parliament opened its Wednesday session with a minute's
silence for the slain Italian.</TE>
<TE>   "The construction of a country and of tomorrow's Europe cannot be
achieved in this climate of hate," said European Commission President
Romano Prodi, a Bologna native and friend of Biagi.</TE>

<HD>U.S., Europe to Tout Pledges of Development Aid at Summit</HD>
<DH>Mexico: Bush and other leaders say they want to boost grants to
poor nations by $12 billion a year by 2006.</DH>

<DL>MONTERREY, Mexico
</DL>
<LD>Carrying a sackful of aid promises, President Bush arrives here
today for a global development conference that, in sharp contrast to many
past meetings with lofty goals, may actually accomplish something.</LD>
<LD>   The United States and European nations will use the U.N. Conference on
Financing for Development to tout pledges to raise annual aid to poor
nations by a combined $12 billion by 2006.</LD>
<LD>   Bush will also unveil a new program to promote private investment and
jobs in rural Mexico as a way to discourage illegal immigration, U.S. and
Mexican officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed U.S. and European Union aid increases are a response to
globalization foes who say the benefits of free trade haven't filtered
down to the poor. The increases would constitute a reversal after a
generation of shrinking U.S. aid budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Bush wants to gradually boost aid to poor nations from $10 billion a
year now to $15 billion yearly by 2006; Congress must approve any
increase. The EU announced its commitment to add $7 billion to its annual
aid program at a summit in Barcelona, Spain, last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the proposed aid increases--before a conference whose
theme is how to lift developing nations out of poverty--is no
coincidence, Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are directly linked to the celebration of the summit in
Monterrey," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 60 world leaders are expected at the meeting. Castaneda
attributed the high turnout to nations' eagerness to ratify what is being
called the "Monterrey Consensus," that wealthy countries must do more to
help the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban President Fidel Castro will also attend the conference, but he
and Bush will not meet, the White House said. Castro will arrive this
morning and leave tonight. Bush arrives this afternoon and will stay
through Saturday morning, when he leaves for Lima, the Peruvian capital.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-Mexico rural assistance program, dubbed Partnership for
Prosperity, unites the public and private sectors in developing projects
to help regions of Mexico that haven't benefited from the North American
Free Trade Agreement, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the program, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice
said it is aimed at smoothing out NAFTA's "uneven" economic benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "NAFTA created a tremendous economic boom . . . mostly along the
border states," she said. "And one of [Mexican] President [Vicente] Fox's
concerns has been to take that prosperity and transfer it to the center
of the country and to the south."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference here Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H.
O'Neill cautioned that the Bush administration wants to attach some
strings to its proposed boost in aid to poor nations.</TE>
<TE>   To keep the aid spigot open, the United States wants to be shown
concrete results in terms of higher living standards and incomes, O'Neill
said.</TE>
<TE>   In typically blunt fashion, O'Neill expressed some reservations that
government grants are the best way to help the world's poor.</TE>
<TE>   "The real economic development will come from [investment] capital,"
he said. "We're not going to do it with welfare."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell are heading an effort
to devise benchmarks to prove the effectiveness of poverty aid.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Fox will hold talks Friday that Mexico hopes will result in
U.S. aid for border infrastructure and other programs. Officials of both
countries were reticent Wednesday about what specific help Mexico might
receive.</TE>
<TE>   Asked at a White House briefing Wednesday about criticism that
Washington isn't providing enough foreign aid, Rice argued that in
addition to grants, U.S. assistance comes in the form of military and
security guarantees.</TE>
<TE>   "I say to people that the United States provides for the world a lot
that others do not, including security," she said. "What we're doing to
increase stability and security around the world right now is really
quite remarkable."</TE>
<TE>   At a news briefing here Wednesday, Harvard economics professor Jeffrey
Sachs made the case that improving health care in poor countries plagued
by AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria is the first step to fostering economic
development.</TE>
<TE>   Sachs discussed a recent study that he directed showing that AIDS,
tuberculosis and malaria are blocking chances of economic growth in many
developing countries.</TE>
<TE>   Rich countries should contribute one penny for each $10 of economic
output, an investment that he said would save 8 million lives a year and
generate a 600% return in terms of productivity.</TE>
<TE>   "Monterrey can be a turning point in this division between rich and
poor," he said. "There is nothing more important in economic development
than helping the poor stay alive to become members of productive
society."</TE>
<TE>   One fund set up last April to deliver health care is the Global Fund
to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which commissioned Sachs' study.
Directed by officials at the United Nations' World Health Organization,
the fund has raised nearly $2 billion in less than a year--including $100
million from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The WHO's Andrew Cassels said the fund has gone from "a standing start
to disbursing $700 million" in aid to as many as 50 countries. Its goal
is to disburse 10 times that much in five years.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope people come out of Monterrey thinking that health care isn't
just important in its own right," he said, "but that it's a key strategy
in building a sound economy."</TE>

<HD>Back-Seat Plan Moves to Forefront</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Cheney and other U.S. officials craft a proposal to
jump-start the peace process on a limo ride to Jerusalem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey
</DL>
<LD>In the back seats of the armored Cadillac limousine, Middle East
envoy Anthony C. Zinni, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, an assistant
secretary of State and a senior White House aide were all squeezed in
with Vice President Dick Cheney.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a little crowded," a senior administration official said of
the nearly one-hour ride Monday afternoon over the hills east of Tel
Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport as Cheney made his way to
Jerusalem.</LD>
<LD>   But out of that tight fit came a plan that U.S. officials hope will
calm the immediate conflict between Palestinians and Israelis and put the
longer-range peace process back on track.</LD>
<TE>   By the time Cheney arrived in Jerusalem for a welcome by Ariel Sharon
and, later, a 3 1/2-hour dinner with the hawkish Israeli prime minister,
the group had formulated a proposal that would thrust Cheney into the
role of Middle East motivator.</TE>
<TE>Meeting in Egypt</TE>
<TE>   The plan, which may have Cheney meeting with Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat early next week in Egypt, could also break an
impasse between Arafat and Sharon, whose tanks have kept Arafat confined
to his headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah for three months.</TE>
<TE>   As Cheney returned to Washington on Wednesday after an overnight stay
in Turkey, the fledgling U.S. effort illustrated a foreign policy dynamic
that demands that the Bush administration focus on the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict while seeking support for its effort to
restrain Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The two issues along with the war on terrorism are now three strands
of a braid, ensuring that the Middle East will only grow in prominence on
the administration's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The day-to-day calls in the administration's Middle East work are
being made by Zinni, who will decide when the conditions have been met
for a Cheney-Arafat meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The retired Marine Corps general had returned to the region a week ago
for the first time since early January, when there was no sign that the
violence would abate.</TE>
<TE>   In the Secret Service limousine Monday, Zinni and the others came up
with the conditions that he would take the next morning to Arafat in
Ramallah while Cheney met a second, and then a third, time with Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   It was to these conditions that Arafat would agree: to make what is
being described as a 100% effort to stem the violence, and to finally
implement a long-delayed plan for security cooperation with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, drawn up last year by CIA Director George J. Tenet,
Palestinian and Israeli security officials would cooperate in quelling
the violence and would share intelligence about potential attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Next up: the meeting in Egypt between Arafat and Cheney. It has become
central to the complicated, step-by-step process intended to put Tenet's
plan into effect.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials want Arab leaders to lean on Arafat to comply with the
plan. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who would be the host of the
meeting, is considered vital to the effort to pressure Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   The officials recognize that Arafat cannot entirely control militant
Islamic groups, which they believe are fully prepared to engage in
violence to torpedo any Israeli-Palestinian agreement. Still, the White
House expects him to make more of an effort to stem the violence.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of Arafat's ability to control all the violence flowing from
the Palestinian side against the Israelis, that's become a source of
continuing debate," a senior Bush administration official said. "What we
expect is an all-out effort by the Palestinians to do everything they can
to end the violence."</TE>
<TE>   This allows room for the Bush administration, which for its first 14
months had largely sought to steer clear of the Middle East conflict, to
pressure Israel to adhere to the security plan even if some violence
continues.</TE>
<TE>   By creating conditions under which Arafat could leave Ramallah for the
Cheney meeting early next week, U.S. officials feel that they are making
it easier for Sharon to let Arafat go to Beirut on Wednesday and Thursday
for an Arab League summit.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's attendance at the summit is seen as central to the discussion
of a plan advanced by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah that would resurrect
the "land-for-peace" proposals that have long been part of the Middle
East formula.</TE>
<TE>   If Sharon kept Arafat from the meeting, in the administration's
thinking, the summit would focus on the restrictions placed on him rather
than on the peace plan.</TE>
<TE>Saudi Initiative</TE>
<TE>   Under the crown prince's plan, Saudi Arabia would ease its hostile
relations with Israel--the terms "normalization" of diplomatic relations
and the more ambiguous "full peace" have both been used by Saudi
officials to describe the shift--if the Jewish state gives up the land it
has occupied since the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney had heard private pleas, and sometimes diplomatically awkward
public demands, at virtually every stop in his 11-day trip across the
Mideast that he use his influence with Sharon to let Arafat attend the
summit. Several times during the trip, he spoke with President Bush,
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice about what steps to take.</TE>
<TE>   Those pleas were just part of the regional puzzle: In addition to the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict and Iraq, there were also Washington's
relations with the countries that Cheney visited after his initial stop
in London and the immediate demands of the anti-terrorism campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Each country had its own issue: In Yemen, for example, leaders are
concerned that members of the Al Qaeda terrorist network would seek
refuge in the country's largely ungoverned tribal areas.</TE>
<TE>   And Jordan is emblematic of the need to work all the problems of the
region simultaneously, in the administration's evolving view.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan has for several decades depended on economic help from the
United States. To its northeast sits Iraq, to its west Israel. About 45%
of its population is Palestinian, its king says.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has discovered that to avoid one issue--the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for example--endangers the support it seeks
across the region to succeed in others, such as Iraq and the
anti-terrorism campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   He's the highest-level utility infielder the administration can
deploy, based not just on his title but also on his experience. Bush
assigns him the messiest or most important jobs. Cheney has moved from
energy czar to custodian of the "secure, undisclosed location" that would
serve as an ad hoc capital in case of an attack on Washington. Now he
carries the Middle East portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's new assignment takes advantage of his experience as defense
secretary during the Persian Gulf War 11 years ago, and, in private life,
as the chief executive of the Halliburton Co. As head of the energy
giant, he had developed ties with nearly every leader he has met during
the past week and a half.</TE>
<TE>   So the messages he brings back to Bush likely would carry more weight
than would reports from Zinni or even Powell.</TE>
<TE>   And by next week, he may be offering more.</TE>
<TE>   If Arafat meets the conditions for a meeting with the vice president,
Cheney could be traveling to Egypt as early as Sunday night.</TE>

mistakenly thought to be Al Qaeda or Taliban fighters, the Pentagon said.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve were released after being held for two weeks on suspicion that
they were Iranians trying to destabilize the Afghan government. The

<LD>An explosion outside the U.S. Embassy in Lima, Peru's capital,
killed at least four people, local media reported. The blast comes three
days before President Bush's visit.</LD>

<HD>Despite Deadly Bombing, Talks on Track in Israel</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Israel says it won't retaliate for the suicide attack that
killed seven people. The Palestinian Authority denounces the violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli and Palestinian officials forged ahead in cease-fire talks
Wednesday despite the killing of seven people by a Palestinian suicide
bomber who boarded a crowded bus at rush hour and blew himself up.</LD>
<LD>   The deadly attack dealt a blow to efforts by U.S. envoy Anthony C.
Zinni to push the two sides into a truce. It brought an angry
denunciation from Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon but, in the end,
did not derail a key round of negotiations Wednesday evening. Israeli
officials said they would refrain from major retaliation for the time
being.</LD>
<LD>   The negotiations adjourned just before midnight Wednesday with no
announcement but an agreement to meet again.</LD>
<TE>   Momentum for a cease-fire had built with the daylong visit Tuesday of
Vice President Dick Cheney, who signaled to Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat that he will be rewarded with a meeting if he
makes a 100% effort to stop the violence.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps with that in mind, the Palestinian Authority condemned the
Wednesday morning bus bombing and ordered attacks on civilians inside
Israel to halt "despite the bleeding wounds of Palestinian civilians."
The Palestinian statement said that Arafat's efforts to end Israeli
blockades of Palestinian territory are undermined by suicide bombings and
other attacks on Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>Sharon Blames Arafat</TE>
<TE>   The radical Islamic Jihad, which opposes peace with Israel, claimed
responsibility for the blast near the northern Israeli Arab town of Umm
al Fahm. But Sharon blamed Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are seeing is that Arafat has not strayed from his policy of
terror at this stage," Sharon said after a meeting with his security
Cabinet. "He has not yet taken any step . . . and this is, of course,
something that we view as very grave."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said that he had consulted with Zinni and that the two men see
"eye to eye" on the matter. Still, a senior Israeli official said his
country would react to the bombing with restraint to avoid being seen as
the party driving an escalation in the violence.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, that is Zinni's most daunting challenge: to prevent another
lurch in the cycle of attack and revenge. That means persuading Sharon
and Israel to refrain from military reprisal, while trying to prevent
additional Palestinian attacks. Every previous cease-fire
agreement--there have been about nine in the past 18 months--has fallen
victim to a spiral of retaliatory bloodshed that has fueled the deadliest
fighting here in decades.</TE>
<TE>   "This morning's attack was severe," Defense Minister Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer said. "But Israelis and Palestinians are in the midst of
getting a cease-fire on track. We must not stop. On the contrary, we must
hasten this process, in spite of the pain."</TE>
<TE>   Zinni met with Arafat a few hours after the explosion to review a
cease-fire plan first put forth last summer by CIA Director George J.
Tenet. It was the subject of the high-level security meetings late
Wednesday, reportedly at the home of U.S. Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer in
a Tel Aviv suburb. Participants included Zinni and two top security
officials from each side.</TE>
<TE>   Nabil Shaath, a minister in Arafat's government, said the Palestinians
will continue to insist that security talks are coupled with political
ones. "If Israel does not withdraw its forces and lift its closure, we
are not going to engage in security arrangements," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if a cease-fire is declared, there is little hope here that it
will substantially change the basic dynamics of a conflict that has
claimed more than 1,500 lives.</TE>
<TE>   The Tenet plan calls for Israel to pull its troops back to positions
held in the West Bank and Gaza Strip before September 2000, the start of
the current Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule. Sharon is
reluctant to order that extensive a withdrawal because it would mean
dismantling numerous military installations that Israel says provide
security but that have carved up Palestinian territory.</TE>
<TE>   Under the same plan, Palestinian authorities would be required to
arrest militants and confiscate illegal arms--steps that Arafat is
reluctant to take, especially given the power and influence of armed
militias that have varying degrees of loyalty to the Palestinian leader.</TE>
<TE>   If a cease-fire is declared under the Tenet guidelines, Israelis and
Palestinians would gradually move into peace talks under the auspices of
a plan drafted last year by an international panel led by former Sen.
George J. Mitchell (D-Maine).</TE>
<TE>   But after the fighting of the last year and a half, the suicide
bombings that have killed dozens of Jews and Israel's devastating raids
into Palestinian refugee camps and cities, the repository of hatred is so
great that neither side has much faith that the other will comply with a
cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Even Israel's optimistic foreign minister, Shimon Peres, said
Wednesday that any cease-fire would not be "hermetic or
comprehensive"--meaning, violence will continue.</TE>
<TE>   The latest carnage was on bus No. 823 traveling from Tel Aviv to
Nazareth in northern Israel. It was the third time that this route, which
crosses land dotted by Israeli Arab villages, has been attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Seven people, including four soldiers, were killed along with the
bomber. Two of the civilians who were killed were identified as Mogus
Mahaneto, 75, and Alon Goldenberg, 28. The third will require DNA testing
to be identified, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Almost every passenger on the bus was hurt, a total of more than 30
people suffering from burns, severed limbs and cuts. The injured included
Israeli Arabs; other passengers were Jews traveling at the start of
Passover vacations.</TE>
<TE>Soldier Eyed Bomber</TE>
<TE>   The bomber, identified later as 24-year-old Rifat abu Diak, from a
village near the West Bank town of Jenin, boarded the bus at Umm al Fahm.
He argued briefly with the driver, Yossi Ben-Yosef, who questioned Abu
Diak but then decided that he wasn't suspicious and allowed him to move
to the back of the bus.</TE>
<TE>   Soldier Vadim Weinfus said he watched the Palestinian man as he
boarded the bus with two older Arab men. When Abu Diak sat, Weinfus
noticed something in his coat. The soldier immediately grabbed his gun
and started to load a magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw that he was arguing with the man next to him," Weinfus told
reporters. "I saw the uncomfortable expression on the face of the other
man, and just as I was about to put the magazine in my gun to somehow
stop him, he blew himself up."</TE>
<TE>   One passenger, Liraz Shiron, told Israeli television that the bomber
looked at her and smiled before detonating explosives strapped to his
waist.</TE>
<TE>   Bodies were hurled through the windows of the bus. The dead and dying
lay on the pavement or were trapped inside the crumpled vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Some Jewish passengers said they used the route because they thought
that the certain presence of Israeli Arabs made a Palestinian attack less
likely.</TE>
<TE>   But Kamla Masalha, a 40-year-old nurse and Israeli Arab who was
wounded in the explosion, said bombers don't distinguish between Jew and
Arab. "Every morning I travel with fear," she told Israeli radio from her
hospital bed. "They do not care who you are."</TE>

<HD>A Matzo Airlift and More</HD>
<DH>Religion: Importing the kosher bread is part of one ultra-Orthodox
group's efforts to revive Judaism in the former Soviet Union.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>At age 8, Itzak Kogan was up to his arms in illegal flour, helping
his mother bake matzo, which was banned in the Soviet Union.</LD>
<LD>   Even after it became legal in the 1960s, supplies were short. As a
rabbi in Leningrad in the 1970s, Kogan traveled to the Soviet republic of
Georgia to bake 1,100 pounds of the flat, unleavened bread, because
Russian flour was unsuitable for making kosher matzo.</LD>
<LD>   To get the large cargo home without risking difficulties with police,
family members split it up and flew it to Leningrad, now St. Petersburg.</LD>
<TE>Bread Abounds Today</TE>
<TE>   But in Moscow today, the bread abounds. Billboards urge Russians to
buy genuine Israeli matzo. The campaign is sponsored by the
ultra-Orthodox Chabad Lubavitch movement, which is importing 1.2 million
pounds of it into the former U.S.S.R. for the coming Passover holiday.
The matzo airlift is just one part of the group's efforts to revive
Judaism in the former Soviet Union, where even practices such as kosher
butchering were once seen as threats to the state.</TE>
<TE>   After becoming a rabbi, Kogan had to learn the complicated rituals of
kosher slaughtering--which was illegal--because there was no kosher meat
available in Leningrad. He killed chickens secretly in his house or at
his country cottage. He and his followers would slaughter cows in rural
fields among high grass, where no one could see them.</TE>
<TE>   But the KGB knew everything. Kogan's KGB minder, Alexander Belayev,
was warned by his superiors to watch Kogan closely because of his strong
"anti-Soviet" activities.</TE>
<TE>   Kogan worked at a military plant, and Belayev informed management
there that Kogan was involved in underground kosher slaughtering. But the
rabbi had softened up his bosses by bringing them cheap chicken whenever
he failed to follow the correct ritual in killing a bird.</TE>
<TE>   His superiors took no action against him. He set up an underground
butcher school to teach men the rituals so that cities all over Russia
could have kosher meat. Kogan, now a leading Chabad rabbi, also performed
circumcisions, weddings and other rituals in secret. Risking prison, he
ran an underground Jewish school.</TE>
<TE>   Chabad Lubavitch is the fastest-growing movement promoting the revival
of Judaism in the former U.S.S.R., marking its progress not only in
pounds of matzo sold but also in the dozens of schools, community centers
and orphanages it has opened. It has 3,200 workers in the former Soviet
Union, plus 70 kindergartens, 64 schools, three orphanages and community
centers or synagogues in 70 cities.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the movement is holding public Seders for 250,000 Russians.
The feast commemorates the exodus of the Jews from Egypt, and it is
celebrated on the first night or the first two nights of eight days of
Passover. The unleavened matzo is eaten to commemorate the Israelites who
fled quickly into the desert with no time for their breads to rise and
were forced to bake the dough into hard crackers in the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Because the matzo is often bought by non-practicing Jewish families,
the box includes an explanation of Passover and instructions on which
blessings to pronounce upon the matzo, what foods should be prepared for
Passover and what each symbolizes.</TE>
<TE>Reviving an Identity</TE>
<TE>   Russia is fertile ground for the Lubavitch movement. The nation is
home to an estimated 600,000 Jews, most of whom had no spiritual
connection with Judaism during the Soviet years, nor an appreciation of
the nuances of Judaism and the differences among ultra-Orthodox, Orthodox
or Reform strands of the religion.</TE>
<TE>   In Soviet times, most Jews were either non-practicing, atheists or
converts to the Russian Orthodox Church, and the majority remain so.</TE>
<TE>   But being Jewish was an inescapable part of their identity, emblazoned
on their passports under "nationality." Jews faced barriers in higher
education and the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   Lubavitchers insist that their motive in the former Soviet Union is
not to attract Jews to their own ultra-Orthodox movement but to revive
people's Jewish identity. However, they focus on young people and are
eager to enroll children in Lubavitch schools.</TE>
<TE>   The movement takes its name from Lyubavichy, near Smolensk, west of
Moscow, the village where the movement was based from 1813 to 1915,
spreading to other nations. On Sunday, the group will mark 100 years
since the birth of the last Lubavitch rebbe, the charismatic Rabbi
Menachem Schneerson, who died in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The Chabad push back into Russia since the collapse of communism has
generated controversy and split the nation's Jewish community. The
Lubavitch-dominated Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia sparked
bitterness and anger when it elected Berel Lazar as chief rabbi of the
country in 2000 to compete with Russia's existing chief rabbi, Adolf
Shayevich, from a broader Jewish organization, the Russian Jewish
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The Kremlin has embraced Lazar as though he represented all Russian
Jews, further exacerbating the tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Lubavitch Rabbi Avraham Berkowitz of Moscow contends that one reason
the movement has been successful in Russia is that Lubavitchers are
willing to give up the comforts of a Western lifestyle for a harsh life
in the provinces of Russia, Ukraine and other former republics.</TE>
<TE>   "A Lubavitcher looks at a privileged life as being not about how
luxurious his car is but about his spiritual life and how much he can
accomplish," he said. "We're not afraid to go into the trenches. It
doesn't bother us that in summer there's no hot water in the shower."</TE>
<TE>   Kogan's story typifies the values of the movement. He spent 14 years
trying to escape from the Soviet Union, only to return three years after
he succeeded in emigrating.</TE>
<TE>'Terrifying' to Return</TE>
<TE>   He had been forbidden to emigrate because of his job as an engineer on
systems for nuclear submarines, but his "anti-Soviet activities" were
another factor.</TE>
<TE>   When he was finally allowed to emigrate to Israel in 1986, he lived
there only a year before Schneerson urged him to return. Coming back two
years later was "terrifying," Kogan recalled. Kogan came back to violence
in Russia, where there have been numerous attacks and bombings targeting
Jews.</TE>
<TE>   The 56-year-old rabbi keeps several thick black pipes in his
office--pieces of a homemade bomb found in his synagogue in 1999. At the
time, the rabbi and an assistant moved the bomb out onto the street.
Police were called and the device was detonated under controlled
conditions. An explosion had occurred at the synagogue in 1993. No one
was hurt in either incident.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Kogan settled in Moscow, he was invited for a meeting with
his old KGB minder, Belayev, the man who had devoted his life to tracing
Kogan's every step.</TE>
<TE>   Belayev was a broken man, living in poverty in a small apartment. He
told Kogan that his superiors always exhorted him to be vigilant against
Kogan. They vowed that Kogan would never be allowed to leave the country.</TE>
<TE>   When Kogan got his exit visa, Belayev felt that his entire KGB career
had been wasted. He resigned and went back to the job he was originally
trained for, a lathe operator.</TE>
<TE>   "He apologized to me and asked for my forgiveness," Kogan said. "He
told me he quit his work after I left because for him that symbolized the
failure of everything he had worked for."</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Twenty-three sailors in the stricken Kursk submarine may have
suffered through three days of agony in freezing darkness, waiting to be
rescued, a senior Russian admiral said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I personally think that life in the ninth compartment came to an end
on the third day," Vice Adm. Vladislav Ilyin, the first deputy chief of
the Russian navy's staff, said at a news conference.</LD>
<LD>   His statement contradicted the conclusion of the prosecutor general's
investigation, which said that sailors in the stern could have lived only
several hours before succumbing to fumes after the two explosions that
sank the vessel in August 2000. All 118 crew members died.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the crewmen were killed instantly by the blasts. However, 23
crewmen remained alive for at least several hours, according to letters
found later by rescuers.</TE>
<TE>   The government hesitated for several days before accepting foreign
aid, even as Russian submersibles were unsuccessful in opening the escape
hatch. When foreign divers reached the Kursk more than a week after the
catastrophe, it took them only hours to open it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's even more painful to hear that 23 people might have survived for
three days, and they failed to rescue even one of them," said Anatoly
Safonov, whose son, Lt. Maxim Safonov, died aboard the Kursk.</TE>

<LD>A Chinese court convicted an American engineer of bribery and
obtaining state secrets and sentenced him today to five years in prison,
the U.S. Embassy here said.</LD>
<LD>   The case of Fong Fuming of West Orange, N.J., is one of several cases
of American citizens, permanent U.S. residents and scholars whose arrests
on security-related charges have produced friction between Beijing and
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. Embassy official and a member of Fong's family were present at
the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate Court for the sentencing, which stipulated
that Fong will be deported when he completes his jail term. Fong was
first detained in February 2000 during a business trip to China, and his
time in custody will be subtracted from his sentence, the embassy said.</LD>
<TE>   Fong was acquitted of several lesser bribery and state secrets
charges.</TE>
<TE>   He was not indicted until September, and U.S. officials allege that
his time in custody violated China's legal limits on detention without
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese officials have said that the sensitive nature of Fong's case
prompted extensions. Another factor was the fate--still unknown--of the
Chinese officials accused of receiving the bribes and leaking the
secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Fong's trial was held in October, just after President Bush visited
China.</TE>
<TE>   "The trial went all day, and the court was impressed by the spirited
defense put up by the Chinese lawyers Fong had retained," said Jerome
Cohen, Fong's New York-based lawyer and a scholar of the Chinese legal
system.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen described the state secrets charges as flawed. Prosecutors
"never examined court documents with an eye to determining whether or not
they were state secrets, and they didn't even know what some of the
documents were," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the bribery charges, Cohen said, "It isn't enough to show that
money passed between person A and person B, it could have passed for many
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "If businessmen can't rely on the promise of the Chinese government
that the laws will be followed, it's going to make lot of people
insecure."</TE>
<TE>   A former top engineer of the Zhejiang provincial energy bureau, Fong
denied charges that he had paid bribes of $245,000 while conducting
business with former associates there. Cohen said that Fong was the
victim of an extortion attempt by one of his erstwhile colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, Fong moved to the U.S., where he worked as a
consultant to several multinational energy companies. He became a U.S.
citizen in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   While in jail, Fong has suffered from spinal ailments and is in a
state of depression, Cohen said.</TE>

<HD>Pentagon Falters in Evidence of Possible Al Qaeda Link to Somalia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>It sounded sinister at first. The Pentagon announced new evidence
of a possible link between the Al Qaeda terrorist network and Somalia.
But soon the story began to unravel.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon's military spokesman for the war in Afghanistan, Air
Force Brig. Gen. John W. Rosa Jr., announced Wednesday that U.S. forces
searching caves abandoned by Al Qaeda in eastern Afghanistan had
recovered a hand-held navigation device Monday with the name "G. Gordon"
on it.</LD>
<LD>   Rosa said the Pentagon believed that it once belonged to Master Sgt.
Gary I. Gordon, an Army Ranger killed in Mogadishu, the Somalian capital,
in October 1993.</LD>
<TE>   "This piece we currently think originated from Somalia will obviously
tie--could obviously tie--Al Qaeda to Somalia," Rosa said.</TE>
<TE>   An alternative explanation, he said, was that the device might have
been stolen and sold on the black market.</TE>
<TE>   But the Pentagon said later that the receiver bearing the name of "G.
Gordon" belonged to another U.S. soldier and had nothing to do with Gary
I. Gordon or Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   "Initial indications that the GPS unit potentially belonged to a U.S.
service member killed in Somalia several years ago have now been
determined to be inaccurate," the Pentagon said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the unit was left on an Afghan battlefield March 4 by a U.S.
soldier who was caught in a firefight with Al Qaeda forces at the outset
of Operation Anaconda.</TE>
<TE>   The Global Positioning System device was brought to Afghanistan
earlier in the war by a U.S. Army aviator, who handed it off to the
second soldier and then left the country. The device and its pouch had
"G. Gordon" written on them because the soldier who originally brought it
to Afghanistan uses that as his nickname--people say he resembles G.
Gordon Liddy, the Watergate figure.</TE>
<TE>   An Army Times reporter, Sean Naylor, was with the U.S. forces who
recovered the GPS device Monday. Naylor recorded the model and serial
number. His newspaper checked that information with the manufacturer,
Garmin International, which said that the model, GPS III Pilot, was made
no earlier than 1997 and that the item was sold Dec. 21, 1998, to Ft.
Campbell, the Army post in Kentucky that is home to the 101st Airborne
Division, the 5th Special Forces Group and the 160th Special Operations
Aviation Regiment.</TE>
<TE>   "That product didn't exist in 1993," Garmin spokesman Pete Brumbaugh
said by telephone.</TE>
<TE>   The Army Times' managing editor, Robert Hodierne, said Naylor reported
that the soldiers who found the GPS unit also found two others at the
same location. Two of the three had names on them. One was "G. Gordon."
The other was "Svitak." Army Sgt. Philip J. Svitak was among seven U.S.
servicemen killed March 4 when hostile fire brought down one Chinook
helicopter and damaged another. Svitak was a member of the 160th Special
Operations Aviation Regiment from Ft. Campbell.</TE>
<TE>   The soldier who lost the "G. Gordon" device survived the battle, a
defense official said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Before making its announcement Wednesday, the Pentagon notified Gary
I. Gordon's family of the GPS discovery. Gordon, a native of Lincoln,
Maine, was a sniper team leader when he was killed in a Mogadishu
firefight Oct. 3, 1993.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration sent a strong message to North Korea on
Wednesday in deciding that the U.S. cannot be sure whether the government
in Pyongyang, the capital, is adhering to a 1994 agreement that froze its
nuclear weapons program.</LD>
<LD>   The White House opted to tell Congress that it cannot "certify" North
Korea on compliance--as Congress requires before releasing money for aid
to North Korea--because it is not satisfied that Pyongyang is serious
about making new nuclear inspection arrangements, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   But the administration gave the North Koreans some respite, waiving
the congressional requirement on national security grounds and agreeing
to press on with its side of the agreement by shipping 500,000 tons of
fuel oil this year to North Korea.</LD>
<TE>   The deliveries are to continue until two light-water nuclear reactors
are installed in North Korea. The reactors are not of a type that can
produce weapons-grade plutonium.</TE>

<HD>Treason Case Lands Mugabe Foe in Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai appeared in court on treason
charges and was granted bail Wednesday as Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe faced mounting pressure over his reelection in balloting that was
widely seen as fraudulent.</LD>
<LD>   Tsvangirai's court appearance dashed international hopes that Mugabe,
accused of stealing victory in last week's voting, had been persuaded by
Nigeria and South Africa to explore a power-sharing deal with his rival.</LD>
<LD>   Tsvangirai, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change who had
challenged Mugabe for the presidency, was ordered to court a day after
the Commonwealth suspended Zimbabwe for a year on grounds that the
election had not been free and fair.</LD>
<TE>   The Commonwealth made clear that its sanction was focused on Mugabe
and the political leadership by inviting Zimbabwe to the Commonwealth
Games, to be held in Manchester, England, in July.</TE>
<TE>   Tsvangirai was named before the election in a treason inquiry linked
to a secretly filmed video purporting to show him discussing Mugabe's
assassination.</TE>
<TE>   Tsvangirai has said the tape was doctored to misrepresent his
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   The court set bail of about $27,000, with a further surety of property
title deeds worth at least $54,000. Tsvangirai was told to surrender his
passport to police.</TE>
<TE>   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who announced the Commonwealth
suspension in London on Tuesday, told reporters after a meeting with
British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw on Wednesday that he was worried
about the action against Tsvangirai.</TE>
<TE>   "Any notion of the prosecution of the opposition leader in Zimbabwe is
quite inimical to the prospect of national reconciliation," Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Olusegun Obasanjo of
Nigeria met Mugabe and Tsvangirai separately Monday, trying to persuade
them to work together for Zimbabwe's political and economic recovery.</TE>

<HD>'Insufficient Evidence' Ends Whitewater Case</HD>
<DH>Law: The report ends a costly, lengthy inquiry of the Clintons. The
outside counsel says no charges will be filed but calls allegations
'credible.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<AU>ROBERT L. JACKSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>After seven years and $70 million, the Whitewater independent
counsel said Wednesday there was insufficient evidence that former
President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, did anything
illegal or profited from a looted Arkansas savings and loan institution.</LD>
<LD>   Counsel Robert W. Ray said his office would not bring criminal charges
on any of the long list of allegations that were pursued by him and his
predecessor, Kenneth W. Starr.</LD>
<LD>   His final report brings an inconclusive end to one of the most costly,
confusing and controversial investigations in American history.</LD>
<TE>   The Whitewater issue dogged Clinton during his 1992 run for the
presidency, and the criminal probe loomed over the White House for most
of his time there.</TE>
<TE>   It led directly to his impeachment in 1998, even though the
allegations lodged against him had nothing to do with the Arkansas
financial fraud that started it all.</TE>
<TE>   The Whitewater investigation proved to be a disappointment to
Clinton's critics, while his supporters viewed it as an infuriating abuse
of power.</TE>
<TE>   Ray, who is running for the Republican Senate nomination in New
Jersey, lauded the fairness and thoroughness of his office. He said his
investigators examined 10 million pages of documents and interviewed
under oath more than 3,000 witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Ray also defended the man he succeeded. "No more decent individual
graced this office" than Kenneth W. Starr, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The allegations [against the Clintons] were credible, substantial and
required a thorough investigation to resolve them," Ray wrote. "Indeed,
the principal value of the independent counsel law was to ensure public
acceptance of a decision not to prosecute. This does not mean that the
impetus for the investigation was 'bogus' or that the allegations were a
'fraud.' "</TE>
<TE>   He was responding to President Clinton's labeling of the Whitewater
probe as "bogus from day one" and "a fraud."</TE>
<TE>'The Most Expensive Exoneration in History'</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Clintons' attorney, David Kendall, called Ray's
final report "the most expensive exoneration in history. . . . It ends as
it began: with no evidence of wrongdoing by the Clintons."</TE>
<TE>   At its start, the Whitewater probe began with a simple query.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, Clinton, then Arkansas' 32-year-old state attorney general,
was running for governor, and he agreed to invest in a real estate
venture being put together by James B. McDougal, a small-town banker. The
idea was to sell lots for vacation homes along the Whitewater River in
the Arkansas Ozarks. Until that point, their small real estate deals had
proved to be profitable.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, McDougal took over a federally insured savings and loan,
named it Madison Guaranty, and then drove it into bankruptcy. He used
money from Madison for a series of real estate loans for himself and his
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the investments, including Whitewater Corp., lost money. Few
of the lots were selling, and the Clintons were forced to put up more
money to keep the venture alive. McDougal was anxious to keep Whitewater
afloat, since it was to his benefit to have the governor as a business
partner.</TE>
<TE>   By 1986, however, Madison Guaranty was hopelessly insolvent, and
McDougal was removed. Its collapse eventually cost taxpayers $73 million.</TE>
<TE>   So, when Clinton ran for the presidency in 1992, the question arose:
Did the Clintons know about McDougal's scams and did they illegally
benefit from them?</TE>
<TE>   Ray's five-volume final report is notable mostly for what he did not
find.</TE>
<TE>   Repeatedly, he concluded there was "insufficient evidence to prove"
that Bill or Hillary Clinton knew of McDougal's improper dealings or
benefited illegally from them.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton denied under oath that he knew McDougal had funneled some of
Madison's assets into the Whitewater Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   There also were unproved allegations that Madison Guaranty funds had
been used to support Clinton's run for the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of Starr's probe, McDougal and his wife, Susan, were
convicted of fraud and conspiracy in 1996 and sent to prison. Clinton,
testifying at trial on their behalf, sought to distance himself from any
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "Insufficient evidence exists to establish beyond a reasonable doubt
that either Governor or Mrs. Clinton knowingly participated in the
criminal financial transactions used by McDougal," Ray's report said.</TE>
<TE>   A large part of the investigation focused on a questionable $300,000
federally backed loan that former Municipal Judge David Hale claimed he
was pressured by Clinton to make to Susan McDougal. Hale at the time
headed a small venture capital firm known as Capital Management Services
that was backed by the Small Business Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Hale and James McDougal both testified that Clinton knew about and
approved of the decision to have Capital Management make the fraudulent
loan, but in view of Clinton's denial "the independent counsel concluded
that this evidence was insufficient to warrant prosecution of President
Clinton because the evidence did not establish [his] knowing
participation in a criminal scheme," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Ray comes closest to implicating the Clintons directly in his probe of
Hillary Clinton's legal work at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark.
She worked on several land transactions that were later exposed as
questionable. But Ray could not show that Clinton knew the Whitewater
deal was suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   Ray also failed to resolve a central mystery of the investigation: how
Clinton's subpoenaed law firm's records ended up in an upstairs office at
the White House. She testified that she did not know how the long-missing
records got there. Ray cites three people who said they saw her carrying
a box that "had the appearance of the billing records." But there it
ends.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton, now a Democratic U.S. senator from New York, refused to
comment separately on Ray's final report.</TE>
<TE>Inquiry Directly Led to Impeachment</TE>
<TE>   While trying in vain to catch the Clintons in wrongdoing, the
Whitewater investigation netted plenty of little fish and a few large
ones. And the probe ultimately led to President Clinton's impeachment.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1998, when Starr's pursuit had reached something of a dead
end, his office received a call from Linda Tripp, the Pentagon employee
who had been taping her phone calls with former White House intern Monica
S. Lewinsky.</TE>
<TE>   Tripp said she was a "witness" and was being threatened. She had
tipped the Dallas lawyers representing Paula Corbin Jones in her sexual
harassment case to Lewinsky's secret affair with Clinton. And they in
turn asked Tripp and Lewinsky to file sworn statements.</TE>
<TE>   Tripp said Lewinsky was urging her not to reveal what she knew. So, to
prevent this potential witness tampering and obstruction of justice, the
independent counsel put aside Whitewater and took on the Lewinsky case.</TE>
<TE>   Nine months later, Starr told the House of Representatives and the
world that the president should be impeached.</TE>

<HD>Brothers Stunned by Their New Success in Taser Trade</HD>
<DH>Security: Since Sept. 11, the weapons no longer are just obscure
law enforcement devices. United Airlines bought 1,300 units for its
fleet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.
</DL>
<LD>If fear of domestic terrorism threatens to transform America into
an armed camp, Tom Smith and his brother want to be the ones to arm it.</LD>
<LD>   The Smiths run Taser International, the world's leading manufacturer
of stun guns. The Taser has in recent days ceased to be an obscure law
enforcement device and is poised to make it big, selling to consumers and
private security companies, and now the airline industry.</LD>
<LD>   The brothers, after nearly a decade of financial woes and legal
battles, are ready to cash in.</LD>
<TE>   Sales since Sept. 11 have increased 167%. The company just filled an
order for United Airlines for 1,300 Tasers. The carrier wants to place
the stun guns in the cockpits of its 600 jetliners. Over-the-counter
sales to the public are suddenly brisk, and the company is planning its
first mass advertising campaign.</TE>
<TE>   With few restrictions on their sale, stun guns soon may become for
today's security-conscious citizens what pepper spray was 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Smith can hardly fathom the company's transformation. "There were
times we paid our payroll on credit cards," he said. "And those were all
maxed out."</TE>
<TE>   Smith and his brother Rick--both former medical students--picked up
the shards of a defunct business in 1993 and began making Tasers after
two friends were shot to death in a road rage incident. The murders made
them think about personal safety for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The more they investigated, the more clear it became that there was a
void in the market for those who didn't want to use a firearm for
self-defense. The answer, they found, was a stun gun, which subdues its
target for as long as 90 seconds by emitting powerful electrical shocks
that overwhelm a person's central nervous system.</TE>
<TE>   The Smiths decided to get into the business. The first thing they did
was seek out the retired NASA scientist who invented the technology for
the Taser in the '70s. The scientist, Jack Cover, remembered a stun gun
he had read about in the Tom Swift fantasy stories of his youth. He even
created the acronym TASER from "Thomas A. Swift Electrical Rifle."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Smith, newly graduated from Harvard, paired with Cover full time
to update and refine the technology. Tom Smith, with an MBA from Northern
Arizona University, held down a day job and at night worked on
structuring the company.</TE>
<TE>   The first order of business was to change the Taser's triggering
mechanism. The old model used gunpowder, so it was classified as a
firearm, which required a license to buy--considered off-putting to some
consumers. To reach a broader market, the Smiths adopted a new system
using compressed gas.</TE>
<TE>   That accomplished, the brothers hired an electronic engineer and gave
him the task of designing a prototype. It took a year.</TE>
<TE>   Looking much like a conventional handgun, the barrel of a Taser is
fitted with a special cartridge. When the trigger is pulled, compressed
nitrogen propels two metal darts at 100 mph. Once attached to the target,
the probes send out an electrical charge that the company says penetrates
up to 2 inches of clothing or padding.</TE>
<TE>   The Taser incapacitates a person by emitting pulses of
electricity--50,000 volts--that override the person's central nervous
system. The shocks are discharged in extremely short bursts and last a
total of about five seconds. Someone subdued by a stun gun falls to the
ground, muscles convulsing, with no body control.</TE>
<TE>   While there are a handful of companies around the world that make stun
guns, each uses unique technology.</TE>
<TE>   During development of the Taser, money was streaming out of the
company and none was coming in. The investors--the Smith brothers, their
father and his friend--were taking a beating.</TE>
<TE>   "From 1993 to 2001, we only had two months where we had the
end-of-the-month payroll covered at the start of the month," said Tom
Smith, 34. "I can tell you, that's a tough way to live."</TE>
<TE>   Just about the time the company and its new product were ready to
enter the all-important law enforcement market in 1995, the Smiths hit a
snag. Taser International and another company, Tasertron, had licensing
agreements with Cover, who holds patents on much of the technology.</TE>
<TE>   The Tasertron company believed it had secured exclusive rights to
market its product to law enforcement and the military. Taser
International believed it had an unrestricted license to sell to anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Tasertron filed suit. Smith said he didn't have enough money to fight
back, leading the two companies to agree that Taser International would
stay out of the law enforcement and military market until February 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't worry too much because we thought the consumer market would
be pretty good," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Their early, low-power model, Air Taser, was sold at stores such as
the Sharper Image. But Smith discovered that consumers would not buy
Tasers until they were used and endorsed by police officers.</TE>
<TE>   Shut out of the market that would give it credibility, the company
foundered. To save money, the Smiths moved manufacturing to Mexico, and
cut their work force from 80 people to 12.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of that financial morass, the Smiths made what proved to
be a disastrous decision: producing the Auto Taser, essentially an
electrified "Club" steering wheel lock.</TE>
<TE>   "No one bought it," Smith said, still mystified. "My brother started
calling it the Bearded Lady: Everyone wanted to look at it and no one
would take it home."</TE>
<TE>   Three times the company appeared headed into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as if to confirm the brothers' rotten timing, just as they
prepared to take the company public two years ago, the bottom fell out of
the dot-com world and venture capital dried up overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "We were meeting with people just as Nasdaq fell. We had to pull
brokers from under desks to talk to us," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they prevailed. Taser's stock rose 180% in its first year. This
week, it surged 13% after an analyst touted the company in a business
publication.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the attention from United's purchase has caused the company
to accelerate plans to move strongly into the consumer market. Now
available in fewer than 100 stores nationwide, the company expects Tasers
to be sold in an additional 500 stores by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer model costs about $120; the law enforcement model about
$600.</TE>
<TE>   Tasers are standard issue for more than 1,000 police departments
around the country, and the Smiths now dominate the market they once were
forbidden to explore.</TE>
<TE>   "After Sept. 11, the phones have been ringing off the hook," said
Jason Woodside, owner of the International Spy Shop in San Francisco,
which sells two models of Tasers. "A lot of guys buy them for their wives
before they go on trips. I've sold a few to jewelry store owners. For
people into self-defense who are not comfortable killing people, this is
the thing."</TE>
<TE>   From a nondescript suburban industrial park here, the 1-pound weapons
are shipped to customers in 60 countries. The Smiths' work force, made up
entirely of Serbian war refugees relocated here by church groups, each
day turns out about 150 Tasers and thousands of rounds of ammunition
cartridges.</TE>
<TE>   The company projects record sales of about $12 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew there was a market out there," Smith said. "There were many
nights when Rick and I were here, filling orders at midnight and drinking
beers, saying, 'What are we doing?' There were some dark days. I guess
it's all been worth it."</TE>

<LD>Miami Beach city commissioners voted to ban "camping in public

<LD>   Commissioner Luis Garcia said the city hoped to improve the overall
quality of life by keeping the homeless and others, such as intoxicated
revelers, off the streets.</LD>
<LD>   Police officers must offer violators a chance to stay in a homeless
shelter, and those who refuse can be arrested or fined.</LD>

<HD>Democrat Tars Rival in Ill. Race for Governor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Rep. Rod Blagojevich will try to become the first Democrat to win
the Illinois governor's office in 30 years in part by linking his
opponent, Republican Jim Ryan, to a bribery scandal involving the
outgoing GOP governor.</LD>
<LD>   While Ryan began trying to unify his fractured party Wednesday,
Blagojevich referred to the federal investigation of the trading of
driver's licenses for bribes during Gov. George Ryan's tenure as
secretary of state.</LD>
<LD>   Blagojevich (pronounced blah-GOY'-uh-vich) said Jim Ryan, the state
attorney general, had evidence of the scandal as early as 1997 but did
nothing about it.</LD>
<TE>   "He looked the other way on corruption," Blagojevich said, calling his
opponent "asleep at the switch."</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors say about $170,000 of bribe money ended up in Gov.
Ryan's campaign fund. The governor has not been charged with wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Ryan, who is not related to the governor, has said it would have
been irresponsible to interfere in a federal investigation. He said
Wednesday that his opponents tried to raise the issue in the primary "and
the voters didn't buy it."</TE>
<TE>   He also took a poke at Blagojevich, who like Ryan was a Golden Gloves
boxer in his youth.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll remind you that Rod fought in the Golden Gloves, and I won in
the Golden Gloves," Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois is one of 36 states holding elections for governor this year
and one of 17 states in which the incumbent isn't running.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats hope to win here by capitalizing on the sitting governor's
woes. Republicans, worried about losing control of the state House and
Senate, see the race as their best bet at keeping some hold over the
state.</TE>
<TE>   The two candidates present a stark ideological contrast for Illinois
voters, who are known for picking governors who are close to the
political middle.</TE>
<TE>   Blagojevich is a liberal anti-gun crusader who supports abortion
rights, while Ryan opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest and
would not back additional restrictions on gun owners.</TE>
<TE>   Both will have to overcome weaknesses exposed during expensive and
bruising campaigns before Tuesday's primaries, from Ryan's supposed ties
to the bribery scandal to Blagojevich's collection of legal fees while he
held a full-time job as a congressman from Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Blagojevich squeaked by his two opponents with 37% of the vote,
winning largely on the support of labor unions and Democratic chairmen
outside Chicago. Ryan had a much easier time, taking 45% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans hadn't seen a contested governor's primary in decades, and
the infighting took its toll on the party. Ryan's opponents battered him
on the bribery scandal and his handling of a 1983 murder case when he was
DuPage County prosecutor. Three men went to prison--one to death row--but
were later released amid questions about the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Patrick O'Malley was far from conciliatory after finishing
second in the primary, saying Ryan had many questions to answer if he
expected GOP support in November.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Federal aviation officials are investigating whether federal agents
violated security rules at the Salt Lake International Airport during the
Olympics, an official said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The internal probe was prompted by a complaint from at least one agent
stationed in Salt Lake City who said lax security created risks for
travelers, said Rebecca Trexler, a Transportation Security Administration
spokeswoman in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged lapses included the failure to re-screen passengers when a
metal detector was found unplugged Feb. 16; checkpoint screeners allowing
other screeners to walk around detectors; and inadequate screenings and
searches of passengers.</LD>
<TE>   The agency took over aviation security Feb. 17 as the Olympics were
well underway.</TE>

<LD>Homeland security director Tom Ridge met with several senators on
Capitol Hill in an attempt to explain why he believes that, as a personal
advisor to President Bush, he has no obligation to formally testify
before Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The White House says Ridge should be treated like National Security
Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who traditionally is immune from congressional
testimony. That duty normally falls to Cabinet secretaries.</LD>
<LD>   While not available for comment after the meeting, Sen. Robert C. Byrd
(D-W.Va.) said last week that the pace of Congress' work on next year's
defense bill might depend on what Ridge has to say about Bush's domestic
security spending request.</LD>

<HD>U.S. Will Interview More Foreigners in Fight on Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Policy: The Justice Dept. will question 3,000 visitors on a
voluntary basis to get information about attacks. Critics cite issue of
ethnic profiling.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. law enforcement officials will pursue voluntary interviews
with an additional 3,000 foreign nationals in this country in an effort
to gain more information about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   An initial round of interviews, begun in November, has elicited few
clues about the attacks, but has provided leads that might prove helpful
in the future, the Justice Department said in a report released
Wednesday. Civil libertarians have assailed the program as unfairly
targeting Muslims and Arabs while yielding little payoff for
investigators, and they were quick to denounce plans to extend it.</LD>
<LD>   But the announcement indicated that the Justice Department--far from
being deterred by the controversy over the first interviews--is
determined to continue such sweeping tactics.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe that these individuals might, either wittingly or
unwittingly, be in the same circles, communities or social groups as
those engaged in terrorist activities," Ashcroft said during a briefing
at the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Those sought for questioning, he added, are not suspected of crimes.
"We are merely seeking to solicit their assistance to obtain any
information they may have regarding possible terrorists or potential
terrorist acts," Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   In November, investigators announced plans to interview young men who
came to the United States after Jan. 1, 2000, from nations where the Al
Qaeda terrorist network is active. They eventually reached 2,261 out of a
list of almost 5,000 drawn from various government databases. The newer
list, which may take investigators 60 days to work through, will focus on
men who entered the United States more recently than those sought in the
first round.</TE>
<TE>   "While most of the interviewees had no information relating to
specific terrorists or terrorist acts," some provided leads that may help
investigators, the report found.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, which offered only sketchy details, the
interviews yielded the name and address of one person who possibly had
ties to one of the Sept. 11 hijackers, another who "recalled seeing" one
of the hijackers and the names of others who may be linked to extremist
groups. At least two interviewees identified acquaintances who had taken
flight training.</TE>
<TE>   Under the program, the Justice Department last fall drew up a list of
4,793 men, aged 18 to 33, who entered the United States on non-immigrant
visas. Of those, about 680 apparently have left the country, the location
of more than 1,000 could not be determined, and 785 were believed to have
relocated inside the United States but in many cases have yet to be
found. The vast majority of those contacted agreed to be interviewed,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite widespread fears among immigrant advocates, the meetings so
far have led to only a small number of arrests. Fewer than 20 individuals
were taken into custody, most for immigration violations, the Justice
Department said. Three were arrested on criminal charges. None of the
cases appeared to be terrorist-related.</TE>
<TE>   While officials are continuing to look for many of the men they could
not locate in the first round, Ashcroft said, "We don't assume that
because we couldn't find a person . . . they're planning a terrorist
attack."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the government program complained that it subjects
individuals who may have violated immigration laws--but are innocent of
terrorism--to deportation. While participation in the interviews is
voluntary, those sought for questioning may fear that silence could be
construed as guilt, fairly or otherwise, their advocates contend.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that if someone refuses [to talk], they're stuck with
a complete unknown about what their future will be in this country," said
David Leopold, an immigration lawyer who has attended voluntary
interviews in Detroit and Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Butterfield, director of the American Immigration Lawyers Assn.
in Washington, argued that the interview effort cannot succeed unless
those being asked to come forward are granted immunity from routine
immigration violations.</TE>
<TE>   "Until and unless such assurances are given, I don't think this
process is productive, and I don't think it's engendering confidence from
the communities he [Ashcroft] needs cooperation from," Butterfield said.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim groups Wednesday criticized the Justice Department's plan as
ethnic and racial profiling, but some also urged their members to provide
law enforcement agencies with any useful information they may have.</TE>
<TE>   "American Muslims, like all Americans, condemn terrorism in all its
forms and seek to ensure the safety of our nation against acts of
violence," said Omar Ahmad, chairman of the Council on American-Islamic
Relations, a Washington-based Islamic advocacy group. "We believe,
however, that rounding up the 'usual suspects' based on nothing more than
race, religion or national origin is not an effective law enforcement
technique and creates the perception of profiling."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad encouraged anyone with information of value to investigators to
come forward, rather than wait to be contacted for an interview.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>At a time when a polarized Congress has deadlocked over an array of
issues, it has now accomplished what many thought impossible: voting to
change the campaign finance rules that helped each of its members get
elected.</LD>
<LD>   Final passage Wednesday of the first significant campaign reform bill
in a generation resulted from a confluence of forces over the last 10
years that made it increasingly difficult for politicians to defend the
status quo--and increasingly attractive for them to accept an overhaul.</LD>
<LD>   Recurring scandals capped by the collapse of the Enron Corp. eroded
political support for the current campaign finance system--even by
President Bush, one of its most skilled practitioners.</LD>
<TE>   But the reformers' road to victory also was paved with compromises
that made the measure an easier pill for other lawmakers to swallow.
Reformers jettisoned their most far-reaching aims, such as public
financing of campaigns. And the final bill included provisions that give
incumbents new advantages over challengers.</TE>
<TE>No Clear Advantage for Either Side</TE>
<TE>   Another key to the bill's passage after years of effort by its backers
is that it remains unclear which party will benefit the most. If either
party clearly stood to gain a decisive advantage, it probably would not
have passed.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone tells you they know how this plays out, they don't know
what they are talking about," said Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio).</TE>
<TE>   The bill's proponents see its passage as a triumph of grass-roots
political pressure over the resistance of power brokers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a vindication of the view that when the public really wants
something, it will happen," said Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   But the bill's critics say it is a triumph of a media elite obsessed
with the issue, while other Americans care little.</TE>
<TE>   "Editorial boards around the country fanned the flames for over a
decade," said Ed Gillespie, a lobbyist and former campaign advisor to
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Like it or loathe it, the campaign finance bill is a major
accomplishment for a Congress that has been prone to gridlock. Energy
legislation is in danger of dying in the Senate--or emerging stripped of
its major initiatives. It took lawmakers six months to pass a three-month
extension of unemployment benefits, usually a routine measure during a
recession. The House and Senate are at loggerheads over this year's
budget, and Bush's hopes of passing additional tax cuts are essentially
dead on arrival.</TE>
<TE>   The current campaign finance bill passed where others failed in part
because it is far more limited in scope. Bills in the early 1990s called
for voluntary spending limits for congressional campaigns, limits on
political action committees and a ban on unlimited campaign contributions
to political parties known as soft money. The bill that cleared Congress
does little more than prohibit soft money--a shrewd retreat, said Sen.
Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the bill's most vocal foe, because it forced
reform critics to defend the most problematic part of the campaign
system.</TE>
<TE>   The bill has been propelled by a stream of political scandals that
ensnared large contributors, from the savings and loan scandal of the
late 1980s to the revelations about President Clinton's fund-raising
techniques in his 1996 reelection campaign to the current controversy
over the political influence of Enron.</TE>
<TE>In 2000 Election, Voters Took Notice</TE>
<TE>   Although voters have often seemed indifferent to the issue, the 2000
election suggested otherwise. Several Senate Democrats who defeated
incumbent Republicans credited their victories, in part, to their support
for campaign reform. The potential of the issue was personified by the
surprisingly strong showing of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in his fight
against Bush for the 2000 GOP nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most striking sign of how the political calculus has
shifted in favor of reform is Bush's decision to sign a bill that he
called "unilateral disarmament" in the 2000 campaign. The absence of
opposition from Bush, McConnell said, was crucial to the bill's success.</TE>
<TE>   The irony that Bush will be the one to sign McCain's bill was not lost
on Marshall Wittmann, an analyst at the Hudson Institute who supported
McCain's presidential bid.</TE>
<TE>   "Deep down, what is most striking is that we reach the end of the road
and a Republican president is going to sign it," Wittmann said.</TE>
<TE>   One possible reason, he added, is that many Republicans "understand
that they have an Achilles' heel: their relationship with big money."</TE>
<TE>   It is also striking that Congress would pass the bill despite the
uncertainty about how it will affect the balance of power between the
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Many Republicans believe the new law would play to their party's
fund-raising strengths. But the GOP has led the charge against it, with
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) warning earlier this year that
its enactment would cost his party control of the House.</TE>
<TE>   Hastert's concerns notwithstanding, most analysts assume that the GOP
will benefit from the new system because it puts a higher premium on
"hard money"--in which a donor's contributions are limited to $1,000 per
candidate (a limit that the bill would raise to $2,000).</TE>
<TE>   The GOP raised nearly twice as much hard money as Democrats did in
each of the last five elections, including 2000, when Republicans raised
$466 million to Democrats' $275 million.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Democrats drew even with the GOP in soft money, raising
$243 million in the 2000 cycle compared with $244 million for the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their hard-money advantage, many Republicans worry that soft
money is crucial to their ability to counter the help Democrats will
continue to get from labor unions, especially for get-out-the-vote and
other efforts right before election days.</TE>
<TE>Incumbents Gain More Advantages</TE>
<TE>   White House and Republican Party officials already are discussing how
the GOP should operate under the rules. One option being explored, said a
Republican lobbyist close to the White House, is whether the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce could become more of a grass-roots organization to offset
union political activity.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how the bill affects the two parties, the measure
appears likely to give incumbents new advantages over challengers. The
soft money ban, for instance, would make it harder for political parties
to recruit and fund challengers, who often depend on party support to get
their campaigns off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always been an incumbent protection bill," said Sen. Robert F.
Bennett (R-Utah), who voted against the measure. "It makes it more
difficult for a party to recruit an attractive challenger."</TE>
<TE>   The bill's increase in hard money donations also would tend to benefit
incumbents, because they generally find it easier to raise larger amounts
from contributors than do lesser-known challengers.</TE>
<TE>   The measure also would give incumbents more latitude to fend off
millionaire challengers by allowing the donation limit to be raised if
they face a wealthy opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) is just one of many incumbents up for
reelection in 2004, the first major campaign when the rules in the bill
would apply. She is breathing a sigh of relief that she does not have to
worry so much about last-minute attack ads, often financed with soft
money.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a big, big plus," Boxer said. "I feel personally grateful."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Ronald Brownstein contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Wrecking Ball to Launch Big Philadelphia Face Lift</HD>
<DH>Renewal: Ambitious campaign will demolish thousands of abandoned
buildings to reverse 40 years of decline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>This city of row houses and rusting factories is about to embark on
one of the most ambitious urban renewal projects in the United States
since the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next five years, Philadelphia plans to spend $295 million to
tear down 14,000 abandoned homes, renovate 2,500 buildings and clear
31,000 vacant lots. The wrecking ball is expected to begin swinging this
spring.</LD>
<LD>   Once picked clean, the plots will be turned over to developers, whom
officials hope to lure with tax breaks and promises of unprecedented city
cooperation.</LD>
<TE>   With the program, Mayor John F. Street hopes to deliver on a
decades-old promise to take urban renewal out of downtown areas
frequented by commuters and tourists and bring it to the city's
downtrodden neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "This will affect the entire city footprint," said Street's spokesman,
Frank Keel. "Every section of this city will realize the benefits of this
program."</TE>
<TE>   City officials acknowledge that their investment is a gamble simply
because the blight problem is vast. In a companion program over the last
two years, the city has cleared 18,000 empty lots, hauled away 11,000
tons of debris and towed 100,000 abandoned cars, and yet Street declared
last week, "We have only just begun."</TE>
<TE>   Every corner of the city bears the scars of 40 years of population
flight and job loss. More than 500,000 people--a quarter of the city's
peak population of 2 million--have fled since 1960.</TE>
<TE>   In some neighborhoods, empty buildings stretch for blocks. Even in
Center City--the downtown area that is home to the Liberty Bell and
Independence Hall, as well as thriving restaurants--sit near-vacant and
decaying townhouses.</TE>
<TE>   A city inspection survey two years ago issued this bleak tally:
Philadelphia was pockmarked with 30,730 vacant lots and 25,922 vacant
buildings. In December, the city declared 7,371 of those vacant buildings
dangerous, either because they were falling down or had been taken over
by squatters and drug dealers. Many of the buildings are in largely
impoverished North and West Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "I lived in North Philly for years. I lived in West Philly and it is
an abomination to see what has happened to these places," said the Rev.
Kermit Newkirk, pastor at the Harold O. Davis Memorial Baptist Church.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these were wonderful neighborhoods, strong neighborhoods,
working-class neighborhoods. But those who have found a way to escape
have escaped, and those that remain have little hope that things will
change."</TE>
<TE>   Newkirk himself moved seven years ago to suburban West Chester, an
hour's drive from his parish in the city's Logan section, where residents
have evacuated hundreds of homes that began sinking in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to stay in the city," he said, "but we couldn't find
anything approaching decent, so we got out."</TE>
<TE>   The city is billing the program as strikingly different from the urban
renewal projects of the 1960s and '70s, when planners favored leveling
entire neighborhoods, evicting thousands of poor tenants and starting
fresh, usually with high-rise apartments.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, officials hope most of the demolitions will be aimed
strategically at eliminating blighted buildings while leaving
neighborhoods intact.</TE>
<TE>   Street tried to hammer home that strategy when he signed the
anti-blight measure last week on a run-down street near the University of
Pennsylvania. Penn--long considered an oasis in West
Philadelphia--invested millions in surrounding neighborhoods in the
1990s, spurring gentrification.</TE>
<TE>   What has yet to be seen is whether the cleanup will finally get
developers interested in neighborhoods that have long been seen as beyond
repair.</TE>

<DL>MINEOLA, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>A man accused of fatally shooting a priest and a parishioner during
morning Mass had been twice admitted to psychiatric hospitals, a health
official said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Troy, 34, was last discharged from the Nassau University Medical
Center by a judge's order in May 2001 and health officials lost track of
him, said Howard Sovronsky, head of the Nassau County Department of
Mental Health.</LD>
<LD>   A month earlier, police picked up Troy at a train station for behaving
irrationally and brought him to New York's Bellevue Hospital. Bellevue
officials believed he was potentially dangerous, but Troy won a legal
battle to discharge himself as mental health officials tried to evaluate
him, Sovronsky said.</LD>
<TE>   "We did make attempts to locate and find him, but those failed,"
Sovronsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Troy's case file was closed in September. Six months later, a
rifle-toting man walked into Our Lady of Peace Church on New York's Long
Island and killed Father Lawrence Penzes, 50, and parishioner Eileen
Tosner, 73.</TE>
<TE>   Troy was charged with two counts of second-degree murder and attempted
murder involving an arresting officer.</TE>

<HD>Age Bias as a Civil Rights Issue Argued in Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court confronted the job security fears of America's
graying workers on Wednesday in a case that asks whether older employees
have the same legal clout as minorities in discrimination claims.</LD>
<LD>   The justices, who have lifetime appointments, are being urged by
companies to make age bias suits tougher to prove. If the court does so,
employers would have more leeway in cutting jobs.</LD>
<LD>   The case turns on whether a 1967 law that bars on-the-job age bias
allows lawsuits on grounds that an employer's action had a
disproportionate impact on older workers. Justices have already ruled
that impact suits are allowed under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans
discrimination based on a worker's gender, religion or race.</LD>
<TE>   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the country had a long history of
racial discrimination when the court made that decision 30 years ago. She
questioned whether there was similar evidence of bias against the
elderly.</TE>
<TE>   "There are subtle biases" against older workers, said John G.
Crabtree, the attorney for the nearly 120 former Florida utility workers
in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act covers about 70 million
workers age 40 or older, nearly half the work force. Under the law, older
workers may not be treated differently because of age.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted Congress deliberately copied wording
from the 1964 act in crafting the law to protect older Americans. She
said it would be "unseemly" to interpret the identical words differently.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless we were wrong the first time," Justice Antonin Scalia said.</TE>
<TE>   Worried about lawsuits, some companies use quotas in reducing their
staffs to ensure a mix of younger and older employees, lawyer Glen D.
Nager told justices.</TE>
<TE>   Nager, representing the employer in the case, said Congress only
intended for companies to be judged by their motives and that the two
laws are different.</TE>
<TE>   The former Florida Power Corp. employees claim they were fired as part
of a company effort to change its image and reduce salary and pension
costs. More than 70% of those laid off during company reorganizations in
the 1990s were 40 or older.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said the workers could not
pursue their lawsuit under the age discrimination act.</TE>
<TE>   Some other courts have allowed age bias cases based on the "disparate
impact" standard, that an employer's action mostly affected the elderly.
Without that option, workers must prove discriminatory intent, which is
considered more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The case is Adams vs. Florida Power Corp., 01-584.</TE>

<HD>Sex and Violence on TV: It's on the Decline, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Media: Drop-off came as Hollywood felt political pressure to do
more to shield children from violent, vulgar content.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An analysis of television content shows steep declines in the
portrayals of sex and violence on the small screen over the last couple
of years, surprising the media watchdog group that conducted it.</LD>
<LD>   The Center for Media and Public Affairs, a Washington-based
nonpartisan group, found that sexual material fell by 29% and serious
violence by 17% from the 1998-99 TV season to the 2000-01 cycle.</LD>
<LD>   "There are multiple indicators that television is cleaning up its
act," the center's president, S. Robert Lichter, said. "You can't know
the future, but this is the first bit of good news in a while, the first
inkling. Whether it's invisible ink that will disappear, we'll wait to
see."</LD>
<TE>   The report, obtained Wednesday by The Times, is scheduled to be
released today at a news conference in Washington. The group first
analyzed the content of television programs and feature movies in 1998
and 1999 to establish a baseline for violent and sexual material. The
most recent findings have attracted the attention of some of Capitol
Hill's most forceful critics of Hollywood, Sens. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.)
and Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.).</TE>
<TE>   Brownback is expected to attend today's news conference, but a
scheduling conflict will keep Lieberman away. Dan Gerstein, Lieberman's
spokesman, said Wednesday that his boss was encouraged by the findings.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows not only that culture is improving in some ways, but that
parents and advocates can have an effect and bring about real changes,"
Gerstein said. "But we still have a long way to go."</TE>
<TE>   The drop in material deemed "objectionable" by critics came during a
span of intense political pressure on Hollywood to do more to shield
children from violent and vulgar material. Still, the study points out
that a similar analysis of feature films shows virtually no change.</TE>
<TE>   Network executives said they doubted that political pressure had
brought about the reductions or played a direct role in programming
decisions. They conceded that there has been heightened sensitivity to
issues of taste since lawmakers acted to give parents more information
about programs and the ability to block questionable shows.</TE>
<TE>   The study attributes the decline to shows with high levels of sex or
violence going off the air and to thematic changes in popular programs.
NBC's blockbuster hit "Friends," for example, went from being tied for
the top slot for most sexual material to falling out of the top 10
completely.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for the more family-friendly grade?</TE>
<TE>   The show dropped a running gag about an "ugly naked guy" the
characters could see in an apartment across the street and generated less
"on-screen heat" between the Monica and Chandler characters, according to
the researchers.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, despite a 56% decrease in sexual material, still was rated the
"raunchiest" on broadcast television. The study defines sexual material
as "behavioral or verbal content" linked to "pleasurable feelings
deriving from sexual desires or instincts."</TE>
<TE>   To count incidents of violence and sex, analysts reviewed full
episodes of 284 shows, the equivalent of two weeks of fictional
programming on television, using randomly selected dates. Two episodes of
each show chosen--in broadcast, cable and syndicated venues--were viewed.</TE>
<TE>   Overall violent content declined less than sexual material. The
disappearance of a handful of programs accounted for much of the drop.
The most violent show on television in 2000-01, according to the study's
methodology, was "Xena: Warrior Princess," a syndicated fantasy program
no longer in production.</TE>
<TE>   Television executives said they continue to have concerns about the
methodology used in studies that rate content. They point out that
context is rarely considered in the analysis.</TE>
<TE>   At CBS, given the worst score among major networks for violence,
spokesman Chris Ender said a few programs have "artificially inflated"
their ranking.</TE>
<TE>   Ender said the network has felt for years that it is unfair to
consider a program such as "Walker, Texas Ranger"--the only
non-syndicated show to make the top five for violence--in the same vein
as shows that portray gratuitous violence. The long-running program is
about a lawman tracking down criminals.</TE>
<TE>   CBS, the network with the fewest sex-oriented shows, registered even
less sexual material this time. But Ender, who has not yet reviewed the
study, said it would be difficult to embrace findings that gave the
network credit for reducing sexual content based largely on "The Nanny"
going off the air.</TE>
<TE>   "We had that program on at 8 p.m. and were very comfortable with it at
that hour," he said. "It comes down to methodology again. We thought 'The
Nanny' was a family show and we think we do a pretty good job of policing
ourselves in these areas."</TE>

<HD>States Slumping, but Wyoming Is Riding High</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHEYENNE, Wyo.
</DL>
<LD>While most states are struggling because of the recession, the
Cowboy State has bucked the trend--boosting spending and even handing out
generous pay raises, all without raising taxes.</LD>
<LD>   The state's good fortune stems from a long-awaited upturn a few years
ago in the market for Wyoming's coal, natural gas and oil.</LD>
<LD>   "Wyoming is still riding the top of its crest right now," said Gov.
Jim Geringer, who recently signed legislation increasing state spending
by 17%, or $237 million, over the next two years. It includes a 20% pay
raise for lawmakers and 11% for the next governor.</LD>
<TE>   Times are relatively flush in the private sector, too. Wyoming, with a
population of 490,000, had a job growth rate of 1.9% last year even as
unemployment rose nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Wyoming is one of only four states with revenue and spending on
target, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The
others are Texas, North Dakota and West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining states are struggling to balance their budgets, and some
are considering tax increases. At least 30 have cut their budgets or are
holding the line on spending.</TE>
<TE>   Some are borrowing tobacco-settlement money. Others have delayed tax
cuts, frozen hiring, raised college tuition or laid off employees.</TE>
<TE>   Programs targeted for cuts include salmon hatcheries in Oregon, food
inspections in Alaska and minimum-security prisons in Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   "Every recession, most of the states have severe fiscal problems,"
said Scott Pattison, executive director of the National Assn. of State
Budget Officers. "But there's always a handful, for some unique reasons,
which are able to avoid that, and Wyoming is showing it's part of that
handful this time."</TE>
<TE>   The state's tax burden is low to begin with--Wyoming along with Nevada
and South Dakota are the only states with no corporate, business or
personal income tax.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Wyoming turns to taxes on the mining and drilling of oil,
natural gas and coal. Direct and indirect taxes paid by the industries
pay for about a third of state government operations.</TE>
<TE>   Wyoming sinks a share of those taxes into a $2-billion trust fund, and
interest on the fund pays for about 12% of the budget each year. Without
that, each working Wyoming resident would have to pay an extra $1,000 a
year in taxes, according to the state treasurer's office.</TE>

<HD>Legal Barriers Rein In Wild Horse Exports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RENO
</DL>
<LD>Wild horses gathered from public lands around the West will not be
exported for adoption by foreign countries any time soon, the U.S. Bureau
of Land Management says.</LD>
<LD>   "We have had interest from several nations to adopt or otherwise have
wild horses and burros in their countries," said John Fend, the BLM's
wild horse program manager in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   There are too many legal and financial hurdles to begin international
adoptions now, Fend said during a meeting here Tuesday of the agency's
Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Board.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest hurdle, he said, is the Wild Horse and Burro Act
itself, which requires the BLM to monitor and enforce care requirements
for the animals for one year after they are adopted.</TE>
<TE>   Fend said an informal opinion by the Interior Department's solicitor
general concluded that the agency--charged by Congress with protecting
and managing the animals--lacks authority to enforce the law outside the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Besides legal constraints, BLM Deputy Assistant Director Elena Daly
said there also are financial considerations.</TE>
<TE>   "Compliance checks take money . . . especially out of the country,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM's oversight has been criticized by animal rights groups and
others who say the agency has turned a blind eye while adopted horses,
seen by many as a symbol of the American West, were sent to
slaughterhouses.</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad and Tobago, the two-island nation off the coast of Venezuela
in the Caribbean, had expressed interest in adopting some animals for use
by mounted police.</TE>
<TE>   Other countries, Fend said, have inquired about using mustangs or
burros from the rural West as work animals and to improve the gene pools
of their own horse populations.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the queries have come from developing nations, Fend said.</TE>
<TE>   Fend said the obstacles could be overcome through international
treaties, but added it would be up to foreign countries to initiate those
efforts with the State Department.</TE>

<HD>Study Alleges Bias in Medical Services for Minorities</HD>
<DH>Health: Institute finds lower quality of care for nonwhite
patients, regardless of income.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Racial and ethnic minorities tend to receive lower-quality health
care than whites, irrespective of income, age or insurance status,
according to a new report by the National Academies' Institute of
Medicine.</LD>
<LD>   Disparities are particularly evident in the treatment of chronic
illnesses. Minorities are less likely to undergo sophisticated treatments
such as bypass surgeries, kidney dialysis or organ transplants. They have
less access to appropriate cardiac and HIV medications and are more
likely to suffer lower-limb amputations as a result of diabetes, the
congressionally commissioned study being released today found.</LD>
<LD>   "Without question, this is overwhelming evidence of health care
disparities across the country," said Joseph Betancourt, a lead
researcher on the project who is a senior scientist at the Institute for
Health Policy in Massachusetts General Hospital-Harvard Medical School.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers reviewed nearly 600 other studies, conducted focus-group
interviews with patients and health care providers, and recorded
testimony from minority groups around the country. Although previous
research has accounted for variables such as income and insurance, the
researchers say this is the first to so comprehensively include those as
well as race, age and other factors, according to Betancourt.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at everything that happens once the patient gets into the
system," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The study says that bias and stereotyping on the part of health care
providers may contribute to differences in care, said Dr. Alan R. Nelson,
former president of the American Medical Assn. and chairman of the
research committee. For instance, the study showed that Latino patients
in Los Angeles received less pain medication, which could be attributed
to the myth that Latinos can endure more pain.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence to justify that stereotype," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said medical professionals should be better educated about
cultural differences and become more ethnically diverse. Hospitals should
hire more language interpreters to help ease what he considers to be a
"crisis" in disparity of care for non-English speakers.</TE>
<TE>   The study showed an improvement in patients' participation and
satisfaction when the health care provider is of the same ethnic group.
It also found that minority patients refuse recommended treatments more
often than whites do, but the committee noted that the doctor or nurse
should shoulder more responsibility for seeing that treatments are
accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Betancourt said he hopes the results of the study help "raise
awareness among patients that disparity exists and encourage them to get
more information about how to navigate the health care system."</TE>
<TE>   The researchers suggested the federal government should boost
resources of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of
Civil Rights to enforces laws that prohibit discrimination in health
care. "These disparities are costing the health care system now.
Initially it might cost us money, but it may save us money in the long
run," Betancourt said.</TE>

<DL>OLIVE HILL, Ky.
</DL>
<LD>Another round of rain hit the hills of Appalachia on Wednesday,
pushing flooding north into more towns as even some of the tiniest creeks
and streams turned into torrents.</LD>
<LD>   Kentucky and West Virginia got the brunt of the latest storms.</LD>
<LD>   A steady pounding in this northeastern Kentucky town produced 4 inches
of rainfall by early Wednesday, sending the usually placid Tygart Creek
over its banks.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities began evacuating residents from homes by daybreak. An
entire housing complex for the elderly had to be emptied when murky water
rose. A nearby day-care center was also evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   "The water came up so fast," said Karen Epling, assistant director of
ABC Child Care. "We had 14 children. We loaded up on the bus and got out
of here."</TE>
<TE>   Up to 70% of the homes and businesses in downtown Olive Hill were
damaged and flooding hit the fire station, which was built above the
100-year flood plain.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess that means this was a 100-year flood," said Fire Chief Rod
Stephens.</TE>
<TE>   Rain had stopped in much of the region by late Wednesday afternoon,
leaving a toll since the weekend of seven deaths and hundreds of damaged
or destroyed homes. Authorities in southwestern Virginia suspended the
search for a 75-year-old woman who was believed to have been swept away
by flood waters Monday.</TE>
<TE>   As much as 6 inches fell since Tuesday along the Ohio River border
between West Virginia and Ohio. Residents of 30 homes in Lawrence County,
Ohio, were evacuated Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   National Guard troops were helping people evacuate in parts of
Kentucky, where Gov. Paul E. Patton declared emergencies in 12 counties
and asked for federal help.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner made a similar disaster assistance
request for southwestern Virginia after weekend rains caused severe
flooding that swept away bridges and temporarily displaced more than
1,000 people.</TE>

<HD>Daschle Says He's Unable to Stop Yucca Mountain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>Nevada's most powerful congressional ally in the fight to stop a
federal nuclear waste dump near Las Vegas on Wednesday backed off his
pledge to kill the project in the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said he is powerless under
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to block a vote on the Yucca
Mountain project.</LD>
<LD>   "I was not aware that this legislation, when we drafted it decades
ago, is under an expedited procedure," Daschle said at a news conference
in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   Daschle referred to his declaration May 30, 2001, in Las Vegas that he
and Harry Reid of Nevada, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate,
would kill the Yucca Mountain plan if it reached the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we're in the majority, it's dead," Daschle said at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," the ranking Democrat in the Senate said Wednesday, "the
expedited procedure precludes me from keeping it from coming to the
floor."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) insisted Wednesday that Daschle has the
power to use his majority party power to quash Yucca Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom Daschle made a very clear statement that Yucca is dead as long as
he's the majority leader," Ensign said during a conference call from
Washington. "If Tom Daschle keeps his word, the state of Nevada will not
have nuclear waste. All he has to do is not allow that veto override to
come to the floor."</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle and Reid say Nevada will lose the last legislative battle
in the Yucca Mountain fight unless Ensign marshals enough GOP votes to
augment the thin Democratic majority in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   If Daschle can't use a parliamentary maneuver to stop it, the crucial
decision will be a majority Senate vote on whether to uphold Nevada Gov.
Kenny Guinn's promised veto of President Bush's approval for the Yucca
Mountain project.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a final vote," Ensign said. "I agree that I need to work my rear
end off to get more votes."</TE>
<TE>   Bush approved the site Feb. 15. Guinn has until April 16 to exercise
his veto, and Congress will have 90 days to vote on the Yucca Mountain
plan. Nevada lawmakers concede they do not have enough support in the
House to stop the project.</TE>
<TE>   Ensign would not say how many votes he can muster. The lawmaker said
two Republicans who have sided with him in the past to oppose Yucca
Mountain are Sens. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado and Lincoln Chafee
of Rhode Island.</TE>
<TE>   The Energy Department plans to ship 77,000 tons of radioactive waste
from more than 100 commercial, industrial and military reactor sites to
Yucca Mountain, 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas.</TE>

<HD>GOP and Democrats Push Budgets, With a Divide on Deficits,
Surpluses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Republicans steered a $2.1-trillion budget for next year toward
House passage Wednesday that mirrors President Bush's plan of
strengthening defense and domestic security while allowing deficits to
return.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate's majority Democrats unfurled their own fiscal blueprint of
the same amount and planned to shove it through its budget panel today.
It focuses on generating surpluses without using Social Security funds by
2008, while embracing Bush's defense proposals for two years and
outspending him for schools, health and road building.</LD>
<LD>   A budget stalemate is likely this year.</LD>
<TE>   "We have led on our side," said Rep. Mark Steven Kirk (R-Ill.),
scolding House Democrats who offered no alternative budget. "We have a
plan to protect Social Security. We have a plan to prosecute the war. We
have a plan to provide tax relief for Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats criticized Republicans for a budget that would use $831
billion in Social Security surpluses over five years to pay for other
programs. They said that was thanks to the money soaked up by the
$1.35-trillion, 10-year tax cut Republicans won last year.</TE>

<LD>Randy Hoffman, who lost his bid for a county Board of Supervisors
seat two weeks ago, was appointed to the Thousand Oaks Planning
Commission along with a Harvard-educated researcher who works in the
mayor's law office.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council ousted two commissioners last month after they
sought to delay a vote on a politically tinged land-swap deal.</LD>
<LD>   Janice Osterhaven, who works in Mayor Ed Masry's legal practice,
was nominated to the commission by outgoing Councilwoman Linda Parks.
Parks won the 2nd District supervisory seat by defeating Hoffman.</LD>
<TE>   Hoffman, a millionaire businessman nominated by Councilman Dan Del
Campo, told the council that he looked forward to serving on the
commission, which reviews housing projects and other development
proposals.</TE>
<TE>   But Parks and two residents spoke against his appointment, saying
that Hoffman may be ineffective because his numerous campaign
contributions from developers ought to disqualify him from ruling on
many projects that may come before the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman said he would have "a fierce independence" on the
commission and would respect the city's tradition of carefully
managing its growth.</TE>
<TE>   Parks joined Del Campo and Councilmen Dennis Gillette and Andy Fox
in approving Hoffman on Tuesday night, and Masry abstained.
Osterhaven was approved unanimously.</TE>
