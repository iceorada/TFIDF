<LD>Sam</LD>
<LD>   The Boy Behind the Mask</LD>
<LD>   Tom Hallman Jr.</LD>
<TE>   Putnam: 224 pages, $22.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Picture Sam Lightner: an eighth-grade boy, small for his age at 5
feet and 83 pounds, getting ready to cross over from the relative
safety of middle school to the raucous hormone hell of high school.
Sam agonizes over what to wear to the open house at Portland's
largest high school, which he'll attend in the fall. "He's discarded
one shirt after another, trying for the right combination," writes
journalist Tom Hallman Jr. in his triumphant, intense and bittersweet
telling of Sam's young life. "But it doesn't matter. Sam could show
up in the latest fashion, and still, he knows, no girl will swoon
over him. Tonight, he simply wants to blend in and be like everybody
else. He knows that will be impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Once you've pictured this slight boy, add what people notice
first: Sam's face. "A huge mass of flesh balloons from the left
side," Hallman explains. "The main body of tissue, laced with blue
veins, swells in a dome from sideburn level to chin. The mass draws
his left eye into a slit, warps his mouth into a small inverted
half-moon. It looks as though someone had slapped three pounds of wet
clay onto his face, where it clings, burying the boy inside."
Hallman's extraordinary book, telling the heart-wrenching tale of
Sam's facial deformity and its impact on his life and health, grew
out of a four-part series he wrote for the (Portland) Oregonian and
for which he was awarded the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for feature writing.</TE>
<TE>   The extremely rare congenital deformity causes a number of
physical problems. Sam must breathe through a tracheostomy, a hole in
this throat that allows air to funnel directly to his lungs,
bypassing the swollen tissue that blocks the usual airway; he cannot
go swimming because he'd drown easily with the tracheostomy, and
cannot play contact sports because the weight of the deformity throws
him off balance easily.</TE>
<TE>   The physical problems seem almost trifling when compared with the
emotional pain. Sam is an extremely smart student, clever and
innovative, yet is often misjudged: Those who don't know him think
he's stupid or developmentally handicapped. Many stare open-mouthed,
others yell jeers from passing cars: "Freak!" Even faculty members at
the high school assume on first glance that Sam belongs in the
developmental program.</TE>
<TE>   The facial mass is so large and unusual that doctors knew
something was wrong even before Sam was born, but they couldn't
figure out what. After performing an ultrasound during the seventh
month of pregnancy, doctors warned that "(t)he baby's brain is
floating outside the head" and predicted the child would die. At
birth, his parents learned there was nothing wrong with Sam's brain;
it was his face that was the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, doctors thought the mass could simply be removed. Just
after Sam's birth, one doctor covered the deformity with a cloth.
"This is what he will look like after surgery." But that assessment
was wrong. A pediatric surgeon was able to remove part of the mass in
order to ease Sam's breathing, but too many nerves and blood vessels
ran through the mass for it to simply be cut off. Several years
later, Sam underwent another surgery, in the hopes of reducing the
disfigurement, but he bled heavily from the first incision and the
attempt had to be abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Hallman adroitly delineates the background of Sam's life, leading
up to the boy's choice as a high school freshman -- with his family's
blessing -- to gamble with his life and try surgery again. Sam's case
is taken on by an elite team of surgeons at Boston's Children's
Hospital, the only surgeons in the nation willing to grapple with the
complexities of his unusual case, and undergoes a grueling 13-hour
surgery. He nearly dies in the process but survives, only to find
months later, when he's back in Portland, that the surgery has had
the unintended effect of altering the blood flow to and from his
brain.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, fluid builds around Sam's brain until he slips into a
coma. Readers follow along as doctors fight over what to do and his
parents agonize. Days drag on with little or no response from Sam.
Will he come out of it? Should he be left to die? His family and one
pediatric neurosurgeon, Monica Wehby, fight for Sam, believing he'll
recover. With only intuition and faith guiding her, she must tolerate
the gibes of colleagues for her belief that Sam will emerge from the
coma. Hallman is marvelous as a journalist-storyteller, imbuing Sam's
tale with an insightful, human and compassionate timbre. He takes
readers inside Sam's experience and his parents' difficulties while
subtly raising questions about our society: Why are we so set on
judging each other by looks? What kind of future awaits Sam with his
generous heart and incisive mind hidden behind a deformed face? What
possibilities exist when science and faith intersect?</TE>
<TE>   The true story of a boy with more courage than should be required
of anyone, "Sam" is a heartbreaking tale with no easy answers, a
story that earns every tear it wrings.</TE>

Nicholson motor-home trip's $601,711 for the weekend brought its
10-day total to just over $1 million.</LD>
<LD>   "Adaptation" widened by 102 theaters to 109, averaging $10,165 per
site, giving the Sony release a weekend total of $1.1 million and
$2.1 million to date.</LD>
<LD>   Spike Lee's "25th Hour" clocked an impressive $21,773 per theater
over the weekend in five theaters, two in L.A. and three in New York.
Since the Disney/Touchstone release opened Thursday, it has grossed
$130,833.</LD>
<TE>   Also opening on Thursday, Fox Searchlight's "Antwone Fisher"

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Sir Paul McCartney has been granted his own coat of arms, which pays
homage to the former Beatle's musical career and his hometown of
Liverpool, a newspaper reports.</LD>
<LD>   According to the Sunday Times, the crest features a liver -- a
fanciful bird that appears on Liverpool's arms -- holding a guitar in
its claw. Four curved emblems resembling beetles' backs reflect his
career with John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.</LD>
<LD>   The motto is "Ecce Cor Meum," Latin for "Behold My Heart," which
is the title of an oratorio he composed.</LD>
<TE>   The Sunday Times said McCartney applied for the crest in 1997, the
year he was knighted for his contribution to British music and
society, but the death of his first wife, Linda, in 1998 delayed its
design and approval. The coat of arms was granted by the College of
Arms, the English heraldic body formed in 1484, the newspaper said.</TE>

<HD>The 45s get to listen to their 33s</HD>
<DH>With portable players growing in popularity, the old vinyl
records come out of the closet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Eastman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Record players, those churning fossils buried by cassette tapes and
compact discs decades ago, are back making noise.</LD>
<LD>   Step into most department, discount and furnishing stores and
you'll see brand new portable "suitcase" versions selling for a
C-note or two. They don't pump out the listening quality of a
turntable tied to a sophisticated audio system, but they do play LPs
and singles evenly.</LD>
<LD>   And, more important to those who paid half a buck for "I Want to
Hold Your Hand" to spin at a patio dance party in 1964, they deliver
sound waves of nostalgia.</LD>
<TE>   The portables are part of a long tradition of record playing that
dates to the 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   In the '50s, teenagers who were tired of waiting for Mom and Dad's
78s to play out on the family hi-fi laid down a few bucks to get
their own lightweight record players-to-go.</TE>
<TE>   The early versions were designed for 45s, but by the '60s the
portables could also handle the long-playing 33s.</TE>
<TE>   As hot as records were for most of the 20th century, they were
consigned to boxes in the garage or closet after compact discs
crashed the scene in 1983. But the love of vinyl never went cold. For
auditory purists, a record's rich sound is sweeter than a lover's
whisper. And the technology was simpler -- a skip could be overcome
by an eraser strategically placed on the tone arm.</TE>
<TE>   "When you got a new record and played it, it sounded great," says
Kenny "Hi-fi" Bowers of the Needle Doctor, a mail-order company that
sells turntables. "And it still sounds great."</TE>
<TE>   When CDs were outpacing vinyl three to one in the mid-'80s, most
people got rid of their record players, but many held tightly to
their LPs and singles.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, platter-philes have hunted for copies of old records,
particularly material unlikely ever to be converted to the new
format. As a nod to the enduring lure of vinyl, some new music is
also released in record form.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, retailers tested the market for a return to record
players by offering them as a gift item around holidays. The Consumer
Electronics Assn. said 177,000 non-DJ turntables sold out quickly,
and this season retailers are turning up the volume.</TE>
<TE>   What merchants realized, says Katherine Borgfeldt of Sharper
Image, is that many people have stacks of records and no way to play
them. This month, the company added a portable record player-CD-radio
combo to its lineup. "We have sophisticated entertainment centers in
our living rooms, but we still need some way to enjoy our albums on
the patio or at a vacation home," says Borgfeldt.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Chavez of Laguna Hills has 1,100 vinyl records, even
though at 27 he is too young to have known the joys of hearing a 45
on a low-tech player. Still, he sees the beauty of an inexpensive
portable.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be fun to play a record outside," says the sometimes DJ,
who has in his bedroom a Panasonic Technics SL-1200 turntable for
which the phono cartridge alone cost $120. Another benefit to a
portable: He can take it with him when he's digging through crates of
used records at vintage stores.</TE>
<TE>   Like a good single, there's a B-side to this: More retro-record
stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Restoration Hardware, which introduced a 1960s-style player last
year that became its bestselling item, now has a mini record store
within its stores selling accessories. There's an LP carrying case in
padded leatherette to match the record player, wire-rack holders to
prop up albums, static-kicking cleaning kits and even new re-releases
on red vinyl. Elvis, of course.</TE>

<HD>Rudeness wins all the marbles</HD>

<LD>Last month, Darren Statt, a talent agent at Endeavor, showed up at
the DreamWorks lot to meet with the studio's top production
executives. When he discovered the execs weren't around, the Scottish
agent launched into an obscenity-filled tirade directed at a
production executive's assistant.</LD>
<LD>   "It was so ugly that someone went around closing all the
assistants' doors. You could hear this guy in every corner of the
building," recalls DreamWorks marketing chief Terry Press. Statt
apologized afterward and sent flowers to the assistant. But when
Steven Spielberg heard of the incident, the studio called Endeavor to
lodge a formal complaint. Statt, who declined to discuss the
incident, worked at home for two weeks before leaving Endeavor for
good earlier this month. But in Hollywood, bad behavior is rarely
punished. Within days, rival agency UTA had snatched up Statt and his
star client, the Rock, one of the industry's hottest action heroes.</LD>
<LD>   "Personally, I think most of the people at Endeavor could use a
three-week sojourn to charm school," says Press. "But this is
Hollywood, the only business in the world where people seem to
confuse rudeness with power. People think that being rude and
demeaning is somehow a show of importance when, to me, it just
suggests that you're dealing with a lot of spoiled brats whose
mommies didn't give them enough time-outs."</LD>
<TE>   Getting into the Christmas spirit, the industry has been buzzing
-- perhaps chortling would be a better word -- over Ken Auletta's
barbed New Yorker profile of Miramax czar Harvey Weinstein. The piece
that ran in the Dec. 16 issue was highlighted by accounts of
Weinstein's nasty showdowns with producer Scott Rudin, Universal
Chairman Stacey Snider, filmmaker Julie Taymor (who made "Frida" for
Miramax) and volcanic-tempered Vivendi Universal chief Barry Diller,
who called Weinstein "a bully," which is sort of like Trent Lott
attacking David Duke for being a bigot.</TE>
<TE>   Of course in Hollywood, a town so competitive that people
routinely root for friends to fail, many players thought Weinstein
got off easy. Several executives I spoke to last week dismissed the
profile as "a puff piece." Translation: The Miramax boss is even a
worse ogre than portrayed in the story. Only a death sentence would
fit his crimes. In fact, the "hip" Hollywood insult of the moment is
for someone, just before slamming down the phone in a fit of rage, to
bellow, "You should die!"</TE>
<TE>   The trash talk may have changed, but the sentiments are older than
talking pictures. Bad behavior is permanently embedded in showbiz
DNA. Since its wild 'n' woolly early years, Hollywood has been a
briar patch of feuding moguls, narcissistic movie stars and
egomaniacal directors. In the old days, it was not uncommon to see
disputes settled by bare-knuckled fisticuffs. Errol Flynn and John
Huston once got into a drunken brawl at David O. Selznick's house
that sent both to the hospital, Flynn with two broken ribs, Huston
with a broken nose. When Flynn called to inquire about Huston's
health, the director said he'd "thoroughly enjoyed the fight and
hoped we'd do it again sometime."</TE>
<TE>   Today's antics, however, are more Scrooge than Marquess of
Queensberry: The miscreants kowtow to the powerful and let fly at
their inferiors. Rudin's tantrums with agents are the stuff of
legend; many people believe a Rudin showdown with Endeavor's
imperious Ari Emanuel would draw a bigger crowd than a
Tyson-Holyfield fight. But the hot-tempered producer dotes on his
favored writers and actors; he throws potted plants only at his lowly
assistants. When Viacom Entertainment Chairman Jonathan Dolgen was an
exec at 20th Century Fox, assistants were forbidden to say hello to
him in the hallways, since a cheery "Good morning, Mr. Dolgen!" might
disrupt the great man's train of thought.</TE>
<TE>   Bad behavior, of course, isn't unique to show business; it's
simply more virulent and out in the open. Decorum is more prized in
professions that have some semblance of workplace behavior
protection, in the form of either union regulation or collegial
tradition. Even sports, a haven for hot heads of all sorts, promptly
penalizes egregious outbursts by tossing people out of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone has a pet theory about why Hollywood is such a hotbed of
boorishness. One explanation: Showbiz is teeming with unhappy,
insecure people with a lethal combination of big egos and low
self-esteem. "Show business attracts a lot of borderline narcissists
who had unhappy childhoods," says Arnold Stiefel, a film producer and
manager who handles crooner Rod Stewart. "These are the people who
were bullied in school but, now that they've become powerful, they've
become the school bully themselves."</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder people describe Hollywood as high school, except
with money. But is it money that corrupts? Or were the scariest
showbiz monsters just as devilish when they were 22-year-old
nobodies? People say Diller was equally fearsome in his youth. "When
Scott Rudin was a young executive at Fox, he'd return my phone calls
at 8 p.m.," recalls veteran manager Bernie Brillstein, who was the
first person in Hollywood to blow the whistle on ex-power agent
Michael Ovitz's noxious behavior. "Who was he kidding? So that's the
last time I dealt with him." Brillstein laughs. "It starts early. I
can guarantee you that none of these guys were the most popular
person in their high school class."</TE>
<TE>   Showbiz incivility is also bred by the industry's ferocious sense
of competition. "This is a business where, if you succeed, people
will allow you to behave badly," says Revolution Studios founder Joe
Roth. "There are no rules, other than winning."</TE>
<TE>   Outbursts of pique are also tangled up in issues of ego,
entitlement and a mind-bending detachment from reality. Michael Bay,
for one, parked his Ferrari in a handicapped space while he had a
reporter from Esquire along for the ride.</TE>
<TE>   Actors and filmmakers are coddled like newborn babes, in part
because they wield enormous power but also out of a widely held
notion that when it comes to the artistic temperament, even the worst
infantile excesses must be forgiven. Because Martin Lawrence is a
star, he can demand that his film crew never speak to him when he's
on the set. Just imagine the hush if Lawrence and Dolgen ever ended
up in the same room!</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood publicist Bumble Ward was on the phone with a prominent
director while driving her children home when the client launched
into a profane tirade, upset that she was paying more attention to
her kids than to him. "If people think you're brilliant or going to
make them a lot of money, everything is forgiven," she says. "There's
no explaining the level of humiliation people put up with in this
town. I'd love to talk to a shrink about it."</TE>
<TE>   The analysts' couches must get quite a beating in this business. I
was surprised by how many industry-ites I spoke with -- people with
reputations for being mild-mannered -- acknowledged having been in
therapy for anger management issues. "No matter how corporate
Hollywood has become, it's still a very emotional business," says
Variety editor Peter Bart, who as a production executive in the 1970s
fired a director in mid-argument.</TE>
<TE>   "You're always in situations that are unique to the movie
business, where a movie is behind schedule or running 20 minutes too
long. But the solution is purely subjective. Everything is opinion.
So you argue and people fly off the handle."</TE>
<TE>   One producer I know uses his quick temper as a motivational tool,
saying filmmakers listen only when someone starts yelling at them,
mistaking kindness for weakness. Another producer fires someone on
the first day of shooting to let the crew know who's boss.</TE>
<TE>   "People are often tough on their staff because you're so
frustrated by your lack of control of everything else in the
filmmaking process that you obsess on the few things you can
control," says Jersey Films partner Michael Shamberg. "So much of
being creative is rooted in being childlike, and in that childlike
world, a lot of people feel they don't have to exercise any
self-control."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's it. Hollywood isn't high school with money -- it's
preschool with a posse of sandbox bullies. The toddler who pitches
the biggest tantrum gets the best treats. In modern-day showbiz, no
one behaved more abominably than producer Don Simpson, who died awash
in a sea of drugs. "And the worse he behaved, the more people talked
about him. Everyone loved to tell Don Simpson stories," recalls his
friend, producer Steve Tisch. "A lot of people seemed to live
vicariously through him. But what does that say about our industry,
that we reward, even deify, that kind of behavior?"</TE>
<TE>   I'm not saying there's a moral to this story, but in Hollywood,
it's usually the bird that screams until you can see the veins in its
neck that gets the worm.</TE>

<HD>Klezmatics let out emotions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Klezmatics were one of the important ensembles fueling the
klezmer revival that began in the '70s. Since their arrival in the
mid-'80s, their music has become a defining example of the creatively
eclectic nature of American klezmer -- an artistic expression
reaching well beyond the European wedding music roots of the genre.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, the Klezmatics introduced a new concert series,
"Klezmer to Klassics: the Nimoy Concert Series," at Temple Israel of
Hollywood before a full house of hand-clapping enthusiasts. Much of
their program traced to their most recent album, "The Well," as well
as the whimsically titled mid-'90s CD, "Jews With Horns" and the
upcoming "Rise Up."</LD>
<LD>   Characteristically, the program ranged across the musical spectrum
from traditional songs to sounds resembling avant-garde jazz. But,
perhaps because of the setting, the Klezmatics chose to emphasize
older music. And many of the numbers departed from the traditional
instrumental nature of klezmer to feature ensemble vocals, often
showcasing the extraordinary, high, emotionally engaging tenor voice
of Lorin Sklamberg.</LD>
<TE>   Among the other highlights of the vocal aspects of the set was a
send-up of the Purim story that could probably only have been done by
the Klezmatics. Fascinating, as well, in a vastly different sense,
was the ensemble's intensely focused rendering of Holly Near's
anthem-like "I Ain't Afraid."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the program's instrumental passages roved far and
wide. Violinist Lisa Gutkin has extensive experience in Celtic music,
and there were many segments in which the lively rhythms of the hora
seemed to resonate with the energies of reels and jigs. At other
times, trumpeter Frank London used a Harmon mute to produce sounds
distinctly reminiscent of Miles Davis, and woodwind specialist Matt
Darriau either whipped off avant-garde saxophone riffs or added
atmospheric sounds via his Middle Eastern flute.</TE>
<TE>   The Klezmatics will be followed in the Klezmer to Klassics series
with programs featuring the Viklarbo chamber ensemble (March 23) and
the strings of the L.A. Jewish Symphony (June 8).</TE>

<HD>Designs for everyman</HD>
<DH>Pierre Lafaurie's pieces are hot with hip shoppers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valli Herman-Cohen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Paris</DL>
<LD>Paris</LD>
<LD>   At the precise moment that Pierre Lafaurie aimed his motorcycle
for the cobblestone sidewalk, hopped the ancient curb and sped around
a large stalled truck, it became clear how he could bring a sense of
adventure and spontaneity to something as elementary as a poplin
shirt.</LD>
<LD>   Moments later, a policeman at the summit of Montmartre, home of
the Sacre Coeur basilica, is asking for his driver's license, which
is duly presented with a smile and some clever banter that avoids
arrest. Curbs, laws and even national borders are no obstacle for the
emerging French men's clothing designer.</LD>
<TE>   It's that ready-for-anything spirit that has captured the
attention of an international set of shoppers from Santa Monica's
Montana Avenue to the Place des Vosges, in Paris' Marais district.</TE>
<TE>   They come to his Emile Lafaurie shops for the affordable pieces
that mix easily into dressy-casual wardrobes and that are designed to
travel as easily between countries as they do between business and
social settings. One of those frequent shoppers was Sean Cassidy --
not the teen idol, but a young former marketing director for
Scholastic Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "This one store had everything," Cassidy recalled of his
love-at-first-sight encounter with Emile Lafaurie, the fictitious
name the designer gave his store and collection. Cassidy, a frequent
Paris visitor, bought nearly all of his clothes from Lafaurie's cozy
boutique on Rue de Birague in the Marais.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I saw him, I said, 'You should open a store in New
York so I don't have to come to Paris to buy clothes,' " Cassidy
recalled while visiting Los Angeles earlier this month. Nearly 10
years after that first meeting, Cassidy and Lafaurie have become best
friends and business partners. They have opened more shops in Europe
(where they are known as Emile Lafaurie) and in the U.S., where they
are called Sean and carry the Lafaurie label exclusively. This month
the partners are celebrating the first anniversary of their Montana
Avenue Sean store, the fifth of five in the U.S. (There are three in
New York, one in San Francisco.)</TE>
<TE>   While the clothing business at large continues to suffer from
sluggish sales in the U.S. and Europe, Cassidy and Lafaurie's
collaboration upends the notion that menswear is a static field, that
independent retailers are outmoded and that French and American
fashion are fundamentally at odds.</TE>
<TE>   The partners have discovered a style common not to an age, a
nationality or a budget, but to a spirit and a need. Such utilitarian
touches as button-out linings in coats, zippers in cardigans and an
ever-evolving palette keep wardrobes fresh.</TE>
<TE>   It's telling that Cassidy, 36 and single, and Lafaurie, 37 and
married with two children, live very different lives on distant
continents, yet share the same fashion aesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   Lafaurie, whose long blond hair makes him look like a California
surfer, was an only child raised in Paris by his lamp-maker mother,
aunt and grandmother. After military service in the French navy, he
traveled the world doing odd jobs and lingered in Southern
California's sun and surf, experiences that have become lasting
inspirations.</TE>
<TE>   Cassidy, lean with a shaved head, grew up in a family of five in
Winslow, Maine, population 7,700, where he became an avid reader to
explore more exotic worlds. After earning a business degree, he
landed in New York at the children's book publisher Scholastic Inc.,
where in a span of nine years he became director of marketing. He
started going to Paris regularly to relax. His parents, who worked in
newspaper advertising, were part of a large extended family, and he
often shepherded dozens of unruly younger cousins.</TE>
<TE>   It's a skill he says helps him "manage Pierre." Measured and
steady, Cassidy is the business mind that corrals the high-flying
energy of Lafaurie. He's what Barry Schwartz is to Calvin Klein, or
Pierre Berge to Yves Saint Laurent -- the counterbalance, friend and
advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Given their differences yet similar style sensibilities, a wide
variety of shoppers also can tune in to the duo's classic but
contemporary clothing. Cassidy recalled with pride the moment when
two shoppers, one 60 and the other 28, emerged from the dressing room
in the same suit.</TE>
<TE>   The bestselling item on both continents is a boxy patch-pocket
jacket inspired by a coat worn by French painters. In cotton it's
$98; in wool, $160; and in suede it's one of the most expensive items
in the collection at $450. Paris architects have adopted the
painter's coat as a sort of uniform, while in L.A. it's collected by
creative types, including producers, writers and a string of actors
such as Alec Baldwin, Luke Wilson and Kevin Spacey.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started the company," Lafaurie explained in his slightly
fractured English, "I have a vision of the customer. I decide to make
a choice of the customer I knew well -- he is artistic and business
oriented."</TE>
<TE>   To ease fitting, suit jackets and pants are sold separately, a
concept that's foreign to most tailored menswear, American or
European. Most items are less than $110, a rarity for better European
sportswear. The clothes are made of fine Italian fabrics, designed in
France and manufactured in Portugal. And the fit, style and
distribution are attuned to the well traveled, more of whom lately
are Americans.</TE>
<TE>   New Yorker Andrew Arrick has become a typical Sean customer. While
in Paris on business earlier this year, Arrick stopped in to shop at
Emile Lafaurie. Cassidy recognized him as a regular customer in the
SoHo store.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so easy to shop here," said Arrick, who is a wholesale
account executive for the French designer line Celine, and who needs
a wardrobe that's sophisticated, comfortable and flexible.</TE>
<TE>   The collections are so carefully edited, Cassidy is fond of
saying, that "it's almost possible to walk into any store and choose
a wardrobe with your eyes closed."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-four hues of shirts are available every season, and they
coordinate with sweaters, corduroy trousers, chinos, jeans, ties and
more. To ensure that their seasonal palettes work in cities as
diverse as Paris and L.A., Cassidy and Lafaurie scour fabric swatches
together, often while sitting on Venice Beach -- which happens to be
one of Lafaurie's favorite places to in-line skate.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Lafaurie was frustrated at the difficulty of getting
around a sprawling fabric show in Paris, so he strapped on
Rollerblades to negotiate the space and, as a byproduct, became well
recognized to every manufacturer in the place.</TE>
<TE>   By doing what comes naturally, Lafaurie often finds he's a center
of attention -- a quality that seems to serve his company, which has
no advertising budget to confront the fierce fashion market.</TE>
<TE>   "The only marketing we have is street marketing," he said, "the
word of mouth. It's like the ball of snow. One man tells another."
Word seems to travel nearly as fast as Lafaurie can zip across a
cobblestone bridge over the Seine on his motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   So business is good? "Oui," Lafaurie shouts over the roar of his
engine. "Business is always good -- if you have the right product at
the right price at the right time."</TE>

<HD>A force in the world of punk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You could tell a lot about the legacy of the Clash from the reactions
Monday to the news the British punk band's Joe Strummer had died,
apparently of a heart attack, in England.</LD>
<LD>   This wasn't a rock band, like the Beatles or U2, whose music was
so accessible and inspiring that it drew everyone under its spell.
So, reports Monday of Strummer's death drew many blank expressions
from casual pop fans who only thought of the Clash as the punk band
that followed the Sex Pistols to America.</LD>
<LD>   For the generation of music fans touched by the energy and
independence of the super-charged, rebellious punk movement, however,
the Clash was an absolutely indispensable force. There weren't tears
Monday -- there was never any sentimentality in the Clash's music.
But the sense of loss was deep.</LD>
<TE>   U2's Bono was quick to express his respects.</TE>
<TE>   "The Clash was the greatest rock band," the Irishman said in a
statement Monday. "They wrote the book for U2."</TE>
<TE>   Bono tends to be generous in his praise, but there was a profound
truth in his words.</TE>
<TE>   For millions of punk-aligned rock fans, the Clash was their
Beatles. Not only did the band enrich the musical range of punk in
the late '70s and early '80s by incorporating elements of rockabilly
and reggae into its buzz-saw sound, but the Clash also expanded the
subject matter of punk to include serious reflections on politics and
social protest.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of classic albums, including 1979's "London Calling"
and 1981's "Sandinista!," the Clash expressed the frustrations and
aspirations of young people, taking the pioneering punk efforts of
the Sex Pistols and Ramones to a new level of ambition and
accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   Much like the Who, the Clash wrote about their times. Their songs
were virtual snapshots of the blue-collar British youth whose spirit
had been beaten down by social conditions. Its themes ranged from
racism and police brutality to alienation and disenfranchisement.</TE>
<TE>   Strummer was the son of a British diplomat, but he identified with
working-class youth. Sent away to boarding school, he detested "the
thick rich people's thick rich kids." He was later thrown out of art
school and ended up fending for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by the explosive defiance of the Pistols, he formed the
Clash, whose primary lineup also consisted of guitarist-vocalist Mick
Jones, bassist Paul Simonon and drummer Topper Headon.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, the Clash was a rock band that lived up to its
name. Strummer wrote most of the songs with Jones and he sang with
such a fury that he sometimes left out whole words to keep pace with
the beat. Because the Sex Pistols were seen as little more than a
joke by the record industry in the U.S., the Clash also found lots of
resistance at rock radio here.</TE>
<TE>   They eventually broke through the mainstream pop curtain in the
U.S. with a series of melodic hit singles, "Train in Vain (Stand By
Me)" and "Should I Stay or Should I Go." Rather than try to follow up
on this more accessible sound, Strummer and the Clash stuck mostly to
its more challenging and experimental style. Internal tensions
eventually led to Jones being kicked out of the band in 1983 and the
Clash was never the same. It broke up three years later.</TE>
<TE>   Punk has splintered in several directions in recent years, with
bands as diverse as the lightweight Blink 182 to the more serious
minded Fugazi all clinging proudly to the name. But the Clash remains
punk's Holy Grail.</TE>
<TE>   Listening again to the Clash, it's remarkable how much the music
seems in line with rock's idealistic tradition. The reason is
Strummer, who was 50, believed so fully in that tradition.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, Strummer loved to talk about early rock, especially
American rock. One of his personal heroes was John Fogerty, whose
hits with Creedence Clearwater Revival also reflected a blue-collar
perspective. Strummer spoke with equal enthusiasm about Bob Dylan and
the power of music to change lives.</TE>
<TE>   "At least I know music did something to my mind that was really
valuable and, I suspect, it did the same to a lot of other people,"
he told me in 1982. "Maybe it was just the fact that Dylan showed
someone could speak up and talk in his music about an alternative to
what seems to be a straight, boring road to destruction."</TE>
<TE>   For more people than he could have imagined, Strummer and the
Clash helped lead them to alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   The Clash are scheduled to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame in March, and one thing's for sure: There won't be any blank
expressions that night when Strummer's name is read. There may even
be a few tears.</TE>

<HD>Two holiday heavyweights keep fans in their corners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>The last in a series of holiday essays.</SE>
<AU>Hillary Johnson</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone knows the holidays have their dark side. The underbelly of
holiday cheer is the conflict and strife that arises during the
pressure cooker that is Christmas, and one of the central points of
conflict each December is the age-old debate over which controversial
comestible best signifies the holiday spirit: eggnog or fruitcake?</LD>
<LD>   Once again, it's time to choose up sides. Pick your poison:</LD>
<LD>   Is it eggnog, that sweet, sticky beverage that has left many a
regional sales rep floating face-up in the office punchbowl for the
cleaning lady to find?</LD>
<TE>   Or fruitcake, a literally ancient dessert first eaten in the Roman
Empire (which means that, technically, fruitcake predates the
Christmas holiday itself)? At the Rendezvous Court in downtown Los
Angeles' Millennium Biltmore Hotel, server Tom Chavez comes down
squarely on the side of angels and eggnog, which flows copiously
every afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it. Every time I get a chance I sneak a little taste,"
Chavez says. The ladies who come for high tea like it too. "They like
a little sherry or brandy in it, then they like to have a little
more. And a little more still. Sometimes they get really drunk and I
have to cut them off."</TE>
<TE>   But Chavez balks at the idea of fruitcake.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like that stuff at all. We used to serve it, and it was
always left behind on the plate. They'd eat everything else and leave
the fruitcake. Now we serve tarts with lemon, mixed fruit and kiwi.
They go really well with eggnog."</TE>
<TE>   At Starbucks, the seasonal eggnog latte is an immensely popular
beverage. The mixing of eggnog and coffee flavors may seem unpleasant
at first whiff, but in fact the bitterness of the coffee cuts the
cloying sweetness of the eggnog, resulting in a tart, velveteen
beverage that is quite pleasant to consume.</TE>
<TE>   "It's surprising how good the combination is," says Starbucks
spokesperson Kelly Hewitt. "We've been serving it since the late
'80s, and it's one of our most popular items. We only sell it from
mid-November through January, but customers start asking for it as
soon as the weather turns."</TE>
<TE>   The absence of fruitcake from Starbucks' pastry case is glaringly
conspicuous.</TE>
<TE>   "Our cranberry bars are very popular this time of year," Hewitt
offers. "But when you walk into a store you'll probably see a
free-standing floor sign that says, 'Why do people bring fruitcake?'
It's part of our holiday ad campaign, encouraging people to give
coffee as a gift instead of fruitcake. It's a joke."</TE>
<TE>   Russ Cugno, proprietor of the Land of Fruits and Nuts aboard the
Queen Mary in Long Beach, begs to differ. Cugno has formed the
Fruitcake Antidefamation League Ltd., or FALL, four years ago for the
purpose of rehabilitating the dessert.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in the fruit and nut business, and I've had it with everyone
making fun of fruitcake!," Cugno fumes. "You say fruitcake and people
call you a nut head. So we formed FALL to help people with their
fruitcake awareness."</TE>
<TE>   If you haven't heard as many fruitcake jokes on the radio this
season, that may be due to Cugno's outreach efforts. "The incidence
of fruitcake-bashing is way down," he says. "In fact, we're almost
ready to declare victory this year."</TE>
<TE>   According to Cugno, modern fruitcake technology has progressed far
beyond the dense, thousand-year-old loaf of red and green cubes of
pickled mystery fruit that haunt most Americans' memories of
Christmas past (and lurks still in the back of some freezers).</TE>
<TE>   "These days there are chocolate cherry fruitcakes, and fruitcakes
made with almonds, apricots and brandy," Cugno rhapsodizes.</TE>
<TE>   According to Cugno, the modern fruitcake is so tasty that some
customers are even buying them for personal consumption, rather than
as gifts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they're proud of it," he laments. "They're
secretive. They won't admit that it's for them. It's still a little
bit like buying feminine hygiene products."</TE>
<TE>   Over in Van Nuys at the world headquarters of Dandy Don's Ice
Cream, owner Don Whittmore insists that the solution to the eggnog
versus fruitcake question is a big slice of fruitcake served a la
mode with a scoop of his eggnog ice cream, a rich, heady concoction
with a whiff of rum flavoring that is only available at specialty
stores like Howe's Market and gourmet restaurants that special-order
it.</TE>
<TE>   "Ours isn't eggnog-flavored, it's eggnog ice cream," he says. "We
use the whole egg. But every year I hope that someone will send me a
fruitcake so that I can put ice cream on it. My favorites are the
ones from Texas with lots of pecans."</TE>
<TE>   Better yet, if you are re-gifted with a fruitcake you suspect of
dating to the Roman Empire, don't call the Smithsonian, call Dandy
Don. "Bring your fruitcake to us, and we'll make it into fruitcake
ice cream for you! We'll make ice cream out of anything you like."</TE>
<TE>   So it is that we may consider the great fruitcake-eggnog debate
solved, at least for this year. Now we can turn our attention to
meatier questions, like what, exactly, is a sugarplum?</TE>

<LD>Did you take a walk today? Maybe you walked to or from school or went
over to a friend's house. What did you see along the way? Were there
flowers and trees? How about birds or insects?</LD>
<LD>   Artists often use elements like these in their works of art. By
doing so they are able to bring nature inside. Louis Comfort Tiffany
was one of these artists.</LD>
<LD>   Tiffany lived in New York from 1848 to 1933. He made home
furnishings such as lamps and vases and put elements from nature in
his designs.</LD>
<TE>   Take a look at this lamp. Tiffany designed it after a type of
plant that he liked. Do you recognize the plant? Here's a hint: The
lamp is called "Pond Lily Lamp."</TE>
<TE>   Pond lilies are flowers that grow in water. Their blooms sit on
circular green leaves called lily pads that float on the surface of
the water; the roots grow in the ground below. Pond lilies bloom in
many colors, including pink, yellow and white. Can you see the pond
lilies on the lampshade? What part of the lamp do the lily pads form?</TE>
<TE>   If you were an artist, what kind of lamp would you design? Would
you use elements from nature or something else? Maybe you would
rather design a vase or a table. On a piece of paper, design your own
object and put the things you like best in its design. Share your
creation with family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   You can see this lamp and others like it at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art. For general information, call (323) 857-6000 or visit

<HD>Show's four-legged stars get four-star treatment</HD>
<DH>A dozen animals take part in Radio City's holiday
spectacular, and someone has to look after them. That would be Bambi
Brook's job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sara Kugler</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Backstage at Radio City Music Hall, past the Rockettes' dressing
rooms, three camels, six sheep, two donkeys and a horse keep a woman
awake each night.</LD>
<LD>   But it's not the noise. Except for an occasional bleat from the
sheep, the four-legged stars of the "Christmas Spectacular" sleep
soundly. Their human handler, Bambi Brook, dozes fitfully in her
makeshift apartment across from the donkey pen and below the stage,
where she lives throughout the eight-week run of the show to take
24-hour care of her flock.</LD>
<LD>   "I run up and check the camels or make sure everybody is safe and
sleeping. I don't think I really sleep well for eight weeks, just
because the responsibility level is so great," Brook said. "You've
brought them into this environment, and you have to make sure they're
safe and comfortable."</LD>
<TE>   Brook wakes the animals at 5 a.m. each day and takes the horse and
camels outside for a walk on city streets that are just beginning to
swell with fast-walking workers and meandering tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Some passers-by stop to greet the camels, sometimes giving them
treats and always asking questions. No, they don't spit (these are
well-behaved theater camels), no, they're not cold (camels can adjust
their body temperature) and yes, they can have a bagel (hey, it's New
York).</TE>
<TE>   The camels, sheep and donkeys play themselves in a 10-minute
nativity scene at the close of the 90-minute show. The sheep and
donkeys ride the elevator up from their dressing room, one floor
below stage level, just passing the Rockettes coming off stage in
sparkly tights and reindeer hats.</TE>
<TE>   Brook and her assistants dress as shepherds or camel handlers and
guide the animals through the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Her company, Dawn Animal Agency, provides creatures for film and
television. The animals in the Christmas show rotate with others that
live on 250 acres in Westtown, N.Y., about 75 miles from Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Ted, the 10-year-old 1,400-pound camel with a prima donna
attitude, considered the star above all others, was home this week
for a break.</TE>
<TE>   Brook said the animals are watched for signs that they're tired or
not enjoying the work. How can she tell?</TE>
<TE>   "Look, he's making happy ears at us," Brook said, hanging over the
edge of the horse pen, pointing at Angel, a white horse who pulls a
carriage across the stage past dancers and ice skaters in a scene
called "White Christmas in New York." With ears earnestly upright,
Angel munched a mouthful of hay.</TE>
<TE>   And sure enough, his ears were similarly cocked forward during
that day's first show.</TE>
<TE>   Brook struggles to explain how she gets animals to perform.
Sometimes she can't even describe it to her assistants.</TE>
<TE>   More than being trained, she said, animals have to trust that
"they're going to be safe in any environment, whether it's on the
street or in the theater or on the farm," said Brook, a small,
muscular woman who talks so fast that she often interrupts herself.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Agriculture also checks on the furry
performers, making surprise visits to Radio City to examine sleeping
areas and to watch the performance to make sure they're treated well.</TE>
<TE>   Brook's mother founded the talent agency and the Sanctuary for
Animals in 1960 with 30 creatures. Now, more than 750 live there --
75% of them rescued. They are guaranteed a home, even if they are not
among the 10% to 15% that perform.</TE>
<TE>   The agency won't say what the animals are paid for their work, but
Brook said the Christmas show, which they've been doing for more than
20 years, is essential to the operation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our big moneymaking project for the sanctuary, and
without this contract, the sanctuary wouldn't be able to help as many
animals as it does," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The animals in the show don't perform elsewhere during the year.
But the agency keeps busy providing animals for high-profile
television shows like "Law &amp; Order," which always needs rats, and
"Sex and the City," where one of their dogs had a long run as Pete,
the pet of Carrie's ex-fiance, Aidan.</TE>

<HD>Social D's message still loud and clear</HD>
<DH>The punk band begins its string of holiday concerts at the
House of Blues with resonant themes that have made its music relevant
for more than two decades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was nothing silent about the first night of Social Distortion's
annual winter residency Sunday at the House of Blues Anaheim, where
the Orange County punk mainstay opened a string of at least 17 shows
divvied up between the chain's Anaheim and West Hollywood clubs over
the next three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Despite getting started just three days shy of Christmas, Social D
indulged in no hollow holiday sentimentality, which is one reason
that this relatively new Southland Christmas season tradition is so
bracing.</LD>
<LD>   Outfitted in auto mechanic's overalls, leader Mike Ness set about
his work with a solo rendition of "When the Angels Sing," his anthem
to lost loved ones. He spit forth not just anger but also refusal to
be bowed by the bloody punches life can deliver.</LD>
<TE>   Ness' ability to elucidate a willingness to take those punches and
come back for more has kept Social D relevant for more than two
decades. It was clear on the faces of the predominantly male crowd
that Ness' survivor instincts have made him a role model for a
generation of young rebels.</TE>
<TE>   The group's bracing 70-minute set touched familiar bases,
stretching back to its beginnings with "Mommy's Little Monster" and
across the years with "Prison Bound," "Story of My Life" and "Sick
Boys" on up to "Dear Lover" and "Angels Sing" from its most recent
studio album, 1996's "White Light White Heat White Trash."</TE>
<TE>   Even though most of the newer songs offered Sunday were familiar
to those who were at last year's House of Blues gigs, they extend the
in-your-face wallop, disarming vulnerability and keen melodic sense
that have long set Ness' songwriting above that of so many of punk's
one-note ranters.</TE>

<LD>Sierra Madre is a fine place to be when a rainstorm hits. In the
foothills, weather is often a bit more dramatic than it is in the
valleys or the flats -- come December, the rain falls hard and cold
and sudden. In minutes, the steep streets have whitecaps in their
gutters.</LD>
<LD>   A recent rain came up fast even by Sierra Madre standards. A
narrow edge of mist along the hilltops swiftly became a mass of dark
clouds that swept across a Christmas blue sky as if summoned by Peter
Jackson. For a few seconds, Baldwin Avenue, one of the town's main
streets, was split in two, evenly divided between sun and storm. Then
lightning dutifully flashed and rain rattled onto concrete and car
roofs like a huge sack of marbles split open.</LD>
<LD>   In the Four Seasons Tea Room, the sound of strings and harpsichord
was submerged for a moment and a group of women in holiday sweaters
peered over their cups, through a window gone blind with rain. Four
more women dashed up the steps of the converted bungalow, their pink
and red hats wilted only slightly beneath their umbrellas.</LD>
<TE>   Members of a Pasadena chapter of the Red Hat Society -- ladies of
a certain age who meet occasionally for fun and mischief and, very
often, tea -- they were here to exchange holiday gifts, which
included membership pins of fabric shaped to look like red flowers
with tiny teapots attached.</TE>
<TE>   "Our oldest member is 85," said Erma Taylor Stark from under the
garlanded brim of her hat. She was holding a purse shaped like a pink
watering can. "And she just got a tattoo."</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Madre takes pride in its size -- fewer than 12,000 people.
But just because a town's quaint -- there's an old-fashioned
revolving pie rack in the window of the PepperTree Grill -- doesn't
mean it's backward. Bean Town, the local coffeehouse, offers
smoothies and all the obligatory baked goods -- biscotti,
softball-sized muffins -- and at Savor the Flavor, a specialty food
and gifts emporium, the hot items this year are olive dishes, which
have actually sold out, and olive oil bottles to be used to hold dish
soap.</TE>
<TE>   Braving the rain, one woman ducked in and breathlessly inquired
after a bottle that would hold both oil and vinegar. They didn't have
it; neither did they have just "plain chocolate" that another woman
desired. "We only have fancy chocolate left," said clerk Lori Lama,
laughing. "Look at that," she added, peering through the window at
the rain. The drops had turned again, now fat and determined,
battering flat the red and yellow leaves splayed on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Tea Room owner Kelly Santos has lived in Sierra Madre for 16
years; she and her mother opened the tea room six years ago. Santos
thinks the town is pretty much the same as it was when she was in
high school. "Although I remember when Bean Town was tiny and now
it's huge," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A couple doors south of the tea room, Bean Town is reachable with
a few splash-hurried steps. Inside, there are white metal-topped
kitchen tables, several sofas, a computer station, a bookshelf full
of board games, several piles of newspaper and, on this day, about a
dozen folks studying, talking and watching the rain.</TE>
<TE>   "You look like you're in Minnesota," said manager Rod Diener to a
man who walked in wearing a windbreaker and a red ski cap.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, the wind kicked up and then it was hailing, so ... " the
main shrugged; he was a big man and it was a big movement that
whistled with the fabric of his coat.</TE>
<TE>   On the counter by the cash registers there was a little jar with a
sign requesting donations for the "Snowman Fund." According to
Diener, each year a man named Dave Forrester goes up into the
mountains and gets three truckloads of snow so he can make a snowman
in Kersting Court on Christmas Day. Last year, there was no snow to
be found and so Forrester bought a bunch of shaved ice in Monrovia
and made snow.</TE>
<TE>   "Cost him like 400 bucks," said Diener, "so we thought we'd help
him out this year. Only," he looked out the window where the rain had
blown itself long and thin, the kind of rain with a bite to it, "it
looks like there'll be plenty of snow this year."</TE>
<TE>   Kersting Court is the heart of downtown Sierra Madre, an island at
the intersection of Baldwin and Sierra Madre Boulevard. A week before
Christmas, it was occupied by a larger-than-life-size manger scene
awaiting the arrival of Baby Jesus. But there was plenty of room yet
for a good-sized snowman.</TE>
<TE>   As 2 o'clock ticked on to 3, Bean Town filled up with pretty girls
in blue jeans and pea coats and couples panting a bit because they'd
run through the wet. Entering, everyone blinked a bit, automatically
smiled at the warmth and the dry, and their cheeks were red like they
should be at Christmastime in a small town, even in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   There is something about the holidays that cries out for time
spent in a small town, for the "I love you, Bedford Falls" moment of
lights and weather and storefronts. Sierra Madre is pretty close to
perfect for that, though there are others around too -- Montrose,
Monrovia, South Pasadena all have charming shopping districts and the
feeling of dug-in residence sought after now by commercial architects
and designers.</TE>
<TE>   In these towns the ambience is home-grown, which means it's lovely
and slightly weird, like the image of Sierra Madre's famous
108-year-old Wisteria, emblazoned on everything from T-shirts to the
holiday gift wrap, like the weather that comes up suddenly and is
whisked away just as fast.</TE>
<TE>   Moments after a deluge, the streets were glazed with sunshine and
in the west, unbelievably enough, a double rainbow arced, ending
somewhere in the hills wet with winter. Chances are not good around
here for snow, even in the hills, even at Christmastime, but the
rain'll do.</TE>

<DH>Couple struggles but finds hope in the aftermath of the
region's worst freeway accident. It was 'the last thing we expected.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gayle Pollard-Terry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Heather Fay, blond and outgoing, loves company. Back-to-back visitors
pack the small house near Pasadena that she shares with her equally
outgoing boyfriend, Rob Phillips.</LD>
<LD>   Her mom recently stayed a month. In the time it took to wash the
sheets and towels, two girlfriends flew out from her hometown in
Connecticut.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, "things are getting back to normal," she says, the night
before her house guests are scheduled to leave.</LD>
<TE>   The alarm blares at 4:30 a.m., allowing plenty of time to drive to
the Long Beach Airport for an early-morning bargain flight.</TE>
<TE>   It is Sunday, Nov. 3, a day that will be asterisked in the record
books when 216 cars, SUVs, pick-ups and big rigs collide on a foggy
stretch of the 710 in the biggest freeway accident in the history of
Southern California. The chain reaction rips off fenders, crunches
trunks, twists hoods, shatters windows. Two massive knots, one
involving 114 vehicles, the other 53, block the Del Amo exit and
about five miles of the southbound lanes near the 405. A smaller
tangle of nine cars strangles the northbound lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, no one dies.</TE>
<TE>   But in the crumpled, bent crush of car after car after truck after
car, more than 100 are injured, among them Phillips, Fay and her two
friends. That's their little black Honda, spun sideways at the center
of the largest knot of cars, in the AP photograph that made front
pages across the country. For them, and many others in the middle of
it all, the accident hasn't stopped.</TE>
<TE>   It is before sunrise.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, the only guy in the house, is the last out of bed, the
last in the car. He climbs behind the wheel of Fay's '94 Honda Civic.
She's beside him, her friends behind them. They buckle up. She
fastens a seat belt recently repaired by her mother after the dog
chewed through it.</TE>
<TE>   As they drive along the 710, a wall of fog envelops them. Fay, who
admits she's "a terrible back-seat driver," cautions, "Brake lights,
Rob."</TE>
<TE>   Ten cars, or is it 20, brake in front of them. He brakes, too. The
Honda keeps going. In the thick, wet fog, it feels as if he is
driving on ice.</TE>
<TE>   Spinning sideways, sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding, she says,
"for what seems like forever."</TE>
<TE>   Bam.</TE>
<TE>   They're hit. On the driver's side? Yes? No? On the passenger's
side?</TE>
<TE>   Bam.</TE>
<TE>   They're hit again. How many times? Who knows.</TE>
<TE>   At 6:40, the California Highway Patrol rolls.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach Fire Department also responds.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighter Jan Andriese is already on the scene, in his green
Toyota pick-up near the beginning of the accident, not very far from
the Honda and the cars in front and back of it. He is not in uniform
yet because he's heading to work at Fire Station 1 in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   When fog snuffs out most visibility and brake lights suddenly get
brighter, he veers left and hits his brakes. He braces for impact.</TE>
<TE>   No one touches him.</TE>
<TE>   He hears "that distinct sound of cars sliding on the payment." He
sees "about 10 people running." Some jump the median and rush onto
the northbound lanes of the 710, "causing cars to spin out of
control." Nine cars are rear-ending or getting rear-ended and
swerving to get out of the way of the big rig busting through the
divider.</TE>
<TE>   Andriese starts to get out of his truck. He stops when another big
rig "plows into a lot of cars to the right of me." That jolt smashes
dozens of scattered cars and trucks into a compact cluster. The
Honda, T-boned by other cars, sits at the front of that clump.</TE>
<TE>   Bam.</TE>
<TE>   "STAY IN THE CAR," Phillips screams.</TE>
<TE>   "GET OUT! GET OUT!" Fay shouts.</TE>
<TE>   Everything slows down for him.</TE>
<TE>   "The second of impact, in which I was injured, was slow motion.
That second seemed like five minutes, and then...." Images of
paralyzed people float through his mind. He sees his friend who has
no legs. OK. OK. Don't freak out, he tells himself. Wiggle your toes.
Good. Move your legs.</TE>
<TE>   Everything speeds up for her.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a-hundred-miles running," he says. Propelled by images of
the only other car wreck she has been in, she climbs through the
smashed rear window -- or does she? -- and runs down the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   She can't see very well because the impact broke her glasses, but
she makes out car parts flying around. She hears car after car after
car. Bam. Bam. Bam. Bam.</TE>
<TE>   What should she do? Where should she go? A fatherly voice calls,
"Over here! Over here!" She rushes to an "older gentleman." He is as
scared as she is.</TE>
<TE>   Strangers are pulling her boyfriend out of the Honda. He's not
sure he wants to get out. Shouldn't he wait for the paramedics?</TE>
<TE>   He's out. He's on the ground looking up at "mountains of cars,
tons of cars." He's lying "about two feet from a stream of diesel
fuel." He can't walk. He can't stand. He's thankful to be alive and
"not crushed ... not oatmeal."</TE>
<TE>   The accident continues.</TE>
<TE>   When the commotion stops around his pickup, Andriese gets out to
help. He climbs over cars, makes his way around the mangled cluster,
notes two streams of fuel flowing from trucks. He and an off-duty
L.A. County firefighter stabilize "a gentleman in fatigues." Hurt in
the accident and hit again after he stepped out of his car, he has a
broken nose, facial bones, ribs and an arm. He also bleeds
internally. He goes in and out of consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips fractures his pelvis in three places.</TE>
<TE>   "Heather! Heather! Heaaatherrrr!" he screams. "Why did she leave
me?"</TE>
<TE>   Standing on the side of the 710, she asks herself, Where's Rob?
Where are Felicia and Maria? Why aren't they right behind me? "Rob!
Felicia! Maria!"</TE>
<TE>   Felicia Izzo answers and follows her friend's voice. They find
Maria Jacobs and finally locate Phillips, lying there listening to
the sounds of more cars crashing in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   The accident continues.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics arrive, assess the injured and set up tarps for triage,
treatment and transport.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips and Fay, each in a cervical collar, lie side by side. His
body board drips diesel fuel. She begs the paramedics to keep them
all together. Ambulances rush the couple to Long Beach Memorial
Hospital, her friends to another emergency room. They are among 41
victims transported to eight area hospitals. The remaining 50 or so
injured are assessed as "walking wounded."</TE>
<TE>   In the emergency room, their clothes reeking of diesel fuel,
Phillips and Fay are interviewed by CHP officers before they're
treated.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the accident scene, before 8 a.m., the CHP investigators
scour the pavement for evidence, skid marks, scrapes and gouges. They
find little because the ground is wet.</TE>
<TE>   Andriese, the firefighter, helps Engine 11 put down absorbent to
sop up the leaking fuel.</TE>
<TE>   He returns to his truck. "It's sit and wait." For hours.</TE>
<TE>   By now, more than 50 CHP officers, 42 firefighters and 10
paramedics work the accident. Long Beach police officers provide
logistical support.</TE>
<TE>   Buses arrive, offering a place to sit for the more than 200
motorists and passengers who are stranded, waiting to be interviewed.
The Red Cross brings food and facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Tow trucks show up by the dozen.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before 3 p.m., Andriese is one of the first to drive away,
because his truck -- without a scratch -- is relatively easy to
extricate. He heads to work.</TE>
<TE>   At Long Beach Memorial Hospital, Fay is treated for a cracked
nose, facial lacerations, back and neck pain. Her room is next to
Phillips'.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I go next door to see my girlfriend?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   She waves to him on her way to a CAT scan.</TE>
<TE>   He's admitted; she's treated and released but refuses to leave
him. She crawls into his hospital bed.</TE>
<TE>   Neither has health insurance. His job as a cashier at Wild Oats in
Pasadena offers coverage for employees and significant others. He's
been waiting months for the November sign-up.</TE>
<TE>   Where are their house guests? A nurse calls around and finds them.
Izzo has been treated for a cracked rib, Jacobs for severe back
spasms. They want to go home. Now. Their suitcases, in the trunk of
the Honda, can be sent later. No more L.A. freeways. They head to
Long Beach Memorial, say their goodbyes to Fay and Phillips. They
check into a hotel near their original destination, the Long Beach
Airport, and are settled in by 5 p.m., about the time the last
motorist is leaving the accident scene.</TE>
<TE>   The girlfriends fly out on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Fay faces the ride home. As she passes that spot on the freeway,
she freaks out.</TE>
<TE>   In the days following the pileup, drivers zip along the 710, free
of any reminder of the massive jumbles of vehicles or injured
motorists. A few patients remain hospitalized, among them the most
severely hurt, a 77-year-old woman who suffered bleeding around her
heart and several fractures.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Phillips is discharged. A friend picks him up. When
they reach the house, he struggles with the walker. It takes him 45
minutes to travel the eight feet from the car, up two steps, into the
house. He cannot work for 60 to 90 days, on doctor's advice. No work.
No pay.</TE>
<TE>   The accident sucker-punches the young couple, setting off another
chain reaction.</TE>
<TE>   How will they pay the hospital bills? His is $24,000; hers is more
than $12,000. The rent?</TE>
<TE>   Bam.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Fay starts work as a waitress at a coffee shop, one of
a series of survival jobs that frees the Boston University graduate
and aspiring filmmaker to work on her reel. She's doing spec
commercials, a music video for Phillips' ex-girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   The accident puts everything on hold. On $8 an hour, she must
support both of them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really tough. It's not easy," Phillips says. The accident is
"the last thing we needed. The last thing we expected."</TE>
<TE>   The first couple of weeks are hard. Fay is frustrated because she
must do everything.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, equally frustrated, lies there asking, "What do you want
me to do? OK. Fine. I'll do nothing but sit here. I can't do
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Bam.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different story if one of you is injured and has gone
through something traumatic, and the other can stand up and just
totally take over," she says. "When you both go through it, it's
harder."</TE>
<TE>   She has "a lot of emotional stuff going on."</TE>
<TE>   He asks her what's wrong. "What am I supposed to do? Emotionally,
I [have] nothing to give."</TE>
<TE>   She's guilt-tripping.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't mean to leave you," she says of her escape from the car.
"I thought you guys were behind me...."</TE>
<TE>   "Heather, I've never -- I'm not trying to blame you," he says.</TE>
<TE>   She still has a hard time.</TE>
<TE>   They visit her totaled car at a tow yard in the San Fernando
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "You realize how much you're actually in shock when an accident
happens when you see [the car] two weeks later and go, Oh, I don't
remember any of this stuff. Is this the same car that was in the
accident?" he says. "Did you guys hit it another a couple more times
with a couple of other cars? Did you guys throw it around with the
big trucks?"</TE>
<TE>   She sits in the car, her first. For 45 minutes, she goes over the
accident in her mind. She relives it. She cries. "Sitting in the seat
where I was when it all went down" makes her sick.</TE>
<TE>   She has car insurance, though not medical reimbursement. She
expects a check, no replacement for a paid-off car. They contemplate
another new bill.</TE>
<TE>   Bam.</TE>
<TE>   They cut back. They get rid of cable. They borrow money from their
parents to pay December rent.</TE>
<TE>   Bam.</TE>
<TE>   A month after the accident, Phillips gives up the walker. He moves
awkwardly, stiffly, jerking like a marionette. Against the doctor's
advice, he's "fighting to get back [to work] because I don't have any
money. I'm on disability but my checks haven't come."</TE>
<TE>   Friends arrive bearing shoes -- he never got his diesel-soaked
belongings from the hospital. He loves the shoes, perfect for
skateboarding, which is how he used to get to work. They bring a
stack of videos too. "Movie charity," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He keeps busy playing his guitar, painting, worrying about next
month's rent.</TE>
<TE>   Five weeks after the accident, his disability check comes. They
can pay January rent. The car insurance check is in the mail. No more
small cars for her. They buy a used Jeep.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel safer," Fay says. "I'm higher up. I have better
visibility." She ups her car insurance coverage, expecting a huge
increase. Surprise. The bill gets smaller. But she still fears
driving on the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks since the collision, the pain is getting better, the
tears less frequent. No house guests are scheduled to come for the
holidays. A little Christmas tree lights up their house. Today, more
than seven weeks after the crash, CHP investigators continue to
reconstruct the pile-up. They do not know what set off the chain
reaction that crushed cars, shattered bones and jolted the lives of
more than 200 drivers and their passengers, including one young
couple's. Bam.</TE>

<LD>Principal filming is scheduled to start early next month in Prague,
Czech Republic, on a CBS miniseries covering the early life and
political rise of Adolf Hitler, a project that drew criticism from
Jewish leaders and others when it was announced last summer.</LD>
<LD>   Despite calls for CBS to back away from the miniseries, the
project, which is being produced by Alliance-Atlantis, took on a new
screenwriter and continued development. Its cast includes Robert
Carlyle as Hitler, Stockard Channing as Hitler's mother, and Peter
O'Toole as Paul von Hindenburg, who was president of the Weimar
Republic during Hitler's rise in Germany.</LD>
<LD>   The miniseries is slated to air during the May ratings sweeps.</LD>

<LD>OK, now, no jokes about fossil fuels: The Rolling Stones are
returning to Los Angeles with a special free concert at Staples
Center to raise awareness about global warming.</LD>
<LD>   The Feb. 6 show will bang the drum for the Natural Resources
Defense Council and should cause a flurry of interest from fans with
its ticket giveaway.</LD>
<LD>   Fans can enter a sweepstakes to win two free tickets by filling
out the entry form at www.nrdcstonesconcert.org or by mailing a 3x5
index card with their name, address, telephone number and date of
birth to "NRDC Stones Concert, P.O. Box 15099, North Hollywood, CA
91615-5099."</LD>
<TE>   No donation is required to enter or win tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Any Stones show remains one of the hottest tickets in all of
music, and the New York-based advocacy group is thrilled with the
prospect of the publicity the concert will engender. The group has
500,000 members and for 30 years has championed research and
legislation to protect the environment.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rolling Stones' commitment will help build unprecedented
support for NRDC efforts to fight global warming," said council
President John H. Adams.</TE>
<TE>   The Stones are finishing up the North American leg of their tour,
one of the highest-grossing road runs of 2002, and they will launch
the international leg in Australia on Feb. 18, with shows to follow
in Asia and Europe.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Charlton Heston, in what may be one of his final acting roles, is
climbing aboard the chariot one more time, narrating and providing
the voice of the title character in a new animated version of
"Ben-Hur" that airs at 7 tonight on Christian broadcaster TBN.</LD>
<LD>   Heston's son, Fraser, is one of the producers of the program,
which repeats at 2 p.m. Wednesday and at midnight Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The animated "Hur" is based more on Lew Wallace's original novel
than the 1959 William Wyler film that earned Heston a best actor
Oscar. The actor and National Rifle Assn. president recently
announced that he is suffering from the effects of Alzheimer's
disease.</LD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Strangely funereal, the "Miracles and Mischief" exhibition at the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art presents artifacts of the Japanese Noh
and Kyogen theaters as if they belonged to a lost world rather than
an enduring performing tradition. You half expect mummy cases or, at
the very least, gravestones.</LD>
<LD>   In dim light and behind glass, the antique masks, costumes,
musical instruments and scroll paintings suggest the unique stillness
and splendor of the Noh drama, but nothing of its intensity and
conceptual rigor. Video clips on a few monitors convey (at very low
volume levels) impressions of the objects on stage, the way the play
of light can transform them as an actor moves. But if you come to
LACMA from the world of the theater, the approach seems dangerously
incomplete.</LD>
<LD>   Dating back more than 600 years, Noh remains an uncompromisingly
anti-material idiom, insisting that the riches, pleasures and
relationships of this world are all an illusion. So an exhibition
that ignores the spirit of Noh to focus on the apparel quickly
becomes unsatisfying -- and even arguably anti-Noh. But it suits the
philosophy of the Kyogen, the comic counterpart to Noh, that
highlights the schemes and temptations of daily life.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, some of the conditions of the exhibition were dictated
by the fragility of costumes that can no longer bear their own weight
and masks painted with pigments in danger of fading. But even on its
own terms, this first comprehensive U.S. survey of Noh and Kyogen
lore remains short on context, more interested in displaying costumes
in isolation as gorgeously patterned textiles than showing how the
various pieces might be layered on, and wrapped around, a living,
moving body.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of their colors can be best appreciated in the
extensive published catalog, the costumes repay careful attention for
their intricate workmanship and varied decorative techniques.</TE>
<TE>   A nearly transparent 18th century silk-gauze robe in soft green,
with a bamboo pattern in gold leaf, looks like it could float on a
single breath, while many of the sumptuously embroidered patchwork
costumes seem heavy enough to reinforce the weighty, ceremonial
footwork of Noh dancing.</TE>
<TE>   (Those with a special interest in the costumes should time their
visit to include one of the docent-led tours on Thursdays and Sundays
at 2 p.m.; the detailed insights about weaving and methods of
embellishment prove fascinating when specific examples can be
examined at length.)</TE>
<TE>   Arranged like decapitated heads, the masks freeze characteristics
of age, class and temperament in formal sculptural statements without
losing the spark of life.</TE>
<TE>   Side by side, two versions of the horned Hannya demon mask brood
magnificently, one dated 1558, the other from the 15th to 16th
century.</TE>
<TE>   Even in an intimate Noh theater, they might look identical, but
here you can savor their differences of color, variations in shape,
degrees of dignity and malevolence.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally curator Sharon Sadako Takeda provides a life-size
photograph of a Noh dancer in full regalia, or a showcase in which
all the items that an actor would need to portray a certain role are
gathered together. Most of the time, however, the vital connections
are missing.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the exhibition, you find the mask of Otobide --
all gold except for the wide, open mouth, and remarkable for the
gleam in its bulging metal eyes. But who is this character? What does
he do? What vision of human existence does he embody? The exhibition
tells you practically nothing, the catalog a little more. Perhaps the
talks and screenings and workshops and classes related to the
exhibition will help fill in the blanks.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the most important questions about Noh can only be
answered by the greatest dancing actors keeping the tradition alive
in this new century. And their artistry is absent or marginalized at
LACMA.</TE>

<LD>Maria and Alfonso were visiting Uncle Ruben in the San Bernardino
Mountains, where he worked as a nature guide and caretaker
year-round. It was almost Christmas and Uncle Ruben noticed that
Maria seemed a little quiet and sad.</LD>
<LD>   "What's wrong?" he asked her.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted to get my mother a Christmas gift," said Maria. "But I
don't have anything yet, and there's no way I can get her something
up here."</LD>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben smiled. He asked Maria and Alfonso to dress warmly,
and they hiked into the woods.</TE>
<TE>   On the edge of a clearing, where the snow was light, Uncle Ruben
showed Maria the old flower stalks of plants that had already died.
He picked some dry grasses, some dry curly dock seed stalks, and
three other dried-up stalks. He tied them all together in a small
bundle and gave it to Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, that's really pretty!" exclaimed Maria. "Mother will love
it."</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben noticed that Alfonso was now looking at him. "Let's
keep walking," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Where an old tree had fallen, Uncle Ruben began to poke the large
trunk with his walking stick. There was a rounded part where a branch
had long ago broken off, and the tree healed itself. "See that?" he
asked Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben picked up the burl and began carving it with his
pocketknife. He paused for a moment and looked seriously at Alfonso
and Maria. "Remember, children, don't try something like this
yourself until you are old enough to handle a knife and an adult is
nearby to supervise," instructed Uncle Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   "We know," chimed Alfonso and Maria together.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso watched with amazement as Uncle Ruben created a wooden
bowl in a matter of minutes from what seemed to be a rotten piece of
wood. "Wow!" said Alfonso. "Dad will really like that."</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben smiled, and they walked some more. He picked up some
dried vines and a few red toyon berries. "These berries were dried or
cooked and eaten by the Indians in the old days," explained Uncle
Ruben. He twisted the vines into a wreath and worked in the berries.
"Here, now you can both take this wreath home with you," he told the
excited children.</TE>
<TE>   Before they went back to the lodge, they sat on a log, talking.</TE>
<TE>   "The forest is full of treasures, if you know how to look for
them," said Uncle Ruben. "So I am glad that these things have made
you happy. But remember that Christmas is a special time for many
people. The joy of Christmas is best experienced by spending time
with your family. When you focus only on gifts and objects, we lose
the real meaning of the holiday."</TE>
<TE>   "We're really glad we came here to visit you," said Maria with a
broad smile.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," said Alfonso. "Thank you! You really made our Christmas!"</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When ServiceMaster Co. hired Peter F. Drucker as a consultant years
ago, he went to a board meeting and asked the directors a simple
question: What business are you in? One director replied, "Lawn care,
home security...." Another chimed in, "And pest control and house
cleaning...."</LD>
<LD>   "Wrong," Drucker said. "You're in the business of training and
deploying people."</LD>
<LD>   Whether looking at a single company or a society in flux, Drucker
has long been known for his ability to see the big picture more
clearly than most. Drucker, the author of 35 books and hundreds of
articles on business management, is the subject this time as CNBC
presents "Peter Drucker: An Intellectual Journey" at 4 p.m. and 7
p.m. today.</LD>
<TE>   Writer-director Ken Witty's one-hour documentary is a smart, if
occasionally fawning, portrait of the 93-year-old writer, teacher and
consultant.</TE>
<TE>   The show traces Drucker's early years in 1920s Vienna, his
opposition to the Nazis as a young journalist in Europe, his economic
studies with John Maynard Keynes while working as an investment
banker in 1930s London and highlights of his writings in the U.S.
after he immigrated in 1937.</TE>
<TE>   Before Drucker wrote "The End of Economic Man" in 1939, there had
been little scholarly work on business management. Drucker, who saw
business as an organized activity and not just a process of buying
low and selling high, followed with influential works such as
"Concept of the Corporation" in 1945, his inside look at General
Motors.</TE>
<TE>   Drucker's work goes beyond business management, however.
Considered a pioneer in the field of demography, Drucker saw the
dawning of the "knowledge society" in his 1969 book, "The Age of
Discontinuity."</TE>
<TE>   If a biography of the father of modern management seems like odd
Christmas Eve programming, consider that CNBC filled one slow news
day a few years ago with highlights from the Los Angeles Times'
investment conference.</TE>
<TE>   Scrooges might call Drucker an appropriate choice anyway for the
ultimate capitalist holiday, but he captures the Christmas spirit in
another sense, too: as a guiding light for the nonprofit groups he
has worked with over the years.</TE>

<LD>Kean appointment -- In a story in Section A on Dec. 17 about the
appointment of former New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean to head a
federal commission to investigate the events preceding the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, The Times incorrectly reported the number of
Aramark Corp. employees who died at the World Trade Center. The
number of Aramark fatalities was seven, not "about 80." Kean is a
board member of Aramark, which operated a food court and other
concessions at the center.</LD>

<LD>Diuretics -- A story on nonprescription diuretic therapies for
hypertension, which appeared in Monday's Health section, contained
two errors in the listings of prescription diuretics. In the listing
of thiazides, a class of diuretic, the story incorrectly named
Dyazide as a brand name for hydrochlorothiazide. Dyazide is actually
a more complex medication that contains two diuretics:
hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene. Also, the loop diuretic known
commercially as Lasix is not fursemide, as the story stated, but
furosemide.</LD>

<LD>Planning department -- Two stories in the California section about
the Orange County Planning Department's financial problems contained
inaccuracies. An article Saturday incorrectly reported that the
department may have to place $10 million in planning fees into a
special fund until a judge rules whether the money was properly
spent. In fact, the money will be put into the fund permanently if a
judge rules that it was spent improperly. A story Sunday reported
incorrectly that a judge has ruled that the department misspent $12
million from a fund containing building permit fees. The judge has
not yet ruled on the issue.</LD>

<HD>Amgen Set to Double Production of Enbrel</HD>
<DH>Firm says FDA OK of cleaned-up plant will help it meet
demand for arthritis drug</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The patient waiting list already had soared to tens of thousands for
the rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel when Amgen Inc. sent its biotech
SWAT team of 100 experts to Rhode Island last spring on a critical
mission: to clean up a drug factory and get it ready for production
by year-end.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the mission was accomplished when the Food and Drug
Administration signed off on the two-story plant that houses a
network of stainless-steel vats connected by 25 miles of pipe.</LD>
<LD>   The agency's approval of the West Greenwich plant means that Amgen
now could double its shipments of Enbrel, which analysts said would
add up to $700 million to Amgen's projected $7.8 billion in overall
revenue next year. The drug also is made at a factory in Germany.</LD>
<TE>   Making biotechnology drugs is not like stamping out Barbie dolls
or assembling cars. Companies splice bits of DNA into live cells,
which in turn pump out the medication. Throughout the process, a
biotech factory has to meet FDA cleanliness standards, which are far
more rigorous than those of hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   The Rhode Island plant "would never have passed FDA inspection"
without a major overhaul, said Fabrizio Bonanni, the Amgen senior
vice president who led the SWAT team.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen acquired the factory and a potential blockbuster in Enbrel
when it purchased biotech rival Immunex Corp. for $9.6 billion in
July. Enbrel was approved for sale in 1998, and the drug is seen as
an effective tool to combat serious joint damage and disability so
severe that a person can end up in a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   When Amgen inherited the Enbrel factory, more than 40,000 people
suffering from arthritis were on a waiting list for the drug. Unable
to obtain it, doctors had begun prescribing an alternative made by
Johnson &amp; Johnson called Remicade, which also combats joint damage
and pain but has more serious side effects. Patients and their
insurers pay about $12,000 a year for twice-weekly injections of
Enbrel.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks-based Amgen, the world's largest biotech company,
was convinced that if it could find a way to keep up with the demand
for Enbrel, the drug could be a $3-billion-a-year product.</TE>
<TE>   But first it had to whip the Rhode Island factory into shape.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen's start was inauspicious. Bonanni arrived at the plant
outside Providence in January, just after the Immunex deal had been
announced. Personnel there, he recalled, refused to share key
information with him, forcing him to develop a set of plans for
improvements based largely on conjecture and intuition.</TE>
<TE>   When Bonanni's SWAT team showed up a few months later, one of the
most important mysteries they needed to solve was why so many batches
of Enbrel were going bad. The FDA requires a minimum success rate of
60% of all drug production runs, and the Rhode Island factory was
below that minimum. (By contrast, Amgen says its other factories have
a 90%-plus success rate.)</TE>
<TE>   The team eventually discovered that there was no one reason for
the failures. Rather, there was a litany of problems.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, leaky valves and ill-fitting filters caused Amgen to
throw out batches of Enbrel that could have been stockpiled for
patients. And clean rooms where the drug was prepared and processed
were full of trace bacteria and mold.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the troubles was that the 350 workers at the factory
were insufficiently trained, Bonanni said.</TE>
<TE>   Once, noticing Enbrel dripping from a tank, Bonanni scolded the
production crew for "wasting gold." He further humiliated them by
crawling on the floor to find the source of the leak. After that, he
said, crews made sure the valves on the tanks were closed.</TE>
<TE>   Bonanni and his team brought two decades of biotech experience
with them to Rhode Island. One of the first things they changed was
how the janitors wiped down the factory walls and mopped the floors
to remove contaminants. He also assigned Amgen supervisors to shadow
Immunex factory workers until they mastered their daily tasks.</TE>
<TE>   The hamster cells used to make Enbrel are grown in large vats that
contain a broth of nutrients and vitamins, kept at just the right
temperature. The smallest change in conditions can kill cells or
reduce their ability to make the drug.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a zillion ways things can go wrong," said Deb
Chakravarti, a professor at the Keck Graduate Institute of Applied
Life Sciences in Claremont. "A mistake in the wrong place can wipe
out the whole lot."</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the factory approval is important for Amgen. Abbott
Laboratories Inc. is preparing to introduce a similar medication that
is likely to appeal to many of the same patients that have been
waiting for Enbrel. Amgen's stock closed Monday at $51.64, up 16
cents, on Nasdaq. The FDA's approval was announced after the market
had closed.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen's chief executive, Kevin Sharer, hailed completion of the
factory and credited Bonanni with getting the job done. "The smartest
thing I did was sending Fabrizio in early," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Bonanni noted that it took some time to gain the
trust of the Immunex employees in Rhode Island. But in the end, all
but a dozen or so have stayed on with Amgen.</TE>

<HD>BofA to Write Off $1.2 Billion in Loans</HD>
<DH>Larger-than-expected allocation follows bankruptcy filing
by United Airlines. Tax gain will offset losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bank of America Corp. said Monday that it will set aside $1.2 billion
in the fourth quarter for bad loans, more than analysts expected,
after the bankruptcy filing of an airline that investors identified
as UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.</LD>
<LD>   The third-biggest U.S. bank said a tax gain of $488 million in the
quarter will offset higher loan losses. Net income for the year will
be as much as $5.97 a share, the bank said, more than the $5.68
forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Rising loan losses at Bank of America, which wrote off $804
million in the third quarter under Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis,
signal that bad loans will crimp bank profit into 2003. About 13% of
$1.9 trillion in U.S. bank loans to companies were in default or
unlikely to be repaid at the end of June, the biggest proportion
since 1992, according to a study by federal regulators.</LD>
<TE>   "Between the airlines, technology companies and energy companies,
there are going to be more and more announcements of credit
charge-offs," said Phil Larkins, market strategist for Legacy South
Inc. in Atlanta, which manages $350 million and owns 190,000 Bank of
America shares. "You are going to see a plethora of banks fess up."</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America shares fell 19 cents to $70.11 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The shares have climbed 11% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Charlotte, N.C.-based company, the second-biggest arranger of
syndicated loans to U.S. companies, said the airline credits are
mostly leases and the fourth-quarter write-off also includes bad
loans to utility companies. The bank earlier wrote off bad loans to
companies that have filed for bankruptcy protection, including
Adelphia Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Among Bank of America's $125.9 billion in outstanding commercial
loans as of Sept. 30, $8.8 billion, the largest portion, was to
airlines and other companies in the transportation industry,
according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company
had an additional $4.3 billion in outstanding loans to utility
companies and $3.6 billion to telecommunications companies.</TE>

<HD>Wells REIT Buys Nestle Building in Glendale</HD>
<DH>Acquisition of the 20-story city landmark is part of the
Atlanta firm's plan to expand its presence in California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The headquarters building of Nestle USA Inc., a Glendale landmark,
has been acquired by an Atlanta-based real estate investment trust
for $157 million.</LD>
<LD>   Privately held Wells Real Estate Investment Trust bought the
20-story tower at 800 N. Brand Blvd. from Douglas Emmett, a Santa
Monica real estate investment and management firm.</LD>
<LD>   Emmett, one of the Southland's biggest office and residential
landlords, bought the building in 1995 for about $115 million. It was
built in 1990 to serve as headquarters for Carnation, then a Nestle
subsidiary. Nestle restructured twice in the early 1990s and took
over the building.</LD>
<TE>   Nestle's lease for almost the entire 505,000-square-foot building
lasts until 2010, according to CoStar Group, a real estate data
provider.</TE>
<TE>   "The Nestle building is considered one of the highest-quality
office properties in the entire Los Angeles area," said David
Steinwedell, Wells' chief investment officer.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition is the first of a planned series of transactions
to expand Wells' presence in California, where the company owns four
other buildings, Steinwedell said.</TE>
<TE>   Formed in 1998, Wells specializes in acquiring income-producing
office and industrial properties with long-term leases to Fortune
500-caliber tenants. Southern California holdings include the
Matsushita Avionics building in Lake Forest and the Quest Software
building in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The REIT is part of Wells Real Estate Funds, which has completed
29 transactions totaling more than $1.3 billion this year. Wells
manages $2.2 billion in assets for its three investment products, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   The Nestle building was designed by Los Angeles architects Johnson
Fain &amp; Pereira Associates, now known as Johnson Fain Partners. It
features marble, hardwood and brass trim and an outdoor plaza with
fountains, walkways and sculptures. It includes test kitchens for
product development and an eight-story parking garage.</TE>

<HD>Charter Replaces Two of Its Top Executives</HD>
<DH>The cable operator fires its COO and CFO in an attempt to
restore investor confidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charter Communications Inc., the nation's third-largest cable
operator, fired two top executives Monday in a bid to regain investor
confidence amid a federal probe into its accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis-based Charter, which is controlled by Microsoft Corp.
co-founder Paul Allen, issued a statement announcing that Chief
Operating Officer David Barford and Chief Financial Officer Kent
Kalkwarf would be replaced immediately. The company also said it
would lower its cash projections for the fourth quarter and adopt an
expanded code of conduct for its employees.</LD>
<LD>   Charter would not specify why Barford and Kalkwarf were fired, but
acknowledged in a statement that the action followed an internal
review of "various matters, including those relating to the
previously disclosed grand jury investigation."</LD>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors in Missouri launched a federal probe this year
into how Charter accounts for capital expenditures and subscribers.
One allegation is that Charter has kept nonpaying customers on its
books to inflate the number of subscriber counts -- a key gauge
investors and bankers use to value cable companies.</TE>
<TE>   Charter has 6.7 million customers nationwide, about 500,000 of
which are in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's firings were the latest shake-up at Charter. Nearly two
weeks ago, the company said it would eliminate a significant number
of jobs in a management restructuring designed to reverse heavy
subscriber losses and a crisis of confidence among investors spooked
by the federal probe.</TE>
<TE>   The developments also follow a wave of scandals that have shaken
corporate America and the cable industry this year.</TE>
<TE>   In July, cable pioneer John Rigas and two of his sons were
arrested and accused of looting Adelphia Communications Corp., the
nation's sixth-largest cable company and the largest provider in
Southern California. Among the allegations are that Rigas and former
Adelphia executives hid $2.3 billion in personal loans guaranteed by
the company and inflated corporate earnings and the number of cable
subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Charter has stressed that it was advised by the U.S. attorney's
office for the Eastern District of Missouri that none of its board
members, including Chief Executive Carl Vogel, is a target of the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We intend to take the appropriate corrective actions -- both
professionally and financially," Vogel said in the statement.</TE>
<TE>   Those actions, Charter said, include instituting a new corporate
compliance program, which involves appointing a corporate compliance
officer and adopting an expanded code of conduct to ensure that
"employees, from top-to-bottom, will adhere to the highest
standards."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were not surprised by the developments, saying Charter is
under pressure from investors to send a clear signal that it is
taking steps to restore confidence in the company, whose stock has
plummeted from a high of $17.05 a year ago to $1.17 on Monday, up 4
cents on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to make it very clear that they won't tolerate any
misrepresentation" of their accounts, said Larry Gerbrandt, chief
content officer of Kagan World Media, a Carmel-based research and
consulting firm. "Either you circle the wagons and everybody goes
down, or you say, 'OK, somebody's going to take the fall here.' "</TE>
<TE>   Barford, who has been COO since July 2000, was placed on paid
leave in October because of the investigation. Kalkwarf, a former
executive at Arthur Andersen, became CFO in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of the executives could be reached for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Barford will be replaced by Margaret Bellville, who joined Charter
this month as executive vice president of operations and is a veteran
of the cable industry. Kalkwarf will be replaced on an interim basis
by Steven Schumm, an executive vice president and the company's chief
administrative officer.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Charter said it expects fourth-quarter operating cash
flow to fall below previous forecasts. Operating cash flow excludes
depreciation, amortization and other items. Charter also said its
revenue growth rate would be close to its earlier target of 8% to 9%.</TE>
<TE>   The company said last month that it would restate two years of
results to incorporate more than $2 billion in costs and tax
liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Charter, like the cable industry as a whole, has been hurt by
heavy debts incurred to upgrade cable systems for new technology such
as video-on-demand. It also faces increasing competition from
satellite TV services such as Hughes Electronic Corp.'s DirecTV and
EchoStar Communications Corp.'s Dish Network.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup to Take $1.5-Billion Charge</HD>
<DH>The bank says it reserved the sum for loan losses,
regulatory settlements and lawsuits tied to its research practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Monique Wise</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc. said Monday that it set aside $1.5 billion this
quarter to settle claims that it misled customers with biased stock
research and to cover loan losses.</LD>
<LD>   The provision includes $200 million in additional reserves for bad
loans, a $400-million payment to settle regulatory investigations of
Wall Street conflicts of interest in stock research and funds for
related lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the charge, the world's largest financial services company
will still report 2002 net income that's greater than that of any
other company, U.S.-based or foreign, Chief Executive Sanford Weill
said.</LD>
<TE>   Citigroup is the first of several banks expected to reduce
earnings after Friday's announcement of a $1.4-billion settlement
between state and federal regulators and the 10 largest securities
firms over research conflicts. Concerns about regulatory
investigations and litigation have helped push Citigroup shares down
20% this year, the largest annual decline in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "The increase in the legal reserve should give investors some
solace that they're not going to have to think about this for a
while," said Steve Wharton, who helps manage $60 billion for Loomis
Sayles Inc. that includes Citigroup shares.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup faces at least 62 lawsuits tied to its research
practices, according to regulatory filings.</TE>
<TE>   The charge will reduce Citigroup's fourth-quarter earnings by 29
cents a share. On average, analysts had expected the bank to earn 75
cents a share, according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Strauss lowered his fourth- quarter
profit forecast for Citigroup to 45 cents a share from his previous
estimate of 74 cents. Strauss expects Citigroup to earn $2.61 a share
for 2002, or about $13.2 billion. The bank earned $14.1 billion in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   The write-off announcement ends a year in which Citigroup
confronted mounting loan losses in Argentina, the energy industry and
elsewhere, in addition to regulatory inquiries over its business with
Enron Corp. and into its stock research.</TE>
<TE>   The reserves may not ultimately be enough to cover the entire cost
of settling private litigation, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, Prudential Financial Inc., for example, ended up
paying about three times as much as it had estimated to settle
regulatory charges and investor lawsuits alleging that its Prudential
Securities Inc. brokerage subsidiary fraudulently sold $8 billion of
limited partnerships during the 1980s.</TE>

<HD>Errors Cut Enron Payments to Cal-ISO</HD>
<DH>Firm blames Computer Sciences data problems for
underpayment of as much as $50 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Douglass</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. said Monday that it underpaid the operator of
California's electricity grid by as much as $50 million because of
"meter-reading errors" by its contractor, Computer Sciences Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Enron disclosed the problem in a letter to the California
Independent System Operator, saying the errors date to July 2001. But
company spokesman Mark Palmer said that exactly what happened -- and
who would foot the bill for the underpayment -- could not immediately
be determined because the investigation began only recently.</LD>
<LD>   El Segundo-based Computer Sciences, which was hired as "meter data
management agent" for Enron's energy services and marketing units,
notified the company of the errors Nov. 20, according to the letter
written by Enron attorney Gary Fergus. The Houston-based energy firm
took a month to "verify the initial data and determine the types of
errors" before writing to Cal-ISO, Fergus said in the letter.</LD>
<TE>   Computer Sciences spokeswoman Janet Herin declined to elaborate on
the problems but said, "We found an error on our part, but how that
error occurred has to be looked into."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 1998, California's energy deregulation plan allowed
companies such as Enron to sell power to customers that had
traditionally purchased their electricity from municipal or
investor-owned utilities such as Edison International unit Southern
California Edison.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new system, Enron bought power through Cal-ISO and hired
an independent firm to collect meter-reading data, which were then
supplied to the company and to Cal-ISO. Cal-ISO utilized the data to
determine how much to bill Enron for use of the grid.</TE>
<TE>   According to Enron's letter Monday, Computer Sciences' mistakes
included not reading some customer meters and reading other meters
monthly instead of daily or even more frequently. Computer Sciences
also reported inconsistencies in data used for billing customers, the
letter said.</TE>
<TE>   "The range of speculation as to the magnitude of the underpayment
to the ISO is between $15 million and $50 million," Fergus wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg Fisher, spokesman for Cal-ISO, said the agency held
collateral from Enron that should cover any outstanding payments.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think that this is a huge problem, but we don't really
know," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear whether Enron will turn to its customers to
recoup the shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Among those that could be affected are the University of
California and California State University systems, which until early
this year had been jointly purchasing power from Enron for many of
their campuses.</TE>
<TE>   For the UC system, which had 1,500 accounts handled through
Computer Sciences, months would sometimes pass between billings, said
Maric Munn, associate director of energy and utility services for the
office of the UC president.</TE>
<TE>   "When we stopped getting bills, we had to hire an auditor to try
to sort it out and tell us how much we should have been paying," Munn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Munn said she believed individual campuses should have set aside
enough money to cover any underpayment.</TE>
<TE>   UC, under its joint deal with the Cal State system, bought about
$50 million of power a year from Enron, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron has not said what it would do to make up the underpayment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know whether we collected the right amount from customers
and then underpaid the ISO, or if we under-collected from the
customers and then underpaid the ISO," said Palmer, the Enron
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Fergus told Cal-ISO that an accurate accounting might
take four or five months, although Herin of Computer Sciences said
her company hoped to have a firm figure by mid-January.</TE>
<TE>   She added that the company believed the underpayment to be about
$9 million, well below Enron's estimate.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate development, J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., suing to
collect $1 billion from insurers to cover losses related to Enron's
bankruptcy filing last year, suffered a setback when a judge said a
bank e-mail referring to "disguised loans" may be read to a jury.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven insurance companies, including Chubb Corp. and CNA
Financial Corp., have argued at trial in New York that they agreed to
issue only surety bonds guaranteeing oil and gas trades and were
deceived because the transactions turned out to be loans.</TE>

<HD>Ernst &amp; Young, Two Law Firms Face $1-Billion Suit</HD>
<DH>Ten former clients accuse the accounting firm of getting
them to join illegal tax shelters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former clients have sued accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young and two law
firms for more than $1 billion for allegedly convincing them to enter
into illegal tax shelters, the law firm representing the plaintiffs
said in a statement Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit alleged that the firms convinced more than 50 clients
to enter into currency option trades to create paper capital losses
that offset real capital gains on which they would have had to pay
taxes, law firm Fensterstock &amp; Partners said.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, seeking $1 billion in punitive damages, was filed by 10
former clients in federal court in Manhattan on Friday against Ernst
&amp; Young and the law firms Jenkens &amp; Gilchrist and Sidley Austin Brown
&amp; Wood.</LD>
<TE>   The suit also alleged that against the wishes of its clients,
Ernst &amp; Young disclosed their names to the Internal Revenue Service,
which had served summonses on the firm seeking information about the
tax shelters.</TE>
<TE>   A plaintiffs' lawyer said his clients may owe millions of dollars
in back taxes to the IRS. He said he knows of no other case where the
beneficiaries of a tax shelter turned around and sued the accounting
firm and law firms that promoted the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first suit, I believe, of its kind -- allegations
that a major accounting firm, with a law firm, put together a canned
package of a tax shelter that they knew or should have known was a
sham," said lawyer Blair Fensterstock.</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young and Sidley Austin spokesmen were not immediately
available to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "While we have not had the opportunity to look at it thoroughly,
even at this stage it is obvious that it is without merit and we will
vigorously defend against it," Dallas-based Jenkens &amp; Gilchrist said
in a statement.</TE>

<HD>FAO May Close 70 Stores to Deal With Cash Crunch</HD>
<DH>Toy retailer receives more time from lenders to help it
deal with tightened borrowing restrictions. Company has said it may
file for Chapter 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Wiles</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FAO Inc., owner of the FAO Schwarz and Zany Brainy chains, said
Monday that it got more time from its lenders to negotiate new credit
terms and may close more than a quarter of its stores to ease a cash
crunch and avert possible bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The company and lenders, led by Wells Fargo Retail Finance,
reached an agreement that delays any action through Jan. 10, FAO
said.</LD>
<LD>   The retailer may shut as many as 70 stores, including about 55
Zany Brainy locations, by the end of March.</LD>
<TE>   The extension will allow FAO to work with its lenders and trade
suppliers to improve liquidity, the company said. On Dec. 17, FAO
said it might file for bankruptcy protection unless lenders eased
recently tightened borrowing restrictions. Budget- minded shoppers
have been paring spending on expensive toys at FAO, which has lost
money in each of the last eight years.</TE>
<TE>   About $1 million was available for borrowing as of Dec. 13, FAO
said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this
month. At that time, FAO said it would have been able to borrow $23.1
million without the bank's restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   The King of Prussia, Pa.-based company told analysts and investors
last week that the restrictions needed to be eased to avoid
disrupting payments to vendors and other creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Right Start bought FAO Schwarz in January and bankrupt Zany Brainy
in September 2001 and changed its name to FAO. FAO has combined some
functions to lower costs. The company has installed 98 Right Start
boutiques in Zany Brainy stores.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Zany Brainy stores to be closed were opened in 1999
and 2000 and weren't "economically viable," FAO said. FAO has 253
stores, including the flagship FAO Schwarz store on New York's Fifth
Avenue and 169 Zany Brainy locations.</TE>
<TE>   FAO rose to as much as 75 cents a share in after-hours trading on
Nasdaq. They fell 8 cents to 60 cents during the regular trading
session.</TE>

<HD>Global Criminal Case Closes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have decided not to file criminal
charges against Global Crossing Ltd., Chairman Gary Winnick or any of
its other executives over the company's aggressive accounting
practices or alleged document destruction, sources close to the
investigation said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles simply lacked enough
evidence to show that executives at the telecommunications company
had misallocated costs or had obstructed justice by shredding
sensitive documents, one source said.</LD>
<LD>   The decision closes the books on the U.S. attorney's probe into
the fiber-optic network builder, which rocketed to prominence under
Winnick and filed for bankruptcy in January under $12.4 billion in
debts and soft demand for its 100,000 miles of cable worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   "While there was a great deal of smoke, prosecutors obviously
concluded the evidence was not sufficient to bring a case," said
Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor in Newark, N.J., who has
tracked the Global Crossing situation. "These cases, from the outset,
are extremely difficult to make because they often fall into gray
areas where overt criminality is difficult to find."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Los
Angeles, nor Tisha Kresler, a Global Crossing spokeswoman, would
comment. Representatives for Winnick, a Los Angeles financier, could
not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   The end of the criminal investigation doesn't halt an inquiry by
the Securities and Exchange Commission or ongoing civil litigation by
investors.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't affect our case," said Sidney S. Liebesman, whose
Delaware law firm is lead counsel in about five dozen securities
fraud class actions that have been consolidated for trial in federal
court in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Claims that Global Crossing and its executives cooked the books
are at the heart of the civil cases and the SEC probe, according to
lawyers and court documents.</TE>
<TE>   In exchanging fiber-optic capacity with other telecommunications
firms, Global Crossing counted as revenue the capacity it sold to
others, but didn't list as an ordinary expense the cost of buying
capacity from others. The practice allowed the company to enhance its
financial results, which in turn helped boost its share price and
allowed executives such as Winnick to cash in stock options at high
prices. Winnick sold more than $575 million in Global stock.</TE>
<TE>   Such swaps have come under intense scrutiny in two congressional
hearings, and companies such as Global Crossing and Qwest
Communications International Inc. in Denver have had to restate
financial results and halt the bookkeeping practices.</TE>
<TE>   Swaps between Global and Qwest are part of separate SEC
investigations in Denver and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence in criminal cases has to prove guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt; civil cases require a lesser standard -- a
preponderance of the evidence -- to show liability. One source close
to the criminal probe said the evidence just didn't demonstrate
criminal culpability. The decision to close the case clears
"everybody of everything" in the criminal matter, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal investigation was launched on the strength of
allegations from Roy Olofson, a former Global Crossing vice president
of finance. He told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in
September that the company entered into more than a dozen deals in
early 2001 designed to overstate revenue and make the company appear
financially sound.</TE>
<TE>   Mintz said the decision not to prosecute does not necessarily
reflect on Olofson's credibility. Prosecutors need corroboration, he
said, and probably didn't find enough to support bringing charges.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of document shredding at five U.S. and Canadian offices
was always weak and was mostly resolved in Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   A shareholder in one of the civil fraud suits uncovered
allegations from two employees that they heard -- but never saw -- a
shredding machine operating behind a closed storage room door. The
company denied that any sensitive documents were destroyed at any of
its offices.</TE>
<TE>   For some former Global Crossing employees, the news that the
criminal case had come to a close was disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe this," said Paula J. Johnson of Colorado Springs,
Colo., who once worked as a senior manager of special services for
the company and lost $49,000 in retirement savings when Global
Crossing went under.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have liked nothing better," she said, "than to see
[Winnick] in leg chains and handcuffs being walked out of his home."</TE>

<HD>Gun Maker Smith &amp; Wesson Sets Sights on New Line of
Products: Golf Clubs</HD>
<DH>The deal is part of the 150-year-old firm's plan to tap its
'brand equity' to help it branch out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Frammolino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some dream of beating weapons into plowshares. But handgun maker
Smith &amp; Wesson Corp. has something else in mind: golf clubs.</LD>
<LD>   The Springfield, Mass.-based firearm maker said it would take aim
next year at the $1.3-billion golf club market by licensing its name
and logo on irons, woods, drivers and putters.</LD>
<LD>   The move is one of 30 such agreements the firm has struck over the
last several years to leverage "brand equity" and broaden the Smith &amp;
Wesson name beyond firearms. The company's most famous guns are its
patented .357 and .44 magnums.</LD>
<TE>   Under the deal, Smith &amp; Wesson will put its brand on clubs
designed and marketed by Vadersen Design Group, an established Ponte
Vedra, Fla., club maker. The clubs will be produced at undisclosed
factory operations under the supervision of Smith &amp; Wesson employees.</TE>
<TE>   The highly competitive club business is dominated by Southern
California companies, including market leader Callaway Golf Co. and
Taylor Made Golf Co., both based in Carlsbad. Firms as savvy as Nike
Inc. have found it difficult to get a foothold among finicky golfers,
who generally demand not just a strong brand name but something new
in the way of performance.</TE>
<TE>   To some, the gun maker's move onto the fairways and greens of
country club America initially has appeared, well, a little off
target.</TE>
<TE>   "It's odd. It's like Budweiser going into the doughnut business,"
said Mike May, spokesman for the Sporting Goods Manufacturing Assn.
"What's the connection?"</TE>
<TE>   Actually, a pretty good one, according to Smith &amp; Wesson
executives and Ernie Vadersen president of his namesake Florida
company.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Smith &amp; Wesson forged the club heads for Vadersen's
Snake Eyes brand of sand and lob wedges, which won an avid following
among golfers. Vadersen said he was so impressed with the
150-year-old firm's expertise in metallurgy, as well as its
commitment to making timely deliveries, that he eventually agreed to
a five-year licensing deal for the new clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that Smith &amp; Wesson is one of the great names in
American business, not just in guns and golf," Vadersen said.
"They're a solid group of people" with "a can-do attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Vadersen said he initially was concerned about the controversy
that has surrounded the company. Under siege from dozens of municipal
lawsuits, Smith &amp; Wesson agreed two years ago to change the way it
marketed and tracked firearm sales, triggering a backlash from gun
rights advocates who accused the company of selling out.</TE>
<TE>   But Vadersen came to believe that, even in the midst of the
brouhaha, most people had a positive impression of Smith &amp; Wesson:
"The quality overrode the controversy."</TE>
<TE>   The golf clubs will begin to hit pro shops and off-course
retailers early next year. Among the first to be released will be
three drivers and a series of fairway woods. Prices will range from
$150 for putters and wedges to $250 for drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Name and notoriety aside, experts say the test will be whether
Smith &amp; Wesson's clubs will be sufficiently different or better to
sway golfers, who are among the most fussy of sports equipment
shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   Nike, for instance, has been struggling to make a mark. Even after
it signed superstar Tiger Woods to an unprecedented endorsement deal
-- $100 million over five years -- Nike barely has made a dent in the
club market, according to golf industry figures. Callaway accounts
for an estimated 16% of the retail sales of irons, nearly 22% of
woods and almost 46% of all putters.</TE>
<TE>   At world-renowned Pebble Beach, golf pro John Mitchell said Smith
&amp; Wesson's reputation certainly "will intrigue some," but it will be
the products' performance that matters most.</TE>
<TE>   "They made guns for 150 years," said Mitchell. "If they can use
the metals to make a club that will outperform other clubs, that's
your ticket."</TE>
<TE>   John Steele, vice president of licensing and branding for Smith &amp;
Wesson Holding Corp., said Monday that the company believes there is
significant overlap between the people who golf and the people who

<HD>Kmart's Loss Widens on Discounts, Closures</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Kaiser</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Discount retailer Kmart Corp. on Monday reported a wider quarterly
loss after store closings cut into sales and it took steep discounts
in hopes of winning back customers it lost after filing for
bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   Company executives said the results met internal forecasts, and
they stood by a goal of emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection by summer.</LD>
<LD>   Kmart's bankers, suppliers and investors are watching results from
this holiday season closely as they try to gauge the retailer's
survival prospects in a fiercely competitive sector dominated by
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts expect Troy, Mich.-based Kmart to announce hundreds more
store closings early next year after it shut 283 this year. It now
runs more than 1,800 stores.</TE>
<TE>   Julian Day, president and chief operating officer, said Kmart was
analyzing its store base and would decide on further store closings
"once we're able to take stock of holiday performance," most likely
in January.</TE>
<TE>   The big question, analysts said, was whether vendors would extend
more credit next year if holiday sales slump.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Gottlieb, chairman of the bankruptcy group at law firm
Kronish Lieb Weiner &amp; Hellman, said unless Kmart posted a "total,
unmitigated disaster" in December sales, vendors probably would stand
by the retailer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you'll find creditors -- vendors in particular -- bending
over backward to try to help Kmart survive," he said. "Their choices
are, keep on shipping and hope for the best or force Kmart to
liquidate now. There aren't a lot of vendors who are going to force
them to liquidate because they will not be able to replace that
business."</TE>
<TE>   Kmart reported a loss of $383 million, or 76 cents a share, in its
fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 30, compared with a restated loss of
$249 million, or 50 cents, in the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said this month that it was restating financial results from
1999 to 2002 because of errors in how it recorded leases and payments
to vendors. As a result, it delayed filing its third-quarter report
with regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Day said the retailer would work on bolstering gross margins after
heavy markdowns squeezed them in the latest quarter. The gross margin
fell to 17% from 20.2%, largely because of clearance sales and
discounts aimed at bringing customers back into stores.</TE>

<HD>Ruling in Fraud Lawsuit Goes Against J.P. Morgan</HD>
<DH>Executive's e-mails telling of 'disguised loans' may be
presented as evidence, judge says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Vice Chairman Donald Layton's e-mails
describing prepaid transactions as "disguised loans" may be admitted
as evidence in a fraud trial, a judge ruled Monday in a blow to the
bank's case.</LD>
<LD>   J.P. Morgan has sued 11 insurers to force them to pay $1 billion
on six surety bonds backing oil and gas trades between Enron Corp.
and Mahonia Ltd., an offshore entity sponsored by the bank. The
insurers refused to pay after Enron's collapse, saying the bank
deceived them into backing loans, not commodity trades.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said the insurers may present
evidence of the e-mails, which the judge last week described as
"explosive." Rakoff turned aside the bank's bid to exclude the
e-mails and said they may be "highly probative" if the jury accepts
the insurers' interpretation of what they mean.</LD>
<TE>   "If the jury accepts defendants' view of what the e-mails are
referring to (as the jury reasonably might), the term 'disguised
loan' is highly relevant and precisely descriptive of what is
involved," Rakoff said in a 10-page ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The insurers in the case include units of Allianz AG Holding,
Chubb Corp., CNA Financial Corp. and Kemper Insurance Cos.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails at issue date from May 1999 and are a major part of
the insurers' case. In them, Layton discusses aspects of the bank's
derivatives and prepaid commodities transactions. Rakoff earlier said
the insurers could use them, only to reconsider last week.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan has denied wrongdoing in using Mahonia, saying it
properly employed the entity to help companies raise capital.</TE>

<HD>Stocks End Mixed on Disappointing Retail Reports</HD>
<DH>The Dow slips but the Nasdaq gains in quiet trading. Oil
surges $1.45 to $31.75 a barrel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks closed narrowly mixed in quiet pre-holiday trading Monday as
some mildly encouraging economic reports helped offset ongoing
disappointment over holiday retail sales.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup's announcement of a big earnings charge also held the
market back, but a rise in semiconductor shares lifted technology
stocks.</LD>
<LD>   In other trading, oil and gold prices resurged, with oil rising
almost 5% to nearly a two-year high on continuing worries about
Venezuelan supplies.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow industrials closed down 18.03 points, or 0.2%, at
8,493.29. That followed a gain of nearly 146 points on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 18.64 points, or 1.4%,
to 1,381.69. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 inched up 1.62 points, or
0.2%, to 897.38.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by 4 to 3 on Nasdaq and were about even on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Trading was light as mutual fund managers and traders left early
for the Christmas holiday. With Christmas and New Year's Day falling
on Wednesday this year, the holiday breaks are expected to cut
usually light year-end volume even more.</TE>
<TE>   Financial markets will close early today, with the NYSE and Nasdaq
closing at 10 a.m. PST.</TE>
<TE>   "Behind all this is very, very little volume," said Chris Wolfe,
chief equity strategist with the J.P. Morgan private bank.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfe and other analysts said those still in the market probably
were troubled by announcements from several retailers Monday that
holiday sales are continuing to fall short.</TE>
<TE>   "Retailers are getting slammed and they're getting slammed for a
reason," said Russ Koesterich, U.S. equity strategist at State Street
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Federated Department Stores fell $1.08 to $27.84 after the company
said its holiday season will lag its forecasts. Wal-Mart Stores
declined $1.20 to $49.59 after saying sales last week were at the low
end of its expectations. J.C. Penney, which also reported lackluster
sales growth, fell $1.49 to $22.33.</TE>
<TE>   Electronics retailer Tweeter Home Entertainment, the Nasdaq's
biggest loser, fell $2.64, or 33%, to $5.35 after warning that
quarterly profit will fall far below Wall Street estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Investors found limited reassurance in some mildly upbeat news
about consumer behavior and attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   Though holiday sales this month have been below expectations,
personal spending rose 0.5% in November -- the biggest gain in four
months -- on the strength of demand for cars and other big-ticket
items, the government said.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the University of Michigan reported that consumer
confidence edged up in December, matching estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela's stubborn general strike again rattled the nerves of
oil traders, pushing crude oil prices up $1.45 a barrel to $31.75 in
New York, the highest level since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In the gold market, jitters about Iraq and North Korea kept prices
near six-year highs. Gold closed at $345.10 an ounce, up $4.60, in
New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Citigroup fell 46 cents to $37.68 after the company said its
quarterly earnings would be reduced by $1.5 billion, in part to pay
for the costs of settling charges of biased stock research.</TE>
<TE>   * Chip-related stocks rose even though Cypress Semiconductor cut
its fourth-quarter sales forecast for the second time this month.
Cypress gained 30 cents to $5.60, while Novellus Systems added $1.31
to $29.89 and KLA-Tencor rose $1.29 to $37.49. The SOX index of chip
makers climbed 2.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Gold miners rallied anew. Goldcorp jumped 67 cents to $12.90; ASA
rose $2.09 to $40.80.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Quits Oakley Board as Firm Struggles to Rebound</HD>
<DH>Company is dealing with sluggish sales. The star will
continue to endorse its eyewear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Basketball star Michael Jordan resigned Monday as a director of
Oakley Inc., the maker of avant-garde sunglasses that's having its
own troubles getting the ball through the hoop.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan, who endorses Oakley's eyewear, said he quit because of
demands on his time and his desire to help Oakley increase the
independence of its six-member board, as proposed by new government
and market regulations. He was replaced by Lee Clow, chairman and
creative director of TBWA Worldwide, an advertising agency owned by
Omnicom Group Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan will continue to promote Oakley under an endorsement pact
that runs until 2005. And Oakley, based in Foothill Ranch, will need
his help.</LD>
<TE>   The company, led by eccentric founder and Chief Executive Jim
Jannard, is dealing yet again with slower sales growth. At a time
when retailers generally are grappling with the sluggish economy and
weak consumer spending, sales of Oakley's expensive sunglasses are
flagging.</TE>
<TE>   Twice in the last four months, Oakley has scaled back its sales
and earnings forecasts to reflect the trend.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to sell $150 to $200 sunglasses in this sort of
environment," said Mitch Kummetz, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan
Securities in Los Angeles. Kummetz cut his rating on Oakley to "hold"
two weeks ago after the company's latest cut in its forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley's stock, after peaking at $26.50 a share in mid-2001, has
plunged 60% since then. It closed Monday at $10.57 a share, up 19
cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   In its Dec. 5 forecast, Oakley said sunglass sales in the United
States and Europe were softer than expected. Also, Oakley's
deliveries of summer eyewear to retailers was delayed, lowering
retailers' reorders in advance of the current holiday season. Oakley
is trying to pare its reliance on sunglasses by diversifying into
shoes, apparel, watches and other accessories, but that effort isn't
yet making up the difference.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said this month that Foot Locker Inc. planned to
reduce the number of stores carrying Oakley's sunglasses and thus had
placed minimal orders in the current quarter as Foot Locker "reduces
inventory in preparation of this change."</TE>
<TE>   Oakley, whose glasses carry such names as X Metal and Frogskins,
also had a rift last year with its biggest eyewear customer, retail
chain Sunglass Hut, that badly disrupted Oakley's performance coming
into this year.</TE>
<TE>   Sunglass Hut unexpectedly slashed its orders for Oakley products
after the 1,900-store chain was acquired last year by an Oakley
rival, Italy's Luxottica Group, whose eyewear brands include Ray-Ban
and Anne Klein. Oakley moved to compensate by striking deals with
outlets such as Foot Locker. But in December 2001, Oakley and
Sunglass Hut renewed their relationship by signing a three-year
distribution pact.</TE>
<TE>   Through the first nine months of this year, Oakley's sales rose
14% from a year earlier to $387 million, while profit fell 15% to $40
million from $47 million.</TE>
<TE>   The sales gain came from higher prices, as unit sales of Oakley's
sunglasses were flat at 3.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Sunglasses account for 70% of Oakley's total sales, and 16% of
those eyewear sales are made to Sunglass Hut.</TE>

<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. won approval to sell

<LD>International Rectifier Corp., an El Segundo-based semiconductor
maker, said costs for job cuts, plant closings and write-downs will

<LD>   International Rectifier didn't say how many jobs were being cut
but said severance costs will be about $20 million to $25 million,

expenses. It said it expects the changes will save $80 million to $85
million a year.</LD>

<LD>The Treasury Department sold $14 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.185%, down from 1.2% last week. An additional $16
billion was sold in six-month bills at 1.24%, down from 1.26%.</LD>
<LD>   The three-month rate was the lowest since Aug. 4, 1958, when the
bills sold for 1.164%. The six-month rate was the lowest since Nov.
12, when the rate was 1.225%.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
-- 1.207% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,970, and 1.265% for a six-month bill selling for $9,937.30.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year, constant-maturity Treasury bills, the most popular
index for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 1.43%

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Arthur Andersen partner Robert A. Putnam was charged by the
U.S. with securities fraud for approving false financial reports that
led to $9 billion in investor losses at pharmaceuticals distributor
McKesson Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Putnam, 48, was the audit partner for HBO &amp; Co., which was
acquired by San Francisco-based McKesson for $13.9 billion in January
1999. Putnam's attorney said the charges filed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission were "overblown, abusive and without any basis."</LD>
<LD>   The SEC said Putnam knew HBOC's financial results were inflated by
inappropriate accounting methods that, when disclosed after the
merger, caused McKesson HBOC Inc., as it was known, to lose $9
billion in market value and its stock to fall 47%.</LD>
<TE>   Putnam is the 10th person to be charged by the SEC in connection
with HBOC. He faces suspension and loss of his auditing license. The
matter will be decided by an SEC administrative judge.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major league baseball is exploring whether to start its own
television channel to give it bargaining power in future negotiations
with Fox, ESPN and other networks, a league executive said.</LD>
<LD>   Last month in Dallas, the six-member board of Major League
Baseball Properties Inc. discussed starting a channel that might
begin broadcasting as early as the 2004 World Series, said Tim
Brosnan, an MLB executive vice president.</LD>
<LD>   "It's obligatory that we examine this option," Brosnan said. "Like
every good business, we're trying to plan for the future."</LD>
<TE>   Baseball's strategy follows that of other sports leagues. The
National Basketball Assn. already has a channel and earlier this
month, the National Football League said its channel would begin
airing on Hughes Electronics Corp.'s DirecTV next year. The channels
give the leagues an outlet to show games if they can't reach a
rights-fee agreement with networks.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Told to Carry Rival's Java Software</HD>
<DH>The ruling suggests Sun Microsystems has a good chance of
winning its $1-billion antitrust lawsuit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jube Shiver Jr.</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Handing Sun Microsystems Inc. a big victory, a federal judge in
Baltimore ruled Monday that archrival Microsoft Corp. must distribute
Sun's Java programming language with the ubiquitous Windows computer
operating system.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz said his decision to grant a
preliminary injunction was needed to roll back "market conditions in
which [Microsoft] is unfairly advantaged" over Sun, a Palo Alto-based
maker of computer servers and workstations.</LD>
<LD>   His ruling could cost the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant tens
of millions of dollars in repackaging and distribution costs.</LD>
<TE>   The decision means that Motz believes that Sun is likely to
prevail in its $1-billion antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, which
will go to trial sometime late next year. It also signals that Motz
is confident there is a substantial likelihood of irreparable
financial harm to Sun if Microsoft, whose Windows software controls
more than 90% of personal computers, does not distribute Java in the
meantime.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very gratified by the court's decision," said Sun special
counsel Michael H. Morris. It "is a huge victory for consumers who
will have the best, latest Java technology on their PCs, and it is a
victory for software developers who will write applications to run on
those PCs."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Microsoft said the company would appeal the
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed, but we are still reviewing the details of
the court's opinion," Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said.</TE>
<TE>   The case, filed this year, is one of four private antitrust
actions that are pending in federal court against the software
powerhouse, and it is the most sweeping in scope.</TE>
<TE>   Java is a general purpose computer programming language whose
small size and flexibility has made it popular on the Internet, where
it is used to power some pop-up Web ads as well as more sophisticated
computational applications.</TE>
<TE>   Sun's attorneys had argued that Java had been losing out to
Microsoft's .Net programming language, which provides a framework for
Web services such as electronic commerce, because Microsoft refused
to widely distribute the Sun software. The .Net language is designed
to function like Java but tie more Internet activities to
Microsoft-based servers. That could hurt Sun's hardware sales,
company executives maintain.</TE>
<TE>   But Microsoft's lawyers and the company's supporters argue that a
majority of the world's software developers already use Java, even
though the product has been faulted for not being as fast and robust
as some Microsoft offerings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this sets a terrible precedent when a judge says that a
competitor has to ship an inferior product," said Jonathan Zuck, head
of a Microsoft-backed trade group in Washington called the Assn. for
Competitive Technology.</TE>
<TE>   In his 42-page opinion, Motz said Sun "is entitled to the
presumption of irreparable harm and the protection against the harm
which a preliminary injunction affords."</TE>
<TE>   He added that if Microsoft should prevail in the marketplace, "it
should be because of .Net's superior qualities, not because Microsoft
leveraged its PC monopoly to create market conditions in which it is
unfairly advantaged."</TE>
<TE>   Sun's lawsuit follows a private antitrust suit filed in January by
AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Netscape subsidiary, which created the first
popular Web browser. Both legal challenges seek to capitalize on the
Justice Department's 1998 antitrust case against Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   As part of that case, a federal appeals court found that Microsoft
had leveraged its Windows monopoly to stifle Java and Netscape's Web
browser.</TE>
<TE>   At their peak in the mid- and late 1990s, the two products were
viewed as significant threats to Microsoft's dominance of desktop
computing software.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department's pursuit of Microsoft formally ended last
month, when U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly approved the
agency's settlement with the company after considering and rejecting
a request from several states to force Microsoft to bundle Java with
Windows.</TE>
<TE>   Since the government's antitrust lawsuit began in 1998, Microsoft
has successfully battled hundreds of private antitrust claims,
getting many of them thrown out of court on grounds that the
plaintiffs -- mostly consumers who bought Windows -- had no standing
to sue.</TE>
<TE>   But some legal experts say Motz's decision may be an indication
that the tide is turning against Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a significant victory for Sun," said Andy Gavil, an
antitrust expert and law professor at Howard University in
Washington. "The ruling does indicate some degree of conflict with
what Judge Kollar-Kotelly ruled" last month. The ruling, which was
announced after the markets closed, sent Sun shares up 31 cents, or
about 10%, in after-hours trading. They had closed at $2.96, down 5
cents, in regular Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares rose 96 cents to $54 in regular Nasdaq trading.
They dipped slightly before recovering in after-hours trading.</TE>

<HD>Game Publisher THQ Cuts Outlook on Slower Sales</HD>
<DH>The news surprises analysts and investors, given the
Calabasas firm's usual strength in the fourth quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Glenda McCarthy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calabasas video game publisher THQ Inc. slashed its fourth-quarter
and 2003 revenue and earnings forecasts Monday, another sign that
holiday sales of games are failing to live up to expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The news surprised both industry observers and investors, given
that the fourth quarter traditionally is the company's most vital,
last year having accounted for nearly half of annual sales and 75% of
profit. THQ shares traded as low as $9.50 on Nasdaq before recovering
to end the day at $12.22, off 9 cents.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities, was
taken aback by the magnitude of the revision, as THQ lowered its
sales projections by as much as 22%.</LD>
<TE>   The company and other, smaller rivals to industry giant
Electronics Arts Inc. are failing to get the unit sales they expected
because they are making too many games and retailers aren't ordering
the second-tier names, Pachter said.</TE>
<TE>   "The strategy of putting out more games isn't working," he said,
noting that THQ makes the same number of games as EA but is one-fifth
its size in terms of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Pachter reiterated his "buy" rating on THQ stock, up to
$18, because he expects earnings and revenue to improve and because
the company has ample cash. Pachter said he does not own any THQ
shares.</TE>
<TE>   A THQ spokesman said the company would not comment beyond a news
release disclosing the revision.</TE>
<TE>   In revising its forecast, THQ blamed lower-than-expected sales of
games for Nintendo Co.'s GameCube consoles and the "Red Faction II"
game made for Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 2, as well as retailers'
changing inventory strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Game industry analysts and executives have said retailers are
keeping initial orders of new games low to focus on the most popular
titles.</TE>
<TE>   THQ said sales in the three months ending Dec. 31 should come in
at $215 million to $220 million, or as much as 22% below previous
guidance of $270 million to $275 million. The company cut its profit
guidance by as much as 60%, to 40 cents to 43 cents a share, from the
previous range of 95 cents to $1.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts polled by Thomson First Call had projected, on average,
profit of 93 cents a share on revenue of $263.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company also announced fourth-quarter charges totaling $6.7
million, including $2 million for settling a 2-year-old shareholder
lawsuit. THQ said it tentatively agreed to pay $10.2 million to
settle the class-action suit, which claimed the company misled
investors. THQ said its insurance might not cover $5 million of the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding the charges, earnings will be 30 cents to 33 cents a
share for the quarter, THQ said.</TE>
<TE>   For all of 2002, THQ said it expected revenue of $478 million to
$483 million and earnings of 68 cents to 71 cents a share, excluding
charges. Analysts expected earnings of $1.06 a share on revenue of
$581 million.</TE>
<TE>   Looking to 2003, THQ said it expected a first-quarter loss of
about 15 cents a share on revenue of $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   That compares with a profit of 7 cents a share, on sales of $79.7
million in the first quarter this year.</TE>
<TE>   For all of 2003, THQ said it expected earnings of about 90 cents a
share on revenue of about $540 million.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were forecasting a loss of 11 cents on revenue of $54.6
million for the first quarter, and a full-year profit of $1.38 a
share on revenue of $581 million.</TE>

<HD>Yahoo to Buy Software Maker</HD>
<DH>The $235-million acquisition of Inktomi is expected to
increase the portal's search capabilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yahoo Inc. said Monday that it would pay $235 million to buy Internet
search-software maker Inktomi Corp., strengthening its position in
the growing Web search business.</LD>
<LD>   The cash deal of $1.65 a share valued Inktomi, a highflier during
the Internet boom, at a 41% premium to Friday's close but at less
than a third of its value at its 1998 initial public offering -- and
at a fraction of its peak share price of $241 in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   By acquiring Inktomi and its paid-search capabilities, which
generate advertising income, Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Yahoo also
lessens its reliance on Google, a privately held company that
provides search functions to Yahoo but also has positioned itself as
an up-and-coming competitor, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Foster City, Calif.-based Inktomi soared 43 cents, or
37%, to $1.60. Yahoo rose 65 cents, or 3.8%, to $17.73. Both trade on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The takeover announcement helped push other technology stocks
higher as it generated hope among investors for further consolidation
in software and other industries that have seen sales shrink in the
wake of the collapse of the Internet bubble.</TE>
<TE>   Inktomi's search business features a paid-inclusion model that
allows businesses to pay for a prominent listing in the results for
specific searches. This practice has surged in popularity this year
as a low-cost alternative to more expensive forms of Web advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "The paid-inclusion model is really icing on the cake. That alone
really justifies the price of the transaction," Yahoo Chief Financial
Officer Sue Decker said.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo said it expected the acquisition to increase its earnings
per share within a year of closing. The deal is expected to close in
the first quarter of 2003, subject to approval by regulators and
Inktomi stockholders.</TE>

<HD>Firing of Beloved Youth Director Angers Parents</HD>
<DH>Oxnard Boys &amp; Girls branch is closing for renovation, and
its chief loses his job after three decades at the club. Residents
fume.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 33 years, Ruben Herrera had quietly helped mold the lives of kids
at the bustling Boys &amp; Girls Club in downtown Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   Known to some as Grandpa Ruben, he was a second father to boys
whose dads disappeared long ago. He was the coach who taught girls
their first lessons on the basketball court.</LD>
<LD>   Then, without warning, his bosses recently told the 53-year-old
Herrera that the club was being renovated, and he had to go. Herrera,
the director of the 7th Street club, was given a few hours to hand
over his keys and clear his office, leaving the only job he'd held as
an adult.</LD>
<TE>   He and three other employees will be paid until Jan. 3 and can
reapply for their jobs when the club reopens, in perhaps a year,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still in shock," said the soft-spoken Herrera. "They say it's
OK to keep coaching as a volunteer, so I'll finish out the season.
They're like my kids. I can't give up on them just because I'm not
getting a paycheck."</TE>
<TE>   Earning about $33,000 a year, Herrera said the job was "never
about the money." He began at the Boys &amp; Girls Club as a 19-year-old
summer employee, but somewhere along the line he decided it was the
place he would retire.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he talks about unemployment benefits, and says he has no idea
where he'll work next.</TE>
<TE>   His employers are not talking about why they terminated Herrera so
abruptly, and he says he's too stunned to be angry. But plenty of
parents and children are furious. They're asking anyone in a position
of authority over the club to allow the coach to stay. They've gone
to City Hall, written letters to local state legislators, and his
teams are vowing not to play for anyone but Herrera.</TE>
<TE>   "He put his whole life into this and taught us so much," said
Andrea Covarrubias, 18, whom Herrera has coached since the first
grade. "Everything we have here is because of Ruben. It's just unfair
that you can do this to him after all he's put into this place."</TE>
<TE>   Boys &amp; Girls Club officials say the 50-year-old building on 7th
Street is run-down. They need to close it to begin renovating the
gymnasium, fixing bathrooms and leaks, and building a computer lab.
The children can go to two other nearby Boys &amp; Girls Clubs in Oxnard
and Port Hueneme while their facility is renovated, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The relocation is temporary, they say, and there are currently no
available staff positions to offer Herrera or the other 7th Street
employees.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the perception is that we wanted to fire a guy," said
Anthony Volante, vice president of the club's board of directors.
"That's not the case at all. I know it might not seem like it, but we
really just had no place for him."</TE>
<TE>   But parents aren't buying it. They say the staff's dismissal is a
sign that board members have no plans to reopen their children's home
away from home. They don't see how the board can raise the money --
up to $1 million -- it could cost to renovate the building by late
next year. But most of all, they can't imagine a 7th Street club
without Herrera.</TE>
<TE>   "They're telling us it's no big deal because we can go to another
club, but what they don't understand is that this is family here,"
said Anita Lemos, a preschool teacher who spent her childhood
afternoons at the club and now volunteers as a basketball coach.</TE>
<TE>   "He helped raise me," Lemos said. "You'll see people who grew up
here and now they have kids and they come back. It's because of
Ruben."</TE>
<TE>   Club officials said the decision to let Herrera go was difficult
but necessary in order to move the club forward. The renovations will
make it a club worthy of the more than 400 members who use it,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "One individual does not make an institution," said Tim Blaylock,
the club's chief operating officer for the Oxnard area. "This
organization is far greater than any one of us that work here. The
institution will survive."</TE>
<TE>   But the kids, and especially the parents whose trust Herrera has
earned through the years, disagree. They're considering pulling out
of the organization entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm torn," said Gina Acosta, a parent and volunteer coach. "What
lesson do I teach my daughter here? Do I pull her out of basketball,
which she loves, to prove a point, or what?"</TE>
<TE>   At the club recently, children and parents waited anxiously for
Herrera to show up for basketball practice. The slight man with white
hair did his best to give his last days some semblance of normalcy,
but the signs of change were already everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Herrera's office, normally wallpapered with pictures of children
at the club, at graduation or prom, had been stripped bare. The locks
had been changed.</TE>
<TE>   Parents clustered into circles and discussed what kind of a
going-away gift would be appropriate for the coach. Children glued
together sheets of paper to make Herrera a goodbye card. In bright
colors, they had written "Ruben," and signed their names.</TE>
<TE>   In his empty office, Herrera choked up just a little when asked
what parting words he will leave with his kids.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell them it was a privilege working with them," Herrera
said. "I probably got as much from them as they got from me."</TE>

<HD>Irvine to Have UC's First Computer Science School</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>University of California regents have created the system's first
computer science school at UC Irvine, elevating the profile of the
fast-growing department at the campus, which has long had a national
reputation in the field.</LD>
<LD>   The move, officials say, will enhance research and recruiting at
UCI's new School of Information and Computer Science, which was at
the forefront of the academic specialty when the department was
formed in 1968.</LD>
<LD>   It is also an acknowledgment of the growing importance of computer
science in daily life and the business world.</LD>
<TE>   "Computing is so pervasive in the instruction of all scientific
disciplines now," said Debra Richardson, the school's interim dean.
"It's clearly not a passing fad."</TE>
<TE>   Independent computer science schools are relatively new
nationwide, with the first ones having broken off from university
mathematics or engineering departments in the late 1980s, Richardson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at UCI's school are known for work ranging from
artificial intelligence and software technology to the cultural
impact of computing on society.</TE>
<TE>   Computer science is the fastest-growing major at UCI, where
enrollment increased 125% in the last four years, to 2,200 students.</TE>
<TE>   This year, UCI was ranked by U.S. News &amp; World Report in the top
15 public computer science graduate programs.</TE>

<HD>Slaying Victim a 'Devoted' Mother</HD>
<DH>'The children are devastated,' says the Lancaster woman's
mother-in-law. A neighbor is scheduled to be arraigned today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman found shot to death in a car driven by a neighbor was
remembered Monday as a devoted mother who had battled drug problems
but seemed to have put her life in order.</LD>
<LD>   Police and family members identified the woman as Jeanie
Waterson-Wheeler, a 44-year-old Lancaster woman who was found fatally
shot inside a car that crashed Sunday morning in a field at the
intersection of Alton Parkway and Sand Canyon Drive in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested David Rodgers, 37, of Lancaster on suspicion of
murder. Family members said Rodgers, a landscape worker at the mobile
home where Wheeler lived, was a close friend.</LD>
<TE>   Rodgers shot himself in the ankle during Sunday's incident and
held officers at bay for about 15 minutes, refusing to leave his car,
police said.</TE>

out.</TE>
<TE>   Rodgers, who worked at the Rancho Mirage Mobile Home Park where he
lived, was scheduled to be arraigned today in Newport Beach on a
murder charge.</TE>
<TE>   "The children are devastated," said Margaret Wheeler, the victim's
mother-in-law. "She was so devoted to them."</TE>
<TE>   She said Wheeler, her husband and their three children lived in
her three-bedroom mobile home.</TE>
<TE>   She said Wheeler left the home Sunday morning to go shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "When she didn't come home, I thought she was still doing
last-minute shopping, and I left to go to Apple Valley to pick up my
grandchildren," Margaret Wheeler said.</TE>
<TE>   She said her daughter-in-law had been in and out of drug
rehabilitation but seemed to be more stable of late.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a problem but went through rehab, and she was doing

<TE>   She said she had no idea how or why her daughter-in-law ended up
in Orange County.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Set to Pick Voting Machine</HD>
<DH>Registrar decides against a touch-screen system.
Supervisors must approve the selection, and some say officials pared
choices too soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's registrar of voters has selected an electronic voting
system to replace the aging punch-card machines that have caused a
number of recent election-night snafus.</LD>
<LD>   The registrar decided not to go with a popular touch-screen system
but selected a machine that uses a wheel that allows voters to
highlight selected candidates. The system will also allow the blind
and non-English speakers to vote without special assistance.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal goes to the Board of Supervisors in January and comes
amid growing criticism of the current system, which failed to tally
nearly 8,000 absentee ballots in the November election.</LD>
<TE>   "The system is getting old. It's hard to maintain. There's only
one printing plant that I know of that can print the ballots," said
Steve Rodermund, chief deputy registrar. "I don't like being put in
that position."</TE>
<TE>   Counties across the nation have been turning to electronic voting
machines since the presidential ballot controversy in Florida two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   By next year, analysts expect 75% of the nation's counties to have
some form of electronic voting in place.</TE>
<TE>   By the March 2004 primary, Orange County plans to place 9,000
electronic voting machines in the county's 1,700 polling places.</TE>
<TE>   The new system -- already used in parts of Texas, Virginia and
Colorado -- is expected to cost about $25 million. The county expects
to receive $16.8 million in state funds and $8.2 million in federal
money to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   Some county supervisors, however, question the registrar's
decision to whittle the choices without more advice from them. "It's
premature to narrow it down to one," said Cynthia Coad, outgoing
chairwoman.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson said through a spokeswoman: "In order to
make an informed decision, we're still waiting on some answers about
[the system's] performance and certification."</TE>
<TE>   Rodermund, who will become interim Registrar of Voters once
current Registrar Rosalyn Lever retires Dec. 31, said the board will
be briefed about the new system in January.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 28, the department will seek the board's permission to
enter negotiations with Maximus/Hart InterCivic, which makes the
voting system.</TE>
<TE>   If negotiations are successful, the board will be asked in late
February or early March to approve the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current voting system, county residents punch their
choices on a series of cards, which are hand-fed into machines --
some 3 decades old -- that count and tally the vote. This introduces
the possibility of human error, which county officials hope to
eliminate by moving to an electronic system.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed system allows voters to turn a dial to highlight
their selections on a computer screen. Ballots will be available in
English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese. Visually impaired
voters will be able to switch to a larger type, and the blind can use
an audio ballot to cast their votes.</TE>
<TE>   "It dramatically decreases human error, because with a punch-card
system, you've got a multitude of individuals that actually touch the
ballot somewhere along the process," Rodermund said. "With the new
system, there are very few times humans actually interface with the
system."</TE>
<TE>   Human error is what caused the registrar to miss nearly 8,000
absentee ballots last November. The office noticed the error weeks
later when it was about to ask the Board of Supervisors to certify
the election results.</TE>
<TE>   The ballots, from five cities, had been improperly fed into the
machine and were not added to the vote tallies. The additional votes
did not affect any elections, but it was another embarrassment for
the registrar's office.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has made a series of errors in recent years, including
providing incorrect sample ballots, ballots with missing information
and allowing shortages of Spanish-language ballots. Critics also
charged that some of the Vietnamese translations didn't make sense.</TE>
<TE>   Amin David, chairman of the Los Amigos of Orange County group, has
long criticized the registrar's efforts. On Monday, he was guardedly
optimistic about the proposed changes.</TE>
<TE>   "If the [new system] means an improvement, we applaud it. But
we're still very cautious as to the people that are in charge of that
office."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Coad added: "No matter what system we have, if we don't
have quality control, awful mistakes will still be made."</TE>
<TE>   The system selected by officials was one of three they tested at
locations across the county earlier this year. Rodermund said he
could not release details on the selection process until he briefs
the Board of Supervisors. During the testing, officials had said the
Maximus/Hart InterCivic was the cheapest of the systems examined.</TE>

<HD>You Better Believe Federal Faith-Based Funding Is a Bad
Idea</HD>
<DH>Government gets to decide what is or is not a religion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen McCarthy Brown</AU>
<BD>Karen McCarthy Brown is director of the Newark Project,
a mapping of religious life in Newark, N.J., and professor of
anthropology of religion at Drew University Graduate and Theological
Schools.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lots of people seem to think that federal funding for faith-based
charity violates the separation of church and state. It does.</LD>
<LD>   But there is another reason why Americans should be wary of
allowing the government to have any financial control over our richly
diverse religious traditions: Such funding allows the government to
decide, essentially, what counts as a religion.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush's recent executive orders facilitating the flow of
federal money to religion-based charities empower the government to
dictate which cultures will be central to our society and which will
be relegated to the social margins.</LD>
<TE>   For Bush, there is no confusion. "If a charity is helping the
needy," he said, "it should not matter if there is a rabbi on the
board or a cross or a crescent on the wall."</TE>
<TE>   So the president acknowledges Judaism, Christianity and Islam,
thus joining a new elitist consensus on the nature of religious
pluralism.</TE>
<TE>   This consensus reduces the plethora of religious traditions being
practiced in the nation to a meager three.</TE>
<TE>   How many people in the U.S. follow religious beliefs other than
those held by the "Big Three"?</TE>
<TE>   There are no precise numbers; it is difficult to say who "belongs"
to any religion that does not follow the congregational model.</TE>
<TE>   And estimates differ widely on many religions. For example,
Harvard University's Pluralism Project estimates that there are 2.45
million to 4 million Buddhists in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Yet too much attention to the wide diversity among religions in
this country would challenge long-standing Protestant hegemony,
including Bush's conservative version of it.</TE>
<TE>   So it is safe to assume that African-based religions such as
Santeria, Palo Monte, Vodou, Macumba, Candomble and Rastafarianism
will not receive one penny of Bush's faith-based initiative money,
even though hundreds of thousands of African Americans and Caribbean
immigrants in major cities throughout the country follow these
traditions.</TE>
<TE>   Hmong shamans won't get any federal money either; Cambodian and
Korean shamans would probably be written off as superstitious should
they try to apply.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose some segments of the Buddhist community could eventually
qualify, but the only ones that would succeed would be those that
have Americanized their religious practices so that they look like a
church with a countable congregation. I doubt that even the most
esteemed Zen roshi in the country could qualify for federal funding.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Mexicans make up the largest of the new immigrant
groups, the application process alone would effectively eliminate
indigenous religions from Mexico. Storefront operations need not
apply.</TE>
<TE>   The wave of immigration occasioned by new laws in the 1960s
brought new groups of people to the United States from Africa, Latin
America and the Caribbean, as well as several places in Asia. They
tend to be people of color, and most are poor.</TE>
<TE>   Among them are many whose faith-based charity will sustain their
families, friends and neighbors but will never be enhanced by federal
money.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has claimed that his government will respect the work of
"every faith-based group in America," but so many would be
unrecognizable as religious to him that it is difficult to know what
this promised respect is worth.</TE>
<TE>   It begins to look as if the faith-based initiative program is just
another way to ignore the poor and keep people of color in line.</TE>

<HD>INS Misses Mark in Nationwide Arrests</HD>
<DH>Rules seem to be guided by political concerns rather than
security needs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Niels W. Frenzen</AU>
<BD>Niels W. Frenzen is an assistant professor of law at
USC and director of the USC Immigration Clinic.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the last several weeks, Immigration and Naturalization Service
officials in Los Angeles and nationwide have been arresting hundreds
of men who have voluntarily appeared at local INS offices.</LD>
<LD>   The asserted authority for the arrests stems from recent Justice
Department regulations. Though how much the Constitution's equal
protection provisions refer to selective, nationality-based arrests
of noncitizens may be open to question, that there are some
protections is unequivocal.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice regulations require male citizens of some countries --
primarily from the Middle East, Near East and Africa -- who entered
the United States before Sept. 11, 2002, to appear at local INS
offices to be fingerprinted, photographed and questioned about their
activities in the United States. With the exception of North Korea,
all of the designated countries are predominantly Muslim. The
requirement applies only to men who traveled to the U.S. on
nonimmigrant visas, such as tourist or student visas.</LD>
<TE>   Who is subject to the special INS requirement seems to have been
guided more by political concerns than by concerns regarding how best
to assure national security.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Egyptians, the nationality of lead Sept. 11 hijacker
Mohamed Atta, are not required to report to INS offices. Citizens of
Kuwait, where U.S. troops preparing for a possible war with Iraq have
come under attack by locals, also are exempt. Citizens of Saudi
Arabia, which produced most of the Sept. 11 hijackers, were only
belatedly added to the list. Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are key
U.S. government allies.</TE>
<TE>   If we assume that the Justice Department requirements are to
protect national security, how can we reconcile the decisions to
exempt Egyptians and Kuwaitis and the attempt to conceal and delay
the inclusion of Saudi citizens?</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft says terrorist cells are present in the
U.S. and planning new attacks. Does the Justice Department have
information that Egyptians and Kuwaitis pose a lesser threat than
Iranians?</TE>
<TE>   And how can the exemption of French and British citizens be
justified? Does the Justice Department have information that French
citizen Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person whom the U.S. has
formally accused of being a Sept. 11 co-conspirator, or British
citizen Richard Reid, the failed airplane shoe bomber, are the only
European citizens who pose a threat to U.S. national security?</TE>
<TE>   The ineffective and chaotic manner in which the program is being
implemented is an indication that neither the Justice Department nor
the INS believes it to be important to national security.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the men arrested by the INS in Los Angeles have petitions
pending with the INS to legalize their status; these petitions
include their home addresses. If the INS had reason to believe that a
particular person posed some risk, officials could go to his home and
arrest him.</TE>
<TE>   Arresting these men as they voluntarily appear at INS offices
serves no purpose other than to spread more fear into the affected
communities. By not using discretion regarding whom to arrest, the
INS has wasted resources that should instead be used to identify
those who may actually pose a threat to public safety.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, Atta, Moussaoui and Reid would not be arrested under the
ridiculous and unfair guidelines that Justice and the INS are using.</TE>
<TE>   INS resources would better be focused on investigating and
identifying people whose actions or personal background might
threaten public safety. National security is not furthered by
assembly-line, nationality-based arrests and deportations.</TE>

<HD>Insurers Flip the 'Crisis' Switch</HD>
<DH>Like energy companies, they manufacture losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Harvey Rosenfield</AU>
<BD>Harvey Rosenfield is president of the Santa
Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. Web site:
www.consumerwatchdog.org.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like last year's energy debacle in California, the insurance crisis
now afflicting the nation is the product of artificial price and
supply manipulation compounded by grossly inadequate regulation.</LD>
<LD>   Insurance companies say soaring claims have made them lose
billions of dollars, necessitating premium hikes and forcing some
companies to leave the market. But these "losses" are invented.</LD>
<LD>   Flawed accounting practices permit insurers to make inflated
projections of future claims and then treat these phantom amounts as
losses for tax and regulatory purposes.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, on average, from 1996 through 2001, insurers nationwide
paid out only 66 cents in claims for every dollar they took in
homeowners insurance premiums. For medical malpractice coverage --
the spiraling cost of which has corralled the medical profession into
backing limits on victims' right to sue -- the figure is 69 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The mythical onslaught of "killer mold" in homes, along with such
real disasters as tornadoes and even 9/11, are merely excuses for
insurance company profiteering. As the chair of the nation's largest
business insurer told investors: "It's a field day for A.I.G., and
we're going to play the field."</TE>
<TE>   Independent examination of their books shows that some insurers
are hurting, but the culprit is not claims. It's the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, insurers sought to cash in on the boom. They
abandoned their conservative practice of investing in stable bonds.
The bear market cost property-casualty insurers $10.8 billion last
year. And they lost hundreds of millions of dollars in the stocks of
companies such as Enron and WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly stricken small investors and retirees now must work
harder or dig into savings. But the insurers can dig into our
pockets, raising premiums to cover their losses. That's why their
profits are up 66% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The current crisis is a repeat of the mid-1980s, when insurance
companies blamed a "litigation explosion" for skyrocketing premiums
and successfully lobbied for restrictions on lawsuits and jury awards
in all 50 states. But the huge losses projected by the insurers never
materialized. And, contrary to their promises, premiums never came
down after tort "reforms" were enacted.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, California is in far better shape than the rest
of the nation. In 1988, voters passed Proposition 103, imposing the
toughest regulation of insurance rates and practices in the nation.
Proposition 103 limits the expenses, projected claims and profits
that insurers can pass on to consumers and allows the public to
challenge insurers that cook their books.</TE>
<TE>   For example, when an insurance company recently requested a $2,000
increase in the annual premium it charges California doctors for
malpractice coverage, our organization challenged it.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than open its finances to independent scrutiny, the company
tried to withdraw its request. Physicians could save up to $18
million if our challenge is successful.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers are working hard to prevent California's success from
spreading. Even as they are pressing for higher premiums, the
companies are conniving to undo other states' regulation of their
excessive rates, arbitrary underwriting rules and unfair claims
practices.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners, made up of state
regulators but funded by insurance companies, recently endorsed an
industry plan to deregulate life insurers. It calls for the transfer
of all government authority -- executive, legislative and judicial --
from the states to a private national agency dominated by the
insurance industry.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush joined the insurers' campaign for deregulation when
he signed legislation requiring taxpayers to bail out insurers in the
event of another serious terrorist attack. Hidden in the new law is a
provision that strips state regulators of their authority to block
unjustified rate increases for terrorism insurance.</TE>
<TE>   California's experience is instructive for other states. In
California, deregulation of the state's electricity system,
championed by utility companies and ideologues, was a license to
steal $70 billion. By contrast, stringent, utility-style regulation
of the insurance industry has saved the state's consumers tens of
billions of dollars.</TE>

<HD>Is She Dr. Laura or Dr. Strange Love?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Scheer</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer is a syndicated columnist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some family values. Your 77-year-old mother lies dead and decomposing
for two months in a condominium not far from the radio complex where
you sternly hector millions about how to live a moral life while
attacking those who "deviate."</LD>
<LD>   And you never bothered once to inquire how your own mom was doing?
Maybe send a minion over to knock on the door once in a while? For
two months, the mail piled up, the condo fees went unpaid, and you,
successful syndicated radio advice guru "Dr. Laura" Schlessinger,
never noticed these and other worrying signs that, as the police
suggested, your mother may have been murdered?</LD>
<LD>   Of course, when you finally found out, after the building manager
called the police, you were "horrified by the tragic circumstances"
of her death.</LD>
<TE>   But was it really appropriate to add, self-servingly, that she
"died as she chose to live, alone and isolated." You said, "My mother
shut all her family out of her life over the years, though we made
several futile attempts to stay connected."</TE>
<TE>   Those are not kind words to speak of one's dead mother. Ties it
all in a neat little bow, doesn't it? Italian-born Yolanda
Schlessinger was "Sophia Loren-like," and you found her difficult. In
a 1998 interview, you claim a childhood "that would curl your hair."</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to reality: Good family values don't come easily. Problem
is, you've made it sound as if they do. You are one of the leading
conservative sloganeers who arrogantly claim a lock on the moral high
ground while deriding those, such as homosexuals, who dare to
"deviate" from your "norm." Using the title "doctor," earned in
physiology rather than medicine or psychology, has lent a false
credibility to your depictions of homosexuality as a "biological
error," a "dysfunction" and a "deviancy" -- words that encourage hate
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, honoring and caring for one's parents is at the heart of
your philosophy, as spelled out in your own presumptuous 1998 book,
"The 10 Commandments: The Significance of God's Laws in Everyday
Life." You wrote: "God's commandment of honoring parents is basically
the message that parents are a conduit of God. Any profanity or harm
to the parent is as if we've profaned God."</TE>
<TE>   You wrote, "By honoring our parents, we learn to honor God. By
honoring God we become decent human beings."</TE>
<TE>   You obviously failed that test. "Even bad parents deserve to be
honored if only at a minimal level," you wrote. Thus surely "honor
thy father and thy mother" intends something more than letting a
septuagenarian woman go months at a time without even a drive-by
visit from her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   You also wrote: "There is often a profound unwillingness to give
anything to a parent perceived as being unloving or undeserving....
That avoidance is part of the mentality that says, 'If it doesn't
obviously serve me, I won't do it and I shouldn't have to!' "
Apparently, that is your mentality.</TE>
<TE>   But you, whose shallow perceptions are laced with bursts of
meanness and contempt for others, will no doubt continue as a hot
media product and a darling of the religious conservatives. "A
positive voice for positive values without equal in our time," gushed
the Rev. Robert Schuller.</TE>
<TE>   What can we draw from all this? That family relationships are
exceedingly complicated and often painful. That maintaining true
"family values" is not a matter simply of attending church, being
heterosexual and mouthing platitudes, but demands humility,
resiliency and deep compassion. That religious texts like the Bible
can provide inspiring lessons in the hands of sincere teachers and
also can be used as clubs by the cynical and ambitious.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, that the "Dr. Laura" show typifies the dangerous
hypocrisy of those who build profitable and politically potent
empires on the basis of claiming a monopoly on simplistic answers to
complex problems. The guilt and shame they induce in those who might
resist their nostrums is loathsome, made more so when they themselves
so casually ignore them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On a Saturday in September, Maria gathered with her eight children,
ages 3 to 16, for their weekly meeting at a Hacienda Heights park.</LD>
<LD>   Today Maria was worried that her oldest daughter, Nan, had a
boyfriend. She scolded her, saying that 15 is too young for romance,
that she could get pregnant and ruin her life.</LD>
<LD>   She also scolded Nan's foster mom, with whom Los Angeles County's
Department of Children and Family Services had eventually placed the
girl and three of her siblings after Maria was hospitalized last
year.</LD>
<TE>   Getting together each week on neutral turf was supposed to help
the family move toward reunification. Maria says the meetings have
gone smoothly. "It gives me joy to see my children."</TE>
<TE>   But documents and interviews suggest that by last summer tension
increasingly undercut the gatherings, as Maria complained that the
foster moms were gossiping about her -- "talking chisme."</TE>
<TE>   So, when Nan muttered every teenager's mantra, I don't need to
listen to you, Maria ripped off a necklace and threw it. She hurled
her purse. Then she collapsed, sobbing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Plan for a Child</TE>
<TE>   It was a year ago, three weeks before Christmas, when Nan and her
siblings were taken in by the system that Los Angeles County
established to save children from the forces conspiring to keep them
from successful futures: abuse, neglect, abandonment and other forms
of absent or awful parenting.</TE>
<TE>   What Nan didn't know on the day social workers loaded the children
into the big white van was just how overwhelmed the agency that was
taking over their lives is -- and, as a result, how many of the young
people in the agency's care turn 18 with a lousy education, a dearth
of skills, no goals and nowhere to turn for help.</TE>
<TE>   In two years, for instance, Nan's oldest brother, Jorge, 16, will
reach adulthood. If the shy, beefy boy with spiky hair and a hint of
a mustache hasn't been returned to his mother or been adopted, the
agency will dump him as summarily as it did 1,400 young men and women
last year.</TE>
<TE>   About four in 10 newly minted products of Los Angeles County's
child welfare system drop out of high school, and an equal number
wind up on welfare. Fewer than three in 100 will earn a college
degree.</TE>
<TE>   Within two years, a third have their own children, and almost one
in five lands in jail. All too often, in other words, the system
saves children from rotten parents, only to create another generation
of rotten parents to continue packing foster homes with neglected,
abused and abandoned kids.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Plan for a County</TE>
<TE>   Several quick changes would give these teens a better shot at
doing well -- at becoming taxpayers rather than continuing to drain
other peoples' earnings.</TE>
<TE>   * For one thing, state law requires child welfare agencies to come
up with detailed plans to lead each teenager toward his or her goals:
passing algebra, say, if college is on the horizon, or learning job
skills. Most of the plans on file, however, are boilerplate that
swamped social workers have slapped together on the run. Limiting
caseloads will give workers the time to make these plans mean
something -- if their bosses encourage them.</TE>
<TE>   * Even with more hours, however, social workers can't do
everything -- which makes it vexing that agency administrators have
stubbornly resisted efforts to link foster teens with volunteer
mentors, such as the lawyers the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. has
recruited to help guide struggling youths.</TE>
<TE>   * For years, administrators were too disorganized to create more
transitional living centers or steer teens to existing ones, such as
the YWCA home in Santa Monica that six young women fresh out of
foster care are using as a springboard into adulthood. It's getting
better. About 1,000 teens take advantage of such programs. Space for
3,000 more is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Improving the agency's 11th-hour efforts to guide teens is
important. Even more important, however, is addressing the needs of
every child at every step. That will take several reforms:</TE>
<TE>   * Find the right director. The supervisors need to mount a search
that's as thorough as the dragnet Mayor James K. Hahn cast for a
police chief. The job is that important.</TE>
<TE>   * Save families worth saving. The supervisors should harangue
Washington, as hard as they have over health-care money, to cut the
red tape that keeps them from spending more of the millions in
federal dollars the county receives on preserving and reunifying
families -- a strategy that has proved economical in all but the most
intractable cases.</TE>
<TE>   Flexibility will encourage these additional reforms:</TE>
<TE>   * Streamline adoption. Social workers often don't start looking
for adoptive parents until the court legally severs a child's
parental ties. That can take years. So why did the department hire
someone to spur the process only to shove him aside a year later?
Insiders say it's because some top administrators are comfortable
with the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   * Replace easy-to-lose hard-copy files with "Internet-passports."
These would let authorized teachers and doctors read a child's
history online and enter their latest grades and tetanus shots. Gov.
Gray Davis signed a bill last year to test a Web-based passport and
threw in $3 million to make it happen. But the feds have a say in
this, too, and they've refused to give the OK. Start lobbying,
supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   * Stop hiding behind confidentiality. Children in public care have
a right to privacy. But the public has an obligation to scrutinize
the agency it pays to protect those children. In 2000, the Los
Angeles supervisors backed a bill to open most court proceedings
involving these children -- as is the case in 20 other states. The
department opposed it and the bill failed. A new one is needed.</TE>
<TE>   * Publicize opportunities for people to pitch in, such as by
contributing to a fund social workers now fill by throwing bake sales
and begging from corporations. This money sends kids to camp, buys
uniforms so they can play on a school team and addresses other needs
that would otherwise go unmet.</TE>
<TE>   Nan, for instance, needed a front tooth crowned. But Medi-Cal
covered only a silver tooth -- not something to encourage smiles from
a shy adolescent in a new school. When Nan's social worker appealed
to the fund, it came up with the $1,000 for an enamel crown. Send
checks to:</TE>
<TE>   The Children's Trust Fund, c/o the Department of Children and
Family Services, 425 Shatto Place, Los Angeles, CA 90020.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Family's Fate</TE>
<TE>   Maria's youngest children, Leticia, 3, and Armando, 5, spread out
black, zippered binders in the small, neat bedroom they share at
their Moreno Valley foster home. Chattering enthusiastically in
Spanish, they thumb past the paperwork that follows them -- school
and immunization records and the like -- to photographs. In one they
splash in a wading pool; in another they pose with towering dinosaurs
at a nearby amusement park.</TE>
<TE>   When asked by his foster father to name his siblings, Armando's
eyes roll to the ceiling and he faithfully recites: Jorge, Nan, Noe,
Marisol.... Asked about their mother, he and Leticia glance at their
foster mom and seem confused. It has been a year since they last
lived with the woman who gave birth to them.</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Maria says she is feeling better and that the return
of at least some of her children would make her feel better still.
"To be with my children, to take care of my children, I need that to
not get sick," she says.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 3, a judge at Los Angeles County's Edelman Children's
Court is scheduled to decide whether to return Leticia and her
siblings or sever their ties, leaving some in foster care or on track
for adoption.</TE>
<TE>   Sad as their situation is, these children are lucky. Their mom,
for all her problems, is not an addict or abusive. All appear to be
doing well in foster homes. But too many of the 50,000 children in
public care in Los Angeles remain caught between a bad family and a
fate that is potentially worse.</TE>
<TE>   Agencies nationwide wrestle with caring for the children of
parents who failed them. All but a few -- Florida comes to mind --
have, by every account, managed to put their houses in far better
order than Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The county's adults need to demand that their elected officials
hire an experienced, goal-oriented director and arm her or him with a
clear plan to achieve the reforms that will give a measure of hope
for happier endings to the boys and girls in the nation's largest
household.</TE>

<HD>A Sad and Silent Night for Bethlehem Residents</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Oh, Little Town Lies Still Indeed," Dec. 18: The streets and
Bethlehem churches may be silent for their Christmas services this
year, but what is more troubling is the silence of the Christians
throughout the world as the Israeli occupation further demoralizes
this pilgrimage site, the birthplace of Jesus Christ.</LD>
<LD>   Last month I was scheduled to teach a course at the Bethlehem
Bible College but, because of the 24-hour curfew, I taught in
relatively peaceful Gaza City. The folks in Gaza feel they are better
off than their fellow Palestinians in the West Bank. Although Israeli
U.S.-made helicopters regularly pound on suspected terrorists' homes,
and the small number of Israeli settlements constantly seize more
land for occupation, the Gazans have a steady United Nations supply
of food and enjoy a degree of freedom not found in Bethlehem and
other Palestinian towns under reoccupation.</LD>
<TE>   The majority of the people in the Palestinian territories are
Muslim, 99% in Gaza, and some have asked me why the Israeli military
keeps assaulting Bethlehem, whose Christian establishments are
dedicated to bringing pilgrims and peace to the historic birthplace
of our faith. This Christmastime's total curfew, like the siege of
the Nativity Church this year, is going to drive out more of the
businesses, empty more churches and reveal Ariel Sharon's
government's aggression toward Palestinians, even those who want to
coexist with the Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   David Bentley</TE>
<TE>   Duarte</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You rightly mention that "Bethlehem was once overwhelmingly
Christian; now its Christian inhabitants make up less than half the
population." Clearly, the population of the Arab Christians has been
constantly diminishing over the last 10 years -- since Yasser Arafat
and the Palestinian Authority have ruled the West Bank. The Times
should write an article on the fate of the Christian Arabs in the
West Bank and the atrocities done to them by the Palestinians. These
atrocities are not dissimilar to what has happened in other Arab
countries, such as the atrocities done to Christians in Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Fariba F. Ghodsian</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve seven years ago, just as the
Israeli Defense Forces pulled out. It was packed with people in a
most celebratory mood. I talked to many Palestinians who were hopeful
about the future. How is it that seven years later, the town is
reoccupied?</TE>
<TE>   Arafat was brought into the territories by Israel to build a
country that would live side by side with it in peace. Instead, he
chose to arm his territories to the teeth, incite hatred and violence
through speeches, media and, most heinously, schoolbooks for the
young, and line his pockets and those of his corrupt Palestinian
Authority with aid meant to better the lives of his people. I feel
bad for the Bethlehem hotel owner who has not one guest booked for
Christmas, but he and all of his Palestinian brethren need to place
the blame on their "elected" leader who has taken away their hopes of
a better life and led them down the path to disaster.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Halt to Ariz. Citizen Border Patrols Urged," Dec. 19: In
referring to citizen patrols trying to keep illegals from crossing
the border from Mexico into Arizona, Pamela Sutherland of the Arizona
Civil Liberties Union says that "we are a government of law. The
vigilantism and lawlessness they [citizen militias] represent cannot
be tolerated, and we won't let their behavior go unchecked." This
statement might make sense if it were being applied to the illegals,
but to condemn citizens who are peacefully trying to protect their
property from the illegals (who are by definition criminals) is
absurd.</LD>
<LD>   Our border with Mexico is a joke that, for some reason, our
government can't seem to control, and I applaud these private
citizens for their efforts to protect our sovereignty. California's
fiscal crisis was caused at least partly by the overwhelming drain
illegals place on our education and health-care systems. Anyone who
works to avoid these problems in another state is a benefit to us
all.</LD>

<LD>It's absolutely amazing that the designs for ground zero in New York

never killed on the site. Imagine building office space at Gettysburg
or the Normandy beachhead, or building a resort over the battleship
Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   I guess the only answer is that New York City and its business and
political leaders really are greedy and shallow and care about
business and money over lives and history.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps it's this generation of leaders -- a generation that seems
to believe that the only purpose of life is to acquire money, and
lots of it, without reflection. Future generations will judge them
harshly for their lack of insight into humanity.</LD>

<TE>   New York City should be careful in selecting a design for what
will replace the destroyed World Trade Center's twin towers. While
there should be a place for a quiet memorial in the new complex to
remember those slain, the entire New York skyline should not be a
monument to the success of terrorism. We have a culture that focuses
on the future, not the past. No one minds a small scar, but it should
not dominate the whole organism.</TE>

<LD>Re "Housing Project Receives Key Vote," Dec. 20: So the city and
county of Los Angeles want to file lawsuits against Ventura County
following its approval of the Ahmanson Ranch environmental study.
They claim to be concerned that the 3,050-home project will create
too much traffic, use too much water and cause other environmental
problems.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the L.A. County Board of Supervisors, in late 1998,
unanimously approved Newhall Ranch, the largest development in L.A.
County's history, with 22,000 homes, over the objections of Ventura
County and several environmental groups, which challenged the action
in court. The pot is once again calling the kettle black.</LD>

<LD>"Bush Has Presented No Evidence to Launch a War" (Dec. 20) contains
letters from the antiwar crowd and not one letter from the majority
who think that a war might be justified to prevent a madman from
creating nuclear blackmail, or worse. It's not up to President Bush
to prove that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, it's up to Saddam
Hussein to prove it doesn't.</LD>
<LD>   Is no one writing about the possibility that if we do overthrow
the Hussein regime there would be dancing in the streets of Baghdad,
like there was in Kabul this year, in Kuwait 10 years ago and in
Paris in 1945? Why do pacifists fail to understand the horrendous
bloody lessons of prior generations?</LD>
<LD>   War is never sought, but it's not always the wrong course of
action.</LD>
<TE>   Steven Rothenberg</TE>

<TE>   So, Bush is rattling the sabers again. This man, who was not
elected and who used family connections to get out of serving in
Vietnam, is pushing harder than ever to send us and the world into
war. This war against Iraq that Bush wants so badly has nothing to do
with freeing the Iraqi people, fighting terrorism, eliminating
weapons of mass destruction or solving the Mideast's problems. It is
about settling old scores, winning elections, forcing the world to
accept the U.S. as an absolute power and reaping oil profits.</TE>
<TE>   It is also a distraction, keeping our minds off the crashing
economy, corporate layoffs and payoffs, the lack of real progress
against terrorism, the decimation of our environmental laws, the loss
of our privacy and freedoms and retrenchment in our government by the
far right, with its anti-woman and racist agendas. An attack on Iraq
by the U.S. that is perceived as being without justification will
cause more terrorism.</TE>

<TE>   Surprise, surprise; the administration found the Iraq report
insufficient (Dec. 19). Wasn't that a given? Every year the U.S. is
missing enough equipment to supply a full battalion with small arms,
but Iraq -- a Third World country that has been bombed continuously
for the last 10 years -- can't find every nail and screw that the
U.S. government believes it has (because the U.S. sold Iraq those
nails and screws). Our double standard is just unbelievable.</TE>

<LD>The first budget cuts the governor and Legislature should make are to

<TE>   California is facing a terrible budget crunch, and poor families
and students of all ages are going to take it on the chin. When we go
looking for sources of tax revenue, what about the giant gobs of
money in the marijuana trade? So far only the police departments and
the prison unions are able to benefit financially from California's
biggest cash crop, yet they do this at taxpayer expense.</TE>
<TE>   The marijuana trade in California is more than big enough to pay
for the social costs of marijuana abuse and for the shortfalls in the
rest of our state budget. Why are we letting this vast source of
revenue go untaxed?</TE>

<LD>I can't agree with Roger Norton's implication that the Bataan Death
March (letter, Dec. 20) should somehow mitigate sympathy for those
interned at Manzanar. The difference, and it is a crucial one, is
that the perpetrators of the Bataan atrocity were Japanese soldiers.
The victims of internment were mostly American civilians.</LD>

<HD>Warwick Charlton, 84; Re-Created Mayflower Voyage to Thank
U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warwick Charlton, the British journalist and promoter who re-created
the Mayflower and repeated its 1620 journey to America to thank the
United States for its help during World War II, has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Charlton, who lived in a modest castle in Ringwood, Hampshire, in
England, where he was the town crier, died Dec. 10 of a heart attack
in Bournemouth, England.</LD>
<LD>   His wild idea came to him in the North African desert during World
War II.</LD>
<TE>   Already experienced in London's Fleet Street newspapers by the
time he enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers at age 19, Charlton served as
press officer to Britain's top soldier, Field Marshal Montgomery in
North Africa. The Americans, he observed, provided crucial support to
England and other Allies even before the United States formally
entered the war.</TE>
<TE>   A history buff, Charlton steeped himself in Mayflower lore when he
found a book on a troop ship home from Singapore titled, "Of Plymouth
Plantation 1620-1647," the journal of the American colony's first
governor, William Bradford.</TE>
<TE>   Why not, he dreamed, thank the Americans by re-creating the
sailing ship and the voyage that took 120 Pilgrims from Plymouth,
England, to religious freedom at Plymouth Rock, and then give the
Mayflower II to the United States as a museum?</TE>
<TE>   Not all of Charlton's ideas came to fruition -- he also wanted to
re-create Sir Francis Drake's Golden Hind and hand that one to
California in honor of Drake's touching down on the West Coast in
1579. Other unrealized Charlton schemes included an American theme
park about British history to be called "Merry England" and a museum
to explain the meaning of time.</TE>
<TE>   But the Mayflower II, difficult as it was, did get built, did sail
and gave Charlton his place in history.</TE>
<TE>   He began raising money and interest about 1948. It took nearly a
decade of pleading and hucksterism -- selling promotional rights to
the Mayflower moving company; exchanging more commercial sponsorship
for rope, sails and English white oak; and selling Mayflower stamps,
coins, ties and other souvenirs.</TE>
<TE>   Charlton also had to enlist cooperation from Plimoth Plantation,
the Pilgrim historic group on this side of the Atlantic, which wanted
to build its own Mayflower. A stickler for accuracy, Charlton
insisted on 17th-century tools and materials for the shipbuilders.</TE>
<TE>   The original estimated cost of about $280,000 doubled and rose
higher. Yet most of the bills were paid when the copy of the original
three-masted ship was completed in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   Charlton set sail -- his first sailing voyage -- with a crew of
33. For insurance, Charlton quipped, he took along the shipbuilder of
the 106.5-foot-long, top-heavy wooden vessel.</TE>
<TE>   After 57 days and one storm between the old Plymouth, England, and
the newer Plymouth, Mass., the Mayflower II arrived June 25, 1957, to
an enthusiastic reception including then-Vice President Richard M.
Nixon and Sen. John F. Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   The original Mayflower cargo ship was destroyed in 1624, only four
years after depositing its passengers. The Mayflower II has
dramatically illustrated history for about 30 million visitors to the
little ship anchored at Plymouth, Mass., for nearly half a century.
The ship remains seaworthy and still sails or gets tugged
occasionally to nearby ports for display.</TE>
<TE>   Charlton recorded his version of the 1957 Atlantic crossing in his
book "The Voyage of Mayflower II." Sponsored by the Mayflower moving
company, he spent three years lecturing about the trip in more than
40 states before returning to England.</TE>
<TE>   Born in London, the son of a journalist father and actress mother
who died when he was 13, Charlton edited papers for British troops
when he first entered the military. He was court-martialed but
exonerated for his exposes on such issues as low military pay and
poor-quality tobacco. His impudence got him transferred to India to
the staff of Lord Mountbatten.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his life, while promoting various projects, Charlton
continued writing -- he turned out three plays and several books in
addition to his work in newspaper, magazine and broadcast journalism.</TE>
<TE>   Charlton is survived by his wife of 33 years, Belinda; three sons;
four daughters; 18 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Ring Suspected of Passing Fake Money</HD>
<DH>Bogus $100 bills that may be from Colombia are showing up
at shops in three counties. At least two people have been arrested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Secret Service officials are investigating more than 50 cases in
Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties in which
counterfeit $100 bills were used to buy items ranging from fast food
to craft supplies.</LD>
<LD>   A majority of the cases have occurred in the last three weeks in
Ventura County, and targeted merchants included toy and clothing
stores, eateries and sports shops, authorities said. A large ring of
people is suspected of being involved.</LD>
<LD>   "Some of this happens every year about this time, because these
people like to take advantage of the holidays and the rush of
people," said Bill Giles, the acting agent-in-charge of the Secret
Service's Ventura County office.</LD>
<TE>   Giles said the fake money appears to have been produced by
counterfeiters in Colombia, because it looks and feels similar to
bogus cash manufactured there and circulated in California in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   County and federal authorities believe that some of the people who
are using the counterfeit bills live in the Central Coast area, and
others have come to California from South America to shop and spend
both real and fake money.</TE>
<TE>   The counterfeit bills have been printed on high-quality paper but
lack most security features and contain inaccuracies, including the
words "USA 100" on Benjamin Franklin's jacket instead of within the
numeral 100 in the bill's lower left corner.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara police, who are investigating at least four cases,
went door-to-door to merchants in that city last week, handing out
fliers on how to spot the fake bills.</TE>
<TE>   At least two arrests have been made in Ventura County, but Giles
and local law enforcement officials declined to discuss specifics of
those cases because of the ongoing investigation. Santa Barbara
police said they also have a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Secret Service agents in Bogota are working with Colombian
authorities to investigate the source of the bills.</TE>
<TE>   The number of cases in the area this holiday season is about the
same as in past seasons, Giles said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information or merchants who need help spotting
counterfeit bills are asked to call Santa Barbara Police Sgt. Dave
Whitham at 897-2300.</TE>

sculpture won't also be a memorial to their industry.</LD>
<LD>   Planned to stand nearly 10 feet tall, the bas-relief would form an
archway at Ventura Harbor Village, the mall of shops and restaurants
that rings the commercial docks.</LD>
<LD>   Ceramist Michel Petersen intends to cast the sculpture's figures
from working fishermen and hopes to have the work completed by
spring.</LD>
<TE>   Ventura County's commercial fishermen say these are uncertain
times for them. As they are enjoying a year of record catches, the
state is preparing to ban fishing in some of their honey holes around
the Channel Islands. Regulators set up the marine reserves to give a
wide variety of ocean species a chance to recover from over-fishing.
But the fishermen say the restrictions would devastate their
businesses and harm the area's economy.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Commercial Fishermen's Assn. has sued to block
the new regulations and is raising money for its legal fund. At the
same time the association is collecting for the memorial. About
$6,000 has been raised so far -- a little under half the sculpture's
projected cost.</TE>
<TE>   Such monuments are common features at harbors and ports along
California's coast. Fisherman Kip Whited said Ventura Harbor needed
its own to remind diners at its restaurants about the "unseen
industry" that delivers seafood to their plates, often in perilous
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't really think about us unless they want to beat up on
us," Whited said. "They don't really say a prayer for us fishermen
every night."</TE>
<TE>   Petersen, who works under the name "Michellino," has installed her
large ceramic sculptures of turtles, dolphins and other marine life
around the harbor village as its resident artist for four years. The
memorial is planned for a walkway between two restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   "I intuitively felt that an archway would be appropriate -- a
doorway, a passage way from one side to the other," Petersen said.
"We're remembering those who passed over."</TE>
<TE>   The project's organizers have identified about 15 fishermen who
have died on the water in the harbor's 50 years. But in order not to
exclude anyone, the memorial will not give particular prominence to
their names.</TE>
<TE>   For $200, anyone can add a name to the tiled seating at the
sculpture's base.</TE>
<TE>   Petersen expects her design to incorporate fishermen in slickers
and boots, tugging fishnets and crab pots. She has asked four
fishermen to submit to being cast in plaster.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted nets and I wanted men working," Petersen said. "I didn't
want it to be a heroic pose. I wanted it to show working people."</TE>
<TE>   Her boyfriend, Mike Moberg, is one of the models, as is Whited.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tribute to a way of life," Moberg said. "It at least
represents something that goes on in the harbor rather than the
yachting."</TE>
<TE>   A squid fisherman during the winter months, Moberg said he has
weathered some hairy days hauling 45-ton catches across the windy
channel from Santa Cruz Island to the dock.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen have drowned when shifting loads capsized their boats.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything can happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, three Vietnamese fishermen drowned when their rickety
boat sank off San Nicolas Island. In 1993, a shrimp trawler, the Vil
Vana, never returned to its slip.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Coast Guard investigated the mysterious
disappearance, relatives of the seven crew members suggested
scenarios that included government conspiracies and UFOs.</TE>
<TE>   Petersen and others wonder whether the memorial might be more than
a tribute to individuals. "It's a record of the present and the
past," she said. "And hopefully it will celebrate the future, but I
don't know."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Commercial Fishermen's Assn. welcomes
contributions to its memorial. Checks to VCCFA, indicating the money
is for the monument, can be sent to 3600 S. Harbor Blvd., Suite 240,
Oxnard, CA, 93035.</TE>

<HD>Religion's Back at Holiday Corner</HD>
<DH>Mission Viejo thinks it has solved the space-allotment
problem: a lottery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vivian LeTran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Religious holiday decorations that were banished a year ago from
their longtime home in Mission Viejo to a remote park have returned
this year to the bustling corner of Chrisanta Drive and La Paz Road,
restoring a 35-year-old tradition that many locals had feared would
fade.</LD>
<LD>   "The religious symbols have special meaning during the holidays,"
said city resident Thanh Thayer, 35, who visits the intersection
annually with her daughters to see the popular Nativity scene.</LD>
<LD>   Mission Viejo adopted a new policy this year to avoid legal
difficulties that could arise when the city has to choose which
religions should be represented in a limited public space.</LD>
<TE>   Under the new arrangement, representatives of any faith that want
to mount a display at the intersection, known as Four Corners, first
must apply by entering a lottery. The first eight names randomly
drawn by the city may display at Four Corners, while the remaining
applicants are offered spots at Florence Joyner Olympiad Park two
miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Only four faiths applied this year, so each had a spot at Four
Corners: a Catholic Nativity scene and displays representing
Protestant, Bahai and Jewish faiths.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on participation and the luck of the draw, the
traditional Nativity scene could be excluded from Four Corners next
year.</TE>
<TE>   The lottery system is appropriate to an increasingly diverse
community, said Mission Viejo City Manager Dan Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you can say the displays have changed with the changing
character of Mission Viejo. It's more representative of more groups
that want to be a part of the community," Joseph said.</TE>
<TE>   The new system was developed in response to a controversy. Last
year, six faiths -- including Muslim, Christian, Jewish and Buddhist
-- competed for space at the intersection, which traditionally
accommodated only two religious displays in addition to a Santa's
workshop and community Christmas tree.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing legal complications, the city prohibited religious
displays on that corner and moved them to a roomier -- though more
secluded -- spot at the park.</TE>
<TE>   The intersection itself was decorated with only secular displays,
including a Santa Claus, a winter scene and U.S. flags.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the controversy, the Mission Viejo Activities
Committee, which had run the displays for years, pulled out. "As we
got more requests for religious displays, we knew, inevitably, it
would be more of a public matter," said Don Asay, a longtime
volunteer and former committee president.</TE>
<TE>   By adopting the lottery and increasing the number of displays, the
city has restored some semblance of harmony for the seasonal exhibit,
many say.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the city's reached an amicable solution, but I hope this
issue comes to a rest," said Mission Viejo resident Hamid Bahadori,
42. Bahadori had threatened to sue last year if the city had chosen
which faiths would be represented.</TE>
<TE>   "If we want to celebrate our sense of community, than let's be as
inclusive of all religions as possible," Bahadori said.</TE>
<TE>   From the day after Thanksgiving to Christmas, at least 60
volunteers spend an average of 100 hours total putting up thousands
of holiday lights and handing out hundreds of cups of hot chocolate
at the intersection. Over the season, Santa listens to at least 150
children a week who wait two to three hours to whisper their wishes.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears everything now is harmonious," said Patti Kellems, a
decade-long volunteer for the committee.</TE>

<HD>George Weller, 95; Reporter Received Pulitzer in 1943</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Weller, 95, a former Chicago Daily News reporter who earned a
Pulitzer Prize for his graphic account of an emergency appendectomy
performed by a Navy pharmacist's mate in a submarine during World War
II, died Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Weller died of unspecified causes at his seaside villa near Rome,
where he had lived for 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Boston and educated at Harvard, Weller began his career at
the New York Times, but moved to the Chicago paper about 1939 and
became a war correspondent. He won the Pulitzer in Reporting in 1943
for his story about the sailor who used a medical manual to perform
impromptu surgery aboard the Seadragon on Sept. 11, 1942. The
operation chronicled by Weller became a segment in the late-1950s
syndicated TV series "The Silent Service."</LD>
<TE>   Weller spent most of his reporting years abroad, usually based in
Rome. In 1954, he won the George Polk Award, which is named after a
CBS reporter who was killed while covering the Greek Civil War.
Weller was a good friend of Polk and had served as best man at his
wedding.</TE>
<TE>   For a few years after World War II, Weller lived in the U.S.,
where he received a Neiman Fellowship at Harvard. In addition to news
stories, he wrote books and plays.</TE>
<TE>   He was president of the Foreign Press Assn. in Italy in 1954.</TE>

<HD>Virginia Binger, 86; 3M Co. Heiress, Philanthropist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Virginia McKnight Binger, 86, the heiress of a 3M Co. fortune who
built her family's charitable foundation into one of the most
influential grant-makers in Minnesota, died Sunday of undisclosed
causes at her home in Wayzata, Minn.</LD>
<LD>   Binger ran the McKnight Foundation, a private philanthropy that
has given away millions of dollars to numerous causes, primarily in
Minnesota.</LD>
<LD>   Her father, William L. McKnight, served 37 years as president or
chairman of the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. and started
the foundation in 1953. In 1974, four years before his death, he
turned it over to his daughter.</LD>
<TE>   During her 14-year tenure, assets grew from less than $8 million
to nearly $800 million, and the foundation donated $235 million.
Today, it ranks as the 24th-largest foundation in the United States
and funds programs such as scientific research, the arts and
low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   Binger, whose personal fortune was recently estimated by Forbes
magazine at $770 million, also made small grants, many to needy
people she read about in the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband, James H. Binger, the former chairman of
Honeywell Inc., owned an award-winning Florida racehorse farm,
started by her father; and five Broadway theaters, one of which is
named for her.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jose Hierro, 80, a poet who won the Cervantes Prize, the
Spanish-speaking world's highest literary award, died Saturday of
respiratory failure while writing in a Madrid coffee shop.</LD>
<LD>   Known for his gravelly voice, shaved head and terse language,
Hierro won the prize in 1998, when he published his "New York
Notebook." He also won Spain's National Poetry Award in 1999, the
same year he was elected to the Royal Spanish Academy, the official
watchdog of the Spanish language.</LD>
<LD>   Hierro's first poem, "A Bullet Killed Him," was published in 1937
during the Spanish Civil War. When fighting stopped in 1939 and
fascist forces loyal to Gen. Francisco Franco had overthrown the
government, Hierro was jailed for five years. His crime was providing
aid to Franco's prisoners during the war.</LD>
<TE>   The poet published his first book, "Earth Without Us," in the
1940s. He won his first prize, called the Adonais, for his poem
"Happiness" in 1947. He also earned the Prince of Asturias prize in
1981, the National Award of Spanish Letters in 1990 and the Queen
Sofia Spanish poetry award in 1995.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Yuan Shihai, 86, a former star of classical Peking opera, died of
undisclosed causes Dec. 11 in Beijing.</LD>
<LD>   Born in 1916, Yuan began studying the distinctive, high-pitched
Peking opera singing style when he was 8. He developed a singing
technique that bears his name, and sang into his late 70s. Until his
death, Yuan was deputy manager of the China Peking Opera Theater.</LD>
<LD>   He served as a delegate to China's legislature and to the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, a high-level government
advisory body.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly 1,000 mourners attended his memorial service Sunday at a
Beijing cemetery.</TE>

<HD>County Awaits Smallpox Vaccine for 1,500 Workers</HD>
<DH>Doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers, police and firefighters
are to be inoculated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl Kelley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County hopes to receive enough smallpox vaccine in the coming
weeks to inoculate 1,500 medical and emergency care workers,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The county is awaiting word from the national Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention on whether its full request for vaccine during
the first phase of distribution will be granted, said Dr. Robert
Levin, the county's public health officer.</LD>
<LD>   "We've asked for about 1,500 [doses]," Levin said, "but what the
CDC decides to give us may be significantly less than that. It's not
clear when we'll hear. But we're poised to act when we do."</LD>
<TE>   At the top of the county's list for vaccination are doctors,
nurses, ambulance drivers, firefighters and police officers -- those
who would respond first to a bioterrorist attack or treat the victims
of one.</TE>
<TE>   If the county receives less than its request, a plan is in place
to modify the list, Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at the point where it would take about 10 minutes," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The county has submitted its request to a state agency that will
forward it to the CDC along with those from every other California
county except Los Angeles County, which is submitting its own
request.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Health Services is requesting about 40,000
doses for areas outside of Los Angeles County, which is requesting
about 9,000.</TE>
<TE>   Levin said that while he could not give a firm timetable for
vaccinations to begin, all signs indicate that the CDC will act
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The smallpox virus, which is highly contagious, was eradicated
worldwide in the 1970s, but officials fear that vials of the virus
kept in storage in the former Soviet Union may have fallen into the
hands of terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The concern took on new urgency after last year's Sept. 11 attacks
and anthrax scares.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush recently signed off on a national immunization plan
for emergency workers, but advised against inoculations for the
average citizen at this point.</TE>
<TE>   National health officials have estimated that 500,000 health
workers would be vaccinated in the first round of inoculations. The
Pentagon has requested another 500,000 doses for its troops. A second
round of vaccinations in 2003 could reach 10 million people
nationwide, Levin said.</TE>

<HD>Charles Rosen, 85; Pioneer in Artificial-Intelligence
Research</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Woo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Rosen, whose pioneering work in artificial intelligence led
to the invention of "Shakey," the first mobile robot that could
reason about its actions, died of pneumonia Dec. 8 at his home in
Atherton, Calif. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Rosen, an electrical engineer whose wide-ranging interests
included agriculture and the chemistry of foods, was a co-founder of
Ridge Vineyards, a California winery credited with a major role in
the revival of zinfandels.</LD>
<LD>   His most memorable work in robotics took place at Stanford
Research Institute, now known as SRI International, a nonprofit
research and development company in Menlo Park, Calif.</LD>
<TE>   As the first director of SRI's Artificial Intelligence Center, he
oversaw the development in 1966 of Shakey, a robot equipped with a
television camera, range finder, bump detectors, and a clever
reasoning program that enabled it to plan and execute simple tasks
such as moving a box around a room.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first robot that had the ability to make plans and
perceive its environment," said Nils Nilsson, emeritus professor of
computer science at Stanford University, who was Rosen's project
manager on Shakey.</TE>
<TE>   Although conceived as a pure research project, Shakey incorporated
technologies that bred many practical applications still in use, from
driver navigation software used in Internet services such as Mapquest
to "machine vision" systems that enable a robot to inspect and move a
part on a factory assembly line.</TE>
<TE>   The Shakey project also benefited the U.S. space program,
providing the basis for much of the software that ran the Mars Rover
developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   "Charlie did not write the papers, but he was the visionary who
started all this. He assembled the team of creative people who
together invented this stuff," said Peter Hart, a protege of Rosen's
who is chairman and president of Ricoh Innovations Inc., a
subdivision of the Japanese electronics firm that focuses on
artificial intelligence and neural networks.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen was raised by his mother in what he often described as the
"red light district" of Montreal, Canada. Although his family was
poor, he read every book and magazine he could find about
electronics. He set up a laboratory above the candy store his mother
operated and with a friend used tin foil, pencil lead and scrap parts
to build crystal radios.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to afford college, he moved to the United States and worked
as a waiter in the Catskills. While waiting on tables, he met a
professor who told him about Cooper Union College, the private,
tuition-free school in New York City founded by a workingman's
wealthy son.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen earned a degree in electrical engineering at Cooper Union.
He later received a master's from McGill University in Montreal and a
doctorate from Syracuse University.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he returned to Canada to test planes for the
Royal Canadian Air Force. After the war, he was hired by General
Electric in Schenectady, N.Y., to manage a group working on
transistor devices. He co-authored an early textbook on transistors.</TE>
<TE>   During a trip west, he fell in love with California and moved his
family there when he found work at the Stanford Research Institute,
which was established in 1946 by a group of West Coast industrialists
in conjunction with Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen guided the institute's Artificial Intelligence Center to its
rank as one of the world's foremost AI laboratories. He was known for
his renaissance appetite for knowledge in diverse fields, from
physics and neurobiology to many branches of engineering -- a
wide-ranging intelligence that colleagues said fueled his creativity.</TE>
<TE>   He was not above playing the role of gremlin, donning an opera
cape and scampering about the room moving the objects Shakey was to
find in an attempt to foil the robot's exercises.</TE>
<TE>   He also was the type of person who could, with utmost confidence,
pose a seemingly unanswerable question, such as: If every person in
Los Angeles screamed at the top of his lungs for exactly one second,
would the total amount of energy emitted be enough to boil water for
a cup of tea?</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't have any idea what the answer was," Hart recalled,
"but Charlie, off the top of his head, could give you a ballpark
figure.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only invent with what's in your head. He had a head
crammed full of facts and figures from so many disciplines."</TE>
<TE>   In 1959, Rosen and three scientists from the Stanford group bought
investment property in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The land had old
grapevines, attractive to Rosen, who had made wine in his garage.</TE>
<TE>   Tending the vineyard became a weekend hobby for the scientists and
their families. It became more than a hobby after "people began
tasting the wine and saying, 'My god, this is fantastic,' " said his
son, Hal. The hobbyists began producing wine for sale in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the winery is known for its zinfandels and Cabernets, "most
of which are at the top of their class," according to Wine Spectator
senior editor James Laube's guide "California Wine."</TE>
<TE>   Rosen and his partners sold the winery in the 1980s to a Japanese
pharmaceutical conglomerate. But he continued to invent products and
businesses into his 80s.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, after leaving SRI, he co-founded Machine Intelligence
Corp., which specialized in making machines that could recognize
industrial parts as they moved along a conveyor belt.</TE>
<TE>   He also started a company that sold a mix for making pickles at
home. Two years ago, at age 83, he invented a device to dispense
inhaled drugs, a product of his frustration with the inhaler he used
to treat his emphysema. It was bought by another company and is in
development.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen's wife of 61 years, Blanche, died in June. In addition to
his son Hal, he is survived by another son, Steve of San Francisco;
daughters Naomi of Sonoma, Calif., and Sema of San Mateo, Calif.; and
five grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Beloved Club Chief's Firing Angers Parents</HD>
<DH>Oxnard Boys &amp; Girls director is out of a job after three
decades. Officials say the facility is being closed for renovation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 33 years, Ruben Herrera had quietly helped mold the lives of kids
at the bustling Boys &amp; Girls Club in downtown Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   Known to some as Grandpa Ruben, he was a second father to boys
whose dads disappeared long ago. He was the coach who taught girls
their first lessons on the basketball court.</LD>
<LD>   Then, without warning, his bosses recently told the 53-year-old
Herrera that the club was being renovated, and he had to go. Herrera,
the director of the 7th Street club, was given a few hours to hand
over his keys and clear his office, leaving the only job he'd held as
an adult.</LD>
<TE>   He and three other employees will be paid until Jan. 3 and can
reapply for their jobs when the club reopens, in perhaps a year,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still in shock," said the soft-spoken Herrera. "They say it's
OK to keep coaching as a volunteer, so I'll finish out the season.
They're like my kids. I can't give up on them just because I'm not
getting a paycheck."</TE>
<TE>   Earning about $33,000 a year, Herrera said the job was "never
about the money." He began at the Boys &amp; Girls Club as a 19-year-old
summer employee, but somewhere along the line he decided it was the
place he would retire.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he talks about unemployment benefits, and says he has no idea
where he'll work next.</TE>
<TE>   His employers are not talking about why they terminated Herrera so
abruptly, and he says he's too stunned to be angry. But plenty of
parents and children are furious. They're asking anyone in a position
of authority over the club to allow the coach to stay. They've gone
to City Hall, written letters to local state legislators, and his
teams are vowing not to play for anyone but Herrera.</TE>
<TE>   "He put his whole life into this and taught us so much," said
Andrea Covarrubias, 18, whom Herrera has coached since the first
grade. "Everything we have here is because of Ruben. It's just unfair
that you can do this to him after all he's put into this place."</TE>
<TE>   Boys &amp; Girls Club officials say the 50-year-old building on 7th
Street is run-down. They need to close it to begin renovating the
gymnasium, fixing bathrooms and leaks, and building a computer lab.
The children can go to two other nearby Boys &amp; Girls Clubs in Oxnard
and Port Hueneme while their facility is renovated, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The relocation is temporary, they say, and there are currently no
available staff positions to offer Herrera or the other 7th Street
employees.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the perception is that we wanted to fire a guy," said
Anthony Volante, vice president of the club's board of directors.
"That's not the case at all. I know it might not seem like it, but we
really just had no place for him."</TE>
<TE>   But parents aren't buying it. They say the staff's dismissal is a
sign that board members have no plans to reopen their children's home
away from home. They don't see how the board can raise the money --
up to $1 million -- it could cost to renovate the building by late
next year. But most of all, they can't imagine a 7th Street club
without Herrera.</TE>
<TE>   "They're telling us it's no big deal because we can go to another
club, but what they don't understand is that this is family here,"
said Anita Lemos, a preschool teacher who spent her childhood
afternoons at the club and now volunteers as a basketball coach.</TE>
<TE>   "He helped raise me," Lemos said. "You'll see people who grew up
here and now they have kids and they come back. It's because of
Ruben."</TE>
<TE>   Club officials said the decision to let Herrera go was difficult
but necessary in order to move the club forward. The renovations will
make it a club worthy of the more than 400 members who use it,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "One individual does not make an institution," said Tim Blaylock,
the club's chief operating officer for the Oxnard area. "This
organization is far greater than any one of us that work here. The
institution will survive."</TE>
<TE>   But the kids, and especially the parents whose trust Herrera has
earned through the years, disagree. They're considering pulling out
of the organization entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm torn," said Gina Acosta, a parent and volunteer coach. "What
lesson do I teach my daughter here? Do I pull her out of basketball,
which she loves, to prove a point, or what?"</TE>
<TE>   At the club recently, children and parents waited anxiously for
Herrera to show up for basketball practice. The slight man with white
hair did his best to give his last days some semblance of normalcy,
but the signs of change were already everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Herrera's office, normally wallpapered with pictures of children
at the club, at graduation or prom, had been stripped bare. The locks
had been changed.</TE>
<TE>   Parents clustered into circles and discussed what kind of a
going-away gift would be appropriate for the coach. Children glued
together sheets of paper to make Herrera a goodbye card. In bright
colors, they had written "Ruben," and signed their names.</TE>
<TE>   In his empty office, Herrera choked up just a little when asked
what parting words he will leave with his kids.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell them it was a privilege working with them," Herrera
said. "I probably got as much from them as they got from me."</TE>

<HD>Policy Could Increase Access to Wild Lands</HD>
<DH>Administration is willing to give disputed roads and paths
to state and local governments. The environment could suffer, critics
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Disputed roads and paths through wilderness areas could be made more
accessible to the public if state and local governments take
advantage of a new policy that the Bush administration is expected to
announce later this week, according to environmentalists and Interior
Department officials.</LD>
<LD>   The policy could permit traffic across disputed rights of way that
cross all kinds of federal lands -- from national parks to refuges
and forests.</LD>
<LD>   "The impact will be felt in numerous small property disputes
between state agencies and the federal government," said James
Hughes, deputy director of the Interior Department's Bureau of Land
Management.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll be able to resolve those without lengthy legal disputes or
congressional action."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups and their supporters in Congress say that the
new so-called "recordable disclaimer interest rule" could harm public
lands by opening the door for the Bush administration to transfer to
the states ownership of thousands of disputed rights of way.</TE>
<TE>   The result could be fewer protected wilderness areas and more
access for motorized vehicles, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The impact is expected to be greatest in Utah and Alaska, where
the states dispute thousands of miles of trails, animal tracks and
even former wagon routes.</TE>
<TE>   California could feel the impact of the rule too, because some
counties, such as San Bernardino, have already cleared the way to
claim the contested paths.</TE>
<TE>   "This will let the administration enter into closed-door
negotiations for paving our national parks, refuges and forests,"
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said. "It's another dilution of the
'public' part of 'public lands.' "</TE>
<TE>   Congressional Democrats and environmentalists criticized the
policy as the most recent of many actions by the administration to
cut back on environmental protections.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bush administration said its new policy is aimed at
avoiding costly bureaucratic red tape. "Our goal is to not spend a
lot of money adjudicating this or spend the Congress' time on what is
basically an administrative issue," said Hughes, the Interior
official.</TE>
<TE>   The critics said the administration was seeking a route to
reestablish Statute 2477, an 1866 law that allowed states to claim
rights of way across federal lands. Congress repealed that rule in
1976.</TE>
<TE>   A draft fact sheet explaining the administration's initiative
states that Statute 2477 right of way disputes can "without question"
be resolved through the new policy. However, the administration
argues that the new policy is crafted broadly enough that it does not
conflict with a moratorium on rules and regulations relating narrowly
to Statute 2477.</TE>
<TE>   Heidi McIntosh, conservation director for the Southern Utah
Wilderness Alliance, said the full impact of the new policy is "not
going to be apparent immediately."</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually, thousands of these so-called rights of way will be
given away," she said.</TE>
<TE>   This could end up making it harder for groups such as hers to
pressure Congress to designate remote areas as wilderness, she said.
Areas can be disqualified as wilderness if there is preexisting
development.</TE>
<TE>   She also said it could make it easier for off-road vehicle
enthusiasts to gain access to protected public lands. "There are a
variety of ways this statute could really wreak havoc on public lands
management and protections," McIntosh said.</TE>
<TE>   But Hughes said the environmentalists were painting a "worst-case
scenario" of the effects of the new policy.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're probably overstating the impact of the rule,"
Hughes said.</TE>

<HD>Battle Over Oil Drilling Expands to New Front With Forest
Proposal</HD>
<DH>A fight over leases in Los Padres, less publicized than
that over offshore rigs, pits federal agency against environmental
groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Overend</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>A fight over opening the Los Padres National Forest to oil and gas
development is expected to heat up in coming months, turning the
long-standing battle over oil drilling anywhere near this coastal
city into a two-front war.</LD>
<LD>   Even as they continue their highly publicized efforts to block
further drilling in the area's coastal waters, state environmental
groups and political leaders are gearing up for an escalation of the
less-publicized showdown over the future of local wilderness areas.</LD>
<LD>   The fight over oil and gas leases in large areas of Los Padres
pits the U.S. Forest Service against a coalition of environmental
groups, as well as California's U.S. senators, both Democrats, and
U.S. Rep. Lois Capps, a Santa Barbara Democrat.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to be an uphill fight for us," said Keith Hammond,
communications director for the California Wilderness Coalition,
which opposes the forest leases, as does the Sierra Club. "We have an
administration that wants this, and now we have a Republican
Congress."</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service has identified about 140,000 acres in southern
portions of the Los Padres forest as "high energy areas," Hammond
said. Current restrictions against road-building in the forests could
limit that area to 40,000 acres, he said. But ways also could be
found to bypass the current road-building bans.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole world knows about the offshore drilling issue in Santa
Barbara," Hammond said. "People in Santa Barbara County now see this
as a two-front war. But almost nobody else has even heard of the
forest plans."</TE>
<TE>   Among the earliest critics of the forest development proposal was
Capps , who wrote last January to voice her opposition, declaring:
"The U.S. Forest Service must not take this action." Los Padres
Supervisor Jeanine Derby responded in February, saying that federal
law dictates that the Forest Service should encourage development of
minerals on federal lands.</TE>
<TE>   There were more exchanges early in the year, with U.S. Sens.
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and U.S. Rep. Sam Farr (D-Carmel)
urging the Forest Service to put environmental interests above those
of the oil industry. They noted that there are 20 imperiled species
in the areas involved, including condors.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Forest Service proceeded with its own study,
concluding that environmental concerns could be satisfied while
opening new areas of the forest to oil and gas leases.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has requested additional
information, and will then have about four months to either endorse
or reject drilling plans.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer will be reintroducing a bill early in January to designate
permanent wilderness areas where roads could not be built to open up
oil fields, Hammond said.</TE>
<TE>   But that would not protect the entire forest: About 40,000 acres
are near existing roads.</TE>
<TE>   Capps said last week that she will fight any drilling plans, using
congressional power to deny funding if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Capps said she has qualms about the next moves in the battle,
because "there's a pattern of making decisions behind the scenes" in
the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   A White House spokesman, Ken Lisaius, responded that "the
president works with members of both parties in Congress on national
issues."</TE>
<TE>   Hammond said a lawsuit would be the final recourse by
environmental groups. But, he said, the Los Padres might get a
reprieve, because "oil companies aren't exactly beating down the door
to get in there."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Wilson, a spokesman for the 36-member Western States
Petroleum Assn., agreed with that assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "Any future interest by a company -- small, medium or large --
would be very cautious," Wilson said. "There would be no large-scale
drilling operations destroying the environment."</TE>
<TE>   While trying to build support to block the Forest Service
proposals, Capps and Boxer were also urging President Bush to drop
further appeals of a decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals affirming California's right to approve new oil and gas
exploration.</TE>
<TE>   They called on administration officials to assist in terminating
36 undeveloped oil leases along the state's Central Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "The people on the Central Coast have made it very clear that we
don't want any more oil drilling," Capps said.</TE>

<HD>Corner Popular for Holiday Displays Sees Light of Faith
Again</HD>
<DH>Mission Viejo allows religious exhibits to return, finding
a way to avert legal problems: Because space is limited, it holds a
lottery.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Religious holiday decorations that were banished a year ago from
their longtime home in Mission Viejo to a remote park have returned
this year to the bustling corner of Chrisanta Drive and La Paz Road,
restoring a 35-year-old tradition that many locals had feared would
fade.</LD>
<LD>   "The religious symbols have special meaning during the holidays,"
said city resident Thanh Thayer, 35, who visits the intersection
annually with her daughters to see the popular Nativity scene.</LD>
<LD>   Mission Viejo adopted a new policy this year to avoid legal
difficulties that could arise when the city has to choose which
religions should be represented in a limited public space.</LD>
<TE>   Under the new arrangement, representatives of any faith that want
to mount a display at the intersection, known as Four Corners, first
must apply by entering a lottery. The first eight names randomly
drawn by the city may display at Four Corners, while the remaining
applicants are offered spots at Florence Joyner Olympiad Park two
miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Only four faiths applied this year, so each had a spot at Four
Corners: a Catholic Nativity scene and displays representing
Protestant, Bahai and Jewish faiths.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on participation and the luck of the draw, the
traditional Nativity scene could be excluded from Four Corners next
year.</TE>
<TE>   The lottery system is appropriate to an increasingly diverse
community, said Mission Viejo City Manager Dan Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you can say the displays have changed with the changing
character of Mission Viejo. It's more representative of more groups
that want to be a part of the community," Joseph said.</TE>
<TE>   The new system was developed in response to a controversy. Last
year, six faiths -- including Muslim, Christian, Jewish and Buddhist
-- competed for space at the intersection, which traditionally
accommodated only two religious displays in addition to a Santa's
workshop and community Christmas tree.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing legal complications, the city prohibited religious
displays on that corner and moved them to a roomier -- though more
secluded -- spot at the park.</TE>
<TE>   The intersection itself was decorated with only secular displays,
including a Santa Claus, a winter scene and U.S. flags.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the controversy, the Mission Viejo Activities
Committee, which had run the displays for years, pulled out. "As we
got more requests for religious displays, we knew, inevitably, it
would be more of a public matter," said Don Asay, a longtime
volunteer and former committee president.</TE>
<TE>   By adopting the lottery and increasing the number of displays, the
city has restored some semblance of harmony for the seasonal exhibit,
many say.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the city's reached an amicable solution, but I hope this
issue comes to a rest," said Mission Viejo resident Hamid Bahadori,
42. Bahadori had threatened to sue last year if the city had chosen
which faiths would be represented.</TE>
<TE>   "If we want to celebrate our sense of community, than let's be as
inclusive of all religions as possible," Bahadori said.</TE>
<TE>   From the day after Thanksgiving to Christmas, at least 60
volunteers spend an average of 100 hours total putting up thousands
of holiday lights and handing out hundreds of cups of hot chocolate
at the intersection. Over the season, Santa listens to at least 150
children a week who wait two to three hours to whisper their wishes.</TE>

<HD>The Rise and Fall of a Charismatic Pastor</HD>
<DH>David Moore's church thrived under his teaching of moral
values. But some hot-tub photos led to his resignation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Deborah Sullivan Brennan</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>As senior pastor of Southwest Community Church, one of the largest
Christian churches in the Coachella Valley, David Moore offered a
blueprint for the moral life, schooling his congregation on such
topics as the value of marriage and commitment, and broadcasting
those messages to Christian radio audiences throughout the country.</LD>
<LD>   But his pastorate crumbled on what some see as the shaky
foundation of his own conduct, after nude photos of Moore, his wife
and a married female parishioner in a hot tub surfaced during the
woman's recent custody battle.</LD>
<LD>   Moore, 49, resigned as pastor in November, as parishioners took
sides, the church board disbanded and half the staff quit, although
many subsequently returned.</LD>
<TE>   "I grieve over this church and the pain I've brought the people of
Southwest by a few minutes in a spa three years ago," he apologized
in a written statement to parishioners. "A trust has been broken, and
that's my fault."</TE>
<TE>   Moore also left financial questions in the wake of his departure.
Both the church and an affiliated nonprofit organization are now
conducting audits, officials said, and Riverside County sheriff's
detectives are investigating documents from the ministries.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, whose mother died of cancer in early December, did not
answer phone calls. But in an e-mail interview, he denied any
personal or financial wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "I agreed to resign as the senior pastor of Southwest Community
Church because I thought it would be in the best interest of
Southwest, not because we have anything to hide," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Moore joined the church as pastor 14 years ago, leading what was
then a small congregation in Palm Desert through its expansion into a
$36-million complex on 42 acres in the adjacent city Indian Wells.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues describe Moore as a charismatic speaker who attracted
congregants with his knack for translating biblical verse into
tangible terms.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very entertaining speaker who can capture and maintain
your attention," Dan Perkins, an associate pastor at Southwest, said.
"People were drawn here because of Dave, and it helped all of our
ministries."</TE>
<TE>   The congregation grew to about 1,200 official members, with more
than 10 times that many on the church mailing list. As many as 3,500
parishioners sometimes attend services, Perkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Moore also broadcast his sermons on Christian radio stations in
major cities including Los Angeles, New York and Washington. He sold
cassettes and videotapes of his talks through a nonprofit called
Moore on Life.</TE>
<TE>   As No. 1 among its "top 10 resources," the company's Web site
lists Moore's "Love for a Lifetime" series, which includes tapes on
"How to Keep the Fire Burning" and "The Anatomy of an Affair." Moore
and his wife, Sonya, also taped a video describing their faith, love
and marriage.</TE>
<TE>   So parishioners were stunned when photos began circulating last
fall of the couple soaking nude in a hot tub along with a married
woman who is a member of the parish. A letter by Steve Highfill,
district superintendent of Southwest's denomination, the Evangelical
Free Church, states that the photos were taken three years ago by the
parishioner's husband.</TE>
<TE>   In court records of the couple's recent custody battle, the
husband, who is the president of a local development firm, alleged
that the photos portrayed an adulterous affair between his wife and
Moore.</TE>
<TE>   In another document, he stated that he and his wife had "indulged
in an improper adult-type relationship with another couple," adding:
"As to the pictures, all four of us took them -- it's no secret."</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail response to The Times, Moore described those
allegations as "serious, false accusations."</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad to consider the repercussions of an innocent
indiscretion related to some photographs taken three years ago," he
wrote. "We asked for God's forgiveness three years ago and agreed
that this would never happen again. After Sonya and her girlfriend
destroyed the pictures, it's unfortunate that someone made a secret
copy to bring sorrow and shame."</TE>
<TE>   Highfill also asserted that after discussions with Moore, his
board and multiple witnesses, "I remain satisfied that no credible
evidence of an adulterous relationship exists."</TE>
<TE>   But Highfill said that even in the absence of adultery, the photos
show Moore falling short of a pastor's responsibility to honor
marriage, and maintain self-control, respectability and discipline.
The photos, he said in an e-mail interview, "represented a
progression of compromises, and could not be dismissed as a few
minutes of indiscretion."</TE>
<TE>   Jerome Baggett, an assistant professor of sociology and religion
at the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley, said clergy members are
often highly respected "but we're also secular Americans, and
fairness trumps, and propriety trumps, and nobody is above the law
and the need to act in appropriate ways."</TE>
<TE>   Religious scholars said that while the hot tub photos depict a
consensual gathering among adults, they nonetheless represent an
abuse of pastoral power.</TE>
<TE>   "The pastor always has more power in relationships than
parishioners.... The pastor is always the one responsible for
maintaining boundaries," said the Rev. Joretta Marshall, academic
dean and professor of pastoral theology and care at Eden Theological
Seminary in St. Louis, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Since Moore's departure, most of the departed staff have returned,
including three associate pastors. The church is conducting an annual
audit. And a transition team of five evangelical church leaders will
help lead the church in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Although Moore on Life formerly aired over the national Christian
radio network of Salem Communications, the organization stopped the
program on Oct. 31, said Salem Vice President Roger Kemp. The Moore
on Life Web site announced that it will now air messages exclusively
over the Internet and also undergo an audit.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County sheriff's detectives are likely to take months
examining a box of documents regarding Moore's ministry, said
sheriff's spokeswoman Shelley Kennedy-Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Moore plans to undergo a process of "discipline and restoration"
under the guidance of church elders and pastors from the Evangelical
Free Church, which may eventually restore his ministerial
credentials, Highfill said.</TE>
<TE>   While some church members expressed outrage at Moore's conduct,
others viewed him as a fallible but gifted preacher worthy of a
second chance. Still others mourned the end of his ministry but
backed his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "He's drawn a lot of people to the church and is an inspiration,"
said Deanna Young, a Palm Desert resident and 11-year member of the
church.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, she said, she believes he resigned correctly after
failing the moral principles he preached.</TE>
<TE>   "He disqualified himself, and it's unfortunate, because a lot of
people are having to do a reassessment of what they were receiving
from the church and realizing that they can't look to a person, they
have to look to God."</TE>

<LD>A Sonoma County supervisor wants to cut back on new vineyards to
protect the county's dwindling redwood acreage.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Reilly, recently elected chairman of the state Coastal
Commission, is proposing new regulations that would prohibit
conversion of timberland to grapes in large tracts of the rural
countryside. The proposal would include protections in the county's
general plan.</LD>
<LD>   While oversight of timber harvests is largely a function of state
government, officials say county supervisors have some authority to
regulate converting timberland to other uses.</LD>

<LD>The mother of a seventh-grader is demanding the end of a sex
education program that promotes abstinence, because she says the
curriculum has a political agenda and provides graphic information
about abortions.</LD>
<LD>   Renee Walker sent letters last week to the Mount Diablo School
District and state Supt. Delaine Eastin to complain about the
eight-day CryBabies program being offered at her son's school. The
program is run by First Resort, a pregnancy counseling center with an
anti-abortion reputation.</LD>
<LD>   Walker said she was shocked when her son explained abortion at the
dinner table, and said she found an abortion pros and cons list in
her son's homework that listed "killing a baby" as a disadvantage to
abortion.</LD>

<HD>State Deficit May Close 'Biomass' Power Plants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some small power plants that burn agricultural waste and rely on
state subsidies may close next year owing to state budget cuts.</LD>
<LD>   Called biomass plants, they make electricity by burning orchard or
vine prunings. They produce 95% less pollution than open-field fires
in the San Joaquin Valley, which is among the dirtiest air basins in
the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Area air regulators say biomass plants prevent seven tons of
particle pollution from getting into the valley's air each day. The
dust and soot particles are linked to increased mortality rates and
lung disease.</LD>
<TE>   But state budget cutbacks and unsuccessful biomass bids for
electricity contracts may put the plants out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis has proposed eliminating $4 million from a fund
set aside for biomass operators. The cut is part of the $10.2-billion
package of midyear cuts he is pushing the Legislature to adopt to
make up for a projected $34.8-billion shortfall.</TE>

<LD>Health-care workers here will be asked to vote this week on a
contract that will give them wage increases and influence over their
working environment.</LD>
<LD>   The vote, scheduled for Thursday and Friday, will mark the end of
a labor dispute involving workers at Bay Area hospitals and more than
a year of negotiations, including two strikes.</LD>
<LD>   Service Employees International Union Local 250, which represents
nurse assistants, pharmacy technicians, food service workers,
housekeepers and other employees at San Jose Medical Center, Good
Samaritan Hospital and Regional Medical Center, said Sunday it had

<LD>After a brief flight of freedom, a prized bald eagle from the San
Francisco Zoo was recovered safely from a mountaintop a few miles
from home.</LD>
<LD>   The bird, a 13-year-old bald eagle named Sequoia, had been missing
since Sunday afternoon, when she flew the coop from her handlers
during a routine stretch of her wings. Her "absent without leave"
status had zoo officials concerned, though they were able to follow
her movements with a radio tracking device attached to her tail.</LD>
<LD>   Sequoia wouldn't have been able to survive for long in the
wilderness, according to zoo spokeswoman Nancy Chan.</LD>

<HD>Election Official Selects Voting Machine</HD>
<DH>Orange County registrar decides against touch screen.
Supervisors must still OK the choice, which critics say was made too
quickly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's registrar of voters has selected an electronic voting
system to replace the aging punch-card machines that have caused a
number of recent election-night snafus.</LD>
<LD>   The registrar decided not to go with a popular touch-screen system
but selected a machine that uses a wheel that allows voters to
highlight selected candidates. The system will also allow the blind
and non-English speakers to vote without special assistance.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal goes to the Board of Supervisors in January and comes
amid growing criticism of the current system, which failed to tally
nearly 8,000 absentee ballots in the November election.</LD>
<TE>   "The system is getting old. It's hard to maintain. There's only
one printing plant that I know of that can print the ballots," said
Steve Rodermund, chief deputy registrar.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like being put in that position."</TE>
<TE>   Counties across the nation have been turning to electronic voting
machines since the presidential ballot controversy in Florida two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   By next year, analysts expect 75% of the nation's counties to have
some form of electronic voting in place.</TE>
<TE>   By the March 2004 primary, Orange County plans to place 9,000
electronic voting machines in the county's 1,700 polling places.</TE>
<TE>   The new system -- already used in parts of Texas, Virginia and
Colorado -- is expected to cost about $25 million. The county expects
to receive $16.8 million in state funds and $8.2 million in federal
money to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   Some county supervisors, however, question the registrar's
decision to whittle the choices without more advice from them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's premature to narrow it down to one," said Cynthia Coad,
outgoing chairwoman.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson said through a spokeswoman: "In order to
make an informed decision, we're still waiting on some answers about
[the system's] performance and certification."</TE>
<TE>   Rodermund, who will become interim Registrar of Voters once
current Registrar Rosalyn Lever retires Dec. 31, said the board will
be briefed about the new system in January.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 28, the department will seek the board's permission to
enter negotiations with Maximus/Hart InterCivic, which makes the
voting system.</TE>
<TE>   If negotiations are successful, the board will be asked in late
February or early March to approve the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current voting system, county residents punch their
choices on a series of cards, which are hand-fed into machines --
some 3 decades old -- that count and tally the vote. This introduces
the possibility of human error, which county officials hope to
eliminate by moving to an electronic voting system.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Hires Lobbyist to Help Get U.S. Funds</HD>
<DH>Mayor also meets with members of Congress to improve the
city's efforts in gaining federal help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Criticized during the secession debate for Los Angeles' poor record
of getting help from Washington and Sacramento, Mayor James K. Hahn
is moving to boost the city's clout by hiring a prominent lobbyist in
the nation's capital and rallying the area's legislators to begin
acting more as a team.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn is putting together a $228,000 annual contract with the
high-powered DC lobbyist/law firm Patton Boggs and met this week with
seven members of the city's congressional delegation to better
coordinate the city's pitch for more money from the federal
government.</LD>
<LD>   "We are bringing on some lobbying help in Washington so we get our
fair share back there," Hahn told 70 San Fernando Valley secession
activists at a meeting last week in Encino.</LD>
<TE>   The mayor also addressed concerns that the city's state and
federal legislative delegations are not effectively working together
to bring the city help.</TE>
<TE>   "During the campaign, the mayor was saying we should stay together
because Los Angeles has more clout in Washington if it is a larger
city," said David Hernandez, a secession leader. "But what we saw was
other, smaller cities were getting more grants. The city
representatives were not paying attention to Los Angeles' needs."</TE>
<TE>   A study last summer by the Rose Institute of State and Local
Government in Claremont found that Los Angeles ranked 38th among the
88 cities in Los Angeles County in per capita state funding, and
eighth for federal funding.</TE>
<TE>   "The city, relative to its size, has been particularly ineffective
in influencing its congressional delegation and its state legislative
delegation," said Steven B. Frates, author of the study. Frates said
a lack of coordination is just one factor. He said the local members
of Congress who are most influential, notably Reps. Howard Berman and
Henry Waxman, both Democrats, "have not particularly cared about the
city. They have cared more about national issues."</TE>
<TE>   Berman, who was one of the members of Congress who met with Hahn,
disagreed and said he is very active in looking out for Los Angeles.
He said he does not believe that there is a lack of coordination
among the city's representatives in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, the biggest concern hasn't been coordination. It's getting
the data to support our efforts in Washington from the city," Berman
said.</TE>
<TE>   To persuade the Bush administration to increase federal funding
for police officers, Berman said, the city needs to supply him with
data showing how the LAPD has declined in numbers and diverted
resources to the anti-terrorism fight.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's effort to bring the congressional delegation together was
widely praised, but there were signs that the mayor has his work cut
out for him.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn invited the 14 members of Congress who represent parts of Los
Angeles to meet in his office last Thursday to discuss how they can
help combat the city's escalating gang violence. Despite widespread
news coverage and public proclamations about a spate of gang
shootings, only six showed up.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn met with Democratic Reps. Xavier Becerra, Maxine Waters,
Juanita Millender-McDonald, Lucille Roybal-Allard, Diane Watson and
Berman to ask them to press for more federal funds for law
enforcement programs. Hahn met separately with U.S. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) on the same issue and plans to follow up the
sessions with a January trip to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   All the representatives who attended Thursday's meeting pledged
their support.</TE>
<TE>   "Every member of Congress we met with today hears over and over
again the problems of violence in their districts, and they are
working very tirelessly to see that we are doing something positive,
that we are part of a coordinated approach to make that happen," Hahn
said after the meeting at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Roybal-Allard said Democratic lawmakers do a pretty good job of
working as a team for Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk a lot," she said, noting that Democratic members of
Congress from California or their representatives meet every
Wednesday to discuss issues of common interest to the state. City
issues frequently come up at those sessions, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The hiring of Patton Boggs could help the Democratic Mayor Hahn
make some headway with Republicans in Congress. "They have good
connections with the Republican side of the house, which is a pretty
good-sized side right now," said Ron Deaton, Los Angeles' chief
legislative analyst.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has begun working with the three city employees who lobby
in Washington for Los Angeles. The city once had four people each in
Washington and Sacramento, but the state Capitol crew is down to one
lobbyist and a secretary.</TE>
<TE>   With the governor and Legislature preparing to deal with a budget
deficit that has soared to $34.8 billion, mayoral spokeswoman Julie
Wong said the mayor might try to hire more lobbying help in
Sacramento in the near future to protect the city's interests.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also told secession leaders last week that he has spoken with
state legislators about meeting to coordinate efforts to help Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Such meetings are a good step, said Rep. Millender-McDonald. "The
mayor said he wants this [meeting] to be a regular thing, and I
agree."</TE>

<LD>A Santa Clarita man who allegedly performed female circumcisions and
other illegal body alterations at his home was arrested on suspicion
of practicing medicine without a license, state regulators said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Todd Cameron Bertrang, 40, was arrested Thursday on suspicion of
performing several dozen illegal and disfiguring medical procedures
since 1997, including clitoridectomies and penile piercings,
according to investigators with the Medical Board of California. The
agency is responsible for licensing and regulating physicians.</LD>
<LD>   "Your typical piercing doesn't rise to the level of practicing
medicine, which requires a license," said John Hirai, supervising
investigator for the agency.</LD>
<TE>   "In this case, Bertrang did procedures on people that altered
their body beyond a typical piercing."</TE>
<TE>   The victims, who were mostly in their 20s, were evenly split
between men and women, who sought out Bertrang to perform a variety
of "body modifications," Harai said. Bertrang detailed those
practices on a Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the site caught the attention of a doctor who
reported to the medical board that Bertrang was performing
clitoridectomies on women in Southern California. The agency launched
an investigation under a unit known as Operation Safe Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which had also received a
complaint about Bertrang, had opened its own probe about the same
time.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been with the medical board a long time, and I can't
remember a case like this," said agency spokesman David Thorton.
"It's unusual."</TE>
<TE>   Bertrang's arrest is the 10th this year through Operation Safe
Medicine, which investigates dangerous or unlicensed medical
practitioners.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information about other alleged victims of Bertrang,
or any other possible criminal activity connected to him, are asked
to contact the state medical board at (562) 860-2819. To confirm
whether someone is licensed medical practitioner, call the board's
information line at (916) 263-2382.</TE>

<HD>Gang Enforcer Gets Life Term in Prison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Rosenzweig</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moments after being sentenced Monday to life in prison without the
possibility of parole, Anthony "Coco" Zaragoza, chief enforcer for
the Columbia Lil' Cycos street gang, turned to two FBI agents seated
in the courtroom spectator gallery and, in a display of outlaw
bravado, flashed a big smile and a thumbs-up sign.</LD>
<LD>   "No hard feelings," he then told Assistant U.S. Atty. Bruce
Riordan, reaching out through manacles to shake the hand of the man
who helped send him away.</LD>
<LD>   Zaragoza, who has gang logos tattooed on his cheek and neck, is
one of three members of the Rampart-area gang found guilty in May
after a trial on federal racketeering charges.</LD>
<TE>   All told, 24 suspected members of the Lil' Cycos, a clique of the
notorious 18th Street gang, have been convicted in the case. They
include Zaragoza's former wife and his father.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said the Lil' Cycos case was one that cried out for
prosecution under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, a law enacted decades ago as a weapon against the
Mafia.</TE>
<TE>   The Lil' Cycos patterned themselves after an East Coast mob
family, exacting "rent" from street-level narcotics dealers in the
MacArthur Park area and plowing the proceeds into suburban homes, two
restaurants, a juice parlor and a used-car lot.</TE>
<TE>   When FBI agents and Los Angeles homicide detectives raided the
gang's properties, they seized more than $450,000 in cash along with
thousands of dollars worth of jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   The use of RICO to crack down on street gangs was on the agenda
last week when Los Angeles' new police chief, William J. Bratton, met
with U.S. Atty. Debra W. Yang and other federal law enforcement
officials to discuss escalating gang violence in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "RICO is a powerful tool," Riordan said Monday, "but it can only
be used when the circumstances are right. You can't a fit a square
peg into a round hole."</TE>
<TE>   The law works best, he said, when the gang has a leadership
structure and a sense of identity separate from the criminal
activities committed by the gang's members. Then, he said, "RICO can
be used to prosecute the gang vertically, from top to bottom, from
shot-caller to street soldier."</TE>
<TE>   Zaragoza, a gang "shot-caller" or lieutenant, was accused of
murdering two people and conspiring to kill a third in addition to
racketeering. Taking the witness stand in his own defense, he
admitted raking in about $5,000 a week in extortion payments from
drug dealers, but he denied committing or ordering any murders.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution's chief witness, Juan "Termite" Romero, a former
Lil' Cycos member, testified that he and Zaragoza used automatic
weapons to gun down a rival gang member who had been trying to move
in on Lil' Cycos territory. The target's female companion also was
killed in the fusillade.</TE>
<TE>   On the stand, Zaragoza spoke emotionally about his devotion to the
Lil' Cycos, which he lovingly described as his "family." In a letter
from jail, which was intercepted by investigators, Zaragoza referred
to the gang's leader, Frank "Pancho Villa" Martinez, as "dad" and to
Martinez's wife, Janie Garcia, as "mom."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, 38, who ran the Lil' Cycos from behind prison walls, was
convicted at the same trial in May of racketeering and other charges.
So was Alberto "Nefty" Pina, 29, who was described as a loyal
soldier. Martinez's wife went on trial with them, but negotiated a
plea agreement midway through the proceedings. All still await
sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   This was not the first time that the federal RICO law has been
used against Los Angeles-area gangs. Federal prosecutors have used
the law to successfully prosecute Mexican Mafia members. Trials are
pending against suspected members of the Wah Ching, the Nazi Low
Riders and the Aryan Brotherhood.</TE>

<HD>Teen Held in Gang Killing Escapes</HD>
<DH>Shackled youth flees a medical office and gets into a car,
which speeds away after the driver points a gun at probation
officers.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 15-year-old facing trial on charges of killing a rival gang member
escaped from custody Monday while at an orthodontist's office in
Huntington Park, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Ortiz was shackled at the ankles and escorted by two
unarmed Los Angeles County probation officers about 11 a.m. when he
fled from the office in the 2600 block of Gage Avenue and jumped into
a car.</LD>
<LD>   "Several patients walked in the office, creating enough of a
distraction that the minor bolted for the door," said Robert Smythe,
chief of the Los Angeles County Probation Department's detention
services bureau.</LD>
<TE>   "The driver displayed a firearm, and our staff backed off before
the driver took off down the street at a high rate of speed," Smythe
said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police said that Ortiz was awaiting trial for an Aug.
19 killing at Compton Avenue and 49th Street.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz, who was housed at Central Juvenile Hall, is the sixth youth
this year to escape from the custody of the Probation Department,
which has been under fire for the escapes. Two of them occurred
during medical appointments.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Gilliam, a 17-year-old gang member convicted of trying to
gun down three teenage boys, escaped from Sylmar Juvenile Hall in
March by breaking a window and scaling a fence topped with razor wire
two days before he faced a possible life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   He has not been found.</TE>
<TE>   In July, convicted murderer Jose Argueta, 17, used a gun to escape
from Central Juvenile Hall along with convicted murderer Marvin
Sandoval, 17, and convicted carjacker Fernando Nupiri, 18.</TE>
<TE>   All three remain at large.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, a 16-year-old being held at Central Juvenile Hall in
an armed robbery case escaped from custody while at a medical
appointment at a nearby clinic.</TE>
<TE>   The youth, Steven Frazier, is back in custody.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors ordered the Probation Department,
which runs the juvenile halls, to work with the sheriff's custody
division to find room in the county jails to house teenagers that are
either charged or convicted of adult crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Smythe noted, however, that a Los Angeles Juvenile Court judge
must order that minors be sent to County Jail, though it can be
requested by the Probation Department or the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, 40 juveniles have been placed in Los Angeles County
facilities out of a total population of 1,650 housed at the county's
three main juvenile detention complexes: the Central, Los Padrinos
and Barry J. Nidorf juvenile halls.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors last month ordered probation officials to
devise a plan to prevent escapes while transferring teenagers who
have been convicted as adults to County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   Probation officials, in turn, hired the county Sheriff's
Department to review security at juvenile halls.</TE>

<LD>A discussion here of complaints about late-night singing in one
neighborhood prompted Pat Wilson of Corona to write:</LD>
<LD>   "My daughter gave me a birthday party that lasted into the wee
hours. Unfortunately, so did our karaoke singing. In the frontyard. A
cop came by and told us to cease and desist. 'It's not that you're
singing too loudly,' he told us. 'It's just that you're such rotten
singers.' "</LD>

<TE>   An accidental high: "Were you ever involved in a holiday promotion
that went wrong?" author Don Barrett asked on his laradio.com Web
site. Disc jockey Whitney Allen recalled when she worked for a small
station that offered a same-day round trip on a small plane to a
Rolling Stones concert in San Francisco. Two high school kids won and
brought dates.</TE>
<TE>   Allen, who accompanied them, had no time for breakfast and gobbled
down some brownies her roommate had made. As the plane landed, she
said, "I was feeling a little strange.... These were not regular
brownies."</TE>
<TE>   At concert's end, "as I watched the sun set behind Keith Richards
and Mick's jumbo lips," the pilot informed her he didn't have
clearance to fly at night.</TE>
<TE>   Allen had to call the students' parents to say they'd miss school
the next day, rent two rooms at "some seedy motel" on her own credit
card, and segregate the boys and the girls.</TE>
<TE>   The girls wanted to have a slumber party. Allen, who was in their
room, ordered them to sleep, feeling older than her 20 years.</TE>

<TE>   A commuter classic: As is my custom, I'd like to read a bit now
from "The Night Before Christmas in California," by Catherine Smith
(see photo). It begins:</TE>
<TE>   "On the night before Christmas, all down 101/The traffic was
deadlocked; it wasn't much fun." You see, children, fog had shrouded
the state, grounding Santa.</TE>
<TE>   Officials appealed for help from everywhere. They even "called on
the Lakers/the Giants, 'Niners, Clippers/But there were no takers."
What's that? No, there were no rally monkeys back then, children.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, someone finally obtained "a court order, a clean writ of
habeas" that outlawed the fog and sent it off "to Las Vegas." And
Santa was able to make his rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it was the Christmas that was saved by a lawyer. I don't know
why Hallmark hasn't made a movie about it.</TE>

<LD>News report, Dec. 23, 2002</LD>
<LD>   President Bush showed no ill effects from his smallpox
vaccination, taking a morning jog at Camp David before going to
church. Bush is feeling "absolutely, positively fine," said White
House spokesman Adam Levine. Experts estimate 15 out of every 1
million people vaccinated for the first time will face
life-threatening complications, and one or two will die.</LD>
<LD>   Now this is great! This is statesmanship -- leading by example!
But why stop at the mere prick of a needle? Kings and statesmen have
always gone out slumming among their people incognito for what we'd
now call a reality check -- and a PR bonanza. King Alfred, so the
story goes, got smacked in the head by some 9th century housewife
after he was supposed to be watching her cakes cook but instead began
daydreaming about chasing the Danes out of his kingdom, and he let
the cakes burn. Shakespeare's King Henry V went among his troops in
disguise and nearly brawled with a soldier who ragged on the king's
reasons for going to war.</LD>
<TE>   Bill Clinton used to say he felt our pain (when he took time out
from feeling something else), but that's touchy-feely talk. A real
president doesn't just feel our pain, he shares it. President Bush --
you got that smallpox shot. Now get down with the people!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News report, Labor Day 2003</TE>
<TE>   President Bush today began practicing his pledge that he and his
family will live for six months on unemployment checks only, like so
many Americans caught in an economic bind. "I want to let the
American people know that I understand what it's like. My motto is,
no special treatment." He will still live on his Waco-area ranch for
security purposes, and sources said the president took the precaution
of sewing a couple of $20s and Dick Cheney's black American Express
card number into the soles of his cowboy boots for emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News report, Oct. 3, 2003</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, who has been patronizing the nation's fast-food
burger eateries while subsisting on unemployment checks, today came
down with symptoms of an E. coli infection. First Lady Laura Bush
drove him to the nearest hospital, part of the nation's biggest
for-profit hospital chain, founded by the family of Senate Majority
Leader Bill Frist. The hospital refused to admit the president
because he is technically unemployed during his six-month experiment
and has no health insurance. Doctors sent him home with aspirin and
Kaopectate.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Bush argued unsuccessfully with the admissions office that
because the chain, HCA Inc., had recently paid $631 million to settle
allegations of health-care fraud involving false claims and kickbacks
on Medicare and Medicaid, it owed the nation "a gesture of good
faith, and how better to restore that faith than by treating the
president in his time of need?" Potentially deadly E. coli bacteria
have been found in meat and poultry plants. A draft report by
congressional investigators last year noted that U.S. meat plants
that failed government food safety guidelines nonetheless sold meat
to consumers, in spite of Bush administration assurances that the
plants would be shut.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News report, Oct. 17, 2003</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, driving his sport utility vehicle to a job
interview as part of his "sharing America's pain" effort, was today
involved in a minor traffic accident that left him uninjured. Highway
patrol investigators said the driver of a Mexican truck bringing
avocados into the U.S. under new and controversial NAFTA regulations
got confused on a freeway interchange, braked suddenly and struck the
president's SUV near its fuel tank.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the accident could have been worse had the
president been driving with a full gas tank, but Bush joked with them
that he could only afford $5 worth of fuel at a time, giving him a
range of about 60 miles with current SUV fuel efficiency standards.
By the time the president finally arrived for the interview for an
assembly-line job building interceptor missiles for his own new
"missile shield" program, the jobs had been withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   The firm, whose CEO is a friend of the Bush family's, unexpectedly
decided to move the jobs to its Indonesian assembly plant.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, First Lady Laura Bush returned to work at a nearby
public library to help pay the bills while the president is
technically out of work. On her second day on the job, she was fired
after she defied as "inappropriate and un-American" requests from her
husband's Homeland Security investigators, refusing to give them a
list of library patrons who had checked out the children's book
"Magid Fasts for Ramadan."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News report, Nov. 27, 2003</TE>
<TE>   President Bush spent Thanksgiving with family and friends, chowing
down on the first White House turkey not to receive a presidential
pardon.</TE>
<TE>   The president, continuing his commitment to subsist on
unemployment benefits, said he felt bad having to take an ax to the
turkey, and would pardon two turkeys next year. But, he explained, he
couldn't afford to "commute the main course," because "store-bought"
turkey was too expensive, and by the time he heard about a food bank
turkey giveaway, and got to the food bank aboard the No. 18 bus --
which broke down en route -- they'd run out of free turkeys.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News report, Dec. 25, 2003</TE>
<TE>   President Bush returned unexpectedly to the White House aboard Air
Force One today, cutting short by about two months his experiment in
living on the margins of the nation's economy.</TE>
<TE>   In a possibly related move, Karl Rove, architect of much of Bush's
political philosophy, was seen being escorted by security from the

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood private detective Anthony J. Pellicano pleaded not guilty
Monday to charges of illegally possessing two unregistered hand
grenades and a quantity of plastic explosives in an office safe.</LD>
<LD>   The federal indictment stemmed from a search by FBI agents seeking
evidence of his alleged involvement in an attempt to threaten Los
Angeles Times reporter Anita Busch, who was investigating actor
Steven Seagal's relationship with a reputed Mafia associate.</LD>
<LD>   Another man, Alexander Proctor, is under arrest in connection with
the threat. Proctor allegedly told an FBI informant that Pellicano
paid him to carry out the threat on behalf of Seagal.</LD>
<TE>   Pellicano has denied being involved in any attempt to intimidate
The Times reporter, and the indictment makes no mention of the case.
Seagal also has denied any involvement</TE>

<HD>Coastal Panel Staff Opposes Road Widening</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Miguel Bustillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Coastal Commission planners have come out against a
proposal to widen a stretch of Lincoln Boulevard, the main
north-south artery into the Playa Vista development near Marina del
Rey, in a decision environmentalists said would enhance their vision
for a Ballona Wetlands state park.</LD>
<LD>   However, it is unclear whether the Coastal Commission, which has
gone against similar staff recommendations in the past, will take the
advice of its planners when it considers the road-widening proposal
next month. Both representatives of Playa Vista and environmental
groups opposed to the project said Monday that they did not believe
that the decision would affect the proposed second phase of the hotly
disputed development.</LD>
<LD>   The California Department of Transportation has proposed widening
Lincoln Boulevard, part of California 1, between Jefferson Boulevard
and Fiji Way, and building a four-lane bridge next to an existing
bridge crossing Ballona Creek.</LD>
<TE>   But the Coastal Commission staff concluded in its report that the
project was "designed for a level of growth that may not occur,"
given recent changes at Playa Vista and the surrounding area.</TE>
<TE>   First proposed by Caltrans in the mid-1990s, the road widening was
initially supposed to support a larger load of traffic from the more
ambitious initial plans for Playa Vista and from a sizable proposed
expansion of Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   But the airport plans have since been downscaled, and the
developers of Playa Vista are proposing to build 5,846 housing units,
far fewer than the 13,000 originally planned, as well as about 70%
less retail space and 33% less office space. The first phase of the
development, which is underway, includes 3,246 residential units.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the reduction is expected because Playa Vista is trying to
sell property west of Lincoln Boulevard, thereby staving off
development on 193 acres, which would instead become a nature
preserve. The land is part of the Ballona Wetlands ecosystem.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed Lincoln Boulevard bridge, the Coastal Commission
planners stated in their report, would require the building of piers
that would harm the wetlands and sensitive birds, including the
endangered brown pelican.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Sugerman, a Playa Vista spokesman, downplayed the
significance of the planners' recommendation, noting that the
development now being proposed is much smaller than called for when
the road improvements were first suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "This does not affect the current development plans at all," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rex Frankel, president of the Ballona Ecosystem Education Project,
said that although he remains concerned about the second phase of
Playa Vista, he too does not believe that scrapping the road-widening
plan would affect the development.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, the entire Playa Vista project is about half of what
it was," he said. "There is absolutely no need anymore. The existing
road is sufficient to handle what traffic is expected now."</TE>
<TE>   However, stopping the expansion, especially the bridge plan, would
benefit the increasingly likely future state park, Frankel said. It
would create an opportunity to instead build a more environmentally
sound crossing for pedestrians and cyclists that is favored by local
activists.</TE>
<TE>   "It would mean the Ballona state park would be much better off,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tomas Carranza, a city transportation engineer, said it was
difficult to determine the impact that stopping the road project
would have, because the latest Playa Vista plans still need to be
reviewed for traffic and environmental impact.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we see how much traffic their new project will generate on
Lincoln, we will not be able to say" whether a road widening is still
needed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Coastal Commission, which has land-use authority over projects
near the ocean, previously approved expansions of other segments of
Lincoln Boulevard between Marina del Rey and Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   It also approved a proposal to widen a stretch of nearby Culver
Boulevard against the recommendations of its staff planners.</TE>

<HD>'Former' Con Artist Accused of Bilking 84-Year-Old Man</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Rosenzweig</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles man once featured on national television as a reformed
con artist dedicated to fighting consumer fraud was arrested Monday,
this time on suspicion of bilking an 84-year-old man out of half a
million dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Robert Comisar, 41, was ordered held without bail by a
federal magistrate, who called him an economic danger to the
community. "I think it would be negligent on my part to put this
defendant back out on the street and expose some other 84-year-old,"
said magistrate Judge Patrick J. Walsh.</LD>
<LD>   Assuming the government's allegations are true, the judge said,
"this man has the ability to call someone he's never met before and
talk him out of his life's savings. What do I say to the next
victim?"</LD>
<TE>   Comisar was convicted in Los Angeles federal court in 1983, 1990,
1994 and 1999 for various telemarketing frauds.</TE>
<TE>   He served three years in prison for his most recent scam, and was
on probation in January when he allegedly telephoned Arthur Baldwin,
an elderly retiree in Minneapolis, offering him a chance to invest in
a television show in the planning stage. An FBI affidavit said
Comisar had identified himself as "Gene Reiner," executive producer
of the "International Television Network" in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of several months, Comisar persuaded Baldwin to
pour more and more money into the making of the bogus show, "Trends
of the 21st Century," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Tom Warren, who
prosecuted Comisar in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Warren said Comisar was soliciting money from Baldwin as recently
as two weeks ago. By that time, however, the FBI had entered the case
and tape-recorded his telephone conversations with Baldwin.</TE>
<TE>   Comisar deposited most of the money he got from Baldwin into a
bank account he shares with his mother, Warren told the judge. Some
of the money was used to buy a 2003 Corvette, while other funds went
for child support to his estranged third wife and to pay
court-ordered restitution to his previous victim, a retired engineer
who was bilked out of $100,000, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his 1999 arrest, Comisar was making the rounds on
national TV shows promoting his book, "America's Guide to Fraud
Prevention." He dedicated the work to a federal judge who had freed
him on probation after an earlier conviction instead of sentencing
him to 46 months in prison.</TE>

<KH>BEHIND THE WHEEL</KH>
<HD>Solo in the Carpool Lane but Stuck at the Pump</HD>
<DH>Compressed natural gas vehicles definitely have their
advantages, but the availability of fill-ups isn't among them yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troy Mitchell spent three months looking for his dream car. He
researched and rented several clean-air vehicles before he settled on
a 2000 Ford Crown Victoria, a big, comfortable car that runs on
clean-burning natural gas.</LD>
<LD>   Ah, a roomy sedan with an environmental conscience, he thought.</LD>
<LD>   The perks have been great. Compressed natural gas, or CNG for
short, is about 30% cheaper than gasoline. And, thanks to a state law
that allows solo drivers in clean-air vehicles to use the carpool
lanes, Mitchell cruises past Southern California's notorious freeway
congestion.</LD>
<TE>   But his gas guzzler has one major drawback: A few days after he
bought it, Mitchell was standing at a CNG filling station, begging
other motorists to buy him gas to fill up his tank.</TE>
<TE>   For all the environmental benefits compressed natural gas offers,
it is still not readily available to private citizens like Mitchell.
The vast majority of the 20,000 CNG vehicles on the road in
California belong to fleets -- taxis, trash trucks, shuttle vans --
used by government agencies and private companies that operate their
own on-site filling stations.</TE>
<TE>   Experts estimate that only about 200 private individuals in the
state own CNG cars.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, an inventor from Granada Hills, is paying a price for
being a member of such a tiny minority.</TE>
<TE>   Because so few private citizens own natural-gas cars, only about
half of the 220 CNG filling stations in the state are open to the
general public.</TE>
<TE>   Of those, about half require a gas credit card approved by the gas
company that owns the station.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, that amounts to only about 18 CNG stations
that serve the public and accept major credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, out-of-town trips require lots of planning to
ensure that a station is always within a tank-full drive.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason CNG stations are rare is that they require more
costly technology than regular gas stations.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell learned all of this the hard way when he first tried to
fill up at a CNG station in the San Fernando Valley without a gas
credit card.</TE>
<TE>   The pump would not take cash or a major credit card and there was
no attendant to offer help.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for Mitchell, he found another motorist with a gas card
willing to take cash to fill up Mitchell's tank.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest downside," he said, "is definitely getting gas."</TE>
<TE>   But natural gas vendors promise change is coming soon.</TE>
<TE>   The sales of CNG cars to the general public are expected to grow
in the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   Gas vendors like Southern California Gas Co. and ENRG Corp. are
responding with plans to open more stations in the near future and to
convert most of the existing stations to accept major credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   "Slowly but surely, the infrastructure is being built out," said
Andrew Littlefair, CEO of ENRG, a firm based in Seal Beach that
operates 90 CNG stations in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Gas Co. promises to convert all of its CNG
stations to accept major credit cards by the end of next year.</TE>
<TE>   One reason sales of CNG cars are expected to rise is that Honda
Motor Co. announced recently that it will market its new
natural-gas-powered Civic GX to the general public next year. The
sleek, 100-horsepower Civic GX is touted as having the
cleanest-burning internal combustion engine in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Honda is also playing a role in making sure GX owners will have
places to fill up. Honda owns a 20% stake in FuelMaker Corp., a
Toronto-based firm that plans to begin next year to sell a home-based
fueling appliance that can fill up a CNG car via a home's natural gas
line.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell does not consider himself a militant environmentalist. He
simply can't stand freeway congestion and insisted on having a car
that could cut his commute time.</TE>
<TE>   By driving in the carpool lane, Mitchell has cut his daily commute
from Granada Hills to his job in Santa Monica and back by about an
hour.</TE>
<TE>   He considered buying an electric car but was put off by the long
battery-recharging period. The increasingly popular hybrid cars,
which run on electricity and gasoline, don't need the long recharging
but they don't meet the emissions standards to qualify for the
carpool-lane exemption.</TE>
<TE>   There are other perks to owning a CNG car, like a state tax credit
of as much as $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Santa Monica and other environmentally minded
cities, owners of CNG cars and electric vehicles can park without
feeding the city parking meters.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, most parking enforcement officers don't know about
the law.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell said he has received dozens of parking tickets for
failing to feed the meter.</TE>
<TE>   He gets the tickets dismissed by sending a copy of his clean-air
vehicle certificate to the traffic court.</TE>
<TE>   "So it costs me 37 cents for a stamp to dismiss a ticket that I
could have avoided by feeding the meter with 25 cents," he said,
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   To roll in the carpool lanes, owners of clean-air vehicles must
apply for a decal from the Department of Motor Vehicles, which is
displayed on the bumper.</TE>
<TE>   But that law is not common knowledge either, even among the
California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell said he was stopped recently by a CHP officer who was
completely in the dark about the carpool-lane exemption for clean-air
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'You must know why I pulled you over, right?' and I
said, 'No, I don't,' " Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   Most motorists are also ignorant of the law.</TE>
<TE>   That would explain the angry glares, rude gestures and curses
Mitchell gets from other drivers nearly every time he uses the
carpool lanes alone.</TE>
<TE>   That's why he came up with the idea for the cheesy, inflatable sex
doll.</TE>
<TE>   She sits in the passenger seat next to him, a surprised plastic
expression on her face.</TE>
<TE>   He said he still gets stares but they are mostly looks of
puzzlement, not anger.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the drawbacks, Mitchell has no regrets about buying a CNG
car. But he worries that if natural gas-powered cars become too
popular, lawmakers will eliminate the exemption to drive in the
carpool lanes.</TE>
<TE>   "I would recommend it to others," he said. "But I wouldn't
recommend it to everyone because I don't want to lose my diamond lane
privileges."</TE>

<HD>Film Agency President Resigns Under a Cloud</HD>
<DH>Cody Cluff, suspected of misappropriation and perjury, gets
$287,000 severance package.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Cody Cluff, one of the founders and the only president of the
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., resigned Monday with a
$287,000 severance package and an uncertain future as he confronts
allegations of misappropriation and perjury.</LD>
<LD>   The departure allows the film board's executive committee, made up
of prominent local politicians and others, to focus on restructuring
the agency so that no future president will be given the
freewheeling, unchecked power that Cluff enjoyed during his
seven-year tenure, members said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement ends a monthlong feud that started Nov. 22, when
Cluff refused to honor the board's decision to force him out on a
paid leave of absence.</LD>
<TE>   Cluff signed the agreement Saturday. Board Chairman Frank Scherma
signed Monday on behalf of the executive committee. The resignation
is retroactive to Dec. 16.</TE>
<TE>   The deal gives Cluff up to $200,000 for future legal expenses,
plus about $87,000 in salary and fringe benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement allows the agency to approve or disapprove legal
bills. If convicted, Cluff agreed to reimburse the agency for any
defense costs.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office has not filed formal charges
against Cluff.</TE>
<TE>   In a search warrant affidavit signed in September, investigators
alleged that Cluff misused hundreds of thousands of dollars in film
board funds for trips to resorts, expensive wine and exorbitant
restaurant tips and for campaign contributions to elected officials,
19 of whom served on the agency's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit raised questions about more than $20,000 in
cashier's checks purchased by the agency and given to Cluff, more
than $50,000 in direct payments to Cluff's personal American Express
card, the purchase of a $350 bottle of wine and other expenses. Cluff
also had directed nearly $47,000 to the Pittsburgh Film Office and a
national film organization run by a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky and City
Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, members of the agency's executive
committee, said the agreement was a good deal for the public.</TE>
<TE>   They said it satisfies the legal responsibility to provide Cluff
with money for legal fees, puts a cap on the amount he is entitled to
receive, and requires him to answer all questions posed by the film
board's consultants, which were hired to examine the corporation's
finances and management practices.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cheaper to enter into this agreement," Yaroslavsky said,
noting that under the bylaws, Cluff could possibly extend the
controversy for many more months and run up legal bills.</TE>
<TE>   If Cluff is charged and convicted, he would be required to
reimburse the legal fees.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the film board said Monday that legal bills
related to the investigation so far total about $120,000, which would
not count toward the $200,000 maximum available to Cluff under
Monday's agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's bylaws require that any employee "shall be
indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred" for
legal costs if they are successful in any "civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative proceeding" brought against them
because of their work for the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Film board officials also have said the salary package amounts to
no more than what the paid leave would have given Cluff had he chosen
to accept it.</TE>
<TE>   Film board consultant Keith Comrie said Cluff has argued that
every dollar he spent was "in a good-faith" effort to do his job
promoting Los Angeles County to the film industry, and to streamline
the process for issuing permits to production companies to shoot on
location.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not seen any evidence to date that he has done anything
in bad faith," Comrie said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing that the district attorney has offered so far
that would argue otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   Comrie said the film board's audit and the district attorney's
investigation are not complete.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley sent letters to film board
members that some interpreted as warnings against providing money for
Cluff's defense.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry White, who is heading the criminal
investigation, declined to comment on the severance package, but said
film board members are not in a position to know whether Cluff
committed any crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "Their audit is just getting underway, and they have not gone
through enough records to make that determination," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's what we're doing now -- going through the records to
determine whether a crime has been committed."</TE>
<TE>   Comrie said Cluff has offered explanations for all expenses.</TE>
<TE>   He said Cluff also has explained the perjury accusations, which
allege that he provided false information on state tax and
registration documents, as "oversights by accountants that were later
corrected."</TE>
<TE>   Cluff referred questions about the severance package to his
attorney, Mark Werksman, who called it "the right thing for both
sides."</TE>
<TE>   "Now, Cody and the EIDC can work together to solve any issues
brought forth by the D.A.," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Werksman said Cluff's willingness to cooperate with auditors
"reflects his innocent state of mind, and that he wants to assist in
investigating everything that's being questioned."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said he doesn't know whether Cluff's explanations for
his expenses are adequate.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us have thumbed through the 70 boxes of information"
prosecutors are examining, he said. "But so far, he has not been
charged with anything.</TE>
<TE>   "If he is never charged with a crime and runs up a million dollars
[in legal bills], he could have come back at EIDC for that under the
terms of the bylaws.</TE>
<TE>   "This agreement caps our total defense costs at $200,000. If he is
convicted, we could recover the money after the fact."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said the agreement relieves the film agency's staff
from the distractions of Cluff's legal problems and frees the board
to begin restructuring the organization.</TE>
<TE>   He said that whatever structure emerges, the governing board must
do a better job of keeping tabs on the staff and ensuring that the
president is held accountable.</TE>
<TE>   "We bear the responsibility for not being more attentive as we
should have been," Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "I am more angry about this than anybody is."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said that while she cannot draw any conclusions about the
legality of Cluff's actions, she does think that some decisions
reflect bad judgment, which is why the executive committee voted to
put him on a leave of absence late last month.</TE>
<TE>   "This agreement moves us another step toward reorganizing this
entity," she said.</TE>

<HD>Reprieve From Holiday Eviction</HD>
<DH>Caltrans delays a Christmas Eve deadline. Still, family
vows to fight to stay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin and Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Christmas wreath hangs on the door and colored lights ring the
Corrales family's Pasadena home in a warm glow.</LD>
<LD>   But while other children tonight will be happily anticipating a
visit from St. Nick, the California Department of Transportation --
the Corraleses' landlord -- wants the family to be thinking about
packing up the wreath, taking down the lights and finding a new place
to call home.</LD>
<LD>   If they don't leave voluntarily, Caltrans warned in a letter last
week, they will be removed by "whatever steps are necessary."</LD>
<TE>   The Corrales home on Bellefontaine Street is one of nearly 600
properties managed by Caltrans along the proposed extension of the
Long Beach Freeway. Caltrans has owned many of the homes since the
1950s, when construction of the extension seemed imminent. But
opposition to the project has put it on hold for decades, forcing
Caltrans to act as a residential landlord in Pasadena, South Pasadena
and El Sereno.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Corrales family, Caltrans officials admit they
erred in letting the family move into the house last month before the
rental application was approved. But now that the application has
been rejected, Caltrans said the family needs to clear out -- soon.</TE>
<TE>   But David Corrales said he is not going to leave without a fight.
He said Caltrans gave him a key and a signed rental agreement, and he
is not willing to move his wife, Gloria, and their children --
Anastasia, 5; Rachael, 3; and 11-month-old David Jr. -- out of the
house.</TE>
<TE>   "We plan to stay here unless they can prove legally that we don't
have a right to be here," he said. "We've dug in the trenches."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans spokeswoman Debra Harris defended the agency, saying it
is trying to be as flexible as possible with the family.</TE>
<TE>   The Dec. 20 letter to the Corrales family instructed them to make
plans by Christmas Eve to leave, but Harris said Monday that Caltrans
will allow the family to stay until after the holidays. She also said
Caltrans will reimburse the family for its moving expenses and will
allow them to move back into a smaller Caltrans house that the family
had previously rented.</TE>
<TE>   Corrales, a teacher working for the Los Angeles County Office of
Education, previously lived in the smaller Caltrans property on Jane
Place for more than seven years, first as a bachelor and eventually
with his wife and children. But over the last three years, the family
ran into plumbing and asbestos problems at the house -- problems that
always seemed to crop up around the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, he said, when asbestos was found under the carpets,
the family Christmas tree was moved to the front yard.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Corrales said, Robert Richardson, a Caltrans right-of-way
agent, notified him that a larger four-bedroom, three-bath Caltrans
home on Bellefontaine Street was available for rent.</TE>
<TE>   Corrales filled out the rental application and, by Nov. 1,
Richardson gave the family the green light to move in. Corrales said
he received a signed rental agreement and in return paid Caltrans
more than $9,000 for the first and last month's rent and a deposit.</TE>
<TE>   Corrales and his wife say they have endured the problems with
Caltrans in the past partly because state law gives tenants the first
option to buy their homes if the property is not needed for the Long
Beach Freeway project.</TE>
<TE>   But the couple's plans for the Bellefontaine Street home began to
fall apart when they asked Caltrans to approve the installation of a
phone line. They said Caltrans officials seemed surprised that the
family had moved into the house and informed them that they had
failed to qualify for the home.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, a man appeared at he family's front door with the
letter from a Caltrans property manager that states: "It is the
department's position that you do not have any right to occupy the
property ... and accordingly we ask that you take immediate steps to
vacate the property and remove any and all personal belongings from
the premises."</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, Caltrans blames the Corraleses or "your
misunderstanding regarding your rental application."</TE>
<TE>   But in an interview, Harris conceded that it was Caltrans that
made the mistake by giving the Corraleses the keys to the house
before the application received final approval. She declined to say
why the application was rejected. Corrales said he has submitted pay
stubs to Caltrans to prove that he can afford the $3,300 monthly
rent.</TE>
<TE>   As for Richardson, the agent who gave the Corrales family the keys
to the house, the Caltrans letter said "he is in the process of a
temporary reassignment."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Corrales has already rejected Caltrans' suggestion that he move
his family back to the smaller house on Jane Place.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not moving out," he said, and promised to put up a
Christmas tree.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have one Christmas without a tree outside," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Some Caltrans tenants say the notice to vacate is only the latest
example of Grinch-like treatment they have endured at the hands of
the state agency.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't a tenant in one of the houses who doesn't have a
horror story about how they are treated by Caltrans," said Lynn
Bryan, who has been renting from the agency for 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   She said she sympathizes with the Corrales family. "This is a
terrible thing to do to a family with little children," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said Caltrans is willing to listen and respond to tenant
complaints. "Caltrans wants to manage the properties in the best way
possible," she said.</TE>

<HD>Man Sues Over Picasso Stolen by Nazis</HD>
<DH>Heir of the Jewish owner is seeking $10 million from art
collector or return of the painting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The grandson of a Jewish woman who fled Nazi Germany has asked a
judge in Los Angeles to order a Chicago art collector to return a
Pablo Picasso painting allegedly stolen by Nazis during World War II
or pay $10 million to keep it.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney E. Randol Schoenberg said Monday that he is not sure
whether his client, Thomas C. Bennigson, a UC Berkeley law student
and sole heir of Carlota Landsberg, was aware before this year that
his family once owned a valuable Picasso.</LD>
<LD>   Bennigson got a call earlier this year from the Art Loss Register
in London, notifying him that the painting had been located,
according to Schoenberg.</LD>
<TE>   He tried to negotiate with Los Angeles art dealer David Tunkl to
receive compensation for his grandmother's 1922 painting, known as
"Femme en blanc" or "Femme assise."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge David Yaffe scheduled a
Christmas Eve hearing on the case. Late Friday he issued a temporary
restraining order directing that the painting remain in Los Angeles
until its disputed ownership could be decided.</TE>
<TE>   But it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   The painting already had been shipped back to Marilyn Alsdorf's
Chicago apartment, where it has hung for the last 30 years, Alsdorf's
attorney, David M. Rownd, said Monday. She had sent it to the Los
Angeles gallery for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Schoenberg said he would ask the judge to modify his order to
allow the painting to remain with Alsdorf in Chicago until the
dispute is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Schoenberg said a new state law, which is effective Jan. 1,
extends the statute of limitations for all claims against museums and
galleries over Nazi-looted artworks to Dec. 31, 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Tunkl, a defendant in the suit, did not return telephone calls to
his gallery Monday and his attorney, Stephen Bernard, could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But Rownd said he plans to fight any effort to return the painting
to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time the restraining order was issued, the painting was
not in California," he said. "It's our intention to contest the
court's jurisdiction."</TE>
<TE>   Rownd said Alsdorf "certainly had no indication of anything
alleged in the complaint." He said she is vacationing in Florida and
unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Alsdorf's late husband, James Alsdorf, bought the painting from
the Stephen Hahn Gallery in New York in 1975 for $357,000, according
to the declaration by Sarah Jackson, the historic claims director at
the Art Loss Register, that was filed with the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said the register -- the world's largest private
international database of lost and stolen art, antiques and
collectibles -- was asked to investigate the painting in December
2001 for a French art dealer who was thinking about acquiring it for
a client.</TE>
<TE>   That is when they realized that it had been stolen decades
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Before Bennigson's grandmother escaped Nazi Germany, she sent the
painting to J.K. Thannhauser, a well-known Parisian art dealer, in
1938 or 1939 for safekeeping.</TE>
<TE>   But Nazis looted the painting and other valuables from Thannhauser
in 1940, according to a 1958 letter that Thannhauser wrote to
Landsberg.</TE>
<TE>   Bennigson said in his declaration that his grandmother, who died
in 1994, "made reasonable efforts to locate the painting after it was
taken by the Nazis ... but [he] did not discover the whereabouts of
the painting until 2002."</TE>

<HD>Davis Paroles 1st Male Murderer</HD>
<DH>The governor grants freedom to a Hmong community leader who
had been provoked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis for the first time in his tenure paroled a man
convicted of murder, concluding Monday that a leader of the Hmong
community in Stockton should be freed, 15 years after he shot and
killed Christopher Dabbs, 21.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Davis decided to keep five other men in prison.
His decision overturned rulings by the Board of Prison Terms that
would have freed the men convicted of second-degree murder for crimes
in the 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' decision to grant parole to Chu Ly, 71, was only the third
time since he took office in 1999 that he has approved parole in a
murder case. He has considered more than 220 parole cases. The other
two killers to win parole were battered women who had been convicted
of killing their abusers</LD>
<TE>   In agreeing to Ly's release, Davis reversed a decision he made in
January to deny parole. Ly was convicted of the 1987 killing of
Dabbs, who had vandalized several vehicles in Ly's neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Davis now said he had concluded that Ly posed no danger to society
and had strong family support in his adopted hometown of Stockton. As
part of his written findings, Davis cited evidence of "repeated
provocation and lack of police intervention" to protect Hmongs
against vandalism.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Ly and the Laotian community in which he was respected as an
elder were long-suffering victims of hate crimes by persons who,
according to the deputy district attorney, hated Asians and blacks,"
Davis wrote in the five-page decision dated Friday but announced
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was lauded by the Stockton police chief and a current
leader of the Hmong community.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, who has honed his tough-on-crime credentials by
repeatedly denying parole to convicted murderers, cited letters from
the Stockton police chief, the judge who presided over the case and
the original prosecutor, all supporting Ly's release.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision reflects the governor's view on this particular
case," Davis spokesman Byron Tucker said, noting that Davis' decision
does not reflect a softening of his stand generally opposing parole.
"Gov. Davis has always evaluated parole cases independently on their
own merits."</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for inmates repeatedly have challenged Davis' decisions
on parole, arguing that he improperly has a blanket policy against
granting releases.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the state Supreme Court rejected one such
challenge, ruling that governors have wide latitude in deciding
parole cases. The court concluded governors need only some evidence
to support their decisions to deny parole.</TE>
<TE>   Based on that decision, Davis had little choice but to free Ly,
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Himelblau of San Joaquin County, who
appeared at Ly's parole hearing earlier this year. "What is the
justification for keeping him in prison?" Himelblau asked. "You can't
find anything. If anybody should be released, it should be this guy."</TE>
<TE>   Ly had significant status among his fellow immigrants, having
served as a captain on the side of the U.S. armed forces and the CIA
in the war against communists in Laos.</TE>
<TE>   He and other Laotians had complained for more than a year to
police about vandalism of their cars. On the night of killing, Dabbs
and a friend had been riding through Ly's neighborhood on a bicycle,
smashing cars with a baseball bat. Ly called police, only to be told
that officers would not respond unless he had apprehended a vandal.</TE>
<TE>   Ly ran out and, speaking in his native tongue, shouted for the
vandals to stop. When they rode off, Ly fired a shot, intending to
scare them. The bullet hit Dabbs in the armpit and entered his head.</TE>
<TE>   Dabbs' friend told police that after shooting Dabbs, Ly said,
"Good." Ly denied making such a comment, noting that he didn't speak
English at the time. A cultural clash also played a part in Ly's
refusal to plead guilty to a lesser charge of involuntary
manslaughter. Davis, again quoting the prosecutor, said Ly feared he
would be "taken out and shot" if he admitted complicity in the
killing.</TE>
<TE>   In his first review of the case in January, Davis concluded that
the motive for the murder was trivial, and that Ly should have
allowed authorities to handle the vandalism.</TE>
<TE>   In a second hearing, Stockton Police Chief Edward Chavez sent a
letter and Himelblau testified to clarify circumstances surrounding
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Prosecutors have provided a very different picture of the
circumstances surrounding the shooting," Davis wrote. "Also, I
believe that the repeated provocation and lack of police intervention
placed Mr. Ly under significant stress that had been building over a
long period of time."</TE>
<TE>   Ly is expected to freed from the state prison at San Luis Obispo
in March.</TE>
<TE>   "The community will be happy that he will be released," said
Chieng Lo, of the Lao Family Community of Stockton, which advocated
Ly's release.</TE>
<TE>   Stockton Police Chief Chavez called the governor's decision
appropriate. He said the murder of Dabbs was not justified" but added
that the police force in 1987 was not as aggressive as it is now in
investigating so-called hate crimes.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that Ly was a "target of crime because of who he
was."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Faces Fines for Sewer Spills</HD>
<DH>The city might have to pay up to $8 million after a judge
rules that it is liable for hundreds of incidents. Federal suit
sought to force repairs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Monday found the city of Los Angeles liable for
hundreds of sewage spills that have fouled neighborhoods and polluted
the ocean, marking a turning point in a four-year court fight aimed
at forcing the city to repair its often clogged and leaky sewer
lines.</LD>
<LD>   The city faces fines of up to $8 million under the initial ruling
by U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew, who found the city liable for
297 spills over the course of a year. Fines of up to $27,500 per
spill may continue to mount with every violation of the federal Clean
Water Act. The suit was brought by federal and state officials,
environmental organizations and homeowner groups in Baldwin Hills,
the Crenshaw district and Leimert Park.</LD>
<LD>   "These kinds of spills continue to happen on average two times a
day," said Fran Diamond, chairwoman of the Los Angeles Regional Water
Quality Control Board. "It's from roots blocking lines, grease from
restaurants. The city should be able to provide basic city service.
This isn't a Third World city. We should be able to do better."</LD>
<TE>   Adel Hagekhalil, a division manager in the city's bureau of
sanitation, said the city is stepping up its schedule of cleaning
pipelines and replacing sewer lines that have broken or become
overwhelmed. He said a citywide program to cut down on restaurants
dumping grease down the drain has resulted in a 30% reduction in
spills from grease-clogged pipes.</TE>
<TE>   "The Board of Public Works is committed to reducing sewage
spills," Hagekhalil said. "We have a goal to reduce spills by 25%
between now and 2005."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has 6,500 miles of sewer lines and dozens of pumping
stations that funnel water to four treatment plans, including the
Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant in Playa del Rey. About half of
the city's sewer pipes are a half-century old and, according to state
and federal officials, have a sewage spill rate of more than double
of other Southern California cities.</TE>
<TE>   Fixing a system that large with so many problems will probably
require more than just goals, said Steve Fleischli, executive
director of the nonprofit Santa Monica BayKeeper.</TE>
<TE>   "When we filed this lawsuit they had 350 sewage spills that they
reported. In 2001, they reported 682 spills. A 25% reduction in that
doesn't even put us in a place when we started."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischli, who has been pressing to settle the case, is angry that
the city redirected $600,000 from its sewer maintenance fund to hire
a private law firm to fight the lawsuit and then, on Monday, conceded
liability in all but four of the 297 spills, which occurred from July
2001 through July 2002.</TE>
<TE>   In the remaining four spills, the city argued that it is not
liable because raw sewage was captured on city streets and never made
it to a protected stream, river or ocean. Judge Lew dismissed that
defense, ruling that the spills violated the Clean Water Act even if
the sewage didn't reach the Los Angeles River, Ballona Creek, the
Santa Monica Bay or the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   That ruling was significant because it means the city could be
found liable for thousands of spills that have occurred since 1998,
not just those that have been documented as having reached protected
waters.</TE>
<TE>   The potential for millions of dollars in extra fines may be enough
to pressure the city to settle the lawsuit, lawyers for the
plaintiffs hope.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the groups that brought the suit want the city to
adopt an enforceable schedule of reducing spills by a certain
percentage each year, Hagekhalil said. If the schedule isn't met, the
city would face penalties and automatic increases in required
cleaning, upgrades and maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   The city is asking for more flexibility, he said, without
arbitrary standards. "The city has invested over $1 billion in the
last 10 years to renew and upgrade its sewer system. We have
committed $2 billion over the next 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   Such investment may not be enough to keep pace with aging
infrastructure -- a problem faced by many other cities, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA has brought similar suits against Atlanta, Miami, New
Orleans and Baltimore. San Diego, under an administrative order from
the EPA, recently increased residential sewer fees to pay for
upgrades to reduce a pattern of spills similar to those in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Sewage spills are a major source of pollution and a significant
threat to human health," said Wayne Nastri, the EPA's regional
administrator in San Francisco. "Making sure municipalities manage
their sewage properly moves us toward the EPA's goal of purer water
... and better protection of public health."</TE>
<TE>   Parts of the system seem to be straining under current capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Baldwin Hills, the Crenshaw district and Leimert Park
have spent decades complaining about a foul "rotten egg" odor from
sewer gases from the system around Rodeo Road and La Cienega
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes and it goes, but when it comes it's bad," said Calvin
Hill, who lives nearby. "It permeates the house and the neighbor's
house. It gets into the clothes and it stays."</TE>
<TE>   Opal Young of the Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw Homeowners Coalition said
residents have been getting the runaround for years when they tried
to find a responsible agency to take action. "It's been going on for
30 years," she said. "You are driving down the road and it hits you.
It's like rotten eggs and body parts. People cannot barbecue
outdoors."</TE>
<TE>   City officials expect that particular problem to be remedied in
about a year when crews compete a $280-million sewer upgrade to
handle extra capacity, as well as build seven odor-control facilities
at a cost about $45 million.</TE>

<HD>Paroled Rap Mogul Arrested</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton and Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rap music mogul Marion "Suge" Knight was taken into custody Monday
for alleged parole violations that could send him back to prison for
a year, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   State parole official Fernando Rios declined to explain the
violations allegedly committed by the 37-year-old founder of Death
Row Records.</LD>
<LD>   But law enforcement sources said some of the four violations
relate to Knight's alleged association with reputed gang members who
authorities say are connected to a series of retaliatory shootings
this year. As a condition of his parole, Knight is not allowed to
associate with gang members.</LD>
<TE>   Knight was taken into custody Monday afternoon by Los Angeles
County sheriff's deputies after meeting with his parole officer in
Van Nuys. Knight will be in custody until a hearing on his case.</TE>
<TE>   Knight's lawyer, David Z. Chesnoff, said he was surprised by the
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Knight has done everything within his power to avoid any kind
of trouble and at the same time remain active in the hip-hop
recording community," Chesnoff said. "His association with people
that the parole board finds objectionable is in all likelihood, if
true, directly connected to the music business and nothing else."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, Knight's company, now called Tha Row, propelled
hard-core rap from the fringe into the headphones of teenagers
nationwide and generated $100 million a year in album sales. But the
colorful, Compton-born mogul never let go of his tough-guy roots.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, he was convicted of assault and federal weapons
violations, but was given probation. In 1996, he was incarcerated for
five years for violating the terms of his probation after he and
several associates, including rap star Tupac Shakur, were recorded on
videotape beating a gang rival in the lobby of a Las Vegas hotel.
Three hours after that, Shakur was fatally shot on the Las Vegas
strip and Knight, who was with him, was wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Since his release from prison last year, Knight has vowed to
rebuild his company and stay out of trouble. But in recent months, he
has been dogged by an Los Angeles County sheriff's investigation into
a string of shootings allegedly committed by employees of Tha Row,
some in retaliation for the killing of employee and Knight friend
Alton "Buntry" McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department has pushed for Knight's return to prison,
providing a detailed report of Knight's alleged parole violations
garnered in part from a November raid on Knight's homes and
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave his parole officer evidence to substantiate that Mr.
Knight has violated his parole on several occasions," said Sheriff's
Lt. Bob Rifkin.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators stopped Knight's car April 3 and found him
with Timmy "Timmy Ru" McDonald, an alleged member of the Mob Town
Pirus. That night, McDonald's brother, Alton, had been fatally shot
as he stood beside his sport utility vehicle at a gas station in
Compton.</TE>
<TE>   In retaliation, law enforcement sources said, Eric "Scar" Daniel
was shot and killed June 7, and another man was shot and wounded
Sept. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, sheriff's investigators obtained an arrest warrant for
Timmy McDonald as part of an investigation into a string of shootings
involving rival members of two Bloods gang factions. McDonald
allegedly tried to shoot a man Oct. 22 in retaliation for the slaying
of Knight associate Henry "Hendog" Smith six days earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the suspects in those shootings are on the payroll of
Tha Row, and a car used in one of the shootings was tied to Tha Row,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Three other Knight associates were arrested last month during the
raid on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. They were later
released and no charges were filed.</TE>
<TE>   During that raid, sheriff's investigators found evidence that
Knight lived in a Malibu home without the knowledge of his parole
officer. Law enforcement sources also said they had recovered
photographs of Knight and gang members at a party making gang signs
with their fingers.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Council Split on Iraqi Declaration</HD>
<DH>Russia, France and China say they are not convinced that
Baghdad's report on weapons fails to meet resolution's demands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski and Sebastian Rotella</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>MOSCOW -- Three key members of the U.N. Security Council -- Russia,
France and China -- say they are not yet convinced that an Iraqi
declaration this month failed to fully disclose any weapons of mass
destruction, in an indication that the United States might face an
uphill battle building the case for war against Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   The wait-and-see positions taken by the countries, all
veto-holding permanent members of the Security Council, contrast
sharply with President Bush's assertion last week that the
12,000-page Iraqi weapons declaration was "a long way" from meeting
the Iraqi regime's obligations.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, John D.
Negroponte, labeled Iraq's omissions "another material breach" of
U.N. resolutions but stopped short of declaring them a trigger for
war.</LD>
<TE>   Britain has also been sharply critical of Iraq's performance but
has so far not declared it a breach of the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   While not endorsing the Iraqi report, the three other permanent
members of the council are taking a restrained view and accentuating
Iraq's cooperative attitude toward U.N. weapons inspectors who have
been on the ground for the last month.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at a news conference Monday in Moscow, Russian Foreign
Minister Igor S. Ivanov seemed to rule out any attack based on the
Iraqi regime's behavior so far.</TE>
<TE>   "Any action outside the framework of Resolution 1441 ... can do
nothing but complicate the regional security situation," Ivanov said.</TE>
<TE>   Calm Is Urged</TE>
<TE>   Replying to a journalist's question about "hysteria" regarding
Iraq in the United States, Ivanov said: "Hysteria is not the best way
to resolve a problem, and therefore we will continue to work calmly"
within the U.N. process.</TE>
<TE>   The first substantial assessment by the weapons inspectors is due
Jan. 27, which is emerging as the key date for the United States
regarding whether to launch a military attack on the regime of Saddam
Hussein to force Iraqi compliance. During the next 34 days, U.S.
officials are expected to try to make the case that international
military intervention is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   But indications are that the Bush administration faces an uphill
battle to persuade the three Security Council members, who often have
been at odds with the United States over Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In Paris, experts continue to go over Iraq's declaration, while
diplomats have stuck to a carefully calibrated Iraq policy.</TE>
<TE>   They acknowledge that the Iraqi declaration suffers from serious
omissions and shortcomings but say they want the U.S. and its allies
to be focused on aggressive inspections, not preparations for an
invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats have denied reports that the French government has
decided that military action is the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "We have said that there are zones of shadow in the declaration,"
a French diplomatic source said in an interview. "There is no
question about that. But we have also said that the work of the
inspectors should be the priority. We have not entered into a logic
of military action. The defense minister has said there will be no
French military participation in an operation without the United
Nations."</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said in a statement Saturday
that war is a last resort.</TE>
<TE>   "We must try everything before going to war," he said.</TE>
<TE>   French officials insist that U.N. arms inspectors should be given
the time and the tools to do their work. Iraq's response to the
inspectors will be the measure of its cooperation, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "For France, the key of the matter, the real test, is the demand
for cooperation of Iraq," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday.
"We want to evaluate at each stage the attitude of Baghdad -- its
goodwill, its capacity to let the inspectors work in the field and
proceed with the elimination of arms of mass destruction if the
inspectors find them."</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman said that if Iraq is found to have not fully
disclosed its weapons programs, the inspectors must be able to force
Iraq to disarm.</TE>
<TE>   France pressed the United States this fall to work through the
Security Council and give inspections one more chance to force Iraq's
disarmament. France also insisted that the Security Council be
consulted again before any military strike. But France has not ruled
out participating in military action, and most analysts think the
government of President Jacques Chirac is likely to join such an
operation if it is carried out under the aegis of the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Russia shows no sign of acceding to a U.S.-led attack since Iraq
filed its report Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "There are questions that still need to be answered, but no one
really expected that all answers could be given in one document,"
said Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov. "This is what the
inspectors are for. If they have got a question but their attempts to
get an answer to it are obstructed ... then it is a violation and it
must be prevented."</TE>
<TE>   Mamedov said U.N. weapons inspectors have not complained of any
Iraqi obstruction of their work so far.</TE>
<TE>   Their statements "testify to the effectiveness of their work and
an existing opportunity to solve the problem ... by peaceful means,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   China Needs Time</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan has warned
against jumping to conclusions on the Iraqi report, saying that China
needs more time to study it and that no judgments should be made
until the inspectors have been at work longer in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A Russian political analyst, Alexander Pikayev of the Moscow
Carnegie Center, said that one of the three reluctant countries might
agree to a military operation because of U.S. pressure or its own
interests and that the rest might then feel compelled to come around.</TE>
<TE>   Pikayev said Iraq might have hurt its relations with Russia by
canceling a $3.7-billion oil contract with Russia's Lukoil recently.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite a few people in Russia have been strongly irritated," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   If the inspectors find weapons that Iraq did not report, Pikayev
said, there would be consensus for action.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of hidden Scud missiles or considerable stockpiles of
chemical or biological weapons would be enough to change Russia's
position," he said.</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Fighter Jets Down Unmanned U.S. Spy Craft</HD>
<DH>Pentagon doesn't see attack on Predator over 'no-fly' zone
as escalation of hostilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Iraqi aircraft shot down an unmanned U.S. Predator surveillance plane
Monday, marking the first time that Iraqi fighter pilots have downed
an allied aircraft over a "no-fly" zone, Pentagon officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The attack, which destroyed the remote-controlled aircraft, was
the latest in a near-constant stream of hostile exchanges between the
Iraqi military and allied air patrols in recent months.</LD>
<LD>   "They attempt to shoot down all our aircraft that fly over
southern and northern Iraq in support of the U.N. Security Council
resolutions," said Air Force Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. "They got a lucky shot today, and they brought
down the Predator."</LD>
<TE>   Both the United States and Iraq have stepped up operations in the
no-fly zones, which were established over northern and southern Iraq
after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Repeated U.S. attacks on Iraqi antiaircraft installations and
communications facilities in the zones have degraded Iraq's air
defenses, helping to create flight lanes for a potential U.S.
invasion. The United States also has dropped hundreds of thousands of
leaflets recently warning Iraqis against firing on allied planes or
repairing facilities destroyed by U.S. strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi forces have fired on U.S. aircraft more than 500 times this
year, almost always from the ground, Pentagon officials said. Iraqi
ground fire claimed two Predator planes last year, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi warplanes have ventured into the no-fly zones at least 200
times this year, a Pentagon official said.</TE>
<TE>   "The incursions are usually short and quick," he said. "As soon as
we get up, they head back."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's aging fleet of 300 or so Soviet-built MIGs is considered a
minimal threat to U.S. and British warplanes.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he did not see the
downing of the drone as an escalation.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been making a strenuous, energetic effort to shoot down
U.S. aircraft for many, many, many months now -- manned and
unmanned," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the attack Monday came at a time of mounting tension between
the U.S. and Iraq, with the U.S. military preparing to deploy as many
as 50,000 additional troops to the Gulf region in January.</TE>
<TE>   The Predator, downed over the southern no-fly zone, was part of a
fleet operated by Air Force pilots based in Kuwait. The low-flying
craft is a relatively easy target, with a wingspan of about 49 feet
and a top speed of 140 mph. Each aircraft costs $3.7 million.</TE>

<HD>Settling In for the Duration</HD>
<DH>Despite proximity to violence, West Bank Jewish communities
are expanding unabated. U.S. and others see them as an obstacle to
peace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OFRA, West Bank</DL>
<LD>The new pizza parlor in this Jewish settlement does a brisk business.</LD>
<LD>   Religious girls in long skirts push tables together and elbow each
other for a taste of the thin-crust tomato-and-cheese pies that Aron
Saban pulls from his wood-burning oven. Shy boys arrive for take-out.
Parents jiggle babies in strollers while savoring their meal -- even
as army patrols and armed guards glide by outside.</LD>
<LD>   Saban, a French Algerian Jew, moved to Ofra about 10 months ago
with his wife and infant daughter and quickly created a piece of
suburbia in the middle of a war zone. Seeing no pizzeria, he
refurbished one of Ofra's oldest houses, painted its walls powder
blue and crafted a two-chimney oven.</LD>
<TE>   He is not the only one investing in Ofra's future. Sivan Nachliel
spent tens of thousands of dollars making her new home look like
something out of Town &amp; Country magazine. Families continue moving
into a line of trailers on the outer ridge of the settlement. Another
synagogue was recently established in a far corner.</TE>
<TE>   Ofra and other Jewish settlements across the West Bank are
expanding nearly unabated, contrary to Israel's long-stated official
policy. New housing, new roads and new construction are progressively
chopping up the territory claimed by Palestinians for a future state.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the growth has occurred since the start almost 27 months
ago of a bloody era of Israeli-Palestinian fighting in which settlers
have been fair game for Palestinian gunmen. Some of the neighborhoods
that have popped up here are named in honor of residents killed in
Palestinian attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Jewish settlers see the land as their God-given legacy. Every
Israeli government for the past three decades has allowed expansion
of the settlements with few restrictions and often with overt
support. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon regards them as a strategic
imperative, a way of ensuring Israeli security by blocking contiguous
Palestinian territory.</TE>
<TE>   But Washington and most of the world view settlements as a major
obstacle to ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The
international community regards them as illegal because they were
founded on land that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   No other component of the conflict inflames Palestinians as do the
settlements, whose population has more than doubled to 225,000 --
excluding those living in Jerusalem -- since the signing of the Oslo
peace accords in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Ofra, with 2,254 people, was founded in 1975 and is one of the
oldest settlements on the West Bank. Four of its residents have been
killed in Palestinian attacks since the start of the intifada, and
ambushes on the roads around it have claimed victims from other
settlements.</TE>
<TE>   But spend some time in Ofra, and it's clear that the people who
live here are determined to hold on to their homes. They are
confident they will be allowed to do so.</TE>
<TE>   If you can suspend for just a moment the idea that you are
encamped nine miles north of Jerusalem behind barbed wire and
surrounded by hostile neighbors, Ofra is quite pleasant. Wildflowers,
peach and cherry trees, and bramble bush cover the sloping hills.
Deer are often spotted scampering about.</TE>
<TE>   Almost every male carries a gun, but children play out of doors
well into the evening, riding scooters and bikes, their parents
unconcerned. Unlike some settlements, Ofra has been spared an attack
within its boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Safe in the certainty that the many security guards will sound an
alert in the event of danger, Ofra residents often spend their nights
visiting each other's home, drinking coffee or wine, or sharing a
meal. At dusk, the muezzin's call to prayer in nearby Palestinian
villages drowns out the murmuring prayers of Jews in Ofra's two
synagogues. At night, glistening rows of streetlights crisscross Ofra
like candles poking from a skewed birthday cake.</TE>
<TE>   In a settlement where everyone knows everyone else, there is
little in the way of formal entertainment. But the Bnei Akiva youth
movement -- a kind of religious version of the Scouts -- organizes
activities for children and teens: sing-alongs, nature hikes and
camping trips.</TE>
<TE>   During the days, residents shop at a single grocery store and a
separate produce market. Boys and girls attend separate primary
schools and play soccer or volleyball. A metalworks and a carpenter
shop, two businesses that complement Ofra's building boom, provide
employment.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ofra is in many ways an island, most of its residents
leave daily to go to work or college. Many take armored buses that
run every hour or so. And teenagers, remarkably, continue to
hitchhike on Highway 60, the road outside Ofra's front gate, on which
Palestinian ambushes have claimed many Jewish lives.</TE>
<TE>   Hitchhiking seems to be part of the Ofra ethos of defiance.
Settlers have erected concrete blocks, which provide cover in case
shooting erupts, at the roadside stop where people wait for rides.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother trusts me. I know which cars to pick," said 13-year-old
Morit Shelem, who says she hitchhikes with her parents' blessing.</TE>
<TE>   Settlers live in a place like Ofra for many reasons. Some like the
fact that housing is cheap and the lifestyle is rural. Some are drawn
by ideology or by religious beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here for Zionism," says Saban, the pizza man. "And it's not
just Ofra. All the settlements -- it's important to strengthen them."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Smadar, acknowledged a degree of anxiety at their choice
of home. But overcoming fear is the pillar of claiming the land, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "If everyone succumbed to their fears, we'd lose half the
country," she said. "We don't have that freedom."</TE>
<TE>   The Sabans also were attracted to Ofra by some of the same
incentives that have lured newlywed couples, young families and
recent immigrants -- Russians, Ethiopians, even Peruvians -- to
dozens of settlements on the West Bank. Low rents, subsidized
housing, incredibly easy-term mortgages and other government-provided
benefits and freebies make it much cheaper to live in a settlement
than in the average Israeli town or city.</TE>
<TE>   Smadar says they could not have afforded to open their business in
Jerusalem. But living just a few miles away in Ofra means they can
have a home and their business.</TE>
<TE>   Aron, 25 and bearded, bakes pizza on stones that he brought from
France. Smadar, 24, is dressed as an observant Jewish woman, but with
flair: a long black skirt, fur-trimmed sweater and a head covering
that braids stylishly into her own hair. She wants to design
fashionable clothing for religious women.</TE>
<TE>   Ofra calls itself a religious settlement, which means everyone
observes the Sabbath strictly and keeps kosher. But while every man
wears a kippa, the women reflect gradations of the dress code. Some
wear pants, others don't cover their heads. It creates a feeling of
tolerance and flexibility -- within bounds.</TE>
<TE>   Settler leaders openly say their plan is to establish a string of
outposts southward along the stony hilltops here that will eventually
link them to settlements ringing northern Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   While successive Israeli officials have assured American
presidents that there are no plans to expand settlements, the reality
on the ground is quite different.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 40 to 60 outposts -- the first step in expanding a
settlement -- have been established throughout the West Bank since
Sharon took office 21 months ago, according to both Peace Now, an
Israeli group that opposes settlements, and the Defense Ministry.
Hilltop positions serve as lookouts to help protect the roads Israel
constructs largely for settlers to travel on.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon is among Israel's biggest champions of the "settlement
enterprise," the notion of seizing control of land to extend Israel's
reach as deeply as possible into territory that some see as historic
Palestine and others, the biblical Land of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The West Bank is basically the shape of a kidney bean, with
Jerusalem at the indentation. Settlements are gradually dissecting it
east to west in at least two places north of Jerusalem, while also
slicing it north-to-south along Highway 60, the spine of the West
Bank. Settlements also are on track to form a ring around Jerusalem
that would separate the contested city from the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Settlements often start as nothing more than a water tower and a
trailer. Then an army unit is dispatched to guard them, and over a
period of months permanent housing replaces temporary shelters. In
Ofra and in most other settlements, houses are nearly uniform, white
with red roofs and lined up in neat rows. Many settlements have
schools, industrial parks, their own cemeteries.</TE>
<TE>   Each new community makes a contiguous, viable Palestinian state
less likely and, to Palestinian minds, belies any Israeli claim of
wanting to solve the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The settlements are controversial in Israel, too. A slight
majority of Israelis wants to be rid of them, according to polls. In
addition to the implications for Palestinian-Israeli relations, cost
is an issue. Israel spends hundreds of millions of dollars to build
and protect settlements, even though the country is mired in economic
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Debate over the $140 million allocated in this year's budget to
the nearly 150 settlements helped trigger the fall of Sharon's
coalition government and new elections scheduled for Jan. 28. Critics
argue that millions more are funneled into settlements in hidden
funding.</TE>
<TE>   In varying degrees, U.S. governments have long opposed the
settlements, too. U.S. Ambassador Daniel Kurtzer approached a senior
Israeli official four times in the last year to protest their
expansion, with maps of the growth in hand, according to sources
familiar with the contact.</TE>
<TE>   Each time, the government assured Kurtzer that settlements were
only accommodating "natural growth," even though much of that comes
from active recruitment and many houses sit empty while construction
continues. Recruitment helps fuel a population growth among settlers
that last year was four times the rate among other Israelis,
according to government statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor of Ariel, for example, is inviting teachers from Russia
to live in the second-largest Jewish settlement in the West Bank;
fundamentalist Christians also are paying to relocate Jews from
America to the settlements.</TE>
<TE>   A senior aide to then-Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, the
recipient of Kurtzer's entreaties, said limiting the growth of
settlements was simply not a priority at a time of war.</TE>
<TE>   Yossi Rund, a 51-year-old beekeeper, has lived in Ofra almost from
the start. His eldest daughter was born on an anniversary of its
founding and is named after the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Haya, are true believers in what settlers see as
their manifest destiny. The real trouble began, they say, when
Palestinians thought the autonomy they gained in the 1980s and '90s
meant they could control the land as opposed to simply control their
daily lives. That, the Runds contend, was never the idea; the land is
ours.</TE>
<TE>   Their determination was tested on June 6 when their son Erez, 18,
was shot dead, probably by Palestinian gunmen, as he drove home from
exams at his school in a settlement just north of here.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I thought I would lose faith in God," Yossi said, his
eyes reddened and hollowed by sadness. "He was such a pure boy. I try
to do all that the Torah asks us to do. I am not evil. But to be
punished by the murder of this boy?"</TE>
<TE>   Erez, with tousled hair, wire-rim glasses and a crooked smile, was
enormously popular among the teens of Ofra, many of whom he counseled
and led in the Bnei Akiva youth movement. His friends still come to
the Rund household to sing songs and reminisce.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Yossi said, tragedy only reinforced his faith and his
will to remain. As he spoke, he showed a visitor a family tree dating
back to the 19th century. Many in the family were represented by
yellow Stars of David; those are the ones killed in the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a picnic. It's a war," he said. "The war took my son.
When everyone realizes that this is a war, we will win it."</TE>
<TE>   Yossi and his wife say they trust God to protect them and so they
do not use the armored buses or flak jackets others use when they
leave the settlement. (A couple of weeks after he was interviewed, he
was shot and wounded while driving on Highway 60 a short distance
from where his son was killed.)</TE>
<TE>   The Ben Ari family, on the other hand, is careful to put on the
vests, have their Uzi and army-issue assault rifle always at hand,
and restrict trips off the settlement to necessities such as dental
appointments. Ofra has two doctors but no dentist.</TE>
<TE>   Ayelet and Netanel Ben Ari, and their two children, Roni, 5, and
Matan, 2, are one of two families and about 15 young adults living in
16 trailers along a ridge half a mile south of the center of Ofra.</TE>
<TE>   Theirs is a new neighborhood, Ginot Aryeh -- or Aryeh's Gardens --
named for Ofra resident Aryeh Hershkowitz, killed on Jan. 29, 2001,
when his car came under fire as he drove from the settlement. (His
30-year-old son Assaf was killed in almost identical circumstances
three months later.)</TE>
<TE>   The Ben Aris arrived at Ginot Aryeh last year from another
settlement. Initially, Ayelet, a schoolteacher, resisted the move.
She was tired of living in trailers, the first stop of many a
settler. She was ready for a real roof, a real floor. But Netanel, an
out-of-work computer programmer, convinced her Ofra would be
different.</TE>
<TE>   With generous, tax-subsidized help from the Ofra leadership, they
were able to spruce up their new home. They welded two trailers
together, producing a two-bedroom home with den and computer room;
put in linoleum tiling; installed a new kitchen; tacked screens to
the windows; and painted inside and out.</TE>
<TE>   They say they have been assured that Ginot Aryeh soon will be
formally incorporated into Ofra, which means paved streets and houses
will replace gravel paths and trailers.</TE>
<TE>   As a settlement evolves into permanency, the army shares its
security duties with well-armed patrols made up of residents.</TE>
<TE>   Azriel Simhone, who has lived in Ofra for 26 years, is one of its
security guards. With an M-16 slung across his back -- one 29-bullet
magazine loaded, another affixed at the ready -- and a pistol on his
hip, Simhone mans the guard booth at Ofra's entrance just off Highway
60 and also patrols the roads, valleys and hills that make up the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The job is "more intense" now than it was two years ago, before
the latest Palestinian uprising, he said. "There are more people
doing more things in more places, around the clock. It takes a lot of
energy."</TE>
<TE>   To Simhone, the West Bank was still in its biblical state of
shepherds, oxen and goats as recently as the 1960s and '70s, when
Jewish settlers, reclaiming a legacy two millenniums old, arrived and
brought modernity.</TE>
<TE>   Peace could be possible with the older generation of Arabs, he
said; it's the younger, demanding ones who are full of unrealistic
hopes.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to the simple Arab, we can live in peace, we have
in the past and we can again," he said. "The older generation of
Arabs saw things better. They never expected to rule, they expected
us to rule. With them, we can live in peace."</TE>
<TE>   At the guard booth, where the glass is bulletproof, Simhone eyes
every car that approaches before pushing a button that raises the
yellow metal arm. If he doesn't recognize the driver and occupants,
the car does not enter.</TE>
<TE>   As it grows, Ofra is gradually coming nose to nose with the
Palestinian villages that flank it: Ein Yabrud, over the highway to
the west, and Taibe, a Christian town, across a valley to the east.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we can afford it, we will expand," Simhone said. "Our
concept is that every life that they kill, we build more.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to decide, is this Israel, or not? And if it is, we must
build everywhere, and if they object, we throw them out."</TE>
<TE>   Ideology is a main motivation for Simhone and many like him. But
so is lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Sivan Nachliel sought the small-town feel of Ofra, plus the
financial breaks that allowed her to decorate her home to the hilt:
faux-marble tiles, terra-cotta inlays, a designer kitchen with
granite countertops, a small movie theater upstairs, a Japanese
bonsai tree in the living room, where lithographs from a renowned
Israeli artist hang.</TE>
<TE>   Hers is the last occupied house on a new road, which continues
downhill carved in red dirt, where more houses will be built.</TE>
<TE>   Nachliel, an English teacher, and her husband, a traveling
salesman, spent about $150,000 on the house and moved in four months
ago, after initially renting elsewhere in the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   She says she loves living in Ofra, in part because it feels so
safe for her children. Where else can her first-grader put on his
helmet and ride his bike to school by himself?</TE>
<TE>   And if her sizable investment goes up in smoke -- if Ofra is
dismantled in a future deal to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict -- then so be it. Many expect government compensation if
that day arrives.</TE>
<TE>   "If a government tells me to leave my house because it will bring
peace, then I will go. I will not sit on the roof and fight," said
Nachliel, 36. "If God tells me my leaving will bring peace, fine.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't think that will happen. And if it does, at least in
the meantime I'll be living comfortably."</TE>

<HD>Slow Sales Dim Hopes for Retailers</HD>
<DH>Increase in holiday spending is forecast to be the lowest
on record, despite deep discounts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest and Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bright sales season is all but a fanciful Christmas wish for the
nation's retailers as Americans pulled back on their holiday shopping
last week despite the lure of deep discounts.</LD>
<LD>   After a promising start in late November, retail sales during the
final week before Christmas fell an estimated 6% from the previous
year. Holiday sales in 2002 are now expected to post the smallest
growth on record, according to a new industry report Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Although official government figures won't be available until next
month, the disappointing sales were confirmed Monday by some of the
nation's biggest retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Target and
Federated Department Stores. FAO Inc., the parent of toy retailers
FAO Schwarz and Zany Brainy, said it would be shuttering as many as
70 stores, in part because of poor holiday sales.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a very bad trend to see in these numbers," said Mike
Niemira, a senior economist with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, who
lowered his growth forecast for holiday sales to a measly 1.5% -- the
lowest since at least 1970, when record-keeping began. The figures
are for sales at stores open at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   Even if shoppers flocked to the malls for the post-Christmas
bargain hunt, Niemira said, it probably would not be enough to help
pull this season out for retailers. "I think it's a little bit late,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The sluggish holiday shopping portends trouble for the broader
economy, which has been held up by hearty consumer spending even in
the face of a jobless recovery and declining growth in personal
incomes. Weak holiday sales mean fewer tax dollars for
budget-strapped states such as California, and they could get the
nation's economy off on bad footing next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically we have just one horse," said Sung Won Sohn, the
Minneapolis-based chief economist for Wells Fargo &amp; Co. "If that one
horse gets sick, not only the U.S. economy but the global economy
will be in deep trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Although Saturday was, as usual, the busiest shopping day of the
year thus far, sales dropped off sharply Sunday, a volatile pattern
that has typified the current shopping season. California shoppers
outspent the national average despite wetter-than-usual weather, and
residents of the Northeast were the week's biggest spenders.</TE>
<TE>   There is a chance that retailers could get a boost in the days
after Christmas, when shoppers are expected to return to stores with
presents of cash and gift certificates and be greeted with even more
dramatic sales and bargains. But the latest numbers indicate that it
will be "exceedingly hard" for the season to make a comeback, Niemira
said.</TE>
<TE>   Retail sales are of particular concern to economists this year
because the nation is in the early stages of recovery from a
recession that began in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But some said it's too early to count out U.S. consumers, who have
carried the economy on their shoulders since the burst of the tech
bubble and the collapse of business investment. Government data
released Monday showed that consumer spending in November rose a
solid 0.5% from the previous month.</TE>
<TE>   The big question, though, is whether American shoppers can
continue to carry the load until companies start investing again.</TE>
<TE>   Economists have been counting on business spending to help refuel
the recovery, but retailers won't be buying if profits are too lean
-- or nonexistent -- said Scott Hoyt, director of consumer economics
at Economy.com, an economic consulting house in West Chester, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   "If companies are making money, they can afford to hire people, to
invest in capital equipment, to do the kinds of spending we expect to
push the economy forward as we move through next year," he said.
"Without profits, they're not going to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Retailers' immediate goal is to rid their stores of holiday goods.
If they can't do that, they won't reorder as much in January, and the
effect will ripple across other sectors of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Manufacturers don't have to manufacture, transportation companies
don't have to transport the goods. So when it's sold does matter,"
Hoyt said. "The bigger picture is beyond the retail industry."</TE>
<TE>   The upshot for consumers is that, despite already steep price
cuts, more markdowns are on the way, said Marshal Cohen, co-president
of NPD FashionWorld, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "The post-holiday sales are going to have to be even more dramatic
than the pre-holiday sales, and that's going to mean volume, but at
very low margins," Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   If profits are disappointing, industry insiders say, some
companies that operate a large number of stores may spend the first
part of 2003 deciding which ones to close. These companies include
San Francisco-based Gap Inc. -- the nation's largest specialty
retailer and parent of the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains.</TE>
<TE>   Gap, which operates 4,100 stores, typically closes 70 to 80
locations during the normal course of business each year, spokeswoman
Stacy MacLean said. The company said last month that it expected to
close more stores than usual next year. MacLean declined to comment
on December sales and said there was no reason to think at this point
that Gap would close more stores because of holiday sales results.</TE>
<TE>   Weekly sales estimates by ShopperTrak RCT, a Chicago area firm
that tracks retail activity, showed that Saturday's sales were $7.2
billion, a respectable 4.5% increase compared with the year before.
But on Sunday, sales were 1.9% lower than last year.</TE>
<TE>   People involved with the survey speculated that would-be shoppers
may have opted instead to see "The Lord of the Rings: The Two
Towers," which enjoyed the biggest December opening of any movie
ever, or headed out of town for family gatherings.</TE>
<TE>   A survey of 1,000 consumers showed that 45.4% of Americans shopped
over the last weekend, 10 percentage points below what retailers were
hoping for, according to America's Research Group in Charleston, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Saturday before Christmas typically is the biggest
shopping day of the year, some retail watchers think the Saturday
after Christmas will be even bigger this year.</TE>
<TE>   The week after Christmas typically generates 10% of holiday sales,
said Scott Krugman, spokesman for the National Retail Federation.</TE>
<TE>   "You can almost call it a fifth quarter," he said. "It provides
retailers with another opportunity to make sales, giving them more
customers, more traffic."</TE>
<TE>   But with Christmas falling on Wednesday this year, many people
will be back on the job -- not in stores -- on Thursday and Friday,
Krugman said.</TE>
<TE>   In analyzing what consumers might do next, there's reason for both
concern and optimism, according to a recent report by Economy.com.</TE>
<TE>   Wage gains, though weak, have been improving, and disposable
income growth is healthy. In addition, shoppers have more money to
spend after refinancing their homes, and both interest rates and
inflation remain low.</TE>
<TE>   But consumers' wealth levels have decreased and debt levels have
swelled. And, after years of hearty spending, there's a shortage of
pent-up demand, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   The most likely scenario, the report concludes, is "moderate
spending and retail sales growth sufficient, though barely, to keep
the economy moving forward until business activity picks up."</TE>
<TE>   In California, the unemployment rate, which stood at 6.4% in
November, is relatively low compared with previous recessions. Still,
the loss of high-paying technology jobs and the evaporation of stock
market gains has socked the state much harder than the rest of the
nation in terms of income.</TE>
<TE>   From the first quarter of 2001 through the third quarter of this
year, personal income in the U.S. grew by 3.9%, compared with a 0.5%
slide in California, according to figures from the UCLA Anderson
Forecast.</TE>
<TE>   That drop can be seen at the cash registers, where taxable sales
are predicted to fall by 3.3% this year to $426.9 billion. Sales
taxes are the state's second-biggest source of revenue after personal
income tax. Thus, the decline is one of the main reasons California
is facing a $30-billion-plus budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as 2000, annual taxable sales in California soared by
11.9% to $441.9 billion, led by the highflying San Francisco Bay
Area. But the region has fallen hard in the bust.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent data available from the State Board of
Equalization show that Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon
Valley, saw its taxable sales plunge 14% in 2001. The county has lost
more than 110,000 jobs from its pre-recession peak, positions that
aren't expected to come back any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   "My sense is that it's going to be a really grim Christmas in the
Bay Area," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles
County Economic Development Corp. "And that's going to be a drag on
the whole state."</TE>

<KH>JOE STRUMMER: 1952-2002</KH>
<HD>Founder of the Clash Propelled Punk Rock Into the
Mainstream</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Cromelin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rock musician Joe Strummer, whose band the Clash helped bring punk
rock into the mainstream and expanded the genre's artistic range,
died Sunday of a heart attack at his home in Broomfield, Somerset,
England. He was 50.</LD>
<LD>   Like Bob Dylan with folk music and the Beatles with early rock 'n'
roll, the Clash took the raw material of punk rock and made it a
vehicle for ambitious artistry, giving the music a future beyond the
hard-core underground.</LD>
<LD>   In their 1979 landmark album "London Calling," they linked punk's
raw energy with rockabilly, blues, pop and jazz roots. The move
risked rejection by their audience but opened new vistas for bands.
In the process, they went from rowdy rebels to one of the foundations
of rock.</LD>
<TE>   Responding to Strummer's death, U2's Bono called the Clash "the
greatest rock band," adding, "They wrote the book for U2."</TE>
<TE>   The Clash's influence resonated in the music of Nirvana and the
other grunge bands that shaped rock in the '90s, and today's rock
radio playlists are packed with groups that follow the Clash
blueprint of social commentary delivered in unvarnished, aggressive
form.</TE>
<TE>   That's a far cry from punk's original position as a noisy irritant
to the staid music industry of the 1970s, when major record companies
and radio stations ignored the music. The growing popularity of the
Clash was key in breaking down that door, opening the field for acts
such as Offspring and Green Day.</TE>
<TE>   A recent concert celebrating punk rock's legacy, headlined by the
reunited Sex Pistols, drew about 30,000 fans to Glen Helen
Blockbuster Pavilion in Devore. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame began
welcoming the punk generation last year, when it inducted the
Ramones. The Clash was named to the hall last month and is scheduled
to be inducted on March 10 in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the Sex Pistols' Johnny Rotten and the Ramones' Joey
Ramone, the ragged-voiced, snaggletoothed Strummer was one of the
archetypal figures of the punk movement.</TE>
<TE>   All were instrumental in punk's revitalizing of popular music, but
while the Pistols quickly flamed out and the Ramones remained
benignly cartoonish, the Clash conducted an eventful, decade-long
career during which Strummer, who savored the role of outsider, saw
his band become one of the most commercially successful of the
punk-rock generation.</TE>
<TE>   Strummer was born John Graham Mellor in 1952 in Ankara, Turkey,
where his father worked for England's foreign service. He also lived
in Egypt, Mexico and Germany before attending boarding school in
England. Strummer started his music career busking in London's
subways, and in the mid-'70s, he led a pub-rock band called the
101ers, playing in an early rock 'n' roll style.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by the Sex Pistols in the ferment of London's punk-rock
explosion in 1976, Strummer formed the Clash with another
singer-guitarist, Mick Jones, and bassist Paul Simonon. Guitarist
Keith Levene and drummer Terry Chimes were in the original lineup,
but Levene soon quit. Chimes would be replaced by Topper Headon in
late 1976.</TE>
<TE>   The Clash opened for the Pistols on the famed "Anarchy in the
U.K." tour and signed with CBS Records in 1977. Their U.S. label,
Columbia, considered their debut album, "The Clash," too raw to
release here, though it's said to be the best-selling import album
ever, with sales of more than 100,000. The company eventually
released the album in late 1978, after putting out "Give 'Em Enough
Rope" earlier the same year.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the Sex Pistols' nihilistic view of "No Future,"
fiery anthems such as "White Riot" and "I'm So Bored With the U.S.A."
captured the discontent of their generation and sought to spur their
peers to action.</TE>
<TE>   "The ideals that still motivate me as an artist come not from
punk, not even from the Clash, but from Joe Strummer," English
singer-songwriter Billy Bragg wrote in an appreciation on the BBC
News Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "Were it not for the Clash, punk would have been just a sneer, a
safety pin and a pair of bondage trousers. Instead, the incendiary
lyrics of the Clash inspired 1,000 more bands on both sides of the
Atlantic to spring up and challenge their elders, and the man that we
all looked to was Joe Strummer."</TE>
<TE>   But being categorized as a "political band" didn't always sit well
with Strummer, one of rock's most colorful and candid figures, and
one who resisted being pigeonholed.</TE>
<TE>   "I often felt that all got a bit unbalanced," he said, looking
back on the Clash legacy in a 1988 interview. "I kept trying to
stress that -- 'Hang on, we're bebop guys.... We're not in there with
John Reed and "Ten Days That Shook the World." ' ... I often felt
worried that people thought we were Che Guevara."</TE>
<TE>   The Clash was an unstoppable force on stage, with Strummer
delivering his vocals like a blowtorch and the music inspiring
anarchic scenes on the dance floors. The band's artistic breakthrough
came in 1979 with "London Calling," which expanded the punk
vocabulary. It reached No. 27 on the U.S. chart, and was named in
many critics' polls as the best album of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The Clash responded to their success with an anti-commercial
gesture, a three-album collection called "Sandinista!" Released in
1980, it was a sprawling, eclectic set that introduced funk and
hip-hop elements to the repertoire of the Clash, a band that had
always had a soft spot for reggae and other forms of "rebel music."
In 1982, the more cohesive "Combat Rock" made the Top 10, and
included the hits "Combat Rock" (written by Headon) and "Should I
Stay or Should I Go?"</TE>
<TE>   But things were unraveling. Headon was fired because of his heroin
habit, a move that Strummer later pinpointed as the beginning of the
end for the Clash. In 1983, Strummer and Simonon threw Jones out of
the band.</TE>
<TE>   Strummer led a new lineup in a final Clash album, 1985's "Cut the
Crap," then kept a low profile for several years, releasing a solo
album in 1989 but concentrating on movie scoring and acting in such
films as Alex Cox's "Straight to Hell" and Jim Jarmusch's "Mystery
Train."</TE>
<TE>   After clearing himself of Clash-era contractual obligations in
1997, Strummer formed the Mescaleros, which released two albums on
L.A.-based Hellcat Records. The sound blended rock with world-music
grooves and electronics. Strummer and the band had been working on a
third Mescaleros album, but a Hellcat spokesman said Monday that a
decision about its release will be made later.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation about a possible Clash reunion had increased in
anticipation of the upcoming Hall of Fame induction and in the wake
of a recent teaming on stage of Strummer and Jones at a Mescaleros
show.</TE>
<TE>   "I never say never about nothing," he said in a 1999 interview.
"But I'm not going to re-form for money. The only thing that would
make it happen is if Topper Headon got off heroin and the four of us
got some tunes together and started to hang out and had a reason to
believe in each other.... There's no way we're going to suddenly snap
back into life because some guy's written a check."</TE>
<TE>   Strummer is survived by his wife, Lucinda, two daughters and a
stepdaughter.</TE>

<HD>Missile Plan Faces Obstacles</HD>
<DH>Pentagon sees value in Bush's proposal to deploy the system
in three years. But critics say an essential phase of testing would
be left out.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>If there is one thing on which missile defense advocates and critics
agree, it's that the technology isn't ready yet. Where they differ is
on whether the technology will be "ready enough" three years from now
to meet President Bush's accelerated deployment plan announced last
week.</LD>
<LD>   Even under the Pentagon's best-case scenario, the missile defense
system expected to be fielded by the end of 2005 will be able to
shoot down no more than 20 incoming enemy rockets before all
available interceptor missiles are spent. And that assumes
jury-rigged radars function flawlessly, the weather is cooperative,
half-tested missiles don't err and the enemy doesn't use decoys or
other tricks.</LD>
<LD>   That's a far cry from Ronald Reagan's dream of a missile defense
"astrodome" protecting the United States, but defense officials are
optimistic.</LD>
<TE>   "We think that this modest and initial capability is both
warranted, but will also be very, very useful," J. D. Crouch,
assistant secretary of Defense for international security, said when
plans were unveiled last week.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's order to field the missile defense system in the next three
years forces what has been a developmental program to suddenly --
some say prematurely -- become a deployment program, skipping an
entire phase of testing.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, new weapon systems go through two phases of
testing: developmental, in which technology is tested piece by piece
under controlled conditions; and operational, in which the pieces are
put together and tried out in the real world.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the ground-based interceptors at the center of the missile
defense system have undergone only eight of at least 19 planned
developmental tests. Of those, five were successful.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials say five out of eight is good for a weapon
system at this stage of development. Critics say it's not good enough
to skip the operational phase and move directly to deployment.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, you don't deploy until you're done with developmental
testing and operational testing," said Lisbeth Gronlund of the Union
of Concerned Scientists. She contended that the Pentagon is setting
aside its ordinary standards to rush the missile defense system's
deployment: "If this were a tank or a gun, you couldn't do this."</TE>
<TE>   The technological challenges facing the program are daunting.
Pentagon officials say the best way to learn is by doing. Critics
counter that expensive mistakes will draw money and energy from more
practical steps that would provide more security. (The Pentagon has
secured $16 billion over the next two years to fund the missile
defense system and is seeking an addition $1.5 billion.)</TE>
<TE>   Fears Over Delay</TE>
<TE>   Even some missile defense proponents worry that speeding
deployment of a flawed, rudimentary missile defense program could
delay development of a better, more reliable system.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than developing the kind of system that might work,
there's a risk we will get discouraged by a system that doesn't work
and decide to call the whole thing off," said John Isaacs, president
of the Council for a Livable World, which opposes the deployment.</TE>
<TE>   Even supporters admit that deployment within three years will be a
challenge. In some ways, it is even more ambitious than the 1960s
space race. Instead of trying to get one rocket to the moon, the
system will have to have many rockets and missiles and radars -- most
still under development -- all working well and in concert. If the
system fails, it won't be a crew dying; it could be thousands, even
millions, of people.</TE>
<TE>   "There is less margin of error here," Isaacs said.</TE>
<TE>   To meet Bush's timetable, the Pentagon will have to speed
development of new equipment, and jury-rig other systems.</TE>
<TE>   There are three main parts to a ground-based missile defense
system. The first is interceptor missiles, which home in on a target
to destroy it. The second is booster rockets, to put the interceptor
missiles into the atmosphere. The third is radars and other sensors,
to detect and track an enemy missile through its trajectory.</TE>
<TE>   The most developed technology is the interceptors, which are
equipped with radars that help them hit and destroy the target.
Pentagon planners refer to the technology as a "bullet hitting a
bullet," and most of the tests to date have focused on making that
work.</TE>
<TE>   During a Pentagon briefing last week, missile defense agency
director Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish showed impressive footage of
interceptor tests, with missiles streaming through the air, adjusting
their trajectories and striking the target with a puff of smoke and
debris.</TE>
<TE>   But critics point out that the tests are highly scripted, and
nonetheless have been successful only five out of eight tries.</TE>
<TE>   "That statistic is misleading because the tests have been a bit
artificial," said James Lindsay, a missile defense expert at the
Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   More troublesome, experts say, are the other two pieces of the
technology: the boosters and the radars.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Pentagon has not developed a booster rocket that can
carry the missile into the atmosphere fast enough. The tests have
been conducted on modified Minuteman missiles, but they are too slow
for anything except tests. After a booster rocket tested earlier this
year failed, the Pentagon began developing a second, parallel rocket,
in case the kinks in the first can't be fixed in time.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like where we are in terms of being developed with the
boosters. That is a fact. Everybody knows that," Kadish acknowledged
to reporters this week. He vowed to make progress on the problem in
the coming year: "Calendar year '03 is the year of the ground-based
booster."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the thorniest challenge will be piecing together a radar
and sensor system that will be able to identify and track incoming
missiles and allow military officers to figure out which interceptors
to use and where to send them.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, the Pentagon wants to put in place a ground-based radar
system known as "X-band," a low-wavelength radar sensitive enough to
distinguish decoy missiles from warheads. It also wants to deploy a
space-based infrared system, known as "SBIR-high," to replace the
existing and aging early-warning satellite system. And it wants to
add lower-orbit infrared sensor satellites, known as "SBIR-low," to
improve the system's tracking ability.</TE>
<TE>   These systems are under development but are years away from
deployment. So, to support the early missile defense deployment, the
Pentagon plans to upgrade and employ existing radar systems.</TE>
<TE>   First, the military plans to upgrade a Cold War-era radar on
Shemya Island in the far western Aleutian Islands of Alaska, called
the Cobra-Dane radar. Lt. Col. Rick Leonard, spokesman for the
missile defense agency, said new computers and software will be
installed so the radar system can handle the volume of lightning-fast
calculations needed for a missile defense system.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the United States has asked Great Britain and Denmark
for permission to upgrade similar radars on their territories -- at
Fylingdales Royal Air Force Base in England and at Thule Air Force
Base in northern Greenland. That request is under review in both
countries.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard said the three radars would together provide adequate
coverage to operate the initial missile defense system. Critics
disagree. They claim the radars will be unable to distinguish decoy
missiles from warheads, which could cause the U.S. to waste precious
interceptors on easy-to-launch fakes. And they say the Cold War-era
radars are pointed in less-than-optimal directions -- Cobra-Dane
toward the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka, about 1,000 miles west of
Shemya Island; and the British and Danish radars toward the polar
routes that Soviet missiles were expected to take.</TE>
<TE>   The critics contend that as a result, the missile defense system
will likely be adequate against a threat from North Korea, but would
be essentially useless against a ballistic missile launched from a
Middle Eastern country, such as Iraq or Iran, which would probably be
aimed at East Coast population centers.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard said the planned system would be adequate against all
"anticipated" threats from the Middle East -- that is, no Middle
Eastern country has yet developed ballistic missiles that could reach
U.S. territory. The system could not protect against a country or
group that managed to acquire missiles from somewhere else, however.</TE>
<TE>   "The near-term threat we have to focus on is North Korea," Leonard
said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, despite Pentagon claims that the rudimentary
ground-based missile defense would be able to protect all 50 states,
critics say the planned initial deployment leaves Hawaii with little
or no coverage.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the missile defense agency plans to install the first
X-band radar on an oil rig platform, so it can be moved around the
ocean to provide necessary coverage. Plans call for the floating
radar to go on line in late 2005.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the missile defense agency intends to outfit Navy
cruisers with Aegis sensor systems designed to track and intercept
short- and medium-range missiles. In the next three years, they also
will be outfitted with 20 interceptor missiles. The Pentagon says the
Aegis cruisers will be "forward deployed" in the Pacific Ocean, where
they should be able to knock out ballistic missiles during the
initial "boost" phase of launch. Presumably, the strategy is to
increase the protection of Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Critics Concerned</TE>
<TE>   Even if all of this is assembled as planned, critics worry that it
will be easy to knock out with decoy missiles, balloons or other
"countermeasures."</TE>
<TE>   "The capability that we're postulating right now will be capable
against the countermeasures we expect in the time frame that we're
talking about," said Kadish, the missile defense agency director.
"And then we will move rapidly to improve that capability.... We're
going to be very, very aggressive in this area."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the situation is similar to deciding whether a glass
is half full or half empty. Both are true.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has developed the technology to the point where it is
possible to put something in the field in the next three years. But
the question remains whether that something is better than nothing.</TE>
<TE>   As Lindsay of Brookings put it: "When they say 'modest
capability,' the emphasis is on 'modest.' "</TE>

<LD>A commuter plane carrying Ukrainian and Russian aerospace scientists
crashed in central Iran on Monday, killing all 46 people aboard,
Iranian officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The passengers were traveling to Iran to witness the maiden flight
of a joint Ukrainian- and Iranian-built passenger plane, according to

<LD>   The plane crashed near the town of Baqerabad while preparing to
make a scheduled landing at its destination, an airport near the
central Iranian city of Esfahan, about 220 miles south of Tehran.</LD>
<TE>   Reza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman at the state-owned Iran Aircraft
Manufacturing Industries in Esfahan, said all aboard were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Mykola Melnikov, a duty officer at the Ukrainian Emergency
Situations Ministry, said the plane that crashed was probably a
Ukrainian-built Antonov-140.</TE>
<TE>   Iranian TV said the scientists were traveling to Iran to attend a
test flight Wednesday of the Iran-140 passenger plane being built in
Esfahan. The plane is based on the Ukrainian-designed Antonov-140, a
twin-propeller turboprop used for short-range commuter flights.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear to whom the plane belonged.</TE>
<TE>   Melnikov said the plane took off from Kharkiv, Ukraine, early
Monday afternoon with a delegation of officials from the Kharkiv
aircraft plant, which built the plane in which they were flying.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's Anatolia news agency said the plane was traveling from
Ukraine to Esfahan, stopping en route to refuel in the Turkish Black
Sea city of Trabzon. No passengers boarded or got off the plane
there.</TE>
<TE>   The Antonov-140 is a short-range transport aircraft first flown in
1997 and designed to carry 46 to 52 people. Parts for it are made at
the Esfahan aviation industries plant with Ukrainian assistance.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 12, 119 passengers and crew died aboard Iranian Airlines
Flight 956 when it slammed into a mountain near the city of
Khorramabad, about 230 miles southwest of Tehran.</TE>

<LD>Here are excerpts from Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld's
briefing.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   The moment [Iraqi President] Saddam [Hussein] and his ruling
clique seem to feel that they're out of danger, they will undoubtedly
see no incentive to comply with their international obligations. That
is why, after the passage of Resolution 1441, the U.S. and coalition
countries are continuing to take steps to keep pressure on the
regime.</LD>
<TE>   Among other things, we've continued patrolling the skies over the
north and south "no-fly" zones. We've continued developing a
humanitarian relief and reconstruction plan for a post-Saddam Hussein
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   We've continued working with the Iraqi opposition. We've taken
steps to prepare for a post-Saddam transition. And we're continuing
to work with friends and allies to keep the military pressure on
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We're taking prudent and deliberate steps with respect to alerts
and mobilizations and deployment of U.S. forces: active, Guard and
Reserve.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   None of these steps reflect a decision by the president or the
United Nations or anyone else, to my knowledge, to use force. The
president has not made such a decision. Rather, they are intended to
support the diplomatic efforts that are underway, to enhance force
protection in the region and elsewhere in the world, including the
United States, and to make clear to the Iraqi regime ... that they
need to comply with their U.N. obligations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have no reason to believe that you're correct that North Korea
feels emboldened because of the world's interest in Iraq. If they do,
it would be a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We are capable of fighting two major regional conflicts, as the
national strategy and the force-sizing construct clearly indicates.
We're capable of winning decisively in one and swiftly defeating in
the case of the other. And let there be no doubt about it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ... The leadership of the country [North Korea] is currently
repressing its people, starving its people, has large numbers of its
people in concentration camps, driving people to try to leave the
country through China and other methods, starving these people. Their
economy is in the tank. People at all levels are unhappy with that
leadership.... The idea that it's the rhetoric from the United States
that's causing them to starve their people or to do these idiotic
things, or to try to build a nuclear power plant. They don't need a
nuclear power plant. Their power grid couldn't even absorb that.</TE>
<TE>   If you look at a picture from the sky of the Korean peninsula at
night, South Korea is filled with lights and energy and vitality and
a booming economy; North Korea is dark.</TE>

<HD>Ivorian Rebels Threaten French</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>This country's rebel factions threw down the gauntlet to France on
Monday, saying any attack by the former colonial ruler on rebel
positions would trigger an all-out offensive.</LD>
<LD>   The rebel groups met Monday in Bouake, the stronghold of the main
Patriotic Movement of Ivory Coast faction, or MPCI, to discuss
forming an alliance -- two days after French troops blasted three
rebel pickup trucks attacking a town in the west.</LD>
<LD>   Frightened refugees fled the scene of the latest clashes, joining
tens of thousands already forced from their homes by a war that has
increasingly split Ivory Coast along ethnic lines since a failed
Sept. 19 coup.</LD>
<TE>   The MPCI rebels signed a truce in October and began talks in
neighboring Togo with government negotiators. But these have brought
little sign of a deal, and the emergence of two new factions last
month shattered the cease-fire in the world's top cocoa grower.</TE>
<TE>   The Ivorian Popular Movement of the Far West, or MPIGO, and the
Movement for Peace and Justice, or MJP, launched attacks on towns in
the western cocoa-growing belt and advanced south toward French
troops dug in at the key junction town of Duekoue.</TE>
<TE>   But the MPIGO's attack was halted by French troops Saturday when
they opened fire to stop the rebels, effectively holding the line for
President Laurent Gbagbo's mercenary-backed forces.</TE>
<TE>   The three rebel groups said in a joint statement after their
meeting Monday that another French attack on their positions would be
considered a casus belli, or cause for war. They said six rebels were
killed in the French attack Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "The MPCI, the MPIGO and the MJP will then launch a widespread
attack on all fronts," the groups said.</TE>
<TE>   The clash at Duekoue on Saturday was the first time the French had
opened fire to stop the rebels since France began beefing up its
operation into its biggest African intervention force since the
1980s, with up to 2,500 troops.</TE>
<TE>   "If they try to go through our positions, we are obliged to open
fire if they open fire," French army spokesman Frederic Thomazo said
before the rebel announcement. The Foreign Ministry in Paris had no
comment on the rebel threat.</TE>

<HD>Military Action Possible, U.S. Warns N. Korea</HD>
<DH>Americans could win a war in northeast Asia even while
battling Iraq, Rumsfeld says. Meanwhile, more signs of Pyongyang's
nuclear arms program are seen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter and Alissa J. Rubin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- North Korea took new steps toward reactivating its
nuclear weapons program Monday as Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld warned Pyongyang that the U.S. military could win a war on
the Korean peninsula even while battling Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   In Vienna, officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or
IAEA, the U.N. organization monitoring the North Korean nuclear
program, said that they saw new signs that Pyongyang was moving ahead
with the bomb-building program.</LD>
<LD>   The officials said the North Koreans on Monday dismantled U.N.
surveillance cameras and broke locks on a reprocessing plant for
spent nuclear fuel rods at the sprawling Yongbyon complex. The move
came after the North Koreans removed surveillance cameras and seals
from a storage facility for spent fuel rods at the same complex over
the weekend.</LD>
<TE>   In Washington, Rumsfeld warned that if North Korea was resuming
its bomb program out of a belief that the United States was
distracted by a possible war against Iraq, "it would be a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   "We're capable of winning decisively in one [theater] and swiftly
defeating in the case of the other," he said. "Let there be no
doubt."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld added, however, that military action was not imminent,
and that he had seen no evidence to suggest North Korea's actions
were timed to coincide with the approach of a possible war against
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the likelihood of confrontation with North Korea seemed to
grow over the weekend, with the North Koreans taking steps at
Yongbyon -- where 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods are stored -- to
restart their nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   The impoverished Stalinist regime is moving more quickly than U.S.
officials had expected toward resuming a bomb-building effort that
North Korea halted in 1994 in exchange for an international program
of energy aid.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang could have a handful of nuclear bombs by the second half
of next year if it begins reprocessing the spent-fuel rods to acquire
bomb-making material, U.S. officials and other experts say. Such a
move would pose a dangerous new nuclear proliferation threat, and
destabilize northeast Asia, already one of the most heavily armed
regions of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The plutonium reprocessing plant at Yongbyon could be ready to
begin producing fissile material for bombs within a few months, said
Mohammed Baradei, director general of the IAEA. North Korea was
expected to finish removing the cameras and seals from the
reprocessing site today, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Baradei, in an interview with CNN, described the situation as
"rapidly deteriorating."</TE>
<TE>   He added that if the North Koreans restart the reprocessing plant,
which was taken offline in 1994 under an agreement brokered by the
United States, "then we [would be] in a pretty dangerous situation."</TE>
<TE>   The IAEA views the events unfolding in North Korea as being just
as serious and dangerous as those in Iraq, said Mark Gwozdecky,
director of public information for the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "This is every bit as important as Iraq -- they are different in
so many ways, but they are sharing equal billing at the top of our
priority list," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two IAEA inspectors who live on the Yongbyon site saw the North
Koreans cutting the seals and disabling the surveillance cameras
Monday and alerted the Vienna headquarters. So far, the North Koreans
have not asked the inspectors to leave, although without surveillance
cameras, it is difficult for the monitors to do their job. The IAEA
has little muscle unless, as was the case with Iraq, it is given
specific authority by the U.N. Security Council to undertake
intrusive inspections backed up by the threat of force.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Rumsfeld's warning, U.S. officials insist that they want
to solve the problem not by military action, but through a diplomatic
campaign by the United States and countries in northeast Asia. North
Korea has a huge concentration of troops, artillery, tanks and other
equipment along its border with the South near Seoul, and a military
conflict could kill hundreds of thousands of people within its first
hours, experts predict.</TE>
<TE>   Philip T. Reeker, a State Department spokesman, said the United
States seeks "a peaceful resolution of the situation that North Korea
has created by its pursuit of the nuclear weapons program." However,
he said that the United States would not make concessions because of
the threatened moves to build a bomb, as the Clinton administration
and allies did eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not give in to blackmail," he said. "The international
community will not enter into dialogue in response to threats or
broken commitments, and we're not going to bargain or offer
inducements for North Korea to live up to the treaties and agreements
it has signed."</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell talked over the weekend and on
Monday to officials in Britain, France, Russia, Japan, China and
South Korea about North Korea's latest moves, Reeker said.</TE>
<TE>   Plunged into his first crisis only days after his election, South
Korean President-elect Roh Moo Hyun met Monday with outgoing
President Kim Dae Jung about how to handle the North Korean
situation.</TE>
<TE>   Some U.S. analysts noted that despite the North Korean moves, the
regime has not yet actually resumed its nuclear program.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Wit, an Asia specialist at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, said that until the North Koreans begin
reprocessing the spent fuel, or eject the IAEA inspectors, they have
not taken the final step. Yet he said he believed most officials in
the North Korean regime favored resuming the nuclear program, and
predicted that the North could have a handful of nuclear weapons by
the latter part of next year.</TE>
<TE>   He said he found it "shocking" that the United States would be
willing to allow North Korea to build a bomb without trying to resume
negotiations. "It serves the cynical purpose of pushing all the other
countries in the region into our lap, to isolate North Korea," he
said. "And then, according to our cynical game plan, North Korea will
collapse."</TE>
<TE>   Roh won last week's election in South Korea on promises of using
gentle persuasion to get North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.
But North Korea's recent actions threaten to strain his patience and
might be a key test for the new president even before he takes office
Feb. 25.</TE>
<TE>   "North Korea's behavior pattern is difficult to understand. It was
thought that the North Korean leadership would have been happier to
see a progressive win the election and that there would be some
cooperation with regard to the nuclear issue, but they are behaving
in sharp contrast to expectations," said Chung Ok Nim, an
international relations specialist at the Sejong Institute in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans had informed the IAEA in Vienna that they would
unilaterally remove the monitoring equipment, but it was widely
assumed that they were bluffing, or that weeks would ensue before it
happened.</TE>
<TE>   "They are acting in a hasty and obnoxious manner," said Song Young
Sun, a North Korea watcher from the Korea Institute for Defense
Analyses in Seoul. "They are really desperate to draw the United
States into negotiations. They figure that the United States is in a
hurry to go to war with Iraq and that they will have the best
bargaining position now."</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang on Monday repeated its demand for a pact with the United
States that would guarantee that the North would not be attacked.</TE>
<TE>   "If the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is to be settled
properly, the U.S. should stop posing a nuclear threat to [North
Korea] and accept [our] proposal for the conclusion of a
nonaggression treaty between the two countries," said Rodong Sinmun,
the daily newspaper of the North Korean ruling party.</TE>
<TE>   Richter reported from Washington and Rubin from Vienna. Times
staff writer Barbara Demick in Seoul contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Arafat Cool Toward Latest Mideast Plan</HD>
<DH>Sen. Lieberman, touring region, backs statehood for
Palestinians. Israel kills a Hamas fugitive, and arrests two in
kibbutz attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat expressed reservations
Monday about a U.S.-backed Mideast peace plan, while a visiting U.S.
senator and key supporter of Israel spoke out in favor of a
Palestinian state.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) said a solution to the Mideast
conflict must include a "strong and peaceful" Palestinian state.
Lieberman met with Palestinian officials Monday but shunned Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   Also Monday, a top Hamas fugitive, Shaman Sobih, and an accomplice
were shot dead by Israeli troops in what Palestinian security
officials said was a targeted killing. The two were riding a tractor
when they were ambushed near the West Bank city of Jenin, the
officials said. The Israeli army declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate incident, Israeli security agents arrested two
Israeli Arabs in connection with a Palestinian attack that killed
five people at Kibbutz Metzer in northern Israel. A government
statement said the Israeli Arabs had hidden the gunman's rifle after
the Nov. 10 attack.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Israeli government announced that it had approved
plans to build 232 more houses in the West Bank Jewish settlement of
Emmanuel and that it would invest $2.6 million in tourism projects in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   The projects were approved even as the so-called quartet of
Mideast mediators -- the U.S., the U.N., the European Union and
Russia -- pressed ahead with winning Israeli and Palestinian support
for a three-phase plan that would culminate with Palestinian
statehood by 2005. Among other things, the plan calls for a freeze on
Jewish construction in the West Bank and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   The plan has been circulating for weeks, and over the weekend,
Israel and the Palestinians were given a revised version
incorporating some of their initial comments. A final plan is
expected to be adopted after Israel's Jan. 28 general election.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, speaking to reporters Monday at his Ramallah headquarters,
said he was studying the new proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have received is not a final draft, and we still have a
lot of reservations," he said. "Israel itself did not accept it yet."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman deplored the "desperate human conditions" he saw during
his tour of the West Bank and said Congress wants to help.</TE>
<TE>   "There's strong support for the aspirations of the Palestinian
people for independent statehood," he said.</TE>

<HD>Mayor, 3 Others Die in Philippine Blast</HD>
<DH>Eleven people are wounded. Military suspects Muslim rebels
in the bombing.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COTABATO, Philippines</DL>
<LD>A bomb killed at least four people, including a town mayor, and
wounded 11 in the southern Philippines on Christmas Eve, the military
said.</LD>
<LD>   The blast today was thought to be the work of Islamic separatists,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The bomb went off at the home of Mayor Saudi Ampatuan in the town
of Datu Piang on Mindanao island, said army spokesman Maj. Julieto
Ando. Ampatuan later died of injuries to his head and abdomen.</LD>
<TE>   Also killed were a town councilor, the treasurer and a bodyguard,
Ando said. Eleven people were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The military suspects the Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels
because "it is only the MILF that is capable of making powerful
homemade bombs," Ando said.</TE>
<TE>   But rebel spokesman Eid Kabalu denied involvement, saying the
mayor had many personal and political enemies.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason for us to do that because the mayor is not our
enemy. In fact, many of those injured are my relatives," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ando said army bomb experts were helping police determine the type
of explosives used. The military has blamed the MILF for similar
bombings in the area, in which mortar shells equipped with time
devices were used.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels, who have signed a truce with the government, have been
fighting for Muslim self-rule in the southern Philippines for nearly
three decades. But they are believed to be lacking the support of
prominent Muslim families for their struggle.</TE>
<TE>   The Philippines is mainly Christian.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion occurred at a gathering honoring a dead relative of
the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Ando said the blast appeared to be unrelated to the killing of
Ampatuan's younger brother, his brother's wife and a friend during an
altercation at a disco Saturday. The Ampatuans allegedly retaliated
for that killing by ambushing two relatives of the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Ando said Ampatuan is a "nemesis" of the MILF who survived a rebel
ambush with his father, Maguindanao province Gov. Andal Ampatuan,
this year. Two of their bodyguards died in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Kabalu said the target of that ambush was the convoy's armed
escort.</TE>

<HD>Saudis Must Stem Cash for Terror, Report Says</HD>
<DH>Investigator writing to the U.N. contends that a blurring
between religion and finance in the kingdom is hindering reform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sebastian Rotella</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>BARCELONA, Spain -- Despite a crackdown on terrorism financing after
the Sept. 11 attacks, Saudi Arabia still must dismantle a system that
has permitted hundreds of millions of dollars to flow to Islamic
extremists through businesses and charities, according to a report
submitted to the U.N.</LD>
<LD>   Prominent Saudi donors, companies and charities whose funds have
been traced to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network by investigators
around the world are still doing business, the French investigator
who wrote the report said in an interview Monday. The problem stems
in part from a blurring of religion and finance in Saudi society that
impedes reform, according to the report.</LD>
<LD>   "Al Qaeda was able to receive between $300 [million] and $500
million over the last 10 years from wealthy businessmen and bankers,
whose fortunes represent about 20% of the Saudi GNP, through a web of
charities and companies acting as fronts," said Jean-Charles Brisard,
the investigator. "Most of this financial backbone is still at large
and able to support fundamentalist institutions."</LD>
<TE>   The 34-page report was submitted by Brisard last week at the
request of the Colombian ambassador to the United Nations, the
current president of the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Brisard spent years analyzing Al Qaeda's finances for a French
intelligence service. He works now as a private investigator for
relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks who have filed a lawsuit
against Saudi political and economic leaders alleging they sponsored
Al Qaeda terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Saudi mission to the United Nations declined
to comment on the allegations Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "The report speaks for itself," the official said. "We do not
comment on such reports."</TE>
<TE>   Saying they have been unfairly criticized in the aftermath of the
World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks, Saudi authorities have taken
steps to regulate hundreds of millions of dollars in religious
donations that leave the kingdom each year. In November, authorities
said they would intensify audits of Islamic charities and create new
regulations and special units to fight money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   But the report says such measures are insufficient because the
financing of terror, in which legitimate funds are diverted to
criminal purposes, differs from money laundering, which recycles
criminal profits into legal enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia must change a culture whose "entire legal framework,
from state regulation to charities control through religious
interpretation" helps "corrupt a system that may be honest and
legitimate at its beginning," the report states.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing from court cases and intelligence activity around the
world, Brisard outlines the financial structure of Al Qaeda before a
U.S. military operation last year wiped out its headquarters in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden's organization, the report says, spent as little as 10%
of its estimated budget on actual terrorist operations, whose costs
are often modest: The Sept. 11 plotters are thought to have spent
about $600,000. A bombing on the Indonesian island of Bali that
killed more than 190 people in October cost about $74,000, according
to the report.</TE>
<TE>   While terrorist cells often sustain themselves with criminal
activity, Al Qaeda has spent most of its money on communications,
training bases and protection payments to host states such as Sudan
and Afghanistan, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda's fugitive leaders are now believed to be paying
protection to ward off capture in tribal areas along the
Afghan-Pakistan border, Brisard said.</TE>
<TE>   The report says Bin Laden's public statements show he has
encouraged and profited from the abuse of zakat, a pillar of the
Islamic faith that requires Muslims to give a percentage of their
earnings to the needy. Because the donations are largely unregulated,
they have become "the most important source of financial support for
the Al Qaeda network," the report states.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi officials who oversee the payments have failed to regulate
the donations that flow to 241 Saudi charity organizations operating
in the kingdom or abroad, according to the report. Sometimes
unwittingly and sometimes intentionally, charities have been conduits
of funding for Bin Laden's "holy war" against the West.</TE>
<TE>   Omar Faruq, an accused Al Qaeda operative arrested this year in
Indonesia and interrogated by U.S. agents, identified the Al Haramain
Islamic Foundation as "the funding mechanism" for terrorists in
Indonesia, the report states. The Saudis have shut down branches of
that charity in Somalia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, but other offices
still function, Brisard said.</TE>
<TE>   The kingdom has "repeatedly tried to establish legal rules to
govern zakat and donations," Brisard acknowledged. Since Sept. 11
last year, Saudi authorities say they have frozen a total of about
$5.5 million in 33 bank accounts belonging to three individuals.</TE>
<TE>   However, the report alleges that resistance from religious
conservatives has shielded businesspeople, companies and banks
involved in a structure that benefits extremists. The report
recommends that Saudi Arabia make drastic changes such as forming a
nonreligious agency to oversee the zakat process and banning cash
donations and charitable contributions by companies.</TE>
<TE>   "One must question the real ability and willingness of the kingdom
to exercise any control over the use of religious money in and
outside of the country ... ," the report concludes. "The
unwillingness of the Saudi government to consider its responsibility
in that regard is a major setback in the war against terrorism
financing."</TE>

<HD>Exiled Italian Royal Family Makes Lightning Visit to
Homeland</HD>
<DH>Victor Emmanuel, his wife and son meet with pope as part of
a first, sentimental tour after lifting of half-century ban on heirs'
return.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley and Maria De Cristofaro</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>The son of Italy's last king returned briefly to his homeland and met
with Pope John Paul II on Monday, ending half a century of exile
imposed after World War II as punishment for his family's support of
Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.</LD>
<LD>   "I came back to Rome after 56 years, and I have no words to
describe my emotions in this moment," said Victor Emmanuel before the
end of his one-day visit. "We have seen the Colosseum.... We haven't
been to the Pantheon -- there was no time -- but we will have
occasions to do that. Rome is a marvelous city. I remembered it like
that, even if I was very young when I was forced to leave."</LD>
<LD>   Victor Emmanuel, 65, who is under treatment for a back injury
suffered in a recent motor rally accident in Egypt, said he and his
family would return early next year.</LD>
<TE>   "This time, we wanted to come before Christmas to visit his
holiness, but we'll be back when my health is better," he said before
returning to Switzerland, where the Savoy family has been living.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Emmanuel was accompanied by his wife, Marina Doria, and
their son, Emmanuel Filiberto, 30, a financial consultant who was
born and raised in Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   A constitutional amendment took effect in November that lifted a
ban against the presence in Italy of male descendants of the last
king, Umberto II, who reigned for just one month in 1946. The
European Court of Human Rights had pushed Italy to allow the Savoy
heirs to return as ordinary citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to let the Savoys return "is an indication of the
strength of our republic," said Franco Pavoncello, a political
scientist at John Cabot University in Rome. "The issue of the king
and the royal house in Italy is an issue that is now relegated to the
history books."</TE>
<TE>   Umberto II's father, King Victor Emmanuel III, was largely a
figurehead monarch during Mussolini's rule. But he is remembered for
having signed into law in 1938 infamous anti-Jewish measures that
later led to the murders of thousands of Italian Jews in Nazi death
camps. After the 1943 fall of Mussolini, the Savoys fled Italy, an
act seen by many as abandonment of the country while it fell under
German occupation.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, many regarded the royal house as partly to blame
for the country's devastation. But a strong pro-monarchy movement
also raised fears of destabilization of Italy's young democracy.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1946 referendum, Italians voted in favor of a republic rather
than a monarchy. The ban against the Savoys was then imposed partly
to ensure they could play no future political role.</TE>
<TE>   Not all have forgiven the family its wartime deeds.</TE>
<TE>   "I think history told us what kind of people they are," said
Sergio Cesarini, a Rome gardener.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sorry for the son, but Victor Emmanuel himself shouldn't
be allowed into the country. The reasons are written in our Italian
history."</TE>
<TE>   Victor Emmanuel expressed enthusiasm Monday for playing the role
of tourist in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll start to visit the whole of Italy with my son, who doesn't
know it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Seeing how well we've been received, it will be a great pleasure
to be among you all again. I want to go to Naples, and then we will
go to Venice and visit all the other parts of Italy like someone who
doesn't know the country."</TE>
<TE>   The House of Savoy, once a duchy in southeastern France, traces
its history to Umberto the White Handed, the 11th century ruler of an
area that controlled the main road linking France and Italy. Family
members played a key role in uniting Italy as a country in the 19th
century, and the Pantheon, an ancient Roman monument, was used for
their tombs.</TE>
<TE>   Emmanuel Filiberto said that for him, coming to Rome was
"something magical."</TE>
<TE>   The family met for 20 minutes with John Paul, exchanging Christmas
greetings and gifts. Each of the Savoys bowed to the pontiff and
kissed his hand. Victor Emmanuel gave John Paul a book on the House
of Savoy, while the pope gave each of them a rosary.</TE>
<TE>   There is now only a very weak monarchical movement in Italy, but
on Monday one of its leaders, Sergio Boschiero, national secretary of
the Italian Monarchist Union, described the ban as "a negative
chapter in history" and said he is "happy that the persecution has
ended."</TE>

<HD>Settlement Sprawl Cuts Off Palestinians</HD>
<DH>Some see an Israeli campaign to harass them out of homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TAIBE, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Daoud and Maria Khoury watch it from their kitchen window.</LD>
<LD>   Each year, each month, another little bit of the Jewish settlement
of Ofra comes a little bit closer.</LD>
<LD>   Taibe is a predominantly Christian Palestinian village that sits
just east of Ofra, across a stony valley. Ofra's easternmost trailers
have sprouted on the ridge and begun marching down the slope. With
the housing, a new settlers-only road has appeared as well as light
posts that illuminate the night.</LD>
<TE>   "It doesn't look very good," Daoud Khoury, 46, said. "They're
taking more and more land. They talk about land for peace, but this
shows they have no intention of [leaving] the West Bank. They think
it's all for them."</TE>
<TE>   The Khoury patriarch, Canaan, who died in September, moved to
Taibe in 1948, after Israel's war of independence forced him from his
home in the coastal city of Jaffa. Most of his children studied
overseas but returned after the 1993 Oslo accords ushered in what
many believed would be peace and the creation of an independent
Palestine.</TE>
<TE>   The Khourys invested $1.2 million to build the only brewery in the
Palestinian territories. Until the outbreak of the current intifada,
or uprising, almost 27 months ago, the Taybeh microbrewery was wildly
successful.</TE>
<TE>   It was producing at full capacity, about 50 U.S. barrels a week,
and distributing inside Israel and as far away as Germany. Now,
output is 20% of capacity and expansion plans have been shelved.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is the frequent closures that the Israeli army
slaps on Taibe and most other Palestinian towns. Palestinians cannot
leave their homes except when the army allows. And while settlers
have free rein on the roads, Palestinian use is restricted.</TE>
<TE>   The settlements, and all of the security apparatus that goes into
protecting them, has created what Israeli human rights advocates
describe as two parallel, unequal regimes. Settlers have all the
rights, and then some, of Israeli citizens, while the Palestinians
suffer enormous discrimination, human rights groups say.</TE>
<TE>   Khoury said entrances to Taibe are routinely blocked by the
military. Maria manages to get their two sons to school in Ramallah,
the nearest Palestinian city, on most days, but they have to travel
circuitous and often dangerous routes that can take hours. Even then,
it's only possible because Maria holds a foreign passport.</TE>
<TE>   Khoury's sister Grace gave up, and this fall put her children in
one of Taibe's inferior schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We sacrificed education for safety," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Watching the expansion of settlements like Ofra, while their own
worlds are constantly curtailed, is part of what Palestinians see as
an Israeli strategy of harassment.</TE>
<TE>   "They want us to pack up, close the brewery and leave the land,"
Khoury said. "In their dreams!"</TE>

<HD>Marchers Back Work Stoppage in Venezuela</HD>
<DH>Tens of thousands take to the streets of Caracas to show
their support for the effort to topple President Chavez. Oil woes
worsen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the state oil monopoly
Monday to support a strike aimed at toppling President Hugo Chavez,
hours after opposition demonstrators clashed with police in western
Venezuela.</LD>
<LD>   Marchers held up flashlights, candles and torches in the darkness
as they poured into Caracas on highways connecting the capital with
various suburbs.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier Monday, national guard troops fired tear gas and rubber
bullets at several dozen protesters whose march across a bridge in
western Venezuela had blocked the only connection between oil
refineries on the eastern and western sides of Lake Maracaibo.</LD>
<TE>   Pro- and anti-Chavez demonstrations have taken place almost daily
during the strike, which was called by business and labor groups and
opposition politicians Dec. 2 to force Chavez to resign or submit to
early elections. They say Chavez's leftist policies and autocratic
style have ruined the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The National Elections Council has accepted an opposition petition
for a nonbinding referendum in February asking Venezuelans whether
Chavez should resign. Thousands of Venezuelans registered Monday for
the possible vote, although Chavez has said he won't honor it.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel earlier urged a holiday truce.
But the opposition rebuffed his informal appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "What response do you expect from a people who this regime
considers an enemy? The people are speaking, but this regime is
deaf," union leader Carlos Ortega, a Chavez opponent, told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Peace talks brokered by the Organization of American States have
failed to prod the government and opposition toward ending the
standoff. OAS chief Cesar Gaviria held talks again Monday but with
little progress. New talks are scheduled Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, who survived a coup in April, has rejected calls for an
early vote. Massive protests, rallies and violent street clashes have
rattled the South American nation since the coup. At least 60 people
were killed during the April uprising before loyal troops restored
Chavez to power.</TE>
<TE>   Many businesses have reopened despite the strike, but the work
stoppage has closed down state oil monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela,
paralyzing an industry that provides more than 70% of the country's

<HD>U.S. Drug Rings Probed for Ties to Mideast Terrorists</HD>
<DH>Federal agents say they are investigating dozens of cases
where proceeds may be funding Islamic extremists. One alleged plot
has been identified.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal agents are investigating more than 40 major narcotics cases
in the U.S. in which the proceeds of drug trafficking may have gone
to Middle East terrorists, officials say.</LD>
<LD>   To date, only one of those cases -- a nationwide methamphetamine
ring -- has been publicly identified. But in a recent interview, Drug
Enforcement Administration chief Asa Hutchinson said authorities are
examining dozens of other domestic drug cases with potential links to
Islamic terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   The possible ties between drug rings and Middle East extremists,
Hutchinson said, would be a result of U.S. efforts to shut down other
potential financial sources of terrorism, such as phony companies or
charities.</LD>
<TE>   "Because there is pressure on the traditional funding sources ...
pressure on the money flowing to these groups, that leaves them to be
entrepreneurs in how they will come up with money for the different
cells," said Hutchinson, President Bush's choice as undersecretary
for border and transportation security in the new Homeland Security
Department.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, "leads them to various criminal activities
[including] increased linkage to drug activity," Hutchinson said.
"That is the evidence we see and the trend that we see."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, three men who allegedly sought to trade half a ton of
heroin and five tons of hashish for four shoulder-fired Stinger
missiles were charged in San Diego. That alleged plot is an FBI case,
and included plans to sell the missiles to the Al Qaeda network of
terrorists, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   One Justice Department source said the plot may say less about Al
Qaeda's operation than the opportunism of extremists with access to
large quantities of narcotics, since some authorities believe the
three San Diego defendants would have sold the missiles to anyone for
the right price.</TE>
<TE>   The Stinger missile case is illustrative of a burgeoning nexus
between illicit drugs and terrorism, said Bill Gore, special agent in
charge of the FBI's San Diego office.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a real problem," he said. "There is no doubt that a lot of
these groups have been supported by the sale of illegal narcotics ...
[and] I think we will see more of these."</TE>
<TE>   With more than 360 agents in 56 countries, the DEA has a far
better chance of uncovering the drug-terrorism connections than other
agencies, including the FBI, Gore said. Even then, it is difficult to
prove that money from drug rings is destined for extremists, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they have been at it a long time. And to the extent that
narcotics trafficking has flourished overseas, it is an obvious
source of funding," Gore said. "The whole issue has not flown under
our radar. It is just very difficult to penetrate these groups."</TE>
<TE>   In May, Hutchinson said the DEA had uncovered "significant
evidence" that some of the millions of dollars collected by suppliers
in a methamphetamine ring went to the Iranian-backed terrorist group
Hezbollah.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said at the time, investigators had traced money
to defendants' families in Lebanon, Yemen and other Mideast
countries, raising the possibility that illicit proceeds could have
gone to other terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Then and now, Hutchinson has declined to provide any details about
that evidence, and federal prosecutors have not charged any of the
300-plus people arrested in that 3-year-old investigation with
anything but drug-related offenses.</TE>
<TE>   But in the wake of the San Diego case, Hutchinson said his agency
is moving forward on other drug investigations that could establish
funding connections to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "We have tried to get a better handle on the number of our cases
that have both ... a drug connection [and] a terrorist link of some
sort," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not exaggerating. There is always the qualifier that drugs
purchased in the United States may go to support terrorist or violent
groups around the globe."</TE>
<TE>   While the 40-plus cases cited by the DEA could prove to have links
to the Middle East, Hutchinson said the U.S. should not accept the
"artificial distinction" of pursuing those terrorists and not others
elsewhere in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously in terms of threats to the United States, that should
always be our focus," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Qaeda has proven to be targeting the United States and its
citizens, and that cannot be said for some South American groups."</TE>
<TE>   But that should not distract the DEA or other federal agencies
from pursuing other potential links between drugs and terrorism,
Hutchinson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are focused on Middle Eastern terrorist groups," he said. "But
if our drug sales in the United States fund the assassination of a
judge in Colombia or a prosecutor in Mexico, should we not feel the
same sense of responsibility" to act?</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the U.S. attorney's office in Houston unsealed an
indictment charging that four members of a paramilitary group in
Colombia sought to swap $25 million in cash and cocaine for five
shipping containers of weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The transaction, authorities alleged, was negotiated in Panama and
would have given the right-wing United Self-Defense Forces of
Colombia shoulder-fired missiles along with 300,000 grenades, 9,000
rifles and machine guns, 300 pistols and 60 million rounds of
ammunition.</TE>

<HD>Suits' Dismissal Sought on Religious Grounds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Boston Archdiocese asked a judge Monday to dismiss the hundreds
of sexual-abuse lawsuits against the church on freedom-of-religion
grounds. But the archdiocese said it is still committed to reaching a
settlement.</LD>
<LD>   The archdiocese said it made the dismissal request to satisfy its
insurers that it has employed all possible legal defenses.</LD>
<LD>   "Failure to do this could very well result in the insurance
companies walking away from us, saying that we have not exercised all
of our avenues of defense," said Bishop Richard G. Lennon.</LD>
<TE>   In court papers, the archdiocese argued that under the 1st
Amendment guarantee of freedom of religion, civil law does not apply
to how religious organizations supervise their personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The argument was filed with Superior Court Judge Constance Sweeney
even as Lennon renewed his request that all legal maneuvering in the
lawsuits be suspended so that settlement talks could be intensified.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey A. Newman, whose firm represents about 200 alleged
victims, believes the archdiocese remains sincere in its efforts to
move toward settlement of the more than 400 lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocesan spokeswoman Donna M. Morrissey said that the
archdiocese "believed in the argument" it filed with the court, but
that it is still committed to reaching a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, New Hampshire's bishop has suggested under oath that it
is less serious for a priest to have sex with someone from outside
the parish than with a parishioner.</TE>
<TE>   In depositions this fall, Bishop John B. McCormack said he knew
that Father Roland Cote had had sex with a teenage boy, but he noted
that the boy was not a parishioner.</TE>
<TE>   "One is an activity where you have a trusted relationship with a
parishioner. The other is an activity where you're away from the
parish and you're off on your own," McCormack said in depositions
obtained by Associated Press. "I'm very concerned about that; he was
a young person. But it's quite different from being with a
parishioner."</TE>
<TE>   McCormack spokesman Patrick McGee said Monday that a priest having
sex with a parishioner involves exploitation.</TE>

<HD>Bush Forms Panel to Improve Programs for Impoverished
Youths</HD>
<DH>A high-ranking task force will identify projects worthy of
expansion. Many of them aid minorities, but White House denies any
link to Lott issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Monday created a task force to improve federal
services for impoverished youths, programs that in some cases are
decades-old but that he said are "fragmented and not as successful as
hoped."</LD>
<LD>   Such programs -- ranging from Head Start and early maternal care
to job training -- frequently are targeted at racial and ethnic
minorities.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement of the task force follows the resignation Friday
by Trent Lott (R-Miss.) as Senate majority leader over remarks that
seemed to endorse racial segregation. The Lott controversy generated
widespread expectations that Bush and congressional Republicans would
respond by proposing more minority-friendly programs.</LD>
<TE>   But a White House official on Monday said the disadvantaged-youths
initiative was in the works for 11 months and had nothing to do with
the Lott issue.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't throw this together overnight," said one White
House aide who requested anonymity. "To somehow suggest that it may
be a reaction to any other events in the news is just inaccurate."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bush's directive came just two days after the Children's
Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group, called on the president to
invest greater resources in children.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush's initiative may well lead to funding cuts for some of
the programs. In his memo, the president explicitly instructed the
task force to consider recommending expansion of successful programs
-- and the consolidation or elimination of ones viewed as
ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   The president directed the task force to deliver by April 30 its
initial assessment of 117 federal programs, lodged within 15
different agencies, that serve low-income families. And he set an
Oct. 1 deadline for the task force to recommend an action plan to
better serve disadvantaged youths.</TE>
<TE>   "An unacceptably large number of American youth fail each year to
develop the academic, social and citizenship skills necessary to
succeed in our country," Bush said in his memo to the 12-member task
force, which consists of six Cabinet secretaries and six other
high-ranking administration officials.</TE>
<TE>   The president painted a grim picture of the state of impoverished
youths in America.</TE>
<TE>   "For example, 60% of fourth-graders from low-income families
cannot read at grade level, more than 2.6 million teens use illicit
substances each month, and 400,000 teens commit violent crimes each
year," Bush said. "Many of these young people grow up in economic and
social environments that place them at a significant disadvantage."</TE>
<TE>   The Children's Defense Fund, led by Marian Wright Edelman, has
been calling on the Bush administration to spend more on children --
and it has made sure to remind the president that he has all but
adopted the group's registered trademark -- "Leave no child behind."</TE>
<TE>   Edelman over the weekend sent Bush a "holiday card" urging him to
"please do not forget about our most important responsibility of all
-- our children" in his planned economic stimulus package due early
next year.</TE>
<TE>   "As a country, we must expand and improve after-school programs,
support local youth development activities, increase support for job
training and youth employment programs and increase prevention
efforts to keep children out of the juvenile justice system," Toby
Chaudhuri, a spokeswoman for the Children's Defense Fund, said
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's task force is to be chaired by Margaret Spellings, the
president's chief domestic policy advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Its other members include Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, Agriculture
Secretary Ann M. Veneman, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, Health and
Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Mel Martinez and Education Secretary Rod Paige.</TE>
<TE>   The task force's creation was announced in Washington by White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. Bush has been at Camp David with
his family since Saturday. He is scheduled to stay at the
presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains through
Christmas Day, and then depart Thursday for his ranch near Crawford,
Texas.</TE>

<HD>GOP Senators Pick Frist to Lead</HD>
<DH>They unite behind the Tennessean in an effort to squelch
the uproar boiling since Trent Lott appeared to endorse racial
segregation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senate Republicans on Monday named Sen. Bill Frist as the next Senate
majority leader, seeking to end the Trent Lott controversy with a
show of unity for the former heart surgeon from Tennessee.</LD>
<LD>   Frist's election, by acclamation through a cross-country telephone
conference call, completed a remarkable intraparty coup that toppled
Lott from the leadership post.</LD>
<LD>   GOP senators concluded that Frist would help them quell the
national uproar triggered by Lott's Dec. 5 remark in praise of a 1948
presidential candidacy that advocated racial segregation.</LD>
<TE>   Lott, a Mississippian, apologized repeatedly for his miscue, but
he never recovered. Hurt by a barrage of criticism -- including some
from President Bush -- he resigned as leader Friday, hours after
Frist mounted his own candidacy for the job. Frist effectively locked
up the job within hours of Lott's resignation, securing key
endorsements from potential rivals.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, in a conciliatory gesture, Lott participated in the
45-minute conference call that included 48 of the 51 Republicans who
will serve in the Senate next year. Lott, who had led his colleagues
as both majority and minority leader since 1996, apologized to his
colleagues for putting them through the leadership ordeal, according
to a Senate GOP aide. The aide, who requested anonymity, described
Lott's tone as "solemn."</TE>
<TE>   Frist, 50, will formally take over the majority leader's job when
the new Congress convenes on Jan. 7. He moved quickly to unify his
party and stem the political damage that the Lott controversy had
caused.</TE>
<TE>   "We must dedicate ourselves to healing those wounds of division
that have been reopened so prominently in the past few weeks," Frist
said in a televised appearance at his Nashville office after the
conference call. He took no questions.</TE>
<TE>   Referring repeatedly to his medical background, Frist said his
professional training enabled him "to listen very, very closely; to
diagnose; to treat; and, yes, to heal." He likened his ascension to
majority leader to the sensation he had experienced of holding a
heart in his hands before a transplant operation.</TE>
<TE>   "A few moments ago, my colleagues gave me a responsibility equal
to that, and in some ways, many would say, even a heavier
responsibility," he said. "I accepted that responsibility with a
profound sense of humility very similar to placing that heart into a
dying woman or a child or a man."</TE>
<TE>   His comments on issues also underscored his interest in health
issues. He spoke generally of the need to improve the economy, then
mentioned reforming Medicare, making prescription drugs more
affordable and improving medical treatment for the uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   Helping undo Lott, 61, was a voting record and previous comments
that were anathema to civil rights activists. Frist, by contrast, is
one of a newer breed of GOP politicians from the South who share
Bush's vision of trying to expand the party's appeal to minorities,
albeit through conservative policies.</TE>
<TE>   Frist's close ties to the White House -- and the distance Bush
kept from Lott throughout the recent furor -- sparked speculation
that the administration helped orchestrate the Tennessean's triumph.</TE>
<TE>   But the White House steadfastly denied that it was trying to
undermine Lott or promote Frist as a successor. On Monday, Frist
expressed surprise at how fast he had risen to power. "Seven days
ago, I had no earthly idea I would be standing before you," he told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Bush issued a statement congratulating Frist after his selection
had been announced, saying the senator "has earned the trust and
respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said: "I hope
we can work together to promote economic security and justice for all
Americans, protect America from terrorism and deal with the other
urgent needs of our nation."</TE>
<TE>   Despite such accolades and expressions of goodwill, Frist faces
instant challenges as he assumes one of the toughest jobs in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   As a prominent party spokesman, he must explain how Republicans
will answer persistent questions about race relations that have risen
anew since Lott's verbal blunder at the 100th birthday party for Sen.
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.).</TE>
<TE>   As a promoter of Bush's agenda, he must soothe the bruised
feelings of some senior GOP senators who felt Lott was betrayed by
his own party. Frist must also demonstrate that he is not the
president's puppet.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, as a coalition builder in a narrowly divided chamber, he
will have to reach out to Democrats who may be emboldened by the Lott
controversy to exploit GOP weaknesses among minority voters.</TE>
<TE>   Frist sought to do that Monday, calling Daschle to pledge
bipartisanship. An early test will come as the two leaders negotiate
a new Senate organizing resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats are pressing for nearly equal funding for their
committee staff; most Republicans want the lion's share of money.</TE>
<TE>   "His real problem is the Senate is difficult to manage," said
Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in
St. Louis. "He has a very slim majority, and it's going to be very
difficult to get the president's program through."</TE>
<TE>   With only 51 Republicans in a chamber that usually requires
60-vote majorities to pass major legislation, Frist cannot afford GOP
defections as he seeks support from Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways, he's now the coach giving a pep talk to the team,"
said Michael Franc, vice president of government relations for the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington. "He has
to pull them together psychologically and make them once again a
unified whole.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the narrow majority, he can't afford to have the residue of
this situation divide the Republican conference," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Frist becomes the 18th senator and ninth Republican to hold the
position of Senate majority leader. The position, unlike the speaker
of the House or the Senate president pro tempore, is not a
constitutional office. Instead, it developed in the 20th century as a
means for the modern Senate to manage the flow of legislation. The
majority leader, under Senate tradition, has the right to be
recognized before any other senator in the chamber. That gives him
(no leader has been a woman) the ability to call up bills, judicial
nominations or executive nominations -- and the right to ask for
cloture to shut down filibusters.</TE>
<TE>   For Frist, who is thought to have presidential ambitions in 2008,
the post could be an important stepping-stone. One Senate majority
leader, Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, has gone on to become
president. Another, Republican Bob Dole of Kansas, became his party's
nominee for president in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   In replacing Lott, Frist vaulted over several senators who had
outranked him in the party's leadership. Among them were Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, the incoming majority whip, and Rick Santorum
of Pennsylvania, the conference chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Frist was most recently the chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, a key campaign position but lower on the
leadership ladder.</TE>
<TE>   Two of his new leadership lieutenants, Santorum and George Allen
of Virginia, told reporters on Capitol Hill that the party is eager
to put the Lott episode behind it.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now back on track and ready to move forward," Santorum
said. He had been a Lott loyalist and briefly considered challenging
Frist on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not, obviously, a joyous celebration, for Sen. Frist or
anybody," Santorum said.</TE>
<TE>   Allen, an early backer of Frist and his replacement as head of the
GOP Senate campaign committee, described Republicans who participated
in Monday's phone call as "prayerful" and, now, united.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we all have learned," Allen said. "I think there's
greater understanding. And with that, we're going to move forward
with an agenda."</TE>

<HD>Matsui Named to Key House Post</HD>
<DH>Fellow Californian is well-positioned to lead the
Democrats' 2004 election efforts, Pelosi says. Lawmaker could face a
tough challenge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Incoming House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi on Monday named fellow
California Rep. Robert T. Matsui to lead the party's uphill effort to
regain control of the House of Representatives in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   By naming Matsui chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, Pelosi turned to a veteran legislator considered fluent on
the issues, well-connected in money circles and, perhaps most
important, loyal to her personally.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement, Pelosi praised Matsui as "an expert on complex
issues" who is well-positioned to attract "grass-roots and financial
support across the nation." The selection of Matsui, a Japanese
American from Sacramento, makes him the first Asian American to serve
in the top levels of the House Democratic leadership.</LD>
<TE>   Matsui, who served as treasurer of the Democratic National
Committee in the early 1990s, promised a more aggressive effort to
sharpen Democratic contrasts with President Bush and recruit strong
candidates earlier in the election cycle. "I really believe we can
take the House back in 2004," he said. Some Democratic insiders
believe the selection could ruffle feathers in the Congressional
Black Caucus, which had been aggressively promoting Rep. William J.
Jefferson (D-La.) for the job. "This could cause [Pelosi] some
problems," one senior House Democratic aide said. "The Black Caucus
was pushing hard for this ... and they thought they had it."</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), the outgoing caucus
chair, praised the choice Monday night. "I think he is an excellent
selection," she said. "It was [Pelosi's] call. We supported our
colleague, we felt he could do a good job, but Bob Matsui is ... a
great member and a good friend."</TE>
<TE>   The scale of Matsui's challenge is formidable. In the 2002
election, Republicans gained six seats to push their total to 229,
which means Democrats will need to win 12 seats to regain the
majority in the 435-member chamber. That's a significant number at a
time when redistricting has reduced the number of competitive seats.</TE>
<TE>   Another challenge is the ban on "soft" money -- the unregulated
contributions from corporations, unions and individuals for
"party-building" activities -- that took effect Nov. 6.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,
a watchdog organization, House Democrats have been much more
dependent than House Republicans on those unlimited contributions.
Matsui, 61, was first elected to Congress in 1978 and has been a
leader on tax, trade and Social Security issues from his post on the
Ways and Means Committee. His voting record is generally left of
center, but he has challenged party orthodoxy, particularly in his
aggressive support for free trade.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, he attributed the Republicans' gains in 2002 to
their financial advantage, Bush's success at "nationalizing" the
election around defense and homeland security issues, and the
Democrats' inability to establish an alternative economic agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Matsui also hinted that Democrats over the last three elections
had relied too heavily on promises to add a prescription drug benefit
to Medicare and oppose private accounts in Social Security. "Those
are critical issues ... but we have to talk about something much
larger," he said. "We need to really focus on the economy."</TE>

<HD>Mormons Cut Hundreds of Jobs From Utah Workforce</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the state's largest
religion and employer, has cut hundreds of jobs from its Utah
workforce.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with falling investment income, and perhaps feeling the
effects of lower tithing, the church recently offered voluntary early
retirements, effective for nearly 1,000 employees this week, the Salt
Lake Tribune reported in a copyright story. About 600 employees opted
to take advantage of the voluntary exit, and 40% of the vacated
positions will not be filled.</LD>
<LD>   The church refused to provide employment specifics.</LD>
<TE>   However, based on employment ranges from a Web site operated by
Utah's Workforce Services Department, the Tribune estimated that the
Mormon church tops Utah's next-biggest employer -- state government
-- by more than 10,000 employees, or 33,355, compared with 22,500.</TE>
<TE>   Figures show about 29,140 employees working directly for the
church in Utah, as distinct from the more than 4,215 working at its
for-profit businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The release of 600 employees represents a 2% reduction in Mormon
church employment in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   "Like many large organizations attempting to meet the challenges
of a difficult economy, the church is reviewing a number of options
to better manage overall costs, including numbers of employees," said
church spokesman Dale Bills.</TE>

<HD>More Thorough Review Ordered on Utah Drilling</HD>
<DH>Judge sides with environmentalists on issue. Decision will
delay the planned seismic exploration for oil near Arches National
Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Siding with environmental groups, a federal judge here has directed
the Bush administration to conduct a more thorough environmental
review before exploring for oil outside Arches National Park in Utah.</LD>
<LD>   The decision will delay the planned seismic exploration project in
the Dome Plateau -- 23,000 acres of scenic desert popular with
hikers, mountain bikers and other outdoor enthusiasts -- and is the
most recent of several setbacks that the courts have dealt the
administration as it tries to expand oil and gas development in the
West.</LD>
<LD>   It is also one of several examples of courts agreeing with
environmental groups that the administration had too narrowly
interpreted the National Environmental Policy Act, the Magna Carta of
environmental laws.</LD>
<TE>   Environmentalists said the decision has broad implications for the
administration's efforts to hasten oil and gas development in the
West.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision will affect the Bush administration's whole approach
to opening the West to drilling. They're not going to be able to do
things quite as quickly as they wanted to," said Sharon Buccino, an
attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the
environmental groups involved in the case.</TE>
<TE>   However, an administration official stressed that the decision was
a narrow one.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very specific decision regarding this specific company
and their specific activities on public lands," said James Hughes,
deputy director of the Bureau of Land Management, the agency within
the Interior Department that is involved in the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes said the administration expects the ruling to have "no
impact" on its efforts to expedite oil and gas development and
restrict the application of the National Environmental Policy Act.</TE>
<TE>   The law requires the government to conduct a comprehensive
environmental assessment and seek public comment whenever it plans
major actions that could have significant environmental consequences.</TE>
<TE>   To determine the extent of oil and gas reserves under the southern
Utah desert, WesternGeco, an exploration company, planned to send
multi-ton vehicles known as "thumper trucks" through the area to
collect seismic data. The trucks would pound the ground to emit shock
waves; the size and type of waves that come back would indicate the
location of deposits. Environmentalists warned that the process could
ravage the desert's delicate soils and vegetation, as well as the
wildlife that depends on it.</TE>
<TE>   In the case, which was resolved late Friday, U.S. District Judge
James Robertson ruled that in its haste to approve the project, the
agency failed to follow the requirements of the law. Specifically,
the BLM failed to thoroughly consider alternatives other than the one
proposed by the company, such as restricting the trucks to existing
roads.</TE>
<TE>   "BLM failed to adequately study, develop and describe appropriate
alternatives to recommended courses of action," the judge wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also criticized the Interior Board of Land Appeals, the
administrative review board, for failing to consider evidence
submitted by the plaintiffs during the review which showed that the
company's seismic trucks made 15-inch-deep ruts in the fragile desert
soil. The agency's environmental assessment anticipated 4-inch ruts.</TE>
<TE>   "The proof of the 15-inch ruts surely tended to show that BLM had
made unsupportable assumptions about the damage the trucks would
cause, that BLM had not properly identified the likely effects of
using these trucks to collect the required seismic data, and that
BLM's hurried analysis was not the 'hard look' required by law," the
judge wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said they expected the Interior Department to
make another decision after a more thorough review.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision sends a strong message to the Bush administration:
You have to obey the law," said Stephen Bloch, an attorney with the
Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, the lead plaintiff in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes said the agency would reconsider the project before another
decision is announced, thus delaying it several more months.</TE>
<TE>   Seismic vehicles completed half of the project before it was
halted in February pending an administrative review.</TE>

<HD>Bush Gives First Pardons to 7 Men in Minor Cases</HD>
<DH>Long-ago offenses include the stealing of $10.90 from the
mail and the making of untaxed whiskey. All served their sentences.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush granted his first pardons Monday when he excused seven
men for minor offenses from long ago, including an Indiana man who
stole $10.90 from the mail in 1971 and a Tennessean who made some
untaxed whiskey in 1962.</LD>
<LD>   The chief executive's action wipes away the criminal records of
the men, who have served their time behind bars or paid fines for
their offenses.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's sparing use of the pardon power stands in sharp and quite
deliberate contrast to President Clinton's rush of last-minute
pardons for 176 criminal offenders, including fugitive financier Marc
Rich.</LD>
<TE>   Administration officials stressed that all the men pardoned Monday
had applied for a pardon and were screened by the Justice Department.
And none were said to be personal friends of the president or
political donors.</TE>
<TE>   "These men were convicted of minor offenses, admitted their
crimes, completed their sentences and have gone on to lead exemplary
lives," said Mark Corallo, a Justice Department spokesman. "They all
went through the normal review process. The president's pardon power
is a wonderful thing, but it must be exercised with great care and
great caution."</TE>
<TE>   Bush signed off on the pardons, but the names were announced by
the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   "What all these cases have in common is that each pardon recipient
committed a relatively minor offense many years ago, completed his
prison sentence or probation and paid any fine, and has gone on to
live an exemplary life and to be a positive force in his community,"
said Ashley Snee, a White House spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   In his last days in office, Clinton decided to go ahead with
pardons of several friends and political allies, in some instances
without a full screening by the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   They included his brother Roger Clinton; Susan McDougal, who spent
time in jail for refusing to testify in the Whitewater investigation;
and onetime fugitive and newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst Shaw. The
former president's pardon of Rich proved to be the most controversial
because he had fled to Switzerland after being indicted on tax
charges.</TE>
<TE>   The first President Bush set off a controversy when he issued
Christmas Eve pardons in 1992 to seven Reagan administration
officials who were accused of lying about the Iran-Contra affair. One
of them, former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, faced a
possible perjury charge when it was revealed that he had kept a
secret diary during that time, but denied having any notes on the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   While the current President Bush has avoided controversy when
issuing pardons, he raised eyebrows earlier this month by bringing
back into his administration one of those who was pardoned by his
father.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott Abrams, a former assistant secretary of State during the
Reagan administration, pleaded guilty in 1991 to two counts of
withholding information from Congress about the secret diversions of
money to the Nicaraguan rebels, in defiance of a congressional ban on
such aid.</TE>
<TE>   He was pardoned along with Weinberger. In early December, he was
appointed to lead the National Security Council's office that
oversees Arab and Israeli affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The men pardoned by Bush on Monday were:</TE>
<TE>   * Kenneth Franklin Copley of Lyles, Tenn., who served two years'
probation for manufacturing untaxed whiskey;</TE>
<TE>   * Harlan Paul Dobas of Oregon, who was jailed for three months for
conspiracy involving the sale of grain stolen from his employer;</TE>
<TE>   * Stephen James Jackson of Mississippi, who was sentenced to three
years' probation and fined $500 for altering an odometer;</TE>
<TE>   * Douglas Harley Rogers of Wisconsin, a Jehovah's Witnesses
minister sentenced to two years in prison for failing to report for
military induction;</TE>
<TE>   * Walter F. Schuerer of Iowa, fined $15,000 for making a false
statement to the Social Security Administration regarding his
employment;</TE>
<TE>   * Paul Herman Wieser of Washington, sentenced to 18 months'
probation for stealing $38,000 worth of copper wire;</TE>
<TE>   * Olgen Williams of Indianapolis, a postal worker sentenced to a
year in jail for stealing $10.90 from the mail.</TE>

<HD>A Conference Call of Historic Proportions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>How do you get a passel of U.S. senators, scattered far and wide, on
the phone at once?</LD>
<LD>   Politically, the only correct answer is that you corral such major
players very, very deferentially. Logistically, you call AT&amp;T.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in Senate history, 48 Republican members got on
a conference call Monday and elected a new leader, Sen. Bill Frist of
Tennessee. The Senate Historian's Office said such a call has never
happened before. But "our office is not privy to every call they
make," Assistant Senate Historian Betty J. Koed added diplomatically.</LD>
<TE>   Aware that most of the lawmakers had gone home for the holidays
but still were eager to put the trauma that toppled Sen. Trent Lott
(R-Miss.) behind them, the Republican leadership decided Friday to
have the vote by phone. Two key logistical problems arose -- the line
had to be secure, and the vote had to be recorded.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T had the line. GOP staffers provided contact numbers for the
senators. It was decided that the phone company would tape the
conversation and then send the transcript to the Senate, where it
could be recorded, staffers at the Republican Conference said. Also
on the line, to witness the discussion, were staffers from the Senate
GOP leadership offices.</TE>
<TE>   Like teleworkers everywhere (as they're called in the industry),
senators dialed a number, gave a pass code and were admitted to the
call. If anyone knows which senators got on the line first and had to
wait for the others, they're not talking. Among the lawmakers who
missed the call was Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was traveling in
Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, Senate conference calls are placed by the Capitol
switchboard -- which handled four or five such phone calls Monday.
Staffers there reported that they soon may offer Web-based
teleconferencing as well.</TE>
<TE>   But the need for secrecy and privacy -- and the unusually large
number of participants -- meant the Senate opted for the low-tech
telephone conference, eschewing more dynamic videoconferencing.</TE>
<TE>   "They could have been more adventurous, but the old-fashioned
phone works quite well," said Tim Kane, chief executive and founder
of Kinetic Workplace, which he said helps Fortune 500 companies
"develop, implement and maintain their telework and virtual
officing."</TE>
<TE>   Kane said that as of last year, 28 million Americans were
"teleworking," and that the numbers have increased since the terror
attacks of Sept. 11. He called it "very encouraging to see our
politicians take advantage of the tremendous opportunities" provided
by the new technology.</TE>
<TE>   During Monday's call, Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia nominated
Frist, and incoming Sen. Norman Coleman of Minnesota seconded the
nomination. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania called for the "yeas,"
of which there were many. He called for the "nays," of which there
none. With Frist anointed, there followed a long spell of talk about
what issues to push in the new Congress. Finally, after 45 minutes,
the call ended.</TE>
<TE>   Frist is no stranger to the world of teleconferences. He uses them
to brief radio reporters in Tennessee on his activities, and he
conducted a videoconference with Roger Crouch, an astronaut from
Tennessee, while Crouch was aboard the space shuttle Columbia in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   But whether the Senate -- an institution that still records votes
in person by the laborious, if sonorous, roll call -- would again
take a vote by phone remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "It was because of Christmas," said one Senate staffer. "Normally,
we have a meeting."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Eighteen demonstrators were arrested outside police headquarters
Monday in the 10th day of protests over the killing of a handcuffed
black man by white police officers.</LD>
<LD>   One of those arrested was the Rev. Louis Coleman, a civil rights
activist and leader of the protest. Coleman refused to get out of the
street after police warnings.</LD>
<LD>   The protests involve the Dec. 5 death of James Taylor, who was
killed after two detectives went to investigate a woman's screams in
an apartment building. Officers said Taylor was cuffed with his hands
behind his back but reached a utility knife and lunged at the
detectives.</LD>

<HD>N.J. First to OK 'Smart-Gun' Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TRENTON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>New Jersey on Monday became the first state to enact "smart gun"
legislation that would eventually require new handguns to contain
technology that allows only their owners to fire them.</LD>
<LD>   However, the bill signed into law by Gov. James E. McGreevey will
not go into effect immediately because the technology is still being
developed. It could be years and cost millions before the technology
becomes a reality.</LD>
<LD>   "This is common-sense legislation. There are safety regulations on
cars, on toys. It's clearly time we have safety regulations on
handguns," McGreevey said.</LD>
<TE>   Under the law, smart-gun technology will be required in all new
handguns sold three years after the state attorney general determines
a smart gun prototype is safe and commercially available. Weapons
used by law enforcement officers would be exempt until a separate
decision on whether the requirement should apply to them.</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey Institute of Technology is developing a smart gun
prototype that would use sensors on the pistol grip to identify a
user.</TE>
<TE>   The owner would have his or her grip programmed at a gun shop or
police range by practice-firing the weapon.</TE>

<HD>Qatari Man Jailed on Fraud Counts Accused of Lying to FBI</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Meyer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors on Monday charged a Qatari man studying in the
United States with lying to the FBI and disclosed an investigation of
his potential links to an alleged top financier of Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   The six-count criminal complaint was filed in Manhattan, N.Y.,
federal court against Ali Saleh Kahlah Al-Marri, who had already been
in custody on fraud charges for more than a year in connection with
the investigation into the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   Al-Marri, also known as Abdullakareem A. Almuslam, appeared in
court Monday for a preliminary hearing and was ordered held in
custody. He also is expected to be indicted soon on the charges by a
federal grand jury and will plead not guilty, according to his
lawyer, Richard Jasper.</LD>
<TE>   Al-Marri also is set to stand trial in Illinois on Jan. 13 on
charges of unauthorized possession of credit card numbers with the
intention to defraud. He was indicted on those charges late last
year, shortly after coming to the United States on a student visa to
study for a master's degree in computer information systems at
Bradley University in Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Marri was initially interviewed by the FBI in October 2001 at
his home in Peoria, Ill., and was arrested two months later as a
material witness in the investigation into the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   During that investigation, authorities said, they found evidence
of suspicious activity in Al-Marri's laptop computer, including
indications he had bookmarked Web sites about dangerous chemicals
that showed the amounts "immediately dangerous to life or health" as
well as information about how to purchase them.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents who searched his computer found dozens of stolen credit
card numbers, the complaint said. Also during the search, the FBI
found an Arabic oath or prayer asking God to "protect" and "guard"
Bin Laden, audio files containing lectures by Bin Laden and his
associates, photographs of the Sept. 11 attacks and lists of Web
sites with titles such as "Jihad arena," "Taliban" and "martyrs,"
according to the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The search of Al-Marri's apartment also turned up an almanac with
bookmarks on pages about U.S. dams, reservoirs, waterways and
railroads, the complaint said.</TE>
<TE>   In the current case, Al-Marri was charged with making false
statements to FBI agents by denying during the earlier investigation
that he had called a telephone number in the United Arab Emirates
associated with Mustafa Ahmed Al-Hawsawi, an alleged associate of the
19 suicide hijackers and others linked to the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have described Al-Hawsawi as being perhaps the top
paymaster for the Al Qaeda terrorist network and say that he wired
thousands of dollars to the hijackers so they could carry out the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Hawsawi is an indicted co-defendant in the conspiracy case
against suspected 20th hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui, whose trial is
pending. The FBI also has linked him, via joint credit card accounts,
to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the Al Qaeda military commander who is
believed to have overseen the Sept. 11 plot and many other Al Qaeda
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Marri, a married father of five, also was charged Monday with
making false statements to banks.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Al-Marri lied to them about phone calls that were
made with a calling card that were traced back to Al-Hawsawi. They
also said he lied to FBI agents about aspects of his background,
telling agents he was last in the United States in 1991 while
attending Bradley as an undergraduate, when he had actually
re-entered the country in May 2000. At the time, authorities said,
Al-Marri used a stolen Social Security number to open fraudulent
credit card accounts before leaving several months later.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities had little to say about the new complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to be making any comments," said Marvin Smilon, a
spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in New York. "The original
charges are relatively modest. These are more serious."</TE>
<TE>   Al-Marri's lawyer said the government had no evidence his client
was connected in any way to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "My client isn't charged in any direct or even indirect
participation in Sept. 11," Jasper said. "They suggest, based on
inference, that he made these calls but they don't have any proof....
I just want to get my client out and on with his studies, either here
or in Qatar, wherever he chooses."</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Al-Marri faces up to 30 years in prison on each of
the three charges relating to lying to banks and 10 years if
convicted of lying to the FBI.</TE>

<HD>Alabama Shrugs, Wins at No. 1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TUSCALOOSA, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Kenny Walker had one of the best games of his career to make sure
Alabama's first No. 1 ranking wasn't a fly-by-night deal.</LD>
<LD>   So why wasn't he smiling?</LD>
<LD>   "The No. 1 ranking just makes it harder on us," Walker said after
scoring 24 points in the Crimson Tide's 82-64 victory over Morehead
State on Monday night. "We don't feel like we're No. 1."</LD>
<TE>   And the Crimson Tide didn't play that way at times, hours after
learning it was the nation's top-ranked team.</TE>
<TE>   Walker and Mo Williams saved Alabama (9-0) from a nerve-racking
ending, at least. They combined for 45 points and helped Alabama
rally after falling behind, 41-39, with 16 minutes 45 seconds
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a good shot from them," Crimson Tide Coach Mark Gottfried
said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had 21 points and seven assists as the Crimson Tide
survived life at the top for at least one week. Walker had six
blocks, and Emmett Thomas scored 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Crimson Tide, which has won 25 consecutive home games, gets a
week off before playing at Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Before this season, Alabama had never been ranked higher than No.
3, and that lasted a mere two weeks 26 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Every night we've got a big target on our back," guard Antoine
Pettway said. "Everybody's going to try to knock us off now."</TE>
<TE>   Marquis Sykes and Ricky Minard each scored 17 points for Morehead
State (4-4).</TE>
<TE>   Alabama players seemed more excited about the chance to go home
for a few days for Christmas than the No. 1 ranking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a big deal," said Erwin Dudley, who had seven points and
12 rebounds. "We've still got to go out and play. It just makes the
target bigger for us."</TE>
<TE>   The Crimson Tide shot 54.8% from the field in the second half and
committed only seven turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama struggled with its shooting in the first half, but still
led, 37-30, against the undersized and overmatched Eagles.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not big enough or physical enough to where we can stand
there and jump with these guys," said Coach Kyle Macy, a former
Kentucky player.</TE>
<TE>   And Morehead State couldn't keep up with the No. 1 team.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the seniors today I'm proud of them," Gottfried said.
"They came to Alabama when our program was a long way from where it
is now. They've laid the foundation for us."</TE>

<LD>Las Vegas is a graveyard for failed professional sports franchises.
But that doesn't keep investors from flocking to Sin City to try
cashing in on the burgeoning population. With the Arena Football
League's New Jersey Gladiators announcing last week intentions to
relocate to the desert, Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist Joe Hawk
thinks they have a realistic chance at survival, on a smaller scale.</LD>
<LD>   "The way the [XFL's] Outlaws were widely accepted -- by past pro
franchise standards -- in 2001 told me there is a market for such
in-kind ventures in this valley. The Outlaws still might be playing
here, perhaps continuing to average 22,600 fans, had not the league
collapsed under them. It genuinely was a good time for most who
attended the games. So, what's to say it can't be that way for the
Gladiators?</LD>
<LD>   "Team owner Jim Ferraro said at a ... news conference at the
Thomas &amp; Mack Center, the home of the new franchise, that he would
like the Gladiators to average 10,000 fans for its eight home games,
but that 'might be a pipe dream.' Uh, yeah. A crack-pipe dream."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Las Vegas Bowl record for tackles?</TE>
<TE>   Where's the visor? Jacksonville Jaguar running back Fred Taylor
looked across the field Sunday at Tennessee Titan Coach Jeff Fisher
and had a sense of deja vu.</TE>
<TE>   "It begins with their head guy [Fisher]. He's a little bit like
Coach Spurrier," Taylor, who played college ball for Steve Spurrier
at Florida, told the Nashville Tennessean's David Climer. "He has a
little bit of swagger in him, and that carries over to the players.
They fly around and play with confidence. It's like they're geeked up
on something. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's something they're
not telling the NFL about."</TE>
<TE>   Here comes the money: According to Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe,
Timberwolf forward Kevin Garnett, who instigated the latest trend of
high school players jumping to the NBA in 1995, is due some
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   "[Garnett] begat Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady and Rashard Lewis
and Al Harrington and Jonathan Bender and Tyson Chandler and Eddy
Curry," Ryan wrote. "Kevin Garnett should demand a cut of all their
first-year earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] what might have happened if young Kevin Garnett had come
into the NBA and laid a monstrous egg? Suppose he turned out to be
horribly overrated.... Would that have halted the high school
phenomenon right there?"</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Coach Flip Saunders told Ryan, "I'd like to say yes but
I doubt it. Everyone in high school was paying attention. The egos
were too big. There would have been kids out there saying, 'Well, I'm
better than him, anyway,' during those first 30 games, when he wasn't
doing that much."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: USC's Troy Polamalu, who had 20 tackles in a 10-6
loss to Utah last year.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jim Armstrong of the Denver Post breathed a sigh of
relief when he heard the latest news out of the world of severed
heads and cryogenics.</TE>
<TE>   "I see Ted Williams' kids cut a deal in court to keep him
permanently frozen," Armstrong wrote. "You figure they'll at least
have the decency to buy him a hat and gloves for Christmas?"</TE>

<KH>LAS VEGAS BOWL: UCLA vs. NEW MEXICO WEDNESDAY, 1:30 P.M.,
ESPN</KH>
<HD>Odds Aren't in Favor of Bruin Assistants</HD>
<DH>Toledo wasn't only UCLA coach whose future was thrown into
doubt by Guerrero</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>When UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero flicked his finger and
toppled Bob Toledo, eight more dominoes fell.</LD>
<LD>   The lives of the UCLA assistant coaches are in turmoil and their
futures in limbo, yet they are doing their best to prepare the Bruins
for the Las Vegas Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   From his home in Westlake Village where he agonizes over not being
able to coach the Bruins on Christmas Day, Toledo has talked
frequently to his assistants since being dismissed Dec. 9.</LD>
<TE>   "People want the head coach fired but don't realize it affects so
many other families," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad."</TE>
<TE>   Even the most vocal Toledo-basher sympathizes with the assistants,
several of whom have young children. But none of the coaches are
wallowing in self-pity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the nature of coaching," said Phil Snow, the defensive
coordinator. "We all knew what we were in for when we got into this
profession."</TE>
<TE>   Their contracts, worth from $80,000 to $151,000 a year, extend
only through June and they will get not a penny of severance pay.
Most would like to stay under Karl Dorrell, the Denver Bronco
receivers coach who was hired by UCLA last week.</TE>
<TE>   At most, however, only one or two will get his wish.</TE>
<TE>   So they ride along as headless horsemen, continuing to recruit for
future UCLA teams they will not be part of, continuing to coach a
team that is no longer theirs.</TE>
<TE>   A football game awaits, and that's good enough for now.</TE>
<TE>   "Every coach has put in a full day, every day, working really hard
on the game plan," interim Coach Ed Kezirian said.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys care about the kids and aren't slacking off at all."</TE>
<TE>   At game's end, their attention will turn to finding employment.
Many plan to meet with Dorrell. Most are expected to attend the
national coaches' convention in January, a marketplace for unemployed
assistants.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big network of coaches," receivers coach Ron Caragher
said.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's highly competitive. There are more coaches than there
are openings."</TE>
<TE>   If players could supply references, the Bruin assistants would be
hired immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a great staff, guys who know the game and really care
about us as people," senior tight end Mike Seidman said. "I wish
everybody could know how much they mean to the players."</TE>
<TE>   Most assistants are anonymous even in the best of times.</TE>
<TE>   Their fortunes are inextricably linked to the head coach, who
hired them or retained them from a previous regime.</TE>
<TE>   A look at each:</TE>
<TE>   * Phil Snow, defensive coordinator, two years: Until the arrival
of Snow, Toledo changed defensive coordinators the way most men
change ties.</TE>
<TE>   Snow, who turned 47 on Sunday, made an immediate impact last
season. The Bruin defense, led by veterans Robert Thomas, Kenyon
Coleman and Marques Anderson, ranked at the top of the Pacific-10
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   This season, the defense again was strong until the last two
games, when the Bruins surrendered 100 points in losses to USC and
Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   Snow, who turned down an offer from Illinois to take the UCLA job,
lives in Simi Valley with his wife, Debbie, and two sons, ages 13 and
11. Previously he was defensive coordinator at Arizona State for nine
years, and in 1994 was on the same staff as Dorrell.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to ride this out and take my time," said Snow, who has
aspirations of becoming a head coach. "The first thought is to jump
at the first thing that comes up, but I'm not sure I'll do that."</TE>
<TE>   * Kelly Skipper, offensive coordinator, five years: Skipper's
father, Jim, has coached in the college ranks and in the NFL, XFL and
USFL. He currently is an assistant with the Carolina Panthers.</TE>
<TE>   So although his only previous stop besides NFL internships was a
seven-year stint at Fresno State, no assistant should have been more
prepared for the prospect of a new job than Skipper, 35.</TE>
<TE>   "I went through this kind of adjustment many times growing up, and
I understand this is how the business goes," he said. "But every time
our family moved, my dad always made it better."</TE>
<TE>   Now the challenge is his. Skipper's wife, Mary, is due with their
second child Jan. 8.</TE>
<TE>   * Gary Bernardi, tight ends/recruiting, nine years: A holdover
from the Terry Donahue era, Bernardi held together Bruin recruiting
in the three-week period between Donahue's retirement and the hiring
of Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   He has tried to do the same the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm recruiting as if I'm still here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bernardi, 48, who coached at Arizona and USC during a 21-year
Division I career, wants to survive this coaching change as well. He
has a wife, Leigh, and three children."I've invested a lot here," he
said. "I like the players. I want to stay. It would be good for my
family."</TE>
<TE>   * Ron Caragher, receivers/kickers, nine years: Well-liked by
Guerrero and a former UCLA teammate of Dorrell, Caragher is a good
bet to keep his job.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll express an interest in staying," he said. "I do have peace
of mind that things will work out. This is a great university. I came
to this school to be part of something special, to establish
continuity and build the program."</TE>
<TE>   Caragher is married to former Bruin tennis player Wendy Ouwendijk
and the couple has three sons under the age of 7.</TE>
<TE>   "I love UCLA and want to stay, but at the same time it's one man's
opinion," he said, referring to Dorrell. "Does he want me or not?"</TE>
<TE>   * Mark Dove, linebackers, seven years: Dove came in with Toledo
and figures he's going out with him too.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no interest in staying," he said. "If somebody wants to
talk to me I'll listen, but I don't want to be a holdover coach. I've
been here seven years and the quality of my work is apparent."</TE>
<TE>   Dove, 52, and his wife, Julia, have two grown sons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big country and I'm mobile," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I love coaching and I've been doing it for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm at that stage where I have choices outside football too."</TE>
<TE>   * Don Johnson, defensive linemen, three years: This has been a
tough year for Johnson. His son Duane died in an auto accident in
February that also took the life of San Diego Padre outfielder Mike
Darr, a lifelong friend of the Johnson family.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson spent five years at Nevada before coming to UCLA, but
otherwise has always worked in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   His name has surfaced as a candidate for the head coaching
position at Whittier College, but he said he has no interest.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very tough on all the coaches and their families," he
said. "I'm taking it a day at a time and finishing my job here."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, 48, and his wife, Deborah, have three grown children.</TE>
<TE>   * R. Todd Littlejohn, cornerbacks, two years: Littlejohn, 37, and
his wife, Toi-Yan, are expecting their third child in the spring, and
the uncertainty is etched on his normally boyish face.</TE>
<TE>   He was hired by Snow, leaving a position at San Jose State. He has
also coached at Utah State, in the Arena Football League and at
several small colleges.</TE>
<TE>   "I've tried to establish myself here and work hard and gain the
trust of my coordinator," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm willing to move anywhere. This is a tough time to have a baby
on the way."</TE>
<TE>   * John Pearce, quarterbacks, four years: The upbeat, paternal
Pearce, 55, plans to return to Texas with his wife, Jaime, and spend
time with his three grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   After two decades as a head coach at small colleges and high
schools, Pearce was hired at Texas A&amp;M in 1989 by Toledo, the
offensive coordinator. Their friendship grew and Pearce remains his
closest ally at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't trade a moment of my time at UCLA," he said. "A new
coach needs to do what he wants to do, and I understand that."</TE>
<TE>   * Mark Weber, offensive line, six years: Weber will be remembered
for fiercely defending his linemen from criticism and for having them
write letters of appreciation to family and friends before games.</TE>
<TE>   But as far as he's concerned, the memories can wait -- he'd like
to stay.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great place to recruit to, a great place to coach, a
great place to live," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Weber, 45, lives in Simi Valley with his wife, Kathryn, and two
daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "My reasons for wanting to stay are the same as the other
coaches," he said. "We've put our heart and soul into these kids. And
this is going to be a very good football team for years to come."</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Jaric Is Making Most of Chance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If nothing else, a string of injuries to start the season has proved
to the Clippers that they have a versatile player in rookie Marko
Jaric, the only man on the team to start at three positions this
season.</LD>
<LD>   Jaric, a point guard by trade, also has played shooting guard and
small forward. He has been the Clippers' leading scorer the last two
games, with 18 points, nine assists and seven rebounds in Friday's
loss to the Phoenix Suns and 22 points and six steals in Saturday's
victory over the Denver Nuggets.</LD>
<LD>   Since he began starting at shooting guard six games ago, Jaric is
averaging 12 points and six assists. He has been filling in for Eric
Piatkowski, who has been sidelined by a lower abdominal strain since
Dec. 13. Jaric's season averages are eight points and 3.1 assists in
25.6 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   "The only thing we would like to see Marko improve is his
decision-making," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "He's a high-risk player.
He's got to cut down on his turnovers. But what we like is that he's
taking the ball aggressively to the basket."</TE>
<TE>   Jaric had seven turnovers against Phoenix and five against Denver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski said Monday he is uncertain when he will be fit to play
again. The Clippers' next game is Friday against the Suns at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't run yet," he said. "I feel like I'm close. I can jog, but
it hurts me. I'll listen to our trainer Jasen Powell, do my
strengthening exercises, keep my fingers crossed and wake up one
morning feeling great."</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski suffered an abdominal strain in the first quarter of a
Dec. 10 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. The team was reluctant to put
him on the injured list, believing he would be sound before sitting
out the minimum of five games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' five-day break without a game is their longest of
the season, coming at a time when they hope to get a number of
players healthy.</TE>
<TE>   The team hopes to soon have power forward Elton Brand (calf),
small forwards Corey Maggette (knee) and Lamar Odom (ankle), point
guard Andre Miller (ankle), reserve guard Quentin Richardson (ankle)
and Piatkowski sound by the weekend.</TE>

<HD>Raiders Can See the Neon Lights</HD>
<DH>Sanders is put on waivers, paving way for him to join
Oakland. Players would be happy to have him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Retired cornerback Deion Sanders is one step closer to becoming an
Oakland Raider. Now, all the Raiders are asking for is a little good
will -- or at least no ill will -- from the rest of the teams in the
NFL.</LD>
<LD>   Sanders, 35, was put on waivers Monday by the Washington Redskins,
who did so as a favor to the Raiders. But Sanders won't clear waivers
until 1 p.m. today, meaning any team with a worse record than Oakland
(10-5), and sufficient salary-cap space, could block the deal by
claiming him. That team wouldn't be required to sign Sanders, only to
put him on its reserve-retired list. The cap space required is
$210,000 -- one-seventeenth Sanders' 2001 base salary -- but a team
would not need to actually spend anything to acquire his rights as a
retired player.</LD>
<LD>   So there are no financial or competitive disincentives to
tampering with the Raiders' master plan.</LD>
<TE>   That said, it's unclear why anyone would stand in the way of this
deal, regardless of their feeling about the Raiders. Sanders hasn't
played in two seasons, and was a shadow of his former self in his
final season with the Redskins, when he was slowed by a foot injury
and at times was even targeted by opposing quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders have lost their three best cornerbacks to injuries.
Charles Woodson is playing sparingly despite a broken bone in his
right leg; Tory James is sidelined with a similar leg injury; and
rookie Phillip Buchanon is out for the season because of a broken
wrist.</TE>
<TE>   After Sunday's 28-16 victory over Denver, Woodson said he would
not play in Oakland's regular-season finale against Kansas City and
probably would not be ready until the second week of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a shot [before the game Sunday]," Woodson said. "But that
shot probably lasted about five minutes. Right now it's pretty cool,
but as soon as I get up and walk it starts hurting. Hopefully, I get
some time off and we'll get a bye week, and we'll take it from
there."</TE>
<TE>   Woodson said Monday he would welcome the addition of Sanders, who
made seven Pro Bowls and won two Super Bowl rings -- with the 49ers
and Cowboys -- in 12 seasons. Woodson said it doesn't bother him that
Sanders would be hopping aboard so late to share the fruits of a
third-consecutive AFC West title and a potential championship run.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about the Super Bowl, man," Woodson said. "I don't care
about that."</TE>
<TE>   Luring an aging star out of retirement for the playoffs isn't
unprecedented. The 49ers did it with defensive end Charles Haley for
the 1998 postseason, using him as a designated pass-rusher. He then
played a minor role in San Francisco's victory over Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders, a CBS studio analyst the last two seasons, was to visit
Raider headquarters in Alameda on Monday, according to a Bay Area
newspaper report. But the Raiders and Sanders' agent said that report
was inaccurate.</TE>
<TE>   It was Sanders who broke the news of his contact with the Raiders,
doing so Sunday on CBS Sports' "The NFL Today." Later in the day,
Raider Coach Bill Callahan seemed puzzled when asked about Sanders
after the Raider victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?" Callahan asked. "I haven't heard anything about it."</TE>
<TE>   Asked Monday about the Sanders development, Callahan said it was
"speculative" and said he preferred to talk about the strong
performance of defensive backs already on the roster.</TE>
<TE>   But some of those defensive players were happy to talk about the
prospect of playing alongside Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he'll fit in well," safety Rod Woodson said. "I don't
know how much he's working out and all that, but he always stays in
shape. If he does come in here, I think it's a great advantage for
this football team to have him in here."</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Tim Brown said he and his teammates started hearing
whispers last week that Sanders might be on the way, some of them
hearing the rumors even before their coaches heard them.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Eric Barton counts Sanders as one of his football role
models, so playing with him would be a thrill.</TE>
<TE>   "That guy's so spectacular," he said. "Just growing up watching
him, it was, 'OK, what is he going to do now?' every second. He was
just fun to watch."</TE>

<HD>Kjellberg Does Job Quietly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unless you were looking for Patric Kjellberg, you would hardly notice
the Mighty Duck forward on the ice. But the steady efforts of players
such as Kjellberg have helped the Ducks to one of the best starts in
franchise history, five games over .500 at the Christmas break.</LD>
<LD>   "The team is doing really good right now," said Kjellberg, a
six-year NHL veteran and former Swedish Elite League standout. "We're
getting the points that we should be getting."</LD>
<LD>   Kjellberg, acquired by the Ducks from Nashville for Petr Tenkrat
nearly 14 months ago, has three goals and nine points in 29 games.
But big offensive numbers are not why first-year Coach Mike Babcock
has him in the lineup.</LD>
<TE>   After benching Kjellberg for five of the first seven games,
Babcock turned to the reliable veteran and put him on a line centered
by Steve Rucchin during a five-game trip in late October.</TE>
<TE>   Kjellberg has been a regular top-six forward since.</TE>
<TE>   "You always have to have a mix of different type of players on a
line where they all do different things and I think we have that,"
said Kjellberg, who won an Olympic gold medal playing for Sweden in
1994 and was a Stockholm police officer before joining the NHL. "With
me and Rucchin and either [Stanislav] Chistov or Paul [Kariya] ...
the line becomes more dynamic when you have a guy you can set up
for."</TE>
<TE>   Kjellberg, who led the Swedish Elite League with 30 goals in
1997-98, has maintained his spot in the lineup by doing little
things, a solid back-check or set-up pass.</TE>
<TE>   "I like how this season has been going for me," he said. "It's
always nice to have confidence in knowing that you're going to be
playing there for a while."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After two so-so seasons, Kariya, the captain, is back to his
dominating self.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya tied a franchise record with three goals and nine points
over his last three games and has points in eight of his last 10
games (5-9-14). With 15 goals and 35 points, Kariya has bounced back
strong after scoring only 57 points last season.</TE>
<TE>   But Kariya is not getting much recognition in the All-Star game
voting. He is sixth among wingers in the Western Conference and the
top two will be selected to the team. Fans can vote at NHL.com until
Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Mike Commodore was sent back to Cincinnati on Monday
without having played after being recalled from the American Hockey
League team on Saturday.</TE>

<HD>It Turns Into Another Banner Day for Dykstra</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eleanor Dykstra has always liked closely played games, so in fitting
fashion, her 600th career victory last week was a nail-biter, a 46-41
overtime victory over Newport Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   She hopes it's a step toward another Southern Section banner to be
hung on the gym wall at Cerritos Valley Christian, where Dykstra has
taught since the fall of 1968. In her 30th season of coaching
basketball, Dykstra is responsible for 13 of the 25 banners,
including two for softball.</LD>
<LD>   "You've been teaching us a lot of things off the court and on the
court," said Danielle Verhoeven, one of her players, in the postgame
ceremony. "I hope we don't give you too many heart attacks."</LD>
<TE>   Dykstra's record is 600-143. She has seen 32 of her players go on
to play college basketball. She has reached three state championship
games. She even coached the boys' team, as the shooting coach, in
1989-90 when her son, Rick, was on the varsity. That team reached the
Southern California regional finals. She also coached her daughter,
Cindy.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I don't feel like a dinosaur," said Dykstra, who also has 316
wins as a softball coach and 120 in volleyball. She has also coached
track and field. "I'm a student of the game and work really hard at
this."</TE>
<TE>   This year's team, after losing the championship game of the Valley
Christian tournament to Whittier La Serna, 54-52, dropped to 6-4</TE>
<TE>   "What makes her so good is that she's smart," said Orange Lutheran
Coach Tony Matson, who coached against Dykstra last season in the
Olympic League. "If you can make her call a timeout, you've really
accomplished something. She's the queen of the small schools."</TE>
<TE>   And Friday night, after Megan Lovingier scored 17 in the historic
victory, it was good to be queen.</TE>
<TE>   "I get way too much credit for this," she said. "It takes a lot of
good kids, good assistant coaches, a lot of support from school....
I've been so richly blessed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame-bound Crystal Erwin, the 6-foot-3 standout at Santa Fe
Springs St. Paul, didn't play in her team's showdown against
Fullerton Rosary, which doesn't have a player taller than 5-10.</TE>
<TE>   Erwin had been ejected a game earlier against Cerritos and missed
playing against the Royals because of the mandatory one-game
suspension.</TE>
<TE>   "The officials felt she had thrown a punch," St. Paul Coach Robert
Miller said. "I really don't think she did. I think she pushed the
girl away because she was frustrated."</TE>
<TE>   Tenth-ranked Rosary won, 57-19, and won the Los Alamitos
tournament championship to improve to 9-1 behind most valuable player
Jasmine Martin. St. Paul finished the tournament at 8-2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Coach Marcelo Enriquez predicted before the season that
his team would start slow. He was right.</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks lost to San Clemente, 54-35. Nine days later in the
Nike Tournament of Champions, they avenged the loss with a 55-32
victory over the third-ranked Tritons.</TE>
<TE>   "We have six seniors on the team, and I keep reminding them this
is their last go-round," Enriquez said. "This group has been through
two CIF championships, a crushing semifinal upset two years ago, and
went to the state finals last year.</TE>
<TE>   "[The seniors] really wanted to show San Clemente they were much
better than the first time around. Our level of intensity, level of
confidence, was much higher."</TE>
<TE>   Senior guard Krisztina Fuleki had 16 points, five assists and six
rebounds, but it was the Seahawks' balance that was critical. Tyler
Martinook and Christina Scarratt each had eight points as nine
players scored.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo has benefited from the defense of Dominique Harris, a
transfer from Venice.</TE>
<TE>   "She brings some incredible versatility to us," Enriquez said.
"She can guard a post player because of her height [5-10] and
quickness, and she's so quick and athletic we can put her on a very
good guard."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After its first nine games last season under first-year Coach
Holly Pawlowski, Cerritos was 2-7. This year, the team is 7-2, and is
led by six returning players, including seniors Lisa Nuzawa and
Katheryn Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Lauren Kamiyama, a junior, is averaging nine points
and had 100 steals and 100 assists each of the last two seasons.</TE>

<LD>From third grade through eighth grade, J. Drew Smith was home
schooled by his mother. He learned to read, write and do arithmetic
as well as any child his age.</LD>
<LD>   What he liked best about home schooling was recess. He didn't play
kick ball, hand ball or tether ball like the other kids in the
neighborhood schools. His half-hour breaks were reserved for going
into his backyard and shooting baskets.</LD>
<LD>   Those who think he might have become bored with the daily routine
only need to look at his shooting touch. It's as pure as spring water
and the product of constant practice.</LD>
<TE>   "I worked on it every day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, 15, is a 6-foot-7 freshman center at Riverside King High
who plays basketball with the composure of a senior.</TE>
<TE>   In his high school debut Dec. 4 against Whittier, he was the only
King player to never leave the court. For 32 minutes, he played hard,
played smart and never backed away when challenged.</TE>
<TE>   With the game on the line in the final seconds, the most poised
player on the court was Smith. Whittier had a chance to tie the
score, but Smith forced a traveling violation as the buzzer sounded,
preserving a two-point victory for the defending state Division II
champions.</TE>
<TE>   Smith finished with 12 points on five-for-six shooting. He made
two three-point shots and had nine rebounds. His stamina was
stunning. He looked ready to play another game without any rest. And
he had been sick for three days.</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder that King Coach Tim Sweeney said, "He's definitely
one of the best freshmen in the country."</TE>
<TE>   After nine games, Smith is averaging 12.4 points and six rebounds
in helping to lead King to a 6-3 record. He has made 14 three-point
shots and is shooting 65% from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   Smith is a veteran of club basketball, having played in dozens of
youth tournaments before reaching high school. He has focused on
becoming a complete player.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be able to do more than one thing," he said. "I have to
be good to get into a good [college]. That drives me."</TE>
<TE>   The first day of high school was no easy test for Smith. It was
almost a symbolic cutting of the umbilical cord after six years of
individual instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little bit weird," he said. "It was a whole new
experience."</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the unknown factor was how people would respond to
Smith's speech impediment. He stutters. One reason his parents, Rod
and Karen, wanted to keep him home schooled was to make sure he
received individual attention to improve his condition.</TE>
<TE>   "It is getting better," Rod said. "He has expressed himself
through basketball. It's an ongoing problem when you have a
stuttering problem. Even [actor] James Earl Jones, who they say was a
chronic stutterer through high school, has to constantly work at it.
We have told him not everyone is going to understand.</TE>
<TE>   "You turn on the television and hear comedians mimicking people
who stutter. They find that amusing. It's something humorous to
people and some are flat out insensitive. Our whole approach is to
teach him that he's special and this is a challenge to overcome."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Smith's transition has worked out well. He received A's
and Bs on his first report card, and his early basketball
performances leave no doubt that he's going to be playing the sport
for years to come.</TE>

<TE>   D.J. Strawberry of Santa Ana Mater Dei is Coach Gary McKnight's
choice to guard 6-7 LeBron James when Mater Dei takes on Akron (Ohio)
St. Vincent-St. Mary at 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 4 at Pauley Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Strawberry is a 6-5 senior who signed with Maryland. James is
supposed to be the best high school NBA prospect since Bryant.</TE>

was clocked throwing 91 mph last month at a tournament in Florida.
He's a junior at Encino Crespi. Scouts still don't know if he's a

<HD>Allison Rests Injured Knee</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>After proceeding with nary a blip for 2 1/2 weeks, Jason Allison's
comeback from a painful knee injury hit a bump when the Kings'
top-line center sat out the team's 5-0 loss to the St. Louis Blues on
Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Allison tweaked his right knee late in the second period of the
Kings' 3-1 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks on Sunday when he spun to
avoid a defender and fell awkwardly, but he returned in the third
period to assist on the Kings' only goal.</LD>
<LD>   Monday, however, with the Kings playing on consecutive nights for
the third time since Allison's return Dec. 5, his knee was too stiff
to allow him to play.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings have closely monitored Allison's comeback. Originally
expected to be out eight to 12 weeks after he was injured Oct. 29 in
a knee-on-knee collision with Andy Sutton of the Atlanta Thrashers,
Allison returned in five and was more productive than he had been
before he was injured.</TE>
<TE>   In nine games before he was sidelined, Allison had four goals and
seven assists. In nine games since his return, he has one goal and 12
assists.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he was injured only eight weeks ago, and doctors told him
his knee probably wouldn't be fully healed for three months and that
he would experience setbacks that might force him to sit out from
time to time.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to have those moments," Coach Andy Murray said. "He
battles a lot of pain and gets back in there, but this one seemed to
last a little longer."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Derek Armstrong was activated from injured reserve and returned to
the lineup after sitting out six games because of a groin injury.
Adam Deadmarsh was put on the injured list to open a roster spot for
Armstrong.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>With three more regulars on the shelf, including center Jason
Allison, the Kings limped into Savvis Center on Monday night and
staggered out.</LD>
<LD>   Their 5-0 loss in front of 19,993, preceded 24 hours by a 3-1 loss
to the Chicago Blackhawks, wrapped up a two-game trip that was about
as fruitless and pointless as a July trip to the grocery store in
search of eggnog.</LD>
<LD>   Shut out for the first time since March 26, a 42-game stretch not
including the playoffs, the Kings suffered their most lopsided loss
of the season, the Blues breaking open a tight game by scoring four
goals in the third period.</LD>
<TE>   Even with Allison, Erik Rasmussen and Lubomir Visnovsky joining
Adam Deadmarsh, Aaron Miller, Steve Heinze and Ken Belanger on an
expanding injury list, the Kings put 30 shots on goal, but Brent
Johnson turned them all away.</TE>
<TE>   Their power play lacked juice, generating few quality chances
until the final two minutes, by which time the Blues had lost
interest.</TE>
<TE>   The Blues, back home after a 0-2-1 trip that included a 6-2 loss
to the Kings, scored the only goal they needed at 11:53 of the second
period. With rookie Joe Corvo in the penalty box for cross-checking
Doug Weight, Scott Mellanby redirected Weight's shot from the left
point.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the Blues scored two goals with the man advantage, but
it might as well have been four. Twice in the third period, they
scored only three seconds after power plays had ended, Cory Stillman
netting his 12th goal at 1:53 and Pavol Demitra his 10th at 10:38.</TE>
<TE>   On the first, Brad Chartrand was scrambling back onto the ice
after serving an interference penalty. On the second, Brad Norton was
barely back out after serving a high-sticking penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Stillman scored again at 11:53, this one a true power-play goal
with Chris McAlpine in the penalty box for high-sticking.</TE>
<TE>   At even strength, Keith Tkachuk scored the last goal at 18:54.</TE>
<TE>   All things considered, the Kings have had better days. This one
started with the news that Allison, nine games into his comeback from
a knee injury, would have to sit out after tweaking his right knee
Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Rasmussen and Visnovsky sat out because of back injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to find a way," King goaltender Jamie Storr said.
"We have a lot of guys out of the lineup, but you know what? That's
no excuse. We still have to put up points every night. No one feels
sorry for teams that missed the playoffs because they didn't have
their stars all year."</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, the Kings offered little in the way of
self-flagellation afterward, perhaps because as bad as the loss was,
it might have been an improvement over Sunday's, in which the Kings
fell behind, 2-0, after 3 1/2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   They started strongly, but after they failed to put a shot on goal
during a four-minute power play early in the second period, the tide
started to turn.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't say it was a step in the right direction," captain
Mattias Norstrom said, "but I think you saw a little more
[competitiveness] in the team.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough when you look at the end result, but [in Chicago] I
don't think we put ourselves in position to win the game. We were
never really in it. Tonight, we were in the game. They were up, 1-0,
but we were probably the better team at the time. We were outshooting
them, creating more possession in their zone."</TE>
<TE>   Then came the third period.</TE>

that opened when Eric Karros was traded, but McGriff is not as good a

<LD>Whether the Lakers are a good team playing poorly or a poor one
incapable of playing well is up to Coach Phil Jackson and General
Manager Mitch Kupchak to determine, though the answer might not lead
to a solution.</LD>
<LD>   The organization's last in-season trade was almost four years ago,
sending Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell to Charlotte for, basically,
Glen Rice.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers have made three in-season trades in a decade, which, in
part, speaks to the difficulty of finding a partner in what Jackson
calls "our socialist cap structure [that] keeps us in a communist
structure."</LD>
<TE>   So, it is possible that they all are stuck with each other, for
better or worse, with 11 victories in going on two months, with
Sacramento in town Wednesday and the frustration gathering in a
locker room impatient with the losing.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday the disappointment found Robert Horry, just as it had
Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal before him. Horry was disgusted by
the seemingly unshakable complacency.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he assumed the Lakers were a capable team not playing to
its potential, Horry said, "Do I assume? I don't want to make any
assumptions."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers so rarely offer the routine -- or what came to be
accepted as routine in their three championship seasons -- one
suspicious victory now coming for every two spectacular defeats, the
assumptions built over three years losing clarity by the day.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they hang in there, willing to believe that the small
successes are growth, to dismiss the failures as temporary,
ever-resilient souls in a game that rewards 45-win seasons with
playoff opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, they have O'Neal, the only player who can't be guarded if
he really, seriously doesn't want to be.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if they would make the jump shots that would get the
triple-teams off him....</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go on record, saying I'm not tired of winning," Rick
Fox said. "I'm not bored. I'm very proud to be a Laker and proud of
my teammates and I recognize where we are as a group, what we did for
three years."</TE>
<TE>   Fox also said, however, that it was time to return to the system
that had brought them success, an implication that they'd misplaced
their loyalties to Jackson and the triangle.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, you have to step out of the shadows of Phil's
previous teams and make your own history," he said. "We've definitely
taken his lead from the day he walked in here. We believe he had the
road map and we'd follow like soldiers with blinders on."</TE>
<TE>   Triangle, here they come.</TE>
<TE>   "It may seem boring," Fox said. "It's darn sure a lot better than
losing games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At a Sunday morning shoot-around at Air Canada Centre, Fox and
Brian Shaw bet $60 on the outcome of a game in which each took three
shots at the basket while sitting on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   After one round and six misses, they doubled the bet. After Fox
missed again, Shaw, a frequent winner in half-court shooting
contests, made his shot.</TE>
<TE>   When Shaw tried to collect, Fox, with a grin, offered $80. See,
Fox explained, since the bet was made in Canada, Shaw's $120, with
the exchange rate, was worth about $40 less.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw laughed and said he'd accept the $80, "if your next paycheck
comes in Canadian dollars."</TE>

<DH>Laker forward believes Christie orchestrated their
preseason fight</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was the moment Rick Fox knew he'd been had, used by Doug
Christie in the early minutes of that October exhibition game.</LD>
<LD>   Tucked between the short jab that hit his chin and the sneak
attack that would cost him more than a quarter-million dollars, six
basketball games and a measure of his reputation, it came to him,
when he turned and saw Christie ... pleased.</LD>
<LD>   He is sure of it two months later, maybe more now than he was
then, having had time for the doubt to roll in and out of his head,
unwilling to believe that Christie might be so calculating, before
seeing it again, clearer than before.</LD>
<TE>   Fox, days from standing on the same floor as Christie and his
Sacramento King teammates for the first time since, grits his perfect
white teeth and recalls, "Tick ... tick ... tick ... snap!"</TE>
<TE>   Then Fox left the floor, bound for he knew not what, something
like revenge for the punch, something like honor for the organization
-- it was all twisted together -- driven by what he estimated as four
minutes of rage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fox would not let up on the Kings last spring, through the
seven-game Western Conference finals, among the most gripping series
the Lakers have ever played.</TE>
<TE>   He reminded them often of their failures against the Lakers,
including the sweep the season before, of the banners that hung in
Los Angeles and not in their arena, of how the Lakers knew how to
win.</TE>
<TE>   So it was Fox, perceived as being along for Shaquille O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant's ride, who became despised, particularly after the
Lakers went to Sacramento and won Game 7 in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, Christie admitted the pressure of the series was
more than he could bear, telling the Sacramento Bee that he was
"scared to death" in the waning minutes of the final game.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were amazed at Christie's confession. O'Neal, who
already had called the Kings "Queens," ridiculed him. Many wondered
if Christie, the rangy guard who'd often been assigned to defend
Bryant and had become conspicuous by obediently waving to his wife in
the stands, hadn't lost his teammates for good.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 25 at Staples Center, the Lakers played the Kings in their
final exhibition game. They were without O'Neal, who'd had surgery
six weeks before, but they'd played without him before and generally
won as often as not.</TE>
<TE>   Two minutes and 7 seconds into the game, Christie moved in on Fox,
who swung the basketball over his head, knocking Christie to the
floor with his elbow. As Christie sat, Fox allowed the ball to roll
from his hands, at Christie, who smacked it back at Fox.</TE>
<TE>   As the crowd stirred and players and referees arrived at a
situation escalating, Fox shoved Christie away, in the face. Christie
countered with the short left punch that struck Fox squarely on the
point of his jaw, and then they were separated.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know Doug Christie," Fox said. "So it'd be hard to say I
have a dislike for him. I have a problem with somebody punching me in
the jaw. I dislike that part. But I don't really know him. He's a
Sacramento King. And, obviously, the Sacramento Kings have been
pretty good to us the last few years. So it'd be hard for me to hate
him."</TE>
<TE>   See, they can't help themselves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A few dozen people milled around on the floor in the moments after
the incident, the Kings near their bench and the Lakers near theirs,
three officials huddled in the middle, sorting through the drama.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, who was standing near Phil Jackson at the time, recalls
thinking, "He's getting kicked out. I'm staying in the game. He
punched me. I'm not going to run around, look like a fool trying to
chase him down. I'm never going to get there anyway. There must be 10
people between him and me. I'll see him again."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, referee Bill Spooner approached Fox and Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "Rick," he said, "you're going to be gone. So is Christie."</TE>
<TE>   Fox was stunned.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy threw the ball at me. Charged me. I push him away and he
throws a punch that hits me in the jaw. And now you're kicking me out
of the game?"</TE>
<TE>   Out of curiosity, Fox, having for the moment forgotten his role in
this spat, looked over Spooner's shoulder and found Christie.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In 11-plus NBA seasons, Rick Fox at times has been a scorer, but
was most useful as a system guy -- eager to play defense and toil
within the offense if it meant victories. With the Lakers, it meant
more than that. It meant championships, so he threw himself into the
role, often becoming an accomplished irritant.</TE>
<TE>   He came to expect retaliation. He played to annoy other players,
to push them into an edgy pace. The elbow to the neck was a
compliment, then. The shove in the back was exactly what he had hoped
for.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I kind of deserved it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It came as a shock, then, when it was he who had been played. Not
exactly as he'd done, but close. Maybe Christie hadn't taken the
floor intending to rescue his reputation and take Fox with him, but
he wouldn't pass on the opportunity, either, Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   So, when he saw Christie standing at the other end of the floor,
not 80 feet away, dribbling the basketball between his legs, flipping
it at the rim, the moment had arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost like he was this little proud Cheshire cat, that
he'd gotten away with something," Fox said. "I was composed up until
the time I turned around. If he had been standing there, concerned
too, then I probably would have been OK. The fact that he was so
proud of himself, you could just see it was, like, 'Finally, maybe my
teammates will respect me now.'</TE>
<TE>   "When you add up all of it, he came in there and felt like, in the
eyes of his teammates, they'd respect him. And I could see it in his
face. I literally turned, I didn't even wait for them to say, 'You
gotta go.' I just turned. My first thought was, 'He's got to come
down that tunnel. I know it. They're going to go tell him and I'm
going to be there to talk to him.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He arrived in time, of course, racing through the tunnel, down a
hallway and emerging on the other side, in plenty of time to ambush
the departing Christie. The Kings' bench flooded into the tunnel to
defend Christie, and O'Neal, in street clothes, arrived a few moments
later.</TE>
<TE>   No one was hurt. Christie was suspended for two games, Fox for
six. The season started, the Kings playing much closer to their
potential than the Lakers to theirs. The final conversations that
night were of the Christmas Day game, the next time the Lakers and
Kings would share a floor, and now it is nearly upon them.</TE>
<TE>   Fox sat Sunday on a metal chair he unfolded in Toronto's Air
Canada Centre, in a gray hallway not unlike the one at Staples
Center. He said he wished he had left it on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's good there was two months between it," he said.
"I'll tell you, I think it'll always be an issue. I can't speak for
him. But I think it will always be an issue because of what I found
out about myself. So, there's a side of me that's not comfortable
with that. I'm a control freak, big time. I need to be under control.
I like to control my surroundings. Obviously, being punched, I don't
do well.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing's premeditated. I won't enter that game with the thought,
'I've got to get him back.' To me, when we step on the floor on
Christmas Day, it's about basketball. If he and I bump into each
other, I'm not going to swing at him. And I don't expect him to swing
at me."</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, he could, of course, reach out to shake
Christie's hand. Christie might refuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what I'm going to do," Fox said. "I don't. Just
talking about it right now, I can feel it.... It only takes one
thing. I don't in any way want that incident to reoccur. Or, in any
way, for it to be more than basketball. I've had people, over the
last two months, tell me, 'Way to get him. You kicked his [butt].'
And others tell me, 'You got your [butt] kicked.' Everyone has an
opinion, but no one talks about the fact it was terrible for
basketball, for both of us. So, all that stuff I've heard for two
months, I'm always thinking, 'That's not what this should be about
here.'</TE>
<TE>   "Two months has been great. I've been able to let it die down.
Now, if I can't sleep Christmas Eve, if I go home and I'm nasty to
the wife and kids, obviously there's something still underneath
there. But, I'd like to be the bigger person and be able to let it go
and be a basketball player."</TE>

<DH>Tulane's Losman, once UCLA's quarterback of the future,
looks back on his past</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>NEW ORLEANS -- On Christmas Eve, Tulane quarterback J.P. Losman can
think of nothing better than to be still playing football. The Green
Wave, the team that he now leads, is playing Christmas Day in the
Hawaii Bowl in Honolulu against the hometown Hawaii Warriors.</LD>
<LD>   There is a bit of a twist to all of this. UCLA will be also be
playing Wednesday, the Bruins facing New Mexico in the Las Vegas
Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   For Losman, the scenario works out just right. He has his team in
a bowl game in his first season as a starter. And he won't be tempted
to look at what might have been.</LD>
<TE>   "I still talk about UCLA sometimes," said the redshirt junior, who
transferred three years ago. "But I have no regrets. I'm glad I left
and made that decision."</TE>
<TE>   Losman arrived in Westwood the spring of 1999 as a prized recruit
out of Venice High. He was part of the strongest quarterback class
that Southern California had produced in many years, a class that
also yielded Kyle Boller and Chris Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   It appeared to be the ideal situation. Losman had been a Bruin fan
as long as he could remember. He had nearly every kind of UCLA
apparel and souvenir in his bedroom. Now he was attending the school
of his dreams.</TE>
<TE>   As a fresh-faced 17-year-old high school junior, he was so focused
on the Bruins that he committed to them after attending their one-day
camp for recruits. He graduated early to get ready for spring
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody [offering a scholarship] was a joke to me," he said. "I
was just waiting on UCLA. I went to their camp and then they called
me into their office.</TE>
<TE>   "I was waiting for it to happen and it did happen. I said yes and
that was it."</TE>
<TE>   Losman shocked everyone months later by announcing he was leaving
school before fall practice. The decision was made even before he had
worked his way into a crowded mix at the position.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches didn't hide their displeasure. They'd lost Boller to
California only because they'd targeted Losman and got him. Soon the
kid who grew up a short distance from Spaulding Field was labeled a
player that wanted everything too fast and couldn't handle
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "We picked another quarterback and it was a big mistake on our
part," UCLA Coach Bob Toledo told The Times a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo is no longer the coach, having been fired Dec. 9, largely
because of late-season collapses and a string of player
transgressions. But instability at quarterback didn't help his
situation.</TE>
<TE>   The quarterbacks in that same camp could never quite follow
All-American Cade McNown. Cory Paus fared the best but was often
injured and kept a drunk-driving conviction hidden from Toledo. Scott
McEwan was a career backup. Ryan McCann transferred to Division I-AA
Tennessee Chattanooga. Drew Bennett, who is a receiver with the
Tennessee Titans, simply wasn't a quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Losman thought he should have been the guy. "I knew they were
going to have quarterback problems," he said. "I've talked with guys
on that team and they have been telling me that I was stupid for
leaving. I just tell them that wasn't the reason why I left.</TE>
<TE>   "They were always changing offensive coordinators. You could tell
that something wasn't right with all those guys. I saw that and I had
to get up and move out."</TE>
<TE>   Losman said the competition at quarterback wasn't a problem. But
he acknowledges he wasn't as mature then and wished he had done
things differently. If he had the same situation over again, he
wouldn't be so impatient, would go on other recruiting trips, instead
of jumping at the first offer.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just rely on one thing," he said. "It's like getting
married. The first one you meet is not always going to be the one you
marry."</TE>
<TE>   But the strong-armed prospect also found he couldn't step right in
when he got to Tulane. Ahead of him was Patrick Ramsey, now a rookie
starter for the Washington Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   Tulane offensive coordinator Frank Scelfo says the 6-foot-3,
215-pound Losman has the athletic gifts to get him to the NFL. He
calls Losman one of the hardest workers on the team and lauds his
willingness to find ways to improve himself.</TE>
<TE>   However, Losman also had to learn how to handle a situation that
wasn't tailor-made for him.</TE>
<TE>   "We started Patrick Ramsey but J.P. really pushed him," Scelfo
said. "He was always knocking on the door but couldn't quite get a
starting job. But I think it made him a better player and it made
Patrick a better player.</TE>
<TE>   "I can only judge him by the time he's been here. He's done
everything that we've asked of him and he was never one to whine or
complain."</TE>
<TE>   It has been an uneven season for Losman. He has solid statistics
-- 2,228 yards and 19 touchdowns against 10 interceptions -- but the
Green Wave hasn't been as explosive as in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Chris Scelfo said injuries to his top two receivers and an
inexperienced offensive line contributed to the quarterback's erratic
play. Chris Scelfo said Losman has had to "play above and beyond"
himself and that he could be in for a big year next season.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Bruins played much of this year with freshmen Matt
Moore and Drew Olson after Paus broke his ankle Oct. 19. There's the
lingering thought that Losman could have been an experienced senior
at UCLA with a more talented cast around him. Maybe he could have
been the All-American he and his family dreamed of.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it could have affected Toledo's future as well. Since that
10-2 season with McNown in 1998, the Bruins have been 24-22.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never know, huh?" Losman said with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Steelers Complete Paperwork</HD>
<DH>They back up Flowers' tough talk for second year in a row,
beating Tampa Bay, 17-7, after players scuffle during pregame
warmups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Well, Lee Flowers was right. They are paper champions. On the field
Monday night, however, they looked like something less.</LD>
<LD>   One day after backing into the NFC South title by virtue of the
New Orleans Saints' loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, Tampa Bay was
beaten by the Pittsburgh Steelers, 17-7, in a game that was decided
when Shaun King was named the Buccaneers' starting quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   The victory clinched the AFC North for Pittsburgh (9-5-1) and left
Tampa Bay (11-4) needing help to secure a first-round bye in the
playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   It's no surprise that King, who was subbing for starter Brad
Johnson (severe lower-back bruise), couldn't do much with the
football in his hand. He has struggled throughout a disappointing
career.</TE>
<TE>   What was surprising was how ineffective the Buccaneer defense --
best in the league overall and best against the pass, with fewest
points allowed -- looked against the Steelers.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers, a Pittsburgh defensive back, had labeled the Buccaneers
"paper champions" after Pittsburgh beat them last season. In the days
leading up to Monday night's game, Buccaneer defensive tackle Warren
Sapp had responded with a trash-talk barrage directed against
Flowers.</TE>
<TE>   The bad feelings got even uglier during pregame warmups with
Pittsburgh running back Jerome Bettis bumping Sapp as he exhorted the
early arrivals among the Raymond James Stadium crowd of 65,684 to be
demonstrative in their support. Buccaneer receiver Keyshawn Johnson
scuffled with several Steelers.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, they walked all over us during warmups," said Bettis,
"and we wanted to let them know we were going to bully them in their
own house."</TE>
<TE>   "The intensity on that field was as great as any playoff game,"
said Steeler Coach Bill Cowher. And he was only talking about the
pregame warmups. "These were two teams which had a genuine dislike
for each other."</TE>
<TE>   Once the game started, Pittsburgh had the final say.</TE>
<TE>   Steeler quarterback Tommy Maddox set the tone on the very first
play from scrimmage by hitting Plaxico Burress on a 41-yard
completion. Maddox continued to move his team down the field and the
Steelers scored on his 11-yard touchdown pass to Antwaan Randle El.
The Pittsburgh receiver avoided two Buccaneers, safety Dexter Jackson
and cornerback Ronde Barber, in diving across the goal line in the
left corner of the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Enter King, who had thrown only one pass all season. When King
became Tampa Bay's starting quarterback in 1999 after an injury to
Trent Dilfer, then-coach Tony Dungy had compensated for King's
passing problems by limiting his aerial game and concentrating on
short passes. King had entered this season with a 77.2 career passer
rating.</TE>
<TE>   King's first two passes Monday were caught, but the second one,
intended for Keyshawn Johnson in the right flat, ended up in the
wrong hands. Pittsburgh cornerback Chad Scott intercepted it and
raced 30 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   With only 3 minutes 50 seconds elapsed, the Steelers led, 14-0.</TE>
<TE>   While King couldn't right the Buccaneers' ship, Maddox found
smooth sailing through the Tampa Bay defense. He completed his first
seven passes for 152 yards. Tampa Bay came into the game having given
up an average of 151.7 per game.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh's second drive ended with a 26-yard Jeff Reed field
goal.</TE>
<TE>   After King had completed only nine of 26 for 73 yards, Buccaneer
Coach Jon Gruden inserted Rob Johnson in the third quarter. This
Johnson finally got his team on the scoreboard in the final two
minutes with an 18-yard touchdown pass to Keyshawn Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave up some uncharacteristic big plays," said Gruden, whose
team finished with only 277 yards of total offense and committed
three turnovers. "You pretty much get what you deserve in this
business and we got it tonight. But we're still in the thick of this
thing."</TE>
<TE>   That's true. If Tampa Bay beats the Chicago Bears in next week's
regular-season finale and the Green Bay Packers lose to the New York
Jets, the Buccaneers can still get a first-round bye.</TE>
<TE>   If the Steelers beat the Baltimore Ravens next week and the
Oakland Raiders (who play Kansas City) and the Tennessee Titans
(Houston Texans) both lose, Pittsburgh can still have the AFC's best
record and home-field advantage all the way to the conference
championship.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing, man, one little comment can change your whole
life," Flowers said afterward. "I couldn't sleep all week; I put the
pressure on this team. If we lost this game, everyone and their
mothers were going to be after me.</TE>
<TE>   "Tampa Bay is a great team and they are going to go to the Super
Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   He rolled his eyes when he said that.</TE>

<HD>Nowitzki Rescues Mavericks Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The way the Dallas Mavericks played their first 24 games, even they
were starting to think little could go wrong. The last three games
have provided a reality check.</LD>
<LD>   Dirk Nowitzki bailed Dallas out of another bad shooting game,
scoring 10 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter as the Mavericks
defeated the Washington Wizards, 92-86, Monday night at Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   "We all know what's going on -- we've been lackadaisical, fooling
ourselves a little bit," said reserve Walt Williams. "Everyone
expects us to score 100 every night. But if we want to be an elite
team, we've got to learn to grind it out like this."</LD>
<TE>   The Mavericks were averaging more than 106 points a game until
scoring 80 in a victory at Denver, then 81 against Utah in their
first home loss.</TE>
<TE>   After Jerry Stackhouse's three-point basket pulled Washington to
within one with 5 minutes 57 seconds remaining, Nowitzki answered by
making a jump shot as the shot clock expired, then put back a rebound
to make it 84-79. The Wizards wouldn't get any closer again.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan had 13 points for the Wizards, but made only five
of 15 shots from the field.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as pretty as it was earlier, but we're still finding
ways to win," said Dallas' Nick Van Exel, who made up for a
one-of-seven shooting performance with eight rebounds and six
assists.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 99, New Orleans 94 -- Tim Duncan scored 29 points and
tied a career high with 23 rebounds to help the Spurs win in overtime
at San Antonio. Bruce Bowen tied a career high with 21 points for the
Spurs, who have won four in a row. New Orleans, which rallied from a
16-point second-quarter deficit, made only two of 11 from the field
in overtime and didn't score in the final 3:15 of the extra period.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 89, Seattle 88 -- Stephon Marbury, who made two of his
first 11 field goals, made a leaning 13-foot shot with a half-second
remaining for the decisive points to lead the Suns at Phoenix. After
a timeout, the SuperSonics had a chance to win. Brent Barry threw an
inbounds lob from half court to the basket for Desmond Mason, but
Shawn Marion blocked the shot as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 108, Orlando 103 -- Ray Allen had 35 points, including a
three-point basket with 1:16 remaining, as the Bucks took advantage
of Tracy McGrady's absence to win at Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Every time Orlando threatened down the stretch, Allen responded.
Two free throws by Orlando's Mike Miller cut the Milwaukee lead to
97-95 with 1:44 remaining, but Allen made a three-point basket 28
seconds later. Orlando's Shawn Kemp made two free throws after that,
but Allen followed with an off-balance shot to put the Bucks up,
102-97, with 47.3 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 112, Atlanta 97 -- Al Harrington scored a career-high 40
points, Brad Miller had 22 points and 11 rebounds and Ron Artest had
24 points to lead the Pacers at Indianapolis. Jamaal Tinsley had 14
assists for the Pacers, who improved to 13-1 at home.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 96, Houston 91 -- Karl Malone scored 10 of his 31 points in
the fourth quarter -- including six in the last 1:30 -- to help the
Jazz rally from a seven-point deficit to win at Houston. Matt
Harpring had eight of his 25 points in the fourth quarter as the Jazz
won its third consecutive game. Steve Francis had 26 points and Yao
Ming had 18 points and seven rebounds for Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 74, Miami 72 -- Cleveland rookie Smush Parker's
three-point play keyed an 11-2 game-ending spurt and Miami's Eddie
Jones missed a driving layup with 4.5 seconds remaining as the
Cavaliers won at Cleveland. Ricky Davis scored 33 points to lead the
Cavaliers, who snapped a four-game losing skid.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 99, Chicago 83 -- Lucious Harris scored nine of his 20
points during the game-breaking third quarter to help the Nets win
their 10th in a row at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>

<HD>The Masters Invitations Go Out in Holiday Mail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The final world golf ranking of the year was published Monday and set
in motion a holiday tradition like no other: Masters invitations are
in the mail.</LD>
<LD>   The 87 players who already qualified include a record 39
foreign-born players and 10 professionals who will be making their
first trip to Augusta National, such as PGA champion Rich Beem and
rookie Jonathan Byrd, who grew up in Elgin, S.C.</LD>
<LD>   "Augusta is the closest tournament to my house, and I can't wait
to get in," Byrd said after winning the Buick Challenge, which helped
him finish 39th on the PGA Tour money list.</LD>
<TE>   Among those not on the invitation list are Tom Lehman, Paul
Azinger and Mark Calcavecchia, who will have a chance to qualify for
the Masters during the first three months of next season.</TE>
<TE>   The final field will not be determined until after The Players
Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Augusta National changed its qualifying criteria three years ago
to rely more on the world ranking and PGA Tour money list, meaning
the majority of the field is determined three months before the
Masters, scheduled for April 10-13.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods, who will try to become the first player to win three
consecutive green jackets, is among 20 former champions in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the list is six-time winner Jack Nicklaus, who didn't play
last year because of back problems, and three-time champion Gary
Player, who will be in the Masters for the final time because of a
new policy effective in 2004 that allows only former champions 65 and
younger to play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An unidentified man suspected of stealing golf equipment --
including three wedges belonging to Woods -- during the Target World
Challenge earlier this month apparently won't be prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   The clubs were returned after the man was identified by security
guards. But it appears sheriff's deputies will take no legal action.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County sheriff's Detective Brian Richmond said: "I was
informed the victims had received their property and they are no
longer interested in prosecution. Case closed."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball</TE>
<TE>   Brian Anderson, who last appeared in a Cleveland uniform during
the 1997 World Series, will return to pitch for his hometown team
next year. Anderson, 30, and the Indians agreed to a one-year
contract. He went 6-11 with a 4.79 earned-run average for Arizona in
2002.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland also agreed to a minor league contract with catcher A.J.
Hinch, who hit .249 in 72 games for Kansas City last season with
seven home runs and 27 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox had top officials in
Nicaragua on Monday, the first day free-agent pitcher Jose Contreras
could start contract talks with major league teams.</TE>
<TE>   Contreras was the top pitcher on Cuba's national team before he
defected in October.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Athletics signed center fielder Chris Singleton to a
one-year contract with a club option for 2004. Terms were not
disclosed.... The San Diego Padres signed catcher Gary Bennett to a
one-year contract, after Colorado declined to offer him a contract.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   No penalty was imposed on Oracle of San Francisco, even though a
jury at Auckland, New Zealand, ruled the syndicate broke America's
Cup rules by using a sophisticated radar system during races.</TE>
<TE>   The jury's decision was a response to nine formal questions from
OneWorld and other challengers about the use of radar by Oracle.
While determining that the use of any instruments capable of
transmitting and receiving signals during a race is expressly
forbidden, jury chairman Bryan Willis said the jury had not
determined what Oracle's radar was used for or capable of because it
wasn't asked to.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State wrestling Coach Bobby Douglas was appointed coach of
the 2003 U.S. freestyle team that will compete at next year's world
championships in New York.</TE>

<HD>As the Rumors Swirl, Campo Stays Upbeat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although his status as coach of the Dallas Cowboys is shaky, Dave
Campo remained upbeat Monday and tried lifting the spirits of
everyone around him, too.</LD>
<LD>   He told players in a team meeting that they should tune out all
the talk about him being fired and Bill Parcells possibly being
hired. Parcells met with owner Jerry Jones for five hours last week,
though both sides said no job was offered.</LD>
<LD>   Campo wants his players' attention squarely on extending a 10-game
winning streak against Washington, Dallas' opponent in the season
finale Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "His demeanor has been the same," running back Emmitt Smith said.
"He's been on an even keel, trying to stay positive, trying to not
lose focus."</TE>
<TE>   Campo said Sunday he wasn't sure if or how he'd discuss his job
status with the team. Figuring it was too big to ignore, he brought
it up in a meeting Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Campo said he kept it brief: "Don't let the distraction be a
distraction, just go about your business and get done what you have
to get done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Ram quarterback Marc Bulger will miss the team's final
game Monday night because of a spinal injury that will not require
surgery or harm his career.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger was hurt when he was sacked early in Sunday's 30-10 loss at
Seattle. The spinal injury was described as three compression
fractures.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Matava, one of the team physicians, said Bulger should be
healthy in six to eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Backup Jamie Martin, who played most of Sunday's game, had his
knee drained and is questionable for the home game against San
Francisco. That would leave Scott Covington as the Rams' only healthy
quarterback. Opening day starter Kurt Warner went on injured reserve
with a hand injury earlier this month and is out for the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eagle Coach Andy Reid said quarterback A.J. Feeley, who is 4-0 as
a starter, will start again Saturday against the New York Giants
because Koy Detmer is not ready to play yet. Philadelphia can clinch
home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs with a victory over
the Giants.... Cincinnati safety Mark Roman aggravated torn cartilage
in his right knee during the Bengals' 20-13 victory over New Orleans
and will miss the final game of the season.... Atlanta fullback Bob
Christian will not play this weekend because of a concussion he
suffered Sunday, and he acknowledged that this second concussion in
two months could end his career.... Brian Griese's sprained left knee
was still sore Monday, but the Denver Broncos will not know until
later this week whether their quarterback will play in Sunday's
finale against Arizona.</TE>

<HD>Roenick Returns, Flyers Tie Ottawa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeremy Roenick and the Philadelphia Flyers fought their way back
twice to claim a hard-earned point.</LD>
<LD>   Simon Gagne scored early in the third period, and the visiting
Flyers salvaged a 2-2 tie Monday night with the surging Ottawa
Senators in the second game of a home-and-home series.</LD>
<LD>   Ottawa, which won, 3-1, Saturday night in Philadelphia, is
undefeated (3-0-1) in its last four games and 15-2-4 since a 7-1 loss
Nov. 9 in Boston.</LD>
<TE>   The Flyers, 4-1-1 in their last six games, tied it on Gagne's
sixth goal. Roenick, making his return from a two-game suspension,
stole the puck from Daniel Alfredsson at center ice and fed Gagne,
who fired a shot over Patrick Lalime's left shoulder at 5:16.</TE>
<TE>   Todd White and Shaun Van Allen scored for Ottawa. Michal Handzus
had the other Philadelphia goal.</TE>
<TE>   Lalime made 28 saves -- including a good one on Gagne with seconds
left in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 3, Tampa Bay 0 -- Olaf Kolzig made 40 saves for his
first shutout this season as the Capitals won at Washington to
stretch their unbeaten streak to four games.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington streak has coincided with Kolzig's return after
missing four games because of a groin injury. He has given up only
six goals in four games since his return.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 1, Columbus 0 -- Curtis Joseph stopped 33 shots and Kris
Draper scored on a rebound with 4:27 remaining as the Red Wings won
at Columbus, Ohio. The shutout was Joseph's third this season and the
39th of his career.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 2, New York Rangers 2 -- Mike Dunham stopped 40 shots
and Richard Lintner scored the tying goal in the third period to help
the Rangers earn a point at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Atlanta 1 -- Alexander Mogilny scored three goals as
the Maple Leafs extended their home unbeaten streak to 10 games.
Mogilny got two of his goals on breakaways, helping him post his
second hat trick this season and the 17th of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Buffalo 2 -- Mario Lemieux scored one goal and set
up three others in the final nine minutes to help the Penguins rally
after trailing, 2-1, at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 5, Vancouver 3 -- Rob Blake had two goals and an assist
to help the Avalanche win at Denver for its third consecutive victory
under new Coach Tony Granato.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 5, San Jose 2 -- John Grahame made 25 saves and Joe
Thornton had a goal and an assist to help the Bruins snap a six-game
winless streak with a victory at Boston. The Bruins started 19-4-3-1,
but their last win came against the New York Rangers on Dec. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 3, Florida 2 -- David Legwand scored a power-play goal
42 seconds into overtime to help the Predators win at Sunrise, Fla.,
only their fourth road victory.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 3, Minnesota 2 -- Blake Sloan and Craig Berube scored 49
seconds apart in the second period to break a 1-1 tie for the Flames
at St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 3, Montreal 1 -- Dave Scatchard's goal with
5:36 left broke a 1-1 tie and the Islanders added an empty-net goal
to in their victory at Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>

<HD>Granato Puts In Wake-Up Call</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Colorado Avalanche had endured slow starts before, but one player
or another had always ignited a surge that carried the team to the
top of the division. This season's slumber was different.</LD>
<LD>   "After Game 20, I was wondering if it was over," General Manager
Pierre Lacroix said, "and after Game 30, when it wasn't over, I said,
'Something is wrong.'</LD>
<LD>   "You don't do things on emotion. I went deep in my reflection and
realized we can't be flat and remain so flat. Last year, two or three
teams were over 90 points and didn't make the playoffs. So there was
no chance to be taken here."</LD>
<TE>   Just as Lacroix saw firing Bob Hartley as the logical solution, he
saw promoting assistant coach Tony Granato as the next step, even
though Granato's coaching experience consisted of four months beside
Hartley.</TE>
<TE>   "It was right in front of me," Lacroix said. "Look at his
background and the perception people have of Tony Granato. He has all
the attributes and assets of a real leader. He has a big heart. He's
a polished guy. And even though he's energetic, he will take time for
deep reflection and make the right decision."</TE>
<TE>   During 13 NHL seasons, half with the Kings, Granato was known less
for deep thinking than scrappiness and enthusiasm. He was an
agitator, a pest, but he never took a night off. And as a coach, he
expects the same emotional investment from players he considers
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Careful to praise Hartley, whom Lacroix referred to as "the
previous coach," Granato plans no major changes and hopes to make the
game enjoyable again for a talented but seemingly unmotivated group.</TE>
<TE>   "I just said, 'This is a fresh start for everybody. Let's start
the season right now, as far as the direction we're going and the
time of the season,' " Granato said Monday before he improved to 3-0
with a 5-3 victory against Vancouver. "You can't come in here and
make a statement. There's not much this team needs to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we weren't playing up to our capabilities. We've played a
ton of games and have been there when it counted. To tell them, 'This
one is a must-win' every game, you can't do that. We were a little
stale, and it certainly wasn't Bob's fault. There just needed to be a
shakeup to clear the air."</TE>
<TE>   Although Granato's lack of coaching experience could be a pitfall,
he's not fazed.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I excited nervous? Yes. Fearing failure? Not at all," said
Granato, who retired after the 2000-01 season. "I'm very confident,
comfortable and excited. How could you not be? Look at the roster and
the people around me. Look at what Pierre will do to make it better.</TE>
<TE>   "I go out in the hall and look at the pictures of the two teams
that won the Cup, and there isn't anyone who can prove to me this
isn't a better group. Patrick [Roy] is at the top of his game. So are
Joe [Sakic], Peter [Forsberg], Rob [Blake] and Adam Foote. And we
have great kids in [Radim] Vrbata and Steven Reinprecht. We have
everything and more we had on those other two teams. We have to
perform."</TE>
<TE>   Lacroix, who said the job is Granato's "as long as he likes it,"
also said Granato's close relationship with Blake was not a
hindrance.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything, I think the locker room will have a better
understanding of who he is," Lacroix said.</TE>
<TE>   Granato agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had coaches who I considered great friends, like Barry
Melrose in L.A.," he said. "To say you have to keep your friendships
separate, no, I will not do that."</TE>
<TE>   As long as he wins, they'll all be his friends. Lacroix took a big
chance, but the Avalanche is a largely veteran team that needs
coaxing more than it needs chalk talks. If this works, it won't be
the first unexpected success for Granato.</TE>
<TE>   Sabre Rattling</TE>
<TE>   The Buffalo Sabres' future got darker last week, when Commissioner
Gary Bettman said the club could fold or move unless prospective
owners Mark Hamister and Todd Berman got state or local financial
aid. With New York Gov. George Pataki saying state help is unlikely,
and Hamister saying he must have about $15 million to improve an
arena that opened only six years ago, Chapter 11 bankruptcy and a
stalemate are looming.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL has operated the Sabres since June, when owner John Rigas'
Adelphia cable empire crumbled. The Hamister-Berman group has a Jan.
3 deadline to complete its $65-million purchase, of which only $33
million is to be cash. They want $50 million in state funds promised
to Rigas for a since-canceled office complex in downtown Buffalo that
was to have created 1,500 jobs and revitalized the dead city core.
Pataki said last week, however, the state's $10-billion budget
deficit makes fixing HSBC arena a low priority.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello, who was on the City Council when
the Buffalo Braves moved to San Diego -- and became the Clippers --
said he fears history will repeat itself if the Sabres fail.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have a terrible impact on our image," he said. "We want
a team to be a source of pride."</TE>
<TE>   Bettman said last week he couldn't guarantee the club's future
beyond the end of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "If everything comes together, it will be promising," he said. "If
none of this comes together, I can't predict what will happen."</TE>
<TE>   Teen Idols</TE>
<TE>   The world junior championships, which begin Thursday in Sydney and
Halifax, Canada, are a magnet for scouts and general managers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great tournament for us to go see," King General
Manager Dave Taylor said. "It's mostly a [tournament for]
19-year-olds, but we've seen some underage kids play. We get to see
our drafts and other teams' drafts."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings had three of the tournament's top scorers last year,
Mike Cammalleri and Jared Aulin of Canada, and Alexander Frolov of
Russia. This year, they have three draft picks playing for Russia,
defensemen Denis Grebeshkov (first round, 2002) and Mikhail Lyubushin
(seventh round, 2002), and left wing Sergei Anshakov (second round,
2002), and one for Finland, right wing Henrik Juntunen (third round,
2001).</TE>
<TE>   The Mighty Ducks have two draft picks playing for Canada,
center-left wing Joffrey Lupul (first round, 2002) and center Pierre
Parenteau (ninth round, 2001). Igor Pohanka, a 2001 second-round pick
acquired from New Jersey, will play for Slovakia, and Vladimir
Korsunov (fourth round, 2001) will play for Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Canada will be under heavy pressure as the host nation. It hasn't
won since 1997, under current Duck Coach Mike Babcock.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in Canada expects them to come home with the gold,"
said Joe Thornton, a member of that 1997 team. "There's a lot of
media hype about it."</TE>
<TE>   Slap Shots</TE>
<TE>   Hartley's firing was the third in a cluster that began with Greg
Gilbert at Calgary and Darryl Sutter at San Jose. No coach who guided
a team to the Stanley Cup is still with that team.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, with 30 teams in the league and fewer teams,
percentage-wise, making the playoffs, it seems to me we're very
impatient," Duck General Manager Bryan Murray said. "We don't give
our coaches much time.</TE>
<TE>   "The day I heard Bob Hartley had been fired, I thought, 'We're two
points ahead of Colorado and we're having a great year, and they're
having a year not good enough to keep their coach.' "</TE>
<TE>   Paul Maurice, who was appointed coach of the Hartford Whalers on
Nov. 6, 1995, and moved with the club to Carolina, has the longest
tenure among current coaches. Jacques Martin, who took over the
Ottawa Senators on Jan. 24, 1996, is second.</TE>
<TE>   King executives said last week they were still paying deferred
compensation to Wayne Gretzky but a spokesman for Gretzky said he was
no longer receiving checks. The Kings acknowledged that as true.
However, they continue to give him use of a suite at Staples Center
for King games. For other events, though, he must buy his own
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   The Vancouver Canucks are going through their first serious run of
injuries. Goaltender Dan Cloutier has a sore knee. Trevor Linden, who
has an eye problem, and Mattias Ohlund, who has a sprained knee, have
also been out of the lineup.... Will Sergei Samsonov's wrist surgery
spur the Boston Bruins into trading the rights to unsigned defenseman
Kyle McLaren to get help up front?</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Fedorov said he believes the Detroit Red Wings can and will
click into a higher gear as the season goes on.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we can find the switch when we really, really need
it," he said. "We've got guys who have been together for so many
years ... and maybe that's why, when we really need it we go play
extra hard for each other and be a team when we want to be. I think
that's why maybe it's been so much fun playing for this club."</TE>

<KH>ROSE BOWL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Price Gets Mixed Reaction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Mike Price walked to the podium Monday afternoon at the Regent
Beverly Wilshire Hotel during festivities welcoming Washington State
to town for the Jan. 1 Rose Bowl, his players politely applauded from
their chairs in the ballroom.</LD>
<LD>   Then Price introduced the man he calls his "co-coach," Bill Doba,
the team's incoming coach, and Cougar players responded with loud,
enthusiastic applause.</LD>
<LD>   It was a clear sign of the lingering emotions from the tumultuous
two days last week when Price accepted the Alabama coaching job and
Doba was named as his replacement.</LD>
<TE>   "Some people in the media and a few fans feel like I shouldn't be
here, but the team wants me here, the coaching staff wants me here,
and I want them to win," Price said. "They have a chance to be the
winningest team in school history, and I can help."</TE>
<TE>   Price insists he would have quit immediately if he believed his
players didn't want him to coach the New Year's Day game against
Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to take hits for this, but it's the right thing to do,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Price, finishing his 14th season with the Cougars, said he never
sought the Alabama job.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Mike Riley got the job," he said of the New Orleans
Saint assistant who turned down the Alabama job Dec. 13. "I never in
my wildest dreams thought Alabama would offer Mike Price its head
coach job. Not in my wildest dreams."</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Jason Gesser, who initially expressed anger at Price's
decision to leave, said the team has accepted Price's new role as an
outgoing coach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not even an issue anymore," Gesser said. "Nothing has
changed. He's still here. We want him to be here. When we first found
out, you don't know how to react. We had to find out what was going
on."</TE>
<TE>   Price said he has been calling plays throughout his Washington
State coaching career and believes his presence gives the Cougars
their best chance to win.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids deserve my best possible leadership and my best
effort," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The last time Gesser was at the Rose Bowl was on Dec. 7, when he
left the field with a rose between his teeth after leading the
Cougars to a 48-27 victory over UCLA that clinched a berth in the New
Year's Day game.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser was in pain from a severe right ankle sprain but still
played. He said the ankle injury has not healed. "It's 75% to 80%,"
he said. "It's better than the UCLA game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars went through a light workout at the Coliseum on Monday
and will practice today before players are given Christmas off.</TE>

<HD>Texas Tech Rolls Behind Kingsbury</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A monthlong layoff and an ankle injury did little to slow Kliff
Kingsbury.</LD>
<LD>   Kingsbury became the third Division I-A player to top 5,000 yards
passing in a season, throwing for 375 and three touchdowns as Texas
Tech defeated Clemson, 55-15, in the Tangerine Bowl on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   "Five thousand yards, that's a big number," Kingsbury said. "That
shows how well our offense played this season."</LD>
<TE>   Texas Tech (9-5) won its first bowl game since beating Air Force
in the 1995 Copper Bowl and gave Coach Mike Leach his first
postseason victory.</TE>
<TE>   Five receivers caught touchdown passes for the Red Raiders, and
Wes Welker had a 59-yard punt return for a score.</TE>
<TE>   It was the worst loss of the season for Clemson (7-6), and the
worst in a bowl since a 41-0 defeat to Syracuse in the 1996 Gator
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally embarrassed," defensive tackle Nick Eason said. "This
was my last game as a Clemson Tiger, and I got destroyed. I might
have more games, in the NFL, maybe some All-Star games, but this is
one I'll always remember."</TE>
<TE>   Kingsbury completed 32 of 43 passes and finished the season with
5,017 yards. The only other players to reach the mark are Brigham
Young's Ty Detmer, who had 5,188 yards, and Houston's David Klingler,
who had 5,140. Both players did it in 1990. Detmer played in 12
games, Klingler 11.</TE>
<TE>   Clemson freshman quarterback Charlie Whitehurst couldn't match
Kingsbury. He was 20 for 48 for 263 yards with four interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly felt sorry for Whitehurst," Texas Tech defensive end
Aaron Hunt said. "We hit him shot after shot after shot."</TE>

<HD>Some Confusion Over Toledo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>It might qualify as only a minor distraction, but the buzz at
practice Monday centered on the treatment of fired coach Bob Toledo
by Athletic Director Dan Guerrero.</LD>
<LD>   Although players said their coach of seven years was denied a
request to address the team on the day he was fired, Guerrero
indicated he gave Toledo that opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted to coach the [Las Vegas Bowl] and they wouldn't allow me
to coach the game," said Toledo, reached at his home in Westlake
Village. "I told them I wanted to address the entire team and they
felt that politically it wouldn't be good.</LD>
<TE>   "It did kind of bother me. I did want to address them all."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Toledo called players individually.</TE>
<TE>   "A man should be allowed to say his last words to the team,"
senior linebacker Marcus Reese said. "The [athletic director] is
doing a good job making changes, but when a coach recruited us and
has been with us for four years, he should have been able to talk to
us in person."</TE>
<TE>   Through a spokesman, Guerrero said that he told Toledo it would be
awkward for the coach to talk to the team at a scheduled 5:15 p.m.
meeting because the athletic director was going to use the
opportunity to inform the players of the firing.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero told the coach he could address the team the following
day, but Toledo declined.</TE>
<TE>   Before Toledo could clean out his office, his belongings were
tossed into boxes and stacked outside the door. His son-in-law went
to UCLA two days after the firing to clean out the office and
discovered that interim Coach Ed Kezirian had moved in.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo, however, downplayed the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "They said they could box the stuff for me and I think a graduate
assistant did it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo wants to renegotiate the terms of his buyout so he would
not lose a portion of it should he take another coaching position.</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Dupree's Return Expected</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Wrier</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Dupree's return is all but official after the junior forward,
who sat out the Trojans' first seven games while flirting with
academic ineligibility, practiced with the team Monday for the first
time in nearly two months.</LD>
<LD>   Dupree's inclusion means USC expects the high-flying Dupree to be
academically eligible and out of Coach Henry Bibby's doghouse in time
for the Trojans' Pacific 10 Conference opener Jan. 2 at Washington
State.</LD>
<LD>   Dupree said he needed a grade-point average above 2.0 in three
classes. Grades from the fall semester have yet to be posted, but a
source close to the team said Dupree will be declared eligible in a
matter of days.</LD>
<TE>   Dupree, who suffered leg cramps during the two-hour workout,
limped out of the South Gym and into Heritage Hall after the two-hour
workout.</TE>
<TE>   He has acknowledged that he'd have massive catching up to do after
being sidelined because of a sore heel, being denied contact with the
team by Bibby for a week, and dropping a course and falling below
full-time student status, all while serving what amounted to a
semester-long suspension imposed by Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   "There's like 200 new plays," Dupree said recently. "It's a whole
new system."</TE>
<TE>   Dupree, a 6-foot-7, 200-pound forward who can alter a game with
his shot-blocking ability, starred in the Pacific 10 tournament last
spring, and his return to the Trojans (4-3) should improve their
depth.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bibby: "We don't know yet what it is, what the official word
is, but we hope he'll be ready. He participated [in practice] a
little bit, just a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a walking boot to stabilize the sprained right ankle he
suffered during Saturday's blowout victory over La Salle, a
frustrated Robert Hutchinson hobbled around Heritage Hall and did not
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "The trainer said he's not going to speculate on [a timetable for
a return date]," the senior point guard said. "He's just going to
take it day-by-day. Ice it, heat it up and painkillers. That's about
it."</TE>
<TE>   It is the second time in three weeks that Hutchinson has turned
the ankle. This time, though, he feared the worst when a pile of
players chasing a loose ball rolled up his leg.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard it crack so I was thinking it would be a long-term
injury," he said. "All types of things were going through my mind --
pain, everything. I didn't want to get up too fast because I thought
I might hurt it more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, who are in the middle of playing only once in a
21-day stretch, will take today and Christmas Day off. Bibby said he
was planning to fly home to North Carolina for the holiday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC's practice Monday, the last of the season at Howard Jones Field,
turned into a showcase for the four quarterbacks who are challenging
to succeed Heisman Trophy winner Carson Palmer next season.</LD>
<LD>   Redshirt sophomore Matt Cassel, redshirt freshmen Matt Leinart and
Billy Hart and transfer Brandon Hance all moved the offense with
authority as the Trojans went through a mock game before adjourning
for a two-day break.</LD>
<LD>   "Every guy did something that was really good to see," Coach Pete
Carroll said.</LD>
<TE>   Cassel, who has been No. 2 on the depth chart behind Palmer,
guided the Trojans efficiently down the field.</TE>
<TE>   Leinart connected with wide receiver Mike Williams for a gain of
more than 40 yards and also completed a touchdown pass.</TE>
<TE>   Hart made one of the most athletic plays of the day when he rolled
to his left and, without breaking stride, threw back over the middle
for a completion that set up a touchdown pass.</TE>
<TE>   Hance, who is redshirting after transferring from Purdue, also
threw a touchdown pass.</TE>
<TE>   "The quarterback competition is certainly well underway," Carroll
said. "I don't want to leave this thing wide open forever. We've got
to make some decisions, so spring football obviously will be really
important. We'd like to come out of it with the top two guys and
decide who's No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   Hance, who is coming off shoulder surgery, said he was aiming
toward the spring.</TE>
<TE>   "This was good work, but the main thing is to be ready for the
spring," he said. "That's when all of us are going to try and step up
and win the job."</TE>

<TE>   Underclassmen formed a tunnel after practice and seniors traveled
through it on their way out of Howard Jones Field for the final time.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a fun way to end it," said senior safety Troy Polamalu,
a two-time All-American. "There were a lot of good things and a lot
of bad things that happened out there over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be back to visit. You're a Trojan for life."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said the tunnel would become a Trojan tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll always be indebted for all that [the seniors] have done,"
he said. "They've given us a chance to jump-start our program and get
a lot of enthusiasm and excitement back."</TE>

<TE>   Offensive coordinator Norm Chow, one of the leading candidates to
become head coach at Kentucky, said he had spoken again with Kentucky
Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart but did not expect to hear from
Kentucky representatives again until after Christmas.</TE>

<TE>   Freshman linebacker Oscar Lua will report to the hospital this
morning for surgery in the afternoon to repair a torn anterior
cruciate ligament in his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   Family members will spend Christmas Eve in the hospital with Lua,
who is scheduled to return home Christmas Day.</TE>
<TE>   "It bums me out a little bit, but it's the right thing to do," Lua
said.</TE>

<HD>Medellin Ends 45-Year Wait</HD>

<LD>Forty-five years of frustration have ended for Medellin, which on
Sunday won its first Colombian title since 1957 when it tied Pasto,
1-1, in the second game of the two-game final to claim the title,
3-1, on aggregate.</LD>
<LD>   Goalkeeper David Gonzalez, 20, was the key player for Medellin,
making a series of saves to deny Pasto, which was urged on by a
sellout crowd of 25,000 at Estadio Libertad in the southern city of
Pasto.</LD>
<LD>   Mauricio Molina scored directly off a free kick to give Medellin
the advantage after 28 minutes, but Pasto, which has been in the
first division for only four years, fought back and tied the score on
Walter Escobar's goal in the 57th minute.</LD>
<TE>   In a bitterly contested match -- three players were ejected, two
from Medellin -- the home team dominated the second half but was
denied time and again by Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Medellin Coach Victor Luna, who took charge in September with the
team struggling in 13th place, said Monday he had copied the formula
used by Brazil's World Cup-winning coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I did was to give the players back their
self-esteem, just like [Scolari] did with Brazil," he said. It
worked. Under Luna, Medellin lost only two of 20 games in its run to
the championship.</TE>
<TE>   Emelec Wins</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador's league championship race came down to the proverbial
wire, with Emelec staging a dramatic comeback to win the title for
the 10th time and the second year in succession.</TE>
<TE>   The club, based in the port city of Guayaquil, was one point
behind co-leaders Barcelona and El Nacional before Sunday's final
round, during which it defeated Aucas, 2-1, with defender Augusto
Poroso providing the championship-clinching goal.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona was held to a scoreless tie at Liga de Quito and El
Nacional was defeated by Deportivo Quito, 4-1, allowing Emelec to
overtake both clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Colo Colo</TE>
<TE>   Declared bankrupt a year ago and having emerged from beneath the
administration of the court only 10 days ago, Colo Colo nonetheless
found the resources it needed to earn its 23rd Chilean championship.</TE>
<TE>   The Santiago club swept Universidad Catolica in the two-game title
series, winning the first, 2-0, Wednesday and the second, 3-2, Sunday
to win its first championship since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Change</TE>
<TE>   Jack Warner, president of CONCACAF and a FIFA vice president, said
in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, that world soccer's governing body has
decided to abandon its policy of using only referees 45 or younger
for international matches.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate confirmation of the change from FIFA
headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Fulham Setback</TE>
<TE>   Craven Cottage, the stadium alongside the River Thames that has
been the home of English Premier League team Fulham for 106 years,
will not get the face-liftfans had expected after Mohamed Al Fayed,
the London club's chairman, decided the multimillion cost would be
prohibitive.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, to saddle the club with this magnitude of debt in the
current financial climate would be foolhardy in the extreme and could
seriously jeopardize the long-term future of the club," Fulham said
in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Quick Passes</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Thailand, co-host Indonesia, Malaysia and
Vietnam have advanced to the semifinals of the nine-nation Tiger Cup
in Singapore and Jakarta, Indonesia.... Japanese striker Naohiro
Takahara, 23, the J-League's player of the year and the top goal
scorer for league champion Jubilo Iwata, signed a 2 1/2-year contract
to play for Hamburg SV in Germany and will join the Bundesliga club
Jan. 4. Terms were not revealed.... Carlos Bianchi has agreed to
return for three years as coach of Boca Juniors, the Argentine team
he coached with great success between 1998 and 2001.</TE>
