<LD>In her upcoming autobiography, Bo Derek writes that Jane Fonda begged
Derek to date Ted Turner in spring 2000, shortly after Fonda and
Turner had split.</LD>
<LD>   "She told me she loved Ted and just wanted him to be happy ... and
that ... he was a great lover," Derek writes in "Riding Lessons,"
which is due out in February.</LD>
<LD>   Fonda, Derek writes, said her former husband feared rejection from
Derek and asked Fonda to broach the subject of dating on his behalf.
"Jane sounded very happy," Derek writes. "She reiterated to me how
much I would like him, how wonderful and generous Ted was, and, oh,
yes: 'He knows he has to be faithful now.'"</LD>
<TE>   Derek excitedly agreed to go out with the media mogul. "I spent
the next two weeks dying, wondering how I would handle the next part
of this drama," Derek writes. Ultimately, Turner never called.</TE>

<TE>   A Discordant Note</TE>
<TE>   When you want to hit somebody in the head, there's nothing like
one of those big shiny trophies they give away on music awards shows.
Just ask Michael Greene and Dick Clark. Greene is the chief of the
Grammys; Clark is producer of the American Music Awards. They don't
like each other and have been feuding for years.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, as you may know, Clark took the fight up a notch with
a $10-million unfair business practices lawsuit against Greene,
saying the Grammys unfairly blocks big stars from appearing on the
AMA broadcast. (Among the stars who have been caught in the squeeze,
said Clark, is Michael Jackson, with whom he has a long-standing
friendship.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's very personal," said Thomas O'Neil, author of a series of
awards show histories including "The Grammys." "There are fights over
exclusive performances all over show biz--the talk shows do it all
the time--but this is the one everyone is talking about."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neil theorizes that there's something else bothering Clark: His
AMAs "used to clobber the Grammys in ratings, and that's not the case
anymore." In 1997, the AMAs had pulled in about 19.7 million viewers,
compared with about 19.2 million for the Grammys. Last year, Greene's
show pulled in 26.6 million viewers; Clark's broadcast sagged to 16.2
million.</TE>

<TE>   Lowering His Standards</TE>
<TE>   The stand-up comic Cedric the Entertainer is trying on a different
role: author. In his new book, the title of which contains a word we
can't print, Cedric muses about the effect that aging has had on his
libido: "I no longer want incredible, mind-blowing,
forget-all-about-your-past-lovers,
Prince-doesn't-even-do-it-like-this sex. I simply want some sex. Then
I'm back to the playoffs."</TE>

<TE>   New York restaurateur Elaine Kaufman will write a book about her
eponymous restaurant and its celebrity patrons, reports the New York
Daily News. Kaufman has so much to say, in fact, that one volume
can't contain her. She is planning three installments, including a
book of recipes. Yummy.</TE>

<HD>A Box Filled With Sweet Memories</HD>
<DH>As Barnum's Animals Crackers turns 100, Nabisco wants to
add a new beast to the 53 that have inhabited the circus-themed box.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>Animal crackers in my soup,</LD>
<LD>   Monkeys and rabbits loop the</LD>
<LD>   loop ...</LD>
<TE>   Sung by Shirley Temple, 1935</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Little Shirley was wrong. There were never any rabbits. Monkeys,
yes. Lions and tigers and bears, indeed. A jaguar, now and again.
Even a hyena or two.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 100 years, 53 different animals have lived in the
Barnum's Animals Crackers box. We've bitten off their heads, chomped
off their toes and staged circuses on the coffee table -- animal
crackers are, after all, the No. 1 exception to the annoying "Don't
play with your food!" rule.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Morley wrote a poem about them:</TE>
<TE>   Animal crackers, and cocoa to drink,</TE>
<TE>   That is the finest of suppers, I think ...</TE>
<TE>   The Marx Brothers did a movie about them. Sort of. (OK, OK, it was
just the name of the movie. But still.)</TE>
<TE>   So to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the crackers, introduced
in 1902, Nabisco will add another animal to the box. The company has
asked the public to decide among the koala, the walrus, the penguin
and the cobra.</TE>
<TE>   The koala is out front, of course. It's cute. It's cuddly. It even
comes with its own tree.</TE>
<TE>   And, really, who wants to eat a poisonous snake?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, everyone has their favorite animal, and we just wanted to
make sure they were all represented," says Nabisco spokesman Larry
Baumann, trying to explain the cobra inclusion. The penguin, by the
way, is running second, Baumann says, with the walrus firmly
entrenched in third.</TE>
<TE>   The winner will join 17 other animals in the box, including the
lion, the elephant, the bison and two bears--one standing up and one
sitting down.</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry. There doesn't seem to be any bear bias. The Supreme
Court probably won't have to weigh in on this vote. Besides, the
koala isn't really a bear anyway. Remember when life didn't seem so
complicated?</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to get nostalgic. Animal crackers belong to a different
age, an era of comfort and security. Childhood. Memories of a
long-lost time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a connector," says Lawrence Fisher, executive
director of the Barnum Museum in Bridgeport, Conn. Grandparents come
in and start telling kids what they remember, talking about the boxes
they had. There's really something special about them."</TE>
<TE>   But we know now that things have never been as simple as we'd like
to believe.</TE>
<TE>   Is it possible they represent the very beginnings, the first evil
seed, of that now-inescapable world of product tie-ins aimed at our
children? You know: "Monsters, Inc." Happy Meals. Elmo dinnerware.
Poseable Spice Girl dolls. Cheerios storybooks.</TE>
<TE>   Barnum's Animals Crackers.</TE>
<TE>   Yikes!</TE>
<TE>   Take heart. James McNeal, a retired Texas A&amp;M marketing professor
who has researched children's responses to advertising, marketing and
promotions for more than 35 years, says we cannot blame animal
crackers for this.</TE>
<TE>   "If nothing else, the name itself that little kids use is
'animal,' not 'Barnum &amp; Bailey' or 'Ringling Brothers' or any kind of
brand name," he says. "They're just animal crackers. So in that
sense, they pretty well do stand alone."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say McNeal is ready to give them a total pass.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to say that I paused when I heard about the four animals
because, except for the snake, they tend to be a little bit round,
heavy, fat," McNeal explains. "This is something that I'm looking at
rather seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Seriously?</TE>
<TE>   "Well," McNeal continues, "when we talk about children and healthy
lifestyles, there's a tendency to talk about unhealthy food--french
fries, whatever--but my concern is with cartoon characters, and
animal characters, who send out the message that fat is fun."</TE>
<TE>   Think about it. Barney is fat. Teletubbies are tubby. Porky the
Pig is--well, isn't it obvious?</TE>
<TE>   Nabisco's Baumann says the main reason most of the animals are
round, or chubby, is packaging, so they don't break in transit.
Alligators, for example, failed to make the cut for the contest
because the product development team decided their tails would be too
fragile.</TE>
<TE>   Barnum's Animals, by the way, have 260 calories per small box and
these days are considered a "low fat" snack food, with 8 grams of
fat.</TE>
<TE>   P.T. Barnum, the greatest self-promoter in history, had nothing to
do with the box that bears his name. And never got a cent for it.
That's according to our man Fisher of the Barnum Museum. Ringling
Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus still doesn't get a cut, or a
licensing fee.</TE>
<TE>   This is what happened: In 1889, Barnum decided to do something
truly nutty, a tour of England with his circus. So after his buddy
Bailey figured out how, exactly, you get a circus onto a boat and
across an ocean, Barnum's animals made their European debut.</TE>
<TE>   The English, meanwhile, had already invented animal biscuits.
Sensing a marketing moment, several companies started manufacturing
animal biscuits with circus packaging and called them Barnum's.</TE>
<TE>   Soon the product migrated across the ocean, where Nabisco's
forerunner, the National Biscuit Co., put them on U.S. store shelves
in 1902. Originally called Barnum's Animals, they became Barnum's
Animals Crackers in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   There are many varieties of animal crackers/cookies available
today. But they don't have the box.</TE>
<TE>   The box, we love the box. The circus cages, the brightly painted
animals, the old door you could pop out to make it a real "cage."</TE>
<TE>   Looking for a special Christmas promotion, National Biscuit
executives came up with the idea of specially designed red and green
boxes with a circus theme. Thinking the boxes would make fine
Christmas tree ornaments, they added the little string, to make it
easier to hang boxes on branches. So, alas, you were wrong. That
little string was not there so we could carry the box around like a
purse.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that's what people (OK, girls ) did with it anyway.
Marbles, pennies, costume jewelry, rocks--all have been stuffed in a
Barnum box at some point.</TE>
<TE>   To find someone who hangs the boxes on the tree, we had to go to
Dallas, where graphic artist Linda Sue Lammers uses them on the
circus-themed Christmas tree she puts up every year in her
circus-themed den.</TE>
<TE>   "They just look so cute with all my other circus things," says
Lammers. "I've got a popcorn garland and circus animals and a cotton
candy thing my friend made for me."</TE>
<TE>   For the record, though, she always thought the string was a purse
thing, too.</TE>
<TE>   An informal survey of animal-cracker eaters seems to indicate that
a preponderance of us bite the heads off first.</TE>
<TE>   What this means, we do not know. It does, however, seem to suggest
a certain sense of--shall we say aggression?--toward animal species.
So what does People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals have to say
about all this?</TE>
<TE>   PETA is clearly anti-circus, given that it has created an entire
Web site (www.circuses.com) to detail circus-related sins. Its press
office was happy to provide an official statement of its position on
this subject, which reads:</TE>
<TE>   "We are glad that the cookies are vegan but sad that they promote
circus animal misery--if only they'd make whip, chain and bull-hook
cookies to show kids the full story."</TE>
<TE>   So much for nostalgia.</TE>

children have become interested in owning an owl as a pet. Like
Hedwig, the snowy owl in the Harry Potter books, owls may appear
friendly and fun to own. But Los Angeles Zoo bird experts warn
against it.</LD>
<LD>   Owls do not make good pets for many reasons. First, it is illegal
to own owls. Places like the L.A. Zoo have permits to keep owls for
educational purposes. Second, owls are not social animals like dogs
and cats, and would not like living in your home. You also would not
be happy owning an owl because they are nocturnal animals. These
birds stay up at night and rest during the day--a schedule that would
be very difficult to deal with. They would be up at night hooting
while you're trying to sleep.</LD>
<LD>   Experts also discourage owls as pets because they are very
powerful animals and could seriously hurt people (even adults) if
bothered. They can cause serious injury with their strong talons, or
claws. The zoo's animal keepers who handle owls have to wear thick
leather gloves to protect themselves.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, owls are difficult to own because they need to eat whole
mice and rats, animals that people cannot easily find.</TE>
<TE>   Although they do not make good pets, owls are very important to
the environment. Because they eat mice and rats, owls help control
the rodent population. Owls common to the Los Angeles area are the
great-horned owl and barn owl.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Zoo has two spectacled owls on exhibit. These owls
are native to South America. You can learn more about owls and 1,200
other animals by visiting the zoo or its Web site at www.lazoo.org.
For general zoo information, call (323) 644-6400.</TE>

<LD>"Eyes on Nature: Penguins"</LD>
<LD>   by Jane P. Resnick</LD>
<LD>   Penguins are a type of bird but they cannot fly. They appear to be
flying under water when they are really swimming. Penguins can be
found below the equator where it is very cold.</LD>
<TE>   There are 17 different species of penguins. Some look very fancy
like the Macaroni penguins. And some look plainer. My favorite is the
Chinstrap penguin because of the black stripe across its chin.</TE>
<TE>   Penguins always have fish, krill and squid on their menu. They
like living in big groups called rookeries. They communicate by voice
and body language. Each penguin has its own voice and sound. They can
always find each other by their sound.</TE>
<TE>   I think that if someone wanted to learn about penguins, this would
be a very good book to read.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Graceless, stylistically impaired authors often achieve success by
laying on flashy locales, gaudy characters and concepts so high
they'd have posed a problem for Sir Edmund Hillary. The real pros,
such as Thomas Perry, don't need the fancy stuff. "Pursuit" (Random
House, 374 pages, $24.95), Perry's 12th novel, is based on one of
crime fiction's most familiar concepts--the hunter and the hunted. In
this case, the latter is the bad guy, an extremely capable hit man
named Varney.</LD>
<LD>   The book opens on a compelling if merciless description of one of
his signature jobs, the slaughter of 13 diners and employees--men,
women and children--at a small Louisville restaurant. A criminology
professor named Millikan is our guide through the carnage, pointing
out the murderer's expertise and ruthlessness; he killed everyone to
hide the identity of a specific victim.</LD>
<LD>   Concerned that the police may be no match for the amazingly
efficient assassin, Millikan suggests to a grieving father that he
hire Roy Prescott, a specialist in tracking and thinning the world's
predator population.</LD>
<TE>   Prescott is, in fact, the antithesis of the author's most famous
creation--Jane Whitefield, the Native American "guide" whose
specialty is hiding potential victims. Once Prescott takes the job,
the novel shifts into a gear so high that putting the book aside is
no longer an option. Twists, turns, mind games, traps, escapes and
violent encounters, all convincingly detailed and precisely timed,
are just some of the lures the ever-inventive Perry strings out,
building to the inevitable final shootout. It's a bravura performance
from one of the few crime writers who never lets you down.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to believe that a mystery series about a
multimillionaire sleuth and his psychic Siamese tabbies could
challenge the popularity of such bestselling purveyors of
semi-realistic sleuthing as Robert B. Parker, Jonathan Kellerman and
Patricia Cornwell, but that's what Lilian Jackson Braun's "The Cat
Who ... " books do on an annual basis. What's her secret? Not the
mystery element, which is adequate at best, nor the cast of
characters, credible but typical rural types in the main. Nor is it
those darn cats, which are, truth be known, a bit too darn cute.</TE>
<TE>   Braun's strong suit is her storytelling voice, which is filled
with enough sense of wonder and whimsy to turn her yarns into ideal
bedtime tales for grown-ups. In tone they are sophisticated updates
on the Uncle Wiggly stories with the dilettantish James "Qwill"
Qwilleran standing in for the fuzzy-eared gentleman rabbit. She's
also created an irresistible location--the little town of Pickax in
Moose County, described as being "400 miles north of
everywhere"--that is cozy and comfortable, even with its alarming
crime rate.</TE>
<TE>   Such is the lure of the burg that one doesn't question for a
minute why the filthy rich Qwilleran would pack up his checkbook and
cats and move there, rather than L.A. or New York or Paris or Rome,
for that matter. In her 24th novel in the series, "The Cat Who Went
Up the Creek" (Putnam, 226 pages, $23.95), Qwill and his precocious
pets take a trip to nearby Black Creek to see if an inn owned by
friends is really haunted. They wind up investigating the murder of a
gold nugget-bearing former guest.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, there are subplots beaucoup, covering such topics as
Qwill's book-in-progress, "Tall and Short Tales," and a local
production of "The Pirates of Penzance," all making this year's trip
to Moose County as enjoyable as the past 23.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Sallie Bissell made her mystery writing debut with "In
the Forest of Harm," a powerful first novel featuring Mary Crow, a
half-Cherokee assistant district attorney in Atlanta, whose camping
trip with two women friends in the North Carolina mountains turns
into a nightmarish, distaff "Deliverance." The new Crow outing, "A
Darker Justice" (Bantam, 352 pages, $22.95), gets her into the
Carolina wilderness again, this time on the trail of her kidnapped
mentor, a federal judge who made the hit list of FaithAmerica, an
ultraconservative group slightly to the right of the Ku Klux Klan.</TE>
<TE>   Mary is helped here by a no-nonsense FBI agent named Daniel Safer.
She's pretty no-nonsense herself, though the book's
premise--involving the assassination of left-leaning federal judges
by a spectacularly unusual group of killers--seemed to me, even in
these days of unthinkable acts, a trifle de trop.</TE>

<LD>Hostilities erupted between Manhattan co-op dwellers Leigh and Gene
Edelstein and their next-door neighbors in 1995--the year their
Maltese pooch, Bogey, arrived on the scene. There's been no letup
since.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, an arf or two from Bogey is enough to send the
neighbors--who share a common wall with the Edelsteins--into combat
mode.</LD>
<LD>   "One time my neighbor came out with a baseball bat," says Gene,
adding, "She was in a backswing position like Scott Brosius. But her
husband came out and grabbed her kicking and screaming back into the
apartment." Unfortunately, the rift doesn't end with Bogey.</LD>
<TE>   Recently, there was a moment of panic when the Edelsteins' cat,
Tigressa, followed Leigh into the hallway, then disappeared into the
apartment of their neighbors, who left their door ajar.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sure she was going to cook Tigressa for dinner at the
minimum," says Gene. "My neighbor mouthed a string of obscenities,
then threw the cat into the hallway back at Leigh. That was lucky. I
thought we'd never see Tigressa again."</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to keep the peace, the Edelsteins recently bought a
special anti-bark dog collar that releases a citronella spray that
dogs don't like when Bogey gets a bit noisy.</TE>
<TE>   Says Gene, "We try not to use it often because we may 'de-dogize'
the dog." But when all is said and done, he observes, "The neighbor
barks more than the dog."</TE>
<TE>   Always awkward and often ugly, discord between neighbors is not
that unusual, according to Norwalk, Conn., attorney Sheri Paige.
What's more, sometimes the solution is as nettlesome as the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Neighbor against neighbor is a frequent case [in my office] and
sometimes homeowner against homeowner," says Paige, who claims that
homeowners are usually more civilized and "don't come to blows"
while, in her experience, renters "seem to be a little more
supercharged."</TE>
<TE>   For example, Paige is currently handling the case of a landlord
who rented a two-bedroom apartment in his home to a couple who
subsequently moved in 13 relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 15 people who are very happy, but my clients are
miserable," she says, commenting that every time they turn around,
something else happens.</TE>
<TE>   No sooner had her clients bought a backyard swing set for their
child, then one of the renters' relatives started hanging underwear
and bras all over it.</TE>
<TE>   It's being used "as a giant clothesline," Paige says.</TE>
<TE>   The solution? After the police were called to the scene four
times, the tenant promised to clear out his relatives, she says. If
he doesn't keep his promise, the situation will be referred to
housing court, and they'll be evicted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not easy to evict somebody," Paige says. "You give them time
to find an apartment, probably three or four months," and in the
process, she adds, the landlord has to spend a lot of money in legal
fees.</TE>
<TE>   Take it a step further, and if one of the parties breaks the law,
an arrest can follow. "[The defendant] generally has to pay a
criminal defense lawyer because [he's] been arrested and has to come
to court and clear the charges," she says.</TE>
<TE>   According to Paige, the attorney will try to get the involved
parties to deal with each other, while social workers in the criminal
court system attempt to get the individuals to mediate.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time they are very successful," she says. "But if no
one forgives and forgets, it becomes difficult. A lot of people pay
us to deal with this kind of stuff to keep their records clean."</TE>
<TE>   As to why such problems flare up in the first place, Stamford,
Conn., psychologist Steven Spitz says people regard home, property,
family and pets as "personal territory" and an extension of
themselves. "When those things are threatened by something a neighbor
might do, it gets taken in a very personal way, and people sometimes
have these very strong responses. They feel threatened, which could
lead to an escalation of the problem."</TE>

<LD>"Fragile, handle with care," the box said.</LD>
<LD>   "Mom!" Izzy hollered.</LD>
<LD>   She tore through the house, her dog, Lance, close behind.</LD>
<TE>   "Mom! Where are you?" she hollered again.</TE>
<TE>   "Out back," her mother called from the garden. "What's all the
fuss?" Her mother slapped puffs of dirt from her hands.</TE>
<TE>   Izzy struggled to undo the sealed package before giving up and
handing it to her mother.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's it from?" asked her mother, slicing through the sturdy
tape.</TE>
<TE>   A capital "G" caught Izzy's eye.</TE>
<TE>   "It's from Grammy!" she squealed with delight. "Careful," Izzy
said, pointing to the "fragile, handle with care" marking while Lance
pawed at her mom's freshly planted pansies.</TE>
<TE>   "Lance!" she scolded the pup, handing the opened package back. "I
just planted those not 10 minutes ago!"</TE>
<TE>   Izzy slipped her hand through the flaps and reached inside the
box.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, don't keep me in suspense," her mother quipped, shooing the
dog away from her flower bed.</TE>
<TE>   Izzy unwound the layers of bubble wrap.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wooden box," she gasped, skimming her fingertips across
its bumpy porcelain lid.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Izzy," her mother said. "It's Grammy's music box, a very
special family heirloom."</TE>
<TE>   Izzy could tell the box was very special, but she didn't know what
an heirloom was.</TE>
<TE>   "A family treasure," her mom explained.</TE>
<TE>   Izzy carefully turned its tiny brass key, and the pretty box
plinked a sweet melody.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly Lance bolted through the air, knocking the box from
Izzy's grip. She fumbled to catch it, but the music box landed with a
thud.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As of Tuesday, readers of the New York Times opened their papers to
find an absence. The special "A Nation Challenged" section, which the
Times quickly established as a daily chronicle of war, mourning and
restoration, has gone out with the old.</LD>
<LD>   These issues, which stood alone in the newspaper for the past few
months, "have become woven into all aspects of national and
international life," said Monday's editor's note, which announced the
special section's cessation on its front page. "The new year provides
an occasion to reflect that evolution by incorporating the coverage
into the paper's main sections."</LD>
<LD>   The section was launched one week after terrorists struck the
World Trade Center just a few miles south of the Times' 43rd Street
headquarters. But as grief recedes for those readers only indirectly
affected by the tragedy, as New York is restored to peacetime
conditions, and as the economy continues its sluggish slump, the
advertising-free section bids the city adieu. Some editors cite
reader fatigue of the unrelenting coverage, and others cite editor
fatigue after three months of unyielding work in the newsroom, in the
streets of New York and abroad in Europe and the Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   It has been the only daily special section in an American
newspaper devoted to coverage of the terror attacks' aftermath,
weaving together local and international reporting, which are usually
presented in separate sections. For many New Yorkers, the section has
been synonymous with crisis coverage, and its cessation will probably
be considered a symbol of the city's shift into more peaceful times.</TE>
<TE>   The section has won accolades from even typically contrarian
figures like  Rupert Murdoch--owner of the  New York Post--who
admitted on the Charlie Rose show that the Times' staffers "have just
pulled on all their huge resources and done a fantastically good
job."</TE>
<TE>   "I think that years from now it will be seen as a kind of stunning
high point for the Times, and perhaps even for American journalism,"
says media critic Jay Rosen, who will be sorry to see it end. Rosen,
chair of the media department at New York University, says a good
deal of the section's effectiveness lies in the blend of local
stories with the larger international scope. "Having all these
articles on a big, complicated story in one place invites the reader
to draw connections. Reading it is a kind of act of
coherence-making--news is usually so fragmented."</TE>
<TE>   But media critic Danny Schechter, executive editor of
Mediachannel.org, has found the grouping of related stories in one
section problematic. "I think it's a sort of ghettoizing of the
coverage, so if you're not interested in it, you're just not going to
look at it. You're not going to happen upon it elsewhere in the
paper." Schechter says his acquaintances at the Times have also been
critical of the section, referring to it as the "landfill" section.
"They've got a point," he says. "It's certainly a landfill of
information."</TE>
<TE>   The section has not only functioned as a forum for national and
international reporting and analysis, but has also been a reservoir
of focused personal mourning. The section has been a home to more
than 1,800 obituaries of people lost in the attacks in special
feature titled "Portraits of Grief." As new names and stories emerge
about those killed Sept. 11, the Times expects to run additional
tribute pages. And the portraits published in 2001 will find a
permanent home in a hardcover book to be published this spring. The
book's profits will be donated to a Times charitable fund.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the end of this section can be seen as difficult
task of line-drawing in a complicated time. Perhaps it's an
affirmation of sorts that top editors feel its time to return the
paper to its previous format for the new year. Or maybe it's evidence
of one crisis outweighing another one: Perhaps the expense of
providing special coverage in especially bad economic times has just
become too tough to bear.</TE>
<TE>   "A Nation Challenged" will continue as a heading in the paper's
front section, lest anyone consider the challenge abated. And the
Times has publicly reserved the right to resurrect the section in the
event, as the editor's note put it, of "another overwhelming news
development, transcending all boundaries." With terms such as these,
let's hope this farewell is as irreversible as the one we've just bid
to a challenged year.</TE>

<HD>A Strong Second Act</HD>
<DH>At a Downey rehabilitation center, patients recovering from
trauma find new confidence in performing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUANE NORIYUKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The beginning can be traced to the tears of Amaana Thompson. It was
June, and Thompson, who had taken the bus from Inglewood, arrived
early one morning for treatment at Rancho Los Amigos National
Rehabilitation Center in Downey.</LD>
<LD>   Linda Muccitelli saw her crying in the lobby and tried to comfort
her, but Thompson, 63, said she felt buried beneath a painful past
and an uncertain future. Muccitelli, an occupational therapist at the
center, listened, then suggested Thompson write about her feelings.</LD>
<LD>   "Who am I?" she wrote. "Where am I and when?" It was a poem about
searching for one's place in the world, and finding it in a memory.
Muccitelli, 37, understood. She, too, had felt adrift at times in her
life. She read Thompson's poem and hung it on her office wall.</LD>
<TE>   The poem sparked a connection between the two women that grew
until it turned into a remarkable evening of theater, transforming
not just for Thompson, but for dozens of others whose lives have been
shattered by bullets, by car crashes, by illness.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson had come to the center for help after injuring her
shoulder in a fall, the latest trauma in a series that included brain
surgery and stroke. And Muccitelli was in her 12th year of helping
people rebuild physically and emotionally when she was assigned to be
Thompson's occupational therapist. As the women talked, they
discovered a shared passion for theater--Muccitelli is a graduate of
the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena; Thompson had acted
in 36 productions of the Performing Arts Society of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The words, as they sometimes do with Muccitelli, tumbled
innocently out of her mouth: "We should put on a show," she said, and
then she smiled.</TE>
<TE>   Words kept tumbling. She started talking about how she could
gather some of her patients, set up a few folding chairs in the
courtyard and do a little show. She mentioned it to her acting
teacher, Loree Lynn, founder of DreaMakers Center for the Aspiring
Artist in Manhattan Beach. Lynn, diagnosed with polio at age 10, said
she once conducted a performing arts program at a rehabilitation
facility in Chicago. She offered to help coach performers.</TE>
<TE>   Word went out, and half a dozen people showed up for the first
meeting. Rehearsals began in September, and each week the cast seemed
to grow, as did Muccitelli's vision. She saw the show as the first
step toward a permanent performing arts program at Rancho. Maybe they
could take their show on the road? Or have their own theater, or
develop a television show set in a rehab center?</TE>
<TE>   Possibilities seemed endless, the way they should seem, Muccitelli
realized, to an occupational therapist.</TE>
<TE>   She donated her time on evenings and weekends. When participants
had no way of getting to rehearsals, she gave them rides.</TE>
<TE>   As the December show date neared, 18 participants, some of them
performing for the first time, prepared to take the stage, except
that there was no stage. The show was held in a large conference room
at the center. Chairs were set up and room left open for wheelchairs.
Makeshift partitions were installed along one side of the room to
provide a backstage area. Muccitelli brought drapes from home to set
up a changing area.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout preparations, she saw lives changing. When she learned
that Carmen Pelayo, a singer, had not worn a dress since injuries in
a car crash confined her to a wheelchair seven years ago, Muccitelli
brought her a skirt and encouraged her to give it a try.</TE>
<TE>   Like others, Pelayo, 27, was quiet and shy at first but gained
confidence over time.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately the program was not about glamour or stardom or a TV
series. It was about occupational therapy. It was about healing and
hope, and the courage they sometimes entail. It was about making a
statement that life is about what people can do, not what they can't.</TE>
<TE>   Invitations for the show were sent out and almost 200 people
confirmed. The performers were getting nervous. They would need more
than a few folding chairs.</TE>
<TE>   On the night of the show, the room is packed. Performers enter
single file for their opening act, a skit in which Muccitelli plays
an occupational therapist counseling her patients. It is to be
followed by a series of individual performances.</TE>
<TE>   Most cast members are in wheelchairs, and they are led by Autianya
Pascqua. You may have seen her dancing on stage with LL Cool J or NWA
before she crashed on the Hollywood Freeway one Sunday after church
in 1992. You may have seen her host a cable hip-hop show in Compton.
Or you may have seen her rolling down some alley at 4 in the morning
a few years ago in search of crack cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   The paths leading to Rancho Los Amigos emerge from darkness or
voids as bodies and souls tragically broken come to heal, take
inventory and gather what has been lost or stolen. Rancho averages
more than 3,000 inpatient admissions and 54,000 outpatient visits a
year. For the past nine years, it has been recognized as one of the
top rehabilitation facilities in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Each patient has a story to tell. Alma Valentine's is about
getting caught in cross-fire three years ago, about a stray bullet
that pierced her right lung and exploded into her spinal cord as she
was leaving a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Seated in the third row are her parents, David and Leonor Avila of
Las Vegas. They have come to see Valentine, 40, perform. She used to
sing at Cinco de Mayo and other events but has not sung publicly
since being injured.</TE>
<TE>   Pieces of her life seemed to shatter like precious china that
night. During the past three years she has overcome great anger and
sadness. She has had to reach out from her wheelchair and pick up
slivers of her life, one by one. "This," she says before her
performance, "is the final piece."</TE>
<TE>   Much of her life is back in order, even though it seemed at times
she might sink only deeper and deeper into isolation. Members of her
family thought she was gone forever. Tonight, she says, she will show
her children she is still "Mama." And she will show her parents that
again she is whole and that she might soon share a song with her
father.</TE>
<TE>   Blanca Alvarado, 30, has been awake since 4 a.m. for dialysis.
Diagnosed in 1994 with lupus, she needs surgery but she has told her
doctor it would have to wait until after the performance. "This is so
important," she says. "I may never have another opportunity to do
this." Her mother moved from Mexico and lives with her and cares for
her. A couple of times a week, they clean houses to earn money. When
Alvarado talks about her life, she often says, "I used to be an
actress," having performed on American and Mexican stages.</TE>
<TE>   During one rehearsal, Lynn, the acting coach, had her wheel up to
each member of the cast and shout, "I am an actress, I am an
actress." Part of healing, she has been told, is understanding that
she is still the person she used to be. "Life is still there," she
says, "and you need to find your way."  As the cast leaves the stage
after the opening skit, she is energized, glowing. She is an actress.</TE>
<TE>   The first performer is Treanna Turner, 23, who has written a poem,
"The Spirit of Love," the title of the show. Turner glides
confidently back and forth, swaying from side to side across the
front of the room in her wheelchair. "I love my life," she begins,
then repeats the line, a bit louder each time: "I love my life. I
love my life. I had to fight for my life, fight to breathe, fight to
survive, fight to stay alive...."</TE>
<TE>   The mother of two was injured by gunfire in 1999. Her mother sits
in the front row.</TE>
<TE>   Turner's voice is strong. Throughout her monologue, she moves,
staring straight into the eyes, into the hearts, of audience members,
punctuating words by casting a fist into the air. "Can we put down
the guns and stop the killin'? Let's give our kids a better chance of
livin'." The audience stands, those who can, and applauds as she
leaves the room.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, the performers come before the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Dodge, 61, plays the cello. She has performed with the
Beverly Hills Symphony, Santa Monica Opera Co. and others. She has
appeared at the Hollywood Bowl, Shrine Auditorium, and once at the
Greek Theatre, she played with Jack Benny.</TE>
<TE>   In the past seven years she has had eight surgeries, the result of
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. She started playing again in
September. Practicing up to three hours a day, she is back with the
New Valley Symphony Orchestra. Her message is one of thanks, she
says, to doctors and therapists and, particularly, to one member of
the audience, her daughter, Britton Dodge, 29, who has nursed her
through recovery. "People had written her off," her daughter says,
"and it's hard to come back when that happens."</TE>
<TE>   Amaana Thompson, whose poem written in the Rancho lobby last
summer inspired the event, walks slowly in darkness from the back of
the room, singing "Sometimes I feel like a motherless child." As she
reaches the front, she turns suddenly and drops her cane. "Where am
I? Who am I, and when?"</TE>
<TE>   As a child, Thompson often hid in the basement or attic of her
East Los Angeles home, hoping that if she remained out of sight long
enough--like dreams or darkness--she might simply fade away. There
is, however, one warm memory. She is 5 years old, shelling peas on
the veranda at her grandmother's. She's wearing a plaid dress and
ruffled pinafore her mother made for her. For that one moment, her
monologue goes, she knew exactly who she was.</TE>
<TE>   As she ends her performance, there is loud applause. Thompson is
not used to it and, in some ways, does not expect it. ("You applaud
someone if they're putting on a show," she had said the day before
her performance, "but you don't applaud somebody if they're giving
their heart to you.")</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Pelayo, the shy one, sings "There Will Come a Day." The
wheelchair seems to disappear, leaving only her voice. Her two
children are in the audience. They listen and watch their mother. She
is wearing a skirt.</TE>
<TE>   A trumpet sounds to introduce Alma Valentine. She wheels herself
out, followed by a six-piece mariachi band. A man in the third row
immediately stands alone and stares as if in disbelief. It is
Valentine's father.</TE>
<TE>   His eyes follow her to the center of the room, and he blows her a
kiss. She begins to sing, and he remains standing. Then, slowly, he
sits back down, places his head in his hands and sobs.</TE>
<TE>   He taught her to sing when she was a child, and often they sang
together. Once after she was injured, they tried to sing again, but
Valentine's voice was gone. Her abdominal muscles were too weak to
support her voice or even a sneeze or cough. It was one more thing
she could not do.</TE>
<TE>   Her son, David Castillo, 19, a political science major at San Jose
State, is working the video camera. He helped her after she was shot,
as roles seemed reversed: mother became child, dependent on her three
children to help her with everyday needs.</TE>
<TE>   At first, anger stood in the way. When she went to occupational
therapy at another hospital, she was told, "We're going to teach you
to cook." Valentine's response was quiet and cold. "I know how to
cook," she said, "so how will you teach me?"</TE>
<TE>   She later enrolled in therapy at Rancho, where she began to piece
together her life and regain control over her body. Divorced, she
fell in love again. She returned to college, studying to become a
history teacher. As she takes her bow, her father stands again,
blowing more kisses, applauding, seeing through tears.</TE>
<TE>   The final number belongs to Pascqua, dressed in white, wearing
wings of an angel. She enters in a cloud of fog, sings, glides and
dances in her wheelchair. Pascqua, 32, has danced and sung from the
time she was a child growing up in Torrance. A lot went wrong in her
life, many things that could have taken her down: the beatings, the
crash, the drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm still here," she says, "so I guess that means I have a
job to do." The name of her piece is "Enjoy Life While You Can."</TE>
<TE>   As the cast returns for the closing song, a little girl in a pink
dress walks from the front row of the audience to Pascqua and crawls
into her lap. Her name is Paige Looney. She is 6 years old and was
born without knees and ankles. She dreams of wearing white sneakers
some day and becoming a doctor. In 1997, she suffered a stroke and
has endured five heart surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   Muccitelli saw her at the center one day and invited her to the
show. Like others on stage and in the audience, she will face more
obstacles in life--some of them huge--but tonight she finds herself
in the lap of an angel. And in the arms of a song.</TE>

<HD>No Playful Chads to Lighten Up the Year</HD>
<DH>2001's list of top terms will probably be more on the
serious side, such as 'ground zero' and 'anthrax.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their previous top words list has Sept. 10 written all over it. Most
Outrageous was "wall thumping," for rubbing your thigh against a
security scanner so you don't have to pull an entry card from a
pocket. Runner up for Most Euphemistic was "Supreme Court justice," a
slap at the tangled process of deciding the 2000 U.S. presidential
election. And, for Word of the Year, there was "chad," along with,
presumably, its comic couplings with "swinging," "dimpled" and
"pregnant."</LD>
<LD>   Each January since 1990, linguists and other academics of the
American Dialect Society have voted on the words or phrases that rock
their world, which otherwise is devoted to the study of "Devoiced
Obstruents in Pennsylvania Dutchified English" and other such
matters.</LD>
<LD>   The choices, in about seven categories, typically reflect a
celebration of the English language, its capacity for reinvention,
innovation, playfulness. This year, though, the list of winners is
expect to characterize a year in which Americans struggled for words
that weren't there, in which our expanded lexicon denoted an
unfamiliar fear with terms such as "homeland security," "suspicious
mail" and "new normalcy."</LD>
<TE>   The society will vote for the top words of 2001 on Friday, at its
annual meeting in San Francisco. Nominated words and phrases are not
necessarily new ones but those that were used last year in a
prominent or distinctive way.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Glowka, chair of the society's new-words committee, is one
of two or three members who traditionally submit nominating lists in
advance, though anyone at the group's meeting can throw out
suggestions. The top word or phrase for 2001 will be related to the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, predicted Glowka, an English professor at
Georgia College and State University. "The Word of the Year is who we
are and what we are in any given year....It comes down to a feeling."
Previous Word of the Year winners tend to trigger a defining memory
of the times: "Y2K" in 1999; the prefix "e-" in 1998, as in
e-commerce; and "millennium bug" in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   For 2001, Glowka's choice is "Let's roll," the phrase used by Todd
Beamer before he and other passengers rushed hijackers on the United
Airlines flight that crashed in Pennsylvania. Beamer's words were a
"heroic reaction to an absolutely horrible day," Glowka said, noting
that the expression was picked up by President Bush and used as a
rallying cry. "When I first heard it, I was stirred."</TE>
<TE>   Among Glowka's other nominations are words that underscore the way
in which the country still has not settled on a term for the day of
the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon: "9/11," "911,"
"Sept. 11" and "Terrible Tuesday." Glowka also is proposing the
phrase "Sept. 10" as a time in which the U.S. was "oblivious to
impending danger."</TE>
<TE>   In the group's online discussions, other members have been kicking
around possibilities such as "anthrax," "sleeper cell" and "The
terrorists will have won," as in: "If we don't go about our daily
business, the terrorists will have won."</TE>
<TE>   Another noted list, yourDictionary.com's Top 10 Words of 2001,
ranks "ground zero" as No. 1. "We're trying to reflect what's
happening in the language and what's happening in the culture," said
Paul J.J. Payack, president and chief executive of the Web portal,
which offers more than 1,800 dictionaries online. The site's
linguistic experts track the evolution of and innovations in word
choice and usage; last year, for instance, it cited "ground zero" on
its list of top cliches for its misuse in phrases such as "starting
over from ground zero," rather than its original definition as the
point at which a nuclear bomb explodes. Now, of course, the words
refer to the former site of the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Language is a living instrument," said Payack, who is based in
Danville, Calif. "It's malleable. It's changeable. When something
like Sept. 11 happens, we all have the same vocabulary. That's very
unusual. If I said the word 'heroes' to you six months ago, you
wouldn't say ... 'guys on an airplane.'"</TE>
<TE>   Other Top 10 Words include "God," which is listed with Allah and
Yahweh, for being "in more headlines and on the lips of more
politicians than any time in recent memory," and "W," in reference to
George W. Bush, "the butt of January's political jokes [who] waxes
most presidential in September."</TE>
<TE>   Even yourDictionary.com's list of top colors is an indicator of
societal shifts, Payack said. Last year's choices included
"periwinkle," "salmon" and "anything 'pearlized,'" or textured. This
year: "red," "white," "blue," along with "burka blue," referring to
the color of full-body coverings that the Taliban forced women to
wear in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The sobering times notwithstanding, linguists still are tracking
the lighter side of the language. Geoffrey Nunberg, a Stanford
University linguist, recently heard the phrase "weapons-grade salsa,"
a spinoff of the term used by officials to refer to a highly
concentrated form of anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   YourDictionary.com's lists don't yet reflect playful words that
derive from the flat terms of terrorism, Payack said. By comparison,
last year's selections were a cinch. "'Chad'--people loved it. There
were a million stories on it, and it was kind of fun. This [year]
isn't so much fun."</TE>

<LD>Proponents of campaign finance reform are within a whisker of pulling
off a great parliamentary achievement, if only three more members of
Congress will shed their faintheartedness and help force a vote on
the measure. Two California Republicans, Reps. Elton Gallegly of Simi
Valley and Doug Ose of Sacramento, might be persuaded if they hear
from enough constituents and other Californians over this holiday
recess.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign reform bill sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays
(R-Conn.) and Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.) would breeze through the
House of Representatives if House leaders would only allow it to come
up for a vote. Instead, in a failure of political leadership and
courage, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and his lieutenants have
bottled up the measure in committee.</LD>
<LD>   To drag the bill out of committee by petition requires the
signatures of a majority of House members, 218. When the House
recessed Dec. 21 for the year, the pro-reform forces had crept up to
214 signatures. One other member has promised to sign, so the forces
of good need only three more signatures.</LD>
<TE>   The leadership has threatened Republican members with punishment
if they sign the petition. The threat appears to be working. Only one
of the 20 Republicans in the California delegation has signed the
petition--Stephen Horn of Long Beach, who is not seeking reelection
because his seat was dissolved by reapportionment. All 32 California
Democrats have signed.</TE>
<TE>   Shays' office notes that Gallegly and Ose are co-sponsors of the
reform bill but have not signed the petition. Petition opponents
usually claim that they are not against reform but oppose the
discharge movement because it undermines the committee process in the
House. This is a fine argument for a university seminar but it won't
fly in this battle of power politics. Either you are for reform or
you're not. And if you are for reform, it appears the only way it can
be achieved is to defy the GOP leadership and pull the bill out of
committee.</TE>
<TE>   The Shays-Meehan measure generally would ban the use of "soft
money" in election campaigns. These are the unlimited contributions
that can be made to parties, technically for voter registration,
get-out-the-vote drives and voter education programs. In fact,
because of a loophole in the existing law the money is used to
blanket races with the kind of attack ads that make "politics" a bad
word. The Senate has passed a similar bill, and only House action is
needed to send the reform to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Congress is in recess until late January. That gives nonsigners a
few weeks to reconsider. Gallegly and Ose in particular should be
consistent with their co-sponsorship of the bill and sign the
discharge petition. All of California would thank them. As for House
leaders, they can hide behind parliamentary rules but they cannot
escape responsibility for blocking legislation that is supported
overwhelmingly by the American public, regardless of party.</TE>

<LD>Junichiro Koizumi, Japan's prime minister, was a firebrand on the
campaign trail, promising a radical overhaul of the creaky Japanese
economic system. But lately he's been backtracking. Koizumi is
letting the yen plunge in value--at around 132 to the dollar it has
lost more than at any other time since 1971--and is talking about
using public funds to prop up the banking system. Both developments
are bad for Japan, its neighbors and the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Permitting the yen to depreciate has been Japan's tried-and-true
formula for avoiding reform. A lower yen means that Japanese exports
become cheaper and imports more expensive. This allows Japan to sell
more goods abroad while avoiding opening up its closed system to the
U.S. and others. The result is that the banking and industrial
cartels that run Japan are not challenged by market forces from
abroad. But the economic situation has deteriorated so much that it's
unlikely that a fall in the yen would be enough to revive the
economy. Instead, it could drag down China and South Korea. Their
currencies will lose value and their economies will suffer as it
becomes more difficult for them to export to Japan. China has already
demanded that Tokyo ''take responsibility'' and move to stabilize
Asian economies.</LD>
<TE>   As difficult as it may be to imagine, the Japanese economy, which
has been mired in recession, is getting even worse. The most recent
industrial production figures showed a 13.1% drop, the biggest since
1975. Retail sales are down 2.7%, and orders for construction
projects fell 6.9% over the past year.</TE>
<TE>   Cleaning house is the first step to reviving the economy. Banks
have to admit to the bad loans they made to industry, and obsolete
and redundant businesses need to be shut down. Despite all the bad
news, lethargy rules.</TE>
<TE>   It would take great boldness and stamina to overcome the inertia
and entrenched interests in the bureaucracy and the Liberal
Democratic Party, which don't want any change. Functionaries cling to
a discredited system that allows them to control the economy and dole
out patronage.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi looks increasingly ineffectual. Washington needs to at
least reiterate that there is no substitute for real reform.</TE>

<HD>An Easy Call, Mr. Ashcroft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Each day that prisoner No. 13371-179 languishes in a federal jail in
Houston further tarnishes Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's less-than-shiny
reputation as a protector of this nation's freedoms.</LD>
<LD>   Almost six months ago, a Texas judge ordered Vanessa Leggett, an
aspiring author and freelance journalist, locked up on contempt
charges. Her crime was refusing to obey a federal grand jury subpoena
demanding she turn over to a U.S. prosecutor notes and tape
recordings of interviews she had conducted while researching a book
she hoped to write about an infamous 1997 Houston homicide.</LD>
<LD>   Leggett says she promised anonymity to many of those she
interviewed. She went to jail rather than violate that trust and has
lived behind bars, with drug dealers and thieves, far longer than
most reporters who have followed the time-honored journalistic
practice of resisting such subpoenas.</LD>
<TE>   The case hinges on the issue of credentials. The prosecutor, eager
to have Leggett help him do his job, says she is not affiliated with
any news organization and thus is not a journalist. If Ashcroft had a
better understanding of the 1st Amendment, he'd pick up the phone and
tell his underling, "You're not the one to determine that!"</TE>
<TE>   Leggett, 33, had published only two pieces, one in an obscure
magazine and the other in a law enforcement handbook. But respected
organizations such as the New York-based Committee to Protect
Journalists have not hesitated to embrace her as a member of the
trade and blast the government for its arrogant assault on her
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Defining "journalist" is tricky. When people with ulterior motives
pose as journalists--as CIA agents have done, as Al Qaeda operatives
did in September in assassinating Afghan leader Ahmed Shah Masoud--it
undermines the ability of legitimate reporters to do their jobs. In
some nations, journalists must show credentials. Even in the U.S.
there are scattered calls to license members of the Fourth Estate.
But the power to decide who is a legitimate journalist is the power
to censor, and that's not something defenders of civil liberties are
eager to turn over to anyone.</TE>
<TE>   So journalists must define their fraternity broadly--even if that
means including a few flakes. More important, prosecutors, courts and
lawmakers must embrace this intentionally loose definition and extend
all protections to these surrogates for the public--including a
prohibition against agents of the state trying to coerce a journalist
into becoming their involuntary private investigator.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, the contempt finding against Leggett must be
withdrawn when the grand jury that issued the subpoena
disbands--which is supposed to happen Friday. Then the U.S.
attorney's office will have a choice: Seek another subpoena demanding
Leggett's reportage or listen to the journalists organizations
calling for her freedom. Ashcroft is struggling with some hard calls
on  civil liberties these days. This isn't one of them.</TE>

<HD>State Bar Education Is Guilty of Fraud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your insightful Dec. 28 article on the state bar's continuing
education programs is long overdue ("Keeping State's Lawyers on Their
Toes). Only bar journals to date have reported the disgust attorneys
have for this sham. Continuing education serves but three purposes:
It gives the public the impression that it has better-qualified
attorneys and that the state bar is cognizant of public needs and is
responding to them; and it gives promoters of continuing education
classes continuing income.</LD>
<LD>   As you point out, the public is not getting better attorneys. The
courses taken have little or no relevance to the attorneys' practice.
To meet my requirements I had to take courses on patents, how to
negotiate a tort claim and nutrition. I did none of this work. When I
suggested doing volunteer work for a federal agency that was relevant
to my practice, I was turned down, as this wasn't an "approved"
course.</LD>
<LD>   The state bar is not aware of what benefits the public, or it
would revamp the system. Attorneys have written volumes to the state
bar on how to make the continuing education system viable. The state
bar turns a deaf ear to its membership and the public.</LD>
<TE>   The only ones who benefit from this system are the promoters who
have state-bar-approved courses to offer to a captive audience. It is
little wonder that attendees at these courses read the newspaper,
catch up on office work or skip out after registering and return when
the certificates are handed out. They know a waste of time when they
see it.</TE>

Positive stories such as these are not just educational but greatly

<LD>Thanks to Alexander Cockburn for reminding progressives that all
advocates are not equal ("An Enron Tale of Strange Bedfellows,"
Commentary, Dec. 28). The Natural Resources Defense Council has a
number of positions to answer for. Its joining with Edison and other
private utilities in recommending a no vote on Proposition 9's
attempt to fix deregulation of the electric industry followed its
affirmation of Enron as described by Cockburn.</LD>
<LD>   More recently, it has remained silent on the Playa Vista
development's impact on the Ballona Wetlands. No wonder, then, that
environmental attorney Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would opine against
Ralph Nader's run against a Democratic Party equally mute on these
same issues. Perhaps a glance at the NRDC's donor list might explain
the aforementioned lapses.</LD>

<TE>   Bravo, Mr. Cockburn. It takes literary courage and accuracy to
call it as it is. Many of us have torn up membership cards in the
scourge of corporate environmentalism (spelled compromise). Every
panic letter about the environment (and I've received a plethora of
them, as an environmentalist since 1971), accompanied by an urgent
"please send today" postcard and a more urgent plea for money to
"fight the cause," is a red flag waving to me: Will the (paid)
representatives of the organization really represent the
environmental issue with integrity?</TE>
<TE>   For the last five or 10 years my answer would be "no." It seems
that keeping the staffs of the organizations paid is often more
important than representing the issues.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re " 'On Call' but Not Replying," Dec. 29: I thought doctors had a
creed they espoused upon graduating from medical school, to provide
care to their fellow man when needed, and that they entered the
profession to provide a service that only "the best of the best" were
deemed qualified to perform. Instead, greed and arrogance have
replaced these very principles.</LD>
<LD>   Shame on those doctors who failed to answer the call because they
were tired or too busy or, worse yet, might not get paid because some
indigent patient may have, say, been run over by a drunk driver or
injured in some other way out of his or her control. How sad that
emergency room physicians and nurses have had to beg for the services
of these pompous, self-serving individuals who claim to be
caregivers. What we need is an anonymous hotline for health care
professionals who wish to turn in these arrogant scofflaws who
routinely thumb their noses at the anti-dumping statute because they
know their peers will not report them out of fear of retribution.</LD>

<TE>   Your article points out the basic reasons why many specialists are
not willing to take emergency calls, and all of them point to not
being paid for services, with an honorable mention for liability and
never being so much as thanked. There is a basic sense of entitlement
the public has. Members of the public demand high-tech, highly
trained individuals to take care of them, but they want it free. The
insurance companies are quick to chastise physicians for not
responding, but they certainly don't want to come up with the funds
to guarantee their payment. Doctors, having been left unpaid for tens
of thousands of dollars or more for services to participants in HMOs,
have been taught not to participate in these programs--not for not
being paid enough but for not being paid at all.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, I had a blocked kitchen drain. Before the plumber left,
he demanded $100 payment for about 10 minutes of work. How much is it
worth to have a few severed fingers saved or to repair multiple dog
bites to the face? Truthfully, it's tough to get compensated a couple
of hundred dollars from the insurance companies. The public wants us
there and demands that we be there but is not willing to pay us. For
the plumber the checkbook is in hand.</TE>

underappreciated and wonder why I should bother with the onerous
inconvenience of calls for service from doctors when they call at 3
a.m. for help when their safety is under attack. I think I will sleep
in until I know for sure if a doctor can pay or is willing to pay my
meager wages for putting my life on the line for a (doctor) stranger.</TE>

<TE>   My father, Bearl L. Ginsburg, was clearly an old-fashioned
physician: He worked on his rare days off, canceled vacations for the
benefit of his patients' schedules and donated his time and skills
when he was asked or felt duty-bound to do so. He never had a
professional corporation (because he simply paid the personal taxes
he owed and because the thought of doctors organizing their business
lives to acquire wealth made him morally queasy). When I closed his
estate I found several cabinets of files for patients whom he never
charged.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Have we learned exactly nothing from Sept. 11? American Airlines
refused to transport a passenger because he had inconsistencies in
the paperwork that was supposed to allow him to fly commercially with
a gun ("Pilot's Concern Keeps Federal Agent Off Flight," Dec. 28).
Such inconsistencies are supposed to raise red flags to airline
security.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the politically correct crowd, the issue has been
reduced to ethnicity, as usual. And the agent in question, while
intelligent enough to be entrusted with the protection of the
president, could not manage to provide properly prepared forms that
were designed to keep killers off the plane in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   Every time commercial pilots take off, the life of every passenger
is in their hands. My hat is off to those who kept the agent off the
flight, as well as those who noticed the man with explosive shoes,
the unruly and belligerent passengers and anyone else threatening to
disrupt recent commercial flights. We want these people to be
diligent so we don't die on their planes. Let's praise their efforts
rather than complicate their job by telling them whom they can
suspect.</LD>

<HD>Jeffords Explains Why He Quit the GOP</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "My Way, the High Way," by Sen. James M. Jeffords, Opinion, Dec.
30: Bravo! JFK would have been proud to add Jeffords to his
chronicles of the brave and conscientious men in history who
exhibited a "profile in courage" when Americans needed to stand up to
political and philosophical bullies. We Americans need more men like
Jeffords to save our faith in American democracy and save us from the
self-annointed groups that would impose their dictates.</LD>
<LD>   Viva la independencia! Viva America!</LD>
<LD>   H. Robert Tarango</LD>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Starting with the headline, everything about Jeffords' pompous
sermon sounded fatuous and egotistical. Aren't we Americans so lucky
to have such a fearless and above-it-all man in the Senate! I think
not.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, Jeffords never has been a Republican. He knew throughout
2000 what George W. Bush's campaign platform included, and he didn't
make a critical peep during all that time. Then, when he couldn't get
his way and began to pout, he became the prime target for Sen. Tom
Daschle and Co. to go after to win him over. One can only speculate
as to the extent of the promises the Democrats made to overturn the
wishes of the voters and gain control of a Senate that was not
rightly theirs.</TE>
<TE>   I say, for shame, Jim Jeffords. You have disgraced the Senate with
your treachery and trickery.</TE>
<TE>   Robert B. Wolcott Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeffords' reason for leaving the Republican Party makes perfect
sense to me. His action was very courageous and well thought out, and
I'm glad he did it.</TE>
<TE>   I've been a bookkeeper for most of my adult life. My dad was an
accountant. Jeffords is absolutely right: Balance is everything!</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Hampton</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeffords changed the play at the line of scrimmage without
notifying his teammates. Heck, he wasn't even in the huddle to begin
with. Jeffords made a decision he wasn't elected to make. The proper
decision would have been to state his conscience, then resign. Let
the people decide which platform that particular Vermont Senate seat
should align itself with.</TE>
<TE>   Vermont made a choice, and Jeffords decided on his own account
that he knew better. What kind of conscience is that? "Where there is
no counsel, the people fall; but in the multitude of counselors there
is safety" (Proverbs 11:14). Jeffords was elected as a Republican,
and he should have accepted the counsel of his fellow Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Vermont will make another decision, and it will be to retire
Jeffords.</TE>

<LD>Resolutions for 2002: Face up to the fact that this is not a war. Our
"war" is not a standard war but a police action. Terrorist strikes

"war" is being used to disguise political changes at the expense of
health, education and civil rights. The inaccurate use of "war" is a
semantic scam.</LD>
<LD>   If terrorism is the killing of innocents, we first must admit our
past role in Germany, Japan, Vietnam, Latin America, the Middle East

<DL></DL>
<LD>I've been pondering those million-dollar settlements for the families
of victims of the terrorist attacks, and the idea still bothers me.</LD>
<LD>   It's that word, "million."</LD>
<LD>   I live in a neighborhood where there are no millionaires. Or at
least nobody lives like a millionaire. A new car on the block
attracts a crowd. Most people mow their own lawns and don't hire
gardeners. There is a plumber down the street, a retired liquor store
owner nearby, also a schoolteacher, an aerospace worker, a family
that runs a limo and tanning business, and a colleague from the
newspaper.</LD>
<TE>   I don't think people in my neighborhood give much thought to being
millionaires, except maybe in their lottery daydreams.</TE>
<TE>   The median income for a family in the U.S. is $42,148, according
to the 2000 Census. That means half the families live on less and
half on more.</TE>
<TE>   Numbers can be manipulated and made to say many things, I grant
you, and averages never account for individual circumstances. But let
me try to be straightforward.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government has offered the Sept. 11 families an average
settlement of $1.6 million, tax-free. Place that money in a Treasury
note at 5% and a family will live on $80,000 a year forever. This
yield too is tax-free, so it's the equivalent of $100,000-plus in
regular income, never touching the principal. That's not to mention
the thousands of dollars that survivors of victims have received from
charities in grants for rent, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the average family that lost someone to terrorists can live
on nearly 2those times what the median family in the U.S. earns. The
income of these survivors will continue unchanged after they retire,
while everyone else must save for their later years and then expect
reduced income.</TE>
<TE>   This is what bothers me.</TE>
<TE>   In the name of sympathy and fellowship, tax-paying families across
the country are creating a new class of millionaires. I understand,
or I think I do, the reasons for this entitlement. For one thing, the
government hopes to reduce the numbers and consequences of lawsuits.
For another, our collective national grief is many-fold larger than
the sum of its tragic parts.</TE>
<TE>   "An unprecedented display of taxpayer generosity," said the
special master of this new federal compensation fund.</TE>
<TE>   This bothers me too.</TE>
<TE>   We've all heard stories of the families that are grumbling about
this largess. The poster figure is the widow with two children who
lost her 29-year-old husband. He earned less than $25,000 a year as a
line chef at the World Trade Center. Still, the woman told The Times,
"I think $1.5 million is very little for us." Charities replaced her
clunker van and paid her rent months in advance. But she demands a
million for herself and a million each for her two children.</TE>
<TE>   Oh well, there is greed at every station of life.</TE>
<TE>   But what about the other Americans who lost loved ones, but not in
the crash of terrorist planes? Why aren't we compensating them for
their suffering and grief? Because terrorism is political, we're
told. We were all attacked and we're in it together.</TE>
<TE>   But isn't a hate crime the same thing--an American killed because
he looks Arab? Don't we have a collective stake in that too? What
about the gay man who is killed by a gang of rednecks who want to
impose their values on society? Isn't that Al Qaeda by a different
name? What about gangs that kill for money? Isn't money just as
political as religion? Is one murder really $1.6 million different
from another?</TE>
<TE>   You try to draw a line around Sept. 11, but it turns out to be a
ring of question marks.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's just the gross toll: the more dead, the bigger our
hearts. Well, since the terrorist attacks we can extrapolate and
calculate that 3,500 or so people have been murdered, about the same
as lost at the World Trade Center. Many of these were as innocent as
the victims of the airplane attacks. Is there any reason to believe
that the grief of their families is any less or their needs smaller?
In fact, aren't the charities that tend to these people strapped
because citizens directed their contributions to Sept. 11 victims?</TE>
<TE>   The total cost of the terrorist compensation payouts is expected
to reach $6 billion. That means every man, woman and child on my
block, and yours, and every block in the U.S., is being assessed $21
to make millionaires of one group of survivors. Many more unlucky
Americans are left to endure killings in their families without our
help. It doesn't seem right, and that's what bothers me.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By the way: Some Lutherans have expressed concern that my Dec. 16
column on religious intolerance did not specify which church is
opposed to interfaith prayer. It is the Lutheran Church-Missouri
Synod. The largest Lutheran church in the U.S., the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America, wants members to know that it supports
interfaith prayer.</TE>

<HD>Pull India, Pakistan From the Brink</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIREEN T. HUNTER</AU>
<BD>Shireen T. Hunter is the director of the Islam program
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even before the U.S. mission in Afghanistan has been completed and
that country has been stabilized, another conflict looms that could
be even more destabilizing for the region. Preventing war between
India and Pakistan, with their fledgling nuclear capabilities, has to
be of the highest order for the international community. The world
cannot afford to test whether the principle of deterrence can work in
this case as it did during the Cold War.</LD>
<LD>   How did we get to this point and how do we defuse it? The buildup
to this crisis shows how states can be brought to the brink of
conflict by the actions of groups that fall outside of government
control, even if, at some point, they had seemed to be useful.</LD>
<LD>   This certainly has been true regarding two extremist groups,
Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, which allegedly masterminded
and carried out the Dec. 13 attack on the Indian Parliament. Indeed,
the two groups represent a larger phenomenon in Pakistan: the
radicalization of a segment of Pakistani Muslims deriving from the
Soviet-Afghan war and the belief by some segments of Pakistan's
military and political establishment that such groups could help
achieve the country's strategic and political goals.</LD>
<TE>   It was a similar misguided perception that led Pakistan to nurture
and support the Taliban in Afghanistan and to try to use similar
groups in the Kashmir conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there was a downside. The activities of some Muslim extremist
groups promoted sectarian tensions in Pakistan and the deepening of
internal divisions. Thus even before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
President Pervez Musharraf had begun to rein in these extremist
groups. Because of intense domestic pressures, the crackdown was not
extended to groups engaged in Kashmir. This has proved to be a
cardinal mistake.</TE>
<TE>   India's outrage over the attack on its Parliament--the symbol of
its statehood and democracy--is understandable. Its demand that the
perpetrators be brought to justice and that the Pakistani government
dismantle these extremist groups is equally justified. But the vital
question is whether threatening full-scale war can achieve these
goals, or could it instead result in a war that, despite India's vast
military superiority, would not leave the nation unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a Pakistani government faced with the threat of major
war and needing the support of all political groups will be less able
to confront its extremist groups. Indeed, the more threatening and
unyielding India's posture, the harder it will be for Musharraf to
meet India's legitimate demands, lest he be viewed as buckling under
Indian pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Even if India were to score a decisive victory, a war--assuming
that nuclear disaster were avoided--cannot solve India's problem of
terrorism emanating from Pakistan. On the contrary, an unstable and
fragmented Pakistan could become an even more dangerous haven for
terrorists and extremists than Afghanistan. India must also consider
the ramifications of its actions against Pakistan in the context of
Islambad's ties with countries such as China.</TE>
<TE>   Viewed in a sober light, India has an interest in a stable
Pakistan, one able and willing to work diligently to rid itself of
Islamic radicalization. Other nations, most notably the U.S., have a
vital interest in Pakistan's stability, not only because of its
crucial role in stabilizing Afghanistan and in the fight against
terrorism but also because of its position on the Arabian Sea and
astride main oil routes.</TE>
<TE>   Both India and Pakistan have their hawks; the question is how the
international community can help the two sides resist succumbing to
their influence and instead retreat from the brink of war.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has been active. Europe, especially Britain, with its
Commonwealth ties, is becoming more active. Russia, which has played
a constructive role in the Afghan crisis and has close relations with
India, should use its influence.</TE>
<TE>   If war can be averted, then the international community must help
the two countries begin to address various problems, most notably the
question of Kashmir, and work toward a more stable regional
environment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Finally, a reporter had the temerity to question Bush on Friday
regarding the ignominious collapse of Enron Corp. run by Kenneth L.
Lay, a Bush family intimate and top campaign contributor. Bush
expressed concern "for the citizens of Houston who worked for Enron
who lost life savings" and added: "It's very important for us to
fully understand the 'whys' of Enron."</LD>
<LD>   Sure is, but did Bush never ask "Kenny Boy"--his nickname for
Enron's chairman--what was going on?</LD>
<LD>   After all, not only was Kenny Boy one of Bush's major
contributors, but it was Lay and Enron that Bush turned to for
critical advice on how to further exploit U.S. natural resources.</LD>
<TE>   The media, which had hounded Bill Clinton on his Whitewater
connections, have allowed Bush to maintain the fiction that his--and
his father's--administration had nothing to do with the debacle that
is Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Given the intense interest in the list of those who slept over in
the Clinton White House, it's odd that no attention has been paid to
Kenny Boy's sleepover in the early years of the senior Bush's White
House.</TE>
<TE>   Those early Bush years were crucial for Enron, beginning with the
passage of the 1992 Energy Policy Act, which forced the established
utility companies to carry Enron's electricity sales on their wires.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Wendy Gramm, who served under the elder Bush as
chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, allowed for an
exemption in the trading of energy derivatives, which, as the
Washington Post reported, "later became Enron's most lucrative
business."</TE>
<TE>   Once that was accomplished, Gramm, wife of Texas GOP Sen. Phil
Gramm, resigned from her government post to take a position on the
Enron board. As one of the members of the board's audit committee,
she now is expected to be a key figure in the lawsuits and federal
investigation revolving around Enron's collapse. Recently, the chief
executive of Arthur Andersen, Enron's outside auditor, told a
congressional committee that the accounting firm had warned the Enron
audit committee of what he termed "possible illegal acts within the
company."</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Gramm is also mentioned in a bank lawsuit alleging insider
trading as having sold $276,912 in Enron stock in November 1998. Her
response is that she sold the stock to avoid the appearance of a
conflict of interest, given that her husband was chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Yet she was still very much on the Enron board and being rewarded
with future stock options when her husband last year pushed through
legislation that exempted key elements of Enron's energy business
from oversight by the federal government. Phil Gramm had obtained
$97,350 in political contributions from Enron over the years, so
perhaps he was acting on his own instincts and not his wife's
urgings. The exemption was passed over the objection of the Clinton
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Gramm also directs the regulatory studies program at George
Mason University, which has received $50,000 from Enron since 1996.
Her academic institute is highly influential in arguing for
deregulation, conveniently joining her corporate and academic
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for true-believer deregulators, the Enron collapse
shreds their panacea. Surely no one, least of all Wendy Gramm, who
has said she was kept unaware of the company's chicanery in hiding
debt and conducting secret private deals to the detriment of
stockholders, could argue today with a straight face that Enron was
in need of less government oversight.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that there would be no Enron as we know it were it not
for Republican-engineered changes in government regulation that
permitted Enron its meteoric growth.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that the corporation had its allies among the Democrats;
campaign finance corruption and influence peddling are generally a
cover-all-your-bets bipartisan activity. But in this case, the
amounts given to Democrats were puny and late, and there's no doubt
that Enron rode to power primarily on the strength of Lay's influence
with the Bush family. This fact is not mitigated by Enron now hiring
Clinton's former lawyer and various top Democratic lobbying groups,
except to note that these hired guns have no shame.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush family ties to Kenny Boy Lay are just too intimate and
lucrative to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   There also are at least four Enron consultants and executives who
hold high positions within the Bush White House, and some of them may
be drawn into the investigations that cannot be avoided, despite the
distractions of the war on terror.</TE>
<TE>   As John Dean once famously said of the Nixon administration, there
is a cancer growing on the presidency, but in this case it's name is
Enron, and it won't go away by being ignored.</TE>

<HD>A Time to Value Our World of Worry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIBLEY TELHAMI</AU>
<BD> Shibley Telhami is a professor of government and
politics at the University of Maryland.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I watched our two children, ages 6 and 8, play with their presents by
the Christmas tree with infectious excitement. But, for the first
time since they were born, I could barely hide my worries for the new
year.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, I worried about the vulnerability that the horror of
Sept. 11 brought and about the sobering turn in the economy. But I
had deeper fears: Will my generation fail our children by making the
wrong decisions? Three concerns in particular soured my holiday mood.</LD>
<LD>   First, I worried about the quick reversal from a sense of
unprecedented vulnerability to a sense of unequaled strength after
the military success in Afghanistan. There is something healing about
this turnaround. But what concerns me is the wild swings in mood that
may be carried to extremes.</LD>
<TE>   As a student of U.S. foreign policy, I am well aware of pushing
isolationism to the tragic extreme in the case of Pearl Harbor and
interventionism to its painful end in Vietnam. These swings usually
took a generation. But in today's world and with the absence of
constraints, they can take place in a matter of months. Already, one
hears talk of the wonders of modern weapons that can do so much
without jeopardizing many American lives, and there are voices
calling for more ambitious missions, carried out alone if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, I worry about war with Iraq. Ultimately the U.S.
has the power to prevail, but weapons of mass destruction almost
certainly would be used by Iraq in any war to topple its government.
We know it has chemical, biological and possibly radiological
weapons. We know Saddam Hussein is ruthless enough to use them. One
thing has prevented him from using them: his own survival. Go after
him and he will surely use them.</TE>
<TE>   There is a big difference between madness and ruthlessness, and
Hussein is guilty of the second but not the first. That's why it is
perplexing to hear that we can live with the damage of war now
because it will be worse if he acquires nuclear weapons. We should do
all we can to prevent him from acquiring such weapons, but if he
does, he can be deterred because the man and his regime want to
survive. Why is it that most of Iraq's neighbors who have to bear the
consequences of Hussein's ruthlessness oppose such a war, while we
propose it for their sakes?</TE>
<TE>   Second, I feel grateful for our capacity to strike at the
merchants of death, the Osama bin Ladens of the world. But I fear
that in our apparent quick success we are ignoring a painful reality:
Terrorism has a "supply side" and a "demand side," and unless we
address both we will not remove the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists are often politically ambitious individuals, but they
succeed in large part because they can exploit public despair, which
allows them to find ready recruits, to raise funds and to play to
public opinion. If one supplier is destroyed, others will try to
exploit the demand. The most horrifying aspect of the September
attacks is how easy it is to commit terror in today's world if you
have people willing to die.</TE>
<TE>   The demand side is not so much driven by poverty or inequality,
although on the extreme ends these are factors. Two words capture
public demand better: humiliation and hopelessness. If our military
actions succeed in destroying one supplier of terror but in the
process increase public humiliation and hopelessness, other suppliers
will surely try to exploit the demand.</TE>
<TE>   The military side of the campaign on terror is necessary but
insufficient for winning the war. If we spend a fraction of the
energies we now use on the military campaign to address the political
sources of humiliation and hopelessness, such as the Arab-Israeli
conflict, we would stand a far better chance of winning. Although I
see the terror suppliers on the defensive today, public humiliation
and helplessness in the Middle East are on the increase.</TE>
<TE>   Third, I am concerned about the sanctity of our nation's
principles. I raise my two children to be egalitarian and proud
Americans. I remind them that, at the end of the day, they must be
able to look themselves in the mirror. I want them to be strong and
to succeed but not through a route that will change them in the
process. I want our country to be a model to which people aspire, to
be powerful enough to defeat its enemies but also strong enough to be
compassionate, to be driven by the values that make it great but
never to forget that the ends, no matter how noble, cannot justify
any means.</TE>
<TE>   May my generation possess the wisdom to overcome the pain of Sept.
11 and its new sense of power. Let us not take shortcuts on civil
liberties at home and on compassion abroad, and may we succeed
without losing what we stand for.</TE>

<LD>   It's time for comfort desserts. Forget calories; think pleasure.
Homey desserts are what count here, not complex presentations or
preparations.</LD>
<TE>   Here are my all-time comfort dessert winners. This Warm Toffee
Pudding Cake with creme fraiche is what a comfort dessert is all
about--homey, warm and sweet. Gail Forsberg, a Chicago pastry chef,
shared the recipe with me.</TE>
<TE>   Baked Alaska Ice Cream Pie runs a close second. It can be made
with various flavored ice creams, but my preference is for coffee
java chip. The Warm Bittersweet Sauce is spooned over the soft
meringue and cold ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   The desserts can be made in advance and frozen.</TE>
<TE>   Plate and napkin from Williams-Sonoma stores. Creme fraiche can be
found in the dairy case of well-stocked supermarkets.</TE>

<TE>   Warm Toffee Pudding Cake</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour 30
minutes, plus 1 hour chilling</TE>
<TE>   CAKE</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound pitted dates</TE>
<TE>   2 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour, divided</TE>
<TE>   2 1/3 cups boiling water</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons baking soda</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons baking powder</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Creme fraiche, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Set aside a greased 10-inch
springform (wrap the exterior of the pan tightly in foil if it tends
to leak).</TE>
<TE>   Place the dates and 2 tablespoons of the flour in a food processor
and process until very finely minced, about 40 seconds. Transfer to a
bowl. Stir in the boiling water and baking soda. Refrigerate for 1
hour or let stand until completely cooled (the date mixture should
not be warm when mixed into the batter).</TE>
<TE>   Use a mixer to cream the butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla until
smooth. Sift the remaining 2 cups of flour, baking powder and salt.</TE>
<TE>   Add the date mixture to the egg mixture alternating with the flour
mixture, mixing until smooth and flowing. Transfer the batter to the
prepared pan. Place the pan on a baking sheet (for easier handling).</TE>
<TE>   Bake the cake until browned and a toothpick inserted into the
center comes out clean, about 1 hour, 10 minutes. Remove the cake
from the oven. Set a broiler pan about 5 inches from the heat source
to catch any drips from the cake; heat the broiler.</TE>
<TE>   While the cake is hot, use a thin metal or wooden skewer to poke
holes all over the top of the cake. Spread the toffee topping slowly
over the cake to allow it to be absorbed; also spread it as evenly as
possible. Broil until the top is bubbly, rotating as necessary, about
1 minute--do not let the topping burn. (The cake can be cooled and
kept at room temperature overnight, lightly covered, or frozen as
long as 1 month, wrapped airtight. To serve, reheat, covered with
foil, in a 350-degree oven until warmed through, about 20 minutes. It
can also be taken directly from the freezer and reheated, covered
with foil, in a 350-degree oven, about 40 minutes.) Serve the cake
warm with a dollop of creme fraiche.</TE>
<TE>   TOFFEE TOPPING</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup light brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   While the pudding cake is baking, place the butter, sugar and
cream in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until
combined and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</TE>

<TE>   Baked Alaska Coffee</TE>
<TE>   Ice Cream Pie</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes, plus 8 hours
freezing</TE>
<TE>   1 (1/2-pound) piece poundcake, edges trimmed, cut into
1/4-inch-thick slices</TE>
<TE>   3 pints coffee java chip ice cream, softened</TE>
<TE>   6 egg whites</TE>
<TE>   1 1/3 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar</TE>
<TE>   Warm Bittersweet Sauce, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Line a 9-inch pie plate with the poundcake slices, very slightly
overlapping. Through plastic wrap, flatten the cake with your hands
to compact it into the plate. Trim the top edges as needed. Freeze
the cake until solid, about 3 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Spoon the ice cream into the frozen cake shell. Smooth the top,
shaping it into a dome. Freeze until hard, 3 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the egg whites, sugar and cream of tartar in the bowl of an
electric mixer to stiff peaks. Spread the meringue over the hard ice
cream; swirl to make a decorative pattern. Alternately, spread a
1/2-inch thick layer of meringue over the hard ice cream; smooth with
a long spatula. Then spoon the remaining meringue into a pastry bag
with a large (#7) star tip; decorate the top with large rosettes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, place a rack about 7 inches under the broiler element
and heat the broiler.</TE>
<TE>   Broil until the meringue is golden, 5 to 6 minutes. (You can also
use a propane torch.) Freeze until frozen, 2 to 3 hours. (The pie can
be kept frozen, covered loosely with plastic wrap, up to 5 days.)</TE>
<TE>   To serve, remove the pie from the freezer 20 minutes before
serving. Cut it into wedges. Pass the Warm Bittersweet Sauce
separately.</TE>
<TE>   8 servings. Each serving with 1 tablespoon of sauce: 461 calories;
214 mg sodium; 50 mg cholesterol; 16 grams fat; 8 grams saturated
fat; 76 grams carbohydrates; 7 grams protein; 1.47 grams fiber.</TE>

<TE>   1/3 cup whole milk</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   Dash salt</TE>
<TE>   Cook the chocolate, butter, sugar, milk and cream in the top of a
double boiler set over, but not touching, gently simmering water,
stirring often, until smooth, about 8 to 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the sauce from the heat. Stir in the vanilla and salt.
Serve warm. (This can be made ahead and refrigerated up to 1 week or
frozen up to 1 month. Gently reheat in the microwave oven at 50%
power or in a double boiler over boiling water until warm and
flowing.)</TE>

<LD>The Kyrgyz, who live in the mountains between Uzbekistan and
westernmost China, have a drink called ak kuiruk chai, or "white tail
tea"--tea flavored with milk and melted sheep tail fat.</LD>
<LD>   * Saucy Sauces for $200: This sauce first appeared in English
literature in William Makepeace Thackeray's "Memoirs of a Gourmand"
(1841). (Answer: What is mayonnaise?)</LD>
<LD>   * Here and there, cooks have developed a taste for coloring foods
green with herbs, red or yellow with spices such as saffron and
chiles and blue or purple with fruits or flowers. At one time,
European cooks used the fabric dye cochineal to create a red. But in
the medieval Middle East, cooks regularly used fabric dyes such as
madder, ochre, vermilion and indigo. They considered indigo to be
good for you, but a modern doctor might have some doubt about
vermilion (mercuric sulfide).</LD>
<TE>   * In the 19th century, there was a fashion for "motto lozenges":
hard candies with messages buried in them that would eventually
become visible--if you took care not to crunch the candy as it melted
away in your mouth. The anti-alcohol movement took advantage of this
to make lozenges that would leave you with a sobering message like
"Drink is the ruin of man." The problem, of course, was finding
alcoholics who were careful how they sucked on motto lozenges.</TE>
<TE>   * Recipe names you couldn't get away with these days: In "The
Virginia Housewife" (1824), there's a recipe called Nice Buns.</TE>

<HD>THE FIRST FEAST of the NEW YEAR</HD>
<DH>Grace Masuda's annual weekend-after-New Year's party is an
inspiring mix of the traditional and the contemporary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Black beans glistening with gold leaf; pink fish cake stuffed with a
ruffly green shiso leaf and cream cheese; little cakes shaped like
persimmons and peonies--these and other Japanese delicacies as
exquisite as gems spilling from a treasure chest will cover the table
at Grace Masuda's home Saturday in the Naples area of Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Masuda, a third-generation Japanese-American (sansei), works for
days fashioning hundreds of dainty tidbits for her annual New Year's
party. She cuts carrots into tiny koi fish for the New Year's soup.
She strings sweetened black beans on pine needles for a ritual dish
that symbolizes health and well-being and ties little bundles of food
with seaweed or green onion strands. Then she carves turnips into
feathery chrysanthemums, and fills the holes in slices of lotus root
with tiny orange fish roe.</LD>
<LD>   While most Japanese observe the new year Jan. 1, for the last
seven years, Masuda has celebrated the following weekend.</LD>
<TE>   "Since many of my friends were single and had other family
obligations on New Year's Day, I've always had my gatherings the
Saturday following New Year's," she says. "I ask each of my friends
to bring a Japanese dish, and I usually make about 15 dishes, which
are often new Japanese recipes translated for me."</TE>
<TE>   Masuda's interest in cooking is fueled by years of work in hotel
catering. Most recently she assisted Christian Rassinoux, executive
chef of the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel, with administrative duties,
event coordination and management of the kitchen staff. Now retired,
she has even more time to orchestrate elaborate events such as the
New Year's party, which she starts planning a month in advance.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the ornamental, bite-sized foods will be artfully arranged
in a set of three lacquer boxes called ojubako. Tradition allots one
box to foods that represent the sea, another to foods from the
fields, the third to foods that represent the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Mochi (soft rice cakes made from glutinous rice) are essential to
the celebration. They symbolize strength, health, wealth, good
fortune and good harvest, Masuda says. Broiled mochi go into the
soup, ozoni, which is the first dish tasted as the New Year arrives.
Broiling makes the outside of the mochi crisp and the inner part
meltingly tender.</TE>
<TE>   Stacked mochi, real or simulated, decorate Japanese homes for New
Year. The large mochi on the bottom represents the older generation
and a strong foundation. The small mochi on top represents the new
generation. Kombu (kelp) placed between is for happiness, and the
tangerine that crowns the arrangement represents happiness and
prosperity bestowed by one generation on the next.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Los Angeles, Masuda inherited New Year's traditions from
her parents. They annually pounded out 100 pounds of mochi, which
they gave to friends. When Masuda first went to Japan, she was
surprised to learn that most women there don't cook New Year's
dishes. They buy them ready-made. "It does take a lot of work," she
admits.</TE>
<TE>   Those who do cook start a week before the holiday. "All the food
has to be made in advance," Masuda says. During the holiday, the
women usually don't cook for three days. "They have friends drop by,
and they go visit friends. For the Japanese, New Year's is more of a
time to be with the family, to be with close friends."</TE>
<TE>   New Year's requires not only special food but a fresh start. "It
is traditional that the Japanese start the new year with their house
all cleaned, their bills all paid. In Japan, the utility people would
come to the door so you could pay your bills." Masuda remembers that
from the time she lived in Japan, years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in Fresno--the family moved there after being interned
during World War II--Masuda recalls how she and her three sisters
were required to scrub the walls of the family home. "I remember most
of my New Year's Eves were spent helping my mother to cook. My
parents would have 60 people come, and we had 15 in the family, so we
had to have plenty of food."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Masuda has invited about 25 friends in addition to
family members. "The evening begins with a smooth 'Golden Sake' toast
and cheer, followed with the traditional New Year's soup. We then eat
like there's no tomorrow," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Straight sake is not popular with her friends so her husband, Ray
Imatani, a surgeon, blends it with Grand Marnier, one teaspoon to a
jigger of the rice wine.</TE>
<TE>   Their home is a blend of East and West. A vintage wedding kimono
hangs on the wall in the living room. A collection of chopsticks lies
on a golden tray on the chest that serves as a coffee table. Japanese
tea pots, wooden molds, fans and other objects stand in niches in the
wall. A screen that once belonged to Masuda's mother forms the
backdrop for a striking, simple flower arrangement--Masuda is a
student of Japanese floral design, ikebana.</TE>
<TE>   A golden screen, ornamented with kimono fabric, decorates the wall
in the dining room, just beyond the open kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Certain foods are mandatory for the new year, but each holiday
Masuda adds a few nontraditional dishes. Contemporary innovations
include shrimp coated with broken somen noodles and wrapped with a
band of nori (dried seaweed), beef rolls that show a checkerboard
design of julienned carrot and daikon at the edges and daikon slices
folded over crab meat and tied with a strand of green onion. Except
for the soup, the food is served cold, or at room temperature.</TE>
<TE>   When she revisits Japan, Masuda brings back kitchen equipment such
as bowls, cutters, even gold- and silver-flecked rice paper on which
to place dainty cakes. The gold leaf that she will sprinkle over the
black beans on pine needles comes from Kyoto. The gold, obviously,
stands for wealth. The pine needles represent longevity and seasonal
regeneration, she says. Only three beans are placed on each needle.
Four is considered an unlucky number.</TE>
<TE>   Masuda gets the pine needles from the backyard of her daughter,
Lisa Okamoto, who lives in Aliso Viejo. If they are not stiff enough
to penetrate the cooked beans, she guides them through with a metal
needle.</TE>
<TE>   The New Year's party is not an isolated event. "My husband and I
entertain a lot," she says. Masuda records each dinner party, adding
comments on the food and revisions. "I have thousands of recipes in
my computer," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Not only does she cook for the new year, but she designs the
invitations, organizes entertaining activities and arranges a group
photo that will be sent to each guest.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese word for the new year celebration is oshogatsu, and
the conventional greeting is, "Akemashite omedeto gozaimasu." People
sometimes shorten this to "akemashite," Masuda says: "The rest is
courtesy."</TE>

<TE>   Sweet Rice Flour Chicken (Mochiko Chicken)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour plus
4 hours marinating</TE>
<TE>   This is not a traditional dish, but it's one of the comfort foods
many Japanese families serve. When this dish came out about 20 years
ago, Grace Masuda began making it for her family's New Year, and it's
become a regular dish.</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup mirin (sweet sake)</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon grated ginger root</TE>
<TE>   6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, about 1 1/2 pounds, cut in
half lengthwise</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs, beaten</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup milk</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup peanut oil</TE>
<TE>   Combine the soy sauce, mirin, sugar, garlic and ginger root. Add
the chicken, cover and marinate in the refrigerator 4 to 6 hours.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 minutes before serving, combine the eggs and milk. Heat
the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip the chicken in the
egg mixture, then in the sweet rice flour to coat. Fry the chicken
until browned, 20 minutes.Cool slightly and cut diagonally into 1/4
inch-thick slices.</TE>

<TE>   Shrimp Crusted With Japanese Noodles</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Cut-up somen noodles make an unusual "breading" for shrimp. Buy
the palest somen you can find.</TE>
<TE>   4 cups oil, for deep frying</TE>
<TE>   10 medium shrimp with tails on, shelled and deveined</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sake</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup cornstarch, sifted</TE>
<TE>   2 egg yolks, lightly beaten</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon water</TE>
<TE>   2 ounces white somen noodles, broken into 1/4-inch pieces</TE>
<TE>   10 (3 1/2x1/2-inch) strips dried seaweed</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, cut small slits along the inside of each shrimp so that
they can be straightened. Cut the tips of the tails off and discard;
squeeze any water from the shrimp using a paper towel. Dip each
shrimp into sake. Sprinkle both sides with salt, then coat with the
cornstarch, shaking off the excess.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the egg yolks and water in a bowl. Dip each shrimp into
the yolk mixture, then roll in the somen pieces, covering completely.
Wrap a strip of seaweed around the middle of each shrimp. Secure the
ends with a little of the yolk mixture.</TE>
<TE>   When the oil has reached 350 degrees, add the shrimp and fry until
brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately or at
room temperature.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Year's Soup (Ozoni)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, this is the first food many families eat, even at
midnight on Dec. 31. This soup includes many symbolic foods. The pink
part of the steamed fish cake (kamaboko) represents the rising sun of
the Japan flag for patriotism, and the white part represents purity
and honesty. The pounded rice cake (mochi) symbolizes happiness,
wealth and good health. The spinach, chicken, shiitake, fish cake,
lemon zest and seaweed can be prepared in advance, refrigerated in a
large flat container and added immediately before serving the soup.</TE>
<TE>   JAPANESE SOUP STOCK (DASHI)</TE>
<TE>   1 (4-inch) square dried kelp (kombo)</TE>
<TE>   5 cups cold water</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup flaked dried bonito (katsuobushi)</TE>
<TE>   Wipe off the white powder on the kelp with a damp cloth. Cut
1/2-inch fringes along the edges. Place the water in a saucepan and
add the kelp. Bring almost to a boil, uncovered, over medium heat.
Remove the kelp. Bring the water to a boil again. Stir the flaked
bonito into the pot. Let stand until the flakes settle to the bottom,
about 2 to 3 minutes. Strain through a double thickness of damp
cheesecloth or through a fine strainer. Makes 4 cups.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   1/4 bunch spinach or nappa cabbage leaves</TE>
<TE>   1 boneless skinless chicken breast</TE>
<TE>   3 dried shiitake mushrooms</TE>
<TE>   5 fresh rice cakes (mochi)</TE>
<TE>   10 pieces pink-edged steamed fish cake, cut into 1/4-inch slices</TE>
<TE>   5 (1 1/4x1/8-inch) strips lemon zest, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Dried seaweed (nori), cut into 1/4-inch squares, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Blanch the spinach or nappa cabbage in boiling water. Rinse it in
cold water, squeeze it dry, then cut into 1 1/2-inch lengths. Poach
the chicken in water until cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Slice it
into small pieces</TE>
<TE>   Soften the mushrooms in water for 10 minutes. Remove the hard
stems and discard, then slice the mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately before serving, broil the rice cakes until lightly
browned. Heat the soup stock and spoon into individual bowls. To each
serving, add some of the spinach, chicken and mushrooms and 1 rice
cake. Then top with fish cake. Garnish with lemon zest and seaweed
pieces.</TE>
<TE>   5 servings. Each serving: 222 calories; 139 mg sodium; 37 mg
cholesterol; 2 grams fat; 0 saturated fat; 33 grams carbohydrates; 17
grams protein; 1.26 grams fiber.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sweetened Black Soy Beans (Kuromame)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 5 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Total Preparation Time: 8 hours, 5 minutes plus 8 hours soaking</TE>
<TE>   This is a must to serve on Japanese New Year. Black beans are a
congratulatory dish and symbolize having an active, healthy life. If
you have the time, serve them the traditional way, threaded on pine
needles, which represent longevity and seasonal regeneration. If the
pine needles are too fragile to pierce the beans, poke a hole with a
needle or other thin sharp tool. Thread three beans on each pine
needle, leaving space between the beans. Gently pile them on a
platter to serve and sprinkle with gold leaf flakes as a garnish.
Before threading, wash the pine needles with soap and rinse well.</TE>
<TE>   1 pound dried black soy beans</TE>
<TE>   2 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon baking soda</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   Wash and soak the beans overnight in water to cover generously.
Drain, reserving 4 cups of the soaking liquid. Place the beans in a
Dutch oven or very large saucepan. Add the reserved liquid, the
sugar, baking soda, salt and soy sauce. Bring to a boil. Remove the
scum from the top and add 2 tablespoons of cold water. Cover and
simmer over very low heat until the beans are tender, about 8 hours.
Do not remove the lid during this process. Remove the pot from the
heat and let the beans cool.</TE>
<TE>   5 cups. Each tablespoon: 41 calories; 142 mg sodium; 0
cholesterol; 1 gram fat; 0 saturated fat; 6 grams carbohydrates; 2
grams protein; 0.01 gram fiber.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fish Cake Rolled in Nappa Leaves</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   This is one of Grace Masuda's modernized New Year's foods.</TE>
<TE>   8 to 10 nappa cabbage leaves</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 pink-edged fish cake</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   Dash monosodium glutamate, optional</TE>
<TE>   Blanch the cabbage in lightly salted boiling water until just
softened, about 3 minutes, then immediately chill in cold water.
Drain well and dry the leaves with paper towels or in a salad
spinner. Remove the hard core.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the fish cake lengthwise into halves or thirds, making sure
that there is some pink in every piece. Slice into matchsticks.</TE>
<TE>   On the bottom of a cabbage leaf, place a bundle of 10 slices. Roll
up the leaf. If large leaves are used, tuck in the edges as you roll,
like a burrito. If small leaves are used, allow the pink part of the
fish cake to show at the sides. Continue until all the leaves are
filled. Dry with a paper towel after rolling. Place the rolls, leaf
tip side down, on a paper towel-lined platter, cover and refrigerate.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the vinegar, sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt and the monosodium
glutamate in a small bowl. Refrigerate.</TE>
<TE>   To serve, diagonally slice the rolls made with large leaves and
stand on a serving plate cut side up. Pour the dressing over the
rolls.</TE>
<TE>   20 pieces. Each piece: 25 calories; 142 mg sodium; 1 mg

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beef-Vegetable Roll</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 50 minutes</TE>
<TE>   In Japanese markets, sliced beef for this dish is labeled yakiniku
meat. It is thicker than meat cut for sukiyaki or shabu-shabu and
easier to roll.</TE>
<TE>   1 carrot</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound daikon</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound thinly sliced beef rib-eye (yakiniku)</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon sake</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon grated ginger root</TE>
<TE>   Cut the carrot into 3-by-1/4-inch sticks. Blanch in lightly salted
boiling water until soft yet crisp, about 3 minutes. Drain and set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the daikon into sticks the same size as the carrots. Blanch in
the same water until soft-crisp, about 1 minute.</TE>
<TE>   Place 1 carrot stick and 1 daikon stick on the narrow end of a
beef slice. Place a daikon stick on top of the first carrot stick and
a carrot stick on top of the first daikon stick to give a
checkerboard appearance from the side. Roll the beef around the
vegetables, placing seam side down.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the soy sauce, sugar, sake, garlic and ginger root in a
large skillet over medium-low heat and cook until the sugar has
dissolved, about 2 minutes.Add the meat rolls, seam side down. Cook,
turning until all sides are cooked, 12 to 15 minutes. The seam side
will take the longest, about 4 to 5 minutes.Cool.</TE>
<TE>   Slice diagonally in half. Arrange on a platter with the diagonal
cut on top.</TE>
<TE>   10 rolls. Each roll: 125 calories; 457 mg sodium; 24 mg
cholesterol; 7 grams fat; 3 grams saturated fat; 7 grams
carbohydrates; 8 grams protein; 0.59 gram fiber.</TE>

<LD>"I've come late to Gruner Veltliner; I've resisted, but resistance is
now futile. I never understood Gruner Veltliner, I never got the
point of it; it always seemed like a Riesling wannabe, not as flashy,
as aromatic or as obvious in charm. But I now get Gruner, I
understand it, I'm delighted by it.... I can't keep the vintages
straight, but the two producers I like are Loibner and Brundlmayer.
They're extremely rich, concentrated and yet very light and
refreshing. They're sort of like these 250-pound linebackers that can
run the 50-yard dash in, like, one second. I like best their
incredible food-friendliness. They're best with Asian cuisine. They
have wonderful acidity and lightness and a refreshing quality that
marries with spicy foods. They are great food wines."</LD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DEAR SOS: Several years ago you published a marvelous apple pie
recipe. I think the name was Apple Pie Babalu. It has a pecan-caramel
topping. Our friends and family love it. But--you guessed it--we
can't find the recipe.</LD>
<LD>   LINDA NEAL</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   DEAR LINDA: Here you go. It's from Babalu Restaurant in Santa
Monica.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Babalu Caramel Pecan Apple Pie</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 45 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 2 hours 35
minutes plus 45 minutes chilling</TE>
<TE>   PIE CRUST</TE>
<TE>   3 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 cup (2 sticks) cold butter, cut into small pieces</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup ice water</TE>
<TE>   Grease a 9-inch pie pan and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the flour, sugar and salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in the
butter. Work the dough with your fingers or a pastry cutter to form
coarse crumbs. Add the ice water and mix lightly until a stiff dough
is formed. Shape the dough into a disk, cover and refrigerate until
chilled, about 45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Divide the dough in half. Roll out one half and place it over the
pie pan, allowing the edges to hang over slightly from the rim. Roll
out the other half, the top crust, and place it on wax paper.
Refrigerate until ready to use.</TE>
<TE>   FILLING</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   6 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and sliced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter, cut in 4 pieces</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 325 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the lemon juice, apples, flour, sugar and cinnamon in a
bowl. Mound the filling over the bottom crust. Dot with the butter.
Top with the rolled top crust. Trim the edges and fold under and
crimp. Cut a few slashes in the top crust for ventilation.</TE>
<TE>   Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake until the crust is golden
brown, 1 hour, 15 minutes to 1 hour, 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   CARAMEL TOPPING</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons light corn syrup</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons cold butter, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 cup pecan halves</TE>
<TE>   Combine the sugar and corn syrup in a saucepan. Stir constantly
over high heat until the mixture dissolves and turns a rich caramel
color, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and slowly stir
in the whipping cream and butter until smooth.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the Caramel Topping over the crust and cover with the pecans.
Line the baking sheet with foil, return the pie to the sheet and bake
until the nuts are toasted, another 10 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   The Moroccan Veggie Curry From Vegas</TE>
<TE>   DEAR SOS: I would love to have the recipe for curried potatoes and
garbanzo beans that is served at the Spice Market Buffet at Aladdin
Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. This Moroccan stew is one of the best
dishes I've tasted and would love to prepare it at home. I'll be
forever grateful for a recipe.</TE>
<TE>   CARMEN ROSE</TE>
<TE>   Pico Rivera</TE>
<TE>   DEAR CARMEN: It was a while in coming, but it's a wonderful stew,
loaded with beans, vegetables and curry. It will make a great side or
main dish for a party buffet. To make it vegetarian, use vegetable
stock. Chef Rodolfo Volpe suggests serving it with roasted leg of
lamb, tandoori chicken skewers or grilled curry fish filets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aladdin Curried Garbanzo Beans and Potatoes</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Look for cans of Madras curry powder at Indian and Asian markets,
Indian curry powder at Indian markets and small cans of Thai curry
paste at Asian markets.</TE>
<TE>   2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup diced celery</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup diced white onion</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup diced carrots</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced garlic</TE>
<TE>   3 bay leaves</TE>
<TE>   4 to 5 cups chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon Madras curry powder</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon Indian curry powder</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon Thai curry paste</TE>
<TE>   1 pound boiling potatoes, peeled and diced</TE>
<TE>   2 (16-ounce) cans garbanzo beans</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup chopped parsley, divided</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
celery, onion and carrots and cook until the onion is translucent,
about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and bay leaves and cook 2
minutes more. Add 2 cups of chicken stock, the cayenne pepper,
oregano, Madras and Indian curry powders, curry paste, potatoes and
garbanzo beans. Stir to combine well. At this point, the stock should
cover 3/4 of the mixture; if necessary, add more stock. Season with
salt and pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the remaining stock in a saucepan over medium-low heat.</TE>
<TE>   Add 1/4 cup of parsley to the skillet. Bring the stew to a boil,
reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the vegetables are soft,
45 minutes to 1 hour. As the stock evaporates, add 1/2 cup warm stock
to the stew at a time, as though making a risotto. The stew will
thicken as it cooks.</TE>
<TE>   Just before serving, stir in the remaining parsley. Transfer the
stew to a warm tureen or bowl to serve.</TE>

<HD>Who Needs Balsamic? A Plea for Tarragon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, vinegar mostly came in two types, cider and
distilled. If you looked around, you might find red wine vinegar,
maybe even white wine or rice wine vinegar.</LD>
<LD>   Then the foodie explosion of the '70s led to all sorts of doctored
vinegars. Vinegar appeals to the kitchen tinkerer because it can't
spoil, so you can add flavorings to it without risk. Why not throw in
mint or basil or sage? Garlic, hot chiles, tangerine peel?</LD>
<LD>   Great fun. And then came the fruit vinegars. A couple of years
back, the words "raspberry vinegar" were splattered all over every
self-respecting restaurant menu.</LD>
<TE>   Finally we got to the hard stuff, balsamic vinegar, and it's been
a balsamic world ever since. In a neighborhood supermarket, I
recently counted 10 brands of imported balsamic vinegar and two
domestic brands, to say nothing of a "white balsamic" and three
fruit-flavored balsamics: peach, strawberry and raspberry.</TE>
<TE>   Balsamic vinegar is made from concentrated grape juice, and behind
its sharpness there's a gentle sweetness. Clearly it has what a lot
of people were really looking for in a vinegar--rich flavor combined
with an acidity level that doesn't punish the mouth.</TE>
<TE>   But we already had a vinegar of that description decades earlier:
tarragon vinegar, a staple in gourmet pantries of the 1940s and '50s.
The sweet, licorice-like flavor of tarragon neatly tames the power of
acetic acid while adding a perfume of its own.</TE>
<TE>   How it reduces the sharp impression of acetic acid is kind of a
mystery. Food science writer Harold McGee points out that tarragon
does contain some sugar, about 4% by weight, but this doesn't explain
the tarragon effect by itself. "In a 750-ml bottle of vinegar," he
points out, "to reach the minimum detectable level of sweetness,
you'd have to add 75 grams of tarragon, or about three ounces, which
is kind of a lot of tarragon.</TE>
<TE>   "But there may be an element of 'olfactory hallucination'
involved," McGee continues. "Tarragon contains an aromatic compound
called allyl anisole, which has an anise-like scent. It's also
described as a sweet scent. I've always had a little problem with
that--how can something smell sweet when sweetness is detected on the
tongue?--but there may be some psychological interaction between the
small amount of sugar in the tarragon and the 'sweet' aroma that
takes the edge off vinegar."</TE>
<TE>   However tarragon works its magic, the resulting vinegar is more
versatile than balsamic. One day I had two slices of country ham, so
I decided to make a sort of shepherd's pie; or, rather, swineherd's
pie, I suppose. I fried up a bunch of onions with the ham, put the
mixture in a pan and covered it with mashed potatoes. It was good ...
it was perfectly fine. But a few drops of tarragon vinegar put it
over the top.</TE>
<TE>   Balsamic vinegar, on the other hand, would have ruined it. Like a
powerful red wine, balsamic vinegar can easily overwhelm a dish.
Tarragon vinegar has better manners.</TE>
<TE>   And boy, it's easy to make these days, now that fresh tarragon is
readily available in supermarkets. Why aren't people taking those
leftover sprigs of tarragon they don't know what to do with and
sticking them in a bottle of plain, non-balsamic vinegar? That
wouldn't be tinkering. That would be a grand old tradition.</TE>

<HD>Pinot Gris Charms Hardened Chardonnay Fans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES E. OLKEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A couple of times a year we have neighborhood get-togethers. Since
I'm usually deputized to bring the wine, I try to sneak in a little
informal market research at the same time by watching people's
reactions to the wines I've brought. Most of my neighbors aren't
sophisticated wine drinkers, but they do enjoy it, and their
reactions have pretty accurately predicted some of the bigger recent
trends in table wines, such as the coming of age of Chardonnay and
now the swing back to red wine.</LD>
<LD>   Among the things I was looking for this year was a possible shift
away from Merlot. That one certainly didn't pan out--Merlot is still
the first choice for a glass of red. But I also wanted to gauge how
people would react to Pinot Gris. When I open a bottle of this wine
for friends, they nearly always like it, and it sells well in
restaurants. But many retailers say they rarely get customers asking
for it.</LD>
<LD>   So this year I slipped in a couple of Pinot Gris among the
collection of Chardonnays and Rieslings. The Chardonnays were emptied
first, but the Pinot Gris was the hit of the evening. Its light,
wonderfully fruity flavors stand in stark contrast to the rich,
toasty, buttery style of so many Chardonnays. As often as not,
Chardonnay tries to bowl you over with its mass and depth. Pinot Gris
wins with charm and grace.</LD>
<TE>   This is a grape that travels under many different names. Pinot
Gris is what the French have lately come to call the grape, although
it is still called Tokay d'Alsace by some. In Italy, where it makes
wines that are fresh and fruity, though perhaps a bit thin, it is
called Pinot Grigio.</TE>
<TE>   It is made under both names in this country, but in Oregon it must
be called Pinot Gris (even though many Oregon versions taste more
like the light wines of Italy than the richer, fuller wines of
Alsace). Here in California, the wines run the gamut in style, and
the name on the label is rarely any guide to which style you'll find
inside.</TE>
<TE>   This confusion might be one reason why Pinot Gris is still a bit
of a slow mover in wine stores, but, if the reactions of my neighbors
are any indicator, it's only a matter of time before it catches
on--no matter what it's called.</TE>
<TE>   * 2000 Archery Summit "Vireton," Oregon, $24. This wine, a
proprietary blend of 80% Pinot Gris, 12% Chardonnay and 8% Pinot
Blanc, is quite unlike any of the more than four dozen others tasted
for this column. Whether its extra richness derives from Chardonnay
or from something else, this is an interesting take on Pinot Gris. It
is mouth-filling with an almost oily texture, somewhat in the manner
of the fleshiest versions from Alsace.</TE>
<TE>   * 2000 Benessere Pinot Grigio, Napa-Carneros, $18. Though it may
be called by an Italian name, this first-rate wine is more in the
Alsatian than the thinner Italian style. It's rich and well-stuffed
and offers a fascinating mix of peach, honey, flower and mineral
flavors. Its energy and depth of sweet fruit give it an unmistakably
Californian cast.</TE>
<TE>   * 2000 Edna Valley Vineyards Pinot Gris, Edna Valley, $16. A mix
of mineral notes, a subtle floweriness and a firm structure makes
this wine somewhat reminiscent of Pinot Grigio, but its higher
ripeness and fuller body are the handiwork of California's generous
sunshine. The wine balances a slight sweetness with bracing acidity.</TE>
<TE>   * 2000 Etude Winery Pinot Gris, Carneros, $18. Outgoing aromas of
apricots and ripe melons immediately mark this as one of the richer
West Coast Pinot Gris, and that early promise is followed up with
ripe and well-filled melon flavors with a hint of stoniness. The
slight sweetness is impeccably balanced by lively acidity, making
this wine equally at home as an aperitif or an accompaniment to light
meals.</TE>
<TE>   2000 J Wine Co. Pinot Gris, Russian River Valley, $16. A mix of
ripe yet bracing fruit places this wine halfway between Italy and
Alsace in character, but its juicy center is more Californian than
anything else. The fruit aromas and flavors--fresh pears and apricots
with a touch of sweet citrus--are direct and inviting and will make
this tasty wine another good choice either before or during a meal.</TE>
<TE>   $* 2000 King Estate Pinot Gris, Oregon, $13. I brought an earlier
vintage of this to a fund-raiser and I remember vividly how the
organizer walked up to me and said, "Charlie, what is this? It's
yummy." The newest version also earns that kind of praise for its
light peach and pear fruitiness and its firm, balanced, lively
finish.</TE>
<TE>   2000 Montevina Pinot Grigio, California, $9. Here is a wine
labeled Pinot Grigio that actually tastes like something you might
find in northern Italy. Its flavors are light and minerally with a
hint of peach, but it has the richer texture you'd expect of a
California wine.</TE>
<TE>   $* 2000 Pepi Winery Pinot Gris, Willamette Valley, $11. This
Kendall-Jackson brand scores with rich, slightly tart fruit underlain
by a tinge of mineral. At this price, its quiet charm makes it a real
bargain.</TE>
<TE>   $* 2000 Silvan Ridge Winery Pinot Gris, Willamette Valley, $12.
Another great bargain. This clean, slightly juicy, smooth-textured
wine delivers an engaging mix of mineral and lime flavors. It goes
down ever so easily, especially at its price.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Symbols</TE>
<TE>   ***A world-class wine, superb by any measure, the top 1% to 2% of
all wines tasted.</TE>
<TE>   **An exceptional wine, well worth the effort to find, 10% to 12%
of wines tasted.</TE>
<TE>   *An admirable wine, tasty, focused, attractive, about 25% of wines
tasted.</TE>
<TE>   No Rating: The best are quite pleasant and can be good buys when
moderately priced.</TE>
<TE>   $Good value for the money.</TE>
<TE>   Below average quality, to be avoided.</TE>

<HD>The Best Recipes of 2001</HD>
<DH>From red enchiladas to low-fat Indian fish, it was a very
good year.</DH>

<LD>There is a rhythm to life in the Los Angeles Times Test Kitchen. We
test between 15 and 20 recipes every week--everything that runs in
the newspaper. In a year, that's about 800 recipes. Without
organization and a tight schedule, nothing would ever get done.</LD>
<LD>   Mondays and Tuesdays start slow. Ideas are developed and dishes
are tinkered with. Advance preparations begin for recipes that will
be fully tested later in the week. Frequently, scouting trips are
made for the many props and bits of decoration that are used in
photographs.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesdays and Thursdays, the place is going full-steam. Dishes
come out of the testing side of the kitchen and go over to the
styling side to be made ready for their close-ups. Then they're taken
next-door to be photographed in our studio. Finally, they're brought
out to the testing table for the staff to sample.</LD>
<TE>   Then the pace subsides. Fridays are devoted to more advance
testing and to filming the two-minute "Quick Fix" videos that appear
every week on our Web site.</TE>
<TE>   But every once in a while, this rhythm is broken. A computer
message pops up: "You've got to come try this!" A parade of staffers
goes streaming into the kitchen. Everything stops while all
involved--writers, cooks, editors and photographers--gather around to
taste something really great.</TE>
<TE>   Then they run back to their desks to make notes. Because we all
know that at the end of the year there will be a test. That's when we
vote for our best recipes of the year.</TE>
<TE>   It could be anything. Because of the variety of stories and
recipes we offer, it could be a perfect Californio red enchilada or a
sublime chocolate truffle cake from a famous restaurant. It could be
a variation on a Cuban rice dish that takes less than 30 minutes to
prepare or an Indian-style sauce for grilled fish that offers
remarkably complex flavors at 4 grams of fat per serving.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the Los Angeles Times Test Kitchen is not to provide
the staff with delicious snacks--it's to ensure that every recipe we
publish works. But sometimes we exceed even our own expectations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Classic Red Enchiladas</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 35 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour *
Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   This recipe comes from an Oct. 24 cover story by Jacqueline
Higuera McMahan, who wrote "Rancho Cooking, Mexican and Californian
Recipes" (Sasquatch Books, $21.95). She says the red enchilada
symbolizes the fusion of native Mexican foods with some of the
favored ingredients brought over from Spain such as olives, olive oil
and cheeses. In her family, these enchiladas, done Californio-style,
with flour tortillas rather than corn, were served at every important
event but especially at barbecues. Try to make the enchiladas the day
before you need them because the red chiles will soak into the
tortillas and make the enchiladas even better. Buy the thinnest
tortillas you can find or use homemade.</TE>
<TE>   Olive oil</TE>
<TE>   5 onions, chopped</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon dried oregano</TE>
<TE>   4 cups Red Chile Sauce, divided</TE>
<TE>   10 flour tortillas</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds medium-sharp Cheddar cheese, grated</TE>
<TE>   1 cup pitted black olives or home-cured olives</TE>
<TE>   Oil 2 (15x10-inch) jellyroll pans.</TE>
<TE>   Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over low heat.
Add the onions; cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 20
minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and the oregano.</TE>
<TE>   Spoon 1 cup of Red Chile Sauce onto a wide dinner plate. Starting
with 1 tortilla, dip both sides in the sauce. Place 1/2 cup of grated
cheese, 2 olives and 1/3 cup of cooked onions down the middle of the
tortilla. (We never added grated hard-boiled eggs, but many rancho
families did.) Lastly, roll the sides of each tortilla over the
filling. Place the enchilada, folded side down, on one of the pans.
Repeat with the remaining tortillas. Pour the remaining Red Chile
Sauce over the enchiladas. Sprinkle the remaining cheese in a strip
down the middle of each enchilada. Decorate with any remaining
olives. Cover the pans and refrigerate the enchiladas until you are
ready to bake them. Let them stand at room temperature 1 hour before
baking.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees near serving time.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the enchiladas until they are puffed and the cheese has
melted, 20 to 25 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Red Chile Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Red Chile Sauce, the pride of the kitchen, was used not only for
the famous red enchiladas but countless other favorites such as Chile
Colorado and tamales. This sauce differentiates itself by the toasted
flour roux used to deepen flavors and the tiny bit of vinegar used to
"sweeten" the chile.</TE>
<TE>   18 dried California or New Mexican chiles, or a combination of
both</TE>
<TE>   2 ancho chiles</TE>
<TE>   3 cloves garlic</TE>
<TE>   3 1/2 cups water, divided</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons light-flavored olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons ground oregano</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon cider vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Dash sugar, if necessary</TE>
<TE>   1/2 to 1 cup water or mild chicken broth, to thin sauce</TE>
<TE>   Hold the California and ancho chiles under running water to rinse.
Use scissors to cut off the chiles' stems and cut the chiles in half.
Shake out the seeds onto a paper towel. (Put the seeds in your garden
for the birds. Place the chiles and garlic in the top half of a
steamer set over simmering water. Steam for 25 minutes. This
technique, as opposed to soaking dried chiles in boiling water,
preserves more of the chile flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the chiles from the heat. Place 1/3 of the chiles in a
blender with 1 cup of water. Puree until smooth. Pour the puree into
a wire strainer nested over a large bowl. Continue pureeing the rest
of the chiles, garlic and water as in the previous step, in batches,
so that you add 1/3 of the chiles each time. Push all of the chile
puree through the strainer using a spatula or wooden spoon. Be sure
to scrape off the chile puree clinging to the bottom of the strainer.
Pour the remaining water into the blender and turn it on to help
clean the blades. Pour this chile water through the strainer to catch
the last bit of goodness. You should now have about 3 1/2 cups chile
puree.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat and add the
flour, toasting lightly until light nut brown, stirring, 4 to 5
minutes. Whisk in the chile puree and add the oregano, vinegar and
salt. Simmer the sauce for 20 minutes to blend flavors. Taste, and if
the sauce seems a bit sharp, add sugar. If the sauce seems thick, add
water or broth, simmering again for about 5 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Slow-Cooked Strawberry Preserves</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 1/2 hours
plus 3 hours standing</TE>
<TE>   Some jams are all about capturing the freshness of a fruit's
flavor. This recipe from local preserve maker Edon Waycott, which ran
July 11, takes advantage of the extra complexity that comes with long
cooking. Starting your day with a spoonful of this jam would be
luxury indeed.</TE>
<TE>   3 to 4 quarts fresh strawberries, about 12 pint baskets</TE>
<TE>   2 cups sugar, or to taste</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons lemon or lime juice</TE>
<TE>   Lightly rinse the berries without submerging them in water. Remove
the hulls, leaving the berries whole. Combine the berries, sugar and
juice in a non-aluminum bowl. Allow them to macerate at room
temperature, stirring occasionally, for at least 3 to 4 hours. The
mixture can be covered and refrigerated overnight at this point.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the mixture into a wide, shallow 6- to 8-quart saucepan and
set the pan over high heat. Bring to a boil, skim the foam that
collects on the surface, then reduce the heat to low. Make sure
bubbles continue to break the surface. After about 20 minutes, the
berries will give up additional juices and appear to be floating.
Continue cooking them, stirring more often, and skimming the foam for
about 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   The jam is almost done when it turns dark red and the ratio of
berries to juice is about equal. Watch and stir the jam often.
Refrigerate and use within several days, or can in the usual way.</TE>

plus chilling</TE>
<TE>   There are times when you want a dessert that's drop-dead decadent
(see the Peanut Butter Cream Pie and Chocolate Truffle Cake). But
most of the time what you're looking for is something that's a little
sweet, with complex flavors, but won't leave you feeling like lead.
This vibrantly flavored ice from Donna Deane's April 8 "The Lighter
Side" column was one of our favorite desserts this year, and it has
only 143 calories, without any fat.</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   4 cups water</TE>
<TE>   4 cups rhubarb cut into 1-inch pieces</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup raspberry-flavored vodka</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons lime juice</TE>
<TE>   Mint leaves and raspberries, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Combine the sugar and water in a 3-quart saucepan and bring it to
a boil. Add the rhubarb. Return to a boil, then reduce the heat and
simmer until the rhubarb is soft and falling apart, about 5 minutes.
Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Strain the pulp and discard it. Combine the rhubarb syrup with the
vodka and lime juice.</TE>
<TE>   Freeze the mixture in an ice cream maker according to the

<TE>   Chocolate Truffle Cake</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 25 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes
plus 1 hour chilling</TE>
<TE>   This recipe from French Laundry chef Thomas Keller's March 7
"Professional Help" column is almost more of a molten-centered
chocolate souffle than a cake. The batter can be prepared up to 1
hour ahead and left at room temperature to be baked at the last
minute. Or you can make it even more in advance, freeze it, then pop
it straight into the oven. The baking time in that case will increase
to 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   GANACHE</TE>
<TE>   2 ounces semisweet chocolate</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   Grate the chocolate and place it in a bowl. Bring the whipping
cream just to a boil and pour it over the chocolate. Slowly stir
until smooth. Transfer the mixture into a shallow glass dish and let
it cool slightly, about 10 minutes, then place it in the freezer to
chill, 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   Scoop out 5 balls using a 1/2-teaspoon measuring spoon and shape
them so they're round. Chill until ready to use.</TE>
<TE>   CAKE</TE>
<TE>   14 ounces bittersweet chocolate</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) butter</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon flour</TE>
<TE>   10 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   7 tablespoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   Powdered sugar, for dusting</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler set
over, but not touching, simmering water. Stir in the flour and remove
from the heat to cool slightly.</TE>
<TE>   Whip the yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer and slowly add the
sugar until the whisk leaves a thick ribbon that stays on top of the
batter when it is lifted out, about 5 minutes. Pour the chocolate
into the yolk-sugar mixture and gently fold them together.</TE>
<TE>   Spray 10 (1/2-cup) ramekins with cooking spray. Half-fill each
with chocolate batter, place 1 ganache ball in the center and then
continue filling to the top with more batter. Place the ramekins on a
rimmed baking sheet. (The recipe can be made ahead to this point up
to 1 hour in advance and stored at room temperature, or 1 week in
advance and frozen, tightly covered.)</TE>
<TE>   Bake the cakes until they begin to pull away from the sides of the
ramekins, 13 to 15 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar.</TE>

<TE>   Hazelnut Crisps</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes
plus 1 hour chilling</TE>
<TE>   This is the second year in a row that well-known cookbook author
Deborah Madison has placed a recipe on our top 10. From a Jan. 31
story praising hazelnuts comes this definitive simple nut cookie:
fragile, crisp and very good.</TE>
<TE>   1 cup toasted hazelnuts</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon granulated sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1 egg yolk</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   Grind or pulse the hazelnuts with the granulated sugar in a food
processor until fine, but with a few chunks scattered throughout.</TE>
<TE>   Cream the butter and brown sugar with the salt until light and
fluffy, then stir in the vanilla and egg yolk. Stir in the hazelnuts
and the flour.</TE>
<TE>   Shape the dough into a rough log, wrap it in wax paper or plastic
wrap, then run the dough between your thumb and forefinger to force
it into a cylinder about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Keep it round, or
square the sides. Refrigerate the dough until firm, at least 1 hour,
preferably longer.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the log into 1/3- to 1/4-inch thick slices and place them on 2
baking sheets, leaving at least 2 inches between each piece. Bake
until lightly browned on top, about 15 minutes. Remove the crisps to
a rack to cool; they'll get crispier.</TE>

<TE>   Grilled Halibut With Indian-Spiced Cauliflower Puree</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Deep flavors and luscious textures don't necessarily mean food
that's high in fat. Times Test Kitchen director Donna Deane coated
fish with tandoori spicing and turned some normally humble vegetables
into a complex Indian style stew for her "The Lighter Side Column" on
Aug. 1. The result is a main course that delivers big-time taste
despite having only 4 grams of fat.</TE>
<TE>   4 (5-ounce) halibut filets</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons tandoori paste</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, sliced</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced ginger root</TE>
<TE>   1/2 head cauliflower, broken into florets (about 1/2 pound)</TE>
<TE>   1 small white boiling potato, peeled and cubed</TE>
<TE>   1 cup water</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground coriander</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons lime juice</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Cilantro sprigs, lime wedges, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Place the fish filets in a shallow glass dish. Spread the tandoori
paste over all sides. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate while
preparing the cauliflower puree.</TE>
<TE>   Spray a skillet with nonstick spray. Cook the onion and garlic,
covered, over medium-low heat until the onion is tender, about 10
minutes, stirring occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   Add the ginger, cauliflower, potato and water. Bring to a simmer.
Cover and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Puree the vegetables in a blender until smooth. Blend in the
cumin, coriander, turmeric, salt and lime juice. Keep the puree warm.</TE>
<TE>   Lightly spray both sides of the filets with nonstick spray. Grill
the sea bass over hot coals or use an indoor grill pan until the fish
flakes easily with a fork, about 3 to 5 minutes per side. Lightly
season with salt after turning the fish over.</TE>

<TE>   Heirloom Tomato Risotto</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 50 minutes * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   Ojai cook Anna Thomas, a screenwriter ("El Norte" and "Mi
Familia") and cookbook author ("The Vegetarian Epicure"), came up
with this risotto for an Oct. 10 story on the very Californian
pleasures of cooking close to home. She makes this risotto with
tomatoes grown by the farmer who lives just down the hill from her
house. Really, it's a fairly straightforward dish--the technique is
that of any good risotto. The secret of this dish is finding the
right tomatoes--a combination of several varieties works best, but
the most important thing is to make sure they are really ripe and
flavorful. Then be careful not to overcook them. The swirl of bright
tomato colors against the pale rice is what makes this risotto so
beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 to 3 pounds tomatoes, preferably heirloom varieties</TE>
<TE>   3 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   7 to 8 cups vegetable broth</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 cups Arborio rice</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup dry white wine</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</TE>
<TE>   Pepper</TE>
<TE>   Bring a pot of water to boil. Cut a shallow "x" in the bottom of
each tomato and place the tomatoes in the water. Cook 30 seconds,
remove and rinse under cold water. Peel the tomatoes with a tip of a
knife. Core the tomatoes and cut them in large wedges or 11/2-inch
chunks, preserving their juice.</TE>
<TE>   Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a nonstick pan over medium
heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, about 1 minute. Add the
tomatoes and some salt and simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring only
once or twice.</TE>
<TE>   In a large nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 11/2 tablespoons
of olive oil over medium heat and cook the onion with a dash of salt
until it begins to turn golden, 5 to 6 minutes. In another saucepan,
heat the vegetable broth to just below a simmer and keep it hot.</TE>
<TE>   Add the rice to the onion and stir it gently for 2 or 3 minutes.
Pour in the wine and stir immediately as it is absorbed.</TE>
<TE>   Add a soup ladle of hot broth to the rice and stir with a wooden
spoon (so you don't ruin your pan), keeping the mixture just at a
simmer. When the broth is nearly absorbed, add another ladleful and
keep stirring. Continue this way, adding the broth a bit at a time
and stirring almost constantly. After about 15 minutes, add the
cooked tomatoes with their juice and stir until the juice is nearly
absorbed, then continue adding broth as before until the rice is al
dente. This process will take about 25 minutes, and at the end you
will have a creamy sauce around rice grains that are tender but firm
and studded with brightly colored pieces of tomato.</TE>
<TE>   Remove from the heat, stir in the basil and the Parmesan cheese,
taste, adjust the salt and add pepper if desired. Add a last ladle of
broth, give a final stir and spoon the risotto into bowls. Pass the
additional Parmesan cheese at the table.</TE>

<TE>   Sun-Dried-Tomato-Stuffed Eggs</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Total Preparation Time: 1 hour 15 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Times Test Kitchen intern Mary Ellen Rae thought up these stuffed
eggs for an April 11 story on an Easter buffet. They're best the day
they're made. If that is impossible, you can make them a day ahead,
up to the point of piping the filling into the eggs. Just keep
everything refrigerated, and press plastic wrap directly onto the
surface of the yolk mixture to keep it fresh. Then fill the eggs just
before serving.</TE>
<TE>   12 eggs</TE>
<TE>   8 sun-dried tomatoes (not in oil)</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons capers, drained and chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 large shallot, finely minced</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup mayonnaise</TE>
<TE>   4 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil, divided</TE>
<TE>   Place the 12 eggs in a large saucepan. Fill with cool water. Bring
the water to boil over medium heat. As soon as it boils, reduce the
heat to simmer and cook the eggs 20 minutes. Fill a bowl with ice
cubes and cold water and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, place the sun-dried tomatoes in a microwave-safe bowl
and cover them with water. Microwave for 2 minutes, then let the
tomatoes sit several minutes until they have softened. Drain on paper
towels, then finely mince.</TE>
<TE>   When the eggs are cooked, lift them from the pan using a slotted
spoon and place them in the cold water. Chill completely, then peel
and slice them in half lengthwise. Remove the yolks and push them
through a potato ricer or a mesh strainer to break them up into small
pieces. This will help make a smoother mixture.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the yolks, tomatoes, capers, shallot, mustard, mayonnaise
and 2 tablespoons of basil in a small bowl. Stir to combine.</TE>
<TE>   If the egg whites are inclined to roll around on a plate, cut a
very thin slice off the bottom. Fill a pastry bag fitted with the
star tip with the egg yolk mixture. Pipe the filling into the egg
whites, then garnish the eggs with the remaining basil. If you don't
have a pastry bag, you can cut the tip off a resealable bag to pipe
in the filling, or use a teaspoon. Cover the eggs with plastic wrap
and refrigerate until ready to serve.</TE>

<CX>   Incorrect directions - In the Chocolate Truffle Cake that ran as
part of the "Top 10 Recipes" (Jan. 2), you need to make 10 ganache balls
rather than the five called for. Here is the correct recipe.</CX>
<CX>Chocolate Truffle Cake</CX>
<CX>   Active Work Time: 25 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes plus
1 hour chilling</CX>
<CX>    This recipe from French Laundry chef Thomas Keller's March 7
"Professional Help" column is almost more of a molten-centered chocolate
souffle than a cake. The batter can be prepared up to 1 hour ahead and
left at room temperature to be baked at the last minute. Or you can make
it even more in advance, freeze it, then pop it straight into the oven.
The baking time in that case will increase to 20 minutes.</CX>
<CX>    *</CX>
<CX>   GANACHE</CX>
<CX>   2 ounces semisweet chocolate</CX>
<CX>   1/4 cup whipping cream</CX>
<CX>   Grate the chocolate and place it in a bowl. Bring the whipping cream
just to a boil and pour it over the chocolate. Slowly stir until smooth.
Transfer the mixture into a shallow glass dish and let it cool slightly,
about 10 minutes, then place it in the freezer to chill, 1 hour.</CX>
<CX>   *</CX>
<CX>   Scoop out 10 balls using a 1/2-teaspoon measuring spoon and shape them
so they're round. Chill until ready to use.</CX>
<CX>   *</CX>
<CX>   CAKE</CX>
<CX>   *</CX>
<CX>   14 ounces bittersweet chocolate</CX>
<CX>   1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) butter</CX>
<CX>   1 tablespoon flour</CX>
<CX>   10 egg yolks</CX>
<CX>   7 tablespoons sugar</CX>
<CX>   Nonstick cooking spray</CX>
<CX>   Powdered sugar, for dusting</CX>
<CX>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</CX>
<CX>   *</CX>
<CX>   Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler set over,
but not touching, simmering water. Stir in the flour and remove from the
heat to cool slightly.</CX>
<CX>   Whip the yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer and slowly add the
sugar until the whisk leaves a thick ribbon that stays on top of the
batter when it is lifted out, about 5 minutes. Pour the chocolate into
the yolk-sugar mixture and gently fold them together.</CX>
<CX>   Spray 10 (1/2-cup) ramekins with cooking spray. Half-fill each with
chocolate batter, place 1 ganache ball in the center and then continue
filling to the top with more batter. Place the ramekins on a rimmed
baking sheet. (The recipe can be made ahead to this point up to 1 hour in
advance and stored at room temperature, or 1 week in advance and frozen,
tightly covered.)</CX>
<CX>   Bake the cakes until they begin to pull away from the sides of the
ramekins, 13 to 15 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar.</CX>

<BD>TIMES FOOD EDITOR</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A well-written recipe is a thing of beauty. Without going all
postmodernist on you, that's true quite apart from how the dish it
describes tastes. Theoretically, you could have a perfectly written
recipe for how to prepare a perfectly awful dish. Well, come to think
of it, that's not really all that theoretical, is it?</LD>
<LD>   What brings this to mind is Dorie Greenspan's new book "Chocolate
Desserts by Pierre Herme" (Little, Brown and Co., $40). Well,
obviously it's not just her book. After all, Herme is one of the most
famous pastry chefs in France, and the dishes are undoubtedly his
creations.</LD>
<LD>   But the descriptions of how they are made are Greenspan's, and
that is what separates this from so many other big-deal chef books.
Greenspan is one of the few recipe writers who is able to convey an
actual sense of voice. Read her instructions and you sense a real
person there, someone who is a good cook, who has prepared this
recipe before and who is there to help you should you stumble.</LD>
<TE>   This comes across in a series of asides that fit seamlessly into
the directions. When you're mixing the batter for the "saucer-sized
spicy chocolate sables," for example, Greenspan is at your elbow with
a warning: "This is a delicate dough and you don't want to overmix
it, so stop as soon as the last speck of flour disappears. You'll
have a very soft dough."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the canny advice in the recipe for creme brulee:
After you've beaten some of the hot milk into the yolk mixture (to
"acclimatize" them), "rap the bowl against the counter to burst any
bubbles, then pour the custard through a strainer into a pitcher."
Isn't that a neat trick?</TE>
<TE>   For cookbook fans--or should I say "recipe-writer fans"?--this is
not news. Greenspan has a history of taking on such projects,
starting in 1996, when she wrote the recipes for the companion book
to Julia Child's PBS series "Baking With Julia." In 1998 she did
"Desserts by Pierre Herme"; in 1999 it was "Daniel Boulud's Cafe
Boulud Cookbook."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it's a little scary to think about what "Chocolate" might
have been like without Greenspan's hand. The dishes are probably
delicious, and the photography by Jean-Louis Bloch-Laine is
sumptuous--dessert getting the kind of carefully lit, strikingly
composed treatment usually afforded only to movie stars and new cars.</TE>
<TE>   But given all that, without Greenspan's calming influence, the
recipes seem the type to induce fainting spells among readers who are
not professional pastry chefs (or who didn't just buy it for the
pictures). These are all-day undertakings, for the most part,
requiring the preparation of several sub-recipes. They're as much
construction projects as desserts.</TE>
<TE>   But hey, who buys a book by a French pastry chef if they're not
interested in putting in some quality kitchen time?</TE>
<TE>   And look at it this way: All that work just gives you the
opportunity to more deeply appreciate what a beautiful thing a truly
well-written recipe is.</TE>

<DH>2000 Patricia Green Cellars Pinot Noir, Oregon</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winemaker Patricia Green made her reputation at Torii Mor winery in
Oregon. In the spring of 2000, though, she and her cellar master,
James Anderson, bought the old Autumn Wind Winery and re-christened
it Patricia Green Cellars. Green has a wonderful feel for Pinot Noir
and her first efforts under the new label are just now arriving on
the market. This one, her basic Pinot Noir, is a bargain--an
affordable Pinot with varietal character and depth that is drinking
beautifully now.</LD>
<LD>   Keep an eye out, too, for her single-vineyard Pinot Noirs, Eason
and Balcombe Block 1B, both of which ratchet the quality up a good
notch or two. Quantities of all these wines are limited, but they're
not impossible to find.</LD>
<LD>   About $20. Available at the Wine House in West Los Angeles, (310)
479-3731; Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, (949) 650-8463; Wine
Exchange in Orange, (714) 974-1454; Woodland Hills Wine Co. in
Woodland Hills, (818) 222-1111; Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido,
(760) 745-1200; and Barons in San Diego, (858) 481-2323. If you can't
find this wine, have your local shop call the distributor, Adventures
in Wine, (800) 870-9463.</LD>

<HD>DJs the Life of the Parties as 2002 Arrives</HD>
<DH>Major artists from the electronic scene enliven big events
in Hollywood and at the Coliseum that give Southern California some
New Year's revelry worthy of the name.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BALTIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just hours before he took the stage at Hollywood and Vine to help
L.A. ring in the new year, British deejay Paul Oakenfold talked about
the difficulty of finding the perfect song to play at midnight on New
Year's Eve.</LD>
<LD>   "I spent weeks trying to figure it out," Oakenfold confessed in a
backstage area. "But I finally found the song. It's not a dance song,
but it's by the first big [pop-rock] group to embrace dance music, so
it has the essence of dance music."</LD>
<LD>   A woman nearby guessed U2, which Oakenfold denied. However, after
actress Carmen Electra later led tens of thousands of partygoers in
the countdown to 2002, Oakenfold cued up the familiar intro to the
Irish band's "Where the Streets Have No Name."</LD>
<TE>   As fans celebrated the arrival of the new year by hugging, singing
along and throwing confetti, it was a magical moment not only for
those on hand but for others in a city that has been mocked for a
history of uninspired New Year's Eve celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts at mass New Year's Eve galas in L.A. have tended to be so
unfulfilling that they've been akin to taking your sister to the
prom. It's one way to attend the party, but you're probably better
off staying at home.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to an influx of major artists from the electronic music
scene and the growing perception that L.A. is fast becoming the new
world hot spot for dance music, New Year's Eve 2001 held the promise
of something more.</TE>
<TE>   While Oakenfold, Deep Dish, Jason Bentley, Sander Kleinenberg, BT
and others led the celebration at Spundae's Center of the Universe
event on Hollywood Boulevard that attracted some 30,000 fans over its
nine hours, organizers said, top-name deejays Sasha and Paul Van Dyk,
along with Jimmy Van M, Derrick Carter and more, had a capacity crowd
of some 12,500 dancing the night away in a spectacular domed setup a
few miles away on the grounds surrounding the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Backstage in the Coliseum area, Sasha wondered after his
trance-heavy three-hour set how many fans attended both parties. From
the looks of the differing crowds, the answer was not many.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Boulevard attracted an older audience, ranging from
people in their early 20s to those in their 50s and 60s, many of whom
were clearly there for the allure of being on the legendary street as
it was turned into a futuristic street fair, complete with food
vendors, green laser lights, booming stereo systems, giant video
screens and a Ferris wheel. Book-ended by stages at Cahuenga and
Vine, the event wove its way through side streets Cosmo, Ivar and
Selma as well.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Giant's Giant Village at the Coliseum grounds, which
had the feeling of a large club, brought in the rabid dance fans.
Mostly in their early to mid-20s, the ethnically diverse fans pushed
their way to the front of the stage, soaking in the awesome sound
system that deejays Sasha, Jimmy Van M and Lee Burridge lauded after
their sets.</TE>
<TE>   Those few fans, though, who did brave traffic between the two
events got a big payoff. If you planned it right, you could have seen
an unparalleled lineup of Oakenfold, Deep Dish, Sasha and Van Dyk.
While all performed expertly, there may be no better live deejay act
right now than Deep Dish.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington, D.C.-based duo, who earned attention through
remixing tracks for the likes of Madonna and 'N Sync, tore up the
boulevard with a three-hour mix of popular house tunes and big, airy,
keyboard-rich instrumentals.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks away, Oakenfold proved up to the challenge laid down
by Deep Dish. He surrounded his midnight selection of U2's song with
the larger-than-life grooves that have made him an international
sensation.</TE>
<TE>   At Coliseum Gardens, Sasha also displayed the masterful talent for
dramatic rises that has led him to be named No. 1 in the world
multiple times by the leading dance publications. On this night, he
skillfully worked the crowd into a continuous, fist-pumping frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   There aren't many deejays on the scene today that could follow
Sasha, but Germany's Paul Van Dyk is one of them. Fresh from Phoenix,
where he did a set earlier that night, Van Dyk didn't miss a beat as
he went straight into a fierce mix of spacey trance selections that
filled the dome from the packed-in front all the way back to the
grassy fields where weary dancers rested.</TE>
<TE>   Though it was the big names that attracted the most interest,
there were other quality performances turned in at the two venues,
including a furiously paced set of hard-core beats from Junkie XL and
a groovy blend of pop and techno from DJ Sneak.</TE>
<TE>   Still, no moment surpassed that of midnight. After viewing it from
the stage, Gene La Pietra, producer of the Center of the Universe
event, said the scene gave him chills--as well it should have.</TE>
<TE>   When U2 opened its concerts in 1987 with the uplifting, optimistic
"Where the Streets Have No Name," the band generated a sense of hope,
almost a dawning of an era musically and socially.</TE>
<TE>   Played by Oakenfold, the song again stirred those feelings. In the
shadow of Sept. 11, one sensed that the crowd didn't go to these
events just for world-class music but also for the hope to move on.</TE>

<HD>After 14 Years, Walsh Still on His Personal Crusade</HD>
<DH>Television* The 'America's Most Wanted' host relishes his
role as 'go-to guy' for citizens and the government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN BRANDON</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The scumbags and lowlifes, as John Walsh refers to them in his
rapid-fire staccato monotone, must have dreamed of a moment such as
this: Walsh, the force behind "America's Most Wanted," the Fox
television show turned cultural phenomenon that has helped capture
hundreds of fugitives, said he lay near death a few weeks ago in a
Florida hospital, a priest at his side administering the last rites.</LD>
<LD>   At that time, in mid-November, Walsh recounted in a recent
interview in Los Angeles, he was believed to have a case of
gastrointestinal anthrax, thought to be the result of a trip to the
Brentwood postal facility in Washington, D.C. Walsh had gone there at
the invitation of Postmaster General John Potter, who was announcing
a $1-million reward for the capture of the people responsible for the
anthrax attacks and had asked the "America's Most Wanted" operators
to take telephone tips on the case. Walsh's visit took place before
anyone realized the extent of the contamination that ultimately led
to the death of two of the site's workers.</LD>
<TE>   As Walsh lay in a Florida hospital's intensive care unit, his
blood pressure falling precipitously, he said, his thoughts were of
the absurdity of the situation. "You know, guys have tried to kill
me. I've been in motorcycle crashes. I've been washed away at sea
twice. People have shot at me, but I'm going to die from going to the
post office," he recalled thinking.</TE>
<TE>   It may have surprised Walsh's doctors, but few others, that Walsh,
whose dramatic personal history and flair for derring-do give him a
larger-than-life quality, survived that bleak November night. In
fact, he didn't have anthrax but cholera, contracted while in the
Middle East chasing terrorists, again by invitation. All par for the
course for a businessman who was turned into a crusader by personal
tragedy and who has helped change the laws of the land regarding
missing children; a savvy broadcaster with no media background who
founded one of television's longest-running shows, barely avoided
cancellation and now looks to branch into a daytime talk show; a
heartbroken father who first clashed with the FBI and then went on to
win the agency's highest civilian award, as well as kudos from all
levels of law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh today is the nation's "go-to guy," the man whom authorities
called after the bomb went off in Oklahoma City, the man the White
House called after the jets hit the World Trade Center towers and the
Pentagon. When the kidnapping of baby Jasmine Anderson from a Chicago
bus station became national news last week, Walsh was the expert CNN
put on the air to talk about child-abduction cases. (Police later
found the infant unharmed in West Virginia.) Three days after the
first "America's Most Wanted" show aired in 1988, its first featured
fugitive was caught, and the format has varied little since: File
footage, background data and dramatic reenactment highlight a case,
and viewers are asked to call the show's operators (not the
authorities) with tips. "Most Wanted" claims to have helped catch 689
criminals, 15 of them from the FBI's most wanted list.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the court of last resort," Walsh said. "We catch the
uncatchable. If you're ever really desperate to solve a case," he
says with pride and confidence, "you'll be calling me." In the wake
of the hunt for Osama bin Laden, who has been featured on "America's
Most Wanted" for years (as have other terrorists), the show seems to
have a renewed purpose. Larry King had Walsh on his show last
Thursday to talk about terrorists, with Walsh casually mentioning
that his program "is very big in Saudi Arabia."</TE>
<TE>   It may even, in some sense, have been a precursor of reality TV.
"There's no more reality and illusion anymore. People don't know
what's real and what's a metaphor," said Richard Walter, a professor
and screenwriting chairman in the department of film, television and
digital media at UCLA. "It's the real thing. It's reality, and it
isn't. It's a television presentation. People are fascinated by this.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely a voyeuristic experience," he added, calling it
"wonderfully involving" because the show calls on people to
participate in crime-solving. The show, now in its 14th season,
averages 9.4 million viewers on Saturday night (9 p.m., KTTV),
according to Nielsen figures, down from its peak in its second year,
when some 15 million viewers watched, but enough to make it one of
Fox's highest-rated programs. Only three other prime-time network
series ("60 Minutes," "20/20" and "Monday Night Football") have aired
longer.</TE>
<TE>   "'America's Most Wanted' is not just a job to me. It's a passion,"
Walsh said. "It's the way that I honor my son's memory. I learned
from the coroner who did Adam's autopsy. He said, 'You have free
will. ... Why don't you make sure your son didn't die in vain?' This
is not bragging: Myself and the American public and the people who
work on 'America's Most Wanted' are better than any cop in the
history of this country. We've caught more people. For me, that's a
legacy for Adam."</TE>
<TE>   Adam is Walsh's 6-year-old son, who was abducted from a Sears
store in Florida some 20 years ago and later beheaded. The trauma
turned Walsh, the partner in a hotel management company, into Walsh,
the crusader for victim's rights. And his audience's emotional ties
to the show helped Walsh survive another kind of near-death
experience when, in 1996, a reconfigured Fox briefly canceled his
show. "America's Most Wanted" was off the air for all of six weeks
before an army of protesters, including dozens of governors and
members of Congress, scores of law enforcement personnel and some
200,000 loyal, letter-writing fans, led the network to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh's unlikely television career also may be expanding. This
year he filmed the pilot for a daytime talk show on NBC that he only
half jokingly says could make him "the next Phil Donahue." Walsh, who
turned 56 last Wednesday, said he has talked about such a show for a
number of years but agreed to pursue it only if he could choose the
topics. The pilot, for example, was about the issue of child bullies,
he said, though he added that he wanted the show to include a wide
range of topics while not sinking into the titillation gutter that
bedevils daytime talk shows. According to NBC, the show is scheduled
to begin next fall in syndication.</TE>
<TE>   Talk Show Won't Stop</TE>
<TE>   Pursuit of Suspects</TE>
<TE>   Walsh said he has no intention of giving up "America's Most
Wanted" on Fox for the sake of a daytime talk show on NBC. And if
anyone can overcome the inherent obstacles of such a situation, he is
probably the one. After all, Walsh, and his wife, Reve, who had three
more children, now ages 7 to 19, after Adam's death, became tireless
reformers. In October 1982, 15 months after Adam's death, Congress
passed the Missing Children Act, which set up an FBI database of
missing children and empowers parents to report a case if local
police refuse.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, the couple founded the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children, a nonprofit center that is a resource for
parents, schools and law enforcement in missing children's cases. The
center has worked on more than 73,000 cases of missing and exploited
children and has helped to recover more than 48,000 children. It
maintains a toll-free hotline ([800] THE-LOST) to report a missing
child or the sighting of one.</TE>
<TE>   The Adam Walsh case became the catalyst for a movement. Abducted
children's faces began appearing on milk cartons, on pieces of direct
mail and on shopping bags. Eventually, tens of thousands of stores
across the nation adopted a system, dubbed "Code Adam," that was
created by Wal-Mart to give its employees standard procedures for
handling lost children and securing store exits to help reduce the
chance of an abductor getting away with a youngster.</TE>
<TE>   The family's heartache was dramatized in two television movies and
painfully chronicled in Walsh's best-selling 1997 memoir, "Tears of
Rage," the first of three books he has written. To this day, Walsh
alternately refers to himself as a "manhunter" and "the father of a
murdered child" in the flat monotone that is his signature. Walsh,
whose pleas to the FBI during his own son's case were ignored at the
time, went on to win the agency's highest civilian award. He has
testified before Congress more than 55 times and is an advocate for a
constitutional amendment for victims' rights.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the show couldn't solve his son's murder. The prime
suspect in the Adam Walsh case, a drifter named Ottis Toole, was
never charged. He died in prison while serving a life sentence for
other crimes and "took the truth to the grave with him," Walsh said.</TE>

<HD>A New Level of Comfort</HD>
<DH>Halle Berry once turned down film parts that didn't jibe
with her self-imposed image of 'role model.' Things have changed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARSHALL FINE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Other people's opinions: Actress Halle Berry doesn't live for them
anymore.</LD>
<LD>   And that, in a nutshell, is the answer to the nudity question.</LD>
<LD>   Berry is ensconced in a room in the fashion-forward Time Hotel in
midtown Manhattan, here to talk about "Monster's Ball," a tough film
about the unexpected relationship between a racist death row prison
guard (Billy Bob Thornton) and the widow of one of the black men he
has helped execute.</LD>
<TE>   There's plenty to discuss about this brooding, provocative
film--but Berry finds that all anyone (read: reporters) wants to talk
about is the film's steamy, progressively undressed love scene she
plays with Thornton in the film. Or her 42-second (according to a Web
site that measures such things) topless shot in last year's
"Swordfish." Or the fact that, after a decade in the movies, she
chose to take off her clothes at all.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of issues people are not asking about," she says
of the press' fascination with her nude scenes.</TE>
<TE>   On an unseasonably warm December day in Manhattan, Berry is a
vision in a bone-colored knit dress--but one gets the feeling she'd
be a vision in a sweatsuit after a 5-mile run. Her looks, she
maintains, are exactly the thing that have stood in her way of
playing roles such as Leticia Musgrove in "Monster's Ball," a part
she had to fight to get.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Berry has battled what she calls "the model image"
right from the start of her career, when she convinced Spike Lee she
could play a crack addict in "Jungle Fever" and again when she won
the right to play a woman who aged into her senior years in Alex
Haley's "Queen." But despite well-regarded acting turns in "Losing
Isaiah" and "Bulworth," she still struggles against the perception
that she's too beautiful to play a troubled character.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the thing I run up against: She's too pretty, she's the
face of Revlon," says Berry, 33, who won the Miss Teen All-American
Pageant in 1985, representing Ohio from her native Cleveland. "People
think that if you look this way, you can't be downtrodden. They have
this stereotyped image--and it's nice to challenge stereotypes. I've
had my fair share of ups and downs."</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of an African American father and a white mother who
divorced when she was 4, Berry battled for this role in a story about
the ways racial hatred is passed down from generation to
generation--and the ways it can be overcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Being the product of an interracial marriage, I've always known
the racial divide is insane and ridiculous," she says. "This film
speaks to the issue that people are racist because they are taught to
be. Those attitudes are passed down without meaning. The sad part is
that these people don't even understand why they believe what they
believe. But in this film, those beliefs get challenged."</TE>
<TE>   The film got a jump-start before it even opened, when the National
Board of Review named Berry and Thornton as best actress and actor of
the year. Berry subsequently was nominated for both a Golden Globe
and an American Film Institute Award as best actress. But she said
the NBR award, coming in early December, almost a month before the
film's opening, moved her to tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I had an out-of-body experience," she says. "This is an
independent movie that I thought would not get noticed in that way. I
just hoped that it would get other directors to see me differently.
What I hoped when I got the role was to get people talking, to draw
people to the theater to get the message. So the awards are a great
thing to happen to an independent movie. We hope they make people
curious enough to see the film."</TE>
<TE>   Even a couple of years ago, Berry would have read the "Monster's
Ball" script, gotten to the surprisingly explicit love scene--and
tossed the script aside.</TE>
<TE>   "All I'd have to hear was 'nude scene' and I'd say, 'Don't send me
that,'" she says. "I'm sure I passed up wonderful scripts that I
never read because I knew they required nudity."</TE>
<TE>   The reason: the fear of disappointing other people. Having been
class president and prom queen in high school (where she was also an
honor society member and editor of the school newspaper), Berry grew
up eager to please others. She found that, as her fame and visibility
increased, so did the hopes of people she didn't even know, whose
belief in her as a role model brought surprising pressure to bear on
Berry's psyche.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked hard to be what people wanted," she says. "I used to be
obsessed with wanting their approval, way back to my childhood.
Particularly the black community. So many black people would approach
me and say, 'My daughter aspires to be like you. Stay positive.' So
I'd try to stay that way.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that if I did nudity, I'd let them down and send the
wrong message to those girls. But then I realized it's not my job to
raise those girls."</TE>
<TE>   There were turning points that changed her perception of herself:
her very public divorce from baseball star David Justice (including
allegations that he abused her), her fulfillment of the dream to
produce and star in an HBO film about the late film star Dorothy
Dandridge (for which she won an Emmy and a Golden Globe).</TE>
<TE>   The watershed event, however, was the car accident on Feb. 23,
2000, that jeopardized Berry's career and made her the butt of
bad-driver jokes by late-night TV comics. Berry ultimately pleaded no
contest to a hit-and-run charge after she allegedly ran a red light
in her Chevy Blazer and struck another car. The other driver suffered
a broken wrist, as well as neck and back injuries; Berry, who
received 22 stitches for a gash in her forehead, reported the
accident to police at the hospital she drove to for treatment after
the accident. She was fined $13,500 and sentenced to 200 hours of
community service and settled out of court a civil suit filed by the
other driver.</TE>
<TE>   Berry says now that, in a strange way, the experience freed her
from worrying about what other people thought of her "because people
already thought the worst you could think about me--and my life went
on." She found that although she suffered a firestorm of publicity,
she emerged from the experience intact.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the start of me being released from that need to be
liked," she says. "Initially, it was all painful--the scariest thing
that ever happened to me. I was dealing with serious legal
uncertainty about my future. I couldn't speak out, so I had to risk
people thinking I was this terrible, evil person. And I was hearing
people make light of it on TV. It hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "As time went on, I got a thicker skin. People still make jokes
about it, but I'm not the first person to have a problem like
this--and I won't be the last. I had to learn who I was and not look
to other people to validate me. I couldn't allow the bad things the
press was saying about me to color how I felt about myself.</TE>
<TE>   "And now I'm more in control of who I am. I know who I am--and
that's what's important."</TE>
<TE>   Having been annealed in the media fires, all it took was a little
push from new husband Eric Benet for her to consider the roles in
"Swordfish" and "Monster's Ball."</TE>
<TE>   "I was so afraid of being exposed in that way," she says. "The
social milieu of this country is that nudity is wrong or bad.
Finally, with 'Swordfish,' my husband said, 'Why are you afraid of
this? Are you embarrassed about your body?' I said no. So he said,
'What's the problem?' When I told him people expected something
different from me, he said I should do what I wanted to do.</TE>
<TE>   "He also told me to look around our house. Every piece of art is
of the naked form. 'And you bought it all,' he said. And I realized I
was allowing what people thought of me to stop me.</TE>
<TE>   "So I decided I'm going to live for me. I'm going to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Which didn't stop rumors that Berry had balked at the "Swordfish"
nude scene and demanded an extra half-million dollars to do it
(untrue, she says). Those notions will be set aside by her heated
encounter with Thornton in "Monster's Ball," she believes.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a 21-day shoot--and we did that scene on Day 20," she
recalls. "So it was like we dated for three weeks first."</TE>
<TE>   That's considerably less time than she devoted to her relationship
with singer Benet before marrying him in January 2001. Berry, whose
four-year marriage to baseball star Justice (now of the Oakland A's)
ended in a 1996 divorce, was engaged to Benet for almost two years
before they tied the knot.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a reason the first marriage didn't work," she says. "But
I learned so much through the process about myself. I think this time
around I was better able to choose a better mate for myself. I
understand better what I need and was able to choose a partner who
was more compatible. Still, I was a little skeptical. We dated for
quite a while this time."</TE>
<TE>   Berry is waiting for shooting schedules on her next two films,
hoping that potential conflicts between overlapping productions of
"X-Men 2" and the next James Bond film (in which she's cast as the
villain) can be resolved so that she will be able to make both films.
While she's looking forward to a reunion with her "X-Men" cast mates
("I'm looking forward to us putting on the suits again"), the
opportunity to be a Bond villain plays right into her newfound urge
to explore previously off-limits aspects of her personality.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be great to play a bad girl," she says. "I've never done
that on film before. We can't be bad in life: You get in trouble and
go to jail. So it would be a thrill to do things in a surreal world,
with lots of fighting and bad-ass stuff. I don't do that in life."</TE>

<LD>Selected home-video releases: "The Music Business: An Insider's Guide
to Breaking In."</LD>
<LD>   This would seem like a late-night infomercial on DVD if not for
the big-name artists and execs who offer advice to budding musicians.</LD>
<LD>   The lineup includes Sting, Elton John, Sheryl Crow, Enrique
Iglesias, Rob Zombie, Barry Gibb, producer-record exec Jimmy Iovine
and Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun, among dozens of others in
the music business.</LD>
<TE>   There's plenty of practical--if fairly obvious--advice for
musicians or those interested in the support side of the industry:
the value of interning, understanding contracts and what companies
are looking for in a demo.</TE>
<TE>   The interviews are culled from an online music-industry primer
available at www.insidesessions.com, and the DVD sells exclusively on
that Web site. DVD, $24.95. (InsideSessions)</TE>
<TE>   Other new releases:</TE>
<TE>   "The Saint," sets 3-4--Roger Moore is back as suave, high-rolling
adventurer Simon Templar in the second batch of two-disc sets of the
1960s British TV series.</TE>
<TE>   Each set contains seven episodes, with bonuses including broadcast
trailers, production stills and a history of the "Saint" character.
DVD sets, $39.95 each. (A&amp;E)</TE>
<TE>   "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth
Dimension!"--A weird, fitfully funny film that's risen to cult status
since its 1984 release.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Weller plays the dimension-traveling, rock-and-rolling title
character, battling aliens and a mad scientist (John Lithgow) whose
plot threatens Earth. DVD, $19.98. (MGM)</TE>
<TE>   "Sound and Fury"--An absorbing Oscar-nominated documentary that
traces the turmoil for a deaf couple faced with opening up a new
world for their 5-year-old daughter with a revolutionary hearing
implant.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes extra interview footage not contained in the
theatrical release. DVD, $24.95. (Docurama)</TE>

<LD>Ask a jazz musician what they did on New Year's Eve and the most
likely response will be a quizzical look followed by "I worked; what
else?" That's because the ringing in of the new is the one night in
which, to paraphrase Garrison Keillor, the gigs abound, the joints
are crowded and the prices are above average.</LD>
<LD>   The arrival of 2002 was no exception, with rhythms swinging across
the Southland, from Fullerton's Steamers to Valley Glen's Charlie
O's.</LD>
<LD>   It would have taken a personal helicopter, in fact, to have fully
sampled the night's jazz wares, so my effort to survey the range of
sounds was limited to what the freeways would allow within a limited
time frame. And, remarkably, it was easier to move around town than I
anticipated.</LD>
<TE>   At 9:30 p.m., the first stop was the Jazz Bakery, where soul jazz
giant Les McCann was holding sway with his Nu Texas Savages. Seated,
Buddha-like, at center stage behind his electric piano, McCann mostly
devoted himself to the role of musical magistrate.</TE>
<TE>   Tossing in a few vocals, briefly punching out his patented riffs,
he kept the music cooking while allocating much of the solo space to
the talented young Savages trio--especially the stirring organ of
Bobby Sparks and the tenor saxophone of Keith Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   McCann does not have quite the keyboard proficiency he had before
his stroke in the mid-1990s, but he knows precisely where to place a
note for the greatest emotional impact.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that his irrepressible vocalizing on hits such as "Compared
to What" and "Cold Duck Time," and the Bakery's enthusiastic crowd
clearly experienced everything it needed for a soulful New Year's
celebration.</TE>
<TE>   At 10:30 p.m., after a trek north to Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, half a
block away from the busy sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard, it was a
distinct pleasure to step inside the club's warm, colorfully
decorated interior to experience the velvety sounds of singer Jane
Monheit. Viewed by many as the next breakout jazz vocalist, Monheit,
24, is still finding her way and establishing her style.</TE>
<TE>   However, her musical maturity can only be described as remarkable
and seems to improve with each new appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Monheit's growing improvisational skills and her capacity to vary
her melodic line without losing contact with her songs suggest that
she is ready to step into the spotlight. In her rendering of "Get Out
of Town," for example, a piece scheduled for inclusion on her new
album, the arrangement's effort to establish a jazz setting was
unnecessary; if anything it restricted her ability to soar.</TE>
<TE>   And when she wound up the evening with what has become a trademark
version of "Over the Rainbow" she further revealed her capacity to
new, transformative qualities in her interpretations. No wonder the
crowd responded with a standing ovation, enthusiastically waving
party hats and blowing noisemakers.</TE>
<TE>   Half an hour after 2002 rolled in, the Hollywood
Freeway--amazingly--was wide open. And at Spazio, Sherman Oaks, the
party was still going full blast. The attractions there were the
veteran tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards, singer Spanky Wilson and the
Tom Ranier Trio.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards and the trio romped through the twists and turns of the
bebop world, oblivious to the crowd's animated conversations, with
Ranier and Edwards delivering impressive solos. But it remained for
Wilson to pull the audience back into the music--and onto the dance
floor--with a dazzling version of "Ain't Misbehavin'."</TE>
<TE>   Adding a final coda to the evening, as well as the New Year's jazz
journey, Edwards and the Ranier Trio followed with an appropriate
closing number, the old Nat "King" Cole classic, "That's All."</TE>

<HD>Leadership Shifts in the Land of Nielsen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High in a tower, a group of wizards spins mysterious spells, their
alchemy governing the fate of a kingdom and its minions.</LD>
<LD>   But enough about Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   From a commercial and perhaps even cultural perspective, few
enterprises may be more influential, and less understood, than
Nielsen, which provides the television ratings that networks and
media buyers rely upon to negotiate advertising rates. Beyond
governing more than $50 billion in annual spending on TV ads, the
information serves as a cultural touchstone, a tool people use to
gauge the prevailing public mood and tastes.</LD>
<TE>   That dynamic alone would be reason to take note of a change within
the castle, as Susan D. Whiting became president and chief executive
of the ratings service effective Tuesday, succeeding John Dimling,
who is retiring.</TE>
<TE>   Whiting, 45, has spent her entire career at Nielsen, having
started in the company's management development program in 1978 after
graduating from Denison University with a degree in economics. Still,
she takes the helm at a time when Nielsen (acquired by Dutch media
giant VNU in 1999) faces enormous challenges, as researchers grapple
with how best to estimate viewing patterns in a world populated by
hundreds of channels, viewed and distributed in an ever-changing
variety of ways.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, by the way, the word is "estimate," which, despite the
high stakes, is all Nielsen or similar research firms can profess to
do. In this case, the service employs samples of several thousand to
estimate TV viewing in more than 105 million U.S. homes with
television, both on a national basis and in 210 individually rated
cities across the U.S., from New York to tiny Glendive, Mont.</TE>
<TE>   On a national level, viewing is monitored by "people meters,"
introduced in the 1980s, which offer detailed next-day information
along various demographic lines, recording viewing by every member in
a household.</TE>
<TE>   Intricate as the system is, it is not without shortcomings. The
networks themselves, at various times, have griped about the validity
of the Nielsen sample (many people pass at the opportunity) and its
failure to count such things as out-of-home viewing in bars, offices
and hotel rooms, potentially punishing franchises ranging from
"Monday Night Football" to daytime soaps to CNN and the Weather
Channel.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such complaints, Nielsen, founded in 1923, has endured as
TV's primary ratings source for more than four decades, weathering
challenges from competitors to maintain a virtual monopoly. "The
agencies, the networks, the stations and the producers live and die
by those figures," said Harold Simpson, vice president of research
for the Television Bureau of Advertising, or TVB, which, like
Nielsen, is based in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Whiting, situated more than 20 floors above Park Avenue, is
undaunted by the fact Nielsen is invariably perceived as a bad guy or
a punch line, an insidious force that can't possibly get it right.
Fans of canceled series fill Web sites insisting Nielsen doesn't
approximate their tastes, just as disgruntled producers are
occasionally heard muttering, "Well, everyone I know was watching the
show. ... "</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more than anything, however, people are curious. Often,
when she meets people, Whiting said, "their first question is, 'How
do you do that?' You spend a lot of your time describing how we do
what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen's methodology runs the gamut from high-tech (wiring
people's homes) to low, which includes mailing out "diaries" that ask
individuals to report their own viewing habits. More recently, the
company has joined with Arbitron, which provides radio ratings, to
test a "portable people meter," a device about the size of pager that
detects identification codes embedded in TV or radio programs. Data
are downloaded at the end of each day.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary tests of the Arbitron system have revealed increased
use levels for TV and radio, with another round to begin in
Philadelphia this month. New cable set-top box technology, as well as
such personal video recorders as TiVo, also present opportunities to
gather data directly from consumers, though Whiting pointed out that
such information's value must be balanced against the fact that the
relatively few people who own such devices aren't representative of
the population at large. In order to be valid, the sample must be
randomly chosen, with everyone having an equal chance to be asked.</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen's biggest problem, historically, has been getting people
to participate--either to fill out diaries or become "Nielsen
families" for anywhere from two years (at the national level) to up
to five years for local markets.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important part of the process is getting the right
homes, getting people to cooperate," Whiting said.</TE>
<TE>   Other limitations are financial. For example, Whiting noted,
discussion of methodology to measure viewing in college dorms and
vacation homes (the former, in particular, would be good news to
shows such as "Late Night With Conan O'Brien" or "The Daily Show With
Jon Stewart") has temporarily been deemed cost-prohibitive due to a
downturn in the advertising market.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the entertainment and advertising industries have both
consolidated, so Nielsen finds itself dealing with fewer companies.
The push and pull among those massive media conglomerates will
determine the kind of information Nielsen collects.</TE>
<TE>   "The data exist minute to minute," Whiting said. "Our clients have
to help to decide what it is they want us to report."</TE>
<TE>   Whiting stresses that Nielsen data are "extremely reliable and
very accurate" and that the service must remain open to new alliances
and technology that will augment its data. As it is, listening to the
way Nielsen goes about measuring the viewing patterns of 270 million
U.S. residents brings to mind Winston Churchill's comment about
democracy--namely, that it is the worst system of government ever
invented, except for all the others.</TE>
<TE>   Such disclaimers aside, Nielsen ratings are generally reported as
gospel, to the extent that adults actually find themselves quibbling
over hundredths of rating points--as evidenced by the amusing
spectacle that followed the November sweeps, when NBC and Fox split
hairs over who finished first among adults age 18 to 49, the most
important category to advertisers and networks.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, if the system requires suspension of disbelief--a need
to have faith that the No. 23 show did, indeed, beat out the No. 24
show when the situation might actually have been reversed--consider
that part of the magic denizens of Nielsen's kingdom have come to
accept.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody pays attention to the small print," said Ave Butensky, a
veteran TV executive and former head of the TVB, conceding that
ratings are not an exact science. Still, he added, "if there were no
Nielsen, I don't know what kind of mayhem you'd have."</TE>

<HD>'Mill Times': A Whirlwind Tour</HD>

<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Behemoth waterwheels, the driving force behind revolutionary
textile-producing machines, began altering the landscape of American
river towns in the late 1790s, and American life would never be the
same. It's a big story, and if you missed it in school, the much
lauded "How Things Work" guru, author and illustrator David Macaulay
will explain it all in tonight's PBS family-friendly documentary
"Mill Times."</LD>
<LD>   Based on Macaulay's book "Mill," it's an amiable mix of animated
storytelling and live action, with a cheerleading tone somewhat
reminiscent of fifth-grade educational films. Its skew toward younger
viewers is evident in fictionalized and personalized cartoon segments
about one early mill's rise and fall--with a mild love story thrown
in.</LD>
<LD>   But, while some segments are schoolbookish, the computer-animated
mills and New England locales are impressively detailed and visually
striking. And Macaulay--whose painstakingly researched books for
children and adults offer clear and conversational explanations of
the history and technology of everything from Egyptian pyramids to
air bags and the Internet--is a likable tour guide through a
show-and-tell of mills and machines of the period, from small
spinning wheels to clacking, whirring industrial looms.</LD>

<HD>Disney's Purchase of Baby Einstein Seen as Intelligent Move</HD>
<DH>Video: Homespun company's line of educational products for
infants and young children complements those of the entertainment
giant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONE TREE, Colo.</DL>
<LD>In the corner suite of a two-story office building in suburbia, the
imagination of Baby Einstein founder Julie Aigner-Clark runs wild.</LD>
<LD>   She giggles as she winds up toy chicks that hop across a makeshift
stage in a warehouse filled with dolls and puppets.</LD>
<LD>   The chicks' jerky movements become a dance to the staccato pace of
the "William Tell" Overture on a video. In another, Aigner-Clark
reads poems that are dubbed over scenes of twirling tops and painting
puppets. In a third, characters bob to alphabet chants in several
languages.</LD>
<TE>   Baby Einstein educational videos are designed to teach infants and
young children human expression, including language, art and music,
as well as concepts. They've caught the attention of Walt Disney Co.,
which purchased the homespun business in November for an undisclosed
amount.</TE>
<TE>   Media analyst David Miller of Sutro &amp; Co. said the two companies
complement each other. "It's family-oriented, educational, and that
really is the Disney brand right there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aigner-Clark, 35, graduated from Michigan State University with a
major in English and moved to New Jersey to teach middle school and
high school.</TE>
<TE>   When she quit her job to be a stay-at-home mom for her first
daughter, Aigner-Clark found her hectic life left her little time to
herself. She came up with the idea of a video to occupy her infant
while she made a phone call or took a shower.</TE>
<TE>   While living in Atlanta in 1997, she cobbled together the first
video, "Baby Einstein," in her basement using personal savings and a
producer she found in the Yellow Pages.</TE>
<TE>   "It was literally me pushing 'play' on the Beta Cam and dragging a
cat across a table with fishing line,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   She first pitched "Baby Einstein" to CNN. The basement-produced
video soon was selling in Japan via CNN's Web site and at Right
Start, a chain of specialty toy stores.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, customers clamoring for more convinced Aigner-Clark
to produce a second video called "Baby Mozart," later adding "Baby
Bach," "Baby Shakespeare" and "Baby Van Gogh."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Bill Clark, was working for a Michigan-based company
designing elementary school science curricula before he began helping
with the financial aspects of Baby Einstein.</TE>
<TE>   Video sales hit $100,000 in the first year, and the company grew
by more than 4,000% in less than three years.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Baby Einstein sales topped $11 million; projected revenue
for 2001 is $17 million.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the collection includes seven videos, DVDs, flashcards,
toys and board books. To date, more than 3 million items have sold.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I just hit on an idea that nobody had come up with, or
they didn't know how to do it," Aigner-Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   Baby Einstein will remain a separate brand, said Disney spokesman
Russell Hampton, who will become Baby Einstein's manager.</TE>
<TE>   Disney plans to create a Little Einstein series targeting 2- to
5-year-olds as well as a daily TV show and more board books, he said.
Disney plans to retain Aigner-Clark and her husband as consultants.</TE>

<LD>India and Pakistan appeared to be backing away from full-scale war as
the new year began, and that was good news for world markets on many
fronts.</LD>
<LD>   Now that the two countries have nuclear weapons, any new conflict
comparable to India and Pakistan's 1965 war over disputed Kashmir
could send financial markets worldwide into a tailspin.</LD>
<LD>   Also, the conflict interrupts progress for both countries. India
and Pakistan have moved in recent years to reform their economies to
create opportunities for their people and for foreign investment.</LD>
<TE>   "Despite current tensions, both countries realize the danger and
will resolve the current dispute diplomatically," says Safi Qureshey,
a Pakistani-born Orange County  entrepreneur.</TE>
<TE>   Qureshey, who returned from a trip to Pakistan on New Year's Eve,
reports that business contacts between the two countries are growing,
particularly in high-tech industries. "In every city in Pakistan you
see Internet companies developing. And many of the companies are
extensions of India's successful software firms," says Qureshey,
whose latest venture is Avaz Networks, a semiconductor and
communications-software firm located in Pakistan and Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The potential is great for further economic cooperation. Pakistan
has oil and natural gas deposits, which it is now developing, and
electrical energy that it could supply to power-short India if
tensions eased.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Futile Hostilities'</TE>
<TE>   Of course the potential is enormous for both countries,
particularly if India and Pakistan could devote their energies to
building modern economies instead of war machines. Neither country
can afford what Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee termed
"futile hostilities" in a statement Monday.</TE>
<TE>   India, despite a large middle-class population and high-tech
abilities, remains one of the largest underdeveloped economies on
Earth. India's population, at 1.1 billion, is 10 times larger than
that of Mexico, yet India's economic output--gross domestic
product--is only comparable to that of Mexico at about $500 billion.</TE>
<TE>   India, though a democracy, ranks way behind Communist-</TE>
<TE>   ruled China in attracting business investment.</TE>
<TE>   But then China began to open its economy in 1978 under the late
leader Deng Xiaoping; India and Pakistan started to privatize state
industries and open to foreign investment only in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Burdened With Debt</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan, at 142 million people--small by the standards of
populous Asia--has only $65 billion in annual economic output, yet is
saddled with $40 billion of debt to other nations.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its support in the war on terrorism, Pakistan is
getting relief on some of those debts and will receive U.S. aid
totaling about $1 billion. Also, Pakistan is undergoing a $6-billion
privatization of its state industries, including banking and electric
power, says Shezad Rokerya, chairman of Interlink Co., a Los Angeles
investment firm buying banking companies in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has a big stake in the peaceful development of
both countries because they are strategic for all of Asia and because
U.S. economic ties have grown in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Indian and Pakistani entrepreneurs have built dozens of U.S.
companies in the last decade. And U.S. investment, particularly to
India, has grown to more than $1 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. companies now rely on India for about $700 million in
information services annually, ranging from computer software by
programming companies in Bangalore in southern India to engineering
services and biotechnology research by Indian companies and
institutes.</TE>
<TE>   Also, India is becoming a center for back-office services, in
which Indian employees handle customer-service calls by phone and the
Internet for Amazon.com and other firms in the United States and
other countries. Such jobs are low-paid, but they represent an
advance from subsistence village agriculture for thousands of Indian
youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   So some trends are positive. What steps must India and Pakistan
take to increase economic growth? And how can the U.S. help most
effectively?</TE>
<TE>   First, it is imperative that both countries increase the education
levels of their young populations.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan needs to build schools and educate more teachers for the
schools it has, says Mehnaz Akber, an education specialist working
with development institutes in Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   "Distance learning through the Internet could do much to improve
education in a country lacking school buildings," entrepreneur
Qureshey says.</TE>
<TE>   India boasts a proficient higher education system, key to the
success of Bangalore software firms such as Wipro Ltd. and Infosys
Technologies Ltd. But it needs to pay greater attention to primary
and secondary education, says C. Chris Fair, a South Asian expert at
Rand Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Only 49% of India's school-age population attends high school (and
36% of Pakistan's), compared with 70% of China's youngsters and 64%
of Mexico's. That's a significant weakness for a country offering

<TE>   And both nations would help their economies if they could reduce
their heavy expenditures on defense. Pakistan, ruled by its military,
spends 24% of its government budget on defense. India devotes 19% of
its budget to the military. More funds would be available for social
and educational purposes if those defense budgets could be cut.</TE>
<TE>   And more economic cooperation on tourism, energy and high-tech
industries could help bring that about.</TE>
<TE>   Qureshey visited Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, on
his latest trip and says, "The United States can help ease tensions,
mostly working behind the scenes." Presumably, we could be doing just
that in the new year's easing of tensions.</TE>

<HD>Major Foreign Markets Feel Full Effect of Global Economic
Woes</HD>
<DH>Although some smaller nations' equities rose strongly,
results in the biggest countries were poor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors who got really exotic in their foreign stock picking last
year had a chance to reap some spectacular gains.</LD>
<LD>   Zimbabwe, China, Sri Lanka and Kuwait were standout performers
among global equity markets in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   But those investors who stayed with mainstream foreign markets in
Europe and Asia suffered losses that were generally worse than what
they would have endured in the U.S. market.</LD>
<TE>   That means 2001 was the fifth year in the last six that American
investors, on average, were better off keeping their money at home
than in foreign markets.</TE>
<TE>   The average international stock mutual fund sank about 19% in
2001, according to preliminary data from fund tracker Morningstar
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the average domestic stock fund fell about 12% last
year, Morningstar data show.</TE>
<TE>   The main weights on foreign markets last year were the same as on
the U.S. market: a continued decline of the once-hot technology
sector and a plunge in corporate profits overall as the global
economy skidded into recession.</TE>
<TE>   But Americans investing overseas also had to contend with the
downside of the robust dollar: The U.S. currency's strength was a
boon for anyone traveling abroad, but it deepened foreign market
losses when those shares' values were translated from weaker
currencies into dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Among principal markets, Japan was the worst performer in 2001,
reflecting widespread belief that its economy is the sickest of all
major economies.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Nikkei-225 index fell 23.5% in yen for the year,
according to Bloomberg News data. That far exceeded the 13% drop in
the U.S. blue-chip benchmark, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. The Nikkei's
decline also was worse than the 21.1% drop in the Nasdaq composite
index.</TE>
<TE>   The yen's plunge against the dollar left a U.S. investor holding a
basket of Nikkei-225 stocks with a net loss of 33.5% for the year,
Bloomberg News data show. It took 131.62 yen to buy one dollar as of
Monday, versus 114.4 a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The yen's drop against the dollar in 2001 was the biggest
calendar-year decline since 1989, Bloomberg News calculated.</TE>
<TE>   The euro currency also lost value against the dollar in 2001, but
the euro's slide was much more moderate. One euro was worth 89 U.S.
cents at year-end, down from 94 cents at the end of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Bloomberg European 500 index, measuring Europe's 500 largest
stocks by market capitalization (stock prices times the total number
of shares outstanding) dropped about 15% last year, slightly worse
than the U.S. S&amp;P 500. But in dollar terms the European 500 was off
nearly 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Among individual European markets, France, Italy and the
Netherlands saw their key indexes lose more than 20% for the year in
euro terms. The Spanish market held up better, as the IBEX-35 eased
about 8%.</TE>
<TE>   The British market's blue-chip index, the FTSE-100, fell 16.2% for
the year in pounds, and 18.3% in dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Because many U.S.-based foreign-stock mutual funds are heavily
invested in European and Japanese shares, the performance of those
markets was the principal determinant of the funds' performance for
the year--and will be the key to how they fare in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Brokerage Morgan Stanley, in its 2002 outlook report to clients,
says major European stocks are priced about on par with U.S. shares,
at about 20 times estimated 2002 earnings per share.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anticipated Returns for European Markets</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley strategist Richard Davidson predicts that European
markets overall will produce returns of 5% to 8% this year, assuming
the European economy revives in tandem with the expected U.S.
recovery. The brokerage recently boosted European holdings in its
recommended global portfolio allocation while paring its stake in
Japanese stocks.</TE>
<TE>   For beleaguered Japan, the central question is whether the
government of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi can push through
policy reforms that ultimately could reinvigorate that economy, said
Morgan Stanley strategist Robert Alan Feldman. Those reforms include
forcing banks to write off more bad loans, and changing the tax
structure to enhance the economy's efficiency, Feldman said.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. strategist Masatoshi Kikuchi says the outlook
for Japan's economy and market depends on "a strong economic rebound
in the United States, a recovery in the information technology
sector, and a regaining of investors' confidence in restructuring by
Japanese companies."</TE>
<TE>   The dollar, as always, remains the wild card: If it continues to
rise in value against the yen and other currencies, any gains
achieved in foreign markets will be lessened for U.S. investors in
those markets. The flip side is that if the dollar weakens it would
automatically add to any foreign-market gains.</TE>
<TE>   One potentially positive sign from the Japanese market in 2001 was
that smaller stocks held up much better than larger stocks--mirroring
the split U.S. market. Japan's Nikkei-OTC share index of mostly
smaller stocks fell 8.4% in yen last year, about one-third the loss
of the Nikkei-225.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, the S&amp;P small-cap stock index rose 5.7% last year.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller stocks generally are considered riskier than bigger names,
but that didn't pan out in 2001. Likewise, many emerging markets
overseas shined in 2001 even as bigger markets slumped.</TE>
<TE>   In Asia, South Korea's main share index soared 37.5% for the year,
boosted in part by optimism that higher government spending, along
with tax cuts, will spur the economy in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   In Taiwan the main index gained 17.1% last year, powered by
technology stocks as investors bet the companies will benefit from a
turnaround in the global economy.</TE>
<TE>   In Latin America, Argentina's market crumbled in anticipation of
the country's debt default. But there was little collateral damage
across the region. Indeed, Mexico's main share index added 12.7% for
the year, and was even stronger in dollar terms as the peso rose.</TE>
<TE>   The hottest markets of 2001 were those where most investors
generally fear to tread.</TE>
<TE>   Zimbabwe's main share index rocketed more than 157% for the year,
despite mounting political violence in the African nation. But the
market's gain in part reflected an inflation rate running at about
100%, and interest rates above 70%.</TE>
<TE>   China's B-share indexes in Shanghai and Shenzhen were up more than
90% for the year. Those shares had been limited to foreign investors
until last year, when domestic investors were allowed to buy them.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's market, long viewed as a casino by foreign investors,
also produced an outsized gain of 91.4%.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, the average emerging-markets stock mutual fund fell
about 7% in 2001, preliminary Morningstar data found. That was a far
better performance than in 2000, when the average emerging-markets
fund tumbled 31%.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts argue that if investors are betting on an economic
recovery this year, emerging markets still have the best
potential--for those who are willing to accept the (usually) greater
risk involved.</TE>

<HD>IBM Finds New Profit in Recycling Old Computers</HD>
<DH>Technology: As leasing increases, company boosts earnings
by giving second life to used PCs, selling returned items on the Web
or stripping them for their parts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL HORVITZ</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. is wringing new profit from old goods by refurbishing
leased computers or cannibalizing them for parts when they're turned
in.</LD>
<LD>   At a hangar-like facility near Raleigh, N.C., truckloads of used
personal computers, laptops and servers pour onto conveyor belts and
forklifts. The swift, automated process resembles manufacturing in
reverse, the aim being to extract value rather than build it in. The
refurbished machines and used parts are sold on auction Web sites and
to brokers.</LD>
<LD>   IBM, the biggest computer maker, wants to extend the
income-producing life of its products and increase its lease
program's share of total sales. IBM can offer new equipment on more
attractive leasing terms because the company will squeeze more value
from a device after it's returned, said Joseph Lane, who oversees
IBM's leasing and recovery businesses.</LD>
<TE>   "It would be my preference that nobody buy from us; I'd rather
have them leasing," said Lane, general manager of IBM Global
Financing. "Of the hardware we move into the marketplace, we finance
over one-third of it, and the percentage is growing."</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, leases increased to 35% of all hardware sales, from 30%
at the end of 2000, Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM said. Global Financing's
contribution to third-quarter profit rose to 14% in 2001 from 10% a
year earlier. The division produced about 4% of IBM's sales in both
periods.</TE>
<TE>   The recycling business has a wider profit margin than the leasing
side, Lane said. Together, the two businesses had a third-quarter
gross profit margin--the percentage of sales left after deducting
production costs--of 51%. Pretax income rose to $314 million from
$294 million in the year-ago period.</TE>
<TE>   IBM has been promoting leasing in more of its sales pitches, he
added. If a potential client balks at prices for new or leased units,
the company can strike a bargain on refurbished equipment to keep the
customer away from rivals. The company's Global Asset Recovery System
collects an average of 10,000 pieces of leased equipment a week at
recovery centers in the U.S., including Raleigh and Endicott, N.Y.,
as well as in Japan, France, Germany and Australia. Besides
computers, the gear includes monitors, printers, data-storage devices
and network routers and switches.</TE>
<TE>   "They do have the capability and certainly the volume to have
economies of scale," Gartner Group Inc. analyst Frances O'Brien said.</TE>
<TE>   As long as used computers can run the software required, they can
be attractive to companies eager to squeeze as much as they can from
their assets or those unable to make big capital expenditures. Demand
is strong in Eastern Europe, for example, said Yankee Group analyst
Jon Derome.</TE>
<TE>   "The prices of refurbished computers are not rock bottom," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tons of outdated computers sit idle in the U.S., and many
companies store them rather than face the complex task of
environmentally safe disposal, O'Brien said. IBM has "a tremendous
opportunity" in recycling such equipment, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Personal-computer makers Dell Computer Corp. and Compaq Computer
Corp. take used units but not on the scale of IBM's operation,
O'Brien said, adding that they don't strip units for parts.</TE>
<TE>   IBM also may benefit if computer recycling becomes mandatory in
the U.S., as it is in Germany, O'Brien said. Japan's mandatory PC
recycling law takes effect this year.</TE>
<TE>   This month IBM plans to announce a yet-to-be-named service for
recovering more used gear that was sold, not leased, Lane said. IBM
can take computers on consignment so the profit can be shared with
the seller, he said. IBM saves tens of millions of dollars a year by
plucking used spare parts for its computers, Lane said.</TE>
<TE>   IBM tries to keep the turnaround time and labor costs of
refurbishing used computers low. In Raleigh, bar codes on each item
and supply-chain software let IBM automate tracking. Software is used
to confirm a computer's internal configuration, erase all old data
and test refurbished units.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the process, "optimization" software helps IBM decide at
what price to sell used machines and parts, based on market
conditions and the products' conditions.</TE>
<TE>   After stripping usable parts and recycling glass, metals and
plastics, IBM discards about 4% of what it collects, Lane said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, about $100 million in sales of used goods came through
IBM's auction Web site, which is limited to screened buyers. That
level probably doubled in 2001, Lane said. This month, a catalog of
fixed-price items will be added to this site, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other fixed-price sales to consumers come on IBM's open Web site,
and the firm has an arrangement to auction PCs on EBay.</TE>
<TE>   IBM shares closed Monday at $120.96, down $1.94 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>A Not-So-Bad Year for Some Investors Despite Broad Decline</HD>
<DH>In 2001, smaller stocks performed better than larger
issues. Meanwhile, 'value' sector surpassed 'growth' overall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Measured by most broad indexes, the U.S. stock market was a loser in
2001 for a second consecutive year.</LD>
<LD>   But under the surface, the market was a relatively hospitable
place for many investors, depending on how they picked their stocks.</LD>
<LD>   For a second straight year, smaller-company stocks generally were
better choices than bigger ones, a trend that continued with the
powerful fourth-quarter rally that lifted the market overall from the
three-year lows reached after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Also, "value" stocks generally performed better than "growth"
issues, repeating the trend of 2000. But as investors in recent
months began to look toward an economic recovery in 2002, growth
stocks returned to prominence--boosting hopes that the longest and
deepest bear market since 1973-74 had run its course.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, technology stocks roared back in the fourth quarter,
lifting the Nasdaq composite index 30% in the period. Still, the
severity of tech shares' losses earlier in the year left the Nasdaq
index down 21.1% for 2001, after a 39.3% plunge in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 10.3% in the fourth
quarter, paring its loss for the year to 13%. The index lost 10.1% in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the slide in the S&amp;P index last year, more than 40% of the
index's 500 stocks rose in price, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange overall, 2,216 issues advanced last
year while 1,415 fell, according to Associated Press data. However,
the winners' list on the NYSE is skewed by gains in high-dividend
preferred stocks, which tend to perform more in line with bonds
(meaning they do well when interest rates fall.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, it may surprise many investors that more stocks rose than
fell even on Nasdaq for the year: Winners topped losers by 2,289 to
2,064, according to AP data.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, 2001 could have been a very good year for stock
pickers who picked well. A bet on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts a year ago,
for example, yielded a 113% gain as the doughnut retailer continued
its national expansion. Strong earnings at auto parts retailer
AutoZone drove its shares up 152% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors who played financially troubled companies also
wound up with handsome payoffs. Xerox jumped 125% for the year as
investors bet the company will avoid collapse.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For Many Investors, Losers Swamp Winners</TE>
<TE>   But deft stock picking always is tougher than it appears. And the
cold reality for most investors with a diversified portfolio of
stocks is that the losers in 2001 more than likely swamped the
winners.</TE>
<TE>   The average domestic stock mutual fund lost about 12% last year,
according to preliminary data from fund tracker Morningstar Inc. It
could have been much worse without the fourth-quarter rally that
lifted the average fund about 14%.</TE>
<TE>   The central question on Wall Street, of course, is whether the
bear market that began in March 2000 has ended. Optimists are in the
majority among market professionals, based primarily on their belief
that an economic recovery--and a rebound in depressed corporate
earnings--is a certainty in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   In a 2002 outlook for clients, investment company Citigroup argues
that "policy will beat fear"--references to the interest rate policy
of the Federal Reserve and the fiscal policy of the Bush
administration, versus the continuing fear of a deeper U.S. recession
and the potential for more terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "In the absence of a major shock, policy stimulus is likely to
overcome recessionary forces" in 2002, the company said. That appears
to be happening already: A slew of economic indicators over the last
month have pointed to recovery.</TE>
<TE>   But many investors understandably remain wary. Despite the strong
rally of recent months, the stock market isn't playing along with the
historical script when it comes to Fed interest rate cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed began its campaign to ease credit Jan. 3, when it cut its
benchmark short-term interest rate to 6% from 6.5%. The central bank
cut that rate 10 more times in 2001, to the current 40-year low of
1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   In 13 previous periods since 1971 when the Fed was aggressively
cutting rates, the S&amp;P 500 index was higher 12 months after the first
cut, with one exception (in 1976).</TE>
<TE>   This time, the S&amp;P still is down 10.5% since the Fed's first cut
of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Why hasn't the market responded as usual? Michael Murphy, editor
of the California Technology Stock Letter in Half Moon Bay, Calif.,
believes that "the lag between the business slowdown [which began in
2000] and the consumer slowdown has made this bear market unusually
long."</TE>
<TE>   But that's also the good news, he contends: "It also has meant
that a lot of the bloodletting [in the stock market] was done before
the economy actually entered a recession."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts, however, warn that the debt-burdened economy may
find it much more difficult to turn around in 2002 than the optimists
submit.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been an odd recession, so its future may also be
unconventional," said A. Gary Shilling, head of an economic
consulting firm that bears his name. The recession will deepen this
year as more consumers rein in their spending, he predicts.</TE>
<TE>   If Shilling is right, a rebound in corporate earnings may not
happen in 2002, in which case many investors could well sour anew on
stocks--especially given that price-to-earnings ratios of many stocks
remain above average, even based on the improved profits expected
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the market's trend in 2001 showed that some sectors can
shine even when broad stock indexes decline.</TE>

<TE>   What 2001 Trends Can Mean for 2002</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at two of the main themes that were evident in 2001
and what that might portend for 2002:</TE>
<TE>   * Smaller stocks versus bigger stocks. The S&amp;P index of 600
smaller stocks gained 5.7% last year while blue-chip indexes slumped.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the S&amp;P index of 400 mid-size stocks performed better
than blue-chip indexes, losing a modest 1.6%.</TE>
<TE>   The trend of smaller stocks beating blue chips began in 2000, when
the S&amp;P small-stock index rose 11% and the mid-size stock index
jumped 16.2%, even as the S&amp;P 500 fell 10.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Why bet on smaller companies? One argument has been that smaller
stocks were unloved for so long in the late 1990s that they became
extremely cheap when measured by such yardsticks as price-to-earnings
ratios. Brokerage firm Goldman Sachs Group, in a December report to
clients, made the case that smaller stocks' favorable performance
should continue in 2002 in part because of "more appealing"
valuations than larger stocks show.</TE>
<TE>   Another argument by investors who favor smaller stocks is that the
companies can be more nimble than bigger firms in a difficult
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Satya Pradhuman, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst who focuses on
smaller shares, notes that these stocks typically perform much better
than the broader market in January--the so-called January effect on
Wall Street. If that effect occurs again this month, it could
encourage more investors to shift capital from blue chips to smaller
names.</TE>
<TE>   * Value stocks versus growth stocks. The "value" label typically
is ascribed to stocks that sell for lower-than-average
price-to-earnings ratios or that offer higher-than-average dividend
yields, or both.</TE>
<TE>   Value shares began to attract more investors in 2000 as the
highflying growth sector (led by tech shares) collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, value still fared better than growth overall: The average
mutual fund that focuses on large value stocks fell about 6% last
year, while the average fund that focuses on large growth stocks
tumbled 24%, according to preliminary data from Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   But as hopes for an economic recovery surged in the fourth
quarter, growth stocks revived. Now, investors who are betting on a
strong economic rebound by mid-year would be smartest to bet on
growth shares, particularly technology names, many Wall Street pros
say.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy argues that the earnings potential of many tech firms in
software and semiconductors could be higher than analysts expect if
the economy rebounds, thanks to sharp cost-cutting by the companies
and market-share gains as weaker rivals have disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Other classic growth sectors include health care and retailing.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, classic value sectors include such areas as energy,
heavy industry and banking.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts are telling investors that the best strategy in
2002, and perhaps in any year, is to own shares in both growth and
value sectors rather than choose one style only.</TE>
<TE>   Given the uncertainty over the pace of any economic rebound, and
the gains in many shares since Sept. 21, "style agnosticism is
warranted in 2002," said market strategist Steve Galbraith at Morgan
Stanley in New York. "Portfolios should maintain exposure to both
sides of the aisle."</TE>

<HD>Mexico Rejects Telephone Tax</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Mexico's Senate defeated a proposal to levy a 10% tax on local and
national long-distance telephone calls, arguing the surcharge would
make it harder for poor and middle-class Mexicans to afford phone
service.</LD>
<LD>   The 57-54 vote on specific articles of a law previously passed to
tax some phone services, soft drinks, liquor and cigarettes deprives
the government of about $817 million in extra revenue this year. The
10% tax still applies to contract cellular telephone service and to
cellular calls made on certain pre-paid cards. "To tax
telecommunications would scare away national and foreign investment,
and would impede a growing number of Mexicans from access to
telephone services," said Sen. Eric Rubio Barthell, from the
Institutional Revolutionary Party.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate's decision to reject the tax on phone services may help
boost shares of Telefonos de Mexico, the country's largest phone
company, when markets open after the New Year's holiday.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>More than 100,000 television viewers can no longer watch NBC programs
after the network cut ties with a local station that emitted stronger
signals than its new affiliate.</LD>
<LD>   As of Tuesday, NBC dropped its affiliation with San
Francisco-based KRON after the network bought KNTV in mid-December.
San Jose-based KNTV's signal is too weak to blanket the San Francisco
Bay Area's other major cities.</LD>
<LD>   That means many viewers in San Francisco and Oakland lost their
NBC access Tuesday, unless they had cable or a satellite dish.</LD>
<TE>   More than 2 million of the 2.4 million television households in
the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose market have cable or a satellite
dish, but the remainder rely on antennas to catch the signal,
according to NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Even before NBC's switch, 100,000 households couldn't get NBC
programs from KRON due to the Bay Area's mountains or other
impediments. With KNTV's weaker signal, an even greater chunk of the
nation's fifth-largest television market won't be able to see such
popular shows as "West Wing" and "Friends."</TE>
<TE>   Station managers say they hope to boost KNTV's signal within a few
years.</TE>

<HD>Mexico to Trim Oil Output by 100,000 Barrels a Day</HD>
<DH>Energy: Move comes at behest of OPEC. Prices for crude on
world market have fallen 30% since Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Applauding the decision by OPEC to cut oil output, Mexico on Tuesday
reaffirmed it would join the effort to bolster lackluster world
prices by reducing its own exports by 100,000 barrels a day in the
first half of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   The oil-rich nation, which is not a member of OPEC but a key
player because it ranks among the top three oil suppliers to the
United States, said its cut would take effect immediately in concert
with OPEC's tightening of supplies by 1.5 million barrels daily.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico agreed in November to rein in its exports if other non-OPEC
powerhouses joined the effort to reverse sinking oil prices, which
slid 30% after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks further weakened a
stagnant world economy.</LD>
<TE>   Mexico's energy ministry said in a statement it was confident the
OPEC and non-OPEC supply cuts "will achieve a healthy balance between
supply and demand, which will allow a halt in the fall of prices and
assure the necessary investments to maintain a sure and reliable
supply of oil." It had not been clear, however, where the cut would
put Mexico's export levels.</TE>
<TE>   The energy ministry said the new export cap would be 1.66 million
barrels daily--a cut from what Mexico had forecast in its 2002 budget
but roughly in line with November's average exports.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's cut and pledges from Norway, Russia, Oman and Angola
tallied the independent producers' contribution to 462,500 barrels
daily.</TE>
<TE>   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had
pressured the non-OPEC producers to chip in with 500,000 barrels in
reductions in order for the cartel to go ahead with its own 1.5
million barrels a day cut.</TE>
<TE>   The oil price plunge has forced Mexico into a tough fiscal spot.
Because the government relies on oil for more than a third of its
income, lower oil prices can force painful budget cuts--a chief
reason why Mexico joined in the OPEC effort to raise rock-bottom
prices in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Mexico's economy is closely tied to the economy
of the United States, where higher energy costs could frustrate an
economic recovery expected to take root in mid-2002.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. recession already has sapped Mexico's economy, which
sends 85% of its exports to the United States. Mexico's gross
domestic product is forecast to contract 0.26% in 2001, a sharp
reverse from 2000's red-hot growth of 6.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even as Mexico reins in its exports, the state-run oil
industry probably will see more investment cash in 2002, thanks to a
tax package designed to reduce the nation's reliance on oil revenue.</TE>
<TE>   After months of deadlock over tax reform, Mexico's Congress early
Tuesday passed a package of new levies that will lift government
income by about $7.6 billion, or 1% of gross domestic product.</TE>

<HD>No Longer So Remote</HD>
<DH>Regulation: A new state law will give $10 million a year as
grant money to communities that lack phone service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER COLEMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HIOUCHI, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Every 10 days or so, as he makes the 35-mile drive from the Buddhist
hermitage where he's the caretaker to Crescent City, Sam Babcock
stops to use the pay phone outside the Hiouchi Hamlet general store.</LD>
<LD>   "I can check my messages here," said Babcock of the phone in the
isolated community in northwestern California's Del Norte County.</LD>
<LD>   Babcock and dozens like him use the pay phone because they're
among the 112,000 or more Californians without regular telephone
service. From Hiouchi to pockets of the Sierra Nevada, residents of
dozens of communities are unable to make calls that most Americans
take for granted.</LD>
<TE>   Although they live in the state that's home to the high-tech
Silicon Valley, these Californians can connect to the rest of the
world only by radios or spotty cellular coverage. Calls for help to
police or fire departments often disappear into the void.</TE>
<TE>   For rescue workers in Charleston View in Inyo County, the lack of
telephone service makes it hard to respond to emergency calls, said
Bruce Stevenson of the South Inyo Volunteer Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   That area, heavily traveled by tourists, is a 25-mile drive from
the nearest pay phone in Tecopa, Calif., or Pahrump, Nev.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got one curve coming in there that, cross your fingers, no
one has been killed on this year," Stevenson said. It's a 30-minute
drive to the area "once we got the call, and that's assuming the
person has a cell phone."</TE>
<TE>   Even then, Stevenson said, the erratic cell phone service bounces
911 calls first to Nevada dispatchers in Las Vegas, Pahrump or
Winnemucca.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the lack of service is money--telephone companies
can't make a profit in these small communities.</TE>
<TE>   It cost Ducor Telephones $1.2million and two years to bring
service to the tiny Sierra Nevada town of Kennedy Meadows, said
Ducor's Eric Wolfe. The first phone was installed there in 1999, and
now there are 100 customers.</TE>
<TE>   The 23 residents of the Eagle Ranch subdivision in Lake County
have been quoted prices up to $250,000 to bring a telephone line into
the neighborhood but not to individual homes, said 16-year resident
Carol Splain.</TE>
<TE>   Under a new law, the state is giving $10 million a year in grants
to extend service to areas without phones. The Public Utilities
Commission will start accepting applications next summer.</TE>
<TE>   Communities are already looking for grant money. Trinity County
wants a $1.25-million grant to install five cellular telephone towers
to bring service to one-third of its 13,000 residents, county
Supervisor Robert Reiss said.</TE>
<TE>   The county's steep terrain makes it impossible for telephone
companies to bury transmission lines, Reiss said. The grant would
help "tie our county into the outside world."</TE>
<TE>   Without phone service--particularly land lines--residents of this
part of California also are strangers to the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In Del Norte County's Big Flat area, Supervisor Chuck Blackburn
and his 18 neighbors depend on radio phones for communications, but
that's not enough these days. "It's getting to where you have to have
computer access, Internet access," Blackburn said.</TE>
<TE>   Radio phones have their own drawbacks. Like CB radios, they allow
anyone with a scanner to listen in--which means few things remain
secret.</TE>
<TE>   That makes it difficult for respiratory therapist Clark Moore in
Big Flat to be on call at the hospital in Crescent City, 45 minutes
away. "I just had to get in the car and drive to town when they
called," because he couldn't discuss confidential patient information
on the radio.</TE>
<TE>   Before she got her new cell phone, Dawn Rogers said, residents in
Iowa Hills, Calif., with an emergency either used the CB or fired
three shots and "hoped the neighbors heard."</TE>
<TE>   Cellular technology, although not always reliable, has finally
brought telephone service to some residents. "This is my first phone,
ever," Rogers said.</TE>
<TE>   The community's K-8 school, with nine students this year,
communicated by radio phone for years. Last month, the school's
computer was connected to the Internet--through a satellite.</TE>
<GT></GT>
<CP>PHOTO: Dawn Rogers in the northern Sierra Nevada town of
Iowa Hill, Calif., uses her first phone. Although not always
reliable, her cell phone is a step up from using CB radios and three
gunshots during emergencies. Rogers is comforted by the security the
service provides.</CP>

<HD>Airports Using Old Equipment Against New Threats</HD>
<DH>Security: Screening for terrorist weapons is still woefully
low-tech at many U.S. facilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN D. SALANT</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>At airports, the war on terrorism is being fought with 30-year-old
weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Metal detectors and X-ray machines used to screen passengers and
carry-on luggage date from the 1970s, when they were deployed to
prevent hijackings.</LD>
<LD>   They can't detect plastic explosives, such as those allegedly
hidden in the shoes of a man aboard a Paris-to-Miami flight Dec. 22.
A passenger, Richard C. Reid was arrested after American Airlines
attendants allegedly saw him try to touch a lighted match to his
sneakers.</LD>
<TE>   "Most equipment that is deployed is a generation old," said Rep.
John L. Mica (R-Fla.), chairman of the House aviation subcommittee.
"You need highly sophisticated equipment that will detect explosive
materials."</TE>
<TE>   Even the current metal detectors could be replaced with more
modern equipment, former Federal Aviation Administration security
chief Billie Vincent said.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the level of threat, we do not want to grandfather
anything," Vincent said.</TE>
<TE>   Developing and deploying such equipment will be the job of the new
Transportation Security Administration, which is to take control of
airline security by Feb. 19.</TE>
<TE>   But President Bush's nominee to head the agency, John Magaw, is
still awaiting confirmation by the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Security Administration spokesman Paul Takemoto
said the new agency is looking at new technology to help screen
passengers. The FAA is helping to develop such equipment at its
technical center in Atlantic City, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   One low-tech solution is on the way. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown
said the agency plans to hire an additional 90 bomb-sniffing dogs to
be deployed at 25 airports. There now are 180 dogs at 39 airports.</TE>
<TE>   The new aviation security law requires a system in place at each
airport to screen all checked bags by explosive detection machines by
the end of this year. Beginning Jan. 18, all checked bags must be
inspected for explosives by machine, hand, bomb-sniffing dog or
ensuring that the luggage is not loaded on an airplane unless the
passenger boards.</TE>

<HD>With More Exposure, Capital, Success Might Be in the Bag</HD>
<DH>Entrepreneur: An established partner should help 4-year-old
Sarah Shaw Handbags endure growing pains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CYNDIA ZWAHLEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Julia Roberts and Jill Hennessy carry her handbags on screen.
Magazines like Elle and InStyle feature them, and "Friends" stars
Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox Arquette and Lisa Kudrow got them as
Christmas presents.</LD>
<LD>   The exposure has been good for Sarah Shaw Handbags, whose playful
totes come in sherbet-colored stripes and zigzag edges. Sales are
expected to top $700,000 this year, Shaw's fourth full year in
business.</LD>
<LD>   That's not a bad start for a five-person operation with its roots
in a crafts club Shaw formed with a few girlfriends in the
entertainment industry, where she once worked as a costume
supervisor. But the fast start has brought with it some growing
pains.</LD>
<TE>   Poor financing and expensive production have slowed sales growth
below company projections and hampered new product introductions,
Shaw said. A former business partner left abruptly in September. And
money raised early in 2001 was used up more quickly than expected.</TE>
<TE>   A hot product and an eager market, it turns out, aren't the only
factors necessary for success, said Shaw, 37, chief executive and
majority shareholder of the company.</TE>
<TE>   "Wishful thinking," is how she now describes parts of the business
plan she presented to raise $200,000 from friends and family last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the setbacks and the faltering economy, Shaw said she is
optimistic about her Los Angeles company's prospects in the new year
after making several changes to address key weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   Those changes include a deal with accessories manufacturer Pacific
Connections of Ontario to finance the manufacture of her goods and to
handle distribution and accounting. In return, Pacific Connections
will get a share of profit and probably an equity stake in the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw also has revamped her Web site (www.shopsarahshaw.com),
polished her product placement efforts and just shipped her first
test order to an overseas manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   Although the full effect of these changes won't be known for
months, Shaw said she is encouraged by the early results.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at the Web site tripled in a three-month period, hitting
$10,000 in November while the number of visitors doubled to almost
50,000, Shaw said.</TE>
<TE>   The site was redesigned by Earthstores.com, which also improved
Shaw's presence in several key search engines, such as Yahoo (Pacific
Connections has a minority stake in Earthstores.com).</TE>
<TE>   "We used to be pages and pages back. So far back I could never
find it," Shaw said.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw also has been able to break into major department stores. The
company has had several orders from Bergdorf Goodman and received a
test order from Bloomingdale's that allows the store to return
anything it doesn't sell.</TE>
<TE>   "I never would have been able to afford to do that on my own,"
Shaw said.</TE>
<TE>   The company also has enjoyed expanded exposure of its merchandise
through the product placement and publicity efforts of Shaw's older
sister, Lizzie, a Hollywood veteran who now handles marketing and
publicity for the company.</TE>
<TE>   The connections help: One of the latest additions to the Sarah
Shaw Handbags line is a gold glitter-leather evening clutch based on
the one she designed for Roberts to carry in "Ocean's Eleven."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been buying Sarah Shaw since she started making bags," said
Debra McGuire, costume designer for TV's "Friends" and "Crossing
Jordan," starring Hennessy.</TE>
<TE>   But Shaw, who started her business selling her handbags on studio
back lots, said she knows she will need more than her connections to
have global reach--hence the deal with Pacific Connections.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw's line of totes, purses, makeup bags and accessories caught
the company's eye when a consultant introduced her to com pany
officials last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sea of black [handbags], Sarah Shaw stood out as an
individual line you could recognize," said Bob Gutwillig, senior vice
president of corporate development for Pacific Connections, which
makes and distributes handbags and accessories for clients ranging
from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Neiman Marcus Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very talented, and talent is what it's all about," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Connections hopes to grow Shaw's brand to a point where it
can license her name on other products. The company currently
licenses five brand names, including Elle and B.U.M. Equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Although their one-year deal is only a few months old,
negotiations are already underway for Pacific Connections to acquire
a 20% stake in Shaw's company. Shaw welcomes the equity deal, she
said, because it will help give her company financial stability.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw was introduced to Pacific Connections through apparel
industry consultant Bruce Berton, a principal at Stonefield Josephson
Inc. in Santa Monica. He knew Pacific Connections was looking to
capitalize on its warehouse, shipping and accounting resources
through outsourcing deals with smaller companies in which it might
potentially invest.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw's company seemed a perfect fit. She had the design expertise
but was saddled with high domestic production costs and skimpy cash
flow. Cash flow can be a particular problem for apparel companies
because they have to pay for materials and manufacturing long before
the products are sold. Shaw, for example, is about to begin buying
fabric for her fall 2002 line. The money to do so is coming from
Pacific Connections.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Connections also warehouses and distributes handbags to
Shaw's retail clients, which include Fred Segal in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Connections' money is expected to stretch much further
once Shaw moves her production overseas. Cheaper manufacturing costs
will allow Shaw to raise her profit margins while lowering prices
slightly, she said. It also will give her the option to expand into
small leather goods such as wallets and date books, which she said
are too expensive for her line if made domestically.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all been a little overwhelming," said Shaw, who designs four
lines a year. "But I figure once I have the production [costs] down a
little bit better it will be easier for me to expand more quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Any expansion will face an uncertain retail environment, and not
just because of the economic slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Karimzadeh, accessories market editor at Women's Wear Daily,
notes that booming sales in recent years has attracted everyone from
Monica Lewinsky to Cartier into the handbag business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a category that is increasingly competitive as well as
possibly saturated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gutwillig concedes its a "morose retail economy" but says Pacific
Connections is willing to be patient while the line establishes
itself.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not expecting miracles. We just want to stabilize the
business and then move forward," he said.</TE>

<HD>Next Retail Challenge</HD>
<DH>Sales: As spring merchandise arrives, stores must figure
out how to wean customers off deep holiday discounting in a tough
economic climate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE D'INNOCENZIO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Margaret Lowe, who has always loved finding a good bargain, admits
she's become addicted amid all the heavy discounting that defined
this holiday season.</LD>
<LD>   ''Who wants 20% when you can now get 40%?'' said the Palm Coast,
Fla., resident while shopping at Rockefeller Center. As for buying
anything at regular price for the spring and beyond, she responded,
''Not anymore.''</LD>
<LD>   Lowe and many other shoppers present a challenge for retailers as
they start to bring in spring merchandise: How do they wean customers
off discounts and get them to pay full price? Can shoppers just go
cold turkey and do without discounts, particularly in an economic
environment that's not expected to improve until later in 2002?</LD>
<TE>   "Consumers were already hardened before,'' said Wendy Leibmann, a
New York-based trend consultant. "Now, they are really hardened. Even
20% discounts look stingy.''</TE>
<TE>   The issue might be even more critical for upscale retailers, such
as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Brooks Brothers, all of
which resorted to unprecedented holiday discounting to entice
customers to buy.</TE>
<TE>   The deals are even more generous now as retailers try to get rid
of mounds of holiday leftovers to make room for spring merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   At Saks' New York store last week, racks of already discounted
designer merchandise were marked down an additional 40%. A Giorgio
Armani suit, with an original price tag of $2,250, was twice marked
down, and could be purchased for $809.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks Brothers featured big red signs that announced additional
discounts anywhere from 30% to 50% off already reduced merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Such heavy discounting is not only disastrous for a retailer's
profit, but also could harm a tony brand image.</TE>
<TE>   "Luxury retailers significantly overreacted. Their brand hasn't
been eroded yet, but they can't do it again,'' said Steven Skinner, a
partner of retail strategy at Accenture, a consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Department stores and specialty retailers are under particular
pressure from heavy discounting.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, based in
Montclair, N.J., noted that "customers received an education probably
as never before in terms of values and in terms of pricing and in
terms of playing one store against the other.''</TE>
<TE>   Skinner said, ''If retailers continue to mark down, they begin to
send a signal that maybe they were overpriced to begin with.''</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., known for its everyday low pricing, is one
merchant that doesn't seem to have that problem. It reported
better-than-expected holiday sales gains of at least 6% with "minimal
markdowns''--a testament to its pricing power.</TE>
<TE>   Other retailers hoping to escape the markdown trap need to start
working toward that goal now, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Skinner said upscale stores should eliminate any big "sale''
signs, opting for more subtle alternatives. For example, the Giorgio
Armani store in San Francisco keeps its marked-down merchandise in a
back room, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Barnard believes retailers should try to gradually wean consumers
away from discounts.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, merchants must focus on innovative products and upgrade
their services to persuade customers to buy at regular price, trend
consultant Leibmann said.</TE>
<TE>   "You constantly have to have new items that no one else has,'' she
added.</TE>
<TE>   That has worked well for Bloomingdale's, which offered fewer
discounts than a year ago, but still was able to meet its modest
holiday revenue goals, Chairman Michael Gould said.</TE>
<TE>   High-end jewelry and fashion boots sold well at regular price at
Bloomingdale's. So did an exclusive $399 Motorola cell phone with a
two-way radio and a pager--several thousand were sold at regular
price.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Robert Burke, vice president of fashion at Bergdorf
Goodman, said he was heartened by strong sales of early spring
offerings from the likes of Chanel and Pucci.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it was a tough fall and holiday season. But this is a new
season, a new year,'' he said. "I feel that the consumer is
rebounding.''</TE>
<TE>   That may not be good news for bargain-hungry customers such as
Shoghere Markarian, from Manhattan, who were able to trade up to
luxury retailers this holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "I bought a sweater at Henri Bendel at 40% off,'' said Markarian,
who also said she usually sticks to Daffy's and other off-price
outlets.</TE>

<HD>AOL, Harvard in 'Spam' Jam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Dozens of e-mail messages telling Harvard University applicants
whether they had been admitted never arrived last month after America
Online interpreted the messages as junk e-mail.</LD>
<LD>   "This wasn't exactly the instant response we intended," William
Fitzsimmons, Harvard's dean of admissions and financial aid, told the
Boston Globe.</LD>
<LD>   After anthrax spores were mailed through the U.S. postal system,
Harvard began using e-mail to inform applicants quickly of whether
they had been rejected or accepted. E-mail was used to notify almost
all of the 6,000 students who applied in the school's early admission
process.</LD>
<TE>   But for reasons that even AOL could not explain, the service
blocked between 75 and 100 of the e-mails in December because the
servers flagged the messages as "spam," or unwanted e-mails. The
messages were bounced back to the university.</TE>
<TE>   The problem proved to be more trouble for Harvard than it was for
the students. Most just telephoned the admissions office.  The
university will continue to use the postal system to notify
applicants.</TE>

<HD>He's Passionate About His Supporting Role</HD>
<DH>Music* As principal second violinist of the Pacific
Symphony, Zakarias Grafilo, 26, seeks to help 'make the first violins
sound great.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some members of an orchestra are more visible than others. The
concertmaster--head of the first violin section--makes an entrance
after the other musicians have taken their places onstage. He or she
receives a separate round of applause, plays solos and performs
critical duties that warrant respect.</LD>
<LD>   The principal cellist plays solos too and can easily be seen in
the leading role.</LD>
<LD>   But what about the head of the second violin section, obscured by
all those first violins? How critical is this position?</LD>
<TE>   "He's the heartbeat of the orchestra," says Pacific Symphony
concertmaster Raymond Kobler. "He plays a critical part because he's
caught in the middle, coordinating with all the other parts."</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific's principal second, Zakarias A. Grafilo, who turns 27
on Monday, replaced Amy Sims, who become concertmaster of the Omaha
Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of San Francisco State University, Grafilo also was
concertmaster of the Stockton Symphony, juggling both roles until he
made a total commitment to the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   He was born and raised in San Francisco, and his mother enrolled
him in a Suzuki violin program at San Francisco State when he was 4.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a new toy," Grafilo said. "I don't think I was the
kind of kid who showed a lot of promise on the instrument. I
practiced, but I was a little bit indifferent toward it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he pursued further study in a young musician preparatory
program at the San Francisco Conservatory. That led to lessons for
four years with Serban Rusu, a student of legendary pedagogue Josef
Gingold, and also membership in the San Francisco Youth Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   "Rusu completely changed how I played the instrument. He got me to
think about what it means to play, not necessarily just technically.
There were a lot of philosophical lessons he gave to me," says
Grafilo, citing advice as mundane as how to plan a daily practice
schedule and as sage as how to compare working out something in a
piece of music to working through a problem of life. "You could sit
down and look at it objectively."</TE>
<TE>   Moved Up Through</TE>
<TE>   the Orchestra's Ranks</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra experience also proved pivotal.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned everything you need to learn about playing in an
orchestra, from how you sit to the way you carry yourself in
rehearsal, to how you mark your part."</TE>
<TE>   He joined when he was 13, and by the time he was a high school
senior, he was concertmaster.</TE>
<TE>   "I moved up through the ranks. I didn't feel like I was anything
out of the ordinary, but I felt passionate about what I did. I
enjoyed playing chamber music, and that's how I always look at
playing music. Even in an orchestra setting, I feel that's just a
huge chamber ensemble, and the same principles apply."</TE>
<TE>   For all that, he wasn't sure what he wanted to do as a career. He
went to UCLA, first as a music student and then as an undeclared
major. But he kept working--in the university orchestra, the Young
Musicians Foundation Debut Orchestra and the American Youth Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I loved what I did, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to
pursue a career in music because I knew it would be difficult. I
didn't feel like I was the kind of violinist that I wanted to be. I
didn't think of myself as one type of person. I would hear how
somebody sounds and I would try to emulate it.</TE>
<TE>   "I went through this whole Heifetz phase where I wanted to sound
like him. I think a lot of violinists do. There were times I would
listen to recordings of Oistrakh or Milstein or Grumiaux, and I would
just fall in love with what they were doing on these recordings, and
I would want to try to emulate that. They're all very different in
how they approach the instrument. There's a lot of tradition there
that I picked up on, a lot of artistry."</TE>
<TE>   After UCLA, he returned to San Francisco and its Youth Orchestra,
but working on the administrative side. "I was thinking about going
into arts management. But music was still in the back of my head. One
of the main things that changed how I wanted to pursue my life was
chamber music. I started a quartet. We got this residency at San
Francisco State. The Alexander Quartet, which was in residency there,
helped us out. That got my fire burning again."</TE>
<TE>   He auditioned for the Stockton Symphony in 1999, winning the
concertmaster position. A year later, he auditioned for the Pacific
Symphony, initially getting a position in the back of the first
violin section and then principal second in May when that position
opened up. He played his first concert in the new role on July 4.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Pacific holds "blind" auditions--with candidates
playing behind a screen to ensure no favoritism or prejudice--his
colleagues didn't know he was trying out. But they were delighted
when he won.</TE>
<TE>   "My section has been responsive to what I'm doing up there," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   After traveling back and forth for two years, he resigned from
Stockton in June.</TE>
<TE>   He's Come Full Circle</TE>
<TE>   With His Ex-Mentor</TE>
<TE>   In a way, he's come full circle. Growing up in San Francisco, he
admired the San Francisco Symphony, where Kobler was concertmaster
from 1980 to 1998 before coming to the Pacific. He also was coached
by Kobler in the Youth Orchestra. Now he's sitting close to his
former mentor and sees his job partly as supporting Kobler's work.</TE>
<TE>   "The role of the second violin principal is to interpret what's
going on on the podium and try to show what that is so that people
behind you can decipher that," Grafilo said.</TE>
<TE>   "Secondly, the job is to make the first violins sound great
because often second violins are written either an octave below or a
third below or a sixth below. A lot of times the first violins don't
sound so great because the second violins are not supporting the
first violins as well as they should be."</TE>
<TE>   Although his career is just getting started, Grafilo knows the
benefits of his position.</TE>
<TE>   "Being here is a good opportunity for me," he said. "I don't think
there is anywhere [else] in the country where you can play orchestra
music, ballet music and even opera [as I am] now that I'm the acting
second violin principal in Opera Pacific, as well. In San Francisco,
you won't get that same kind of playing experience."</TE>
<TE>   * Roberto Minczuk will conduct the Pacific Symphony on Jan. 9 and
10 at 8 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town
Center Drive, Costa Mesa. The program will include works by Borodin,
Prokofiev and Rimsky-Korsakov. Lilya Zilberstein will be the soloist
in Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto. $21 to $56. (714) 556-2787.</TE>

<HD>Digital Images Will Verify Identity of Visitors to U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In a high-tech strategy against terrorists, the government will
soon begin comparing foreign travelers with digitized photographs and
will consider plans to encode their travel documents with personal data
that can be read electronically.</LD>
<LD>   Starting this month, the State Department will relay digital images of
foreign travelers to U.S. ports of entry. For the first time, immigration
officials will be assured that they are comparing the travelers who stand
before them to authentic pictures taken when they applied to visit the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, Congress may approve legislation to mandate unique,
personal identifiers--such as digitized fingerprints--on visas that the
State Department grants to foreign nationals who wish to travel in this
country, as well as on the passports of 29 nations. The bill passed the
House on Dec. 19 and enjoys broad support in the Senate.</LD>
<TE>   While such efforts were prompted by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
the push to employ more sophisticated means of identifying travelers was
spurred further by initial confusion over the identity of Richard C.
Reid, the Briton accused of smuggling a shoe bomb aboard a Miami-bound
jetliner.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's critical. It's coming," said Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.).
"It's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   The emerging strategy is twofold: Travelers will be identified with
greater certainty than in the past, and U.S. government agencies,
including the FBI, will be required to provide more lookout information
about terrorists to inspectors at U.S. entry points. Advocates maintain
that more efficient use of data is needed to thwart terrorist
attempts--and could possibly have stopped some in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the computer screen would have said that according to French
officials, [Reid] is actually a Sri Lankan," said Kyl, alluding to
confusion over the man's identity. At least, Kyl added, "you might have
found out more than officials at the airport found out."</TE>
<TE>Technology to Compare Features</TE>
<TE>   Biometric technologies can match the identity of an individual
applying for a visa or appearing at a port of entry by comparing a unique
physical feature--such as the traveler's fingerprints, image of the
retina or iris, hand geometry or even facial shape--against details
stored in a database.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would require biometric identifiers on visas that
American consulates grant to foreign travelers and for the passports
issued by the 29 nations for which this country has waived most visa
requirements. These nations, including Japan and most of Western Europe,
would have to develop the new passports in keeping with international
biometric standards. Any countries that chose to ignore the rule would be
removed from the visa waiver program.</TE>
<TE>   While the idea of the United States attempting to dictate passport
security standards to other countries is unusual, it is based on recent
episodes of passport forgery by terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   In one major case, Islamic extremists from Tunisia used stolen Belgian
passports in their plot to assassinate Ahmed Shah Masoud, the Northern
Alliance guerrilla leader, on Sept. 9. Critics of the U.S. visa waiver
program have long worried that overseas theft of passports is one of the
weaknesses in the system.</TE>
<TE>   "Such efforts will have a real impact in fighting terrorism and
preventing exploitation of our immigration laws in the future," said Rep.
F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The push is part of a broader effort to harness the potential of
modern technology to secure vulnerable U.S. entry points, where
inspectors face pressure to process travelers swiftly, often with scant
information on their backgrounds. Even before Sept. 11, the State
Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service had begun to
implement such technology for a frequent border-crossing card used by
Mexicans and the green card issued to permanent U.S. residents.</TE>
<TE>   For all the enthusiasm, however, some experts caution that biometric
technologies are not a panacea.</TE>
<TE>   If, for example, a traveler first manages to establish a false
identity and then obtains a passport and other documents, the biometric
system might not flag the individual as an impostor. The technology would
establish only that the traveler is the same person who applied for the
passport.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't a magic bullet. It isn't the 100% solution," said Michael
Thieme, a senior consultant for International Biometric Group, a New
York-based consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Even the time-tested comparison of fingerprints can yield inadequate
results, Thieme said, depending on the particular electronic system that
is used to store the prints digitally and even the condition of a
person's fingertips.</TE>
<TE>   For state-of-the-art identification technologies, such as facial
recognition, in which travelers' facial measurements might be compared
with information on terrorists' faces in a database, the hurdles are
greater.</TE>
<TE>   Vendors of facial recognition equipment conjure up dazzling images of
technology that can spot terrorists in a stream of travelers at airport
checkpoints. But some experts warn that such technology has fallen short
of its promise in real-world tests.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take plastic surgery for the system to go down" and yield
an inaccurate result, Thieme said. "It just takes rudimentary
changes--from smiling to frowning. A different [camera] angle. . . .
People will be flagged as terrorists who are not. I'd be stunned if
that's not the case. There are a lot of things that have to be thought
through. It's more complicated than anybody has an idea of."</TE>
<TE>Inspectors Depend on Tip-Offs</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the technology for identifying people, inspectors at U.S.
ports of entry will remain dependent on cooperation from intelligence and
law enforcement agencies for tip-offs on whom to watch out for. The Sept.
11 hijackers, for example, entered the United States with valid travel
documents, and U.S. consular officials later complained that they had
received virtually no warning from intelligence agencies, which they rely
on for guidance on suspected criminals.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get better information from law enforcement and the
intelligence agencies if we are going to do the job that we have of being
the outer ring of border security," Mary A. Ryan, the State Department
assistant secretary for consular affairs, testified in late October.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, she described the plans to share the photographs of
visa applicants with INS inspectors as "really a tremendous advance"
against people who steal passports and establish fake identities.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, INS computers at the nation's ports of entry are being
given the ability to link up with the State Department's consular
database--which contains images of travelers and their visa
applications--so border inspectors will be able to review such details
while they look people over. Officials at the INS and the State
Department have said the broader capabilities, initially tested in
Newark, N.J., should be in place by the middle of this month.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to use technology as a weapon against terrorists are spreading
beyond the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Germany is considering whether to encode passports with details of a
traveler's unique hand geometry or fingerprints, said officials who do
not see problems in a U.S. mandate for biometric passports.</TE>
<TE>   "Germany is moving in the same direction as the United States is
planning to do," said Hinrich Thoelken, a spokesman for the German
Embassy in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   An official with the European Commission office in Washington said
European nations would need more information about any biometric
requirements that Congress has in mind but added: "The [European Union]
and the United States have a lot of contact on these issues. . . . We're
making improvements all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, the move toward more tamper-proof documents for
foreign travelers hits on a different set of nerves, including issues of
privacy and whether the new rules are paving the way for more intrusive
means of identification that ultimately will be applied to U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're using a thumbprint in order to determine that I'm the same
person as the person in my passport, in general we think of that as a
perfectly reasonable security mechanism," said Cecilia Munoz, vice
president for policy for the National Council of La Raza, a Latino
advocacy group. "But if we're using a biometric identifier to connect to
databases, particularly INS databases that are particularly flawed, that
is a concern."</TE>

<HD>A Wave of Patriotism on Parade in Pasadena</HD>
<DH>Traditions: A New York state of mind makes for a red, white and
blue Tournament of Roses. Security, emotions high.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Tournament of Roses wrapped itself in red carnations, white
mums and blue statice Tuesday, kicking off the new year with a parade fit
for the Fourth of July.</LD>
<LD>   The 113th Rose Parade began with Grand Marshal Regis Philbin
introducing a U.S. Marine Corps band and ended with a show of force: the
West Point Marching Band, a Veterans of Foreign Wars float and an
equestrian group from the U.S. Marshals Service. In between, Colorado
Boulevard was a river of flags, worn by a prize-winning fisherman, a
Swedish cowboy, Spanish horses, Lutherans, bungee jumpers and animated
cats and dogs. The parade even had Richard Riordan campaigning for
governor (on the float of a medical company) as if it were midsummer.</LD>
<LD>   The patriotic demonstration was relatively peaceful. From 5 p.m. New
Year's Eve to 11 a.m. Tuesday, there were 59 arrests along the 5 1/2-mile
parade route, down from 78 last year. While broadcasters trumpeted the
traditional crowd estimate of 1 million, police and veteran parade-goers
said the crowd seemed slightly smaller this year.</LD>
<TE>   Some blamed terrorism fears, which led to additional security that was
obvious to fans at the beginning of the route. Others pointed out that
football fans might be home resting for this year's Rose Bowl. Since it
was designated the national championship game for the first time this
year, the bowl won't take place until Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite threatening skies, rain showers never came, confirming local
suspicion that Pasadena is Mother Nature's favorite child.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the quintessential American experience," said 48-year-old
Lucy Solis, vacationing here from Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   As such, much of the parade--from equestrians' uniforms to float
colors to band music sheets--had been tweaked after Sept. 11 to match the
times. Fans and float riders were as likely to chant "USA!" as "Happy New
Year!"</TE>
<TE>   Red, white and blue ribbons hung from horses' bridles. A high school
band from Blue Springs, Mo., played "Appalachian Spring"; the one from
Kennewick, Wash., preferred "America the Beautiful." FA/18s and a B-2
"Spirit" Stealth bomber made noisy flyovers.</TE>
<TE>   One float, sponsored by Boeing, was redesigned to include an American
eagle coming out of a red, white, and blue box. Even the piles of cotton
candy were red, white and blue.</TE>
<TE>   "I was here early," said Rickie Crayton of Los Angeles, who was trying
to unload plastic bags of patriotic T-shirts and small American flags for
$5 each. "I thought that with all this patriotism, at least people would
want them to look good for the camera."</TE>
<TE>   Crayton, 26, was disappointed with early sales but held out hope that
his "I (Heart) FDNY" and "Operation Enduring Freedom" T-shirts would sell
at Thursday's big game.</TE>
<TE>New York State of Mind Dominates Parade Route</TE>
<TE>   Some parade fans said they came in hopes of finding a New Year's
respite from talk of Sept. 11. But the Tournament of Roses made it clear
that the tragedy of 2001 will shadow 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the Marine Corps, the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, and the New York City police and fire departments rode on
a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power float. Frank Scott Bunnell
High School from Stratford, Conn., played "New York, New York." The St.
Augustine High School Marching Hundred, from New Orleans, did a somber
turn with "Stand By Me." And the band from the Los Angeles Unified School
District performed "On Broadway."</TE>
<TE>   Tragedy hung over other performers in various ways. It did not escape
parade-goers' mention that the American Society of Civil Engineers float
was dominated by miniature skyscrapers and bridges that have been
identified as possible terrorist targets. And some of the day's biggest
cheers were for the band from Colorado's Columbine High School, the site
of the deadliest school shooting rampage in American history less than
three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In a bow to fears, security was tightened around the intersection of
Colorado Boulevard and Orange Grove, from which TV stations broadcast the
parade. Airspace was restricted. But farther east on the route,
11-year-old Mark and 8-year-old Max Lomeli, loquacious brothers from
Fresno, covered cars with tortillas smothered in shaving cream--without
attracting law enforcement scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born that way," said Mark, explaining his mischief.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about terrorism led some to have second thoughts about
attending. Riverside's Sylvia Rodriguez, 44, was planning to stay home
this year until her husband, Jesus, threatened to go without her. Ron
Kidd and his wife, who live in Nashville but have been coming to the Rose
Parade since 1977, says they still regret skipping the 2000 parade
because of Y2K fears.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm less concerned about security this year," said Barbara Mirales of
Sierra Madre, who spent three nights sleeping in a RV along the route.
"It seems that people were a lot calmer this year too."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it was fear or the two-day wait for football, some
parade-goers could be forgiven for finding Tuesday a bit disorienting.
Honda's float was titled "Born in the USA." The oil giant British
Petroleum created a float showing a lush, unspoiled, prehistoric jungle.
Instead of basking in Pasadena's New Year's Day weather (highs reached
the mid-60s), the band and cheerleaders from this year's East Coast Rose
Bowl team complained about the cold.</TE>
<TE>   They are from the University of Miami.</TE>
<TE>Even Better Than Lawrence Welk Museum</TE>
<TE>   A visitor from colder climes, Irva Latimer, an 87-year-old resident of
Des Moines, wasn't complaining. She decided she liked the Rose Parade
even more than the Lawrence Welk museum in Escondido.</TE>
<TE>   Rain Bird Sprinkler Manufacturing won the Sweepstakes Trophy as most
beautiful entry for a float featuring Bengal tigers. Florist's Transworld
Delivery earned the President's Trophy for most effective floral
presentation for an Alice in Wonderland entry. The city of Long Beach
earned the trophy for most beautiful float entered by a noncommercial
sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   Two floats, including one carrying the Rose queen and her court, broke
down. The most spectacular failure was by "Guiding Good Times," the
first-time entry of Guide Dogs for the Blind.</TE>
<TE>   After its brakes locked, the float was pulled out of the parade.
Michael Hingson sat patiently as his guide dog, Roselle, licked at rice
and seeds on the float and white-suited organizers waved bands and horses
by. Roselle, a yellow Labrador, had led her 51-year-old owner, who is
blind, down from the 78th floor of the World Trade Center to safety on
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, they couldn't get down Colorado Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, at least we were in it," Hingson said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Francisco Gonzalez, 30, of Pasadena didn't notice the
breakdown. He was too busy making change for tourists who wanted to buy
American flags and stars-and-stripes hats.</TE>
<TE>   "America is what sells," he said.</TE>

<HD>Cases Reveal Lapses in Kaiser Emergency Care</HD>
<DH>Health: Nine arbitration proceedings offer a rare look into HMO. It
denies any pattern of negligence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES HEALTH WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kaiser Permanente doctor who examined Harun Antwine had worked
at least 10 hours that day, seeing 25 patients in his office and 15 more
that evening at the HMO's Fontana urgent care center.</LD>
<LD>   The swamped physician didn't spot Antwine's serious bacterial
infection, and the 29-year-old patient left urgent care without
antibiotics, Antwine's family lawyer says. The father of three young
children died two days later.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a classic case of failing to treat a patient [who] really
needed it," said lawyer Gregory Patton, who won an $848,000 arbitration
award from Kaiser stemming from Antwine's 1998 death. "Their doctors are
really, really overworked."</LD>
<TE>   In justifying a $1.1-million fine against Kaiser, state regulators
cited three patient deaths and said the cases demonstrated a pattern of
problems in emergency care that has put the HMO's 6 million California
members at risk.</TE>
<TE>   Similar problems showed up in at least nine other cases since
1995--including Antwine's--in which arbitrators found Kaiser liable for
patient injuries or deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Although the number of arbitration awards is small, and Kaiser calls
the cases anomalies, critics say they illustrate the same dangers
identified by state officials: not enough staff and overcrowded
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser, the state's largest HMO, denies that it has systemic problems
and argues that the state's HMO czar, Daniel Zingale, has overstepped his
authority. It is challenging the fine, which was imposed in 2000 and was
increased last year.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Kaiser said the arbitration awards reviewed by The Times
should not be considered a pattern, given the millions of patients who
seek care through the HMO.</TE>
<TE>   "These cases are obviously things that everybody wants to pay
attention to," Kaiser spokesman Jim Anderson said. "But to suggest
anything other than that they represent [nine] individual medical
malpractice cases is stretching a long way, we think."</TE>
<TE>   Arbitration awards, though relatively rare, are among the few public
avenues available for examining patient complaints against Kaiser.
Dissatisfied Kaiser patients seeking damages must go through arbitration,
because the HMO requires enrollees to waive their right to sue.</TE>
<TE>   According to the nine arbitration summaries, Kaiser has been ordered
to pay more than $3.5 million for lapses in emergency or urgent care
since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   That amount represents only a fraction of what Kaiser has paid out in
cases that were settled and sealed from the view of the public and HMO
regulators, patients' lawyers say. Kaiser has settled nearly half of its
recent arbitration cases, records show.</TE>
<TE>   The nine cases reviewed by The Times include those of:</TE>
<TE>   * A 39-year-old diabetic woman who died after her chemical imbalance
went undetected by an urgent care doctor in Lancaster.</TE>
<TE>   * A 6-year-old boy who died in the hospital after the Kaiser urgent
care center in Panorama City failed to diagnose a heart ailment.</TE>
<TE>   * A 64-year-old man who died of an undiagnosed ruptured abdominal
aortic aneurysm at the Woodland Hills urgent care center.</TE>
<TE>   * A 41-year-old man who went to Kaiser's Panorama City emergency room,
where his chest pain was attributed to yardwork. The man visited Kaiser
facilities twice more before dying five days later of a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said the nine arbitration awards involved different
facilities, different patient symptoms and different outcomes. He said
Kaiser has 11 emergency rooms in Southern California that see 800,000
patients a year and that many more people visit urgent care centers.</TE>
<TE>   The arbitration cases also span a significant period of time, Anderson
said. Though all were decided since 1995 and most involved incidents in
the last decade, one dates to 1987. Arbitration cases can take years to
resolve.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser argues that even if everyone does their best, patients
sometimes die.</TE>
<TE>   That, Kaiser claims, is what happened in the case of Antwine, the
29-year-old who died of a bacterial infection.</TE>
<TE>   When the patient arrived at the urgent care center, arbitration
filings say, he wasn't exhibiting typical symptoms of a strep bacterial
infection. Even if he had been given antibiotics, the HMO said, Antwine
would have died.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say such cases should not be viewed in isolation. In fact, the
state findings and the arbitration claims are, in some instances,
remarkably similar.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the cases won in arbitration involved patients who died of
undiagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysms, the problem also found by the
state in its investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In their fine, state regulators cited the case of Wolfgang Spunbarg, a
72-year-old enrollee who went to the Woodland Hills emergency room in
April 2000 complaining of severe pain in his abdomen and testicles.</TE>
<TE>   According to the hearing testimony of Spunbarg's wife, Edith, she
pleaded with the ER receptionist to have someone examine her husband
immediately but was told that the ER was too busy and that she would have
to wait.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 minutes after arriving, she burst into the examination area
of the ER and demanded that a doctor see her husband. Moments later, he
fell unconscious; he died within two hours of an undiagnosed abdominal
aortic aneurysm.</TE>
<TE>   According to filings in a separate arbitration case, Gery Lichtig, 64,
had gone to the urgent care center at the same hospital 13 months
earlier, complaining of serious abdominal and back pain. As in the
Spunbarg case, Lichtig's wife, Temah, pleaded with the receptionist to
call a physician.</TE>
<TE>   After being seen by a nurse, Lichtig waited 45 minutes, retching in
pain, according to the arbitration filings.</TE>
<TE>   On his way back from having X-rays taken, the documents state, Lichtig
leaned back in his wheelchair and screamed, "The pain, the pain!" His
eyes then rolled back, and he fell unconscious. He died less than three
hours later, also of a ruptured aneurysm.</TE>
<TE>   Temah Lichtig said the state's findings were like a horrible echo of
her own experience with Kaiser.</TE>
<TE>   "The state is so accurate in everything that they're saying," she
said. "They're just calling it like it is."</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser is challenging the $1.1-million fine before an administrative
law judge, claiming that Zingale does not have the authority to regulate
care provided by its hospitals and doctors. Testimony resumes this month
in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Defending the fine, Zingale said the California Department of Managed
Health Care found that Kaiser doctors and nurses failed "to communicate .
. . the seriousness of a patient's condition and the need for a rapid
response."</TE>
<TE>   He said some of the claims raised in the arbitration cases reviewed by
The Times seem "of a similar nature to what we're looking at." But the
cases were not cited in support of the fine because they alleged
individual instances of medical malpractice, not systemic problems.</TE>
<TE>   Several patients' lawyers said they did not allege systemic problems,
because winning individual malpractice cases does not require proof of
widespread flaws.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs' lawyers say Kaiser's problems are more extensive--and
the real toll paid by the HMO is far higher--than the public record
suggests. The awards obtained through arbitration reflect only those
cases in which a verdict was reached, not those settled confidentially.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser declined to discuss the number of cases that it has settled or
their amounts.</TE>
<TE>   "There's systemic problems with everything they do," said Bruce
Levenson, a Beverly Hills lawyer who represented the family of the
diabetic woman who died. "I think they give you as little care as they
possibly can. . . . They cut corners."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, however, said Kaiser is more likely than other HMOs to be
targeted by arbitration complaints because it owns its hospitals and
works primarily with one doctors group. As a result, patients associate
quality of care with the HMO itself.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser is also more likely to face action related to the quality of
patient care from state HMO regulators, as Zingale himself acknowledges.</TE>
<TE>   But some lawyers and family members who have won arbitration awards
against Kaiser say they only wish its flaws had come to light sooner.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to help bring this awareness to other people so Gery's death
will not have been in vain," Temah Lichtig said. "This man did not have
to die."</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser argues that he could not have been saved.</TE>
<TE>   "People can do their very best and do everything right and do
superhuman efforts, and the patient will still suffer a bad outcome,"
Anderson said. "That's just a sad fact of medical life."</TE>

<TE>Arbitration Awards</TE>
<TE>   At least nine times since 1995, arbitrators have found Kaiser
Permanente liable for lapses in care provided to patients at its
emergency rooms and urgent care centers. Arbitration cases sometimes are
decided well after the alleged lapses occur.</TE>
<TE>   1995</TE>
<TE>   Arbitration award: $350,000</TE>
<TE>   Claim: Kaiser should have hospitalized a 43-year-old woman with asthma
when she went to the emergency room in Riverside in January 1993,
complaining of fever, shortness of breath and other problems. Instead,
the hospital sent her home. She died the next day after returning to the
emergency room with respiratory distress.</TE>
<TE>   1996</TE>
<TE>   Arbitration award: $325,000</TE>
<TE>   Claim: Kaiser failed to diagnose a heart problem in a 41-year-old gas
station owner who went to the emergency room in Panorama City with chest
pain, sweating and arm numbness in 1994. Doctor attributed muscle pain to
yardwork and sent man home. He returned to Kaiser twice before he died
June 10 of a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   1997</TE>
<TE>   Arbitration award: $500,000</TE>
<TE>   Claim: Kaiser failed to prescribe antibiotics to a 4-year-old child
who went to the Anaheim emergency room with fever, nausea and joint pain
in February 1987. The child developed bacterial spinal meningitis and
became deaf as a result of the condition.</TE>
<TE>   Arbitration award: $257,190</TE>
<TE>   Claim: Kaiser Bellflower emergency room failed to hospitalize a
48-year-old woman who complained of chest pain, low blood pressure and
anemia in 1993. She died four days later of a ruptured abdominal aortic
aneurysm.</TE>
<TE>   1999</TE>
<TE>   Arbitration award: $848,000</TE>
<TE>   Claim: Kaiser urgent care center in Fontana failed to treat a
bacterial infection in a 29-year-old food service manager in March 1998.
Physician discharged him despite high fever and inability to walk. He
died of complications from the infection.</TE>
<TE>   Arbitration award: $250,000</TE>
<TE>   Claim: Kaiser urgent care center in Mission Viejo failed to remove
glass from the knee of a 9-year-old girl who struck a glass cabinet door
in May 1995. Glass was removed surgically more than two years later,
causing cartilage damage.</TE>
<TE>   Arbitration award: $407,000</TE>
<TE>   Claim: Kaiser urgent care center in Panorama City failed to diagnose a
viral heart ailment in a 6-year-old boy who sought medical care in May
1994. Although he was admitted to a hospital, the boy died several hours
later.</TE>
<TE>   2001</TE>
<TE>   Arbitration award: $375,000</TE>
<TE>   Claim: Kaiser urgent care center in Lancaster failed to diagnose a
chemical imbalance and dehydration in a 39-year-old diabetic woman who
sought help in January 1999. She was discharged and died hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Arbitration award: $354,500</TE>
<TE>   Claim: Kaiser urgent care center in Woodland Hills did not diagnose a
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in a 64-year-old man who died while
seeking care in March 1999.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Fears Abuses of Terror Mandate</HD>
<DH>Policy: Rights monitors see some governments using new requirements
to justify repression.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>Demands by the Security Council that U.N. members act against
global terrorism are being used by some regimes to justify repression of
domestic dissent, U.N. officials and independent human rights advocates
say.</LD>
<LD>   The anti-terrorism campaign has been used by authoritarian governments
to justify moves to clamp down on moderate opponents, outlaw criticism of
rulers and expand the use of capital punishment.</LD>
<LD>   Compliance with the Security Council requirements "could lead to
unwarranted infringement on civil liberties," Bacre Waly Ndiaye, the
chief human rights officer at the U.N. Secretariat, told the council's
new counterterrorism committee. "There is evidence that some countries
are now introducing measures that may erode core human rights
safeguards."</LD>
<TE>   In an unexpectedly swift response to the attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, the Security Council called on U.N. members on
Sept. 28 to provide information within 90 days about their legal
restrictions on fund-raising, financial transfers, arms acquisition and
immigration.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no agreement on what constitutes terrorist activity, U.N.
experts say, and some governments are presenting what critics contend are
police-state measures as part of the U.N.-endorsed campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "In some countries," Ndiaye told the counterterror committee at its
Dec. 13 meeting, "nonviolent activities have been considered as
terrorism, and excessive measures have been taken to suppress or restrict
individual rights, including the presumption of innocence, the right to a
fair trial, freedom from torture, privacy rights, freedom of expression
and assembly, and the right to seek asylum."</TE>
<TE>   Ndiaye carefully refrained from identifying those countries, but human
rights advocates quickly came up with a long list, from Algeria to
Zimbabwe. In an interview at his office here last week, Ndiaye said he
was concerned that the campaign could backfire and undermine U.N. efforts
to promote democracy and the rule of law in Eastern Europe, Southeast
Asia and his native West Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is how to make counterterrorism measures compatible
with human rights," he said. "Unfortunately, under the guise of fighting
terror, some governments are pursuing other agendas. Our concern is that
this may provide cover to many governments to get rid of their
opponents."</TE>
<TE>Insulting Mugabe May Be Outlawed</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 20, the Cuban legislature, with President Fidel Castro
presiding, unanimously passed a law that state media said expanded the
application of capital punishment for crimes defined as terrorism,
including the use of the Internet to incite political violence.</TE>
<TE>   A week earlier, the government of Zimbabwe published a proposed law
that would make it a crime to "undermine the authority of or insult"
President Robert Mugabe, who is again seeking reelection. Mugabe's aides
defended the legislation as necessary to combat terrorists, a category
they said includes most of the president's opponents as well as critical
journalists.</TE>
<TE>   "We agree with President Bush that anyone who harbors, finances or
defends a terrorist is himself a terrorist," a presidential spokesman
said.</TE>
<TE>   In Central Asia, the government of Uzbekistan has defended its jailing
of moderate Islamist opponents as part of the world campaign against
"evildoers," while Kyrgyzstan has intensified internal travel controls on
dissidents.</TE>
<TE>   The trend to toughen statutes aimed primarily at domestic dissent
worries advocates such as Michael Posner, executive director of the New
York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to see repeated examples of governments using the new
security environment as a pretext for silencing dissidents," he said.
"This gives a green light to the Mugabes of the world to go after their
opponents under the cover of what the U.S. and the U.K. are doing" to
fight terror.</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of the Security Council's counterterrorism committee,
British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, has agreed to Ndiaye's request that
he add a human rights specialist to the committee's advisors, who already
include specialists on money laundering and intelligence gathering. But
the council's priority is to combat terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "The counterterrorism committee is not going to be the tool to resolve
human rights problems around the world," said a European official at the
committee who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N.'s own human rights advocates are limited to an advisory role
in Security Council proceedings, noted Ndiaye, the New York deputy of
Mary Robinson, the Geneva-based U.N. high commissioner for human rights.
She in turn reports to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, a former president of Ireland, is viewed with suspicion in
Washington, Moscow and Beijing because of liberal stands that are widely
admired by human rights activists. Russia and China have publicly
interpreted the Security Council's counterterror push as an endorsement
of their own armed campaigns against Muslim rebels, which have drawn
strong criticism at U.N. human rights forums.</TE>
<TE>   By the midnight deadline Thursday, more than 100 of the U.N.'s 189
member states had filed their replies to the council, and most of the
rest pledged to submit responses when the U.N. resumes sessions early
this month. The published responses range from long catalogs of efforts
to disrupt terrorist networks to cursory reiterations of official policy.</TE>
<TE>A Two-Page Memo From Venezuela</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. report, which American officials say was intended as a
"template" for other countries, runs 23 pages. Venezuela, which has been
accused of sheltering Colombian terrorists, sent a two-page memo pledging
cooperation with the council and summarizing its long-standing
international treaty commitments. The hard-line military regime in
Myanmar, in an equally terse submission, depicted itself as a victim of
global terrorism, citing last year's occupation of its embassy in
Bangkok, Thailand, by dissidents it labeled "expatriate terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Within Myanmar itself, however, "there are no terrorists," the
government assured the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first Middle Eastern submissions came from Syria, which is
poised to join the council for a two-year term this month. The Syrian
response makes a virtue of Syria's strict controls over both the economy
and the political system, contending that financial support for
terrorists is effectively curtailed by the absence of any private banking
system or independent charities. The Syrians cite as a further deterrent
their "harsh penalties" for threats to the public order, including
capital punishment for such offenses as the "disruption of means of
information, communications or transport."</TE>
<TE>   The United States still officially calls Syria a terrorist state
because of its backing of Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon and
because of Damascus' history as a haven for Islamic Jihad and other
militant Palestinian factions. Syria asserted in its report that although
it has ratified several regional and international conventions against
terrorism, the "legitimate struggle against foreign occupation" does not
fall under the definition of terrorism in these treaties. Syria, which
does not recognize Israel, condones armed attacks by Palestinians within
Israel's borders as well as in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli and Palestinian diplomats said in interviews that the U.N.
counterterror push has already blunted outside criticism of methods used
on both sides to combat accused terrorists, including preventive
detention and restrictions on speech and assembly. The Israeli submission
to the Security Council cites laws on the books since Israel's founding
that impose fines and jail time for "propaganda speeches" on behalf of
terrorists or the possession of literature published by such groups. For
decades, civil libertarians in Israel have urged that these statutes be
rescinded.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign condemnation of Israel's "extrajudicial killings" of accused
terrorists has been muted since September, said Yehuda Lancry, Israel's
U.N. representative.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials say that although they have come under intense
criticism for arresting dissidents without charges or published evidence,
the pressure on the Palestinian Authority to stop terror attacks has now
relegated such concerns to the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "The atmosphere everywhere has changed since Sept. 11," said Nasser
Kidwa, the permanent Palestinian observer at the U.N. "The American
people themselves are saying, 'Forget about due process, we want to stop
terrorism,' and you are hearing things that would have been unmentionable
here before, like military tribunals."</TE>
<TE>   The prospective American military tribunals, though perhaps the single
most significant change in U.S. counterterror policies since Sept. 11,
are notably not highlighted in the report submitted by the U.S.
government to the Security Council last month. Yet the tribunals'
ultimate impact on regimes elsewhere might be greater than any other
counterterror initiative by council members, human rights activists say.</TE>
<TE>   In a joint letter to Bush early last month, eight leading American
human rights groups said his order authorizing the tribunals--which could
impose the death penalty--will be cited by foreign dictators "for decades
to come" as a justification for summary executions.</TE>
<TE>   "The credibility and effectiveness of the United States in opposing
such repressive procedures will be seriously harmed by this precedent,"
the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, in an embarrassment to the State Department, was
voted off the Human Rights Commission in Geneva last year. The U.S. is
expected to reclaim a seat on the commission when it reconvenes in March,
but human rights groups that strongly supported U.S. membership say they
are now concerned that Washington will be a less aggressive advocate for
judicial reform and the protection of dissent.</TE>
<TE>   "The State Department's last annual human rights report was filled
with critical references to due-process concerns in places like Colombia,
Egypt and Turkey," said the Lawyers Committee's Posner. "Whether they are
going to be able to say all that again without subjecting themselves to
ridicule is an open question."</TE>
<TE>   U.N. human rights officials say they are also concerned that the
counterterror focus could pose problems for U.N. efforts to encourage
independent judiciaries and free election environments in violence-racked
societies such as East Timor, Sierra Leone, the Yugoslav region of Kosovo
and--in the coming year--Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "'The terrorists pose a threat to both security and human rights, and
many countries may, and rightly, resort to exceptional measures," said
Ndiaye, a burly, soft-spoken Senegalese lawyer and former Amnesty
International official. "But even after 9/11, defendants still deserve a
fair trial, and a government's opponents still have the right of speech
and assembly. These should not be restricted. If you do, you are
undermining the very reason that you are fighting against them."</TE>

<HD>Congress Picks New President for Argentina</HD>
<DH>S. America: Senator will be sworn in today for a two-year term and
is expected to quickly lay out a plan to quell economic turmoil. Street
violence continues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>With Argentina teetering on the brink of anarchy, a congressional
alliance of major parties moved with rare cohesion Tuesday and named Sen.
Eduardo Duhalde as the nation's fifth president in less than two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Duhalde was nominated to the office Tuesday by his Peronist party,
which controls both houses of Congress. He was elected late Tuesday at a
combined session of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies by an overwhelming
vote of 262 to 21, with 18 abstentions.</LD>
<LD>   In a bid to restore stability in a nation jolted by mass
demonstrations, rioting and a leadership crisis, Duhalde was given a
two-year term. He will be sworn in today.</LD>
<TE>   Duhalde received support from the Radical and Frepaso parties, which
in turn are expected to receive seats in his new Cabinet. Most of
Argentina's provincial governors also huddled here Tuesday, negotiating
terms of their support.</TE>
<TE>   The final vote was all but a formality after legislators formed a New
Year's Day consensus around Duhalde. The urgency of the situation was
underscored by clashes during the day among thousands of political
partisans outside the congressional palace as senators and deputies
deliberated inside. Police used tear gas to break up the melees.</TE>
<TE>   There were those who refused to jump on the Duhalde bandwagon,
insisting that elections be held in early March as announced after the
Dec. 20 resignation of President Fernando de la Rua. One such holdout was
Jose Manuel de la Sota, influential governor of Cordoba province and a
presidential candidate.</TE>
<TE>   But Congress apparently feared that the political weakness in the
government and the chaos in the streets--which marked the weeklong rule
of one of De la Rua's successors, interim President Adolfo Rodriguez
Saa--would continue under another short-term caretaker government.
Rodriguez resigned Sunday following demonstrations against his economic
proposals and his Cabinet appointees, some of whom were tainted by
corruption charges.</TE>
<TE>   "Duhalde is our only alternative. After that, the precipice," said
Alejandro Groh, an office worker who demonstrated in front of Congress on
Tuesday in favor of the 60-year-old Peronist senator, who served two
terms as governor of Buenos Aires province.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina has been slowly bowing under the weight of a crushing
foreign debt, a four-year recession, rising unemployment and mounting
public disaffection with its leaders. An outburst of rioting forced the
resignation of De la Rua two years into his four-year term. The protests
have drawn middle-class citizens who took to the streets clanging pots
and pans.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez had proposed defaulting on Argentina's $132-billion debt and
introducing a new currency in addition to the existing peso, a move that
economists warned would lead to hyperinflation.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde's economic plans were not clear Tuesday night and were said to
be a subject of negotiations among the various congressional parties. He
is expected to lay out a recovery package this week. His supporters have
dubbed his administration the "National Salvation Government."</TE>
<TE>   Abel Viglione of the Fiel think tank here believes Duhalde will
continue Rodriguez's "posture" of favoring a default on some if not all
of Argentina's public debt, since he ran on such a platform in the 1999
presidential election. Duhalde finished second in the contest to De la
Rua.</TE>
<TE>   Peronist Deputy Carlos R. Brown, who is close to Duhalde, said the
incoming president will introduce a new currency but "with care and not
as a devaluation in disguise." The peso is now pegged to the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Several sources said they expect Duhalde to reject the idea of a new
currency in favor of issuing about $3 billion in short-term vouchers with
which the government would pay public employees a portion of their
salaries, adding liquidity to Argentina's shrinking economy.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was to have served until a March presidential election. His
brief term was a compromise among fiercely competing interests seeking
power in the aftermath of De la Rua's resignation. Former President
Carlos Menem has already announced that he will run for the presidency in
2003.</TE>
<TE>   But Rodriguez's rapid exit taught Congress that a new president should
have more time to impose a recovery plan, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   "With the nation in the current crisis, we don't have the luxury of
changing presidents every 60 days," Brown said. "It's an imperative that
the new president have the power and the majority to put his program in
place and see it through."</TE>
<TE>   How Argentines at large will accept Duhalde, who was vice president
from 1989 to 1991, remains to be seen. His two terms as governor of
Buenos Aires province were tainted with charges of corruption. But he was
elected to the Senate in October by a large majority.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde will serve out the remainder of De la Rua's term, which was
scheduled to end Dec. 10, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "The experience of the last 10 days has showed us that we can't wait
to give a president the power to take the measures needed," said a staff
worker for the Radical party, one of Argentina's largest opposition
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Dario Alessandro, chief of the Frepaso party, said in a statement
throwing the group's support behind Duhalde that the current situation
makes it "necessary to find an institutional solution to the problems
that affect our country."</TE>
<TE>   Since Dec. 21, two members of Congress also served--very briefly and
reluctantly--as president in addition to Rodriguez. Senate leader Ramon
Puerta inherited the job when De la Rua quit, and Chamber of Deputies
leader Eduardo Camano took office after Rodriguez resigned. However, both
made it clear that an extended term did not appeal to them.</TE>

<HD>Battling Islamic 'Puritans'</HD>
<DH>UCLA professor, once a fanatic himself, is now a leading scholarly
voice against intolerance among Muslims. Death threats don't deter him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES RELIGION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most incendiary Muslim in American academia knows a thing or
two about Islamic fanatics. He says he used to be one as a seventh-grader
in his native Kuwait.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA law professor Khaled Abou El Fadl remembers beating up other
kids, condemning his parents as unbelievers and destroying his sister's
Rod Stewart tape, "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?"</LD>
<LD>   "I found it remarkably empowering to spew my hatred with the banner of
God in my hand," he says.</LD>
<TE>   But challenged by his father to take up true religious scholarship,
Abou El Fadl began a journey of Islamic learning that would transform him
into a nemesis of the extremists he once endorsed. Today, at 38, he is a
leading warrior in the intellectual struggle that exploded into America's
consciousness Sept. 11: Who speaks for Islam? Who defines it?</TE>
<TE>   With breathtaking bluntness, Abou El Fadl attacks Muslims who promote
a strict, literalist trend in Islam, most prominently the creed of
Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   In his writings and through the electronic media, he accuses them of
an "intolerant puritanism" that values ritual over morality. He blames
them for oppressing millions of women, creating hostility toward
non-Muslims and giving the likes of Osama bin Laden their theological
justification for terrorism. He issues scathing critiques of Saudi legal
rulings that permit everything from the mistreatment of dogs to the
beating of women.</TE>
<TE>   For tackling the puritans in high-profile forums, Abou El Fadl has
received so many death threats that new security systems are going up
around his office and home. His books are banned in Saudi Arabia and his
visa applications denied in Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, his daily battles would have been dismissed by
outsiders as esoteric doctrinal debates. Today they are better understood
as critical insights into the fierce ideological tensions raging within
Islam between the forces of puritanism and moderation. They shed light on
how Islam can produce such chilling extremists as Bin Laden, who exults
in the carnage of Sept. 11 as "blessed strikes."</TE>
<TE>   By devoting himself to a modern interpretation of the Koran, Abou El
Fadl is perhaps the most articulate enemy of the Wahhabi creed that
shaped Bin Laden's brand of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "The supremacist creed of the puritan groups is distinctive and
uniquely dangerous," the scholar recently wrote in the influential Boston
Review. "They do not merely seek self-empowerment, but aggressively seek
to disempower, dominate or destroy others."</TE>
<TE>   To many muftis, ayatollahs, sheiks and their followers throughout the
world, Abou El Fadl has become "America's most dangerous corrupter of
Islam," as one foe put it.</TE>
<TE>   One international network of students claims credit for successfully
working to blacklist him from most Islamic conferences and publications
under the banner of protecting "the one and only true Islam."</TE>
<TE>   Wahhabism's founder, 18th century evangelist Muhammad ibn 'Abd
al-Wahhab, was alarmed by what he viewed as corruptions to the faith. He
advocated a strict, back-to-basics approach to keep Islam as pure as the
day it was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad and practiced by his early
companions nearly 1,400 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Wahhabism had long been a marginal force in Islam. Abou El Fadl
asserts that it has risen in prominence in the last three decades because
of the collapse of Islamic institutions after colonialism, creating a
vacuum of authority that puritans, backed by Saudi petrodollars, rushed
to fill.</TE>
<TE>   Today's puritans advocate strict gender roles and perpetual guarding
against what they view as heretical innovations--be they new
interpretations of the faith by scholars such as Abou El Fadl or other
expressions of Islam, such as mystical Sufism or the Shiite branch of the
faith.</TE>
<TE>   Many followers of Wahhab describe their approach benevolently, merely
as "monotheism without the frills," as one member of the Saudi-financed
King Fahd Mosque in Culver City put it.</TE>
<TE>   Abou El Fadl, however, says extremists have used Wahhabism to justify
sometimes violent intolerance--massacres of Sufis and Shiite, for
instance--or hostility to non-Muslim "infidels" that has bred terrorist
acts.</TE>
<TE>   Many Muslims see an even more pervasive impact of puritanism--robbing
Islam of its richness and flexibility. Howard University professor
Sulayman Nyang calls it "the mummification, ossification and
fossilization of Islam."</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these groups we call fundamentalists have a rigid idea that
everything is sealed in concrete and there is no elasticity in
reinterpretation," says Nyang, an African-born professor of African and
Islamic studies. "We need to inject life back into Islam and open it up
in light of new realities."</TE>
<TE>   In that pursuit, Nyang says, Abou El Fadl "is blazing a new trail."</TE>
<TE>   Other Muslim intellectuals trying to reclaim their faith's rich legacy
of tolerance and compassion have also suffered for it.</TE>
<TE>   Abdulaziz Sachedina at the University of Virginia says his liberal
views on women and pluralism provoked a 1998 fatwa, or religious edict,
from an Iraqi ayatollah that resulted in some Islamic centers in the
United States banning his appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Ebrahim Moosa, an associate professor of Islamic studies at Duke
University, says his South African home was bombed by puritans in 1998
because of his activism promoting religious, racial and gender equality.</TE>
<TE>   But it is Abou El Fadl who appears to pose the greatest threat to the
puritanical view of Islam because he promotes his competing vision with
an erudition and persuasive prose that even his foes grudgingly
acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Fajrul Din, a student in Saudi Arabia who belongs to the international
student group that opposes Abou El Fadl, ticks off the scholar's sins:
defending infidels against Muslims in court; befriending Shiite, Jews and
Bahais; embracing music; owning devilish black dogs; and sheltering wives
fleeing from the "discipline" of husbands.</TE>
<TE>   What makes Abou El Fadl such a master of pandering to Western liberal
sensitivities, Din wrote in an e-mail, is that "with each of these
heretical views, he weaves sweet words like a serpent, and misleads the
naive and simple. His sin is greater than any other. He studied and saw
the light, but chose to turn away from it. We will not dirty our hands by
touching him, but let him perish like a dog among the heathens he loves
so much."</TE>
<TE>Dogs and Books as Symbols of His Effort</TE>
<TE>   The man at the center of this ideological furor is physically
unimposing, with a short, stocky frame, light brown eyes and olive skin.
His home is dominated by two elements that symbolize much about Islam's
ideological tensions today: dogs and books.</TE>
<TE>   Abou El Fadl loves to use dogs to illustrate what he regards as the
puritans' willful ignorance of Islamic tradition and an oppressive
emphasis on law over morality.</TE>
<TE>   In much of the Muslim world, dogs are decidedly not man's best friend.
Abou El Fadl says he was taught that they were impure and that black dogs
in particular were evil.</TE>
<TE>   Religious traditions hold that if a dog--or woman--passes in front of
you as you prepare to pray, it pollutes your purity and negates your
prayer. Dogs are permissible as watchdogs or for other utilitarian
purposes, but not simply for companionship. Abou El Fadl says this
zealous adherence to doctrine led one religious authority to advise a
Muslim that his pet dog was evil and should be driven away by cutting off
its food and water.</TE>
<TE>   Many Muslims say this caution toward dogs is fundamentally a matter of
hygiene. Many devout Muslims follow such rules without question, for
submission to God is Islam's highest call whether the reasons for divine
law are apparent or not, according to Sheik Tajuddin B. Shuaib of the
King Fahd Mosque.</TE>
<TE>   But Abou El Fadl prides himself on questioning just about everything.
He could not fathom a God who would condemn such loving, loyal creatures.
So about five years ago he set out to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   After a lengthy process of textual research and prayer for divine
guidance, he concluded that reports against dogs were passed on through
questionable chains of transmissions, or contradicted by more favorable
reports--for instance, one story of Muhammad praying with his dogs
playing nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Some reports against dogs bear uncanny similarities to Arab folklore,
Abou El Fadl says, leading him to suspect that someone took the tales and
attributed them to the prophet.</TE>
<TE>   As Abou El Fadl speaks, Honey snoozes near his side. The yellow cocker
spaniel mix was abandoned by its owners and was cowering in the corner of
an animal shelter, dirty and racked by seizures, when the scholar and his
wife rescued him.</TE>
<TE>   They also rescued Baby, a black shepherd a day away from being killed,
and Calbee, an abused dog who smelled of garbage for a year and still
feels secure only when curled up inside a plastic laundry basket.</TE>
<TE>   "Dogs represent my rebellion against ignorance about the basis of
actual historical law," Abou El Fadl says. "They are a symbol of the
irrationality of our tradition, the privileging of law over humaneness."</TE>
<TE>   How, he asks, pointing to Honey, who constantly follows him and
nestles at his side, does God "create animals with these natural
tendencies and then condemn them as thoroughly reprehensible?"</TE>
<TE>A Male Feminist Who Cites Tradition</TE>
<TE>   In the same audacious manner, he is a leading Muslim feminist,
challenging puritanical positions that women must be fully veiled and
obey their husbands without question or submit to beatings for
disobedience. He even urges his wife, Grace, to lead him in prayer,
challenging prevailing Muslim practice of all-male religious leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Most troubling to his ideological enemies, Abou El Fadl cannot be
written off as a Westernized "Uncle Tom," a term puritans use to dismiss
American Muslims with similar open views. His work is painstakingly
grounded in classical Islamic sources, they acknowledge, giving him the
ability to defend his modern interpretations with a dizzying command of
ancient traditions.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in a book published this year challenging Saudi legal
rulings on women--barring them from freely wearing bras or high heels,
for instance--Abou El Fadl read 350 sources, some of them ancient Islamic
texts that are virtually impenetrable to the untrained Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   His book, "Speaking in God's Name," has outraged puritans, prompting
Din's international student group to declare that it will organize
demonstrations against the work in London and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   But to fans such as Asma Gull Hasan, author of "American Muslims: The
New Generation," Abou El Fadl gives feminists like her the courage and
intellectual firepower to resist what she calls the growing influence of
puritans in mosques and on college campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "They are making Islam a religion of shame, guilt and oppression,"
says Hasan, 25, bemoaning puritan exhortations to avoid non-Muslims, MTV
and, for women, uncovered heads. "Without someone of Khaled's caliber to
speak out against them, many more Muslims would feel we have to accept
their positions, and we might turn away from the religion."</TE>
<TE>   Abou El Fadl has also worked with international human rights groups,
blowing the whistle on such practices as the widespread rape of Southeast
Asian maids in Muslim countries throughout the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   He has helped document abuses in Sudan, Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, Israel,
Algeria, Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. As a result, he says, he can no
longer travel to Egypt, even as his relatives are aging and asking to see
him to say a last goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   As a lawyer in the United States, he has taken on highly sensitive
cases, such as a suit against an American Muslim leader's son for leaving
a woman pregnant and in debt in apparent violation of an oral marriage
contract. And he frequently serves as an expert witness to help victims
of religious persecution obtain political asylum here.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, he took the witness stand in the Los Angeles
courtroom of federal immigration-law Judge Richard D. Walton. Wagih
Wadie, an Egyptian bank teller and member of the Coptic Christian church,
was seeking political asylum, telling the judge he was tortured by
Egyptian security police on trumped-up charges of defaming Islam and
causing fitna, or national disunity, last year. His only crime, Wadie
asserted, was offending an influential Muslim by refusing to cash his
check.</TE>
<TE>   When Abou El Fadl took the stand, he testified about the Egyptian
government's record of torture and the plausibility of the petitioner's
fears of persecution. Walton granted asylum.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know any other Muslim who sticks his neck out like he does,"
says Wadie's attorney, Roni Deutsch. He says Abou El Fadl's testimony is
so authoritative that it nearly always clinches court victories, yet
comes either free or at just a fraction of the $500 hourly going rate.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anybody who does what he does in any religion. He
doesn't have an agenda. He does this because he believes it is right."</TE>
<TE>   Abou El Fadl says he does this, in part, because he has been on the
other side. He says he was persecuted by security forces in the Mideast
in the 1980s after writing pro-democracy articles and poems. (He asks
that the name of the country not be printed for fear of retribution
against relatives.) Advised to flee, he stood in line at the U.S. Embassy
praying for a student visa.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a promise to God that if you allow me to be where I can speak
without fear, I will never shut up," he says. "Now it's been 20 years,
and I've kept my bargain."</TE>
<TE>A Cocky Boy Learns to Overcome Arrogance</TE>
<TE>   Abou El Fadl is physically frail, popping 36 pills a day for maladies
ranging from osteoporosis to asthma. He speaks in a soft voice and
sometimes avoids direct eye contact. He can boyishly haul his family to
video arcades to shoot down zombies in "House of the Dead." He is the
quintessential absent-minded professor who doesn't drive, can't remember
his address, took two years to learn his phone number and once wore his
son's pint-sized tie to class, vaguely wondering why students kept
grinning.</TE>
<TE>   All this belies an extravagant overachiever.</TE>
<TE>   He memorized the Koran at age 12, but says his real learning began
after his rebellion against his parents as a seventh-grader.</TE>
<TE>   His father, a lawyer from a family with a long tradition of Islamic
learning, challenged his cocky son to test his expertise in a religion
class at a local mosque. The class was on shariah, Islamic law, taught
Socratic-style, and Abou El Fadl says the other students--both girls and
boys--demolished him. Crushed, he ran home, dived under his bed and
cried.</TE>
<TE>   "Is the solution for you to cry? Or learn?" his father admonished him.
"If anyone can learn it is you. Your only stupidity is your arrogance."</TE>
<TE>   For the next decade, Abou El Fadl spent four hours each day after
school, all weekend and every summer in Egypt learning the Islamic
classics at the feet of such celebrated sheiks as Muhammad Al-Ghazali, a
world-renowned proponent of moderate Islamic revivalism.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke broken English when he arrived at Yale in 1982. Four years
later, he graduated magna cum laude and won the prestigious Scholar of
the House award for exceptionally gifted students.</TE>
<TE>   Next was a law degree in 1989 from the University of Pennsylvania and
a first-place award in the national Jessup Moot Court Competition. He
clerked for the Arizona Supreme Court and worked in commercial and
immigration law. He became a naturalized American citizen.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, he completed his doctorate in Islamic law at Princeton, where
he earned a perfect grade point average, nabbed a prestigious writing
award and won Best Dissertation for a paper on "Rebellion and Violence in
Islamic Law."</TE>
<TE>   Abou El Fadl was teaching at the University of Texas in Austin when
Irene Bierman of UCLA's Center for Near Eastern Studies went to scout him
out in 1998 for a new chair in Islamic law. Bierman says his chief
attraction was his rare combination of a doctorate and a law degree,
Western and Islamic training, legal experience and prolific academic
scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   To Muslim philanthropists Omar and Esmeralda Alfi, who have pledged a
$1-million endowment to finance the chair, Abou El Fadl presented the
perfect candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "People say there is a conflict between modernity and tradition, but
Khaled is able to get the most liberal thoughts from a very old tradition
because of his deep knowledge and the awesome amount of reading he does,"
Esmeralda Alfi says.</TE>
<TE>Library Illustrates Vast Traditions</TE>
<TE>   Abou El Fadl's most important weapon is books. They line the walls of
his home, fill an entire room on the second floor and spill out into
another detached room outside. His annual book budget is more than
$60,000. His entire collection surpasses 40,000 volumes on law, theology,
sociology, philosophy, history, literature.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Afaf El Nimr, says her eldest son was drawn to the written
word from the time he was 3, every day spreading out the newspaper and
studying it in deep concentration.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was 9, he had begun reading his father's tomes on
Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt and Indian nationalist leader
Jawaharlal Nehru. Young Khaled would sell off his underwear to raise
money for more books, according to his mother.</TE>
<TE>   The 10,000 volumes in his Islamic law library illustrate the vastness
of the faith's traditions--and some of its problems. The collection, some
of its items eight centuries old, includes writings from every school of
thought in the majority Sunni and minority Shiite traditions, some
extinct. They run the gamut from works by Muslims whom Abou El Fadl
reveres, such as the 11th century Baghdad jurist Ibn 'Aqil, to those by
writers he abhors, such as Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind sheik serving a
life sentence in connection with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine how many intellects are deposited in here," he says, "how
many glimpses of perception."</TE>
<TE>   He agonizes over a rising tide of censorship. He blames it directly on
the 1970s rise in oil prices that gave Saudi Arabia the financial
resources to control the Islamic book market and propagate the nation's
puritan creed.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent trip to an Arabic bookstore in Anaheim, he pointed out
numerous books banned in the Mideast, including such classics as "1001
Nights" and other books on theories of human rights, homosexuality and
Islam, and a treatise on Sufism.</TE>
<TE>   Abou El Fadl's own books--he published four in just the last year--are
banned in Saudi Arabia, although Din of the opposition student group says
bootleg translations are making the rounds in Medina and scandalizing
devout Muslims there.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Abou El Fadl says, puritan Muslims have even begun cleansing
the sacred texts of passages they deem offensive. He exposes the practice
in an essay, "Corrupting God's Book," citing as one example a popular
English translation of the Koran, widely distributed in the United
States, that he says skews the Arabic text to claim women must cover
their entire body except for one or both eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "The agony of the Muslim plight in the modern world cannot be
expressed either in words or tears," Abou El Fadl writes in the piece,
published this year in a collection of critical essays titled "Conference
of the Books." "What can one say about those people who, in their utter
ignorance and maniacal arrogance, subjugate even the word of God to
ugliness and deformities?"</TE>
<TE>   Some Muslims are offended by such searing self-criticism, believing
that it only aids enemies of Islam. Others, such as University of
Michigan Islamic studies professor S. Abdal-Hakim Jackson, say Abou El
Fadl's boldness is needed, but they worry that it alienates the very
audience the scholar is trying to reform. Still others embrace the candor
as a sign of the Muslim community's maturity.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be confident in your place in society to begin airing
your dirty laundry," says Rick St. John, a Muslim convert and Los Angeles
attorney who believes that Abou El Fadl is "trying to improve the
religion and return it to something better and beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   On his good days, such comments encourage Abou El Fadl to believe that
he is making a difference. On his bad days, when he encounters death
threats, back-stabbing, censorship or indifference from his fellow
Muslims, he is plaintive in his pain.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so lonely," he blurted out one night. "God gave me this
affliction of law. I learned all of it, and there is nothing I can do
with it, and if I don't preserve it, it will die."</TE>
<TE>   He needs to pray. It is 1:25 a.m. In the darkened silence, for more
than an hour, he offers supplication to his creator, moving his lips in
silent worship. Then he rises. He kisses the Koran, touches it to his
forehead and lets out a soft whisper.</TE>
<TE>   "And everything looks beautiful again."</TE>

Adherents, who object to the terms Wahhabism and Wahhabi, say they
observe the "one true Islam." They are hostile to the intercession of
saints, visiting tombs of saints, Sufism, Shiite Muslims and rational
methods of deducing law. The creed dominates in Saudi Arabia.</TE>

<HD>Feeding the Masses--and Souls--in N.Y.</HD>
<DH>Aftermath: Nino's is a comfort zone for the workers at the trade
center site. Volunteers compete for shifts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>If Nino's Restaurant ever inspires a sitcom--and somebody's
probably pitching the idea right now--it already has the perfect cast.</LD>
<LD>   There's Chris Craven, the New York City fireman with the wind-reddened
cheeks and wise-guy smirk.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey captain, wanna save your hair?" he yelled to a balding comrade.
"Get a shoe box!"</LD>
<TE>   And Debbie Mendel, the advertising executive who almost fell for a
cop.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have never gone out with a stranger before," she said. "But I
met him at Nino's and thought: 'Why not?' "</TE>
<TE>   There's Sister Michele Dougherty, a Roman Catholic nun from
Pennsylvania who beamed beatifically, blue eyes blazing under a black
habit, as she scooped fruit salad onto paper plates.</TE>
<TE>   And little Faith Stephens, from Fredericksburg, Texas, who sings
heart-stirring songs with white-feathered wings on her back.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wanted to change the world," said the 8-year-old, whose
mother dressed her as an angel. "Now I get my chance."</TE>
<TE>   If there's any place in New York where people act just like they
should, it's Nino's, an Italian restaurant converted into a cheery soup
kitchen for workers from the World Trade Center site.</TE>
<TE>   The pizza and spaghetti joint has become a refuge, a reprieve, a
comfort zone to digest the magnitude of Sept. 11--and some great food--at
a safe distance from the site (about a mile away).</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny here," explained National Guardsman Tim Elnahas, who
patrols the nearby Brooklyn Bridge. "There's no edge. Everybody's so
nice."</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Nino Vendome, a 49-year-old Italian immigrant, closed his
doors to the public Sept. 12 and began serving free meals to
firefighters, police officers, soldiers, Red Cross workers and anyone
else working at the site.</TE>
<TE>   Three and a half months later, the grim recovery work continues--and
so does Nino's, which has dished out 500,000 meals and counting.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteers begin lining up as early as 9:30 a.m., huddled along
Canal Street, hands in their pockets, backs to the icy wind that blasts
through lower Manhattan. Helping out at Nino's has become such the "in"
thing that weekend shifts are booked weeks in advance.</TE>
<TE>   They come from all over--Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, Los Angeles,
even Paris and Tokyo-- some dressed in crisp new Yankees caps and "United
we stand" T-shirts with creases still in them.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Chakmakjian, who lives in nearby Westchester, signed up his
family for a double shift because "it's good for us to connect, in a real
way, to what happened."</TE>
<TE>   He got put in the kitchen, chopping rock-hard squash, while his
19-year-old son mopped the floors and his wife ran the cocoa machine.</TE>
<TE>   Each day the restaurant is staffed by 30 paid workers, funded by
donations, and a squad of 120 volunteers who do everything from cooking,
cleaning and serving to soliciting donations on the sidewalk and
counseling exhausted rescue workers.</TE>
<TE>   The World Trade Center workers, who have some of the toughest jobs in
America right now, spend 12-hour shifts in freezing weather combing the
rubble of the towers for charred bones or other human remains. They often
drift into the restaurant in quiet packs, their faces fixed in some sort
of "automatic" mode, their jackets smelling of smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "I found a watch the other day--still ticking," Bronx firefighter Paul
DeLeo said. "It was weird."</TE>
<TE>   By lunchtime, Nino's, with 1,100 square feet of eating space, begins
to get crowded as officers, firefighters, soldiers and relief workers sit
elbow to elbow at long tables covered in white vinyl. Almost every inch
of wall space is papered with well-wishing cards, including one that read
"Sorry about what happened" taped on the bathroom wall.</TE>
<TE>   But Nino's is not like a hospital ward where the cheeriness seems
forced or depressing. It's a social place, boisterous, busy, noisy and
fun. It has even developed a reputation as a singles' spot, where
volunteers, many of them young women, have the opportunity to mingle with
police officers and firefighters. There's a mix of melancholy and
flirtation in the air, and at a time like this, a lot of people are
looking to connect.</TE>
<TE>   "I see people getting numbers all the time," said Mike Coulston, a New
York lawyer. "I tell my wife, 'Whoa, honey, make sure those guys see that
ring.' "</TE>
<TE>   There's a little lull after lunch, filled by banging pots and sizzling
pans as dinner is prepared.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the volunteers in the kitchen are quite talented, like one
chef from Carmel who flew in with his own set of knives.</TE>
<TE>   Though the place is run like a soup kitchen, don't picture steaming
bowls of chili or blocks of government cheese. Nino's has gone upscale.
Recent meals included seafood lasagna and venison. "A lot of guys had
never seen that before," manager Gerald Postigilione said.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, it quiets down, though the place never closes. It's open
24 hours a day, seven days a week. And Vendome plans to keep it that way
as long as it's needed.</TE>
<TE>   Late at night, the vibe is more solemn. The mix tends to be fewer cops
and more rescue workers who arrive straight from the site, shivering
cold.</TE>
<TE>   A bright spot is when the angels come. The Stephens family, seven
children ages 2 to 18 and two beaming parents, traveled 1,800 miles from
Texas to spend the holidays in New York singing carols at Nino's and
several firehouses. They sold reindeer pins to pay for their travel
expenses and winged costumes.</TE>
<TE>   The nasty weather and the bleak recovery work swirls out of focus for
a moment when the children shuffle to the front of the clattering
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone stops: the soldier guarding the Brooklyn Bridge, the police
officer at ground zero, the firefighter who's been sifting through debris
all day, every day.</TE>
<TE>   "Come on, sing us a good one!" someone yells.</TE>
<TE>   And then little Faith Stephens steps upon a chair, brushes her hair
from her face and belts out one more.</TE>

<HD>Anthrax Tests Hint at Success</HD>
<DH>Contamination: Senate offices tainted by a letter to Sen. Daschle
appear to have been cleaned, the EPA says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The poisonous gas pumped into the Hart Senate Office Building last
weekend appears to have killed any remaining anthrax spores,
Environmental Protection Agency officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The agency must await lab tests to confirm the preliminary results,
but monitoring equipment suggested that the fumigation worked on the
second try. An earlier attempt failed when officials could not create the
necessary levels of humidity.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel very comfortable that we had a very successful fumigation,"
said Richard Rupert, the EPA's on-scene coordinator. "We feel that, based
on the humidity numbers, the temperature and the concentration of
chlorine dioxide, we were able to effectively destroy any anthrax
spores."</LD>
<TE>   Technicians under the agency's direction began pumping chlorine
dioxide gas into the heating and ventilation system of the southeast
quadrant of the building at 9 a.m. Friday. The process was completed at
4:30 a.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The quadrant had tested positive for anthrax spores after the earlier
fumigation effort. The building, where half the 100 senators have their
offices, closed Oct. 17, two days after an aide to Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) opened an anthrax-tainted letter.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle said Sunday that there is a reasonable possibility the
building will reopen this month.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are waiting for results, possibly later this week, on two
types of laboratory tests.</TE>
<TE>   One analysis is underway on more than 400 Band-Aid-size strips that
will disclose the results of the fumigation. Separate tests are checking
samples taken by swabbing and vacuuming surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   The test strips contain bacteria more resistant to the gas fumigation
than anthrax. If that bacteria is found dead, it will suggest that any
remaining anthrax is too.</TE>
<TE>   The surface samples are gathered by small vacuum cleaners with
sock-like filters that are then analyzed, by swabbing surfaces with
something similar to a Q-Tip and by wiping surfaces with a synthetic
cloth the size of a handkerchief.</TE>
<TE>   Rupert said more than 4,000 samples were taken from every room in the
Hart building.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, with a Jan. 7 deadline for inoculations approaching, fewer
than 100 people have opted to receive an anthrax vaccine out of thousands
eligible, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Of the more than 3,000 people who have sought counseling to help
decide if they need the extra therapy, more than 700 chose to take
additional antibiotics.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Confirms Marines Aiding Hunt in South</HD>
<DH>War: With Bin Laden and Taliban leader still at large, forces are
collecting information near Kandahar, an Army officer says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As the hunt for Osama bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed
Omar continued Tuesday, American defense officials confirmed that U.S.
Marines were helping with "information gathering" at a former Taliban
stronghold in southern Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The Marines have been "actively doing a search . . . in the Helmand
province west of Kandahar," while Special Forces have been working with
anti-Taliban soldiers in the region, said Army Col. Rick Thomas at the
U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla. The southern city of Kandahar was a
Taliban stronghold until it fell last month.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas said the Marines "are not going after Omar," but he declined to
offer details of the special operations activities. The Marines are
searching one of 14 sites identified as having been used by Taliban and
Al Qaeda forces, Thomas said.</LD>
<TE>   In the past couple of days, there have been several reports that Al
Qaeda forces that fled Kandahar went to the northern part of Helmand. The
reports were part of warnings to Afghans that the roads in that area are
not safe. Interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai was quoted on Radio
Afghanistan on Tuesday as saying that if Omar was in the province, he
would be captured.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post reported that a column of about 20 armored
personnel carriers, Humvees and trucks, protected by Harrier fighter jets
and helicopter gunships, ferried about 200 Marines to Helmand. The
Marines searched for documents, booklets, videotapes and other material.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, American Talib John Walker Lindh was one of eight detainees
transferred from the U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship Peleliu to the
Bataan, another assault ship in the Arabian Sea. Officials declined to
say why Walker and the others were moved.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas also said the number of Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees held by
U.S. forces has risen to 210. In addition to the eight shipboard
prisoners, there are 189 in Kandahar, 12 at Bagram and one at
Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In Kabul, Afghanistan's interim government pressed forward with
getting organized. Karzai continued the steady stream of meetings that
have been his daily life since he started the job 10 days ago. He met in
the capital with the United Nations' special representative for
Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, as well as Afghan tribal elders from
several provinces.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai will make his first official visits outside the country in the
next few weeks. He will go to the United States, India and Japan, which
is hosting a meeting of countries that are expected to contribute funds
toward the rebuilding of Afghanistan, according to a report on Radio
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Other ministries were busy. As dusk fell, Rural Affairs Minister Abdul
Malek was working late trying to draw up a budget for his agency, which
is short on staff, supplies, chairs and everything else it takes to run a
government department.</TE>
<TE>   Aid agencies kicked off an $8-million immunization program aimed at
inoculating about 9 million Afghan children against measles. The disease,
which has been virtually eradicated in developed countries, kills about
35,000 Afghan children a year, according to the United Nations Children's
Fund and the World Health Organization--two of the agencies that are
spearheading the program.</TE>
<TE>   Afghans seemed eager to participate, and throughout the day there was
a steady stream of parents bringing their children to the modest hospital
in Kabul for shots. It was the first experience with an inoculation for
many of the children.</TE>
<TE>   Another major humanitarian effort was underway at the government's
main orphanage in the capital. A private Italian television station, in
concert with the Italian Red Cross, delivered a truckload of blankets,
clothes and shoes to the nearly 1,000 children who live at the orphanage
and a sister institution for girls. Subsequent deliveries will include
food, toys, books and school supplies, said Alfredo Macchi, a
correspondent for the station, which is owned by Mediaset.</TE>
<TE>   The donations came about after Macchi broadcast a program on the
orphanage several weeks ago and received an enormous response from
Italians who wanted to help the children. The channel raised more than
$500,000 and coordinated with the Red Cross to transport the supplies and
ensure they arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Last month the orphanage received some of the nearly 45 tons of food
delivered to Afghanistan thanks to a joint effort by the New York Fire
Department, which raised money to help the Afghan children, and an
international aid agency.</TE>
<TE>   The delivery was underwritten by Diageo, a food and beverage company,
through its Spirit of America Fund.</TE>

<LD>Zacarias Moussaoui, the first man to be indicted on charges
involving the Sept. 11 attacks, is due in court today to enter a plea on
charges of conspiring with Osama bin Laden and others to murder thousands
of people.</LD>

arraigned in a U.S. federal court in Alexandria, Va., on charges set out
in a Dec. 11 indictment.</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui's lawyers have not said how he will plead, but Moussaoui
previously has said he is innocent.</LD>
<TE>   The six-count indictment includes four charges that can carry the
death penalty. The other two carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.</TE>

<HD>Texas Fights Ruling of Legal Incompetence</HD>
<DH>Law: The state asks the U.S. Supreme Court to review a murder case
reversed because the lawyer slept in court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a case that could help define competent lawyering, the state of
Texas has renewed efforts to execute a Houston man whose murder
conviction was reversed last year by a federal appeals court because his
attorney had slept through portions of the case.</LD>
<LD>   Calvin J. Burdine's 1984 trial was fundamentally unfair because of the
"consistent unconsciousness" of his court-appointed attorney, Joe Frank
Cannon, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled in
August.</LD>
<LD>   But the Texas attorney general's office recently asked the U.S.
Supreme Court to review the ruling. The justices are scheduled to vote
Friday on whether to take up the case and are expected to announce their
decision on granting review next week.</LD>
<TE>   Should the high court justices agree to consider the case, a hearing
probably would be held in the next few months. Should the justices
decline, Texas would have to retry Burdine.</TE>
<TE>   In legal papers filed with the Supreme Court, the Texas attorney
general's office contends that the 5th Circuit ruling was inconsistent
with the decisions of two other federal appeals courts on how often an
attorney can sleep during a trial without violating his client's
constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Texas state attorneys also maintain that the 5th Circuit ruling
awarding Burdine a new trial is inconsistent with earlier decisions
rejecting defendants' claims that they were entitled to a new trial
because their attorneys were alcoholic, had Alzheimer's or suffered from
attention deficit disorder.</TE>
<TE>   If the 5th Circuit decision is upheld, it "will invite countless
ineffective assistance [of counsel] claims based on any type of
intermittent 'unconsciousness' by counsel during trial," Texas Solicitor
General Julie C. Parsley wrote in her brief.</TE>
<TE>   "In Burdine's wake, imaginative . . . petitioners will parade expert
witnesses into their . . . hearings to testify that--given trial
counsel's subsequently diagnosed Alzheimer's, or bipolar condition, or
alcoholism, or attention deficit disorder--it is likely that periods of
unconsciousness occurred during trial, and therefore prejudice [to the
defendant] should be presumed," Parsley asserted.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Supreme Court held as long ago as 1932, in the Scottsboro
boys rape case, that a defendant in a capital case is entitled to "the
guiding hand of counsel at every stage of the proceeding against him,"
the high court has never ruled on whether a defendant is entitled to a
new trial because his lawyer frequently fell asleep during a trial.</TE>
<TE>   The Burdine case became nationally prominent during the 2000
presidential election. Reporters asked then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush
about the case, which to death penalty foes had become a symbol of the
troublesome way capital trials are handled in the Lone Star State. Bush
defended the state's procedures.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court has only once overturned a death sentence on the
ground that a defense lawyer provided constitutionally deficient
representation. Under a 1984 decision, Strickland vs. Washington, the
court set a very high bar for such claims. The defendant has to show that
his attorney's performance was substantially below professional norms and
that the substandard performance actually harmed his case. However, in
another case decided the same year, U.S. vs. Cronic, the Supreme Court
said there could be some circumstances in which an attorney's performance
was so deficient that it could be presumed that the client's case was
harmed.</TE>
<TE>   In its 9-5 decision in October, the 5th Circuit said the Burdine case
was just such an instance. "The buried assumption" in 5th Circuit rulings
that have applied the Strickland principles "is that counsel is present
and conscious to exercise judgment, calculation and instinct, for better
or worse. But that is an assumption we cannot make when counsel is
unconscious at critical times," Judge Fortunato P. Benavides wrote for
the majority.</TE>
<TE>   Burdine's appellate lawyer, Robert L. McGlasson, a federal public
defender in Atlanta, has asked the Supreme Court to reject Texas'
petition, maintaining that the 5th Circuit ruling was unremarkable and
quoting the ruling's statement that it was "limited to the egregious
facts" of his case.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing in such a decision to warrant review," McGlasson
wrote in his brief. The controversy has its genesis in a grisly April
1983 murder. The body of W.T. Wise, Burdine's former roommate, was found
in the bedroom of a trailer with two stab wounds in the back and the
hands tied with a cord.</TE>
<TE>   Burdine, now 48, was convicted of the murder the following year.
Burdine acknowledged that he and a friend went to the trailer to rob
Wise. However, Burdine has denied that he participated in the killing.</TE>
<TE>   Before Burdine's trial, his co-defendant, Douglas McCreight, pleaded
guilty to a lesser charge and then testified against Burdine. He was
paroled after eight years, despite evidence introduced at Burdine's trial
that indicated McCreight was the primary perpetrator of the murder.</TE>
<TE>   Burdine's conviction was upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case. Then
McGlasson challenged the constitutionality of the conviction and, after a
1995 hearing, Jay Burnett, a state court judge in Houston, recommended a
new trial because of testimony that Cannon had failed to stay awake.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Burnett relied on the statements of Rose Marie Berry,
the trial court clerk, who testified that Cannon "fell asleep for long
periods of time during the questioning of witnesses." At one point,
Cannon fell asleep "for at least 10 minutes," Berry testified.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, one juror testified at the same hearing that Cannon "would
nod his head down, bob it, with eyes closed."</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected Burnett's recommendation,
saying Burdine had not proved that his defense had been prejudiced by
Cannon's lapses. However, in 1999, David Hittner, a federal judge in
Houston, ruled that Burdine was entitled to a new trial because "a
sleeping counsel is equivalent to no counsel at all."</TE>
<TE>   A three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit reversed that decision, 2 to 1,
in October 2000, agreeing with Texas officials that, although Cannon's
performance was less than stellar, Burdine's new lawyers had not proved
that their client was harmed by Cannon's shoddy work. Ten months later,
the full 5th Circuit overturned the panel's decision by a 9-5 vote.</TE>
<TE>   Cannon, who is now dead, was frequently appointed by judges to
represent indigents in death penalty cases in Houston because he had a
reputation of processing cases rapidly. Burdine's entire murder trial
took only 13 hours of jury time. During his career, 10 of Cannon's
clients wound up on death row, second most of any lawyer in Texas. He
slept during at least one other trial; that client has been executed.</TE>
<TE>   The case at issue this week is Cockrell (director of the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice) vs. Burdine, 01-495.</TE>

<HD>N.Y.'s New Mayor Sounds Cautious Note</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Michael R. Bloomberg was sworn in as New York's 108th mayor
Tuesday, vowing to help the city recover from the World Trade Center
attacks but warning residents that tough economic times lie ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Standing in front of an enormous American flag draped across the
facade of City Hall, Bloomberg, 59, began his inaugural speech by
praising his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who got a standing ovation
from the crowd of 4,000 dignitaries. He said Giuliani had asked him "not
to fail the people of New York," and he answered to resounding cheers:
"Rudy, I will not."</LD>
<LD>   On a frigid afternoon, Bloomberg took the oath of office from Judith
Kaye, chief judge of New York's Court of Appeals, while his 92-year-old
mother, Charlotte, stood by his side. Bette Midler sang the national
anthem to open the ceremonies, and jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis played
"America the Beautiful" as the inaugural festivities ended.</LD>
<TE>   Tuesday's ceremony marked the third time that Bloomberg had been sworn
in. The first came in a private meeting with the city clerk, and the
second occurred minutes into the new year in Times Square.</TE>
<TE>   In a blunt, no-nonsense speech Tuesday afternoon, Bloomberg praised
New York's spirit. Yet he acknowledged that major fiscal cutbacks were
inevitable, given the city's looming $4.3-billion budget deficit and its
loss of about 100,000 jobs after the Sept. 11 attacks. He promised a 20%
cutback in mayoral staffing and urged other city departments to do the
same--a proposal that met with scattered boos.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not be able to afford everything we want," said the
Republican media mogul, who has never held elective office. "We will not
even be able to afford everything we have."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg told New Yorkers that "this is not a time to fight with one
another" and pledged cooperation with the federal government and New York
Gov. George Pataki as the city begins to rebuild lower Manhattan. But he
issued a pointed challenge to President Bush, who vowed several days
after the terrorist attacks that America would help rebuild New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you, Mr. President, for all you have done and all you will do
to fulfill that explicit pledge," he said. "This is a historic moment,
and we have to work together."</TE>
<TE>   The new mayor, who spent $69 million of his own money on his campaign
and whose views on many issues are still largely unknown, gave an inkling
of some controversial choices he would be making. He called for mayoral
control of the city's faltering schools, a position sure to antagonize
the Board of Education and the teachers union. He expressed only lukewarm
support for Giuliani's plan to build $800-million domed baseball stadiums
for the Yankees and Mets, saying those kind of projects could only be
launched "when we can afford them."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg's fiscal expertise was his strong suit in a mayoral contest
overshadowed by the World Trade Center attacks. The founder of Bloomberg
LP, a leader in fiscal information technology, he billed himself as a
manager who could help New York rebound economically. Many political
observers think his success will hinge on his ability to persuade
businesses to remain in Manhattan after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I urge you to stay here and strengthen your commitment to this city,"
he said in remarks directed at corporate leaders. "This is not the time
to leave the Big Apple. I want the world to know that New York is safe,
strong and open for business."</TE>

<HD>As Euro Debuts, Cashiers See Double</HD>
<DH>Money: Some vendors segregate old and new currencies, keeping two
tills to spare confusion for one more day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRANKFURT, Germany
</DL>
<LD>Clerks at the convenience store in the train station here kept two
tills open Tuesday, one for marks and the other for euros.</LD>
<LD>   Aboard the Intercity Express from this German financial capital to
Berlin, the waiter in the restaurant car polled diners about their
payment plans before taking orders, gauging his supply of the incoming
and outgoing currencies with each meal served.</LD>
<LD>   At the few other shops and services in business on this quiet New
Year's holiday, money mostly remained segregated as merchants and vendors
staved off for one more day the inevitable confusion over the new euro.</LD>
<TE>   E-Day, as the launch of the continent's common currency has been
called throughout the elaborate planning period, dawned with hardly a
hitch as citizens of the 12-nation euro zone celebrated 2002 much like
the start of any other year.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, so good," said Andreas Goralczyk, spokesman for the Federal
Assn. of German Bankers in the largest and most influential euro country.
"It appears our preparations were more than adequate."</TE>
<TE>   Resistant consumers in Italy sabotaged some automated teller machines
with chewing gum, and French bank and postal employees were threatening a
one-day strike when commerce resumes today after the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   But for the most part, the first full day for the economic bloc newly
solidified by the euro was cause for pride and enthusiasm among the
currency's users, even in countries where voters had little or no say
about surrendering their old money.</TE>
<TE>   In the Netherlands, one of the more euro-enthusiastic populations,
more than 300,000 ATM transactions were conducted in the early hours of
Tuesday as Dutch revelers took their champagne and pastry with them to
stand in line for their first look at the cash, said banking industry
spokeswoman Jannemieke Zandee.</TE>
<TE>   French television news focused on glitches at cash machines--one of
the few activities involving the euro available on the holiday. But the
French Banking Federation reported that the dispensing of the new
currency was proceeding smoothly, with more than 25 million euros
withdrawn in the first six hours.</TE>
<TE>   In Brussels--headquarters of the 15-member European Union, which the
currency is intended to more deeply integrate--officials hailed E-Day as
a quiet success: "No news is good news," said executive commission
spokesman Gerassimos Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Cash machines in some countries were shut down overnight as a
precaution against robberies. In Belgium and Ireland, consumers got their
first look at their new money after daybreak.</TE>
<TE>   In Spain, some banks opened for three hours in the middle of the day
to provide customers with a chance to obtain the currency. The gesture
was so successful that lines stretched a football field's length from the
teller counters and required more than two hours to negotiate. Most of
those taking advantage were late-night revelers just headed home from
their parties or taxi drivers and bar owners who needed money to do
business.</TE>
<TE>   The European Central Bank's strategy for disseminating the euro is
twofold: ATMs are expected to put bills in shoppers' hands before
business resumes today, and merchants are supposed to have armed
themselves with euro coins and notes ahead of time so they can give
change only in the new money.</TE>
<TE>   But workers at the eateries, newsstands and transport offices that
were among the few businesses open on New Year's Day mostly kept their
national and euro currencies separated.</TE>
<TE>   At Rome's Bar Brasile, few people were paying with euros, according to
cashier Fabio Moschini. "Pay in lire, get your change in lire. Pay in
euro, get your change in euro," he said. "I have only a little change. I
am afraid this week might be difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Geerke Netten, a visitor from the Dutch city of Leiden, said that
after paying in euros at a Roman supermarket, she was told that euro
coins had run out. "Now when I go back home, I'll be stuck with lire
coins that I don't want," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too busy to convert from marks to euros for every sale," said a
harried clerk at the Markt im Bahnhof convenience store in Frankfurt as
she shelled out change for travelers' fruit, sandwich and soft drink
purchases from two registers.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers can pay with their national currency or the euro through
Feb. 28, the end of a two-month transition period. But Goralczyk of the
German bank association has predicted that more than 90% of transactions
will be in euros by next week. Once banks open today, consumers are
likely to turn in their marks, francs, guilders, pesetas and other
outgoing currencies in exchange for euros to ease the scene at checkout
stands. Commission-free exchanges will be available for at least six
months; banks will be allowed to charge a modest fee for the swap after
that.</TE>
<TE>   The euro launch went so smoothly that even some officials in holdout
Britain were observing, for the benefit of the deeply skeptical citizens,
that the country stands to lose influence if it stays outside the euro
zone.</TE>
<TE>   "If we want to be the decisive leading power, it's difficult to see
how we could be that if we ruled ourselves out of joining the single
currency forever," Peter Hain, the minister of state for European
affairs, said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.</TE>
<TE>   British Prime Minister Tony Blair also has signaled his support for
joining the euro and has promised to decide within the next 18 months
whether--or more likely, when--to call a referendum. About two-thirds of
Britons continue to oppose surrendering sterling for the euro, according
to polls.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden and Denmark also have opted out of the common currency, the
largest monetary changeover in history, with 14 billion bank notes and 52
billion coins providing the most voluminous legal tender after the U.S.
dollar. But officials in both Scandinavian nations have pegged their
currencies to the euro, and many shops and services post prices in euros
as well.</TE>

<HD>Study Ties Vitamin A, Hip Injuries</HD>
<DH>Health: Women with high intakes showed double the risk of fractures
against those with low intakes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Too much vitamin A may increase the risk of hip fractures in older
women, according to a study researchers say suggests the need to
reevaluate the levels in supplements and fortified food.</LD>
<LD>   Vitamin A is important for such things as healthy skin and hair and
bone growth. But in the study published in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Assn., researchers found that women with the highest
total intake--from food and vitamin supplements--had double the risk of
hip fractures compared with women with the lowest intakes.</LD>
<LD>   One theory is that too much vitamin A inhibits the ability of vitamin
D to help the body absorb calcium, said lead author Diane Feskanich, an
epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She said
previous studies also suggest vitamin A affects cells that work in the
breakdown and rebuilding of bone.</LD>
<TE>   The adverse effects appear to be caused only by too much retinol--the
true form of vitamin A, found in such things as liver, fish oils and
supplements--and not by foods rich in beta carotene, such as dark, leafy
vegetables. Beta carotene is converted by the body to vitamin A as
needed.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers analyzed dietary questionnaires from more than 70,000
post-menopausal women--all nurses from 34 to 77 years old. From 1980 to
1998, there were 603 hip fractures from such things as falling from the
height of a chair or tripping.</TE>
<TE>   The risk was almost twice as high among women with retinol intake of
2,000 micrograms or more per day, compared with those with intakes of
less than 500 micrograms daily. And women taking a vitamin A supplement
had a 40% greater risk of hip fracture than women not taking the
supplement, Feskanich said.</TE>
<TE>   The Institute of Medicine, a private organization that sets the
nation's recommended daily allowances for nutrients, recommends that
women get 700 micrograms a day of the vitamin. But multivitamins
typically contain about 1,500 micrograms because the Food and Drug
Administration has not updated vitamin supplement labels, Feskanich said.</TE>
<TE>   She said that, between multivitamin supplements and fortified food, it
is not difficult for women to attain vitamin A levels high enough to
cause problems. Some increased risk was even seen at the recommended
levels.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're taking a multivitamin and consuming fortified milk and
cereal . . . after a while, there are just too many sources," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said the FDA should consider lowering labeling standards for
vitamin A. Also, some foods fortified with the vitamin might not need to
be or could be fortified with beta carotene instead of retinol, she said.</TE>

disputed Kashmir region and deadly attacks by suspected Islamic
militants, India and Pakistan upheld their New Year's tradition of
exchanging lists of their civilian nuclear facilities, traded every year
to prevent attack on the installations. And India eased a new ban on
overflights to allow two Pakistani planes to enter its airspace.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Pakistan said a gathering of South Asian leaders this week
in Nepal could bring some easing of tensions, even though India has said
it will not hold any direct talks on the crisis at the summit.</LD>
<TE>   Vajpayee and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf will attend the
Friday-Sunday meeting of seven regional leaders, and the two countries'
foreign ministers will be at a preliminary gathering today and Thursday.
A Vajpayee spokesman, Ashok Tandon, said that "no meeting is planned with
Pakistan at any level."</TE>
<TE>   But a Pakistani government spokesman, Ashfaq Ahmad Gondal, said a
meeting of foreign ministers "cannot be ruled out."</TE>
<TE>   The crisis was sparked by a Dec. 13 attack on India's Parliament.
India blames Pakistan for the attack and has said no dialogue is possible
until the nation stops supporting terrorists in Kashmir.</TE>

<HD>Israel's Katsav Blocked in Effort to Give Talk</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Sharon bars president's move to propose truce to
Palestinians. U.S. envoy Zinni is due back in region Thursday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>In an unusual public disagreement over what gestures Israel should
make as Mideast violence declines, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on Tuesday
blocked Israel's president from proposing a yearlong cease-fire to the
Palestinian parliament.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon rejected the proposal for President Moshe Katsav to address
Palestinian legislators in the West Bank city of Ramallah, calling it a
public relations ploy by Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat,
said a Sharon aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. That brought a
rare rebuke by Katsav, whose post is largely ceremonial.</LD>
<LD>   Katsav, a member of Sharon's Likud Party, almost never gets involved
in the nitty-gritty of policymaking. The proposed address would have put
him in the political spotlight and would have come at a time when
Israelis and Palestinians are holding internal debates about what sort of
moves to make to end 15 months of confrontation.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. special Mideast envoy Anthony C. Zinni, a retired Marine Corps
general, will return Thursday to push for steps toward renewing peace
talks, said Paul Patin, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   During a four-day visit, Zinni will ask Arafat to dismantle militant
groups and will urge Sharon to ease restrictions on the Palestinians,
Patin said. Zinni broke off his first Mideast mission in mid-December
amid a sharp escalation of violence, including a series of attacks on
Israeli civilians by Palestinian militants. At the time, U.S. officials
criticized Arafat for not doing enough to prevent such attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Violence has declined considerably since Arafat delivered a Dec. 16
speech calling for an end to attacks against Israel, and some in the
Israeli government have called for an easing of the restrictions placed
on the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, however, has been reluctant to make conciliatory gestures,
arguing that Arafat must do more to end attacks on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Katsav was "disappointed" by Sharon's veto, Israeli radio reported,
and the president's office issued a rare statement challenging Sharon.
"The presidency regrets the tone of the reaction from the prime
minister's office, a tone which is both unseemly and inappropriate," it
said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli media cited unidentified officials in Sharon's office as
calling Katsav's proposal "stupid" and a "fool's trap."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of the Katsav speech was first raised by a former Israeli
Arab legislator, Abdul Wahab Darawshe, who referred to the truce as a
hudna, a term from Arab tribal law describing a specific period of
nonbelligerence.</TE>

<LD>Rebels attacked the headquarters of the Russian Federal Security
Service in Grozny, the Chechen capital, firing grenades and automatic
weapons, the agency said. No one was injured.</LD>
<LD>   The agency, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, last year took
charge of directing the war in the separatist region of the republic of
Chechnya, which Russia terms an anti-terrorist operation.</LD>
<LD>   Russian officials contend that the rebels are on the verge of defeat,
but the insurgents torment Russian forces with near-daily small attacks.</LD>

<LD>Chinese factory workers are preventing a New Jersey man from
leaving their town until he pays for toys they say they made for him.</LD>
<LD>   The State Department said it has contacted Chinese authorities about
the situation of Henry Zhu, a permanent U.S. resident. But the U.S. is
not guaranteed access to Zhu because he is a Chinese citizen.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington Post last week identified Zhu as a resident of Edison,
N.J., and said he had been held for three weeks in a hotel in Sheyang,
200 miles northwest of Shanghai. Workers told the Post they want $55,000
for stuffed animals they made for Zhu's import firm.</LD>

<HD>Possible Arson Blaze Guts Old Hollywood Building</HD>
<DH>Landmark: Vacant Hillview apartments had been home to many aspiring
stars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A piece of Hollywood history went up in smoke Tuesday as a possible
arson blaze gutted a turn-of-the-century apartment building once called
home by an assortment of stars and celebrity hopefuls.</LD>
<LD>   One hundred firefighters battled for more than two hours to douse the
flames that began to roar through the vacant 64-unit Hillview apartments
at about 9:15 a.m., causing an estimated $500,000 in damage.</LD>
<LD>   A supervisor at the scene said gasoline was found on the first floor
of the four-story Mediterranean structure. But he referred official
comment to Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells, who would say only that
an arson investigation is underway.</LD>
<TE>   The pink stucco structure was built in 1917, in the era of silent
movies, by film tycoon Jesse L. Lasky as a place for aspiring stars.
Residents included silent screen actress Mae Busch, who appeared in the
films of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, during the industry's infancy, many landlords considered
actors unreliable tenants. Some Hollywood boarding houses posted signs
reading: "No actors, no dogs." Lasky, who produced Hollywood's first
feature film, "The Squaw Man," in 1913, saw the need--and the market--for
specialized housing.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, you couldn't name an actor that didn't live here,"
Douglas Carlton of the preservation group Keep Old Los Angeles said of
the apartments at 6533 Hollywood Blvd.</TE>
<TE>   But the luster of the Hillview's heyday dulled long ago.</TE>
<TE>   Although it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, no
one has lived there since 1994, when the Northridge earthquake damaged
many units. Around the same time, the building took another jolt when
subway construction along Hollywood Boulevard caused more damage. The
owners at the time said they wanted to level the building.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Hillview has switched hands several times. On Tuesday,
a for-sale sign stood in front of the charred apartments. No one at
Millennium Holdings, a Santa Monica-based real estate company that posted
the sign, could be reached for comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Hillview is sandwiched between a tattoo parlor and narrow Hudson
Street.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors, meanwhile, mourned the loss of a building that symbolized
the old Hollywood at a time when the area is undergoing a major overhaul,
marked by the opening in November of the $615-million Hollywood &amp;
Highland retail entertainment center.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a beautiful building. What a shame," said Rochelle Lesinsky,
59, who has lived in the neighborhood for nearly two years. "They're only
saving a few [old buildings], you know, and this one was salvageable."</TE>

<HD>3 Slain, 1 Hurt by Gunfire at Eastside Party</HD>
<DH>Crime: 'Whoever shot these guys really wanted them dead,' an
officer says. Neighbors have protested rising violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three men were killed and a woman was wounded in Lincoln Heights
when a gunman opened fire Tuesday outside a New Year's party, heightening
fears in a neighborhood that has been hit by increasing gang violence.</LD>
<LD>   "Whoever shot these guys really wanted them dead, judging by the way
it happened," Los Angeles Police Det. Rodrigo Amador said of the
slayings. All of the men were shot in the upper body, possibly several
times, with a large-caliber weapon.</LD>
<LD>   Killed in the 5:30 a.m. shootings were suspected gang members Juan
Manuel Torres, Felipe Meza and Lionel Mendivel, all in their late 20s.
Veronica Cortez, 28, was hospitalized in stable condition, police said.</LD>
<TE>   The gunfire aimed at party-goers outside a house on West Avenue 28
near Workman Avenue triggered panic.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard shots, real loud--they sounded like they came from something
big," said Alfredo Polanco, 35, who lives several houses away. "There was
screaming and people running."</TE>
<TE>   One of Mendivel's aunts said he was the father an 8-month-old girl and
a 3-year-old girl. Information on the others victims could not be
obtained late Tuesday. A friend of the wounded woman said she was shot in
the arm.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting took place in front of a home frequented by gang members,
police and neighbors said. Members of two local gangs appear to have been
at the party, said Amador, of the Hollenbeck station. Police have served
at least one arrest warrant at the house in connection with a shooting,
Amador said.</TE>
<TE>   Amador and other detectives said there were probably plenty of
witnesses, but they were typically reluctant to talk.</TE>
<TE>   "You know you have lots of witnesses, but you also know why people
don't want to talk. It's frustrating," said Det. Cindy Juarez. "The whole
area is bordered by gangs and these people live here."</TE>
<TE>   There were 38 homicides in 2001 in Hollenbeck--an area that
encompasses most of Los Angeles' Eastside. That's six more than the year
before. Overall gang activity seems to be up, Amador said.</TE>
<TE>   "The first day of the year and we already have three," Amador said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said they were afraid that gunfire could hit unintended
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got kids here. We don't want them hurt or killed because of
someone else's stupidity," said one neighbor, who requested anonymity
because of fear of gang retaliation. "It gets old to live like a hermit."</TE>
<TE>   In late November, a 76-year-old woman and a 16-year-old girl were
wounded in Lincoln Heights by suspected gang gunfire. Both survived.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-December, about 100 residents gathered to protest the
neighborhood's escalating number of gang-related shootings. According to
LAPD statistics, the area around one school not far from Tuesday's fatal
shooting had more than 70 shootings last year, compared with 50 for 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Seven hours after the shooting, neighbors on West Avenue 28 swept
garbage from the bloodstained sidewalk before firefighters used hoses to
wash off the blood. A car parked near where the victims collapsed bore
two bloody handprints. Neighbors pointed to a nearby chink on a concrete
light pole caused during a drive-by shooting about a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information on the shootings is asked to call Hollenbeck
homicide detectives at (323) 526-3000.</TE>
<TE>   Countywide, there were several shootings on New Year's Eve and early
New Year's Day. In Watts, a woman who was setting up a sprinkler in her
frontyard was struck in the back by a bullet fired in the air shortly
after midnight. Patricia Bucio, 24, had just put her children to sleep
and stepped outside her home on Anzac Avenue near 97th Street, said Sgt.
Samuel Mark of the LAPD's Southeast station. She was hospitalized in
stable condition, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also in Watts, a woman stabbed her boyfriend to death after an
argument in a home in the 100 block of East 107th Street, police said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Westlake area, suspected gang members in a sport utility
vehicle shot three people in different, nearby locations just before 2
a.m. The first person was shot in the neck at West 11th and Alvarado
streets, and hospitalized in stable condition, said LAPD Sgt. Paul
Torrance of the Rampart station. Another man was shot near Alvarado
Street and Olympic, and another man was shot at a nearby location after
that. Both men were in stable condition, Torrance said.</TE>

<HD>Hear Ye! A Colorful Tradition Lives On</HD>
<DH>Civics: Complete with costume and clarion voice, a British emigre
livens county doings as official crier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MARTINEZ, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>In his purple velvet coat, stockings and frilly white lace, Redmond
O'Connell stood on the steps of City Hall in this Bay Area bedroom
community and did what he does best: attract attention.</LD>
<LD>   He clanged a large bell and read from a script he prepared himself,
singing the praises of the town where he has lived for a decade.</LD>
<LD>   "Oyez. Oyez. Oyez. A warm welcome awaits visitors to Martinez,
California," he cried. "We are home to the largest bocce ball federation
in the world, the mischievous martini, the model of modesty Mr. Joe
DiMaggio and the magnificent marching master, Mr. John Muir. Blessings on
the United States of America, God save the queen."</LD>
<TE>   As usual when O'Connell performs, people gawked. They stopped to
listen. These reactions always make O'Connell smile.</TE>
<TE>   The full-time actor, former cabby and bartender--who has impersonated
everyone from Santa Claus and a Thanksgiving turkey to a 6-foot-tall
Easter Bunny--is the official Martinez town crier.</TE>
<TE>   Going by the name Redmond O'Colonies, the 51-year-old British-born
performer is one of only a handful of town criers west of the Mississippi
River. And his oratory has won him awards: O'Connell earned the American
Guild of Town Criers championship in September and finished fifth in the
world championships in August.</TE>
<TE>   "I make this town look good," he said. "Most people think I'm a
pacifist pirate. I dress kind of funny, and I have no weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Working for free for the city, he dons his Revolutionary War-era
costume--complete with buckled shoes, three-cornered hat and scroll--an
average of twice a month to "cry" at civic ceremonies, spread goodwill
and dedicate new buildings, such as the town's Amtrak station. When not
crying, he makes a living doing commercials and other acting projects.</TE>
<TE>   His crier style is a cross between Benny Hill and Monte Python, his
lilting accent shaped by an upbringing in Lancashire.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell has been the Martinez crier since 1991, when he approached
the City Council about creating the position for the rural community.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me this was a town of critters, not criers," he recalled.
"But they agreed, as long as I didn't bring any disgrace to the city and
it didn't cost anything."</TE>
<TE>   In more than a decade his speechmaking and public rhetoric have
brought statewide publicity.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got such a big heart," said Martinez Vice Mayor Linda Lewis.
"And as funny as he is, he takes this seriously. He commands attention
when he speaks. You could hear a pin drop when he dedicated our new
Amtrak station."</TE>
<TE>   On a stormy day in this town 25 miles northeast of San Francisco,
O'Connell demonstrated a tenet of his trade: Rain or shine, a crier
cries.</TE>
<TE>   Passersby tipped their umbrellas to see him. "Hey, what are you
supposed to be?" asked James McCoy.</TE>
<TE>   Trotting up the steps to pay his taxes, local resident Stan Stanley
was impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of charming," he said. "It makes you think back to the way
we used to do things in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Since arriving in the United States from England in 1977, O'Connell
has played the role of a storytelling roustabout.</TE>
<TE>   He briefly drove a cab in Los Angeles before moving to San Francisco,
where he worked as a carpenter, kitchen designer, bartender and musician.
He also began doing comedy, perfecting the art of "bending reality,"
working parties and dinners as a smiling merry prankster.</TE>
<TE>   He was once hired by a group of 18 office workers to play a trick on
three managers--showing up at work one day as the nightmare temp worker.</TE>
<TE>   "I did everything wrong," O'Connell recalled.</TE>
<TE>   At a company party he and another actor played two inept waiters
having a very public argument before a stunned audience.</TE>
<TE>   "My passion is walking the fine line between reality and
surrealism--under the guise of street theater," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He became a town crier almost by accident.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell was a member of an environmental activist group protesting a
chemical company's application for a permit to burn toxic waste. As part
of the "good neighbor" campaign to picket the company, O'Connell rented a
town crier's costume to spread the word.</TE>
<TE>   Later, a friend in Britain told him that her hometown had its own
full-time crier. That inspired O'Connell to approach the Martinez City
Council. He later assumed the role for the entire county.</TE>
<TE>   "Crying," he says, "is a great way to give back to one's community."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he's twice won the American Guild of Town Criers
championship, and he serves as the group's president. In the
competitions, he has bested other criers with his sustained volume,
diction, clarity and elegance.</TE>
<TE>   He's cried everywhere from Sydney, Australia, to San Luis Obispo and
performed at Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates' engagement party in San

<TE>   "The mayor from one of our neighboring cities is quite a seamstress,

looking a bit shabby. And we want to take care of our crier the way he
takes care of us."</TE>

<HD>Resolved: S.Lo to Dress the Role to Attain Favored Seating Status</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE LOPEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yes, as a matter of fact. I have made a resolution.</LD>
<LD>   I plan to go out to eat every night in 2002, because there's no better
way to study L.A. society than by making the restaurant scene.</LD>
<LD>   Recently my wife and I had a special occasion to celebrate. It called
for something other than the No. 2 combination at Los Tacos on Santa
Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood. So we got into the station wagon and
went to a very nice eatery on the Westside, named for an olive. We were
seated so close to the bathroom they could have hung the towel dispenser
from our table.</LD>
<TE>   It might have been the Subaru. If you pull up to a Westside restaurant
in a Subaru station wagon, there's just no way to look like you've got
anything in syndication or post-production. The valets radio in to the
host that a couple of rubes are headed for the door, and the fix is in.</TE>
<TE>   So there we were at our sad little table on our very special night and
now the waiters were flipping coins to see who got stuck with us. Who
would want these stiffs who were such nobodies they got parked next to
the commode?</TE>
<TE>   After the appetizers, roughly six months went by before there was
another sighting of our waiter. I thought maybe he went home sick or had
changed into all black and disappeared into the crowd. But suddenly he
appeared out of nowhere, fussing like a hen over a young couple who were
being seated next to us.</TE>
<TE>   They might have been somebody, the way their glasses were refilled
every time they took a sip of wine, but I don't think so. The thing was,
the woman was dressed like Britney Spears and the guy had a skull cap
pulled down over his ears and to a point just above his eyes, like either
he had just come in off a ski slope or had just knocked over a
convenience store.</TE>
<TE>   This is the look, I gather. I'm sure we'll see it in one of the next
televised car chases. And I happen to think it's the look for me in 2002,
as I complete my image make-over and become S.Lo, man about town.</TE>
<TE>   My question to you is this:</TE>
<TE>   If I had made a reservation at that same restaurant under the name
S.Lo, then showed up wearing a cap pulled down to my sinuses, would they
have stuck me next to the john?</TE>
<TE>   Of course not. I don't think you have to actually be somebody. You
simply have to look like you might be somebody.</TE>
<TE>   The worst that can happen is that the guy in the skull cap sees me
wearing one, and asks himself if he looks like as big a dope as I do.
This used to work with my sons when they started wearing their pants
around their knees. When we went out in public, I threatened that if they
didn't hitch up their trousers, I'd hang mine even lower than theirs, a
visual that I believe haunts them to this day.</TE>
<TE>   As the new year dawns, I just have to embrace the S.Lo persona, and
L.A. will be mine. That's the plan, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Kelsey Grammer, who recently bought a $6.9-million beach house in
Malibu because the $4.5-million spread in the nearby hills was too far
from the water, once walked into a Venice restaurant with a young blonde
and an older woman I took to be either his mother or mother-in-law. With
God and Allah as my witnesses, the older woman was wearing a "Frasier"
jacket. I don't recall, but it's entirely possible the younger woman, who
might have been his wife, was wearing a "Cheers" jacket.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the Grammer party sauntered in after us and got seated
before us, which would have happened even if I'd won a Nobel Prize for
curing cancer. But would it have happened if my wife was wearing an S.Lo
jacket?</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of sitcom royalty, once, on another very special and elegant
occasion with a former boss, I dined at the Hotel Bel-Air. For all I
know, this might be the only jacket-required restaurant in a 600-mile
radius, but on the one and only night I was there, a true rebel decided
to challenge the house rules.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Seinfeld.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the tragic moral dilemma for the Bel-Air.</TE>
<TE>   Should they honor their own standard, or keep a big sitcom star happy?</TE>
<TE>   They seated Jerry at a very lovely booth. I think if he had been
wearing a skull cap, they would have comped the meal.</TE>

<HD>Sewage Cleanup Is Focus of Talks</HD>
<DH>Border: Officials of both countries hope a novel idea will end
decades of dumping untreated Mexican waste into the ocean off the U.S.
coast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO
</DL>
<LD>For decades, untreated waste has poured from a sieve-like system in
Tijuana and flowed downhill through the Tijuana River into the United
States, where it eventually dumps into the Pacific Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   Officials from the U.S. and Mexico are preparing for talks this month
that many hope will solve the problem, which has beset generations of
residents along the border. The negotiations center on a novel proposal
for piping millions of gallons of sewage back to Mexico for treatment at
a privately run plant.</LD>
<LD>   The runaway sewage symbolizes the difficulties of curing cross-border
ills, even those that everyone acknowledges. Experts and officials point
to many factors, including spotty attention to border problems by both
governments and rocketing population growth along the frontier that
constantly strains thin resources.</LD>
<TE>   What are mundane local problems elsewhere become complicated at the
border by international diplomacy and an alphabet soup of government
agencies in two nations. In the case of Tijuana's sewage, no fewer than a
dozen municipal, state and federal agencies have been involved at one
time or another.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you need all the stakeholders involved in a decision,
everyone recognizes how hard that is. Any time you stick a border between
them, it doubles the number of people who need to be involved," said Rick
Van Schoik, managing director of the Southwest Center for Environmental
Research and Policy, which monitors border issues. "It boils down to: You
just need that many more voices at the table."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, cross-border sewage has been the focus of binational
agreements, public hearings, angry rhetoric and lawsuits, one of which
was settled in December. There have been signs of progress, including
construction on U.S. soil of a joint treatment plant that captures and
partly cleans up to 25 million gallons of the overflow waste each day.</TE>
<TE>   But there also has been a lot of public tussling over treatment
methods. Often, it has seemed only the sewage was moving in a unified
direction.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that raw and under-treated waste continues to empty into
the ocean off Imperial Beach, creating a hazard for surfers and a
persistent bother for leaders of the beach city and residents of the
Tijuana River Valley nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Some border analysts say policy makers erred in spending $400 million
to build the plant and its massive ocean pipe on the U.S. side rather
than to repair leaks and constructing smaller facilities in Tijuana. "You
end up trying to build infrastructure in the U.S. to solve a problem in
Mexico that frankly just doesn't work," said Mark J. Spalding, who
teaches international environmental law at UC San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Steps are newly underway to cure the problem at its source in Mexico,
where work has begun on more than $140 million in projects to expand
Tijuana's sewer system and plug leaks that send a torrent of waste onto
U.S. soil during heavy winter rains. Fast population growth means Tijuana
will need all the treatment capacity it can get.</TE>
<TE>Sending It Back to Mexico</TE>
<TE>   The upcoming negotiations between U.S. officials of the International
Boundary and Water Commission and their Mexican counterparts focus on a
proposal to send the waste water partly treated at the U.S. plant back to
Mexico for final cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   U.S.-based entrepreneurs propose building a plant in Tijuana and
charging the American government to run the facility under terms of a
20-year contract, still to be negotiated. The treated effluent could be
sold to Tijuana factories for industrial use or piped back to the United
States for discharge into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Effluent from the existing border plant, which travels to sea through
a giant pipe, violates federal clean-water standards for ocean dumping.
The proposed Tijuana plant, known as Bajagua, with a capacity of at least
50 million gallons, would further treat that waste water.</TE>
<TE>   The novelty of hiring a private company for the job has made some U.S.
officials uneasy--one reason it has taken more than a year to begin
binational talks that Congress called for last year. Mexican officials
have expressed concerns, but foreign ministry officials say they are
eager to begin the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The upcoming talks are but the latest turn in a long-running saga. It
comes more than a decade after the two countries agreed on a plan that
called for the United States to build and run the main plant north of the
border, with help from Mexico, and to assume responsibility for treating
the waste further so it can be piped into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Amid ceremony and optimism, that plant began operating fully in 1998
when the huge pipe, known as an outfall, that ferries waste to the ocean
was completed.</TE>
<TE>   But a method for the second level of treatment has remained the topic
of ferocious debate. U.S. officials withdrew a proposal for an adjacent
plant in the face of a lawsuit by the Sierra Club and Surfrider
Foundation, then suggested a series of open-air treatment ponds. That
idea stalled in the face of protests by residents who feared foul odors
and a proliferation of mosquitoes.</TE>
<TE>Some Complain of Unknowns</TE>
<TE>   Amid the debate came the Bajagua proposal, offered by a U.S.-based
investment partnership called AguaClara. The approach pleased many
partisans, including some environmentalists. Congressional
representatives and San Diego politicians became big backers, but leaders
in Imperial Beach feared more delays by starting from scratch. Some
environmentalists say the project includes too many unknowns, including
final costs. Congress authorized $156 million over five years.</TE>
<TE>   The upcoming talks could end the squabbling--or add a fresh chapter to
the sewage epic.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what Mexico is going to bring to the table. We have a
framework in the negotiations, but I can't tell you what Mexico is going
to propose," said Carlos M. Ramirez, commissioner of the U.S. section of
the border commission.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very unique situation. I don't think anything like this has
ever been done," Ramirez said. "[The talks] could go quickly if Mexico
doesn't have great concerns. Or if there are concerns, that could slow
things down."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Rep. Bob Filner (D-San Diego), whose border district includes a
swath of the affected area, charged that the border commission and U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency have delayed the negotiations. At a
congressional hearing on the matter in December, the State Department
announced that it was ready to begin the talks.</TE>
<TE>   Filner said the Bajagua idea is good for residents in both countries.
But he conceded that details remain to be ironed out before the border's
sewer problems are resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we were out of it when we got the plant built," Filner
said. "I thought I was out of sewage. But I'm back into it."</TE>

<HD>Crowded O.C. Schools Seek Bond Relief</HD>
<DH>Education: Seven districts seek voters' OK for $731.6 million to
build and repair learning sites. Proposition 39's smaller-majority
election rule bolsters hopes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teachers and parents in the Anaheim City School District would love
to end the staggered scheduling that has many students arriving in shifts
and shuffling between classes to make limited seating work for everyone.</LD>
<LD>   That's one reason the district is seeking a $111-million bond measure,
despite the fact a similar effort failed a few years ago with a 55% yes
vote. Another reason: A change in election rules means that same
percentage now would be a winning majority.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, school bonds required a two-thirds majority from the
voters. But Proposition 39, passed by voters in 2000, reduced that to
55%.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the new rule has prompted seven Orange County districts to
place bond measures, totaling $731.6 million, on the March 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds will be sought by three elementary school districts, two high
school districts, a unified school district and the North Orange
Community College District, which includes Fullerton and Cypress
colleges.</TE>
<TE>   If all the bond measures pass, that would mean more than $1 billion
new dollars for school construction and repair work, since all the
districts would qualify for some matching state money.</TE>
<TE>   "We're confident the public wants good schools, and our kids deserve
it," said Gary Rutherford, superintendent of the Huntington Beach City
School District.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, a $30-million bond for Rutherford's schools failed with
just 62% approval. Now the district is retooling its proposal and will
try again in March.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the seven districts' bond money would go for new facilities to
house growing enrollment. But for many older schools, long delayed
repairs are in order.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got classrooms with just one electrical outlet," Rutherford
said. "That won't accommodate today's teaching methods, where you need
plenty of places to plug in computers."</TE>
<TE>   In some parts of the county, though, the number of school bond
measures could make voters balk. Some voters in Fullerton and Anaheim
will face several different bond issues on the same ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The bond in Huntington Beach would cost voters $16 annually for each
$100,000 assessed property valuation. But in Anaheim, voters are being
asked to support three bonds for a total of $85.70 above their current
tax for every $100,000 assessed valuation--for the city schools, the high
school district and the North Orange County Community College District.
Fullerton residents, also in the North Orange County Community College
District, must also vote on three bonds, for a $68.25 total per $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   School officials are aware that some voters might bristle at the
lineup of bond measures.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't have a choice; we need the money," said Cameron McCune,
superintendent of the Fullerton School District, which has nearly 20
elementary schools.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton educators note the city's nickname is "The Education City."
That gives them confidence that voters will be willing to pay for the
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The Anaheim Union High School District isn't taking chances.
Volunteers there have already conducted telephone campaigns to lobby
voters and make them aware the issue is on the March ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition groups in Fullerton and Anaheim have filed campaign
statements against the bonds, which will go out with the sample ballots.
In Huntington Beach, five individuals signed a statement opposing the
bond measure.</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim, Homeowners Maintaining Their Environment wrote in its
campaign statement that taxpayers should not have to pay for
mismanagement by school leaders. "Giving these wasteful school
administrators more of our money is not the answer. . . . For years,
funds that could have been spent on building maintenance were used
instead to hire more administrative personnel and give fat pay increases
to nonteaching staff members," the statement reads.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the bond measures could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>Prop. 13 Put School Bonds in Voters' Hands</TE>
<TE>   Until Proposition 13 in 1978, school districts did not need voter
approval for bonds. Their boards had the power to impose tax hikes. But
Proposition 13 changed that and led to the two-thirds majority
requirement for any tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a look at the seven districts and how they want to spend
construction bond money.</TE>
<TE>   * Anaheim City School District seeks $111 million for an ambitious
10-year plan that includes four new schools--two in the northern part of
the city, one near Ponderosa Park, and a fourth at Harbor Boulevard and
Ball Road--to alleviate crowding and eliminate staggered schedules. It
also would construct two-story classroom buildings at Horace Mann and
Abraham Lincoln elementary schools, two of its older campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the district has more than 22,000 students in schools designed to
hold 11,000. It gets by with portable classroom units and staggered
classes.</TE>
<TE>   The district's Sunkist Elementary, built for 500 students, now has an
enrollment of 1,200. The campus's 57 full-time teachers share 33
classrooms, including eight portables. The school operates year-round on
a staggered daily schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Because there is no cafeteria, students pick up their lunches from a
serving table outside, rain or shine, and carry the food to whichever
classroom is empty at the time. For assemblies, the children carry their
classroom seats to an asphalt area outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   The new bond, even with matching money from the state, wouldn't end
year-round schools. But spokeswoman Suzanne Brown said ending staggered
classes is a major priority in surveys of parents.</TE>
<TE>   "If their children are in the later classes, it's often difficult to
fit in with their work schedules," she said.</TE>
<TE>   * Anaheim Union High School District seeks $132 million for
renovations at all of its schools and would add a junior high school. If
the bond measure passes, it may receive $125 million in state money.</TE>
<TE>   "Our students are trying to compete with school systems which already
have advanced technology," Supt. Jan Billings said. "We must make major
changes in our classrooms--get our students out of those portables--if
we're going to keep up."</TE>
<TE>   The district has 33,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   * Fullerton Joint Union High School District, with 15,000 students,
seeks $67.9 million to add 18,000-square-foot classroom buildings at each
of its six comprehensive high schools. Each would include a new library.</TE>
<TE>   * Fullerton School District, with 13,400 students, seeks $49.7 million
to build an elementary school for the new Amerige Heights residential
development at the old Hughes Aircraft property near Malvern Avenue and
Gilbert Street.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the rest of the money would be used to upgrade the other
schools. "We've got sewer lines so old they've got roots growing in
them," Supt. McCune said.</TE>
<TE>   * Huntington Beach City School District, with 13,500 students, seeks
$30 million for refurbishment and repair--including some new roofs--at
nine of its 10 schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We simply need to modernize," Rutherford said.</TE>
<TE>   * North Orange Community College District seeks $239 million for
additional classroom space at Cypress and Fullerton colleges, plus
renovation of the old Martin Luther Hospital in Anaheim that it now owns.
It will convert that space into administrative offices and adult
education classrooms. The district has 36,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   * Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District seeks $102 million to
build the first high school in Yorba Linda, primarily to alleviate
overcrowding at Esperanza High School in Anaheim, which has 3,000
students at facilities built for 2,000. Plans also call for two new
elementary schools and a middle school. The district student population
has grown from 17,000 to about 27,000 over the last 10 years.</TE>

<HD>Principal Plays to Student Potential, Not Failure</HD>
<DH>While pupils love Dhyan Lal, Jordan High consistently scores poorly
on standardized tests, and some complain that there's not enough
attention to classwork.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting on a school bench recently, Dhyan Lal recounted with pride
a speech he gave nearly two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   He had been principal of Jordan High School in Watts for just two
months when he called an assembly for each grade--no parents, teachers or
other administrators allowed--to introduce himself to the 2,200 students.</LD>
<LD>   He tried to warn the students about perceptions, about how some people
considered them "project kids" who would only commit crimes and end up on
welfare.</LD>
<TE>   "They say kids [here] don't care, it's gang-ridden, kids can't read or
write," he recalled saying. "I don't see that. I see potential, but
you've got to meet me halfway."'</TE>
<TE>   It was an unusual start to a stewardship that has been called
unconventional and, at times, imperfect.</TE>
<TE>   Lal, 53, a native of Fiji who has been known to wear lava-lava skirts,
Polynesian shirts and sandals on the job, took on the task of reforming
Jordan High in February 2000. So far, under his leadership, there have
been uplifting changes: The campus is cleaner, suspensions have dropped,
and more students have graduated than before he took over. The academic
decathlon team has been reinvigorated, and many students say their
classmates are more unified.</TE>
<TE>   "He loves these kids, and they love him," said James Tomlinson, who
has been dean for 17 years. "Dr. Lal has lifted the spirits of this
place."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some staff members complain that he is too focused on
superficial improvements and not enough on academic achievement.</TE>
<TE>   The school has consistently scored at the bottom of the state academic
performance index, which is based on Stanford 9 tests. And in October,
the school's performance slipped further, dropping 19 points, or 4.4%,
from the previous year. Jordan tied with Manual Arts Senior High as the
second-lowest-scoring high school in the Los Angeles Unified School
District.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Hernandez, a former Jordan High teacher, said she left in part
because the curriculum was ineffective. Hernandez, who now teaches at the
Los Angeles Academy, described the Jordan staff as "a dysfunctional
family."</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone can smile and say it's just great," Hernandez said. But
"those students are not getting prepared. The focus on academics is not
there."</TE>
<TE>   She and others also complained that Lal makes belittling jokes about
women and ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   Lal responds that he does not intend to upset people. "I don't see
ethnic groups. I see people. I see kids and human beings," Lal said. "I
use humor as a way of easing tension."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, he joked to a group of teachers: "You know all
Asians look alike." On another occasion, he asked a Latino staff member:
"Did you eat your burritos today?"</TE>
<TE>   Lal has come to Jordan at a crucial time for California high schools,
which are feeling pressure to boost academic performance. Jordan, like
many schools in poor urban areas, faces considerable obstacles. It is
overcrowded, has many inexperienced teachers and serves many students who
are still learning English.</TE>
<TE>   If the school does not improve in coming years, it could face
consequences as serious as a takeover by the state.</TE>
<TE>   But rather than focusing on test scores right away, Lal said he first
wants to boost students' confidence by improving their self-esteem and
their physical surroundings.</TE>
<TE>Upgrading Campus Was First Priority</TE>
<TE>   Jordan High is located between two of the most crime-ridden housing
projects in Los Angeles--Jordan Downs and Imperial Courts. It is in a
neighborhood of abandoned stores with broken windows and graffiti-covered
walls.</TE>
<TE>   Lal's priority when he arrived was to upgrade the dilapidated campus.
Rian Turner, 16, described it like this: "We had benches with holes in
them, dirt, no grass, gum all over the walls, graffiti all over the
walls, holes in the sidewalks. You could step in them and break your
ankle."</TE>
<TE>   Lal refurbished the courtyard, putting in new blue benches and lunch
tables. He disciplined students for fighting or skipping class by making
them spend their weekends painting campus walls. He turned an abandoned
storage room into a computer lab, and created a center where students are
taught how to repair used computers. The computers are then donated to
local families.</TE>
<TE>   Lal also instituted two-hour class periods four days a week, instead
of the usual 54-minute periods. He believes that will prepare students
better for college classes.</TE>
<TE>   Many students and staff members applaud him.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Spires, 26, a teacher at Jordan, said Lal was her principal
when she was a student at Carson High School, where he worked for three
years. She took the job at Jordan because she remembered the compassion
he had for students at Carson.</TE>
<TE>   "He's exactly the same today as he was then," Spires said. Despite his
joking, he is sensitive to racial issues, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of what ethnicity he is, he is a minority," she said. "He
has had to face some of the same issues and overcome some of the same
obstacles as all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Principal Janet Salem, who has been at Jordan for nine
years, said she is excited to be part of a positive change--something the
school has needed for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't demean students," she said. "He accepts [that] students
make mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   One 16-year-old met Lal last year after he came upon her slashing her
wrist with a box cutter in the gym. On a recent afternoon, she recounted
how Lal visited her at the police station after the incident. He told her
that he expected more out of her and that he believed in her.</TE>
<TE>   Now, she confides in him all the time.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to let him down, because he didn't let me down that
day," she said, tears welling up in her eyes. "I never thought that
someone I didn't know could care so much for me and trust me the way he
did."</TE>
<TE>   Lal consoled Turner, a junior, last year after one of his basketball
teammates was killed in a car accident. He also arranged for three school
buses to take students to the funeral.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Elizabeth Villarreal, 15, who lost her $200 eyeglasses
one morning three months ago. Lal went on the school intercom to announce
they were missing. Two hours later, the glasses were returned.</TE>
<TE>Relating as an Immigrant</TE>
<TE>   Lal said he relates to many of his students because he is an immigrant
too. He settled in Glendale at age 13 after an American family sponsored
him to receive an education in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   His introduction to American culture was harsh. He recalled his third
week at the mostly white Roosevelt Middle School, when he stood in line
for lunch and two girls glared at him, then took their trays and walked
away.</TE>
<TE>   "No one had ever seen a person like me," he said. "I was the darkest
person to graduate from Roosevelt and the darkest person to graduate from
Glendale High."</TE>
<TE>   Lal said he realized the only way to get ahead, as a minority who
spoke little English, was to get an education. He went on to become
principal of Carson High and briefly was deputy superintendent for the
state Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Lal, who has a doctorate in education, often substitutes for absent
teachers. During lunch or between classes, he patrols the campus.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, Lal made his way across the newly renovated
courtyard. Students greeted him with "Hi, Doc" or "What's up, Dr. Lal?"
Others shook his hand or gave him a high five.</TE>
<TE>   Stephani Escobar, 17, slipped a senior class photo into his hand. The
handwriting on the back of the picture read: "To Dr. Lal, I really
appreciate what you have done for our school. It has changed a lot. I
hope that I'll be able to work with you more throughout the years."</TE>
<TE>   Tomlinson said that although some may disagree with Lal's aggressive
tactics and his focus on social and environmental improvements, Lal
connects with Jordan students. They know he believes in them.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Lal has lifted the spirits of this place. But he is a no-nonsense
guy," Tomlinson said. "You're either in his boat or you're not. He'll
only tell you one time."</TE>

<HD>'Hair Bandit' Suspect Arrested</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police say they have the man responsible for six recent
assaults. 'Women with long hair can rest easier,' they say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man suspected of being the so-called Hair Bandit was arrested
Tuesday at a Long Beach apartment complex, according to police.</LD>
<LD>   Acting on an anonymous tip, officers arrested Michael Lynn Howard, 47,
about 4:30 p.m. at a building on Pine Avenue., said Long Beach Police
Officer Jana Blair. Howard, who lives in Norwalk, offered no resistance,
Blair said, adding: "Women with long hair can rest easier."</LD>
<LD>   During the last few weeks, Howard is believed to responsible for five
incidents in Long Beach and one in East Los Angeles in which women have
have been grabbed from behind and had chunks of their hair sliced off
with a knife or scissors.</LD>
<TE>   At least four of the victims were Latina. They have ranged in age from
12 to 45, Blair said. One victim, who did not report the attack, was
described by a witness as a young girl who was assaulted at 7:15 a.m. at
Pacific Coast Highway and Chestnut Avenue, Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, Howard was taken to a hospital, where he was treated
for a minor wound to the right side of his head. Authorities believe he
received the injury Monday morning, saying a Los Angeles County sheriff's
deputy fired several shots at Howard after he allegedly tried to run over
the deputy in a 1991 Buick Rivera that had been parked in a nearby alley.</TE>
<TE>   The confrontation began about 8:30 a.m. when the deputy spotted a man,
later identified by a tipster as Howard, holding a woman in a chokehold
at a pay phone in East Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, deputies searched Howard's Norwalk home but have not
disclosed what, if anything, was discovered. The suspect was not home at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's arrest was "pretty non-eventful," Blair said. Also present
in the apartment were a man and woman whose relationship to Howard had
yet to be determined, the officer said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased he's in custody," she said. "Our detectives have
been working all week on this case."</TE>

<HD>For Charities, Aid Comes As Feast, Famine</HD>
<DH>Volunteers: Crowds who pitch in during the holidays largely
disappear the rest of the year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just before serving Thanksgiving dinner on skid row, the volunteers
gathered for their orientation.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm Dick Riordan," the gubernatorial hopeful and former Los Angeles
mayor said with a grin and a wave.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm Bonnie Hunt," the actress said as she prepared to put on an
apron.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm John Tesh," the musician and former "Entertainment Tonight" host
said, wearing jeans for the dirty work.</TE>
<TE>   Thanksgiving and Christmas are the most popular days to help the
homeless, say shelter staffers--so popular that the centers typically
issue invitations to celebrities to take part.</TE>
<TE>   This season, the Los Angeles Mission said it employed 350 volunteers
for its Thanksgiving meal, but turned down 200 volunteers a day in the
two weeks prior to Thanksgiving. The sign-up list for Christmas help was
full at least two weeks in advance.</TE>
<TE>   But although the holidays bring crowds of volunteers descending on the
mission district and the shelters that house and feed the homeless,
during the rest of the year they largely disappear.</TE>
<TE>   The reason, according to staff at the shelters, is partly that the
public shies away when confronted with the everyday realities of skid
row. But another part of the problem is that the centers have few
resources to recruit or process the volunteer effort.</TE>
<TE>   "It might sound strange, but we don't have the help to get help," said
Ray Alvarez, director of the Lamp Day Center.</TE>
<TE>   Keisha Chinn, Los Angeles Mission volunteer director, said there's no
way to answer all 200 calls a day herself, so this year they turned to a
recorded message that said: "We have filled all volunteer positions for
Thanksgiving dinner--including [shifts for] expected cancellations."
Callers interested in helping on other days were directed to another
extension to leave a message.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants to be mean or turn [volunteers] away, but this is what
happens," said Jorja Prover, a UCLA professor who brings students each
quarter to skid row. "We are now in an era when resources for the
homeless are shrinking and the homeless population is not shrinking."</TE>
<TE>   Prover said that bringing in more volunteers would require resources
that the shelters lack. Some of the centers said they simply didn't have
the staff to galvanize a volunteer effort.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez said his staff isn't organized to integrate volunteers. "We
collaborate with UCLA, but everything else seems impossible."</TE>
<TE>   No one questions that the organizations desperately need the services
volunteers would provide.</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Berrera, a 25-year-old who has worked free for the past two
years at the Volunteers of America center on San Julian Street, said, "It
seems like there are never enough volunteers" to do cleanup, laundry and
food preparation or pour coffee.</TE>
<TE>   Three months ago, the paid staff there was cut from 31 members to 21,
program manager Connie Tyson said. The center serves 300 to 400 homeless
people a day with food, shelter and counseling.</TE>
<TE>   When a reporter went to ask what volunteer opportunities were
available, he was initially told they didn't have any.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers of America officials, like those at other centers, say many
people only want to help on Thanksgiving and Christmas, when shelters
don't need all the help that is offered.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the year, "This is a population that a lot of people don't
want to deal with," said Alvarez, whose center has 18 beds, food service
and showers serving about 300 homeless monthly. However, Alvarez said,
the agency has never actively sought volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   At most missions, paid staff members try to do everything with limited
resources. But UCLA's Prover said it is a loss to the homeless as well to
as the communities that want to help them if volunteers don't reach the
needy.</TE>
<TE>   For people who donate their time, Prover said, the rewards are that
the work "demystifies the homeless. They are no longer some abstract
social program."</TE>
<TE>   She said her students form lasting relationships with homeless people
once they've crossed the crucial threshold of becoming part of an
organization that serves them. Without telephone, postal or e-mail
service, the volunteers learn to maintain their relationships with the
homeless in some of the ways that the homeless do themselves: by learning
faces and the schedules people keep.</TE>
<TE>   Yetta Young's job at the Weingart Center is to bring in volunteers who
would come away with that sort of lasting commitment. She registered her
center on Web sites that match volunteers with organizations and began
getting responses from volunteers whom she funneled into jobs at the
center.</TE>
<TE>   The center provides food, education programs and short-term housing
for 642 clients at a time. Since January, Young has built a staff of 30
volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a great need," Young said. "All of the departments need help
and they ask me for it."</TE>
<TE>   When made aware of the Weingart Center's approach to recruiting
volunteers, Alvarez said, "We'd like to move in that direction."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the work of signing up volunteers is often frustrating. Young
said volunteers sometimes make an appointment to see her and then don't
show up. When she checks her phone, "There will be a message from the
person that they came by and saw how bad it is down here and didn't
realize what they were getting themselves into."</TE>
<TE>   Both Young and Prover said prospective volunteers need to do their
homework on what homeless culture is like before offering their help.</TE>
<TE>   Prover suggested that reading information on a few Web sites or in
books can get someone started. Renting videos such as "The Fisher King"
and "The Caveman's Valentine" can also help prospective volunteers, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   For the volunteers who donated their time this Thanksgiving, some said
they were only getting started.</TE>
<TE>   Securities trader Bob Sievers was among the volunteers who joined
celebrities for at the Los Angeles Mission's Thanksgiving meal, where
4,000 homeless people were served. The mission invited his family because
he is a steady donor.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed to the downtown skyscrapers, several blocks away. "I used
to work there, but I never came this far away from the freeway. I never
realized there were so many homeless here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the homeless said volunteers bring a connection to the rest of
the world that paid staff members can't always provide.</TE>
<TE>   Ezell Williams handles publicity for the Los Angeles Mission. He was
once homeless and remembers the Christmas meal in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said his birthday that year passed unnoticed. That is, until
someone mentioned it to radio DJ Shadoe Stevens, who was volunteering on
one of the celebrity days, and Stevens crafted Williams' only birthday
card that year.</TE>
<TE>   "I have it today. . . . I don't think I've ever held onto something
for so long," Williams said.</TE>

<HD>All They Are Saying Is Give L.A.'s Downtown a Chance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ordinarily, I'm a troublemaker, not a peacemaker. That's my job: I
get you good people in a lather over something, and you storm the
citadels of power with pitchforks or e-mails, to put a stop to whatever
it is I got you riled up about.</LD>
<LD>   But just this once, I tried it another way.</LD>
<LD>   Among the recent letters to the editor was one from Lisa Magdaleno, of
Tustin Ranch in Orange County. Lisa had decided to "do something
different" and, two days after Thanksgiving, she drove up to do what L.A.
begs people to do: to shop in downtown, to "stimulate the economy" and
support local shops.</LD>
<TE>   The upshot--Lisa got thrashed. She wound up on skid row, looking for a
working parking meter. When she found one, it ate her money and gave her
back nothing, which only in Vegas passes for fun. The pavement was deep
in drifts of trash. A crazy man bore down on her, gabbling angrily about
an "English-speaking church." Lisa is not a timid woman, but she drove
off to find a safe parking lot. She got lost, and got a ticket for
driving in a bus lane that hadn't been marked as such. Whereupon Lisa
found the nearest freeway and went to Long Beach, where she uneventfully
and pleasantly spent about $300 that could have been L.A.'s dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not plan," she wrote, "to return to Los Angeles to shop or dine
any time soon." And some of the million people who buy this newspaper
read that and said, "She's right--place is a pit."</TE>
<TE>   Two things had to happen: the affront to Lisa's intentions could not
go unanswered, and I had to stick up for downtown, the funny-looking runt
of L.A.'s litter of neighborhoods. This time, I am the peacemaker. Lisa,
come back. Give us another chance. Meet the Honorable Jan Perry, council
member for downtown L.A. Jan, meet Lisa Magdaleno. Charm her. Persuade
her. Change her mind about us.</TE>
<TE>   I set up the blind lunch-date at Pinot, on the grounds of the Central
Library, six blocks and a million miles from where Lisa nearly came to
grief.</TE>
<TE>   They sat across from each other, Lisa and Jan, as Lisa told her tale.
She and her husband have a 7-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son and
they moved to Tustin Ranch because in south Orange County, "every home
looked the same. It's great for some people but for us, we like to look
at beautiful architecture, interesting people. A place like this"--she
gestured out the window--"it's gorgeous, it has character. I like
diversity and I like to see different things."</TE>
<TE>   That's what made the bad trip doubly terrible; "I was so excited,"
says Lisa, "and then I felt just deflated."</TE>
<TE>   Jan Perry can work with this. She'll say later that she was a bit
apprehensive about making L.A.'s case until she saw Lisa, a pretty young
woman dressed in black, and thought, with relief, "loft girl!" She'd
expected someone prim, a bit rigid--"I wasn't sure I could explain it to
you, but now I think I can."</TE>
<TE>   It turns out Lisa is not a hard sell, even after her disastrous
sojourn. Her mother and grandmother used to shop downtown, and from
childhood she remembers the blazing Christmas windows of 7th Street's
vanished grand stores.</TE>
<TE>   Jan too had gazed at the same shining windows in the 1970s, and 25
years later, she is selling Lisa on the glowing alabaster windows of St.
Vibiana's, on its way to becoming an arts center, and on the new
high-tech pay toilets, and her labors to do right by everyone, merchants
and shoppers and loft-folk and the deranged and displaced, and not just
surrender downtown to street people and movie crews.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa is nodding. "That's why I wrote the letter. I discussed it with
my husband and I thought maybe something could happen. I know it's an
overwhelming task."</TE>
<TE>   Jan is nodding now. "People who do what you do should be listened to
because you took the time to raise our level of consciousness."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not about to win the Nobel Peace Prize for setting up a 90-minute
lunch, but I'm feeling pleased at the way things have gone. Jan and Lisa
are exchanging shopping tips--the Mart, the places in Artesia where
Madonna buys saris--and Jan declaims with comic pomposity, "Through
shopping we can solve many of our problems." They pledge to arrange a
shopping date, and a chance, as Jan says, to "show you downtown from my
perspective."</TE>
<TE>   What about the traffic ticket? I ask.</TE>
<TE>   Jan can't fix a ticket, especially not with me sitting there with a
tape recorder, but she can write a letter about the virtues of outreach
and being helpful and giving visitors a positive experience.</TE>
<TE>   And then she is off, the Honorable Ms. Perry, and Lisa and I make our
way out, among the faceted skyscrapers glittering against the
ridiculously blue sky, and as if we're in a movie, and Lisa, in the role
of country ingenue speaking home truths, says her line: "It has so much
potential; it could really be spectacular."</TE>

<HD>Baby a First for Navy Couple, County</HD>
<DH>Beginnings: The child clocks in at 12:52 a.m. New Year's Day in
Oxnard. Her Seabee dad is on hand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Boyce nearly didn't make it home in time to welcome his
daughter, Ventura County's first baby of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   As a Seabee with the naval base at Port Hueneme, he had been stationed
in Okinawa for most of his wife's pregnancy. And after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, there was a strong possibility that he and the rest of
his construction battalion could be shipped to any number of trouble
spots worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   Luckily, orders came through that allowed him to return to Port
Hueneme last month and be on hand Tuesday when Seryna Boyce--all 7
pounds, 11 ounces of her--decided to make her way into the world.</LD>
<TE>   She arrived at 12:52 a.m. on New Year's Day at St. John's Regional
Medical Center in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "When they told us she was the first baby of the year, we were pretty
excited," said Boyce, 20, as the baby, wrapped in a blanket and crowned
with a knitted beanie, lay sleeping in the arms of her mother, Arlene.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know he was coming home," Arlene Boyce, 22, said about her
husband. "He surprised me. But I knew he'd find a way."</TE>
<TE>   The Port Hueneme couple, who met while working at a Riverside pizza
joint and have been married for nearly two years, didn't set out to have
the first baby of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, they were surprised to learn that Arlene was pregnant in May,
just as Steve was preparing to leave for a seven-month tour of duty in
Japan. Even then, Arlene Boyce wasn't due to deliver until today.</TE>
<TE>   But when she went into labor Sunday night, she and her husband thought
Seryna might arrive before the end of the year--an intriguing prospect
because the tax write-off would have come in handy.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get it," Arlene Boyce said of that benefit, "but we got a
famous baby. We got better than that."</TE>
<TE>   So begins a period of diaper changes, late-night feedings and bouts of
teething. The first-time parents admit it will be a departure from the
lives they have known.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Boyce joined the Navy three years ago and plans to make it his
career. Arlene Boyce worked as an assistant manager at an Oxnard jewelry
store but often was able to join her husband for short periods while he
was stationed outside the United States.</TE>
<TE>   They have had plenty of friends and lots of good times.</TE>
<TE>   Now the focus will be their two-bedroom house on the Navy base, where
they have set up a nursery.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be different, but it feels really good," said Arlene
Boyce, who at least for the next 10 months is assured that her husband
will stay in Port Hueneme and be able to help with the baby.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just a whole new life ahead," she said. "It's going to be
great."</TE>

<HD>Child Safety Seat Sales Brisk as New Law Ups Age</HD>
<DH>Regulations: Senate bill goes into effect this week, requiring the
restraints for those under 6 years or under 60 pounds. Violators will
face fines of $100 for a first offense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN GRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a year restrained only by seat belts when he was in a car, 4
1/2-year-old Shane Falzon of Camarillo returned Tuesday to the snug
confines of a child safety seat. And he couldn't be happier.</LD>
<LD>   "I told him a month and a half ago that he would have to go back to a
car seat at the beginning of the year and he was all excited," said
Shane's mother, Cheryl Falzon. "When New Year's came and he didn't have a
booster seat, he said, 'Where is my seat?' "</LD>
<LD>   Senate Bill 42, which went into effect Tuesday, requires that children
be secured in a child safety seat or booster seat until they are 6 years
old or weigh 60 pounds. Previously, children could forgo safety seats
once they turned 4 or reached 40 pounds.</LD>
<TE>   Shane was one of the children affected be the law. So Falzon took him
to Wal-Mart in Oxnard on Tuesday, where he eagerly picked out a booster
seat with a cup holder.</TE>
<TE>   "How long that excitement is going to last, I don't know," Falzon
said.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers who violate the law can be fined $100 for a first offense and
$250 for a second.</TE>
<TE>   California Highway Patrol Sgt. Doug Howell said officers have been
instructed to begin issuing tickets immediately to drivers who don't
restrain older children in car seats. They can give warnings to people
who have children in the wrong type of seat or don't use seats properly.</TE>
<TE>   Howell did not know Tuesday if any tickets had been issued.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by booster seat sales, people were rushing to comply with the
law by Jan. 1. While Babies R Us in Oxnard has been selling about 15%
more of the seats than usual since October, the real rush came Monday,
said assistant manager Cassie Maldonado.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people who came in said they needed a booster seat," Maldonado
said. "They were flying off the shelf."</TE>
<TE>   Maldonado and Boake Terry, manager of Wal-Mart in Oxnard, where
booster seat sales have also been brisk, both said they didn't hear any
parents complaining about the new law.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents are sold," Maldonado said. "A lot of times it's the child
who isn't particularly excited."</TE>
<TE>   Booster seats with cup holders, like the one Shane picked out, were
top sellers as parents trying to persuade their children that returning
to a car seat would be fun let their kids pick which model to buy,
Maldonado said.</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Falzon thinks it is a good law. She knew shoulder belts didn't
fit Shane right before, but she just tucked them behind his arm.</TE>
<TE>   "It forces people like me into doing what they should," Falzon said.
"And since it's a law, I can tell him it's a rule."</TE>
<TE>   Howell said the new law targets a high-risk group.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics show that traffic crashes are the leading cause of death in
children ages 4 to 16. Although 47% of the children ages 4 to 7 who are
killed in car accidents are completely unrestrained, many of those who
wear seat belts are also at risk, Howell said, because a shoulder harness
or lap belt that doesn't fit right can cause injuries. Only 6% of 4- to
6-year-olds had been using booster seats before the new law.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully," Howell said, "it will enhance the safety of those kids
who can't think for themselves."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A blood drive is scheduled to boost county reserves, which are
expected to dwindle after the holidays.</LD>
<LD>   A mobile unit operated by United Blood Services of Ventura County will
be at the Boys &amp; Girls Club on Jan. 9 from 2:30 to 6:30 p.m. Donors must
weigh at least 110 and be at least 17 years old.</LD>
<LD>   The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks spurred an unprecedented number of
donations, said Carolyn Tyner, the blood service's executive director.
However, she expected there to be just 2 1/2 days' worth of reserves
after New Year's Day.</LD>
<TE>   The service, which runs the county's only blood bank, tries to
maintain reserves for five to seven days.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hopeful we'll be able to sustain some of the enthusiasm
resulting from our opportunity to be patriotic citizens," Tyner said.</TE>
<TE>   To make an appointment, sign up at the Boys &amp; Girls Club at 2850 Lemon
Drive or call the club at 527-4437.</TE>

<HD>Seabee Is Killed by Police Car</HD>
<DH>Accident: Oxnard cruiser was on a call when it hit the sailor
crossing Ventura Road.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 20-year-old Seabee was struck and killed by an Oxnard police car
responding to a call early Tuesday as the sailor attempted to cross
Ventura Road.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Shubert of Pembroke, Mass., died at the scene after the
collision, which occurred about 4:20 a.m., officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Humberto Jimenez, a 16-year veteran of the Police Department,
was alone in the car at the time. Jimenez was treated for minor injuries
at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard and released, officials
said.</LD>
<TE>   Shubert was crossing Ventura Road mid-block, just north of Channel
Islands Boulevard and about 100 feet north of the crosswalk, when he was
struck by Jimenez's patrol car, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Just before the accident, Shubert had been having a meal with seven
members of his battalion at a nearby restaurant. He left to buy a pack of
cigarettes at a store across the four-lane Ventura Road.</TE>
<TE>   As he returned, Shubert was hit by the southbound police cruiser, said
Officer Steven Funk.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never know why he decided to go that route," Funk said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Shubert's unit at the naval base said they were stunned.</TE>
<TE>   Shubert was athletic and enjoyed playing racquetball, said Steve
Boyce, a member of the unit. One of Shubert's main jobs during a recent
deployment to Okinawa, Boyce said, was making sure that living areas were
up to military code.</TE>
<TE>   Boyce, whose wife, Arlene, gave birth to the first child born in 2002
in Ventura County, described Shubert as "someone you always wanted to
have around."</TE>
<TE>   "His poor family," Boyce said. "They're all so far away. He should
have been home with them for the new year."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said preliminary findings indicate that Shubert hit the
front driver's side of the car above the wheel well and was tossed onto
the windshield.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the collision, Jimenez was on his way to assist another
officer on a domestic disturbance call in south Oxnard, Funk said.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard police did not say how fast Jimenez was traveling, but the
collision knocked Shubert out of his shoes and carried him about 100 feet
into a crosswalk at the intersection of Ventura Road and Channel Islands
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   He died of head and chest injuries, said Armando Chavez, senior deputy
medical examiner.</TE>
<TE>   More than seven hours after the collision, investigators from the
California Highway Patrol and the Oxnard Police Department were still
collecting evidence at the scene. The intersection, which is adjacent to
Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme, where Shubert was stationed,
remained closed to traffic in both directions until about noon.</TE>
<TE>   The dented patrol car, with its smashed-in windshield, remained near
the intersection. CHP officials said it will take at least a week for
them to complete the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The death was the only fatality on Ventura County roadways over the
long holiday weekend, officials said. The Ventura County office of the
CHP made 29 arrests for driving under the influence between 6 p.m. Friday
and Tuesday evening.</TE>
<TE>   Shubert was a utilities constructionman stationed with Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion 5 at the Port Hueneme base, said spokeswoman Teri
Reid. He returned in December from a six-month deployment in Okinawa with
the other 600 people in his unit, the spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The fatality was the first involving base military personnel since
March of 2000, when 30-year-old Patrick Sulit Nazareno, an electronics
technician at the Port Hueneme base, was killed after losing control of
his Acura on Potrero Road in Camarillo, Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   Petty Officer 1st Class Johnny Shields, Shubert's platoon commander,
said the sailor "will definitely be missed in the platoon. He had a great
future."</TE>

<HD>Crews Continue Mop-Up of Placentia-Area Oil Spill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cleanup crews worked all day Tuesday mopping up a Placentia oil
spill that leaked 400 to 800 gallons of crude into storm drains, creeks
and the Santa Ana River, soiling a handful of birds and miles of
vegetation.</LD>
<LD>   By Tuesday evening, state officials reported that nearly 80% of the
spill had been cleaned up but said the job will be completed no sooner
than Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "Will we get it all? I'd have to say, 'No,' " said Lt. Mark Caywood of
the California Department of Fish and Game's Office of Spill Prevention
and Response. "We're working real hard, though, to pick up as much of it
as we can."</LD>
<TE>   The spill, which originated near an oil field in the 1400 block of
Garcia Place in Placentia, was discovered about 10 a.m. Sunday. The slick
traveled southwest about four miles, through storm drains and creeks,
before the bulk of it was contained in north Anaheim at Carbon Creek and
the Atwood Channel. Some of the oil reached the Santa Ana River farther
south in the form of a bright sheen roughly 100 yards long.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the spill came within yards of Orange County Water
District holding ponds. "I'd say this spill will have a negligible effect
on any ground-water situation," said Ron Wildermuth, spokesman for the
water district.</TE>
<TE>   Injured wildlife included two grebes and a mallard that were found
"heavily oiled" and sent to a wildlife station for cleaning up and care.
"They're still alive and being treated," Caywood said. "We got to them
pretty quickly."</TE>
<TE>   That was not the case for at least two egrets that were seen spotted
with oil near the cleanup. They have so far eluded capture.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to treat them, we have to catch them," Caywood said. "The
egrets haven't necessarily signed on to that plan yet."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental officers will have to wait until the birds become ill
and cannot escape before they can be sent to the Oil Wildlife Care
Network station in San Pedro, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The cleanup involves about 60 people, mostly private contractors. In
addition to the birds, roughly 100 cubic yards of vegetation were soiled.
Workers must cut down the damaged plants and haul them away.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the spill remains under investigation, but authorities
said it appears that a pipeline that gathers oil at a drilling site
overflowed. Benchmark Corp. of Placentia, which owns the oil field, is
participating in the cleanup and will be required to help pay for it,
Caywood said. A cost estimate was not available Tuesday night.</TE>

<HD>Rackauckas Challenger's Greatest Ally? Rackauckas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA PARSONS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Other than the Orange County Grand Jury taking a look at how he
runs his office, it was a good week for Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas. A
few more good weeks like that, and he'll be looking for a new job by
spring.</LD>
<LD>   Challenger Wally Wade must be living right. The way things are
breaking for him so far, his best campaign strategy might be to say
nothing and just wait for the next shoe to drop on Rackauckas.</LD>
<LD>   Wade is the veteran prosecutor Rackauckas soundly whipped in 1998 when
both ran for the open seat. For lots of reasons, it's no easy task in
Orange County to unseat an incumbent district attorney, and Wade has to
make up more than 80,000 votes, the margin he lost by four years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Under normal circumstances, he could forget it.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas, however, has shown an uncanny knack for drumming up
controversy. A district attorney generally flies below the radar screen;
Rackauckas has painted a bright red target on himself.</TE>
<TE>   A grand jury taking testimony about the district attorney's office?
You think Wade maybe, just maybe, could find a way to make that a
campaign issue?</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas was lying low last week when the grand jury story came out.
A supervisor in his office played it down, saying it was just a routine
examination.</TE>
<TE>   Not likely.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, it's a lose-lose proposition for Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing comes of the grand jury's inquiry, Wade still makes
political hay out of why it was undertaken in the first place. And if any
admonishment comes from the panel, it could be lights out for Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if the grand jury were Rackauckas' only irritant. . . .</TE>
<TE>   Rather, earlier last month, the association representing the deputy
attorneys in the district attorney's office endorsed Wade. That followed
an earlier endorsement from the Orange County Attorneys Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Most voters probably didn't know either association existed, but Wade
will be sure to alert them. You don't have to be a marketing genius to
picture a TV ad or mailer touting both votes.</TE>
<TE>   Again, Rackauckas is snookered. The truth is that the vote totals
weren't released from either poll, so we don't know whether Wade won the
endorsements by one vote or 100. Or even if 100 people voted.</TE>
<TE>   But Wade can legitimately note, as he already has, that it's the first
time neither association endorsed the incumbent district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   A retired deputy district attorney, who says he supports neither
candidate, agrees that Rackauckas could be hurt by perception. He was
answering my question about how voters could make an informed decision in
a race that doesn't get a lot of publicity.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't, unless they take a couple weeks off from their jobs and
start investigating it themselves," he says. "Even then, they're going to
have to talk to a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Conceding that most people won't do that, they'll likely pay attention
to endorsements from people supposedly in the know, he says.</TE>
<TE>   With the March 5 election in sight, Rackauckas needs an offense. For
an incumbent with history on his side, he has played nothing but defense.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the only person off to a slower start in the campaign is me:
I wrote last month that, after winning the 1998 election, Rackauckas put
Wade in charge of the consumer fraud division in the office.</TE>
<TE>   Elementary logic should have told me a victor wouldn't give the
vanquished such a job. The truth is that Wade was assigned to the welfare
fraud division and has never headed consumer fraud. He was among many who
alerted me to my blunder. "Thanks for the promotion," he said, wryly.</TE>
<TE>   The point is, goof-ups happen.</TE>
<TE>   Although I'd like the grand jury to investigate how I made my blunder,
they aren't.</TE>
<TE>   No, the only person who has a grand jury on his back is the incumbent
district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Wally Wade continues smiling like the Cheshire cat and
wondering how long his good luck will hold.</TE>

<HD>O.C.'s 1st Baby of 2002 Is Late Christmas Gift</HD>
<DH>Families: Santa Ana woman gives birth to a boy at 12:19 a.m. New
Year's Day, a week after his due date.</DH>

<LD>Jesus Cruz wanted to capture the moment of his first child's birth,
so he left his wife, Yazmin, at the hospital and raced home to grab his
camera an hour before the new year.</LD>
<LD>   Dad made it back in time to see son James become Orange County's first
baby of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   But he didn't get the shot--he left the camera in the car.</LD>
<TE>   James, all 8 pounds, 3 ounces and 21 inches of him, was born at 12:19
a.m. at Santa Ana Hospital Medical Center, a week after his Christmas Eve
due date. He and his mom, who also has a 5-year-old son, are doing fine.</TE>
<TE>   "That's your Christmas gift," Yazmin Cruz, 24, had told her
20-year-old husband, a shift leader at a Jack in the Box restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Santa Ana couple received a New Year's gift.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't really matter," Jesus Cruz said. "I just wanted him to be
here."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after James was born, Orange County's first twins of 2002
entered the world by emergency caesarean section at St. Jude Medical
Center in Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Peyton Renee Steen--3 pounds, 7 ounces, 15 1/2 inches--arrived at
12:25 a.m. She was followed a minute later by Megan Denise at 2 pounds,
11 ounces and 14 inches.</TE>
<TE>   The girls, who were born early at 33 weeks, were fine but under
observation in the hospital's neonatal intensive-care unit, hospital
officials said. The twins are the first children for Jake and Shannon
Steen of Anaheim Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "They're excellent," said Jake Steen, 29, who works in finance. "It's
a great thing of nature."</TE>
<TE>   He said his wife, a 30-year-old dance instructor, had been on bed rest
for the last several weeks to prevent labor.</TE>
<TE>   "So we were ready for this," he said. "If you're ever ready for this."</TE>

<LD>Habitat for Humanity of Ventura County will usher in the new year
with a new executive director.</LD>
<LD>   Annette Houchin, 38, who worked as the nonprofit group's business
manager the last five years, will replace Martin Kircher, who resigned in
December after 10 months on the job.</LD>
<LD>   To cut costs, Houchin also will continue to manage day-to-day
finances. Like many Ventura County nonprofits, the Oxnard-based group saw
a dip in donations after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Habitat for Humanity has built homes for 23 families in Ventura County
since receiving its first land donation in 1993. The group's latest
project is a 22-home development on 4 1/2 acres in Piru.</TE>

<HD>For Decades, His Will Has Led the Y</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eighty-seven-year-old Bob Mercer is an inspiration to employees and
members of the Mid Valley branch of the YMCA in Van Nuys, where he has
volunteered for 56 years. He passed on his dedication to his son, David,
who in 1989 became the YMCA's national director.</LD>
<LD>   Fit and lean, the 6-foot, 150-pound elder Mercer works out three times
a week at the Y in Van Nuys and spends hundreds of hours a year
volunteering and raising money for the nonprofit community service
organization.</LD>
<LD>   "Lately, I just call people and tell them it's that time of year to
help out," Mercer said recently. "The Y is funded 90% by people who use
the Y, but the last 10% is vital, and that comes from donations. To me,
the Y means good, meaningful programs that benefit people's lives."</LD>
<TE>   Mercer joined the YMCA at the age of 9 in his hometown of Seattle,
going to camps and taking swimming lessons. When his family moved to
Glendale in the 1930s, he strayed from the Y for a decade. Eventually, he
landed a job at Lockheed in Burbank, where he worked as a manager for 41
years.</TE>
<TE>   He rejoined the YMCA in 1945, and began volunteering. He started the
first Indian Guides program in the West, said Ruben Corona, executive
director of the Mid Valley branch. Mercer said he started the local
program to spend more time with David, who was 7. David's involvement in
Indian Guides, which is based on respect for strong family and community
ties, sent him on a career path that led to his selection as national
executive director.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad was the big influence that got me started," said David Mercer,
63, who retired two years ago. "My dad has spent so much time
volunteering at the Y because he believes the Y does a lot of good for
the community and produced a great career for his son."</TE>
<TE>   Besides his work with the Indian Guides, the elder Mercer has spent
countless hours taking children to sporting events and operating a
Christmas tree lot that earned thousands of dollars for the YMCA.</TE>
<TE>   These days, his main task is raising money and providing amenities for
the Mid Valley branch on Lennox Avenue, which has more than 6,000
members, Corona said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the other day," said Eva Reifschneider, the family program
director, "I told him the new ladies' locker room was nice but kind of
drab. The next day he brought in a bunch of colorful framed prints for
us. His heart is into the YMCA. He cares."</TE>

<LD>A man who fired shots at police surrendered early Tuesday after
refusing to leave a house for several hours, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The man, whose name was not released, brandished a gun after a traffic
accident about 6:45 p.m. Monday at Glenoaks Boulevard and Hubbard Street
in San Fernando, said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Ken Buscarino. The man
fled, and when police tried to stop him, he led them on a 45-minute
chase.</LD>
<LD>   The man fired at officers near Foothill Boulevard and Osborne Street.
Police shot back, but no one was hit. Then the man broke into an
unoccupied home and stayed inside until SWAT team members coaxed him out
around midnight.</LD>
<TE>   He was arrested on several counts, including suspicion of assault with
a deadly weapon, and booked at the Van Nuys Jail, Buscarino said.</TE>

<HD>City Offers 14 Sites for Free Recycling of Christmas Trees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Los Angeles will have 14 drop-off sites for Christmas
tree recycling, beginning Saturday, for residents who do not have
curbside collection. The free sites will be open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on
Saturday and Sunday, and Jan. 12 and 13.</LD>
<LD>   "The sites are intended for apartment dwellers or for people who don't
have room in their green container," said Robert O. Reed of the Los
Angeles Department of Public Works. "Rather than leave it at the curb,
which is a fire hazard, we ask them to take it to one of the sites."</LD>
<LD>   There are two new drop-off sites this year. Boyle Heights residents
may take their Christmas trees to the Hollenbeck Recreation Center at 415
S. St. Louis St. In Venice, trees may be dropped off at the Oakwood
Recreation Center, 767 California Ave.</LD>
<TE>   The dozen existing locations that have been operating since the
Christmas tree recycling program started in 1990 are:</TE>
<TE>   * Balboa Sports Center, 17015 Burbank Blvd., Encino.</TE>
<TE>   * Branford Park, 13300 Branford St., Arleta.</TE>
<TE>   * Chatsworth Park South, 22360 Devonshire St., Chatsworth.</TE>
<TE>   * Cheviot Hills Recreation Center, 2551 Motor Ave., Rancho Park.</TE>
<TE>   * Harbor Regional Park, 25820 Vermont Ave., Harbor City.</TE>
<TE>   * Highland Park Senior Citizen's Center, 6200 York Blvd., Highland
Park.</TE>
<TE>   * Hollywood Bowl, 2301 N. Highland Blvd., Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles Zoo, 5333 Zoo Drive, Griffith Park.</TE>
<TE>   * Rancho Cienega Recreation Center, 5001 Rodeo Road, Crenshaw
District.</TE>
<TE>   * South Park, 345 E. 51st St., South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   * Sunland Park, 8651 Foothill Blvd., Sunland.</TE>
<TE>   * Westchester Municipal Building, 7166 W. Manchester Ave.,
Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   Residents with curbside collection must remove all decorations, tinsel
and the stand, and cut the trees in half before putting them in the green
containers. The trees will be turned into mulch and used as ground
covering on city street medians, parks and golf courses.</TE>
<TE>   For more information on the tree recycling program, call the 24-hour
hotline at (800) 587-3356.</TE>

<HD>Costly, Contentious Races for Supervisor and D.A. Shaping Up in
Ventura County</HD>
<DH>Primary: A slew of largely unknown candidates will vie for clerk
and assessor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Campaigns for district attorney and supervisor are expected to be
among the most contentious and costly in Ventura County this political
season, while a host of mostly unknown candidates seeks to fill open
seats for county clerk and tax assessor.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 election year kicks into high gear this month, as county,
state and congressional candidates prepare for the March 5 primary
election.</LD>
<LD>   In a county that prides itself on low crime, Dist. Atty. Michael D.
Bradbury's departure after a quarter of a century on the job has set off
the biggest local contest of the year.</LD>
<TE>   Bradbury's choice as his successor is Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Greg
Totten, 47, who has worked as a prosecutor and an administrator in the
district attorney's office for 17 years.</TE>
<TE>   His challenger is Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Bamieh, an aggressive
young prosecutor and the son of a well-connected Republican campaign
contributor who counts former President George Bush among his friends.
Bamieh, 35, joined the office in 1993, and previously worked as an
assistant chief deputy at the U.S. Department of Justice.</TE>
<TE>   Totten said he expects to be outspent 5 to 1. Bamieh said he would not
apologize for an aggressive campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "With high spending, they're going to be in everyone's face," said
Herb Gooch, chairman of the political science department at Cal Lutheran
University.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the retirement of conservative two-term Supervisor Frank
Schillo could affect the county's growth and development policies.
Schillo's district encompasses Thousand Oaks and most of the Conejo
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Linda Parks, a staunch environmentalist,
will face millionaire businessman Randy Hoffman, who is also campaigning
as a slow-growth candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Judy Mikels, who represents Simi Valley and Moorpark, faces
a challenge from John Lane of Moorpark. Though Lane, a fraud investigator
in the Los Angeles city attorney's office, is not well known in the
county, he is backed by the sheriff's deputies union, which has attacked
Mikels for not ushering through a massive benefits package.</TE>
<TE>   In other county races, the retirements of veteran county Clerk Richard
Dean and Treasurer-Tax Collector Harold S. Pittman have attracted
numerous candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Six have lined up for Dean's post: Assistant County Recorder Philip J.
Schmit; Oxnard City Clerk Daniel Martinez; Moorpark lawyer Michael H.
Wesner; Ventura County Board of Education Trustee Yvonne Gallegos Bodle;
Simi Valley businessman John Reid; and local Republican Party leader
Jackie Rodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Treasurer-Tax Collector Larry Matheny and former Thousand
Oaks Councilman Mike Markey, a loan officer, will compete for Pittman's
post.</TE>
<TE>   Most challenges to incumbents at the state and congressional levels
are not expected to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "The redistricting has just taken the element of competition out of
all of these races," said Jere Robings, a local taxpayer advocate who is
supporting Camarillo businesswoman Beth Rogers' bid for Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "It's locked in to the point that in some cases, it's even hard to
find people to run a race," Robings said. "The incumbents love it, but
politically, the people don't benefit. It's beneficial for the public to
have discourse on issues and strong competition."</TE>
<TE>   Assembly members Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), Keith Richman
(R-Northridge) and Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) face no competition until
the Nov. 5 general election. The same is true for Reps. Lois Capps
(D-Santa Barbara) and Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley).</TE>
<TE>   State Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark) faces a primary
challenge from a Los Angeles County businessman whose rural town was
drawn into the 37th Assembly District as a result of last year's
redistricting.</TE>
<TE>   James F. Duzick, 56, president of the Agua Dulce Town Council and
owner of an aerospace instrumentation company, said the redistricting
process was so confusing that he didn't realize until after he had filled
out the paperwork that he would be taking on a Ventura County-based
incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   In other legislative races, Rogers and Grover Beach physician Donald
Regan will compete in a Republican primary for the chance to challenge
Capps for Congress in November.</TE>
<TE>   And singer-songwriter Ellie Michaels of Thousand Oaks will challenge
state Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa Cruz) in the GOP primary for
lieutenant governor.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Schools Seek to Upgrade Facilities</HD>
<DH>Education: New rule making it easier to pass bond measures prompts
seven districts to place proposals on ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teachers and parents in the Anaheim City School District would love
to end the staggered scheduling that has many students arriving in shifts
and shuffling between classes to make limited seating work for everyone.</LD>
<LD>   That's one reason the district is seeking a $111-million bond measure,
despite the fact that a similar effort failed a few years ago with a 55%
yes vote. Another reason: A change in election rules means that same
percentage now would be a winning majority.</LD>
<LD>   Until this year, school bonds required a two-thirds majority from the
voters. But Proposition 39, passed by them last year, reduced that to
55%.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the new rule has prompted seven Orange County districts to
place bond measures, totaling $731.6 million, on the March 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds will be sought by three elementary school systems, two high
school districts, a unified school district and the North Orange
Community College District, which includes Fullerton and Cypress
colleges.</TE>
<TE>   If all the bond measures pass, that would mean more than $1 billion
for school construction and repair work because all the districts would
qualify for some matching state money.</TE>
<TE>   "We're confident the public wants good schools, and our kids deserve
it," said Gary Rutherford, superintendent of the Huntington Beach City
School District.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, a $30-million bond issue for Rutherford's schools failed
with 62% approval. Now the district is retooling its proposal and will
try again in March.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the seven districts' bond money would go for new facilities to
house growing enrollment. But for many older schools, long-delayed
repairs are in order.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got classrooms with just one electrical outlet," Rutherford
said. "That won't accommodate today's teaching methods, where you need
plenty of places to plug in computers."</TE>
<TE>   In some parts of the county, though, the number of school bond
measures could make voters balk. Some voters in Fullerton and Anaheim
will face several bond issues on the same ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The bond in Huntington Beach would cost voters $16 annually for each
$100,000 of assessed property valuation. But Anaheim voters are being
asked to support three bonds--for a total of $78.50 above their current
tax for every $100,000 of assessed valuation--for the city schools, the
high school district and the North Orange County Community College
District. Fullerton residents must also vote on three bond measures, for
a total of $68.25 per $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   School officials are aware that some voters might bristle at the
lineup of bond measures.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't have a choice; we need the money," said Cameron McCune,
superintendent of the Fullerton School District, which has nearly 20
elementary schools.</TE>
<TE>   The Anaheim Union High School District isn't taking chances.
Volunteers there have already conducted telephone campaigns to lobby
voters and make them aware that the issue is on the March ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition groups in Fullerton and Anaheim have filed campaign
statements against the bonds, which will go out with the sample ballots.
In Huntington Beach, five people signed a statement opposing the bond
measure.</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim, a group called Homeowners Maintaining Their Environment
wrote in its campaign statement that taxpayers should not have to pay for
mismanagement by school leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "Giving these wasteful school administrators more of our money is not
the answer. . . . For years, funds that could have been spent on building
maintenance were used instead to hire more administrative personnel and
give fat pay increases to nonteaching staff members," the statement
reads.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the bond measures could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Until Proposition 13 in 1978, school districts did not need voter
approval for bonds. Their boards had the power to impose tax hikes. But
Proposition 13 changed that and led to the two-thirds majority
requirement for any tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a look at the seven districts and how they want to spend
construction bond money.</TE>
<TE>   * The Anaheim City School District seeks $111 million for an ambitious
10-year plan that includes four new schools to alleviate crowding and
eliminate staggered schedules. It also would construct two-story
classroom buildings at Horace Mann and Abraham Lincoln elementary
schools, two of its older campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The district has more than 22,000 students in schools designed to hold
11,000. It gets by with portable classroom units and staggered classes.</TE>
<TE>   The district's Sunkist Elementary, built for 500 students, now has an
enrollment of 1,200. The campus' 57 regular teachers share 33 classrooms,
including eight portables. The school operates year round on a staggered
daily schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Because there is no cafeteria, students pick up their lunches from a
serving table outside, rain or shine, and carry the food to whichever
classroom is empty at the time. For assemblies, the children carry their
classroom seats to an asphalt area outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds, even with matching money from the state, wouldn't end
year-round schools. But spokeswoman Suzanne Brown said eliminating
staggered classes is a priority in surveys of parents. "If their children
are in the later classes, it's often difficult to fit in with their work
schedules," she said.</TE>
<TE>   * The Anaheim Union High School District seeks $132 million for
renovations at all of its schools and would add a junior high school. If
it can get its bond measure passed, it also can qualify for $125 million
in state money.</TE>
<TE>   "Our students are trying to compete with school systems which already
have advanced technology," Supt. Jan Billings said. "We must make major
changes in our classrooms--get our students out of those portables--if
we're going to keep up."</TE>
<TE>   The district has 33,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   * The Fullerton Joint Union High School District, with 15,000
students, seeks $67.9 million to add 18,000-square-foot classroom
buildings at each of its six comprehensive high schools. Each would
include a new library.</TE>
<TE>   * The Fullerton School District, with 13,400 students, seeks $49.7
million to build an elementary school for the new Amerige Heights
residential development at the old Hughes Aircraft property near Malvern
Avenue and Gilbert Street.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the rest of the money would be used to upgrade the other
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got sewer lines so old they've got roots growing in them,"

<TE>   * The Huntington Beach City School District, with 13,500 students,

<HD>Programs Help Train Young Fathers in Parenthood and Cultural
Heritage</HD>
<DH>Services: The lessons and mentoring are directed at ethnic groups
that often lack role models in their own upbringing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 17, Eric Cota was like a lot of guys his age, concerned mainly
with hanging out late at night and flirting with girls in his Montebello
neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   At 19, he is part of a brotherhood of a different sort. As the young
father of a 2 1/2-year-old son, he is learning that the impetuosity of
youth can hasten the responsibilities of adulthood.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike members of previous generations of young men in his position,
though, Cota has gotten help in his transition from imprudent teenager to
caring father through the efforts of a parenting education and mentoring
program called Con Los Padres. The state-funded program is geared to
fathers between the ages of 16 to 25.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like having someone, a father figure, that's never been there
for me before," said Cota of the men in the program who have become his
role models. He was interviewed in the tidy house he shares with his
mother and sister. Since his girlfriend Maribel, mother of little Eric
Jose, lives next door, Cota, who works in construction, sees his son
every day and can apply many of the lessons he's learned.</TE>
<TE>   Con Los Padres is one of dozens of programs established in California
and the nation in recent years that focus on an often neglected factor in
the teen pregnancy equation: the sexuality of young men and their
importance in the development and well-being of their children.</TE>
<TE>Importance of Being Involved in Child's Life</TE>
<TE>   The programs' wide-ranging goals include teaching young men the
importance of being involved in their children's lives; instruction about
their rights and responsibilities such as child support, birth control,
custody, visitation and paternity; even education and vocational
training. Many programs are tailored to Latino, African American or other
ethnic groups to enhance cultural identity. Their messages are being
reinforced through billboard and media campaigns in California and other
states, with eye-catching slogans in English and Spanish such as "Being a
Dad Means Being There" and "Fatherhood Is Forever.'</TE>
<TE>   "Our culture is finally starting to recognize, understand and
appreciate fathers' involvement [with their children]," said Roland
Warren, president of the National Fatherhood Initiative, a Maryland-based
nonprofit created to promote responsible fatherhood. The group's latest
project, called Doctor Dad, is aimed at helping teen fathers handle
health care issues for their infants and toddlers.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Con Los Padres, California is funding 24 other programs in
one of the largest efforts to reach young men in schools, juvenile
detention centers, sports programs, group homes and churches.</TE>
<TE>   In the last four years, more than 30,000 young men have participated
in the programs statewide. Some who have been in trouble with the law are
referred to the programs by courts as a condition of probation. But many
come voluntarily, hearing of the programs through word-of-mouth or
advertising.</TE>
<TE>   A state evaluation found that the programs seem to be working and that
participants increased their knowledge about sex, birth control,
pregnancy and California's statutory rape laws. According to
participants, their average age of first intercourse was 13 and fewer
than half were using any birth control at the time when they first
enrolled in the parenting classes.</TE>
<TE>   One key to reaching young men, say Warren and other experts, is to
emphasize jobs, academics, personal safety and other issues tailored to
specific communities.</TE>
<TE>   For example, at Con Los Padres, which is sponsored by Community and
Mission Hospitals of Huntington Park and the Bienvenidos Family Services,
young men get weekly lessons in Latino cultural heritage as well as
fatherhood training as part of the 20-week program.</TE>
<TE>   And in Long Beach, the Role of Men program's "Proud Fathers of the
Hood" is designed to cut the high infant mortality rate in that city's
African American community by targeting young men who are expectant
fathers or have children under age 2.</TE>
<TE>   "From the time a young lady says she's pregnant, the response of the
father can determine the health of the baby and mother," said program
supervisor David Hillman Jr. "We can talk to teen dads about what the
three trimesters are and what to expect. And we can point out that they
might not be able to play basketball or hang out with their buddies all
the time anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The Role of Men offers inducements such as free diapers, baby
clothing, even tickets to special events to continue in the program and
attend prenatal doctor's visits.</TE>
<TE>What He's Learned Has Been Invaluable to Him</TE>
<TE>   Lawayne Wilson, 22, was attracted by the offer of gift certificates to
help his struggling family get by and has been with the program for two
months. He and his girlfriend are the parents of 1-year-old Ahlik and
Ahliyah, 6. Wilson said that although his own father was actively
involved in his life, what he's learned in the program has been
invaluable.</TE>
<TE>   "Like the correct way to discipline your kids and making sure you
don't come into conflict with your significant other while trying to
raise the children," said Wilson, who was hard-pressed to keep up with
the energetic Ahlik during an interview at the program offices. "He's
into everything. He likes to watch and touch. He's like a sponge, whereas
Ahliyah likes to ask questions, to listen and to learn. That's one of the
things the program taught me: that being a good father is spending time
with your children and finding out what they want to know."</TE>
<TE>   Programs such as Role of Men and Con Los Padres draw on an
indisputable reality: Millions of young boys, rich and poor and of all
ethnicities, are growing up in households with no one on which to pattern
themselves as men and fathers.</TE>
<TE>   A spate of legislation introduced last year in Congress sought to
address the issue, including a House bill that would provide grants to
public and nonprofit agencies to establish new fatherhood programs and
media campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional measures quoted government statistics that paint an
alarming picture of the American family:</TE>
<TE>   * Nearly 50% of all children born in the United States spend at least
half of their childhood in families without full-time father figures.</TE>
<TE>   * Children who are raised without their fathers account for 63% of
youth suicides, 71% of pregnant teenagers, 90% of homeless and runaway
children, 85% of behavioral disorders exhibited by children and 71% of
high school dropouts.</TE>
<TE>   * Forty percent of children who live in fatherless households in the
United States have not seen their fathers in at least one year, and 50%
of such children have never visited their fathers' homes.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to remedy some of those numbers is a key goal of the L.A.
Fathers Collaborative, which includes Role of Men, Bienvenidos Family
Services, the Los Angeles County Child Support Services Department and
other agencies. Fatherhood programs in the collaborative receive federal,
state and private funding as part of a special pilot project.</TE>
<TE>   Building bridges to young fathers is especially important for the
county's child support agency, which is trying to change its image from
one of punitive law enforcer to a more friendly supporter, said Linda
Jenkins, who supervises the program.</TE>
<TE>   Young men enrolled in fatherhood programs, for example, can have their
child support payments suspended until they find a job. The county agency
also works with community-based programs to help young men gain custody
and visitation rights.</TE>
<TE>'Program Is Like Having a Free Lawyer'</TE>
<TE>   Alvin Wesselhoft, 22, enrolled in the Role of Men program, said he is
trying to be a good father to 4-month-old Maylasa Jones while the program
is helping him to establish visitation rights with his 6-year-old son
from a previous relationship, Alvin III, who was born the day before
Wesselhoft turned 18.</TE>
<TE>   He said the boy's mother and new boyfriend moved out of the area
without telling him and have restricted his access to his son.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no one there to tell me you're supposed to do this or
that," said Wesselhoft, cuddling little Maylasa. "But the program is like
having a free lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   Wesselhoft said he is passing on to his 18-year-old brother the
biggest lesson he's learned--to postpone fatherhood until he's more
mature and settled in life.</TE>
<TE>   Said Wesselhoft: "I tell him, 'Don't put yourself in my position.' "</TE>
<TE>   'It's like having someone, a father figure, that's never been there
for me before.'</TE>

<HD>Bighorns Being Fenced Out to Save Their Lives</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Rancho Mirage officials are building a 3 1/2-mile barrier
to keep two small, dwindling herds away from civilization's dangers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VERONIQUE de TURENNE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The largest herd of bighorn sheep in the Rancho Mirage desert
highlands may perch not above some rocky point but on the city's supply
of stationery, which features a stylized ram.</LD>
<LD>   Chosen by Rancho Mirage as its official symbol nearly three decades
ago, the bighorn's fortunes have faltered as the city's population
swelled.</LD>
<LD>   Struck by cars, drowned in swimming pools, poisoned by pesticides and
exotic plants, the animal's plight puts it on the federal endangered
species list. In an effort to save the remaining herd from further harm,
city officials are building a 3 1/2-mile, $1.2-million fence to separate
the sheep from civilization.</LD>
<TE>   "The one way to keep this from hurting the sheep, short of the federal
government coming in and telling us we can't develop . . . vacant land,
is to build a barrier that will take care of the problem," said Patrick
Pratt, Rancho Mirage's city manager.</TE>
<TE>   That barrier, an 8-foot-high mesh fence, will border the flatlands
along California 111 and scale the Santa Rosa Mountains' steep peaks. It
will measure about 3 1/2 miles as the crow flies, but about eight to 10
miles as the sheep scrambles. An initial stretch, built in 1999, proved
to be inadequate after the sheep learned they could skirt the barrier by
walking to its end.</TE>
<TE>   Work on the second phase, which reaches from the western city limits
to a flood-control channel in the east, began in December and is expected
to take about four months. The city is paying about $880,000 of the cost;
private donations total more than $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   A third phase will be built partly by a developer who is required to
erect the fence by an agreement with the city that provides building
rights in exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had letters to the editor in the local paper and comments
during City Council meetings questioning our commitment to this fence,"
Pratt said. "But that's the way of the world. Not everyone agrees on
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Local and federal wildlife experts do agree on the need to help the
region's sheep. About 1,200 bighorn roamed the Peninsular range, which
includes the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto mountains, in 1973 when Rancho
Mirage incorporated. By the mid-1990s, the number had plummeted to 276
before rebounding a bit to 400 sheep today.</TE>
<TE>   Two local herds--the Santa Rosa population, which numbers 45, and the
San Jacinto population, which includes 29, have continued to lose ground
as development has closed in on the foothills and mountains. Because ewes
produce just one lamb a year, the species' well-being depends on the
herds' success in rearing their young.</TE>
<TE>   "We began a lamb mortality study that showed us most of the deaths
were taking place in the urban areas," said Jim DeForge, founder and
director of the Bighorn Institute in Palm Desert. "It became clear that
we would have to separate the sheep from the developed areas if they were
to survive."</TE>
<TE>   Bighorn sheep became established in North America after crossing the
Bering land bridge from Eurasia during the late Pleistocene Epoch,
according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Sheep in the
Peninsular range roam from the San Jacinto Mountains near Palm Springs
and the Santa Rosas near Rancho Mirage to the Volcan Tres Virgenes
Mountains near Santa Rosalia, in Mexico's Baja California.</TE>
<TE>   They prefer altitudes ranging from 300 to 4,000 feet, where annual
rainfall seldom tops 4 inches and temperatures climb to 104 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, the California Fish and Game Commission listed the species as
"rare." In March 1998, the sheep were placed on the endangered species
list. By building the bighorn fence, biologists say, Rancho Mirage is
taking an important step in protecting them.</TE>
<TE>   "This fence will remove one of the greatest sources of mortality to
the sheep," said Kevin Brennan, a wildlife biologist with the state
Department of Fish and Game. "The lawns and landscaping of the city are
attractive to the sheep, but they also can be fatal."</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest lures--lush lawns--has been deadly. Sheep can
ingest a parasite in the grass that, if it doesn't kill them, can weaken
them so much that they become vulnerable to predators, Brennan said.
Simply wandering among buildings and shrubbery can make them an easy
target for the bobcats and mountain lions that hunt in the Santa Rosa
foothills.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists say the sheep, whose grazing keeps growth down and helps
spread native plants via seeds that get caught in their long coats, are
an integral part of the mountain ecosystem. Rancho Mirage officials
believe it is their duty to help save their city emblem.</TE>
<TE>   "We are lucky enough to have the funds to do this," Pratt said. "Our
city founders saw fit to make the bighorn a symbol of the city, and it
would seem odd for us to turn our backs on them."</TE>

<HD>Eileen Heckart, 82; Actress Won Oscar for 'Butterflies Are Free'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eileen Heckart, the Oscar-winning overprotective mother of Edward
Albert's blind character in love with kooky Goldie Hawn in "Butterflies
Are Free," and the twice Emmy-nominated Aunt Flo Meredith, the
globe-trotting international correspondent of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show"
and "Lou Grant," has died. She was 82.</LD>
<LD>   The gravel-voiced, consummate character actress, who earned a special
Tony in 2000 for her career excellence on stage, died Monday of cancer at
her home in Norwalk, Conn.</LD>
<LD>   Although Heckart described herself as "anything but eccentric," she
was usually cast as some sort of emotionally warped or distraught woman.
This was thanks to her tall, lanky frame, sad eyes and foghorn
voice--which she blamed more on childhood whooping cough than on her
chain smoking--not to mention her facile ability to portray any character
envisioned.</LD>
<TE>   "Just once," she told the now-defunct New York Journal American in
1958, "before I get too old, I'd like to play an attractive, normal,
uncomplicated woman."</TE>
<TE>   But whether she was inspiring young Mary or bedazzling Lou Grant, or
interfering in the lives of her film, television and stage children, it
was the odder roles that kept the actress working--and earning trophies
in any medium she tackled.</TE>
<TE>   Repeatedly nominated for nearly every acting award, Heckart received a
couple of Emmys, an Oscar, a Tony, as well as Outer Circle, New York
Drama Critics, Drama Desk, Lortel, Daniel Blum and Obie awards.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Columbus, Ohio, Anna Eileen Heckart was reared by her
grandparents after her parents divorced when she was 2. She worked her
way through Ohio State University, where she excelled in dramatics and
was urged to become an actress.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation in 1942, Heckart went to New York with $142 in her
pocket. She worked as a clerk in a department store, read radio
commercials and called time for badminton players at luxury hotels while
studying at the American Theatre Wing. She debuted the same year in a
Blackfriars Guild play.</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, she married her college sweetheart--John Harrison Yankee Jr.,
who died in 1995--settled in Connecticut and learned her craft in
understudy and touring stage roles. She found other opportunities in
drama with the invention of television, making her debut in 1947 in such
live-theater series as "Kraft Suspense Theater," "Studio One" and "The
Philco Television Playhouse."</TE>
<TE>   The 1950s became the seminal decade for Heckart. She flourished on
Broadway, prompting Hollywood to beckon, and managed to follow a couple
of significant roles from stage to screen.</TE>
<TE>   Heckart began to attract major notice in 1953 when she played Rosemary
Sidney, the love-starved schoolteacher in "Picnic."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, she created the role of the grief-stricken mother of a
murdered boy in "The Bad Seed," earning a Donaldson award. Although she
made her motion picture debut as Jane Wyman's friend in "Miracle in the
Rain" in 1956, Heckart followed a few months later with her re-creation
of Mrs. Daigle for the film version of "The Bad Seed."</TE>
<TE>   Before the decade ended, she was seen as Rocky Graziano's
misfortune-weary mother in "Somebody Up There Likes Me" and Marilyn
Monroe's waitress friend in "Bus Stop." Back on Broadway, she also earned
raves for her role as Aunt Lottie Lacey in William Inge's "The Dark at
the Top of the Stairs."</TE>
<TE>   Heckart first played the prickly mother in the Broadway version of
"Butterflies Are Free" in 1969 and then reprised the role for the 1972
film, earning an Academy Award for best supporting actress.</TE>
<TE>   Heckart was appearing as an Alzheimer's patient in "The Waverly
Gallery" in 2000 when she received her special Tony. Then 81, she decided
to withdraw from theater, commenting that at her age, "You don't have the
energy or the stamina you had when you were 60 or even 70."</TE>
<TE>   Among the memorable roles that seemed to glide easily from one form of
entertainment to another was Heckart's innovative 1976 portrayal of
former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, which a Times reviewer called "a
great intellectual pleasure." Heckart toured in a one-woman show,
"Eleanor," which played at Los Angeles' Ahmanson Theatre, depicting the
late-middle-aged activist as slightly sexy as well as brainy. The
interpretation earned Heckart the role as Eleanor in the critically
acclaimed 1979 television miniseries "Backstairs at the White House."</TE>
<TE>   Although based in the New York area, Heckart was a frequent visitor to
Los Angeles stages as well as sound stages. In 1995, she appeared as the
grandmother in "Pippin" at Long Beach Civic Light Opera at the special
invitation of its then-new artistic director--her son, Luke Yankee.</TE>
<TE>   Among the many plays in Heckart's long theater career were "Our Town,"
"They Knew What They Wanted," "A View From the Bridge," "Barefoot in the
Park," "You Know I Can't Hear You When the Water's Running," "Mother
Courage" (her favorite role), "Time of the Cuckoo," "The Effect of Gamma
Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds," "Love Letters" and "Driving Miss
Daisy."</TE>
<TE>   Her movies included: "Hot Spell," starring Shirley Booth and Anthony
Quinn; "Heller in Pink Tights," with Sophia Loren and Quinn; "Up the Down
Staircase," with Sandy Dennis; "No Way to Treat a Lady," with Rod
Steiger; "Zandy's Bride," starring Gene Hackman; "Heartbreak Ridge," with
Clint Eastwood; "Seize the Day," with Robin Williams; and "The First
Wives Club" (as Diane Keaton's mother).</TE>
<TE>   On television, in addition to "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," Heckart
joined the casts of such series as "Out of the Blue," "Trauma Center,"
"Partners in Crime," "The Five Mrs. Buchanans" and "Murder One." She also
made guest appearances in many series, including "Gunsmoke" and "The
Defenders," and in several television movies.</TE>
<TE>   Heckart is survived by her three sons, Mark, Philip and Luke Yankee.</TE>

<HD>Ralph Sutton, 79; Jazz Performer Known for 'Stride' Piano Styling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ralph Sutton, a master of the "stride" piano best known for his
longtime gig at Eddie Condon's jazz club in New York City in the late
1940s and early 1950s, has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Sutton died Saturday evening in his car outside a restaurant in
Evergreen, Colo., after dining with his wife and friends. The cause of
death was not immediately known. Sutton suffered a stroke in the early
1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Stride, a piano styling that grew out of ragtime, became popular in
America in the 1920s and '30s. It was characterized by a robust but
tastefully controlled technique, an impeccably precise sense of rhythm,
and an ebullient dancing quality. It was made popular by James P.
Johnson, Fats Waller and Willie "the Lion" Smith.</LD>
<TE>   The Missouri-born Sutton learned it as a boy after hearing Waller on
the radio. He was one of the founders of the World's Greatest Jazz Band
in 1968 and played regularly with the group, which also included Bob
Haggart and Yank Lawson, until the mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Sutton made his professional debut at age 11 in his father's band.
Studying to be an osteopath, Sutton switched direction in 1941, at 19,
and joined the band of the trombone great Jack Teagarden. But that job
was interrupted when Sutton was drafted into the Army during World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Sutton returned to play for Teagarden until the band
broke up. He worked in and around New York, and began making a name for
himself in 1947 on the weekly radio show "This Is Jazz." A year later, he
started working at Condon's club.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he made a number of fine recordings, working in the
duo format with players such as Jay McShann, Ruby Braff and Kenny Davern.</TE>
<TE>   Through the '80s and '90s, Sutton played jazz dates both nationally
and internationally and was a fixture at traditional jazz festivals.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Sunnie; three sons, Jeffrey, Peter and
Nick, all of Petaluma, Calif.; and seven grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Frankie Gaye, 60; Singer's War Letters Influenced Brother's Hit '71
Album</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frankie Gaye, 60, whose experiences during the Vietnam War
influenced his older brother Marvin's legendary Motown album "What's
Going On," died Friday in Los Angeles of complications after a heart
attack.</LD>
<LD>   Frankie Gaye was a radio operator stationed in Vietnam in the 1960s
when he wrote letters to his brother expressing his dissatisfaction with
the war, saying it was wrong and unjust and sickened him. His experiences
influenced several songs on his brother's 1971 album, including "Save the
Children," "Inner City Blues" and "Mercy Mercy Me," according to Ralph
Tee in the book "Soul Music Who's Who."</LD>
<LD>   Gaye, like his brother, had begun singing in church as a youngster. He
went on to work with several Motown artists, including Mary Wells and Kim
Weston, and provided background vocals on many of his brother's albums,
including "What's Going On" and 1977's "Marvin Gaye, Live at the London
Palladium."</LD>
<TE>   On his own, Frankie Gaye composed the soundtrack to the 1972 film
"Penitentiary 1" and toured extensively, both in the United States and
England. He also released the singles "Extraordinary Girl" in 1989 and
"My Brother" in 1990.</TE>

<HD>William X. Kienzle, 73; Ex-Priest, Author</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Xavier Kienzle, a literary Roman Catholic priest from
Detroit who ran his diocesan newspaper and other publications for 20
years and then turned in his collar and robes to write nearly two dozen
best-selling mystery novels, has died. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Kienzle, whose first book, "The Rosary Murders," was made into a 1987
film starring Donald Sutherland as his protagonist priest, died Friday of
a heart attack at his home in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills,
Mich.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Detroit, Kienzle once told The Times he made the unusual
change in professions so that he could share all the weird and funny
things that happened during his two decades as a Motown priest.</LD>
<TE>   Educated at Sacred Heart Seminary College and St. John's Seminary,
Kienzle demonstrated a flair for writing from the time of his 1954
ordination. During his work at five Detroit parishes before leaving the
priesthood in 1974, he contributed articles to the Minneapolis magazine
MPLS under the pseudonym Mark Boyle.</TE>
<TE>   More significant, from 1962 to 1974 he was editor in chief of the
archdiocese's newspaper, Michigan Catholic, earning a Michigan Knights of
Columbus award for general excellence in journalism and a Catholic Press
Assn. acknowledgment for editorial writing.</TE>
<TE>   Kienzle spent five years segueing from priesthood to novelist, moving
from MPLS to teaching contemplative studies at Western Michigan
University and then the University of Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1979, he published his first novel, patterning his kindly,
liberal hero priest and Catholic journalist of Detroit--Father Robert
Koesler--somewhat after himself.</TE>
<TE>   First novels rarely do so well. But, as a Times reviewer noted,
"heaven seems to have smiled" and Kienzle's "The Rosary Murders" landed
on the top-10 bestseller lists, was adopted by several book clubs, was
reprinted in paperback and was quickly picked up for the movie.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Rosary Murders," Koesler, portrayed by Sutherland, hears the
confession of a Detroit serial killer of priests and nuns and must
contend with his inability to tell police because of a canon law
promising confession-booth confidentiality. To tout the movie, the
Hollywood ads teased: "Bless me father, for I have killed."</TE>
<TE>   The plot established Kienzle's style, which a Times reviewer described
as "a curious mixture of violence, humor and religious commentary." The
writer applauded the first book as "ingenious, witty and literate."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Gorner wrote for the Chicago Tribune that it "quickly
established Father Koesler as among the most likable and authentic of all
recent sleuths, and gave his wise and compassionate creator [Kienzle] a
midlife career and a new pulpit. Few mystery series have been more cozy
and persuasive."</TE>
<TE>   Kienzle always insisted that his books were "first of all thrillers,"
but they did deal partly with theological controversies, and many critics
saw deeper meanings behind the whodunits. Gorner, for example, called
Kienzle's novels "more small morality plays than classic mysteries."</TE>
<TE>   The former priest's second book, published in 1980, was titled "Death
Wears a Red Hat" only after Kienzle's publisher rejected his somewhat
tongue-in-cheek suggestions of "I Had Intercourse with a Bear" or "I Had
Intercourse with a Bear for the FBI and Found God." Tangled in the plot
along with Detroit priests, cops and journalists were such subjects as
decapitations, extortion, prostitution, drug peddling, black magic and
abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Kienzle continued to successfully spin out the books at a rate of one
a year: "Mind over Murder," "Assault with Intent," "Shadow of Death,"
"Kill and Tell," "Sudden Death," "Deathbed," "Deadline for a Critic,"
"Marked for Murder," "Eminence," "Masquerade," "Chameleon," "Body Count,"
"Dead Wrong," "Bishop as Pawn," "Call No Man Father," "Requiem for
Moses," "The Man Who Loved God," "The Greatest Evil," "No Greater Love,"
"Till Death" and last year's "The Sacrifice."</TE>
<TE>   The priest-author Kienzle married Javan Herman Andrews in 1974, and
the priest-protagonist Koesler never hesitated to do something
controversial like walk an ex-nun down the aisle at her wedding.</TE>
<TE>   Kienzle's work was sometimes compared to other religious-ethnic
mystery series: one featuring the fictional Rabbi Small and written by
Harry Kemelman, and another following Father Brown as created and written
by G.K. Chesterton. But, far from accusing Kienzle of imitating those who
had gone before, critics said he merely proved that religion was full of
possibilities for the mystery genre.</TE>
<TE>   The author played with that concept in "Masquerade," rated by Times
reviewer Charles Champlin as "pleasant and tasteful reading." The plot
involves Koesler speaking at an ecumenical crime writers conference,
attended by a rabbi who writes about a sleuthing rabbi, and features a
despicable publisher as the murder victim.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to Kienzle's sixth novel, "Kill and Tell," another Times
reviewer wrote that "there seems to be a Koesler cult developing
reminiscent of the following for Agatha Christie's Miss Marple and G.K.
Chesterton's Father Brown."</TE>
<TE>   Kienzle is survived by his wife.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial Mass is scheduled at 1 p.m. Jan. 12 at St. Owen's Church in
Bloomfield Hills, Mich.</TE>

<HD>BCS Is Ducking for Cover</HD>
<DH>Fiesta Bowl: Oregon makes push for a share of national title with
impressive 38-16 victory over Colorado.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.
</DL>
<LD>The time for bitterness and angry words had passed. The Oregon
players did their loudest talking in another way.</LD>
<LD>   They did it with an explosive offense. They did it with unexpected
tenacity on defense.</LD>
<LD>   The second-ranked Ducks staked their claim to a share of the national
championship with a 38-16 victory over No. 3 Colorado in the Fiesta Bowl
on New Year's Day. So convincing was the performance that quarterback
Joey Harrington declined to make a closing statement.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't want to do it with words," he said. "I think we did it with
our play on the field."</TE>
<TE>   Now Harrington and his teammates await the Rose Bowl, the title game
that--through the quirks of the bowl championship series--snubbed them.</TE>
<TE>   If top-ranked Miami wins, finishing undefeated, consider the matter
settled. But if No. 4 Nebraska scores an upset, thereby taking the
controversial BCS championship, it is quite possible the Associated Press
poll will go the other way and crown Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   And it seems the Ducks will wait calmly, their victory before a crowd
of 74,118 cooling tempers that overflowed in recent weeks. After the
game, instead of cursing the BCS or comparing it to a dreaded disease,
players and coaches quietly argued for their share of the title.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado Coach Gary Barnett sounded convinced.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could vote," he said, "I would vote for them."</TE>
<TE>   Just about everyone in this game seemed startled by the way Oregon
(11-1) prevailed. The way Harrington seemed effortless in ripping the
secondary for 350 yards and four touchdowns. The way Colorado's usually
fearsome ground game was held to 49 yards, almost 180 yards below the
season average.</TE>
<TE>   "They just stopped the run," receiver Roman Hollowell said. "Stopped
our offense entirely."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado (10-3) had imitated its mascot, Ralphie the Buffalo, while
stampeding over Nebraska and Texas late in the season, but Oregon crowded
the line of scrimmage with extra tacklers. Initially, this in-your-face
strategy hardly fazed the Buffaloes, who marched down the field with a
trio of fast, strong tailbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Purify gained seven yards up the middle and Cortlen Johnson took
a screen pass 33 yards. Chris Brown took over from there, running for 18
yards on the next four plays. Finally, fullback Brandon Drumm bulled over
from the one-yard line to give his team a 7-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   It was a style of play that Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti had fretted
about all week. Still, his defense continued to pack the box, no player
more than six or seven yards deep, the cornerbacks in man coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop the run and they have to pass," said linebacker Wesly Mallard,
who led his team with 13 tackles. "That plays right into our hands."</TE>
<TE>   The game might have turned on two plays in the second quarter. Both
times, Oregon's defense stuffed Colorado on third and one. "It probably
took a little wind out of our sails and was pretty much indicative of the
night," Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   And while the Buffaloes struggled, Oregon was just heating up.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who won the Pacific 10 Conference title with a balanced and
inventive offense, particularly liked the matchup between their receivers
and the Colorado secondary. They announced as much on their first snap
when Harrington threw deep to receiver Samie Parker down the sideline.
The ball sailed long, but it was a rare miss.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington tied the score late in the first quarter by completing a
28-yard touchdown pass to Keenan Howry, who had sneaked past free safety
Robbie Robinson. A few minutes later, Parker outran the secondary and
caught a 79-yard bomb for a 14-7 lead that Oregon would never relinquish.</TE>
<TE>   With the run taken away, Colorado had no choice but to rely on
quarterback Bobby Pesavento. The senior completed 61% of his passes this
season but would finish only 11 for 27. When one of his passes floated
into the hands of Oregon cornerback Steve Smith, the Ducks took advantage
with another Smith--tailback Onterrio--who carried a shovel pass six
yards for a 21-7 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   All season long, Oregon had been criticized for appearing to cruise,
letting opponents stay close. The Ducks needed comebacks in several games
against weaker teams and, against Stanford at midseason, squandered a
fourth-quarter lead in a loss that ultimately cost them a trip to
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   This time, they seemed intent on making a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the second-half kickoff, they drove 88 yards for a 28-7 lead.
Tailback Maurice Morris darted down the sideline, broke one tackle, sat
down on a fallen defender, then sprang up without touching the ground and
finished a 49-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   The closest Colorado came to making a game of it was a few minutes
later when an apparent score was nullified, an official ruling that
Pesavento had stepped over the line of scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   The Buffaloes then missed a field-goal attempt, Steve Smith collected
two more interceptions for a total of three and Harrington threw another
pass into the end zone. The best Colorado could manage was a last-minute
touchdown to make the score a little more respectable.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon fans had already risen to their feet by that point, chanting
"We're No. 1." Their cry will echo through college football over the next
two days as everyone plays a game of wait-and-see.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be sitting in front of the television set," tailback Morris
said, looking forward to the Rose Bowl. "Hopefully Nebraska will do us a
favor."</TE>

<HD>Sheffield Claims Dodgers, Evans Have Misled Him</HD>
<DH>Baseball: All-star outfielder says he wants a trade or assurances
he'll remain with team until his contract is up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beginning another year on bad terms with the Dodgers, Gary
Sheffield said Tuesday he has been misled by General Manager Dan Evans
and that he wants to be traded before spring training or assured that he
will be with the club until his contract expires after the 2004 season.</LD>
<LD>   The all-star left fielder said he is frustrated because Evans recently
told him that he did not try to trade him to the Oakland Athletics,
dismissing reports about a proposed deal that would have brought
outfielder Jermaine Dye and closer Billy Koch to Los Angeles. Evans
acknowledged he spoke with Sheffield recently but declined comment on
Sheffield's interpretation of the conversation.</LD>
<LD>   Sheffield, who first blasted team officials while trying to force a
trade last February, said he does not trust the Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   "When somebody tells you something and then they hang up the phone and
you know it's not the truth, it's one of those things where you wonder to
yourself what you have to do to get the truth," said Sheffield,
vacationing at his off-season home in Tampa, Fla. "You try to be a man
about it and make phone calls to the organization, just to get a direct
answer, and you basically don't get a straightforward answer.</TE>
<TE>   "It becomes frustrating to the point where you ask yourself, 'Do I
really want to be with this organization?' I don't want to be with an
organization that constantly tells me one thing and then does another.
I'm not going to sugarcoat that one bit. I deserve enough respect not to
be told things like that."</TE>
<TE>   Evans said he would not engage in public debates with players.</TE>
<TE>   "I spoke with [Sheffield] for the first time this off-season the other
night, and I won't discuss the content of that conversation," Evans said.
"My experience with Gary has been very positive in the short time that
I've been with the ballclub.</TE>
<TE>   "I just won't discuss my plans regarding Gary Sheffield or any other
player in the media. And one thing I will never do [is] discuss any
contractual matters publicly. I just don't believe that's the way I ever
want to do business. And I'm not going to start now."</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield will have salaries of $9.5 million in 2002 and $11 million
in 2003. The club holds an $11-million option in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman Bob Daly's refusal to give Sheffield a "lifetime contract"
last spring triggered the ongoing feud between Sheffield and the Dodgers.
However, Sheffield said he is only seeking peace of mind now.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not demanding anything, but it's going to have to be either-or,"
he said. "It's not going to keep being, 'Gary, we're not trying to trade
you,' but then behind closed doors they are trying to trade me. Then when
I come to spring training they say to me, 'OK, Gary, now go out and hit
40 home runs for us and take us to a championship.' When I look at all of
that, I have to say to myself that enough is enough.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that [the Dodgers] can't tell me anything now.
You've got to show actions. It's not about them telling me I've got a
title on this team, that I'm the franchise player. Until they say, 'OK,
Gary, this is what the case is, this is what we're going to do to prove
what we're saying about you,' I don't want to hear anything. Or, they can
take the other course and trade me. Either way I'm all for it, but it's
all about actions now."</TE>
<TE>   Although Evans also previously told reporters he is not trying to
trade Sheffield, executives from other teams paint a different picture.</TE>
<TE>   They said Evans initiated talks with Oakland and the Toronto Blue Jays
about a proposed three-team trade because Koch, formerly of the Blue
Jays, was the top player on the Dodgers' off-season wish list. Evans then
focused on trading Sheffield to the Athletics after Oakland General
Manager Billy Beane acquired Koch.</TE>
<TE>   Beane had planned to accept the Dodgers' offer of Sheffield and
pitchers Luke Prokopec and Mike Trombley for Dye and Koch, sources said,
but declined when Evans also insisted on getting one of the Athletics'
pitching prospects in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   On the last day of the baseball winter meetings in Boston three weeks
ago, Evans traded Prokopec and minor league pitcher Chad Ricketts to the
Blue Jays for reliever Paul Quantrill and minor league middle infielder
Cesar Izturis. Evans then tried to modify the Dodgers' offer to Oakland
to include prospects instead of Prokopec.</TE>
<TE>   Although acquiring Sheffield was the key to the deal for Oakland,
Prokopec also was a priority because Beane wanted to include him in other
proposed trades, baseball executives said. With Prokopec unavailable,
Beane's interest waned.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball sources said Evans also had unsuccessful discussions with the
St. Louis Cardinals, New York Yankees and New York Mets and Angels
regarding Sheffield.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Sheffield and the Dodgers are in another uncomfortable situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to come into spring training having to answer the same
questions every year," Sheffield said. "When I go to spring training my
focus is on winning a championship. When you have to answer questions
that you're really not comfortable in answering, that you don't even want
to think about, it's a distraction not only to me but also to the team.
It's putting yourself in a bad situation and also putting your teammates
in a bad situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes people don't know what to believe when [the Dodgers] are
saying something and I'm saying something. That's why it's just best that
everyone resolves the issues now because we're going to be back in the
same place that we were last year. We [Sheffield and agent Scott Boras]
just thought it would play itself out and work out for both sides, but it
seems like now they're dragging it along again and trying squeeze out
another year. There's going to have to be some type of halt to this by
spring training."</TE>
<TE>   Boras became Sheffield's agent in March and mediated the conflict
between his client and the Dodgers. Sheffield maintained an even demeanor
throughout the season, but his new comments may indicate new damage to
his relationship with the team.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago, and correctly so I may add, Bob Daly said to me that he
wasn't trying to trade Gary," Boras said. "Gary got information from
outside sources that said he was, and we all grew to learn that was
incorrect. Now, this year, the information is ... it's fairly obvious
that the Dodgers were trying to trade Gary."</TE>
<TE>   And how will Sheffield react if the Dodgers keep him without an
assurance about his future in Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   "I can't predict anything," Sheffield said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want anybody playing with my feelings and my emotions ... I
have to take it all in and just get ready for spring training wherever
that may be."</TE>

<HD>Ailing Clippers Go Extra Miles</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Their 20-year-old has 17 points as L.A. ends
three-game skid with 112-97 win over Portland. Odom and Olowokandi sit
out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Racing down the court with the game still very much in doubt in the
fourth quarter Tuesday, Quentin Richardson spotted a streaking Darius
Miles on the opposite wing. Richardson never broke stride, arching a lob
pass Miles' way.</LD>
<LD>   Miles launched himself after the ball, catching it and tossing it
through the hoop in one spectacular motion--more of a soft dunk than a
slam dunk.</LD>
<LD>   But those two points propelled the Clippers to a 112-97 victory over
Portland, ending their three-game losing streak and extending the Trail
Blazers' skid to five in a row before an often raucous sellout crowd of
18,964 at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Trailing the play, Elton Brand marveled at the pass and the dunk,
which gave the Clippers a 106-95 lead with 3:22 remaining in the game.
The Clippers would outscore the Trail Blazers, 6-2, the rest of the way,
making it look easier than it was.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it went out of Staples," Brand joked later. "Darius brought
it back to earth. I was thinking as I was running down court to rebound,
'Oh, that's out of bounds.' But that shows his athleticism right there.
He brought it back down."</TE>
<TE>   It would be one thing if that highlight-reel dunk was all the
20-year-old Miles gave the Clippers, but there was so much more. Miles
made long-range jump shots, hooks from the low block and dunks. He made
eight of 11 shots en route to 17 points in 29 minutes. And by no means
was Miles' skywalking the only memorable moment for the Clippers. Seven
Clippers scored in double figures--led by 23 from point guard Jeff
McInnis and 19 from Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   By game's end, it was difficult to comprehend how much this game meant
to the Clippers. They had lost three in a row going into the game and
face not one, but two grueling stretches of four games in five nights in
the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also were without starting center Michael Olowokandi, who
came down with food poisoning, and versatile swingman Lamar Odom, who sat
out his third game because of a badly sprained right wrist.</TE>
<TE>   So any play that clicked like Richardson to Miles was bound to give
the Clippers a jolt of adrenaline.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a real important win for us," Coach Alvin Gentry
said. "To step up like we did was great, especially missing two starters.
Darius was sensational all night. If he can shoot it like that, he
becomes almost impossible to guard."</TE>
<TE>   If Miles continues to shoot well from the perimeter, opponents will be
forced to guard him more closely, which will open up space for post
players such as Brand and Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the Clippers welcomed back shooting guard Eric Piatkowski
to the starting lineup after he battled a nagging strained right hip
flexor for all of last month. Piatkowski had 10 points in 25 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't look at a stat sheet and see what 'Pike' does for us,"
Gentry said of Piatkowski. "He creates space right away when he's on the
floor, so having him out there is great."</TE>
<TE>   Brand faced solo coverage Tuesday, primarily from Rasheed Wallace, a
departure from recent games without Piatkowski. Freed from persistent
double-teaming, Brand scored 16 points and took eight rebounds against
Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Exploiting the opposition's weaknesses hasn't always been a Clipper
strength this season, but they took advantage of all the Trail Blazers
had to give Tuesday. The Clippers didn't appear to be troubled by their
three-game losing streak, which included a dispiriting overtime loss
Sunday against the Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers attacked Portland from the key and from the perimeter,
spinning the Trail Blazers around and around. When Portland got close
late, after trailing by as many as 18 points early in the third quarter,
the Clippers played as if they were without a care in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to win just for our confidence," Piatkowski said. "We had
lost some games we should have won. I didn't know what to expect playing
on New Year's Day. But we played a solid all-around game. We had seven
guys in double figures. Maybe we're growing up."</TE>
<TE>   The next step in the Clippers' maturing process is showing the same
grace under pressure on the road. They play eight of their next nine away
from Staples Center, starting tonight against the Kings at Sacramento.
They are 1-7 on the road.</TE>

<KH>ROSE BOWL / MIAMI vs. NEBRASKA, Thursday, 5 p.m., Channel 7</KH>
<HD>Now They're Miami Nice</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: "How are you going to stop Eric Crouch?"</LD>
<LD>   Philip Buchanon Answer: "I don't know. It's gonna be kind of hard."</LD>
<LD>   What? You don't ... \o7 know?\f7  Kind of ... \o7 hard?\f7</LD>
<TE>   This is not the response we expected earlier this week from a star
cornerback on a University of Miami team preparing to play for a national
championship against Crouch's Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   This is so disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, asking that question of a Miami player would be like
putting a pipe in front of Howard Schnellenberger.</TE>
<TE>   Hold your nose and wait for the smoke.</TE>
<TE>   How are you going to stop Eric Crouch?</TE>
<TE>   Ray Lewis would have said, "Eric who?"</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Erickson would have said, "I don't know, offer my guys $500 to
take his head off?"</TE>
<TE>   Warren Sapp would have said, "Dude, when I get rid of these munchies,
I'm gonna clip the little roach."</TE>
<TE>   This is so depressing.</TE>
<TE>   These top-ranked, unbeaten Hurricanes have been here for seven days
now and not once have they swaggered, stalked, stolen, spiked, scammed or
stripped.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Southern California parties and--can this be right?--not one
hosted by a municipal court judge.</TE>
<TE>   "This a different decade, different personalities, different people,"
said Buchanon.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, yeah, yeah, we heard all that. We just didn't believe it.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly two decades, dirty laundry fit Miami the way white socks
fit Joe Paterno.</TE>
<TE>   Their craziness became our comfort.</TE>
<TE>   It gave us a platform from which to dive into the myriad problems of
college athletics.</TE>
<TE>   It gave us an example of all that is wrong with a society that coddles
its youth.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so it gave us three good columns a year.</TE>
<TE>   And now?</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes have become the Sugar Canes.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Irvin help us.</TE>
<TE>   Question: What do you think about the Rose Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   Clinton Portis Answer: "It's been wonderful. Everybody here has been
wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   For shame.</TE>
<TE>   And he calls himself a Miami running back?</TE>
<TE>   Jerome Brown would have said, "Lemme get this flak jacket buttoned,
then I'll tell you."</TE>
<TE>   Lamar Thomas would have said, "Lemme tear off my helmet and do the
Charleston, then I'll tell you."</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Johnson would have said, "Me, me, me, me, me."</TE>
<TE>   While espousing the advantages of improved character and renewed
integrity, these new Hurricanes acknowledged that their behavior
modification was inspired by something less complex.</TE>
<TE>   "We changed because we didn't have no choice," said receiver Daryl
Jones.</TE>
<TE>   One hand was tied behind their backs by the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   After all, in a 14-scene NCAA video sent to every team illustrating
outlawed plays and behavior, the first nine scenes featured Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so bad, I remember in high school in Dallas, an official came
to our locker room and talked to us about too much celebrating, called
it, 'The Miami Rule,"' remembered Jones, a senior from Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   He smiled wistfully.</TE>
<TE>   "Clowning around, taking off our helmets, doing flips ... if we could
do it, we'd do it," he said. "But we can't."</TE>
<TE>   The other hand was tied by the coaching staff.</TE>
<TE>   When Butch Davis took over from Dennis Erickson in 1995--sometime
after Erickson "misplaced" Warren Sapp's positive drug test in a desk
drawer--the rules were changed.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the team was on probation, the new players could not be.</TE>
<TE>   Considering one in seven players off the 1994 squad had been arrested,
the remodel was slow. But for once, things were steady.</TE>
<TE>   "Butch came in and recruited only athletes with character," admitted
Coach Larry Coker, a former Davis assistant. "He wanted kids who would go
to class, who would behave themselves, good kids."</TE>
<TE>   The team suffered at first but, then, well, remember their last game
of 1998?</TE>
<TE>   Nobody in these parts can forget. The Hurricanes not only whipped the
potential national champion UCLA, 49-45, but did so without a taunt.</TE>
<TE>   The Randal Hill swagger had been replaced by the Edgerrin James
pummel.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first clear sign that Miami could win without the vice.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Coker is fighting tooth-and-swerve to make it a tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "Every week, I show him a new dance, tell him, 'Look what I got if I
score!"' Portis explained. "But every week, he goes, 'Nahhhhhh."'</TE>
<TE>   What the coach doesn't enforce, the biggest bullies on the team do.</TE>
<TE>   If you can slip something past Coker, you won't get it past the
celebrated offensive line.</TE>
<TE>   More impressive than giving up only four sacks, they allowed no public
embarrassments.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still times we have guys standing up in the room saying we
need to do this or that," explained center Brett Romberg. "We tell them,
sit down, it's not like that anymore. There's no need for late hits.
There's no need to talk junk. Nobody can hear you talking junk on TV, can
they?"</TE>
<TE>   And when the linemen feel that a player is acting too big for his hip
pads?</TE>
<TE>   Ask sophomore lineman Vern Carey.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season he was jumped in the locker room and slapped
around with, um, sandals.</TE>
<TE>   "Big Vern wasn't so big anymore," Romberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Their best offensive lineman, senior tackle Bryant McKinnie, is the
football version of Shane Battier--the best basketball player in the
country who decided to stay in school through his senior season.</TE>
<TE>   Their other celebrated lineman, senior tackle Joaquin Gonzalez, turned
down a scholarship at Harvard to walk on at his favorite school.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes have five starters in graduate school.</TE>
<TE>   Every senior is on schedule to graduate.</TE>
<TE>   What in the name of Luther Campbell is this world coming to?</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, hearing some of these stories makes you want to be back in the
day ... the football dorms, getting paid to play," Romberg said. "But
this is about something different."</TE>
<TE>   Something quietly dignified and honorable.</TE>
<TE>   Something deafening.</TE>

<LD>It's obvious the Oregon Ducks have been cheated. They were
stronger, quicker, faster, more passionate, more physical, more clever,
better coached and better prepared than Colorado. And it took about two
minutes of watching Tuesday's Fiesta Bowl to realize that. Their 38-16
win confirmed it.</LD>
<LD>   But the Ducks aren't the only people who will feel a bit sick in the
stomach Thursday when Miami plays Nebraska for the "national
championship." National championship of what? Of wishful thinking? Of
short-circuited computers? Of middle-aged, blazer-wearing men so eager to
protect their "BCS" that all common sense is abandoned for a "formula"
that will probably change again next season if Nebraska beats Miami?</LD>
<LD>   The Rose Bowl has been cheated.</LD>
<TE>   It deserved, in its turn as host of the "national championship" game,
to have the two best teams playing. It doesn't. Should Nebraska upset
Miami, it will only prove that Oregon would have beaten Miami even worse.</TE>
<TE>   And the Rose Bowl could have kept a small piece of a lovely tradition
if Oregon had been invited, as it should have been, to the Granddaddy of
Them All. At least one-half of the tradition would have endured. Which
was good enough this year. Let the Big Ten fend for itself.</TE>
<TE>   Also cheated: the Pac-10. How did it become conventional wisdom that
the Big 12 was so super? Why did anyone think Nebraska did something
impressive by beating Oklahoma? Oklahoma barely beat a mediocre Arkansas
team Tuesday. Where does it compute that Oregon's one bad quarter, the
fourth against Stanford, is so much worse than Nebraska's one horrible
game against Colorado?</TE>
<TE>   As Oregon beat up Colorado, beat up the Buffaloes physically and
mentally, as Duck receivers ran by Colorado defenders, as the Oregon line
protected quarterback Joey Harrington when it needed to, then opened up
gigantic holes for the tailbacks, as Coach Mike Bellotti made inspired
play calls, it became time to wonder what all the "experts" had been
watching all season.</TE>
<TE>   Cheated, too, are West Coast football fans who deserved to be bragging
about the Ducks, who should be preparing for a big day Thursday, watching
kids from Oregon, of course, but also California, Arizona, Nevada and
Washington. Southern California fans have been especially cheated. Of the
91 Oregon players listed on the Fiesta Bowl flip card, 32 were from
Southern California. Those 32, their families, their high school coaches,
their girlfriends and grade-school buddies, should have been cramming the
Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Television has been cheated.</TE>
<TE>   Duck tailback Onterrio Smith said that he would love to play Miami.
"Our speed versus their speed," Smith said. "Our offense versus their
defense; our defense versus their offense; West Coast speed versus East
Coast speed. What a game that would be. Honestly, I think we match up
better against Miami than Nebraska does. I know people will say I'm
biased. But don't you think I'm right?"</TE>
<TE>   Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, though, it is the Oregon players who have been cheated.</TE>
<TE>   As Bellotti said, "It's difficult to tell my kids why we aren't
playing in the Rose Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   How does Bellotti explain how any computer believes Nebraska is better
than Oregon?</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Samie Parker smiled and said, "I can't figure out those
computers unless there's a Y2K bug. There must be a big Y2K bug in there
somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Ducks were graceful in saying they were just happy to have
showcased their talents, that they had beaten Colorado so emphatically,
that they had forced the football-watching part of the country to at
least notice the same team that humiliated Nebraska, 62-36, had been
manhandled by Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not anything more we can do," wide receiver Keenan Howry
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a reason we are where we are. We lost a game to Stanford.
Once we lost that game, at that moment we couldn't handle our own fate
anymore. So it will not hurt me to watch the Rose Bowl on Thursday. I'll
sit and I'll root for Nebraska. I guess the only question I've got that
no one can answer is how the computer had us ranked behind Colorado. They
did have two losses."</TE>
<TE>   It would be nice to ask the computer to explain that. The computer
took into account, apparently, that Oregon played a lot of close games
but didn't take into account that Nebraska got waxed in its most
important.</TE>
<TE>   Blame the programming geeks for that.</TE>
<TE>   But how to explain why so many media experts made Colorado the
"hottest team" in the country on the basis of its walloping of Nebraska
and its 39-37 win over Texas in the Big 12 championship game? In its last
four games, the Colorado defense had given up 124 points. Yet the
Buffaloes were being spoken of as the best team in the country. Nobody
said that about Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a statement today," Harrington said. "We scored 38 unanswered
points and shot down the hottest team in the country. We showed that we
deserve to be playing for a share of the national championship."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't agree with the BCS," Smith said, "but so be it. Those are
the rules. I wish the computer had showed us a little bit of love. But it
didn't. So be it."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks left Sun Devils Stadium wearing championship T-shirts,
crying happy tears and smiling happy smiles. If they are bitter, they
aren't letting us see. And most of all, that makes them champions.</TE>

<DH>Future of Aging Rose Bowl Stadium Dependent on Attracting New
Business</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rose Bowl stadium is a national historic landmark, an
80-year-old structure that boasts a rich and colorful past.</LD>
<LD>   It also is a stadium with a future, though it remains to be seen
whether it will be as rosy as its name or as rocky as the nearby San
Gabriel Mountains that rise above it.</LD>
<LD>   "If we sit on our laurels, we're asking for it," said Darryl Dunn,
general manager of the Rose Bowl. "We need to find ways to invest in the
facility. If we can continue to do that, I believe it will continue to be
vibrant and one of the premier stadiums in the country."</LD>
<TE>   Maintaining both a stadium that can accommodate more than 106,000 and
a golf course that helps sustain it, keeping longtime tenant UCLA, and
attracting new tenants and events are the main challenges facing the Rose
Bowl, which anchors the scenic Arroyo Seco.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if a new 50,000-to 60,000-seat stadium were to be built in
Southern California, everything could change.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as you build a brand-spanking new stadium in the Los Angeles
area that has all the bells and whistles, the Rose Bowl will immediately
feel much more outdated," said Rick Burton, executive director of the
Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   That threat, for the time being, appears to be remote. The NFL
bypassed stadium proposals in Carson and at Hollywood Park in October
1999 and awarded an expansion franchise to Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Pasadena has invested $32 million over the last 10 years in
improvements at the Rose Bowl, Dunn said, and profits from the Brookside
Golf Course service a bond debt that stands at about $2.5 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl Operating Co., a nonprofit organization that operates
the stadium and golf course, had a net profit of $1.3 million in the last
fiscal year that ended June 30, Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, there were 22 events at the Rose Bowl, including five UCLA
football games, 15 Los Angeles Galaxy games, a U.S.-Brazil soccer game
and one concert by *NSYNC. This year, there will be closer to 30 events
as six international Gold Cup soccer games will be added to the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The annual Rose Bowl game remains the facility's star attraction.
Traditionally a matchup between teams from the Pacific 10 and Big Ten
conferences, the game's profile will be even higher on Thursday when
Miami plays Nebraska in the bowl championship series national
championship game.</TE>
<TE>   A flea market run by R.G. Canning Attractions has the second-longest
tenure at the Rose Bowl. The monthly event is beginning its 32nd year at
the stadium and parking lot. It draws about 15,000 on the second Sunday
of each month and generates $800,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tremendous winner for us, a staple," Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's football program has called the Rose Bowl home since leaving
the Coliseum after the 1981 season. Bruin fans enjoy the ambience of the
Arroyo Seco, and improvements in seating, restrooms and concessions over
the years have helped temper the disadvantage of being 25 miles from the
Westwood campus.</TE>
<TE>   Average attendance for seven Bruin home games was 67,280 in 2000 and
66,613 for five home games this past season, according to UCLA spokesman
Marc Dellins.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's current contract with the Rose Bowl ends after the 2003 season.
Signing UCLA into a long-term contract is one of Dunn's top priorities,
though negotiations with the school are not likely to begin until a
replacement is named for outgoing athletic director Pete Dalis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty clear that you have to have UCLA there long term," said
David Carter, president of the Sports Business Group, a consulting firm
that specializes in strategic marketing for the sports industry and is
working with the Rose Bowl on a business plan.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl will lose the Galaxy, a tenant since 1996, after the
2002 Major League Soccer season when the team moves to a $34-million,
20,000-seat soccer specific stadium under construction in Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn, however, said the loss of the Galaxy, which drew an average per
game of 17,387, last season, can be offset by more international soccer
matches at the Rose Bowl, which hosted the Women's World Cup in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Later this month, for example, the Rose Bowl will co-host with Miami
the 12-nation Gold Cup. The United States and Mexico are among the teams
that will compete at the Rose Bowl. The six scheduled matches in Pasadena
are expected to draw more than 200,000 over a two-week period, Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   Wango Tango, a one-day concert sponsored by radio station KIIS-FM, has
been booked for June and is the only music event currently on the Rose
Bowl schedule. The event is still waiting for approval by the Pasadena
City Council.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to find ways to bring more events into the facility," Dunn
said. "The question is, 'What's out there?' In a stadium this size,
what's big enough to fit here?"</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl has 46 suites but it's unlikely that it would be
considered a permanent home for an NFL team. It could, however, be used
as a temporary facility if the league puts a team in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl has played host to five Super Bowls, most recently the
1993 game between Dallas and Buffalo. In October, the Rose Bowl was
regarded as the No. 1 alternative site for this season's Super Bowl
before the NFL and the National Automobile Dealers Assn. reached an
agreement to switch convention dates in New Orleans. The conflict arose
because the NFL postponed Week 2 games in the aftermath of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Steeg, the NFL's senior vice president for special events, said
league policy currently prevents a Super Bowl from being awarded to a
city with no NFL team.</TE>
<TE>   "But who knows?" Steeg said. "All these things change. The city and
the police department in Pasadena have always been good friends to the
NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Other than making sure Thursday's game goes off smoothly, Dunn said
the Rose Bowl's most immediate order of business is a meeting next month
with the Pasadena City Council. At that time, the Rose Bowl Operating Co.
will present a three-year strategic plan that charts the future and
direction of the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Later this year, Dunn hopes to gain final approval for a use plan that
was approved in concept by the council in August 2000. The plan increases
from 12 to 25 the number of events with a minimum attendance of 20,000
that can be held at the Rose Bowl. That plan, however, cannot be voted on
until an environmental impact report for the entire Arroyo is completed
in April or May.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as a new stadium is not built in Southern California, we're
going to be OK," Dunn said. "We have a challenges in front if us even if
a new stadium is not built, but with some planning and foresight we
should be able to meet them."</TE>

<LD>   Author: Herschel Nissenson</LD>
<LD>   Publisher: Sports Publishing L.L.C.</LD>
<TE>   Price: $19.95</TE>
<TE>   This 230-page book is a compilation of brief personal stories from
Herschel Nissenson, former Associated Press national college football
editor and ESPN "College GameDay" researcher, who now writes for College
and Pro Football Weekly.</TE>
<TE>   The book is softcover, and the material is soft. That's not to say
some of Nissenson's anecdotes aren't entertaining. An example: "One year,
Bear Bryant filed a lawsuit against the NCAA's attempt to cut coaching
staffs. Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer was asked to predict the outcome.
'Let me get this straight,' he said. 'Bear Bryant is suing the NCAA in an
Alabama court where the judge is a graduate of the Alabama law school.
Don't ask me who is going to win or lose, just give me the point
spread."'</TE>
<TE>   The book came out earlier this year and apparently spawned similar
ones with short, random items about college football. There's "Tales of
the Tennessee Vols," "Tales From the Gator Swamp" and "Tales From the
Nebraska Sidelines."</TE>
<TE>   The Nebraska book, a recent release, was written by Don "Fox" Bryant,
former longtime Cornhusker sports information director. As one might
expect, there's nothing about Lawrence Phillips and any other Cornhuskers
who have embarrassed the program. What you get is plenty about legendary
coaches Bob Devaney and Tom Osborne. And lots about some of the great
Cornhusker players. This is a book Nebraska fans will enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   These books about college football can be purchased at local
bookstores or by calling (877) 424-2665 or through the Internet at
http://www.SportsPublishingLLC.com or http://www.Amazon.com.</TE>

<LD> Glenn Dickey of the San Francisco Chronicle writes that Tyrone
Willingham is making a huge career mistake by taking the Notre Dame
coaching job because "he will be exposed for the mediocre coach he is.</LD>
<LD>   "Willingham has gotten an inflated reputation at Stanford, largely
because the nearest comparison is Cal, which except for one year of Steve
Mariucci, has had seriously incompetent head coaches....</LD>
<LD>   "Overall, Willingham is not in the top tier of Stanford coaches in the
past half century. Indeed, his seven Big Game victories are virtually all
that separate him from a .500 record."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Willingham: Skip Bayless in the San Jose Mercury News: "A dream
opportunity has fallen to Willingham under nightmarish circumstances. He
wound up being the school's eighth or ninth choice, and on personality,
record and lack of Notre Dame ties, he'll be almost as tough a sell on
campus as a USC jersey."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What was unusual about USC's Rose Bowl games in 1933,
against Pittsburgh; 1939, Duke; 1967, Purdue and 1989, Michigan?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Way out: Gwen Knapp of the San Francisco Chronicle has a prediction
for April: "With the help of a stiff wind, pitching talent diluted by
expansion and 20 extra pounds of muscle, Sammy Sosa hits 23 home runs in
the first week of the baseball season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Is all forgiven? Paola Boivin in the Arizona Republic: "Look for David
Wells' second marriage to the Yankees to be a rocky one.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the same Wells who called owner George Steinbrenner a 'sneaky
scumbag' on ESPN Radio and told reporters 'Joe Torre isn't much of a
manager' and that Yankee players 'could have managed themselves to the
championship' without him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Different look: Utah basketball Coach Rick Majerus: "Lute Olson looks
like a coach. John Thompson looks like a coach. Pat Riley looks like a
coach. I'm just the guy in the L Reebok sweater who likes Italian food."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: They were played on Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Learn from an old foe: Even though Dallas beat San Francisco on
Sunday, Randy Galloway of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram says the 5-10
Cowboys could learn from the 11-4 49ers:</TE>
<TE>   "Over the past 15 or so NFL seasons, no two franchises have played off
each other, and also mirrored each other in good and bad times, like the
Cowboys and 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   "So now, as the Cowboys struggle to recover from self-induced
destruction known as salary-cap hell, what better example than the
once-hated San Frans. Hey, these guys are back from the football dead."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Come again? Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle, looking
forward to some big sports stories in 2002:</TE>
<TE>   "Dennis Miller quits Monday Night Football to join President Bush's
speech-writing team. In a progress report on the war on terrorism, Bush
tells the nation: 'That Bin Laden cat is harder to track down than
Sasquatch after he's had a Jason Giambi make over."'</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All donations accepted: The Green Bay Packers are $14,000
richer--thanks to some enterprising fans and a 9-inch stuffed rat dressed
in green and gold.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Henning of Oshkosh and Randy Franklin of Anchorage, Alaska,
recently donated the money to the Packers from the sales of the Lambeau
Field Pack Rat.</TE>
<TE>   The donation went to the team's capital improvement fund to maintain
and improve Lambeau Field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bob Harig on ESPN.com: "The official PGA Tour schedule
begins Thursday in Hawaii with the Mercedes Championships, a winners-only
event that will offer Tiger Woods his first opportunity of the new year
to capture his 30th win.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's one New Year's resolution: Let's not call it a 'slump' if he
fails to win....Unless Woods starts missing cuts--he's missed none since
1998--or doesn't contend on Sundays, or fails to win a single tournament
all year, it is no slump."</TE>

<HD>Bolstering Offense May Have to Wait</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The problem is easy to understand. The Mighty Ducks don't score
enough goals.</LD>
<LD>   Solving the problem, that's the trick and may well have to wait until
next summer.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks have been solid on defense and their goalies have been
exceptional in the last month. But they have scored 90 goals this season.
Only four teams have scored fewer.</LD>
<TE>   "We have identified that," Coach Bryan Murray said. "[General Manager]
Pierre [Gauthier] and I have talked about that regularly. They are very
difficult to come by at this point."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have gone the trade route this season, picking up Sergei
Krivokrasov and Patric Kjellberg to play on the third line.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are barren offensively, yet Krivokrasov has been a healthy
scratch for eight games, which may say something about his overall game.
Kjellberg skates on the first line, but has three goals and six points in
29 games with the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   The summer, when some teams find solutions, would seem the best bet.
Gauthier is on the hot seat to turn the franchise around. That may depend
on whether he is willing, or allowed, to spend money, and then spend it
wisely.</TE>
<TE>   German Titov was suppose to provide offense when he was given a
three-year, $4.6-million contract before last season. He has 13 goals and
28 points in 101 games as a Duck.</TE>
<TE>   The need for offense is vital.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we looking for another goal scorer? Of course," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   The search within has pretty much been exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   * Draft picks Timo Parssinen and Jonas Ronnqvist were pitched as
Europe-to-the-NHL possibilities. Both are buried at minor Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   * Free agent Andy McDonald has shown promise, but is just a rookie.</TE>
<TE>   * Marty McInnis, given a three-year contract last season, can be found
on the third line, goal-less in the last 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   * Steve Rucchin is enduring another season watching games after ankle
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Even Paul Kariya, their flagship scorer, has struggled. He is on pace
for a 58-point season in the first full season without Teemu Selanne
since 1995-96.</TE>
<TE>   "As a coach, I'm always saying, 'If we can get just one more guy,"'
Murray said. "I'll be saying that after we get one more guy.</TE>
<TE>   "We have played hard and very disciplined and looked after the
defensive zone for the most part. That's the first stages of getting the
franchise and the team turned around a little bit. The next step is
obviously to score some goals and win some games on a more consistent
basis."</TE>

<LD>Ziggy Palffy and Mathieu Schneider will return to the Kings' lineup
tonight against the Florida Panthers at Staples Center, Coach Andy Murray
said Tuesday, putting the Kings back at full strength for the first time
since early November.</LD>
<LD>   Palffy, the Kings' leading scorer last season, has not played since
suffering a broken rib below his collarbone while crashing awkwardly into
the boards in a Dec. 1 game against the Nashville Predators.</LD>
<LD>   Schneider, sidelined since Nov. 8, was the Kings' leading scorer
during the playoffs last spring and was tied for the team scoring lead
this season before undergoing surgery Nov. 15 to repair a hernia and torn
abdominal muscle.</LD>
<TE>   Even without Palffy and Schneider, the Kings were 7-4-4 in December,
doubling their victory total from October and November.</TE>
<TE>   "We battled pretty hard," Murray said. "I'd like to think we're going
to battle just as hard when they come back into the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "They're two of our better players, and if you add two of your better
players to your lineup, it should increase your odds of winning.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's if everything else stays the same in terms of work ethic
and commitment to team defense. You can't give up anything else just
because you're adding them. You're not any further ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Felix Potvin, pulled in favor of Jamie Storr in the second period of
Saturday's 5-4 loss to the New York Rangers, will be back in goal
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "It was decided right after the game," Murray said. "It's going to be
Felix. He's our guy and he's got to get back in there. He's been
tremendous [over the last month]. He didn't have a good night, but he's
our guy."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Murray said of Storr, "His stock just continues to rise."</TE>

<TE>   But Texas Tech made six of eight free throws in the final 30 seconds

<LD>It might not always look like it from where Steve Lavin sits, but
UCLA is not the toughest job in the country.</LD>
<LD>   It certainly isn't at Duke, where it didn't used to matter much when
the Blue Devils weren't very good--and Mike Krzyzewski hasn't given
anybody reason to complain in years. Besides, Duke's fan base is more
national than local, with North Carolina owning much of the state.</LD>
<LD>   But it isn't the Tar Heel job, either. Matt Doherty might be about to
flirt with the first losing season at the school since Dean Smith's first
year, but the horde won't be calling for his head.</LD>
<TE>   The job with the most constant and focused scrutiny is at Kentucky,
the school that has won more basketball games than any other.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky basketball doesn't share the stage with a single pro team.
Even Louisville basketball is less a statewide phenomenon than a local
one. And basketball is completely ingrained in the state's culture.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the most interesting sidelight of Rick Pitino's return to
Rupp Arena as Louisville's coach was the unanticipated outpouring of
affection for Tubby Smith.</TE>
<TE>   The chants of "Tub-by, Tub-by," were more pronounced than the boos for
Pitino, the former Kentucky coach branded as a traitor for returning to
the state as Louisville's coach after resigning from the Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   The famous Louisville T-shirt reading "Got Pitino?" on the front and
"We do," on the back was worn by the Cardinal mascot.</TE>
<TE>   Against Louisville, a sign said, "Got Tubby?"</TE>
<TE>   Smith has never been embraced quite so fully as he was Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Tayshaun Prince, the smooth, versatile senior swingman from Compton
Dominguez High, called the crowd's reaction "overdue."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Wildcat players even chanted along with the fans.</TE>
<TE>   Forbid that Kentucky had lost to Pitino's Louisville team, though: It
might have been the end of Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they practically serenaded him after an 82-62 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly makes you feel good to know you're wanted. It feels good
to know you're appreciated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith won a national championship his first season at Kentucky in 1998
and has won the Southeastern Conference tournament three times.</TE>
<TE>   But he has endured criticism almost constantly, and verbal abuse was
heaped on his son, Saul Smith, during the two seasons he was the Wildcat
point guard before graduating last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt sorry for Tubby last year," said Pat Adams, a fan from
Madisonville, Ky., who drove 180 miles to get to the game. "They were
giving him heck for playing his boy. You don't mess with family."</TE>
<TE>   There have been missteps.</TE>
<TE>   Smith lost to Louisville the first two times he faced the Cardinals,
but has won the last three.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats started last season 1-3, then lost to USC in the NCAA
regional semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky opened this season with a loss to Western Kentucky, but has
since recovered with a classic performance in an overtime loss to Duke.</TE>
<TE>   There have been some off-court behavioral problems from time-to-time
as well.</TE>
<TE>   But the bottom line is that Smith is one of the most dignified,
respected coaches in the country and has many ties to the NBA, should his
welcome grow worn. (He has been rumored as an Atlanta Hawks coaching
candidate in the past and was an assistant to Rudy Tomjanovich for the
Olympic basketball team in Sydney.)</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky should be proud to have him.</TE>
<TE>   We'll see if this new embrace lasts.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody asked Smith if he heard all the chanting.</TE>
<TE>   A glint flickered in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, during the middle of the game, I can't really appreciate it,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll have to go back and listen again."</TE>
<TE>Hoosier State Champs</TE>
<TE>   When Butler defeated Indiana in the Hoosier Classic, it gave Butler
the best claim to an unofficial Indiana state championship.</TE>
<TE>   Butler--ranked 20th in the Associated Press poll and one of five
remaining undefeated teams--has beaten Indiana State, Purdue, Evansville,
Ball State and Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame, Valparaiso and IUPUI aren't on the schedule, but that's a
pretty fair run against state competition nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   Butler holds a special place in Indiana lore.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Plump, who made the winning shot in the 1954 state championship
for tiny Milan High that inspired the movie "Hoosiers," played for
Butler.</TE>
<TE>   Butler's Hinkle Fieldhouse was used for the movie's championship game
scene.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Butler wears an imaginary state crown, the Bulldogs can turn
their attention to another prospect: They might have the best chance of
any team in the nation at going undefeated.</TE>
<TE>   Duke still must face Maryland and Virginia a total of four times--and
either Duke's or Virginia's unbeaten season is guaranteed to end in
Atlantic Coast Conference play, if not both.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State faces perhaps the toughest conference road in the Big
12.</TE>
<TE>   Miami hasn't played a tough schedule yet--the Hurricanes get a test at
Georgetown tonight--and must face Boston College twice, as well as
contend with Connecticut and other Big East teams.</TE>
<TE>   Butler--thriving in its first season under Coach Todd Lickliter, has
only the Horizon League: Cleveland State, Detroit, Wisconsin Milwaukee,
Illinois Chicago, Wright State, Loyola, Youngstown State and Wisconsin
Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>Sinking in the Atlantic</TE>
<TE>   St. Joseph's and Temple are the twin disappointments of the Atlantic
10.</TE>
<TE>   Both were ranked in the top 25.</TE>
<TE>   Now neither is anywhere close.</TE>
<TE>   Temple (3-8) has lost six in a row--most recently losing to Penn in a
game in which even the Owl mascot was whistled for a technical foul.</TE>
<TE>   It's never very hard to guess where Temple's troubles lie: The Owls
are shooting 37.8% from the field, 29.2% from three-point range, and
59.2% from the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   St. Joseph's (6-4) has lost three in a row, including a game at home
to Gonzaga on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves St. Bonaventure--in its first season under Jan van Breda
Kolff, who left Pepperdine to return to the Northeast for family
reasons--to carry the flag at 8-3. (Xavier and Dayton also are 8-3.)</TE>
<TE>   Van Breda Kolff's Bonnies had an impressive victory over Connecticut
at Hartford--only to lose on the road against Kent in overtime Monday.</TE>

<LD>San Diego (7-5) at Cal State Northridge (2-8), 7--This is the final
nonconference game for the struggling Matadors, who are coming off a loss
at Brigham Young. Coach Bobby Braswell has had internal issues with which
to deal. He suspended forward Chris Davis and guard Armand Thomas for the
Brigham Young game for an undisclosed reason. They are expected to play
tonight. Junior guard Ed Estavan has started the last four games and had
a career-high 16 points against the Cougars. It is the first of four
consecutive home games for the Matadors. On Sunday, the Toreros lost to
Montana State in the championship game of the Holiday Stores Touch
America Classic. San Diego's senior guard Andre Laws is enjoying an
excellent season, averaging 20.1 points and 3.6 rebounds.</LD>

<LD>   Occidental (8-0) at Loyola Marymount (6-6), 7, KXLU-FM (88.9)--The
Lions are licking their wounds after a 15-point loss at Montana in which
Coach Steve Aggers was upset with their lack of effort. Of particular
concern was that the front line of Greg Lakey, Andy Osborn and Keith
Kincade was outplayed by the Montana forwards. Balance has been stressed
as seven players average between 6.1 and 11.5 points. Occidental plays in
Division III but the Tigers are no patsy. They have defeated their
opponents by an average of 29 points. Loyola plays at Portland State on
Saturday before heading into West Coast Conference play next week.</LD>

<HD>Stanford's Yamasaki Sending a Strong Message</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is much about Lindsey Yamasaki that suggests strength.</LD>
<LD>   Her 6-foot-1 frame isn't overly muscular but is solidly built. Her
handshake is firm, her voice strong. And when you watch her move on the
basketball court the Stanford senior doesn't bowl over people as much as
she explodes past them.</LD>
<LD>   Yamasaki is having a terrific final season for the sixth-ranked
Cardinal, who are 12-1 overall and in first place in the Pacific 10
Conference. She leads Stanford in scoring (17.7) and joins teammate
Nicole Powell as part of one of the best tandems on offense in the
country.</LD>
<TE>   She's one of a handful of elite Asian-American college basketball
players. Actually, she's an elite player who happens to be Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings up another question.</TE>
<TE>   If Yamasaki plays in the WNBA next season, as she's hoping to do, can
she be strong enough to carry the weight of expectations that will
accompany her?</TE>
<TE>   The WNBA won't say it publicly, but there's no doubt the league's
marketing department would love a player of Asian descent who can attract
Asian fans to the games.</TE>
<TE>   If Yamasaki can make the pros, she may be an instant focal point. She
may not make the immediate impact that Japan's Hideo Nomo and Ichiro
Suzuki have made on baseball, but the attention will be there.</TE>
<TE>   Yamasaki correctly says, for now, she is concentrating on the season,
and helping a young but talented Stanford team get to the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   "Our potential is unlimited," Yamasaki said. "Look at the Tennessee
game, [which is Stanford's only loss]. We didn't play well, and we were
right with them. And this year, at least in the top 10, teams seem on the
same level--everyone can beat everyone. We have a feeling on this team we
haven't had in a long time. We respect one another, we're excited for
each other."</TE>
<TE>   She admits, though, a pro basketball future is never far from her
thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't talk about it much. When people ask me, I say hopefully it's
in my future; it's something I'm aiming for. But I've had a rough
previous three [college] years. And if I finish well with a good season,
if I push myself to play the way I think I can, then I have a really good
chance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exciting knowing I could represent a whole different group of
people. A lot of the fans I bring [to Stanford] are Asian fans. A lot of
the little girls write me and say 'I want to be like you.' I'd never been
around that."</TE>
<TE>   Born 21 years ago in Oregon City, Ore., the youngest of three
children, Yamasaki led her Oregon City High team to four consecutive
state 4A championships.</TE>
<TE>   She entered Stanford in 1998. In her previous three seasons, dividing
time between basketball and volleyball, Yamasaki averaged 11.4 points,
4.6 rebounds, and battled various leg injuries.</TE>
<TE>   But there were always hints of greatness.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Yamasaki averaged 12 points, and was second in the Pac-10
in three-point shooting (42.5%) and free-throw shooting (82.2%).</TE>
<TE>   She further honed her game on the U.S. team that won a gold medal at
the World University Games in Beijing last August.</TE>
<TE>   That experience matured more than her jump shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I was able to step back and be on my own," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing a different role and having a championship experience, that
changed my perspective. I stopped worrying about 'me, me, me.' I wanted
my team to feel good."</TE>
<TE>   WNBA scouts profess some reservations about her quickness at the
professional level. But there is much about Yamasaki's game they like.</TE>
<TE>   "She can break a press, slash to the basket and create her own shot,"
a Western Conference scout said. "Where she goes in the draft probably
depends on the rest of her season, having a good NCAA tournament and a
good league tryout camp in Chicago in April. But this has been her best
year so far in basketball."</TE>

<HD>Feeling Ill, Olowokandi Sits Out Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Olowokandi was a late scratch for Tuesday's game against
the Portland Trail Blazers because of a case of food poisoning he
suffered after eating at a seafood restaurant on New Year's Eve. He
wouldn't divulge the name of the restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   Olowokandi had played 137 consecutive games since sitting out two
because of a sore left knee during the 1999-2000 season, but said that
resting Tuesday was the right decision.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to look after yourself," he said. "I did want to go, but it
was a last-minute decision not to play. We've got a game [tonight]
against Sacramento and one Friday against Denver. I probably would have
felt a lost worse [Tuesday] running around on the court."</LD>
<TE>   With Olowokandi sidelined, the Clippers were without two starters and
their top reserve guard. Lamar Odom sat out for the third consecutive
game because of a sprained right wrist, and Keyon Dooling remained
sidelined by a sprained left ankle. Olowokandi plans to play tonight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Piatkowski scored 10 points on three-for-six shooting in 25
minutes, the most he has played since suffering a strained right hip Nov.
30 against the Denver Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate word on whether the Clippers exercised their
opt-out clause in their six-year Staples Center contract. They faced a
Monday deadline to exercise that option, but it's believed they're
staying since no one connected with the team or the arena had heard
otherwise Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Sacramento, 7</TE>
<TE>   Site--Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Clippers 16-14, Kings 23-9.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Kings have won four consecutive games since losing to the
Clippers, 101-85, Dec. 22 at Staples Center. Chris Webber, battling a
nagging ankle injury, had his season-best 30 points during a 109-94
victory Sunday against the Boston Celtics.</TE>

<DL>MILWAUKEE
</DL>
<LD>Darvin Ham of the Milwaukee Bucks was arrested on what police said
was suspicion of violence against his wife.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-7, 240-pound forward was cited on suspicion of domestic
violence-battery, a misdemeanor, at about midnight Monday at a Milwaukee
home, Lt. John Andrews said.</LD>
<LD>   Ham paid $500 bail and was released Tuesday, a Milwaukee County jail
booking clerk said.</LD>
<TE>   "I am very sorry about the situation and for the anguish and
embarrassment this has caused my wife and our entire family, as well as
the Bucks organization, my teammates and fans," Ham said in a statement
released by the team Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ham called the incident "not representative of my character" and
promised to work with his family to rectify the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife means the world to me and I will not let one lapse in
judgment overcome my love and commitment to her and to our children," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee General Manager Ernie Grunfeld said he is confident Ham will
try to resolve the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very serious matter that shouldn't be taken lightly, and
with him it won't be," Grunfeld said. "Darvin and his wife and family
know they have the care and support of the entire organization behind
them."</TE>
<TE>   The Bucks, who lead the Central Division, play at Minnesota tonight.</TE>

<HD>Shaq Appears on Course After Light Drills</HD>

<LD>Shaquille O'Neal dressed in purple shorts and gold jersey for the
Lakers' sweat-it-all-out practice in El Segundo on Tuesday afternoon, and
actually participated in some light, walk-through exercises.</LD>
<LD>   While most of his afternoon was spent in a chair not far from Kobe
Bryant, watching practice, O'Neal appeared to maintain his course to play
Friday night against the Phoenix Suns.</LD>
<LD>   It will be O'Neal's decision, according to Coach Phil Jackson, just as
it was O'Neal's choice to rest his aching feet and then to go to the
injured list for at least five games, the NBA-mandated minimum.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson said O'Neal would test his feet--to review, that's a sore
small left toe and an arthritic big right toe--in a rigorous practice on
Thursday, although Jackson recently said a lighter practice schedule
probably would be best for O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal left without commenting, and Jackson said he did not ask him if
his toes were any less painful. There is a possibility that O'Neal would
have to play with the pain, even if it limits his game.</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, Jackson tried to cheer up O'Neal with a reminder that
he could be Arvydas Sabonis, or had to be Arvydas Sabonis, or once
guarded Arvydas Sabonis, or something. The point was somewhat murky.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to play within what the limitations are," Jackson said. "I
brought up to him a point that Sabonis was one of the best centers in the
world at one time. He had to play with a limited amount of action, but he
was still a very effective center. He wasn't Sabonis of the 1980s, but he
was the Sabonis of 1998-99, and he was still a very good player. So, you
know, you have to learn to play within those limitations. I don't think
that's going to happen to Shaq, but still there's a way to play with it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant experienced some swelling in his right side on Monday and did
not practice Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   He received therapy to his strained ribs starting an hour before
practice and said he would play tonight against the Denver Nuggets with a
pad over the area.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bryant stayed involved with the scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   "I was talking a lot of trash from the sidelines," he said, laughing.
"I was hyping everybody up."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his injury, Bryant has played at least 40 minutes in three of
the four games O'Neal has missed, and the schedule gets more difficult
from here.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very challenging stretch for us," he said. "We know that, but
we're looking forward to it. We're actually excited to get out on the
road to play."</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Lakers beat the Nuggets twice during their season-opening
run of 16 wins in 17 games. A lot has changed in the Nugget organization
since, not much of it good. Nick Van Exel wants out. Dan Issel is out.
And now comes speculation that Clyde Drexler will push interim coach Mike
Evans out. Denver General Manager Kiki Vandeweghe added Drexler to Evans'
staff on Monday. John MacLeod, a head coach in New York, Dallas and
Phoenix, has been moved from his consultant job to Evans' bench, as well.
Some believe the next Nugget coach will be Larry Brown, an old friend and
mentor of Vandeweghe's. The basketball hasn't been any better. The
Nuggets have lost five of six.</TE>

<HD>Clausen Leads Tennessee, 45-17</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Phillip Fulmer, who has coached quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Tee
Martin, thinks he's got another special one.</LD>
<LD>   Fulmer never really doubted Casey Clausen, but leading the No. 8
Volunteers to a 45-17 victory over No. 17 Michigan in the Citrus Bowl
sealed the coach's faith in the sophomore. Clausen threw three touchdown
passes and ran for two more Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Volunteers (11-2), who missed a chance to play in the Rose Bowl
when they lost to LSU for the Southeastern Conference championship on
Dec. 8, had not won a bowl game since beating Florida State for the 1998
national title.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll tell Casey in the off-season that the more he continues to work
and be as disciplined as I expect him to be, he'll be one of the all-time
greats Tennessee has had," Fulmer said.</TE>
<TE>   Clausen completed 26 of 34 passes for a career-high 393 yards and
threw two touchdown passes to Kelley Washington. He also connected on a
64-yarder with Jason Witten. During one stretch in the second half,
Clausen completed 10 straight passes.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee was favored by three points, but the final margin didn't
surprise Clausen.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime we play the way we are capable of playing, we can beat
anybody in America," said Clausen, who played at Mission Hills Alemany
High</TE>
<TE>   Travis Stephens scored on a three-yard run and Alex Walls had a
32-yard field goal to complete Michigan's worst bowl loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolverines chose to stop Tennessee's running game, but Clausen
made them pay. Stephens was held to 38 yards rushing, and receiver Donte
Stallworth actually outgained him on the ground with 44 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "Michigan has a great defense," Stallworth said, "but you can't stop
the run and the pass at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee rolled up 503 yards, the most Michigan allowed all season.
The Wolverines (8-4) had not given up more than 26 points this year and
saw their four-game winning streak in bowls end.</TE>

<DL>DALLAS
</DL>
<LD>Arkansas coaches had a month to find some weaknesses in the
Oklahoma defense. They couldn't do it.</LD>
<LD>   With major award winners Roy Williams and Rocky Calmus leading the
way, the No. 10 Sooners tied a school record with nine sacks and held the
Razorbacks to 50 yards in a 10-3 victory Tuesday in the Cotton Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Oklahoma (11-2) blew a chance to play in the Rose Bowl by losing to
Oklahoma State in its final regular-season game. The Sooners bounced back
with a vengeance, allowing Arkansas (7-5) only two completions for 13
yards.</LD>
<TE>   "Just amazing," Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops said. "I don't care who
you're playing, everyone would agree that's hard to do."</TE>
<TE>   Offense was the main reason the Sooners weren't able to defend their
national title, and it left a lot to be desired against Arkansas (7-5).</TE>
<TE>   New offensive coordinator Chuck Long stuck to a conservative plan and
produced only a one-yard touchdown run by Nate Hybl in the first quarter
and a 32-yard field goal by Tim Duncan to open the second half.</TE>
<TE>   That 10-0 lead seemed insurmountable, though, considering how the
Sooners were defending their turf.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas didn't get into Oklahoma territory until a short punt put it
there late in the third quarter. The Razorbacks drove past midfield once,
on a series that ended with a 32-yard field goal with 9:46 left.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, winner of the Bronko Nagurski Award for the nation's top
defensive player and the Thorpe Award for the top defensive back, had two
sacks.</TE>
<TE>   Calmus, a runner-up for the Nagurski and winner of the Butkus Award
for top linebacker, made nine solo tackles, two assists and recovered a
fumble.</TE>

<HD>South Carolina Edges Buckeyes</HD>
<DH>Outback Bowl: Bellisari rallies Ohio State from 28-0 deficit, but
Gamecocks win, 31-28, on late field goal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>With the score tied and nearly no time left, South Carolina kicker
Daniel Weaver knew his 42-yard field-goal attempt wasn't his best effort.
So he put his faith in the wind.</LD>
<LD>   The kick barely cleared the crossbar, allowing No. 14 South Carolina
to avoid a big embarrassment with a 31-28 victory over No. 22 Ohio State
in the Outback Bowl on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know what would've happened if that sucker didn't go
through," South Carolina coach Lou Holtz said.</LD>
<TE>   But the kick did, and the Gamecocks (9-3) had their second straight
Outback victory over Ohio State. South Carolina won last year's game,
24-7.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it wasn't my greatest kick ever, but I was hoping the wind
might take it," Weaver said. "I was lucky enough to make it."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Bellisari, playing for the first time since his November arrest
and suspension on drunk driving charges, led Ohio State from a 28-0
deficit to tie the score. But he had a pass intercepted by Sheldon Brown,
whose return to Ohio State's 29 with 23 seconds left set up Weaver's
first game-winning kick.</TE>
<TE>   Four plays and two Ohio State timeouts after the interception, Weaver
delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Petty, the game's MVP, threw for 227 yards and two touchdowns,
and Andrew Pinnock scored twice for South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   But none of that mattered when Bellisari got the Buckeyes (7-5) going.</TE>
<TE>   He ran for a two-yard score to close the third quarter, then hit
Darrell Sanders with a 16-yard scoring pass with 10:18 to go that cut the
lead in half.</TE>
<TE>   "We were at the lowest we've been all year when we were down 28-0,"
Bellisari said. "The team really pulled together and we showed some real
heart and grit right there."</TE>
<TE>   Bellisari, who was 21 of 35 for 320 yards, then drove Ohio State to
the South Carolina 18, but fumbled the snap. South Carolina linebacker
Jermiah Garrison recovered.</TE>
<TE>   On the next play, Derek Watson fumbled right back to Ohio State's Mike
Doss. Three plays later, Jonathan Wells' one-yard run made it 28-21 with
5:02 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State got the ball back on its 11 with 3:56 to play and Bellisari
completed six consecutive passes for 86 yards, tying the score on
Sanders' nine-yard catch.</TE>
<TE>   Cie Grant gave the Buckeyes a chance for victory at the end,
intercepting Petty with 1:12 left. A celebration penalty backed them up
to their 18, but no one at Raymond James Stadium was doubting Bellisari.</TE>
<TE>   However, Brown picked on Bellisari's long pass, returning it 37 yards.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Louisiana State ripped its way through the Illinois defense Tuesday
night, and, along the way left cleat marks all over the Sugar Bowl record
books.</LD>
<LD>   The Tigers, who rolled up a record 595 yards of offense, built a huge
first-half lead then held on for a 47-34 victory before a crowd of 77,688
at the Superdome.</LD>
<LD>   "Everything we were doing was just clicking offensively," Tiger
quarterback Rohan Davey said.</LD>
<TE>   "There came a point in the second quarter when Coach [Nick Saban] had
to tell me to settle down because I was out there trying to hit the home
run on every play."</TE>
<TE>   Illinois, confronted with a 27-0 deficit late in the second half,
battled back with four touchdowns in the second half but never recovered
from its stumble out of the gate.</TE>
<TE>   Given a month to dream up ways to slow LSU's offense, Illinois
presented just one dilemma for Davey: too many options.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Reed caught 14 passes for 239 yards, and Domanick Davis rushed
for four touchdowns--all Sugar Bowl records--and Davey, named player of
the game, scribbled his own name in the books with 31 completions and 444
yards passing.</TE>
<TE>   The 47-point effort set an LSU bowl record, surpassing the previous
mark of 45 against Michigan State in the 1995 Independence Bowl. It was
the highest scoring Sugar Bowl in history.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long two weeks," Davey said. "The last 20 minutes of
meetings, we were pretty much going to sleep. That's how comfortable we
were with the game plan."</TE>
<TE>   Illinois quarterback Kurt Kittner, a four-year starter, seemed to fall
asleep for the first two quarters. He wallowed through a five-for-17
first half and at one point was one for 14 for one yard.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out and were tight offensively," Illinois Coach Ron Turner
said. "We couldn't make anything happen. We dug ourselves too deep a hole
and couldn't get out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Kittner was jarred out of his slumber late in the second half,
completing three consecutive passes for a total of 75 yards and putting
the Fighting Illini on the scoreboard with a two-yard pass to Brian
Hodges.</TE>
<TE>   Kittner was a different quarterback in the second half, throwing three
touchdown passes and finishing with 262 yards on 14-of-35 passing. He
threw another touchdown to Walter Young and two to Brandon Lloyd.</TE>
<TE>   "The big plays were what hurt us in the second half," Saban said. "I
don't think they ever truly drove the football on us."</TE>
<TE>   Kittner, a four-year starter who completed 55% of his passes this
season, left about 30 newspaper and television reporters waiting for him
Sunday at a news conference. He never showed. Turner later said his
quarterback made a mistake by not attending the event, although it was
partly Turner's fault.</TE>
<TE>   "Kurt called me and said, 'Coach, I just don't want to do it,' "
Turner told reporters. "I said, 'Kurt, you don't have to do anything you
don't want to do.' His family is here and he said, 'Coach, I need to
focus in.' "</TE>
<TE>   But it was the Tigers who were focused in the first half, batting down
four Kittner passes at the line of scrimmage and just missing on three
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois could do little to stop the Tigers, who led 27-0 late in the
second half and sauntered into the locker room up, 34-7.</TE>
<TE>   "I was telling them, 'Guys, I know it's 34-7 but we're not that far
off,' " Turner said. "We were throwing passes and guys were just tipping
them or dropping them. We weren't that far off."</TE>
<TE>   LSU's first four touchdown drives began in Illinois territory,
including one that started at the five after Randall Gay stripped
receiver Lloyd and returned the fumble 19 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Davis scored the first three touchdowns on runs of four, 25 and 16
yards. He also returned three punts and a kickoff, a reminder of his
impressive versatility.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers have worked to find creative ways to get Davis on the
field. Not only is he a return specialist, but he started a game this
season as an extra defensive back. He moved into the No. 1 running back
role when sophomore LaBrandon Toefield, an All-SEC selection, suffered a
torn ACL in the second quarter of the conference title game against
Tennessee.</TE>

<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Chris Rix raced onto the field as the players filed off at the end
of the Gator Bowl, looking for the man whose faith had helped him weather
a difficult season at quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   When he got to Coach Bobby Bowden, the two embraced.</LD>
<LD>   "I gave him a hug and said, 'That was for you,"' the freshman said
Tuesday after leading the No. 24 Seminoles to a 30-17 victory against No.
15 Virginia Tech in the Gator Bowl. "We told each other we loved each
other. It was very important to get that win for him."</LD>
<TE>   The victory moved Bowden into a tie with Bear Bryant for second on the
Division I-A wins list with 323, four behind Penn State's Joe Paterno.</TE>
<TE>   Bowden, though, didn't want the focus on himself, not after Rix and
his team put a solid finish on what had become a year for learning.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a funny thing. It's something you nearly need to get out of the
way. It can become a distraction," the 72-year-old Bowden said. "And it
sure doesn't mean Bobby Bowden is in the same class with Bear Bryant."</TE>
<TE>   The victory extended to 16 Bowden's unbeaten string in
non-championship bowl games, and gave him 18 bowl wins, two behind
Paterno.</TE>
<TE>   And Rix, nearly benched by Bowden during the season, helped make it
happen with a wrist-flicked pass under intense pressure that Javon Walker
turned into a 77-yard touchdown to give the Seminoles the lead for good.</TE>
<TE>   The pass sparked a 17-point fourth quarter that allowed the Seminoles
(8-4) to put the Hokies (8-4) away.</TE>
<TE>   When Rix came back out for the next series, he did it again, finding
Walker behind corner Ronyell Whitaker again--this time for 50 yards--to
set up a field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Whitaker accepted the blame for the Hokies' loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of the reason we lost that game," the all-Big East
first-team cornerback said. "In fact, I know I was the reason we lost the
game."</TE>
<TE>   But in truth, it was Rix, Walker and a defense that limited the Hokies
to 95 yards in the fourth quarter that deserved the credit.</TE>
<TE>   Rix also hit Walker with a 23-yard scoring pass with 2:14 left, giving
the wideout four catches for 195 yards, a bowl record for Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   Rix, from Santa Margarita High, was 12 of 25 for 326 yards, two
touchdowns and one interception.</TE>
<TE>   "The receivers did their job and made me look good," Rix said.</TE>

<HD>Florida's Spurrier Throws Quarterback Changeup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>Instead of playing for the national championship as Florida once
hoped, the Gators are playing quarterback shuffle.</LD>
<LD>   Rex Grossman, the Heisman Trophy runner-up, won't start today's Orange
Bowl against Maryland because of a curfew violation--opening the door for
backup Brock Berlin in a move that looks suspiciously like Coach Steve
Spurrier's last-ditch effort to keep Berlin from transferring to Miami.</LD>
<LD>   Grossman was among five players who missed curfew Friday night. Two
other regulars, center David Jorgensen and defensive end Bobby McCray,
also were among the group and will not start.</LD>
<TE>   "They're eligible to play in the game, certainly," Spurrier said.
"Their coach will put them in accordingly when he sees fit."</TE>
<TE>   Berlin, the No. 1 recruit in the nation two years ago, visited the
Miami campus recently and was thought to be close to making a decision to
transfer and play for the Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier then announced Berlin would get a chance to play in the
Orange Bowl, probably in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   After Grossman missed curfew, Spurrier decided Berlin would start but
didn't make it official until Tuesday, the day before the game, though
word of his decision leaked out Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The start wouldn't be purely ceremonial, Spurrier said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever starts always gets an opportunity. That doesn't mean they're
going to finish. It means they're going to get an opportunity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We never start a guy and say, 'If you screw up, you're out.' It takes
a bunch of screw-ups before we take somebody out."</TE>
<TE>   Grossman, a redshirt sophomore, beat out Berlin for the job last
spring and set a school record with 3,896 yards passing, throwing for
more than 300 yards in all but one game.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin, a true sophomore, appeared in eight games, completing 60% of
his passes for 483 yards and nine touchdowns with one interception.</TE>
<TE>   Players were not available for interviews Tuesday, when both teams
changed hotels as part of a plan to avoid distractions the day before the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Spurrier's plan to play Berlin some, even before the
curfew violation, Grossman told the Gainesville Sun: "Maybe it's a
going-away party. I don't know. Brock is a great player. He may stay
here, and we may be in the same position this spring we were in last
spring."</TE>
<TE>   Grossman told the Associated Press on Monday he wasn't sure if he'd
start after missing curfew.</TE>
<TE>   Florida (9-2) blew its chance to reach the Rose Bowl and play for the
national title when it lost to Tennessee Dec. 1, failing to reach the
Southeastern Conference championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland, in contrast, is trying to cap a storybook season, going 10-1
in Ralph Friedgen's first season as coach after five consecutive losing
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   With an offense led by running back Bruce Perry and a defense led by
linebacker E.J. Henderson, Maryland's game plan is to put pressure on the
Florida quarterback--whoever he might be.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think [the quarterback situation] affects us at all,"
Friedgen said. "The other guy's pretty good.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to play whoever's on the field, and I'm sure Steve's going to
do whatever he has to do to win the football game."</TE>
<TE>   The question about Florida all along has been whether the Gators can
recover from their disappointment about not playing for the national
championship.</TE>
<TE>   Friedgen thinks that's a tall order.</TE>
<TE>   "But they're so talented, they can probably get away with it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether they can get away with missed curfews and Spurrier's lobbying
effort to get Berlin to stay will be revealed today.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a distraction at all," Spurrier said. "Like I
said, Brock and Rex, sometimes in practice you can't tell any difference
who's out there. Brock's a very good player who hasn't had a chance to
play.</TE>
<TE>   "We lose the game, you know what, you can blame it on me. If Rex plays
and we lose the game, you're going to blame it on me too. It doesn't
matter. We're going to play the guys we think deserve to play and earned
the right to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Brock Berlin's been to every off-season workout he's supposed to be
for two years, been on time for every meeting, been at practice every
day.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's any kid who deserves a chance to see what he can do, it's
Brock Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   "Some things happened. He's going to get a chance."</TE>

<DH>College football: Notre Dame's newest coach says all the right
things at first news conference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This was not the Tyrone Willingham most folks expected.</LD>
<LD>   At Tuesday's news conference in South Bend, Ind., to introduce media
and fans to the third Notre Dame football coach employed since Dec. 1,
the no-nonsense Willingham actually got off a couple of one-liners--then
cautioned that was the end of his night club act.</LD>
<LD>   Willingham takes his cues from Dennis Green, not Shecky Greene.</LD>
<TE>   "I won't be telling many jokes," Willingham said. "This is about as
good as it gets."</TE>
<TE>   Irish fans who suffered through last year's 5-6 season and five years
of relative mediocrity under former coach Bob Davie, may be heartened to
know Willingham is ready to get down to the business of restoring Notre
Dame football to glory.</TE>
<TE>   It is serious business.</TE>
<TE>   "That is my goal," he said. "That's why I'm here. To reach that level
of excellence this university has always had."</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame made history Monday when it hired Willingham, the first
African-American to lead an Irish program, with the larger goal of making
history again on the football field.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham, who turned 48 on Dec. 30, signed a six-year contract
reportedly worth about $1.5 million per year, which would make him the
nation's highest paid Division I coach.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham left the relative comfort of Stanford, where he led the
Cardinal to four bowl games in seven seasons, to take on the biggest
challenge in college football.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me it brings bright light," Willingham said of the scrutiny
he will endure under the Golden Dome. I've always said in my life if
you're doing the right things, it does not matter how bright the lights
or how many lights. But if you're doing the wrong things, it only takes a
flashlight."</TE>
<TE>   Willingham said the right things on his first day at work.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up a Methodist in North Carolina, but spoke of sneaking out of
church on Sunday mornings in order to watch Notre Dame highlights.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say it was all the voice of Lindsey Nelson," Willingham said
of the announcer's legendary voiceovers on Irish football games, "but
there was something there. Something that stayed with me."</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't a day in which many details were unearthed. Willingham
would not address the specifics of his hire, why Notre Dame passed him
over the first time when it hired Georgia Tech Coach George O'Leary on
Dec. 9, only to accept his resignation five days later after it was
learned O'Leary had fudged his resume.</TE>
<TE>   "I prefer not to go over those things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham would not impugn the performance of his predecessor, Davie.</TE>
<TE>   "None of that will exist," he said. "What I hope to bring is
consistency in everything I do. From the manner I walk, from the manner I
talk, from my actions with this football team."</TE>
<TE>   Willingham said his becoming the first black Notre Dame coach was
important, but not a major issue in his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this significant?" Willingham said in response to a question.
"Yes. I say it is significant. But I am, first and foremost, the football
coach at the University of Notre Dame. The young men will expect me to be
that."</TE>
<TE>   There were questions that Willingham could only begin to address.</TE>
<TE>   Who were his influences?</TE>
<TE>   In life, his parents, Willingham said.</TE>
<TE>   In football, he cited Minnesota Viking Coach Dennis Green and West
Coast offense architect Bill Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   What about his philosophy on recruiting?</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't recruit every day, you've missed the boat," Willingham
said.</TE>
<TE>   What about his coaching style? He led a wide-open, pro-style attack at
Stanford, yet Notre Dame has a history tied to the running game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm primed for this one, I want you to know that," he said of the
question. "As I understand the tradition, the focus is to win. My offense
is about winning. My defense is about winning. Special teams is about
winning.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we do is about winning."</TE>
<TE>   How about that tough-as-nails schedule? Notre Dame opens next year
against Maryland, followed by Michigan and Purdue. It plays at Florida
State.</TE>
<TE>   Can the Irish possibly keep pace?</TE>
<TE>   "It is what we have," Willingham said. "And if that is it, we must
prevail."</TE>
<TE>   What about the snow? Can Willingham, his wife, Kim, and their three
children adjust to the cold weather in South Bend?</TE>
<TE>   Willingham noted he was a Minnesota Viking assistant coach and played
college football at Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   "We do get a few drops of snow there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Could he please give an assessment of Notre Dame's talent level?</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is a fair question, but I would not comment on that,"
Willingham said. "What we have, what we don't have is not important to
me. What's important to me is whatever we have we take and make it the
absolute very best."</TE>
<TE>   The news conference was running late. Willingham found himself taking
glances at his watch.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to be forthcoming but also knew of the enormous mission on
which he was about to embark.</TE>
<TE>   "To say it is a dream come true is true," he said of his hiring.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham fancies himself a man of action, not words.</TE>
<TE>   "I will alert most of you in the media that I am very much to the
point," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The point to Willingham was not about answering questions about Notre
Dame.</TE>
<TE>   It was about finding answers.</TE>

<LD>So which defensive unit will show up for the Miami Hurricanes in
Thursday's Rose Bowl national championship game against Nebraska?</LD>
<LD>   Will it be the unit that came together in the middle of the season,
allowing no more than seven points over five consecutive games, two of
them shutouts?</LD>
<LD>   Or will it be the unit that hung on for a 26-24 victory over Virginia
Tech in the regular-season finale only because a wide-open Hokie receiver
dropped a conversion pass that would have tied the game? Had Ernest
Wilford caught that pass, the Hurricanes would have blown a 26-18
fourth-quarter lead.</LD>
<TE>   Miami defensive coordinator Randy Shannon says the difference in the
defense during those five dominating games was not the starters, who were
long gone in the latter stages of most of those games because they were
blowouts.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the freshmen who shut them out late in the game," Shannon
said.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Tech, of course, was another story, one that offers hope to
Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   "They ran the option on us on about 10 plays and they gained, like,
130 yards," Miami defensive tackle Matt Walters said. "If I was Nebraska
and I saw that and the option was my main weapon, I would probably get
excited."</TE>
<TE>   But, Walters said, the Cornhuskers shouldn't get too excited.</TE>
<TE>   "If we score seven points, that should be enough," he said. "That's
what we are thinking going in.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not worried. We face our own offense every day in practice and
it's one of the best in the nation. We don't focus on other teams. We
focus on ourselves. I don't say that in an arrogant way. I mean, we focus
on what we have to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes went to Staples Center on Sunday night to watch the
Lakers play the Houston Rockets.</TE>
<TE>   Miami safety Edward Reed came away shaking his head after meeting
Laker center Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "He makes Bryant [McKinnie] look like a puppy," Reed said.</TE>
<TE>   McKinnie, an offensive tackle, is 6 feet 9 and weighs 336 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Players get their inspiration in different ways.</TE>
<TE>   On his right hand, receiver Daryl Jones wears a ring signifying
Miami's 37-20 victory over Florida in last year's Sugar Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "This ring is motivating me to get a better one this year, so I can
put this one up in the cabinet," he said.</TE>

<HD>SWEET DREAMS</HD>
<DH>Miami's Payton Had No Complaints Growing Up in the Shadow of His
Father</DH>

<LD>Superman. Batman. Wonder Woman. Spiderman.</LD>
<LD>   Kids in search of a superhero need only turn on their television sets
to find a wide variety of colorful, costumed action figures.</LD>
<LD>   For J.P., however, there was only one superhero. He wore a uniform,
not a costume. Had a helmet, not a mask. And nothing, it seemed, could
stop him, not even kryptonite.</LD>
<TE>   J.P.'s hero was Walter Payton, the Hall of Fame running back of the
Chicago Bears and the leading ground gainer in NFL history.</TE>
<TE>   It was not a case of hero worship from afar. J.P. didn't sit around
dreaming of someday meeting the star player in person.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't have to. They lived in the same house.</TE>
<TE>   Because while J.P. is the name he prefers to go by, his full name is
Jarrett Payton. Walter was his father.</TE>
<TE>   There's a saying that no one is a hero to his valet. But that's not
true in this case. Rather than dim the illusion of greatness, the
father-son closeness enhanced it for Jarrett.</TE>
<TE>   "He was like a superhero to me," Jarrett said. "It was like he had
superhuman powers. He had a body like steel. Nothing fazed him.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember he would come home after a game with ice all over his
body. I know he had to be hurting. But he never let on. And by the next
day, he was fine. He was a warrior."</TE>
<TE>   All Jarrett has today are his memories. Walter died just over two
years ago at 45 of a rare liver disease.</TE>
<TE>   He left some big footsteps to follow, footsteps that lead over, around
and through the best defenses the NFL could throw at him in his brilliant
13-year career. It would seem daunting to try to follow those footsteps,
especially as Walter's only son. That could only lead, it would seem, to
unflattering comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Jarrett has followed those footsteps, not only by playing
football, but by becoming a running back. He will be in Thursday's Rose
Bowl national championship game as the backup fullback of the Miami
Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   Just another challenge for Jarrett, who seems to take them on with a
shrug of the shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   How many 12-year-olds would take on the challenge of delivering the
introductory speech for their father at the Pro Football Hall of Fame?</TE>
<TE>   When Walter asked his son to do the honors, Jarrett responded with
such a moving speech that his father's usually impassive face cracked,
tears forming in Walter's eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't that bad," said Jarrett of the experience. "I am more
nervous giving a speech in school in front of my classmates, people I
know. At the Hall of Fame, I didn't really know anybody."</TE>
<TE>   How many high school running backs would take on the challenge of
trying to equal one of his father's cherished accomplishments?</TE>
<TE>   Because his mother, Connie, worried that he would get hurt, worried
that he would come home with the same number of ice bags that covered his
father's body, Jarrett did not play football in his first two years at
St. Viator High in Arlington Heights, Ill. So instead, he tried soccer
and excelled at it.</TE>
<TE>   But when Jarrett was finally allowed to put a football in his hands,
it was the opponents who were getting hurt. Playing
quarterback/tailback/receiver, Jarrett amassed 2,842 all-purpose yards as
a senior.</TE>
<TE>   And one day he decided he was going to take a shot at one of his dad's
marks.</TE>
<TE>   Walter held the NFL record for yards gained in a single game, 275,
until the Cincinnati Bengals' Corey Dillon surpassed that figure last
season with 278.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrett came up short--by 10 yards, rushing for 265. He probably would
have made it if his coach hadn't sat him out for the final two series.</TE>
<TE>   What did Walter think of his son's big game?</TE>
<TE>   "He told me I did really good," Jarrett said. "That was a really big
compliment coming from him because he was a quiet person, wasn't one to
blow smoke at you." A lot of college recruiters thought Jarrett's running
ability was a big thing, so many that he was courted by 27 schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm recruiting you," said Miami offensive coordinator Rob Chudzinski,
"because you're Jarrett Payton, not because of who your dad is."</TE>
<TE>   That meant a lot to Jarrett, who introduces himself as J.P. because he
wants to be judged for what he does, not for what his last name is.</TE>
<TE>   Chudzinski is glad he pursued Jarrett.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't go there to talk to him about the old glory days of the
Chicago Bears," he said. "I went because I think he might be even a
better athlete than his dad."</TE>
<TE>   That has yet to be demonstrated.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrett won't be the starter at tailback Thursday, or even at fullback
where he was moved before this season. He wasn't even the backup fullback
until starter Najeh Davenport broke a foot in practice after Miami's last
regular-season game. Jarrett hasn't had much playing time. After gaining
262 yards and averaging 4.9 yards with one touchdown at tailback as a
freshman, he was a redshirt last season. This year, he has carried the
ball only 14 times for 26 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Why hasn't his highly touted talent come out? Life, it seems, has
often tackled Jarrett short of his goal. His freshman season was
interrupted by his father's death and nagging injuries. A foot injury
resulted in the redshirt year. Before spring practice this year, he
suffered a bad cut on his foot when he jumped out of a boat and landed on
sharp coral. And last summer, he suffered cuts and bruises in a car
accident that could have been much worse.</TE>
<TE>   He knows how he avoided death.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my dad," Jarrett said.</TE>
<TE>   Kind of nice to have your own personal superhero.</TE>

<HD>This Streak Is Enough to Bowl Everyone Over</HD>
<DH>Nebraska: Thursday's game against Miami will mark the Cornhuskers'
33rd consecutive postseason appearance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Nebraska Cornhuskers are in a bowl game. So what else is new?</LD>
<LD>   Nebraska has played in bowl games of every stature, from the majors to
the fringe games.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday in the Rose Bowl, in the bowl championship series title
game against Miami, Nebraska will play in its 33rd consecutive bowl game,
an NCAA record. It will be Nebraska's 40th bowl appearance overall, which
dates to the 1941 Rose Bowl, a 21-13 loss to Stanford in it's only other
appearance in the Pasadena bowl game.</LD>
<TE>   The last time the Cornhuskers stayed home for the holidays was in
1968, after a second consecutive 6-4 season.</TE>
<TE>   But coach Bob Devaney's 1969 Husker squad went 9-2, including a 45-6
victory over Georgia in the Sun Bowl, and Nebraska has played in the
postseason since. In the team meeting room, there's a large emblem that
bears a notation or artifact from all the bowl games in that streak.</TE>
<TE>   "Subtle, huh," said Nebraska Coach Frank Solich, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   The streak is a powerful recruiting tool.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get to 33 bowls in a row by accident. A lot of good things
have to happen," Solich said. "You have to have a lot of great players
over the years. Located in the middle of the country as we are, and only
1.5 million people in the state, you have to get out of the state to
recruit and find players.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that's interesting, no matter where you go in this country
people know about the program, what our teams have accomplished over the
years and the tradition. That always gets you a foot in the door."</TE>
<TE>   It had an impression on a local athlete who left Southern California
for the heartland.</TE>
<TE>   "Back in high school I was used to winning games. I don't like to
lose," said sophomore offensive tackle Dan Waldrop, who graduated from
Wilmington Banning High. "And a couple of days before the signing date,
[defensive back] coach [George] Darlington said if I wanted to win games,
I needed to come here and be part of a great history. I really didn't
know much about the bowls, but they told me when I was here on my visit.
And it ultimately made me want to come here."</TE>
<TE>   And once a recruit becomes a Cornhusker, he learns quickly that bowl
games are more than a source of pride at Nebraska. They are a way of
life.</TE>
<TE>   "We pay attention to [the streak]," junior running back Dahrran
Diedrick said. "It's not an option to think we're not going to a bowl. If
that happened, it would be weird in Lincoln. And it will take a miracle
for it not to happen."</TE>
<TE>   From 1982-98 Nebraska played in 17 consecutive Jan. 1 or Jan. 2 bowl
games (Orange, Sugar, Citrus and Fiesta), all under coach Tom Osborne.
The Cornhuskers went 7-10 in this stretch, but lost seven consecutive
bowl games from 1988-94. That streak ended when Nebraska defeated Miami
in the 1995 Orange Bowl. The Cornhuskers have won six of their last seven
bowl games, the lone loss to Arizona in the 1998 Holiday Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   All three of Nebraska's Heisman Trophy winners have played during the
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Rodgers, the 1972 winner, was a one-man show in the 1973 Orange
Bowl, scoring four touchdowns and passing for another in the 40-6 rout of
Notre Dame. Mike Rozier, the 1983 recipient, rushed for 147 yards in the
1984 Orange Bowl against Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Crouch, this season's winner, gets a final chance to win a
national title. The only postseason game he did not appear in was the
1998 Fiesta Bowl, after missing the 1997 season as a medical redshirt
because of an ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   "Being here five years and being in five bowl games really means a lot
to me," Crouch said. "It's made my college career more enjoyable to be
able to do something like that, whereas a lot of teams don't get that
opportunity to do it year after year."</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska or its opponent has played for the national championship in
13 bowl games during the streak. Bowl victories gave the Cornhuskers
outright or shared titles for the 1970, '71, '94, '95 and '97 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Miami has a 3-2 edge over Nebraska in bowl games and has defeated the
Cornhuskers twice with the national championship at stake. The most
memorable was the 1984 Orange Bowl game when Miami prevailed, 31-30,
after Nebraska failed late on a two-point conversion.</TE>
<TE>   But once Thursday's game is over, Nebraska will go home and make
another notation on the emblem in the team room.</TE>
<TE>   And make space for No. 34.</TE>

<HD>Diedrick Overcomes the Doubters</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Running back Dahrran Diedrick had much to prove when he became the
first high school player from Canada to receive a football scholarship to
Nebraska.</LD>
<LD>   Though he'd rushed for nearly 1,900 yards in nine games as a senior at
Cedarbrae Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, Ontario--he gained 311 in
11 carries in his final game--he knew that other Cornhusker recruits
questioned his talent when he arrived in Lincoln, Neb., in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   "When I came in, they were like, 'How good could he be?"' Diedrick
said. "Those guys were from Texas, California, Florida and every other
state. I was the foreigner. I had to come in and use toughness. Whatever
happens, you bounce up and you show the other guys that you are willing
to stick your nose in there and get the job done and be physical."</LD>
<TE>   After a redshirt year and two seasons as a backup, the 6-foot,
225-pound Diedrick used his bruising running style to gain 1,299 yards
and score 15 touchdowns in 233 carries this season. He led the Big 12
Conference in rushing, even though he shared time with Thunder Collins
and played in an offense with Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Eric
Crouch.</TE>
<TE>   Diedrick was born in Jamaica and moved to Canada when he was 12. He is
one of three players from Canada on the Cornhusker roster.</TE>
<TE>   "Michigan, Ohio State and the teams closer to Canada have had Canadian
players for a long time," Diedrick said. "It's finally being figured out
by others that there are a lot of athletes up there [in Canada] not
getting recognized. So a lot of schools are going up there now to make
sure they don't lose out on a great player."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska practiced for the final time Tuesday, working out for 1 hour
45 minutes in helmets and sweats.</TE>
<TE>   Diedrick, who had ankle problems earlier this season, and defensive
end Demoine Adams returned to practice after sitting out Monday for
precautionary reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers will have a walk-through today at either a high school
or the Beverly Hilton Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "The attitude of the team is excellent and they are ready to play some
great football," Nebraska Coach Frank Solich said. "It's time to wrap
this thing up."</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers are eight-point underdogs for their national
championship game Thursday against Miami, but Solich said he is not using
that to motivate his team.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never tried to build up the fact that we've been favored in
almost every game that we've played since I can remember, so we don't try
to play that up," Solich said. "With all that's riding on it you wouldn't
have to search very far for extra motivation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Nebraska contingent attended the taping of the "The Tonight Show
With Jay Leno" Tuesday afternoon, but Solich said he was not planning to
join his players.</TE>
<TE>   "They are looking forward to it and they're excited about the
opportunity but we have an opportunity to play in a national championship
game too, so I think I may need to make sure that I'm prepared," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Randy Garcia, who played quarterback at Nebraska after being named
City Section player of the year at Los Angeles Wilson High in 1972,
watched the Cornhuskers practice Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, an LAPD officer for 22 years, backed up Vince Ferragamo at
Nebraska in 1975 and 1976 and started in 1977. Ferragamo was the City
player of the year at Wilmington Banning in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said he had intended to play college football on the West
Coast. But that was before Tom Osborne, then preparing for his first
season as Nebraska's head coach, visited his home.</TE>
<TE>   "When he comes out to your house in northeast L.A. and makes the
impression that he does, guess what? You're going to Lincoln," Garcia
said.</TE>

<LD>There are at least seven linemen weighing 300 pounds or more who
are scheduled to play today in the CaliFlorida Bowl at 2:30 p.m. at El
Camino College.</LD>
<LD>   The play of the offensive and defensive lines could be critical in
determining which team wins the third annual meeting between top high
school football players from California and Florida.</LD>
<LD>   California won the inaugural game, 21-11, at the Rose Bowl two years
ago. Florida won last summer, 17-14, at UC Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   An all-star game matching players from the City Section and Southern
Section will be held at 10:30 a.m. Admission is $10 for the doubleheader.</TE>
<TE>   Florida has Gavin Dickey from Tallahassee Lincoln and left-hander Dan
Shula from Ft. Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas as its quarterbacks. Dickey
is being recruited by USC, Florida and Clemson.</TE>
<TE>   California counters with Brigham Young-bound Ben Olson of Thousand
Oaks, UCLA-bound Drew Olson of Piedmont and Arizona-bound Ryan O'Hara of
Pasadena Muir. Some recruiting experts say Ben Olson is the No. 1
quarterback prospect in the nation. Drew Olson, also an outstanding
baseball player, has impressed coaches in practice with his accuracy and
athletic ability.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the linemen who figure to make the difference. California's
linemen are so feisty that Arizona-bound Tim Volk of Sherman Oaks Notre
Dame got into a scuffle with Long Beach Poly 300-pounder Winston Justice
during practice on Sunday. They had to be separated by coaches.
Afterward, they shook hands.</TE>
<TE>   California's hopes rest with having five players from Southern Section

<HD>Valencia Turns Corner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Valencia's roller coaster season is on the rise.</LD>
<LD>   The Vikings are 9-7, but four of their losses have come to teams
ranked in The Times' Top 25. Two weeks ago, Valencia went 2-2--all
against ranked teams--in the Artesia tournament. One of the victories, a
57-50 decision over La Puente Bishop Amat, was particularly important.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we turned the corner in the Bishop Amat game," said Jerry
Mike, Valencia's third-year coach. "We set that game as a test, to make a
statement to ourselves. They were undefeated, and they were so big.
They're kind of like Saugus. We don't have a whole lot of size, so that
was a big win."</LD>
<TE>   Valencia's low-post defender is senior Holly Fenet, who is 5 feet 9.
Inexperience is another challenge. Two freshmen, guards Kelley Tarver and
Daviyonne Weathersby, and a sophomore, Tamaiya Smith, are starters.</TE>
<TE>   "She's loaded with talent," Mike said of Smith, who is averaging 8.4
points. "We're expecting big things by the end of the year. By far, she's
our most talented player, not taking anything away from Kelly. She's got
a great shot, but she's inconsistent."</TE>
<TE>   Tarver is the only player averaging in double figures. Notable among
her performances was a 27-point effort in a loss to Long Beach Poly, a
game in which she made 23 of 24 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Saugus, which plays host to Valencia on Thursday, is one of the teams
the Vikings must beat if they are to win a share of their third
consecutive Foothill League title. The other prime competitor is league
favorite Newhall Hart, which is ranked No. 14 this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Against the top teams, I'm a little surprised at how we've done,"
Mike said. "With the exception of Ventura [a 71-48 loss], we've been in
every game, and we've beaten some teams I didn't expect [to beat]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Planes, trains or automobiles: Irvine Woodbridge was supposed to play
in a tournament in Reno during the preseason, but the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks changed its plans. Instead, Woodbridge played in the Orange
County Championship for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "We had two or three families that were uneasy about the traveling,"
said Eric Bangs, Woodbridge's coach. "We had three different flights set
up, all of them got canceled, and it got to be where it consumed the
program for three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the most disappointed because I like playing those good
Northern California teams."</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos was in the same boat, only worse. Both the boys' and
girls' teams were to play in Daytona Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "Three or four parents on the boys' side and two or three on our side
said they wouldn't let their kids fly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford said 14 boys and girls teams dropped out of the Daytona Beach
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ankle treatment: Erika Arriaran of Norco, one of top freshmen in the
Southland, has been bothered by a sore ankle, but her coach, Rick
Thompson, said it's a mysterious ailment.</TE>
<TE>   "She doesn't know how she hurt it," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Arriaran scored only seven points--the first time this season she
failed to score in double figures--in a 69-55 loss against fourth-ranked
Fullerton Troy.</TE>
<TE>   After scoring only one point in the second half against Troy, Arriaran
did not play Saturday against Fullerton Rosary.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Hills Commanding in Hawaii</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Laguna Hills flexed some muscle in Hawaii last weekend, going 8-0
and winning the Iolani High dual-meet tournament.</LD>
<LD>   The Hawks were barely challenged in their matches, winning by an
average score of 61-11. They won two matches without giving up a point
and their closest match was a 45-23 victory over Kamehameha, the
top-ranked team in Hawaii. Laguna Hills defeated Livermore, 49-17, in the
final.</LD>
<LD>   Brayden Mills (103 pounds), Steve Jarmie (112), Patrick Gyotoku (119),
Donovan Johnson (140), David Coles (145) and heavyweight Jerod Simpson
all went undefeated in the tournament, but the highlight of the trip came
after the tournament.</LD>
<TE>   The team attended a luau, where 145-pounder Ken Wales was picked out
of the crowd to do a hula dance on stage.</TE>
<TE>   "It was absolutely hilarious," Laguna Hills Coach Cliff Jarmie said.
"We were rolling on the ground laughing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Add Hawaii: Laguna Hills remained in Hawaii until today, giving
Jarmie, an avid surfer, time to check out the waves on Oahu's famed North
Shore. Jarmie said he heard reports of 20-foot waves there so he might
seek out less intimidating rides.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent $80 to ship my boards down here," Jarmie said. "So I guess
I've got to use them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   R and R: Temecula Valley, which last wrestled at the Reno tournament
Dec. 22, is off until a Southwestern League opener Jan. 10, but this will
be the last lull in the schedule for the Golden Bears.</TE>
<TE>   Temecula wrestles in the Riverside County championships Jan. 11-12,
the Five Counties Jan. 18-19 and in the Canyon Springs tournament Jan.
26-27. After that, it's league finals and then the Southern Section
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be weekend tournaments and overnight trips every weekend from
here on out," Temecula Valley Coach Arnold Alpert said. "We need to take
some time off while we can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dueling champions: Calvary Chapel meets Bakersfield on Friday night at
Bakersfield in one of the most highly anticipated dual meets in recent
memory.</TE>
<TE>   Calvary Chapel has won seven of the last nine state championships,
including the last two. Bakersfield, with six wrestlers who placed in the
state tournament last year, is considered the favorite to win the state
title this year.</TE>
<TE>   All six of Bakersfield's returning state qualifiers, including
three-time state champion Darrell Vasquez, are ranked No. 1 in the first
edition of the California Wrestling state rankings, released Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Calvary Chapel had eight wrestlers place in the state meet last year,
but only Mario Estrada and Joe Williams return.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Top dogs: Jeff Bristol of Temecula Valley and Williams of Calvary
Chapel are ranked No. 1 in their weight class in the first edition of the
California Wrestler.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol, a 140-pounder, won the Reno Tournament of Champions Dec. 22.
Williams, who wrestles at 171 pounds, finished fifth in the state last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Calvary Chapel is ranked No. 4 as a team, the highest among Southland
schools. Bakersfield is No. 1, followed by Clovis Buchanan and Poway.
Temecula Valley is No. 7 and Arroyo Grande is No. 10.</TE>

first day of 2002 was one of the more surprising of his hall-of-fame
career.</LD>
<LD>   Snow Ridge, an 18-1 shot making his first start in California, tracked
4-5 favorite Freespool for the first three furlongs, then took charge
into the stretch under jockey Mike Smith to win the $109,500 El Conejo
Handicap by 31/2 lengths Tuesday in 1:03 for the 51/2 furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   A winner of seven of 16 lifetime, Snow Ridge, a 4-year-old Tabasco Cat
colt owned by Bill Young's Overbrook Farm, earned the second graded
stakes win of his career. He had won the Kentucky Cup Sprint at Turfway
Park on Sept. 22 and has now won at five different tracks. Besides
Turfway and Santa Anita, Snow Ridge has been successful at Saratoga,
Monmouth Park and Churchill Downs.</LD>
<TE>   Second to the late Charlie Whittingham, who had 204 Santa Anita stakes
wins, Lukas has gotten off to a good start at the current meet. He has
two stakes victories through the first six days after managing only three
during the 2000-2001 meet. Lukas won the Sir Beaufort with Orientate on
opening day a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   Explicit, the 5-1 third choice in a race reduced to eight starters
when Ceeband and Stormy Jack were scratched earlier in the day, finished
second, a nose in front of 4-1 second choice Rio Oro.</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Kent Desormeaux, who rode the runner-up, lodged a claim of foul
against Snow Ridge for alleged interference at the start, but it was
quickly dismissed by the stewards.</TE>
<TE>   Freespool, trying to win the El Conejo for a third time, faded to
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Xtra Heat made it 18 victories in 23 starts with an easy win over five
opponents in the $81,925 Interborough Handicap at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   The 125-pound highweight and 3-10 favorite, the 4-year-old Dixieland
Heat filly quickly opened up two lengths on her rivals and rolled to a 5
1/2-length win over 5-1 second choice City Fair. In remaining perfect in
three starts on the Aqueduct inner track, Xtra Heat completed the six
furlongs in 1:11.</TE>

<LD>New York Jet coaches assembled Tuesday to prepare for the Oakland
Raiders on Sunday, all under the cloud of an apparent rift between
quarterback Vinny Testaverde and offensive coordinator Paul Hackett.</LD>
<LD>   The Jets can't score touchdowns, and Testaverde and Hackett are being
blamed.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Terry Bradway said he believes the differences between
Testaverde and Hackett are nothing more than competitive tension.</LD>
<TE>   "My impression is that they've had a good relationship from the spring
on," Bradway said. "Everybody's frustrated by what happened on Sunday.
Obviously, we had a great opportunity and we didn't take advantage of
it."</TE>
<TE>   Hackett's play-calling and game-management continue to be questioned.
On Sunday, Testaverde threw a short pass over the middle with 13 seconds
to play. The clock ran out and Buffalo won, 14-9.</TE>

<HD>Jockey Stimpson Killed in Auto Accident</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Los Alamitos rider, 29, won the last two runnings of
prestigious Million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jockey Dusty Stimpson, who scored the biggest win of his career
less than a month ago aboard Your First Moon in the $1,256,600 Los
Alamitos Million, was killed early Tuesday morning in a single-car
accident.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of the accident, which occurred as Stimpson and his
girlfriend, Jody Behunin, were returning home from a New Year's Eve
concert in Bakersfield, is under investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Stimpson, 29, was the passenger in a car driven by Behunin when it
struck a guard rail, then a bridge abutment at the intersection of the 5
and 60 freeways entering Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Stimpson and Behunin were ejected from the vehicle. He was killed
instantly while Behunin, who works as an assistant trainer to Santiago
Rodriguez at Los Alamitos, was taken to County-USC Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   According to veteran trainer Arthur "Curley" Ortiz, a longtime friend
of Stimpson who had also attended the concert in Bakersfield, Behunin was
in critical but stable condition late Tuesday afternoon with multiple
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "He was like my son," Ortiz said. "We were very, very close. He was
one of the best people I've ever known. He was a good rider and a good
person. He never had a bad thing to say about anybody.</TE>
<TE>   "We had gotten rooms in Bakersfield, but Dusty wanted to get home
early because he said he had some personal things he needed to take care
of."</TE>
<TE>   A native of Ogden, Utah, Stimpson has been riding at Los Alamitos
since 1994 and his 44 career stakes victories put him 15th on the
all-time list at the track. He began his career at Wyoming Downs in the
middle of 1990.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, he was the second-leading rider in terms of earnings with
nearly $1.8 million and was seventh in victories with 78, including 12 in
stakes races.</TE>
<TE>   His win on Your First Moon, who is trained by former star rider Danny
Cardoza, was his second in a row in the Million. He won the race for the
same connections on Dashing Knud in 2000. It was one of three lucrative
wins for Dashing Knud that year and he was named the champion 2-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Stimpson won the All American and Los Alamitos Derbies with
3-year-old champion Old Habits and the Bull Raustus, MCI World Com
Challenge Championship and Pat Hyland Handicaps with Hateful Hanna, the
top distance quarter horse of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Dusty's one of the best and most underrated jockeys in the
country," Cardoza once said. Attempts to reach the trainer Tuesday were
unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all in complete shock and we would like to extend our sincere
condolences to his family," said H. Rick Henson, Los Alamitos president
and general manager. "Dusty was a gentleman on and off the track and we
will miss the class and talent that he brought to this sport."</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos has had its share of tragedy in recent months. Last
March, trainer Bob Gilbert was critically injured when he was beaten and
robbed of $4,000 early one morning in a remote area of the track.
Gilbert, who is hoping to return to training this year, had been at the
Pechanga casino in Temecula and was returning to his barn when he was
attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Three months ago, talented jockey Oscar Andrade, 21, was left
paralyzed when involved in a spill and last weekend jockey Iggy Puglisi,
a regular on the thoroughbred circuit in Southern California, suffered
three fractured vertebrae and a broken right knee in a spill and probably
will be sidelined for several months.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz said a memorial service is planned for Stimpson in Southern
California and said the rider will be buried in Utah. Stimpson is
survived by his parents, two brothers and a sister.</TE>

<LD>A Northern California man who collects movie memorabilia topped 50
other bidders in an online charity auction held by New Line Cinema
for a Triumph motorcycle used in the Tom Cruise movie "M:I-2," the
follow-up to "Mission: Impossible" (Highway 1, Dec. 5).</LD>
<LD>   The bidder, who asked New Line not to disclose his name, paid
$14,103 for the Triumph Speed Triple, one of two bikes that survived
the filming of "M:I-2" (eight of the 955-cc Triumph motorcycles were
used).</LD>
<LD>   New Line said it received 51 bids on the bike, which was enhanced
by the film's special-effects crew with bullet holes in the body
panels and rearview mirror. Bidding closed Dec. 18.</LD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Motorists who wouldn't think of driving after having a couple of
beers don't think twice about getting behind the wheel after taking
sedating medicine.</LD>
<LD>   But they should, some recent medical studies have found, because
driving under the influence of some medications, even
over-the-counter drugs, can be as dangerous as driving drunk.</LD>
<LD>   Until recently, the issue of medicine and its effects on driving
received scant attention.</LD>
<TE>   Concerned that commonly taken medicines may lead to more motor
vehicle accidents than previously believed, the Food and Drug
Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board
co-presented a November meeting at which experts debated how best to
deal with the potential hazards.</TE>
<TE>   Among the questions experts are asking are whether current warning
labels on medicines should be more specific and whether the blood of
crash victims should be tested for levels of legal medications.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how the debate is resolved, consumers would do well
to be more aware of the dangers of mixing legal drugs and
driving--and to know that being under the influence of legal
medications can be grounds for a traffic citation, just as with being
under the influence of alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1987, the NTSB has investigated more than 100
accidents--involving cars, trucks, buses, boats, planes and
trains--that have been attributed at least in part to the drivers' or
operators' use of over-the-counter or prescription medicines.</TE>
<TE>   That number may appear minuscule in the context of the 6
million-plus police-reported motor vehicle accidents in 2000, but
government experts believe it could represent the tip of the iceberg.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll continue to collect information," said Lauren Peduzzi, an
NTSB spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB has made several safety recommendations to the
Transportation Department and the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   The board asks that toxicology testing be required in a sample of
accidents to identify how prevalent a role medications may play in
crashes and that the FDA establish an easily recognizable warning
label for all prescription and over-the-counter medicines that could
interfere with an individual's ability to drive.</TE>
<TE>   In a study conducted at the University of Iowa, a sedating
antihistamine was found to affect driving performance more than
alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Lead author Dr. John M. Weiler, a professor of internal medicine,
presented his views at the recent government meeting. In his earlier
study, he asked 40 subjects who suffered from ragweed allergy to rate
their level of drowsiness while driving on a simulator after taking
diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or fexofenadine (Allegra), both
over-the-counter antihistamines taken for allergies, and after
drinking alcohol or taking a placebo pill.</TE>
<TE>   When subjects took the diphenhydramine, they strayed out of their
lanes more often and had worse steering control, for instance, than
when they took the fexofenadine, which is a non-sedating
antihistamine, or after drinking alcohol. Worse, the subjects'
self-reported drowsiness while on diphenhydramine did not correlate
with their description of their performance.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't realize they are impaired," Weiler said in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   After Weiler's report appeared in the Annals of Internal Medicine
in March 2000, Harvard University researchers questioned his study
design and pointed out that the manufacturer of Allegra helped fund
it. But Weiler's study also was funded by the National Institutes of
Health, and he points out that a substantial body of evidence, not
just his recent research, links some antihistamines to drowsiness.</TE>
<TE>   Besides antihistamines, many other over-the-counter and
prescription medicines can adversely affect drivers, including pain
relievers, anti-anxiety medicines and antidepressants, according to
an NTSB report on the subject issued in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   After a 1998 Greyhound bus accident in Pennsylvania that killed
the driver and six passengers, a test of the driver's blood revealed
he had taken diphenhydramine before the crash, the NTSB report noted.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists also can get into trouble with muscle relaxants and cold
remedies with codeine, said David Nelms, a California Highway Patrol
traffic officer and drug recognition expert. He teaches colleagues
how to recognize when drivers are impaired, whether from alcohol or
over-the-counter, prescription or illegal drugs.</TE>
<TE>   In this state, CHP Officer Bob Granieri said, operating a motor
vehicle while under the influence of prescription or over-the-counter
drugs that adversely affect driving skills is a violation--the same
as driving under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or illegal
drug--under Section 23152(a) of the California Vehicle Code. And it
does happen, he and other officers say.</TE>
<TE>   Some drivers are unaware of how even a legal drug will affect
them.</TE>
<TE>   "People think, 'The doctor prescribed it; it's OK,'" Nelms said.
But some people take too much, trying to get quick relief from
symptoms, he said; others deliberately abuse the drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Some, like those in Weiler's study, are simply poor judges of how
a medicine's side effects could impair their driving.</TE>
<TE>   Individuals vary greatly in how they react to a medicine, Weiler
and others say.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmaceutical industry experts are divided about whether existing
labels on drugs need improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say the labels are adequate, but the labels can also be
improved," said Dr. Bert Spilker, a senior vice president at the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group
for makers of prescription medicine.</TE>
<TE>   One suggestion, he said, is to make the labels more specific,
perhaps even including a time period for caution, such as, "Do not
drive for four hours after taking this medication." But he also notes
that individuals respond differently to medication.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Bill Soller, director of science and technology for the
Consumer Healthcare Products Assn., a trade group for makers of
nonprescription drugs, believes existing labels, which warn of
drowsiness and other potentially adverse effects, are adequate. In a
survey commissioned by the association, Soller said, 95% of consumers
said they read drug warning labels before first-time use.</TE>
<TE>   Even if medicines make drivers drowsy, he said, "there are
compensatory mechanisms," such as turning on the car radio and
drinking coffee.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers are becoming more aware of the need to avoid using
sedating medicines when they need to drive, said Sona Minas, a
registered pharmacist at Sav-On Drugs in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   "Many customers look for the least-drowsy antihistamine," she
said, and they often seek her advice on which over-the-counter
medicine to get.</TE>
<TE>   Until the FDA decides whether more should be done to warn drivers
about drugs that might be hazardous, consumers can take label
warnings more seriously, Weiler of the University of Iowa said.</TE>
<TE>   If a label warns that impairment or drowsiness are potential side
effects or that the user should not operate machinery, he said, "take
it seriously."</TE>

<DH>Twin crossovers from Toyota and Pontiac are aimed at
budget-minded drivers looking for a more car-like sport-ute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was easy at first. There were cars. There were trucks. And ne'er
the twain would meet.</LD>
<LD>   But auto makers these days are piling complexity upon intricacy as
they strive to fill niches no one knew existed, or thought needed
filling, just a year or two ago. The twain have, indeed, met.</LD>
<LD>   The result is the "crossover," and Toyota Motor Corp. and General
Motors Corp.'s Pontiac division are responsible for the latest
iterations: the Matrix and the Vibe, twin tall compacts with five
doors, the looks of a futuristic sport wagon, the storage capacity of
a smallish sport-utility vehicle and the manners of a well-balanced
sedan.</LD>
<TE>   As with any attempt to moosh several things together, compromises
were made, so there are other vehicles out there that will do the
job, perhaps even better. But there's not much in the same price
range of about $17,000 to $22,000 --an estimated range because Toyota
hasn't announced its final pricing.</TE>
<TE>   The 2003 Matrix and Vibe are the first in a subspecies of
crossover that looks more like a car than an SUV but maintains some
of the sport-utility characteristics that buyers find attractive. The
cars will start rolling into Toyota and Pontiac dealerships this
month.</TE>
<TE>   The reason we're dealing with two competing brands in one review
is that you really can consider the two as one--a Vibatrix, let's
call it. They share the same automotive DNA, springing from a project
developed by Toyota to be a joint production with GM, which chose its
Pontiac brand as the retail outlet.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota says the Matrix is a CUV, or "crossover utility vehicle."
Pontiac calls the Vibe a blend of "sports car, sport wagon and SUV."</TE>
<TE>   Both say the package is fun to drive, fun to look at and practical
as all get out. The fun parts generally are true--despite a big
caveat with the high-performance versions, which we'll get to--but
there's room to question the degree of practicality.</TE>
<TE>   These are, after all, compacts. Though they don't skimp on
passenger room, they lack the cargo capacity and hauling muscle of
some potential rivals. Chrysler's PT Cruiser has more space with the
rear seats folded down, and Toyota's RAV4 has more horsepower and
torque than all but the high-performance versions of the Matrix and
Vibe.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath their sheet-metal skins, the cars are identical--in
addition to being built off Toyota's new Corolla platform, both
employ Toyota suspensions, transmissions and engines.</TE>
<TE>   Even the interiors are the same: attractive mesh-woven fabric
upholstery and deep-set red-lighted instruments mounted in
chrome-rimmed binnacles, making for a decidedly Pontiac look. The
cars offer plenty of head-, leg- and elbow room; comfortable,
supportive seats; and a plethora of hidey-holes and lidded storage
compartments. The package inside is marred only by some flimsy-
feeling plastic parts, a shortcoming in many economy-priced cars.</TE>
<TE>   Park a Matrix and a Vibe side by side, and the similarities
created by the Toyota-designed basic envelope make the kinship
apparent, even though the only sheet metal they share is the roof
panel.</TE>
<TE>   So it won't be technology or performance, utility or ride
quality--or even build quality, because both are manufactured under
rigorous Toyota standards--that will differentiate.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it will be pricing, resale value, appearance and the
respective reputations of their makers that will determine the
markets for the two cars.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota clearly has the edge when it comes to reputation, but
Pontiac provides the better-looking version. And with the cost of
entry starting at $16,900, Pontiac is likely to beat Toyota's
still-undeclared pricing by at least a few hundred dollars for each
of the three models: front-wheel drive, all-wheel drive and sports
performance.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota, which will announce prices and specifications for the
Matrix models Thursday, should have the edge in resale value,
although as word gets out that the Vibe is really a Toyota in Pontiac
drag, that advantage could evaporate.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies say they are aiming at the youth market.</TE>
<TE>   But visually, Pontiac went straight for that young crowd with a
sport-wagon look complemented by a well-done mix of scoops and flares
and roof racks for hauling gear. Toyota opted for a safe-and-sane,
mature styling treatment with smoother body panels and softer lines;
it ended up with a vehicle that is evocative of a European five-door
hatchback and will probably make its best first impression on the
over-30 crowd.</TE>
<TE>   So score one for GM, whose brand designers took a basically
complete vehicle from Toyota and personalized it for Pontiac in a
winning package that goes a long way toward making up for the
disjointed, lumpy look of the unfortunate Aztek, a crossover that
goes in another direction, blending aspects of SUV and minivan.</TE>
<TE>   Looks aside, the Toyota and the Pontiac exhibited little
difference on the road, based on a Monday-to-Friday commuting week
with the up-model Matrix XRS and the single day we spent testing all
three versions of the Vibe.</TE>
<TE>   The basic versions come with the Corolla's 1.8-liter,
130-horsepower four-cylinder engine (cut to 123 horsepower in the
all-wheel-drive model because the exhaust pipes were rerouted to
accommodate the AWD drive line).</TE>
<TE>   The performance models--the six-speed manual Matrix XRS and Vibe
GT--boast a high-revving 180-horsepower four-cylinder engine taken
straight from the Celica GTS.</TE>
<TE>   The nature of the engine, with its variable-valve timing and lift
system, is to deliver its considerable horsepower with moderate
amounts of torque to back it up--a mere 130 foot-pounds, just 4% more
than kicked out by the base model.</TE>
<TE>   In an engine with an 8,200 rpm redline, most of that torque kicks
in at a tooth-gritting 6,800 rpm. Cramming it all up into the high
end of the rev range forces one to drive like a street racer in lower
gears and to violate most speed laws in the upper ranges to enjoy the
extra power.</TE>
<TE>   The downside of the 180-horsepower models is they are little fun
when they aren't being pushed. And the performance engine demands
premium fuel. One saving grace: It gets an estimated 21 miles per
gallon in the city and 28 on the highway.</TE>
<TE>   If going fast--a lot--isn't your thing, it may be best to consider
either the base front-wheel-drive model or the all-wheel-drive
version.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, they offer automatic transmissions, the choice of
most drivers these days; it's a Toyota four-speed automatic, optional
on the base model and the only tranny available on the AWD version.</TE>
<TE>   Both versions use regular-grade fuel and deliver better fuel
economy, up to 30 mpg city and 36 highway in the base model with
five-speed manual transmission.</TE>
<TE>   The little four-banger gets noisy when prodded, and needs a lot of
prodding, but is a smooth and quiet power plant when running at
cruising speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of make or model, Matrixes and Vibes are built on a
tight, well-tuned Toyota platform and use proven Toyota running gear,
so steering is responsive, braking is good, and with either the stock
16-inch tires and wheels or the optional 17-inchers (not available on
the all-wheel-drive models), a Vibatrix sticks tight to the road.</TE>
<TE>   The AWD version of the Vibe was especially impressive as its
automatic was perfectly matched to the engine, omitting the constant
up- and down-shifting that is the bane of so many small-engine,
automatic-transmission combinations in hilly or mountainous driving
conditions. And the Toyota-built AWD system--which puts nearly all
the torque up front until wheels start slipping, then directs as much
as 50% of the pulling power to where it is needed most--kept the Vibe
securely anchored even on some treacherously loose surfaces in the
Santa Monica Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the two vehicles have far more pluses than minuses.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly appealing is that the back seats fold down to form a
flat floor from tailgate to the back of the driver's seat, complete
with a sliding cargo-hook system that makes it easy to secure all
sorts of stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Final words: Each twin is a winning attempt to economically bridge
the gap between car and SUV with a bias for the car side of the
equation.</TE>
<TE>   The Pontiac's stronger styling statement might make it the
favorite of younger buyers who can see past the nameplate.</TE>
<TE>   But even 60-year-olds, whether on a budget or just seeking a nice
second or third car for the garage, will be attracted to the
combination of fun and function.</TE>

<HD>A Candy Store for L.A. Drivers</HD>
<DH>Event * Auto makers will showcase more than 1,000 models at
the 98th Greater Los Angeles Auto Show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARRY SORENSEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Think of the 2002 Greater Los Angeles Auto Show as a chance to design
your perfect car or truck.</LD>
<LD>   No, there won't be a booth where you can create your dream machine
on a nifty computer- assisted-design program. But the show, opening
Saturday, is a chance to let auto manufacturers know what you want,
in a venue where they will be listening closely--and even paying
consumer research firms to divine your automotive likes and dislikes.</LD>
<LD>   "For car makers, shows are all about concepts and reactions to
concepts," said Art Spinella, vice president of CNW Marketing
Research in Bandon, Ore. "The key focus is to showcase new ideas,
gauge reactions and build enthusiasm. We conduct focus groups during
and after shows to do just that."</LD>
<TE>   Of course, whether you're a car buff or an everyday commuter, you
may be seeking more from the experience than the chance to influence
yet another rendition of the ubiquitous sport-utility vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Those in the market for a new vehicle can looky-loo to their
hearts' content, comparing more than 1,000 models from 40-plus
manufacturers in an environment devoid of salespeople. Owners looking
to customize their current cars or trucks can check out the latest
aftermarket trends in oversize wheels, effects kits, exhaust systems
and more.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had millions, I'd waste it all," said Victor Boyce, a
39-year-old data analyst from Van Nuys who as a kid started attending
the show with his father and this year plans to take his own
21/2-year-old son. "I go so I can dream about all the stuff I'll
never have."</TE>
<TE>   Although the North American International Auto Show in Detroit
reigns as the country's top such consumer event, Los Angeles has
gained respect in the last four or five years, said spokesman Barry
Toepke, noting the two dozen North American and world debuts at the
show and a growing media presence.</TE>
<TE>   This year's show, the 98th, runs through Jan. 13 at the L.A.
Convention Center, with promoters hoping to beat last year's
attendance of 935,000. The event, under the direction of General
Manager Andy Fusezi, is again endorsed by the more than 250 members
of the Greater Los Angeles New Car Dealers Assn. The Times returns as
the show's media sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the events of Sept. 11 fresh in Americans' minds and all
indicators pointing to the recession continuing at least through
midyear, analysts and industry insiders remain optimistic about
prospects for this year's show and the 2002 auto sales season in
general.</TE>
<TE>   That confidence is reflected in the fact that manufacturers have
not scaled back on floor space or their usually elaborate exhibits,
spokesman Toepke said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. will use this year's show as something of a
coming-out party for its Western operations. The company will present
nearly 97,000 square feet of displays from its Ford and Irvine-based
Mazda, Mercury and Premier Automotive Group luxury brands (Aston
Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln and Volvo), which completed their
move Nov. 9 to Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "The L.A. auto show exemplifies why we moved here," said John
Clinard, Ford's Western region public affairs manager. "It's the
largest concentrated market of our buyers. We've moved into the
market. It's a natural for us to look at this as the home show and
unveil major new models and concepts here."</TE>
<TE>   More broadly speaking, the company finds some positive news, in a
year in which it took its share of knocks, in recent robust industry
sales.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been an almost trend-defying propensity for consumers to
buy new cars, which has been helped by incentive programs like 0%
financing," Clinard said, referring to the no- and low-interest loans
started by archrival General Motors Corp. and matched by Ford and
some other major manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, 2001 sales are widely expected to top 17 million units
when final tallies are issued Thursday, second only to the 17.4
million chalked up in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "2002 looks like it's going to be a really strong year too,"
analyst Spinella said, forecasting unit sales next year of 16.7
million, which would rank as fourth-best ever.</TE>
<TE>   California remains a big factor in any forecast, accounting for
12% of U.S. auto sales, Spinella said. And Los Angeles show goers
tend to be serious buyers.</TE>
<TE>   "In L.A., 20% of attendees are serious about buying within a year,
50% within 18 months," Spinella said. "Compare that to [shows in]
Chicago, which is maybe 10% to 12%, and New York, which is around 5%,
and you can be sure the car makers are watching L.A. very closely.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is important because of its location and the people who make
up the market. They tend to be younger and more open to new ideas.
That makes L.A. a better place to show a concept car than, say,
Detroit. At the L.A. show, you get a good sense of what people are
going to like in the future."</TE>
<TE>   This year's two dozen North American or world premieres at the
L.A. show will include the 2002 BMW 7-Series sedans and the company's
2003 Mini Cooper S; Chrysler's 2004 Crossfire coupe; Honda's
gasoline-electric hybrid 2002 Civic; the 2003 Hummer H2
sport-utility; the 2002 Jaguar S-Type and 2003 S-Type R;
Lamborghini's 2002 Murcielago; the 2002 Maserati Spyder, which marks
the company's return to the U.S. market after a 10-year absence; the
much-anticipated 2003 Nissan 350Z; the 2003 Pontiac Vibe and Toyota
Matrix twins; Porsche's 2002 Carrera 4S and 911 Targa; and
Volkswagen's 2002 New Beetle Turbo S and Passat W8.</TE>
<TE>   Notable concept cars will include a convertible version of
Chrysler's popular PT Cruiser; the Ford Forty-Nine, inspired by the
classic 1949 Ford; the Honda Model X, a "crossover" vehicle that
merges pickup with SUV; Suzuki's GSXR-4 two-seater, a blend of car
and motorcycle; and the Volvo PCC II performance wagon.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There are, by most industry counts, 55 sport-utility vehicle models
available in the U.S. today and 18 more in the wings.</LD>
<LD>   Citing concerns about size, safety and fuel inefficiency, some
critics say that's 73 SUV models too many.</LD>
<LD>   But now at least two more are on the way: Toyota Motor Corp.
announced recently that its Lexus division will introduce the
mid-size GX 470 next January, giving it three luxury SUVs, and Honda
Motor Co. said its American subsidiary will roll out a new full-size
model this summer, the Pilot.</LD>
<TE>   For those who fret about SUV proliferation, Honda is getting rid
of the Passport, a re-badged Isuzu that barely sells, so it still
will have only two SUVs. But the net result of the announcements is
that we're up to 74 models.</TE>
<TE>   The reason? SUVs are highly profitable and auto makers aren't
known for restraint. They'll keep building SUVs as long as customers
keep waving money at them. And there are a lot of SUV buyers out
there.</TE>
<TE>   Sales through November were up 12.1% from the first 11 months of
2000 and, at 3.6 million units, accounted for 22.6% of all passenger
vehicle sales in the country.</TE>

<HD>Environmentalists Fret Continued Growth of Light-Truck
Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As auto shoppers in the U.S. move closer to making the light truck
their preferred vehicle, environmentalists are raising concerns that
gas-gulping pickups and sport-utility vehicles will prolong the
country's dependence on foreign oil and speed the process of global
warming.</LD>
<LD>   Purchases of light trucks, including minivans, accounted for 50.5%
of all passenger-vehicle sales in the U.S. for the first 11 months of
the year. Some analysts are predicting that when December sales
figures are released Thursday, 2001 will become the first year in
which trucks account for more than half the market.</LD>
<LD>   Of particular concern to environmentalists is the continuing
popularity of SUVs, which typically are less fuel-efficient than
passenger cars and are widely used for everyday travel--often with
just one or two occupants in vehicles built to carry five to seven
people.</LD>
<TE>   "We burn 1.2 million more barrels of gasoline per day because SUVs
and light trucks are less efficient than cars," said Jason Mark,
clean vehicles program director for the Union of Concerned
Scientists. "That's about twice as much oil as we import from Iraq,
or three-quarters of what we import from Saudi Arabia."</TE>
<TE>   Mileage figures from the Environmental Protection Agency show
that, on average, light trucks consume 40% more gasoline than cars,
adding as much as $25 billion a year to retail gasoline sales.</TE>
<TE>   The additional carbon dioxide emitted as that extra fuel is burned
by the light-truck fleet traps heat in the atmosphere and contributes
to global warming, Mark and other environmentalists say.</TE>
<TE>   Although auto makers have pledged to improve truck mileage,
environmentalists complain that auto makers are moving too slowly.</TE>
<TE>   Recent studies by Mark's group and by the National Academy of
Sciences have found that auto makers could dramatically improve truck
fuel economy with existing technologies, such as direct fuel
injection, variable-valve engine control, lighter frames and
six-speed manual and automatic transmissions that more effectively
manage engine output.</TE>
<TE>   But auto makers argue that adding such technologies would boost
costs and force them either to subsidize purchases or watch
profitable truck sales decline.</TE>

<HD>New-Car Owner Thinks Dealer May Have Taken Things Too Far</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I purchased a Volkswagen Passat with 95 miles on the
odometer. It was sold to me as "new." How many miles can a car have
on it and still be considered new?</LD>
<LD>   --J.M.H.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: A vehicle can be described as "new" in California until it
is sold and registered for the first time with the Department of
Motor Vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   DMV officials say there is no odometer reading in the definition
of a new vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Section 430 of the California Vehicle Code defines a new vehicle
as one constructed entirely from new parts that has never been the
subject of a retail sale; registered with the department; or
registered with the appropriate agency or authority of any other
state or other political entity.</TE>
<TE>   New cars and trucks typically have no more than a few dozen miles,
accumulated after they drive off the factory assembly line.</TE>
<TE>   New vehicles take on a few miles while driven in storage lots on
their way to a dealership. Once there, they can be driven by
prospective buyers on test drives, adding a few miles at a time.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, dealers also swap same-model vehicles to satisfy a
customer who wants a specific color or equipment package. In such
cases, the vehicles may be driven across town, which can be quite far
in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The 95 miles on your Passat is on the high side but certainly not
high enough to raise suspicion that it was used extensively by
dealership employees as a personal car.</TE>
<TE>   But mileage is another issue in negotiating price. It is always
important to inspect the specific car you are buying, including
checking the mileage. Then you can at least try to negotiate a lower
price based on the mileage.</TE>
<TE>   Q: My 1998 Civic will soon reach 90,000 miles, which is the
mileage at which Honda recommends changing the timing belt. However,
the dealer's service department says I should also replace the water
pump because the new belt is tighter and will put more strain on the
old pump. Is this true?</TE>
<TE>   --F.L.D.</TE>
<TE>   Q: It's time to replace the timing belt on my 1994 Camry. Is it
cheaper to replace other belts at the same time?</TE>
<TE>   --F.C.</TE>
<TE>   A: Replacing a water pump and other belts during a timing-belt
repair can be a smart investment.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendation is based not on that Honda dealer's reasoning
but on the expectation that the water pump will fail at some point
and that changing it during a timing-belt replacement would add
little additional cost.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, water pumps commonly fail after 90,000 miles. Such
failures are unpredictable, can leave you stranded and in the worst
case can cause extensive engine damage.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, the timing belt provides the power to the water
pump. With the belt already off, changing the pump may require only a
small fraction of an hour of labor. But if you have to change the
pump later, you'll pay for three or four hours of labor to remove the
timing belt all over again.</TE>
<TE>   Even on vehicles that have a separate serpentine belt to power the
water pump, it's often the case that the timing belt must be removed
to get to the pump or the bolts that hold it.</TE>
<TE>   It's also smart to replace other belts when changing the timing
belt, since you should be charged no additional labor.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Memmolo, a recognized national expert on engine mechanics,
says it also is wise with high-mileage cars to replace the idler and
tension pulleys, since their bearings can wear out.</TE>

<HD>Auto Industry Still Trying to Right Itself After Tough Year</HD>
<DH>The terrorist attacks, a faltering economy and wholesale
shifts at the executive level combined to create turmoil amid high
sales, low profits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES and JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a record year of sales in 2000, what could the auto industry do
for an encore in 2001?</LD>
<LD>   Against all expectations of a year ago, the industry is set to
record its second-best sales year, projected to come in between 17
million and 17.2 million units when results are announced Thursday,
just short of last year's 17.4 million.</LD>
<LD>   But the robust numbers come at a withering cost for the
traditional U.S. Big Three auto makers. Because of the unprecedented
cheap financing deals offered to reverse plunging sales after the
September terrorist attacks, the near-record volume brings little or
no profit--or even losses.</LD>
<TE>   Crisis after crisis brought down Chief Executive Jacques Nasser at
Ford Motor Co. Rival General Motors Corp. hired veteran product guru
Robert Lutz to oversee a revamping of its lineup. Both companies
overhauled their North American executive leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese and South Korean auto makers, meanwhile, continued their
assault on domestic dominance, scoring their biggest gains in a
decade and largely without following the Big (but Dwindling) Three
down the interest-free financing chute.</TE>
<TE>   GM pioneered the no-interest deals when sales stalled nationwide
as consumers stayed away from showrooms in the days after Sept. 11.
The no- and low-interest financing saved sales in the fourth quarter,
clearing out accumulated dealer inventory. But the auto makers don't
foresee the strong demand continuing, and they have eased production
going into the new year.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question" that the cutbacks will hit sales hard in the
first and possibly second quarters of the new year, said Diane Swonk,
chief economist with Bank One Corp. in Chicago, noting: "We've got
sales with no production. They've still got to replenish the bare
cupboard."</TE>
<TE>   Still, said David Littmann, chief economist for Comerica Bank in
Detroit, there are signs of recovery beyond the short-term profit
woes.</TE>
<TE>   "The Big Three are cutting costs pretty dramatically. I don't
think next quarter will go to hell in a handbasket," he said. "For
the first quarter, I think they can show a turnaround in the profit
situation."</TE>
<TE>   The auto makers, though grateful the metal is moving, groan at the
cost.</TE>
<TE>   "Whereas October was ridiculous, now it's only horrific," Ford
Chief Financial Officer Martin Inglis said. He noted that Ford
offered fewer no-interest loans in December and a greater mix of
low-interest financing.</TE>
<TE>   But he is not saying goodbye to rebates and cheap loans by any
means.</TE>
<TE>   "If the industry falls off, what will manufacturers do? My
hypothesis," he deadpanned, "is they'll juice the market up" with
more marketing and incentives.</TE>
<TE>   To Inglis, any marketing costs above 10% or 12% of revenue are of
concern, but third-quarter costs leaped from 14% to 16%, with October
even higher than that.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe that after 9/11 the industry needed to be
jump-started," he said. "The only question was: Is this the way to
jump-start it?"</TE>
<TE>   Ford Stumbles</TE>
<TE>   It was a tumultuous year in Michigan, with the steady exodus and
reshuffling of top automotive executives continuing from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere were things more in turmoil than at Dearborn-based Ford,
which suffered financial setbacks, extraordinary charges related to
the Firestone tire recalls, delayed vehicle launches and finally the
ouster of CEO Nasser. William Clay Ford Jr., the nonexecutive
chairman and a great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, took
Nasser's place, putting a family member at the helm for the first
time since 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble appeared on many fronts.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits continued to mount in the wake of hundreds of deaths in
Firestone-related crashes, mostly involving Ford's Explorer
sport-utility vehicles. By last January, the auto maker had spent
$500 million to replace 6.5 million tires recalled the previous
August by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.; Ford in May announced its own
recall of 13 million additional Firestone tires at a cost of $3
billion.</TE>
<TE>   The redesigned 2002 Explorer was recalled twice, and the all-new
2002 Thunderbird was delayed, making it the fourth new Ford in a row
plagued by launch setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Europe veteran Nick Scheele was brought in to oversee North
American operations, even as Ford announced it would slash up to
5,000 white-collar jobs and cut its earnings forecast and dividend
for the first time in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   The September attacks hurt sales at Ford and at the other major
auto makers, but Ford's third-quarter loss marked the first
back-to-back quarterly red ink in nearly 10 years, to the tune of
$692 million.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in late October, Bill Ford showed Nasser the door.</TE>
<TE>   As if the sea of bad news weren't enough, analysts warn that Ford
will suffer from a lack of new product hitting the market.</TE>
<TE>   "GM has a relatively low but steady replacement rate," said John
Casesa, Merrill Lynch's senior auto industry analyst in New York, in
a December report on the U.S. auto market in 2002-2005.</TE>
<TE>   "Ford, as many investors already fear, faces a pronounced product
drought until 2005," Casesa said, noting that, by contrast, "the
Japanese and Korean manufacturers will have massive launch activity
in the 2003 model year."</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese plan to replace a whopping 91% of their current
volume in the next four years or so, meaning "Ford's product line
will lag the industry's in freshness," Casesa said. The main arrivals
in 2002 are a new Expedition and its sister truck, the Lincoln
Navigator, as well as the smaller Lincoln Aviator SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Ford told The Times last month that he recognizes the
challenges ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "We had our day in the sun and [GM] took a pounding, so now it's
our turn in the barrel," he said. "We certainly have issues."</TE>
<TE>   He and a new management team are going through every business Ford
conducts to weed out the distractions and concentrate on building
cars and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at everything, top to bottom," Ford said. "We're
going through all the consultants--and all the excuses as to why they
can't get their jobs done."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't ever want to look back," the 44-year-old scion said. "I
want to keep the best of what makes Ford special. Part of that is a
focus on product. Part of running a big company is listening to what
people tell us. We have to spend a lot of time communicating."</TE>
<TE>   GM Hums Along</TE>
<TE>   At General Motors, CEO G. Richard Wagoner could boast of rising
quality, productivity and, importantly, market share as 2001 came to
a close. New products such as the Chevrolet TrailBlazer and Cadillac
Escalade SUVs were hits.</TE>
<TE>   GM, the world's largest auto maker, hired ultimate Detroit car guy
Lutz as vice chairman to turn around product design.</TE>
<TE>   "GM has been down for so long, I think they emerged from 2001 as a
leader through zero-percent financing, which was very well executed
and clearly communicated; by halting their slide in market share; and
by hiring Bob Lutz to do product development," said Tom Libby,
director of industry analysis for J.D. Power &amp; Associates in Detroit.
"None of that could have been predicted a year ago."</TE>
<TE>   Wagoner &amp; Co. also could point to GM's renewed prowess in light
trucks, as it sold 143,992 more SUVs, pickups and minivans than Ford
through November, regaining the leadership crown for the first time
since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Cut it any way you like, said George Pipas, Ford's director of
sales analysis and reporting, "[but] they can't say they have the
best-selling brand [Ford], the best-selling SUV [Ford Explorer] or
the best-selling truck [Ford F-150 pickup]."</TE>
<TE>   It's a rivalry that all will be watching given the new management
teams in place: Scheele and other key additions at Ford, and Lutz and
new North America President Gary Cowger at GM.</TE>
<TE>   "The big story next year will be whether GM's risky realignment at
the top will pay off," said Michael Flynn, director of the University
of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation.
"Will there be new product and spirit at GM, and will the products
work in the marketplace?"</TE>
<TE>   A Subdued Chrysler</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Group--the Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep
brands--plodded through a restructuring plan announced in February,
which included shedding 26,000 workers, taking a $2.8-billion charge,
wringing price concessions from suppliers and selling non-core
assets.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we are very well alive, so it's not killing us, but
clearly we think we should not only worry about the volumes, but that
we should strive to rebuild margins," Chrysler Group Chief Executive
Dieter Zetsche told The Times last month.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler, already wading in red ink, is an unwilling player in the
escalating no-interest finance game, which costs the auto makers an
estimated $1,500 to $3,000 per vehicle sold.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like taking a drug addict who is getting used to the monthly
fixes, and now you don't get your monthly fix anymore and suddenly
you develop all these withdrawal symptoms," Chief Operating Officer
Wolfgang Bernhard said. "Then the market goes down, and you've got to
have the guts not to go to the drug anymore to get another fix."</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler, in any case, is going ahead with the much-anticipated
Crossfire, which originally was to be introduced Sept. 12 at the
Frankfurt International Motor Show in Germany but was postponed
because of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Crossfire--"essentially a coupe built on Mercedes' superb
last-generation E-Class platform," analyst Casesa of Merrill Lynch
noted--will be unveiled Thursday at the Greater Los Angeles Auto
Show.</TE>
<TE>   "The car should look great, perform terrifically and achieve
quality levels perhaps below Mercedes' but far above Chrysler's," he
said, comparing Daimler's luxury and mainstream lines.</TE>
<TE>   While turmoil swirled in Detroit, No. 1 Japanese auto maker Toyota
Motor Corp. was poised at the end of November to become the first
importer to grab a 10% share of the U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the Asian brands increased their market share to slightly
more than 30% while the domestics saw their grip slip to an all-time
low of 63.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Importers Ascending</TE>
<TE>   But 2001 was no aberration. What happened with Toyota and the
other Asian brands, in particular red-hot Hyundai Motor Co. of South
Korea, has been building for years. And if anything, pressure on the
domestic brands from Asian auto makers will increase this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a combination of things, including the bigger Asian
brands entering segments, like full-size trucks and sport-utility
vehicles, that had been exclusively the domain of the domestics,"
said analyst Wes Brown of Nextrend, a Thousand Oaks-based automotive
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, a reborn Nissan Motor Co. will get deeper into a
product offensive that began in late 2001 with cars such as the
redesigned Altima and Infiniti Q45, which set industry standards for
power and performance while demonstrating that Japanese cars don't
have to look bland.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan President Carlos Ghosn, who brought the company from the
brink of insolvency in 1999 to record profitability last year, said
the company will have almost a dozen new cars and trucks for the
North American market in the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   The smaller Asian companies aren't sleeping either. Mitsubishi
Motors Corp., which saw U.S. sales rise last year despite deep image
troubles at home in Japan, plans seven new cars and trucks for the
U.S. by 2007. Ford affiliate Mazda Motor Corp. says it will launch at
least 10 new or redesigned models by 2005, including the resurrection
of the rotary engine in the uniquely styled RX-8--a four-door sports
coupe--this summer.</TE>
<TE>   When Toyota launched its Tundra pickup two years ago and
immediately topped Ford and General Motors in buyer satisfaction and
initial quality surveys for full-size pickups, it started a landslide
that is still gathering momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, while enthusiasts eagerly anticipate the release this year
of the Nissan 350Z sports coupe, the company also will introduce its
first large pickup and is expected to follow it, as did Toyota, with
a full-size SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Honda Motor Co., though not in the pickup market, is following the
phenomenal success of its Acura MDX luxury SUV with a smaller Honda
model called the Pilot. Mitsubishi is redesigning its Montero Sport,
and smaller Asian brands are looking at trucks as a way to expand
their presence.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not all trucks.</TE>
<TE>   The Asians so far have the only hybrid-propulsion cars being sold
in the U.S.: Toyota's four-door Prius and Honda's two-seat Insight
both combine small gasoline engines with electric motors to improve
fuel economy without diminishing performance. Honda this year will
add to its fleet with a hybrid version of its Civic, a move analysts
say will help bring the hybrid into the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   As the domestic auto makers are shuttering plants and furloughing
workers, Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi are planning to build
new North American plants or enlarge existing facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Even the South Koreans are getting into the act, with
Hyundai--which owns rival Kia Motors Corp.--expected to announce
plans this year for its first U.S. factory. Hyundai Motor America,
whose 2001 sales through November were up an industry-leading 41.9%,
and Kia Motors America, which was up 41.2%, recently broke ground in
Irvine for a jointly operated U.S. advanced design and engineering
facility.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. market "is being taken over by the youngest members of
the baby boom generation, the Gen-Xers and the leading edge of
Generation Y," analyst Brown said. "And those are all people who grew
up in households where import cars were acceptable, even preferred.
After all, it was the boomers who made Toyota and Honda in the '70s."</TE>
<TE>   The Europeans also came on strong in 2001, and with little help
from rebates or deeply discounted loans.</TE>
<TE>   BMW expanded sales by a vigorous 15.4% from last year's record
pace, vaulting from fourth place in 2000 to second place among luxury
brands through November, trailing only segment leader Lexus. While
European and Japanese luxury marques prospered, GM's Cadillac fell to
fourth place in the segment and Ford's Lincoln to sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Volkswagen and its Audi luxury division enjoyed another strong
year. Audi sales were up 4.3% through November, and although VW's
were down 0.7% from a robust 2000, the two brands have succeeded in
the U.S. without truck products, effectively competing in only half
the U.S. market.</TE>
