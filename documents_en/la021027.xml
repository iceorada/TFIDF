<HD>Richard Harris, Veteran British Actor, Dies at 72</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>LONDON -- Hell-raising Irishman Richard Harris, for years one of the
wild men of British acting along with Richard Burton and Peter
O'Toole, died in a London hospital on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   He had been suffering from Hodgkin's disease.</LD>
<LD>   The 72-year-old Harris, who later developed a trademark shaggy
white mane of hair, made his name with films like "Camelot," "This
Sporting Life" and "A Man Called Horse" as he carved an unmistakable
acting niche for himself.</LD>
<TE>   But like Burton and O'Toole, his fame sprang as much from his
undoubted acting talents as his hard drinking and womanizing. He was
known to go out for a pack of cigarettes and not return for two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Harris, who was married twice, told Reuters in an interview last
year: "I have made 72 movies in my life and been miscast twice -- as
a husband."</TE>
<TE>   The Limerick-born actor with a habitual twinkle in his eye
endeared himself to a new generation of fans with his role as
Professor Albus Dumbledore in last year's "Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone."</TE>
<TE>   It was a role he initially turned down, but was then nagged into
taking it on by his 11-year-old granddaughter, Emily, who threatened
never to talk to him again if he refused.</TE>
<TE>   "She called me up and said: 'Poppa, if you don't play Dumbledore,
I will never speak to you again.' I hung up and called my agent and
said I'd do it. I can't afford to lose that kid," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His family said Harris had died peacefully. Hodgkin's is a form of
lymphatic cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "With great sadness Damien, Jared and Jamie Harris announce the
death of their beloved father Richard Harris. He died peacefully at
University College Hospital," said a statement by his three children.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference earlier in the day to launch the second Harry
Potter film, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," producer
David Heyman said he and director Chris Columbus had visited Harris
in hospital and he appeared to be fighting back.</TE>
<TE>   "He did threaten to kill me if I recast [Professor Dumbledore]. I
cannot even repeat what he said. He still has got that fight inside
of him," Columbus said.</TE>
<TE>   Harris had two Oscar nominations during his film career, once for
his breakthrough 1963 supporting role as a bitter young coal miner
who becomes a professional rugby star in "This Sporting Life" and
again nearly 30 years later for his comeback role as an elderly
curmudgeon determined to hold on to his property in the 1990 drama
"The Field."</TE>
<TE>   Other film credits included the role of King Arthur in the 1967
movie adaptation of the Lerner and Loewe musical "Camelot" and the
portrayal of an English aristocrat captured and tortured by Sioux
Indians in the 1970 western "A Man Called Horse."</TE>
<TE>   Harris, whose gravelly voice made him an unlikely pop star --
despite his singing role in Camelot -- confounded his critics by
having a hit in 1968 with a recording of "MacArthur Park."</TE>

<HD>Family Dwellings Rising Near Mines</HD>
<DH>South African firms hope to reduce the spread of infectious
diseases and encourage a more stable work force by eliminating
hostels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicole Itano</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>RUSTENBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>When Zydwell Sitofe's daughter spoke her first words, he was more
than 600 miles away. Like most of South Africa's 300,000 gold and
platinum miners, he works far from home and sees his family only once
a year.</LD>
<LD>   The miners live crowded together in squalid buildings -- without
the joys of day-to-day family living -- under a system born of
colonialism and perpetuated by apartheid. But that is changing for
many men like Sitofe.</LD>
<LD>   His wife and daughter are coming to join him in a new,
pastel-colored house built by his employer, Lonmin Platinum, in an
effort to stem the spread of AIDS and create a more stable work force
by encouraging family living.</LD>
<TE>   "I am so very happy.... Now we can live together as a family,"
said Sitofe, 28, who works at a mine in Rustenburg, about 60 miles
west of Johannesburg.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with post-apartheid laws that no longer favor migrant labor
and with HIV infection rates estimated at 25% to 30% of their
workers, many South African mining companies are working to replace
crowded, all-male hostels with low-cost family housing.</TE>
<TE>   Working with local governments, they are building houses,
converting old hostels into family dwellings and offering stipends to
miners who live off company property.</TE>
<TE>   "The days when a company can decide how a man must live his life
and how his family must live their life are long gone," said Willie
Jacobsz, a spokesman for Gold Fields Ltd., South Africa's
second-largest gold company, which has several pilot projects for
family housing.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to provide cheap labor to mines, British colonial
rulers, white South Africans and mining magnates developed the
migrant labor system in the late 19th century. The racist, apartheid
government that took power in 1948 turned that system into law.</TE>
<TE>   Generations of poor black miners were forced to leave their
families at home in rural areas or in neighboring countries. They
lived in hostels, with as many as 16 jammed in a room. The hostels
were dens of alcoholism, crime and prostitution, and experts say they
spread AIDS, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases.</TE>
<TE>   "If you consider the social setting in which hundreds of thousands
of young men are removed from rural areas, living in single-sex
hostels with easy access to sex workers and to alcohol, then you
understand quite clearly one of the most important reasons for the
spread of HIV," said Dr. Mark Lurie, an investigator for the South
African Medical Research Council's migrant project.</TE>
<TE>   Although the mining industry denies that the migrant labor system
substantially contributed to the spread of AIDS, Lurie's research
found migrant mine workers were 2 1/2 times more likely to be
infected with HIV. Their wives, left at home to fend for themselves,
also had higher than average infection rates.</TE>
<TE>   The migration project estimates that converting mine hostels to
family housing could reduce HIV transmission by as much as 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Kendall, human resources manager at Lonmin Platinum, says
building family housing makes sense for the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The international trend in business is to focus on core
businesses and to stop worrying about all these extras like housing,"
he said. "With AIDS, we realized that wasn't going to work. We were
going to have to be more proactive and comprehensive in the way we
looked at this problem."</TE>
<TE>   Lonmin, praised for its housing policies, has already spent $5
million building more than 1,000 dwellings like the one Sitofe will
share with his family.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 2,000 are planned.</TE>
<TE>   Although that will affect only a small percentage of the company's
16,000 regular mine workers, Kendall says it is a start.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the positive changes, unions and AIDS researchers say few
mines have made a real commitment to ending the hostel system.</TE>
<TE>   "While the industry is starting to talk about 'Yes, this is
important,' they're not saying, 'This is important, let's change it,'
" said Moferefere Lekorotsoanoe, spokesman for the National Union of
Mineworkers. "Most of these mining houses, when you raise the issue,
they make excuses and say this is a very costly exercise."</TE>
<TE>   As some mining companies point out, building family housing is
only part of the solution. Many miners like the freedom of living
away from their families or want their families to stay in rural
areas to keep a claim on traditional land. Additionally, many mine
workers are foreigners who cannot bring their families under South
African immigration laws.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, for men like Joseph Tlontlollo, a Lonmin miner who
lives in a dark, dingy room with 12 other men, the possibility of
bringing his wife to join him gives hope.</TE>
<TE>   Six months ago, the hostel about 30 feet from Joseph's room looked
like his. Now it has family units.</TE>
<TE>   "I like them very much," Tlontlollo said, looking at the new pink
building from the concrete stoop of his room. "I will be able to
bring my family."</TE>

<HD>Robotic Exploration Yields No Solutions to Pyramid's Puzzle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Donna Bryson</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>CAIRO, Egypt</DL>
<LD>A tiny robot's exploration of the Great Pyramid has captured
imaginations around the world -- and renewed speculation about the
ideas behind the pharaoh's enigmatic monument.</LD>
<LD>   The robot's first find, broadcast live on international television
in September from the heart of the pyramid that the pharaoh Khufu
built more than 4,000 years ago, was "the hot topic the day after" on
a Web site forum for experts on ancient Egypt, said Lorelei Corcoran,
director of the Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology at the
University of Memphis.</LD>
<LD>   Opening a stone door on a treasure worthy of King Tut might have
made more compelling television, but experts say that for them, the
robot's small step was exciting.</LD>
<TE>   On TV, the robot pushed a small camera through a hole drilled in a
stone door at the end of a narrow shaft inside the pyramid, revealing
a cupboard-sized chamber. The day after the show, the robot began an
untelevised crawl through another passage with a more difficult,
zigzagging route. Several days later, it found the twin of the stone
door in the first passage.</TE>
<TE>   "I would think these additional details come only once every
generation," said Dorothea Arnold, head of the Department of Egyptian
Art at New York's Metropolitan Museum. "Isn't that something? This is
new knowledge about one of the world's masterpieces."</TE>
<TE>   Arnold said that writings from 400 to 600 years after the death of
Khufu, also known as Cheops, show that ancient Egyptologists were
already speculating about his philosophy and how it may have been
expressed in the design of his pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   "With every little detail, our thinking becomes more complex, and
in that way brings us closer to reality," Arnold said.</TE>
<TE>   The doors in the shafts -- one to the south and one to the north
-- were each 211 feet from the starting point, a room-sized chamber
within the pyramid. Both were carved of limestone to fit the
8-inch-square dimensions of the shafts. Each is adorned with what
appear to be two brass handles resembling miniature knob-handled
walking sticks.</TE>
<TE>   The symmetry, "from a philosophical point of view and from an
aesthetic point of view, is very Egyptian," said Corcoran, an art
historian who specializes in the religious beliefs of ancient
Egyptians.</TE>
<TE>   The importance placed on balance and order -- a natural reaction
then as now to the world's sometimes brutal uncertainties -- was so
great in ancient Egypt that it was personified as the goddess Maat.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes her name is translated as truth or justice, but it
really means something like harmony or balance," Corcoran said.</TE>
<TE>   The pyramid has two inner chambers -- each the starting point for
a pair of shafts -- and a third chamber underneath. The robot dubbed
the Pyramid Rover explored the two shafts leading from the lower of
the two inner chambers.</TE>
<TE>   The first door in the south shaft was discovered in 1993 by
another robot. National Geographic, working with Egypt's Supreme
Council of Antiquities, had commissioned the Boston firm iRobot to
design and build the Pyramid Rover, benefiting from the design
knowledge gained in the 1993 exploration.</TE>
<TE>   The Pyramid Rover also found what may be a third stone door
blocking the chamber found beyond the south shaft's first door. John
Taylor, assistant keeper in the British Museum's Department of
Ancient Egypt and Sudan, said the third "door" may instead be a dead
end, evidence that the lower chamber had been intended as a burial
chamber, then abandoned in favor of the higher chamber.</TE>
<TE>   Why? An engineer could have decided that the first chamber was
unstable, or a priest that it did not meet philosophical
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The shafts had long been seen by some as passages for the
pharaoh's soul, perhaps in the guise of a sun god who would emerge
from the pyramid in the morning and return in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of stone doors that also could be seen as barriers
does not necessarily undermine the theory that the shafts were
intended as passageways.</TE>
<TE>   David P. Silverman, the curator in charge of the University of
Pennsylvania Museum's Egyptian collection, said the ancient Egyptians
may have believed the pharaoh's soul had the power to pass through
such barriers, which are often found in Egyptian tombs, he said.</TE>

<HD>When Saudi Women Want Intimate Apparel, They Must Ask Men
to Help</HD>
<DH>They buy lingerie from male clerks, who often make
inappropriate comments. It is one of the few times where the sexes
aren't segregated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Donna Abu-Nasr</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia</DL>
<LD>The Saudi woman, swathed in black with only her eyes showing, held up
a lacy orange bra and asked the salesman in a whisper if he had her
size.</LD>
<LD>   "Did you say 36C?" the man replied, loudly enough for other
customers to hear. "Are you sure you don't need a bigger size?"</LD>
<LD>   "It was 36C in the past," said the woman.</LD>
<TE>   "Well, the past changes," responded the salesman.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the kind of exchange one might expect in Saudi Arabia,
where the sexes are segregated by an unwritten but stringent code.
But when it comes to lingerie, women often must discuss their most
intimate details with strange men.</TE>
<TE>   The reason is that in most stores, only men are allowed behind the
counter.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative is women-only shopping centers, of which there are
few, or self-service department stores, where the selection is
narrower.</TE>
<TE>   And once outside the house, women may only be seen as shapeless
forms under black cloaks called abayas. A visible hand, jeans-clad
leg or strand of hair can bring trouble from the muttawa, the
powerful religious police.</TE>
<TE>   At social functions such as weddings, where the sexes are
segregated in different halls, women can wear strapless evening
dresses -- but they must arrive covered up and can only reveal their
finery once they are in the women-only hall.</TE>
<TE>   The subject rouses much passion among women.</TE>
<TE>   "Society covers you up and the salesman strips you down," said
Gihan Ramadan, an online editor for Arab News daily. "It's
outrageous. Nothing could be more humiliating."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Hawwas wrote to the newspaper Al Watan
recently about accompanying his wife to a store and seeing her
"engaged in a very private conversation with a strange man about her
body measurements.... I couldn't take it and I pulled my wife out."</TE>
<TE>   Jehayeir Muassaid, a writer who has tackled this issue in Al Riyad
newspaper, was particularly incensed about a two-week book fair that
women were allowed to visit on only two half-days, closely watched by
muttawa agents.</TE>
<TE>   The reason given was that the vendors were men, Muassaid said.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes me livid is that it's OK for a woman to buy underwear
from a man who pulls and stretches each piece to show her how it can
accommodate a certain body part and then rubs it to show her how she
can wash out stains, but it's not OK for her to buy from a man a book
that would enrich her as a person," she added. "What kind of logic is
that?"</TE>
<TE>   The same logic, apparently, allows lingerie store windows to
display full-busted mannequins in skimpy underwear and sheer
nightgowns.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, a muttawa agent scolded a reporter at a mall
for not wearing a head cover. Walking behind her, he delivered a
tirade interspersed with verses from the Koran, Islam's holy book.
"Stop the defiance! Don't come to the souq uncovered!" he barked as
he strode past a lingerie store displaying a blown-up picture of a
denim bra and a mannequin dressed in a dark pink thong and matching
skimpy nightgown.</TE>
<TE>   Store windows are one thing, makeup stands another. These may not
display pictures of women's faces that promote creams, eyeshadow and
lipsticks.</TE>
<TE>   Some stands defy the ban. At one, a staffer keeps a blank sheet of
paper to cover the pictures in case the religious police show up.
Another was less lucky with the same strategy. The muttawa caught him
before he could cover the photos and ripped them up.</TE>
<TE>   A slight opening-up of the Saudi press has allowed women to air
some of their grievances, a right they did not have a few years ago.
However, there are no indications that women will be given more
freedoms, even though Saudi Arabia -- hurt by the Sept. 11 attacks in
which 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi -- seeks to repair its image
in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Muassaid said one explanation for the contradictions arising from
allowing men to sell lingerie while enforcing the rules of the abaya
is that "the rush to turn the Saudi society into a consumer society
was not matched with a drive to increase social awareness" to the
changes.</TE>
<TE>   Oil made the kingdom rich and modern in a hurry, but traditions
stayed the same and were even strengthened as a shield against what
are seen as malign Western influences.</TE>
<TE>   In the old souqs, or markets, women were -- and some still are --
allowed to sell everything from spices to household wares. But when
the modern shopping centers arrived, new rules were needed to keep
the sexes apart.</TE>
<TE>   "Since there are no civil institutions to handle such issues, the
matter was left to the muttawa, who look in one direction only,"
Muassaid said.</TE>
<TE>   She said the contradictions also reflect how few opportunities
women have for cultural enrichment.</TE>
<TE>   "When they segregated us at school, they gave us teachers, pens,
pencils, books and classes," she said. "But we have not been given
the same opportunity as men to enrich ourselves outside the school."</TE>
<TE>   At several gatherings of women in Riyadh, tips were exchanged
about avoiding lingerie embarrassment -- shop abroad, go to
self-service department stores or to women-only outlets.</TE>
<TE>   One Saudi woman, too shy to give her name, said she once took her
husband along to shop for a bra, hoping that it would cow the
salesman into minding his own business.</TE>
<TE>   "But the salesman didn't care, displaying different bra models on
the table," she said. "I was so embarrassed I just picked one in a
hurry, hoping to make a quick escape.</TE>
<TE>   "But the man didn't stop," she added. "He picked up some cups and
showed me how I could paste them onto an evening dress and assured me
they won't affect the shape of what's underneath. I was so mortified
I haven't repeated the experience."</TE>
<TE>   Muassaid said women should be allowed to work in lingerie stores
everywhere. "If they allow women to go to the souq and buy from
salesmen, why not allow women to sell?" she said.</TE>

<HD>Life of the Deceased Takes Center Stage</HD>
<DH>Themed funerals offering sets that include props, photos
and special effects gain in popularity -- especially among baby
boomers.</DH>

<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>The meat is on the grill, the sodas are on ice, and family and
friends are swapping memories about their favorite barbecue chef.</LD>
<LD>   In the hub of it all lies Uncle Harry -- in his coffin.</LD>
<LD>   Themed bereavement services, where the life of the deceased -- not
ceremony -- takes center stage, could be the future of the funeral
industry. And a Tucson company is leading the way.</LD>
<TE>   Perpetua Inc., a Tucson-based owner of funeral homes, hopes to
eventually go nationwide with its near-theater-quality sets complete
with props, photos and special effects that depict people's lives and
interests, from sports to cooking to movies.</TE>
<TE>   The personalized visitation and funeral services appeal to modern
consumers, who are used to getting what they want -- not being told
what they're going to get.</TE>
<TE>   Slivy Edmonds Cotton, Perpetua's chairman and chief executive,
first learned of the fledgling concept through an industry
association. She knew immediately that she'd found a new direction
for her company, which owns four Midwest and East Coast funeral
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'OK, this is my calling -- to change the face of
funeral services in the United States,' " she said. "That's a pretty
grand statement, but really, that's what we feel we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   The concept is taking off fast. One Perpetua funeral home in St.
Louis started offering themed funerals a year ago. Already, they are
the choice of nearly half of the clientele.</TE>
<TE>   Themed services provide not only a more comfortable, homelike
environment, but something for visitors to talk about in a usually
tongue-tied situation, Edmonds Cotton said.</TE>
<TE>   "When they come into these sets, they immediately have something
to say to the family. They say, 'Oh my goodness, this is just like
him,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   The sets also bring out fond recollections.</TE>
<TE>   "I started having real good memories, and it wasn't just like
boo-hooing and crying," said Angela Clay Harris of St. Louis, who
chose the "Big Momma's Kitchen" set for visitation services for her
mother.</TE>
<TE>   Family and friends, surrounded by familiar appliances, even played
cards at the kitchen table during the visitation.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers, particularly baby boomers, are driving this new demand
for more personalized funeral services, said Joseph Budzinski,
internal chief operating officer for the International Cemetery and
Funeral Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "In years past, there was a more rigid selection of choices,"
Budzinski said. "Today, people want to play more of a role."</TE>
<TE>   Themed funerals are steering people back toward longer, more
elaborate, more meaningful ceremonies that do what funerals are
designed to do: start the grieving process and memorialize someone.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Bring, president of Bring Funeral Home Inc. in Tucson, said
the trend toward more personal funerals is happening even without
detailed sets. Services at Bring regularly include photographs and
mementos of the person being remembered, and have featured golf
clubs, motorcycles, old cars in the parking lot and even a service at
someone's home where the casket was placed on hay bales.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral homes' ability to do more, including themed funerals,
depends on many things, including space, time and resources. If two
families are using the funeral home on the same day, their services
could clash: Not everyone is going to like the idea of barbecue
permeating the air.</TE>
<TE>   When her husband died June 1, Margaret Cosey of St. Peters, Mo.,
opted for a backyard barbecue scene for his visitation.</TE>
<TE>   "His mother is from down South, so I was worried about how she
would react to it," said Cosey, who was married to Lourenzy Cosey for
39 years.</TE>
<TE>   She needn't have worried.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me it was beautiful," Cosey said. "All the elderly
people told me it was beautiful. It relaxed them."</TE>
<TE>   Wade Funeral Home branch manager Aaron Grimes, known among
staffers as "Mr. Disney" for his knack with theatrical devices, used
dry ice to mimic barbecue smoke, and cooked food in a microwave
throughout the service to keep the barbecue aroma fresh.</TE>
<TE>   Many people use one of the three stock vignettes that Wade Funeral
Home has on hand -- Big Momma's Kitchen, a sports set or a Victorian
parlor -- but Grimes also designs entirely new sets for services.
Often, employees bring in items from their own homes to lend to the
sets.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time, the family doesn't know what we're going to
come up with," he said. "I got a tremendous imagination. I just come
up with all kinds of things."</TE>
<TE>   Perpetua doesn't charge extra for themed services, but it does get
"repeat business" from people who attend and ask for the same kind of
services for themselves, or for someone they know who has died.</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of Wade Funeral Homes' clients choose the vignettes,
which the company premiered in June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral homes that want to keep afloat will follow suit, said Joe
Weigel, spokesman for Batesville Casket Co. of Batesville, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Kettler of Tucson, who owns a small business and works for
a local small-business advocacy group, said she likes the idea of
practically anything other than a traditional funeral, with dim
lights, somber music and weeping mourners.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, the theme would be barefoot, sand, saxophone player,
sunshine, umbrellas to sit underneath for people who don't like the
sun," said Kettler, 49. "I want the celebration of my life to be a
celebration of my life, not the sadness of my passing, because
passing is a part of life."</TE>

<HD>For a Good Scare, Turn to 'Hauntrepreneurs'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Colleen Long</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>GREELEY, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Inside the concrete walls of Distortions Unlimited, blood is spilled,
decomposed bodies are wrapped in plastic and green ghoulish figures
stare in horror.</LD>
<LD>   Company owners Ed and Marsha Edmunds don't get scared very often.
Good thing, because they are among the top "hauntrepreneurs" in the
nation, manufacturing masks, creepy animatronics and frightening set
displays for haunted houses and amusement parks worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   They also fashioned props and sets for Alice Cooper's current
tour. Cooper personal manager Toby Mamis said Distortions' creations
fit perfectly with the creepy and theatrical nature of the shock
rocker's shows.</LD>
<TE>   "We met them during their brutal planet attraction, and it was one
of the scariest things we'd ever seen," Mamis said, referring to a
1997 show that Distortions presented. "And it's got to be scary to
scare Alice."</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds started out making masks as a University of Northern
Colorado undergraduate in the 1970s. The privately owned company grew
from his love of scary movies, "Tales From the Crypt" comic books and
the TV show "The Outer Limits."</TE>
<TE>   When Morris Costumes picked up his line of masks around 1980, he
could afford to do more creative work.</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds, 47, will not reveal revenue figures, but said they were
in the millions per year. Marsha Taub Edmunds got involved after the
two met in college and married.</TE>
<TE>   In the far corner of the 24,000-square-foot Distortions warehouse,
welders put finishing touches on a fake electric chair that brutally
jerks a life-size dummy with a black hood over its head. Nearby,
workers crate a pale, life-size mannequin strapped to a table, its
lower half hacked to the bone and fake blood spewing from its wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Snaking around the cluttered warehouse is an assembly line for
hundreds of claw hands. Piles of unpainted rubber masks and body
parts litter the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly don't know what it is about severed heads and
blood-spewing creatures, but people sure love a little gore," Edmunds
said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, it's getting harder and harder to scare children.
"With the advent of HBO and kids seeing $50 million in special
effects in science fiction movies, it's taking really dramatic stuff
to make an impression," he said. "We're working hard to break new
ground."</TE>
<TE>   His newest idea, "The Beast," is a creature 150 feet long and 25
feet high. People literally walk into the mouth, past internal organs
and half-chewed victims. It comes complete with sound effects of
gross bodily functions. Edmunds plans to preview it at a November
trade show for theme park owners in Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Haunted house owner Nick Trahanas says Edmunds is a household name
among "hauntrepreneurs."</TE>
<TE>   Trahanas owns a spooky ride and two haunted houses at the historic
Rye Playland in Rye, N.Y. Edmunds helped him renovate the ride with
zombies, gory scenes of guillotines lopping off heads and animated
creatures that move when patrons pass.</TE>
<TE>   "There's really no one doing what Ed is doing," Trahanas said.
"He's got quite a niche."</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds and his employees come up with ideas for the creatures and
do most of the assembly at the warehouse using latex, silicon and
metals.</TE>
<TE>   Prices vary from $12.95 for a pair of alien rubber hands to $6,889
for a life-size electric chair and a $22,000 animated sleeping giant
that screams and sits up when people walk past. Distortions sells its
products online.</TE>
<TE>   Halloween is becoming more popular and haunted house budgets are
increasing. The National Retail Assn. said Halloween revenues are
second only to Christmas when it comes to decorations. An estimated
$6.9 billion will be spent this year on costumes, candy and
decorations, association spokeswoman Ellen Tolley said.</TE>
<TE>   She said consumers spend more because the holiday is becoming more
than just one night, with haunted houses and fright festivals lasting
all month.</TE>
<TE>   There are some things Edmunds will not do. His life-size electric
chairs and guillotines are wildly popular, and he's expecting to sell
more than 100 torture devices this year. But he refuses to make
likenesses of real killers like Osama bin Laden or Timothy McVeigh.</TE>
<TE>   "What we make here is so fantastical and so phony, I don't want to
deal with that actual evil," Edmunds said.</TE>

<HD>Dying Father Struggles to Say Goodbye</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helen O'Neill</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW HAVEN, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Editor's Note: A reporter chronicled the lives of a dying single
father and his four children for six months as he prepared them for
how life would be when he is gone.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- The children tumble in from school, all
breathless excitement and questions.</LD>
<TE>   "Daddy, can we go to the store?" "Daddy, can I call my friend?"
"Daddy, can we go to the park?"</TE>
<TE>   It's late spring, and for a moment, Felix Del Valle forgets his
disease, his tormented body, his impending death.</TE>
<TE>   Slumped in his wheelchair, he beams, shaking his head at the
blessing of being home another day.</TE>
<TE>   He knows what the world sees: a 46-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's
disease, a man whose legs and arms don't work anymore, a man with no
money and no means of support, a man who will not witness the future
of the four children he has raised alone.</TE>
<TE>   His kids don't understand the shadow of death like adults do, not
even his oldest, 11-year-old Kyia, who feeds him and wheels him and
shaves him and fakes his signature to cash his welfare checks.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes Felix wonders: Will she learn to be a child again when I
am gone?</TE>
<TE>   But what no one understands, not his children nor his friends, not
the stream of well-intentioned social workers and volunteers, is that
it's not dying that is breaking Felix's heart.</TE>
<TE>   It is the decision he must make by summer's end, to hand over Kyia
and Janet, 10, and Felix Jr., 8, and Crystal, 6, to the kindhearted
family that has offered to adopt them.</TE>
<TE>   Felix is grateful beyond words that his children will be raised
together after he dies.</TE>
<TE>   But he dreads the day they can no longer live as a family in their
little apartment on Day Street, when his children move on to their
new life and he moves into a nursing home to die.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a life that hasn't been marked by much luck, the happy moments
shine: The day in January 2000 when Felix won sole custody of his
children from their abusive, drug-addicted mother.</TE>
<TE>   The day Lori Burgess offered to become a mother to his children
when he succumbs.</TE>
<TE>   It was October 2001, the day after Felix had been told he had an
incurable disease that would eat away at his muscles and nerves and
kill him within two years.</TE>
<TE>   He stumbled back to work in a daze of disbelief, his mind frozen
by one thought: What will happen to my children?</TE>
<TE>   Like everyone in the Long Wharf office complex, Burgess, an
administrator with the Visiting Nurse Assn., knew Felix as the
ever-smiling sandwich man, whose cries of, "Hello, gorgeous!" made
all the ladies blush.</TE>
<TE>   And so when Lori saw Felix's face contorted in sadness and fear,
she sat right down and asked him what was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Through tears, Felix told her about his death sentence, about his
biggest fear -- that his children would be sent to foster homes, that
the family he had struggled to keep together would be torn apart.</TE>
<TE>   But where would he find someone to take on four children?</TE>
<TE>   That night, Lori talked to her husband, David, a minister, and
their children, David Jr., 14, Jelisa, 11, and Zachary, 5.</TE>
<TE>   What if we opened our home to these children? they asked. What if
they become part of our family forever?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Daddy is so happy," Kyia says, beaming, as she feeds Felix
mouthfuls of hamburger in his wheelchair at home. "Because he knows
that when he is in heaven, we will be with a good family, with our
very own mommy and daddy."</TE>
<TE>   Their father turns away so she won't see his tears.</TE>
<TE>   It is early June, eight months after his conversation with Lori,
and he is still overwhelmed with gratitude. But the transition is
proving harder than he imagined.</TE>
<TE>   At first he and Lori were feted like heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Churches and schools and businesses threw fund-raisers, setting up
a fund for his children and another for the Burgesses to buy a bigger
home. A Yale law professor took on Felix's legal case, working out an
agreement for the long-term guardianship of the children. There was
even a weeklong trip to Walt Disney World in December.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd never seen my children so happy," Felix said.</TE>
<TE>   But it's a cruel kind of happiness for a father to witness his
children's delight and know it is connected to his death.</TE>
<TE>   Felix does the best he can, talking to them while he still has his
voice, telling them about his life -- growing up in a home for
abandoned children in New York City, the basketball exploits that won
him a college scholarship, the times he collected cans to make ends
meet.</TE>
<TE>   "You must love each other," he tells them. "And you must always
stay together."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes they don't want to hear about his dying. Sometimes they
taunt him. Sometimes they cry. Mostly they just adore him.</TE>
<TE>   Kyia is the little mother-figure who wheedles her father to eat
more, scolds him when he gets depressed, and coaxes laughs from him
with her crazy dancing and silly smiles.</TE>
<TE>   Felix Jr. is a gentle son, always hugging his dad, and sometimes
begging him to live for another 1,000 years. Little Crystal just
beams at the world with her lopsided grin.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is Janet -- lanky, rebellious Janet who bristles
with confusion and hurt and fear. At 10, she has no idea where to put
all her emotions or how to control them.</TE>
<TE>   "I worry about all of them," Felix says. "But I worry most about
Janet."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lori's mother, Peggy, jokes that even as a child her daughter was
a magnet for the wounded and the lonely.</TE>
<TE>   If anyone can take on another four children, Peggy says, it is
this couple, high school sweethearts who stayed in the town where
they grew up, close to a huge network of family and friends, and to
the Union Temple church that is their spiritual home.</TE>
<TE>   The Burgesses shrug off the wonder of friends. It's not a
sacrifice, they say. It's a joy.</TE>
<TE>   The children make it easy.</TE>
<TE>   Their first meeting -- a Halloween party a year ago -- was such a
success that the little ones cried when they parted.</TE>
<TE>   Kyia and Jelisa acted as if they had been sisters all their lives,
braiding their hair, painting their nails and excitedly planning how
to decorate their bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   David Jr. took on the task of teaching little Felix how to throw a
football and other "manly" activities.</TE>
<TE>   Only Janet seemed unsure of her place in this strange new world.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-July, Janet throws a tantrum that, even by her standards,
is out of control. Screaming, raging, crying, flinging keys at Kyia
and an iron at Crystal.</TE>
<TE>   Felix despairs. He asks Kyia to dial the crisis number the social
worker has given him.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't take care of her anymore," he sobs.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, Janet is in the children's psychiatric unit of
St. Raphael's hospital, clinging to her father as a counselor
explains that she needs to be away from her family for a while.</TE>
<TE>   Felix knows that it is probably the first of many visits.</TE>
<TE>   There are times when Felix wonders if his illness was all part of
God's plan -- to give his children a better life.</TE>
<TE>   There are times when he wonders if it would be better to die
quickly, in a car crash, or a plane crash. Then he thinks of the
fathers who died on Sept. 11. And he feels lucky he has time to say
goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   But planning the final farewell gets harder.</TE>
<TE>   He arranges for the children to be baptized so each will have
godparents -- another set of protectors when he is gone.</TE>
<TE>   But he cannot bring himself to part with them at the end of
summer, as agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Soon," Felix whispers. "I just need a little more time."</TE>
<TE>   But time is running out. The disease is now attacking his lungs.
Even the children can see him slipping away.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 20, the state Department of Children and Family Services
intervenes. The children are picked up after school and brought to
the Burgesses.</TE>
<TE>   Felix is left alone with a piece of paper that says he is too sick
to take care of his children.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 10. The Burgess home is more beautiful than he imagined --
like a storybook house with its pale blue walls and dark blue trim.
Inside, a fire glows in the hearth and a pot bubbles on the stove.</TE>
<TE>   The children tumble into his arms, Crystal waving her sparkling
new slippers, Felix Jr. smothering him with hugs, Kyia dancing a
silly dance and singing a silly song.</TE>
<TE>   They are happy and excited. And they are home.</TE>
<TE>   Felix is overwhelmed. His eyes fill, but he doesn't cry.</TE>
<TE>   He still worries about Janet, who is back in the hospital and who
is being sent to a home for troubled children when she gets out.</TE>
<TE>   But he no longer feels so sad.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in his wheelchair in this warm, noisy house with the
couple who will become his children's parents, he feels happy. And
sure.</TE>
<TE>   "They are in the right place," Felix says, as a friend drives him
away.</TE>

<LD>Researchers have spotted a likely new reason for bone loss that
afflicts women and teenage girls who exercise so much or eat so
little that they wind up starving themselves.</LD>
<LD>   The focus is on the appetite hormone leptin, which is produced by
fat cells and influences brain chemistry that regulates appetite.
When fat cells are plump, leptin levels are high. When fat cells are
lean, leptin levels are low.</LD>
<LD>   But scientists believe leptin's role gets more complicated in
people who eat far less than they require for normal metabolism. In
these cases, the body reduces activities that are not vital, and
building bone is among them.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers say very low leptin levels prevent bone cells from
doing their normal job of building mineral in bone. "The bone goes to
sleep," said Dr. Michelle P. Warren of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center in New York City. "It's almost a hibernation, to conserve
energy."</TE>
<TE>   Warren and colleagues at Columbia-Presbyterian reviewed research,
including her own, in the October issue of a medical journal, The
Physician and Sportsmedicine.</TE>
<TE>   They focused on girls and women whose energy deficit can lead to a
exercise-associated amenorrhea -- the loss of regular monthly
periods. Over time, women with this condition can lose bone, setting
them up for increasingly fragile bones, including osteoporosis, as
they age.</TE>
<TE>   A low-calorie, high-energy-output imbalance can happen because of
the demands of physical activities -- thinness is a valued
characteristic in gymnasts and ballet dancers, for instance. It also
can happen to those with anorexia, the compulsion to be thin.</TE>
<TE>   "Low leptin levels have been reported in amenorrheic women who
exercise regularly at high levels," the journal said.</TE>
<TE>   Previous research had focused on estrogen, which declines in
amenorrheic females. That was partly blamed for the shutdown of the
reproductive system and loss of bone.</TE>
<TE>   The new research indicates it's not so simple. Estrogen and leptin
seem to have different ways of doing damage, Warren said.</TE>
<TE>   While leptin loss retards new bone-building, estrogen loss seems
to take the brakes off other cells, called osteoclasts, which strip
out old bone mineral, Warren said. The result would be double the
bone vulnerability -- growth is inhibited and loss is accelerated.</TE>
<TE>   Exercising this much also reverses what would otherwise be a
healthy trend. "Physical activity is important in maintaining bone
mass; however, many women tend to exercise excessively, causing
hormonal changes that predispose them to an increased risk of
fractures," the journal article said.</TE>
<TE>   Warren said the leptin link is worthy of further study. But
scientists say there is no sign now that leptin supplements would
solve the bone-loss problem.</TE>
<TE>   It's also too soon for doctors to use leptin levels as an early
warning sign of inadequate bone mass, said Dr. Carol Otis of
Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic in Los Angeles, who did not work on
the review article. Leptin is more properly "a marker of inadequate
nutrition and weight loss," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And even use of low leptin levels as an indicator of
calorie-balance problems could be misleading, Otis said. Leptin
levels vary during the day, so several blood samples would be
required, and normal reference levels of leptin in the blood have not
been determined, she said.</TE>

<HD>Women Increase Stake in Small New England Farms</HD>
<DH>Six states in region are among the top 15 in the United
States in female-run operations. Many are stepping out from
supporting roles.</DH>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>CHESTER, Vt</DL>
<LD>CHESTER, Vt. -- When Lisa Kaiman began pursuing her dream of opening
a small dairy farm, she didn't get much encouragement.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Kaiman, who first milked cows when she thought she might
become a veterinarian, was determined to make it work. The Princeton,
N.J., native spent eight years working on other people's farms,
studying what she liked and didn't like. She bought an old farmhouse
without running water or electricity and started remodeling.</LD>
<LD>   In 1999, she officially opened her solo operation, Jersey Girls
Dairy, a farm in Chester dedicated to providing her registered
Jerseys with a comfortable life.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't even tell you how many people told me it can't be done,
you can't do it," said Kaiman, 35, who now milks two dozen Jerseys.
"Which actually is really good because I'm stubborn as a mule, and
the best way to get me to do something is tell me I can't do it."</TE>
<TE>   She is one of a growing group of New England women who have been
changing a traditional stereotype. Six states in the region are among
the top 15 in percentage of female-run farms, according to the most
recent U.S. Department of Agriculture survey, completed five years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 was New Hampshire, with 17.6%; No. 4, Massachusetts, 16.6%;
No. 5, Rhode Island, 15.7%; No. 7, Connecticut, 15%; No. 11, Maine,
14.1%; No. 14, Vermont, 13.4%.</TE>
<TE>   In the decade that ended in 1997, as the proportion of female-run
farms nationally rose 37%, Maine saw a 57% increase and New Hampshire
39%.</TE>
<TE>   Getting started in agriculture may be easier for women in New
England because the region's farms tend to be smaller, according to
Vivianne Holmes with the Women's Agricultural Network in Lisbon
Falls, Maine, which provides workshops and other support services to
farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "Our regular traditional farms are small here in New England, and
so if women tend to want to stay small, want to stay out of debt,
want to be able to handle the whole process themselves ... it's less
burdensome, it's less frightening to get into it than it would [be]
out West, where you're talking thousands of acres," said Holmes, who
has her own farm with small livestock, pigs and chickens.</TE>
<TE>   Experts believe the figures underestimate the role women are
playing because they don't account for farms that women run jointly
with their husbands.</TE>
<TE>   "Women really are silent partners in a lot of farms where they
don't get a lot of credit," said Mary Peabody, director of the
Women's Agricultural Network in Berlin, Vt.</TE>
<TE>   They're now stepping out of supporting roles in increasing
numbers, Peabody said.</TE>
<TE>   "Women have money now that they haven't had in past generations
that they're able to invest in their business," she said. "They have
access to education; more and more young women every year are going
through and getting college educations in animal sciences, and plant
and soil sciences."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Mayo, 53, started Arbutus Hill Farm in Meredith, N.H.,
about eight years ago. She'd earned a master's degree in
environmental resource management and knew she wanted to live and
work off the land.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a female farmer, I think you have to accept the fact
that it is not the norm," said Mayo, whose 50-acre farm sells pork,
lamb and organic vegetables. "A lot of the farming community is very
traditional, and if you're a woman without a mate, I think it's even
harder."</TE>
<TE>   Mayo started the Beginner Farmers of New Hampshire, a group with
three-fourths female membership, to help new farmers network with one
another.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a process, and you just have to be patient and just
keep reassuring people that you really are serious and you have some
very specific goals, and you keep plugging away and you don't let
anyone discourage you," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some farmers like Martha Izzi entered into agriculture after long
careers in other areas. Izzi, 63, a former federal employee, began
keeping animals on her Shrewsbury, Vt., farm in 1986 and initially
commuted every weekend from Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Izzi has taken to farming in a serious way. She now lives there
full-time and raises sheep, goats and chickens, alongside her
husband, a horticulturist.</TE>
<TE>   "We both have found our callings in some ways," Izzi said.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor contributing to the rise in female-run farms is
simple demographics. "As the average age of farmers increases, just
by virtue of the fact that women live longer than men, women will
inherit a substantial amount of farmland that they're responsible for
being the decision makers for," Peabody said.</TE>
<TE>   Operators like Rosina Wallace, 55, of Waterbury, Vt., are running
the farms on which they were reared. She first worked as a teacher
before returning in 1980 to the farm that her family has run for five
generations. Fifteen years later, she became its primary operator
after her father's death.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Wallace doesn't consider herself much of a phenomenon.
After all, her paternal grandmother took over the family farm she now
runs after her grandfather died. And she was rearing seven children.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go back to the history all across the country, whenever
the men have had to do something else, the women have risen to the
occasion," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Female operators can face challenges that differ from those of
men. "Women are very averse to taking on debt, and starting a
business is a very risky proposition," Peabody said. "And I think
women sometimes tend to un- dercapitalize their businesses, and tend
to try to stay at a very sort of home-based business level. That
becomes challenging in terms of the competition that they're facing."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace hires a mechanic to repair her equipment, and relies on
help with baling hay and other tasks she says her father once did
himself.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the obstacles are the ones confronting many small farm
operations. For example, with a downturn in milk prices, Kaiman has
had to sell animals to buy winter feed this year.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to meet too many farmers right now that don't
need another source of income," said Kaiman, who supplements her farm
income by doing accounting work for small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even with the economic uncertainties of farming, Wallace
says she wouldn't trade her problems for anyone else's. "I'm just
where I want to be, and I just love being here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   If she had to, her education would allow her to work elsewhere,
but that thought is hard to consider. "I wouldn't be here, watching
the change from morning to night, and from day to day and from season
to season," she said. "And I wouldn't be a part of that, absorbing it
and hearing it and smelling it. To me, that's just what's so neat
about what I do."</TE>

<HD>Footwear Industry Steps Up to Meet Needs of Baby Boomers</HD>
<DH>No longer willing to suffer to be fashionable, aging
customers are seeking both comfort and style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne D'Innocenzio</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Until last spring, Linda Mann was willing to squeeze her size 9 foot
-- bunions and all -- into the latest trendy footwear just to impress
her clients or dates.</LD>
<LD>   But the 54-year-old public relations executive vows never again,
after she fell flat on her face and broke bones in her left foot
while making a getaway on wobbly heels from a bad blind date.</LD>
<LD>   "I was on my cell phone to my daughter complaining about my date,
and I fell on a crack," said Mann, of Manhattan. "I was in such pain,
and couldn't walk. I can't live with the stress of knowing I can
fall. At the same time, I don't want to wear shoes that make me look
like a dork."</LD>
<TE>   The footwear industry is waking up to the growing demands of Mann
and other baby boomers who have been slaves to the styles of the
decades -- from platform shoes to stiletto heels -- but who no longer
are willing to suffer in the name of fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Boomers still want stylish footwear, but now, with aging feet,
they're looking for more comfortable shoes without having them look
orthopedic.</TE>
<TE>   Major retailers such as Proffitt's, Nordstrom, Macy's and J.C.
Penney are all responding by stocking up on wider widths and bigger
sizes or working with suppliers to add more cushioning for the 38 to
56 age group.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Penney created a "comfort zone" in its women's shoe
departments, featuring brands such as Clarks and Rockport. It will be
launching similar departments for men later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, brands such as Naturalizer and Easy Spirit -- known for
their extra cushioning and flexible soles -- are overhauling their
dowdy images by offering such youthful styles as mules and platforms.</TE>
<TE>   Shoe designer Stuart Weitzman has added wider sizes and used foam
in all of his shoes, including strappy sandals. And two years ago,
upscale footwear brand Cole Haan began incorporating tiny air bags
into some of its shoes, using its parent Nike Inc.'s technology.</TE>
<TE>   New shoe companies catering to boomers have formed as well,
including Taryn Rose International LLC, started by an orthopedic
surgeon. The women's and men's shoe line, sold at high-end stores and
featuring lambskin and stretch materials, is priced at $325 and up.</TE>
<TE>   Still, while there's an effort to offer more comfort, the latest
shoe trends -- long, skinny, pointed shoes, ankle straps, and
curved-in heels from the likes of such trendsetters as Jimmy Choo --
signal that enduring pain is still a must for being a fashionista.</TE>
<TE>   "At the same time the industry is offering healthy shoes, it's
also offering higher heels and more unhealthy styles," said Dr. Glenn
Pfeffer, a San Francisco-based orthopedic surgeon who is on the board
of the American Academy of the Orthopedic Surgeons. "I am
anticipating a boom in business in [foot] surgery."</TE>
<TE>   After age 40, stiffness in the Achilles tendon, which connects the
calf muscles to the heel bone, sets in. Soles of the feet lose fat
cells, giving boomers less cushion for walking. Aging adults also
will find their feet getting larger as ligaments stretch out, Pfeffer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pfeffer believes boomers have more difficult foot problems than
senior citizens because they are the ones leading more active lives,
commuting to work and busy running around with children.</TE>
<TE>   Still, marketing to this generation is tricky because boomers
don't want to feel old.</TE>
<TE>   Candace Corlett, a marketing consultant, said brands such as Easy
Spirit and Naturalizer still have an uphill battle to appeal to this
audience. "They're still identified with old feet," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Naturalizer has seen the average age of its customer drop 24
years, to age 40, since 1998, said Brad Adams, senior vice president
of Naturalizer's retail division, a division of Brown Shoe Co.</TE>

<HD>Amtrak Increases Patrols After Terrorist Warning</HD>
<DH>FBI issues advisory after Al Qaeda prisoners reveal that
U.S. passenger trains, stations, bridges and tracks may be targeted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Amtrak is increasing patrols of its trains and stations because of an
FBI warning about a possible Al Qaeda attack soon against passenger
railroads.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the warning, based on information obtained from Al
Qaeda prisoners in mid-October, suggested that terrorists may try to
destroy bridges or key sections of track.</LD>
<LD>   "The group has considered directly targeting U.S. passenger
trains, possibly using operatives who have a Western appearance," the
FBI said Thursday in a statement that was issued to state and local
law enforcement agencies.</LD>
<TE>   Captured Al Qaeda photographs of U.S. railroad engines, cars and
crossings raised concern about the threat, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   The warning is the second this month. On Oct. 9, the FBI and
several federal agencies overseeing high-risk sectors such as
transportation, energy and agriculture sent warnings urging extra
precautions.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Johndroe, Homeland Security spokesman, said the agency is
coordinating efforts to tighten security with the Department of
Transportation and other federal agencies, as well as the private
sector, and state and local governments.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people should still ride our nation's rails and know
that this warning has been provided to state and local law
enforcement, and the appropriate security officials, so they can take
the appropriate steps to increase protective measures," Johndroe
said.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak President David Gunn said federal transportation officials
told him about the warning.</TE>
<TE>   "The threat, like a lot of others, is not specific," Gunn said.</TE>
<TE>   The passenger railroad is taking steps to enhance security, Gunn
said, although he declined to describe them except to say riders
won't notice them.</TE>
<TE>   Around the Sept. 11 anniversary, Amtrak announced that it intended
to enforce tighter identification requirements, including random ID
checks of passengers on trains.</TE>
<TE>   But Amtrak decided to reconsider that plan and has never
implemented it.</TE>
<TE>   New York Gov. George Pataki said his office had contacted the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the port authority and local
law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "We are vigilant in protecting public services and infrastructure
points across this state," Pataki said, adding that there was no
specific threat against New York.</TE>
<TE>   Edward R. Hamberger, president of the Assn. of American Railroads,
said that in the past year, railroads developed a security plan that
includes a round-the-clock operations center linking railroad control
centers with law enforcement agencies and increased surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   "The nation's railroads will not be a soft target for terrorists,"
Hamberger said.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials continue to believe that Al Qaeda plans to
attack other symbols of U.S. economic interests, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence has learned from additional Al Qaeda prisoners
that the terrorist group may be planning strikes on oil tankers as
part of an attack on the global petroleum industry, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   "Such attacks may be a part of more extensive operations against
port facilities and other energy-related targets, including oil
facilities and nuclear power plants," the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists believed linked to Al Qaeda attacked a French oil
tanker off the coast of Yemen earlier this month.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sara Rosario Gonzalez is a 32-year-old restorer of rare books at the
Getty Museum in Los Angeles who unexpectedly finds herself on the
verge of a heartbreak, but as Yxta Maya Murray shows in her latest
novel, "The Conquest," the human yearning to overcome loss can
sometimes be the inspiration that leads to great art.</LD>
<LD>   When Sara's high school sweetheart, Marine Capt. Karl Sullivan,
announces his engagement to another woman and wants Sara to let go of
him, she lures him back into her bed by doing what she does best:
Like Scheherazade, she reveals to him piecemeal the content of a
manuscript she's working on: the saga of a female Aztec juggler
abducted to Europe in 1528 by Hernan Cortes after he overthrew the
Aztec empire and won Mexico for the Spanish crown.</LD>
<LD>   The untitled folio, which Sara calls "The Conquest," is more than
a gambit for Karl's affection. It becomes Sara's attempt to give a
voice to her ancestors and to all brown women; in the process, she
will rediscover her own mestiza identity and confront the
transgressions of the Old World upon the New. But first, there is
something of a mystery to be worked out concerning the authorship of
the manuscript.</LD>
<TE>   From her first novel, "Locas," to "What It Takes to Get to Vegas,"
Murray has taken a major step as a writer in "The Conquest," creating
a hybrid garden of literary intricacies that might have amused even
Jorge Luis Borges. Not coincidentally, at one point in the story Sara
impulsively decides to spend money saved for a wedding ring on an
autographed first edition of Borges' "The Garden of Forking Paths."
While interweaving a modern romance with a 16th century adventure
story, "The Conquest" explores one of Borges' favorite themes: that
reading is really an alternative form of writing, because when we
read, we inevitably rewrite the text and become its true author.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Sara will find her life irreversibly changed by
reading, discovering in a book written four centuries earlier clues
to her own existence and to the mysteries that rule her life. What
does she really feel for Karl? What is her place as a Latina in the
U.S.? And, most intriguingly, who is the real author of "The
Conquest"?</TE>
<TE>   Most experts agree that the manuscript was written by Padre Miguel
de Pasamonte, a hedonistic Hieronymite monk known for riotous novels,
but in Sara's impassioned reading, this book must have been conceived
not by Pasamonte but by an Aztec woman, perhaps the juggler herself,
even though there is no proof that she existed. True to her Mexican
blood, Sara is out to make the fictitious more real than reality as
she embarks on a mission to resuscitate the enigmatic Aztec woman
(whom we only know by her converted name, Helen) through her inner
compass and bibliographic research.</TE>
<TE>   Helen is the daughter of Tlacaelel, a fierce aristocratic patriot
who believes no injustice should ever go unpunished. His final
mandate to his daughter was to find and kill "the savages' king" in
revenge for the crimes brought about by the Spanish conquest of
Mexico. With the aid of her intelligence, exoticness, insatiable
curiosity and juggling talent, Helen takes it upon herself to
assassinate the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, in whose name Cortes
acted. Her journey of revenge begins at the Vatican, where Helen
meets Caterina, the nun in charge of converting her. And convert her
she does, to the raptures of Eros and the wisdom of banned books in a
society in which "literacy did not bode well for the soundness of the
mind nor womb."</TE>
<TE>   Helen's flamboyant and labyrinthine adventures take us from the
corruption of Rome to Titian's lustful Venice, the alluring depths of
lesbian love, the beginning of the end of Charles V's hold on the
Ottoman Empire, Helen's years as an ascetic juggler in Barbarossa's
Al-Jazirah, and the reunion in Rome with her true love, Caterina, who
has been persecuted by the Inquisition for her unspeakable
blasphemies. At long last, there is the confrontation with the dying
Charles V in a cloister in southern Spain, in which Helen grants the
emperor what he and the conquest would never bestow on her people or
her father, namely, mercy. Christian mercy, one could even say, as
sublimated by a heathen Aztec woman.</TE>
<TE>   The journey has mixed results. The more Murray delves into the
specificity of Latin American culture, the more she discovers values
with which many of her readers will identify. However, when it comes
to expressing those values in a universal context, "The Conquest" is
somewhat uneven, as the author seems more comfortable and persuasive
in bringing to life contemporary Los Angeles than 16th century
Europe. At times, the novel contains brilliant premises that are not
executed in a satisfying way.</TE>
<TE>   So where does Helen end and Sara begin? The events in Helen's saga
are as influenced by Sara's story as they in turn influence the
developments in Sara's life. Sara grew up trying to reconcile the
different attitudes that her parents had about Mexican ancestry and
their condition as immigrants. Her mother, Beatrice, once tried to
steal an Aztec codex from a Long Beach museum in order to right a
wrong. Reynaldo's legacy for his daughter is the dream of many
immigrants: American society is Sara's birthright, for which her
father went through purgatory. Sara concludes that her parents were
talking about the same thing but calling it by different names: the
pursuit of dignity and equality consistent with the role that Mexican
American culture has played in the United States, both as a work
force and as a creative voice.</TE>
<TE>   "The Conquest" tackles the excruciating question of how to redress
loss, whether it be in the form of a 500-year-old conquest that has
deprived the indigenous people of the universe as they knew it, the
loss of a lover or the gradual erosion of one's cultural identity in
the modern world. Murray suggests that in order to seek answers one
must take an active role in forging one's destiny. Both Sara and
Helen make choices and take actions that sacrifice pride and comfort;
they defy conventions, redefine their own expectations of themselves
and in the end, not unlike "The Conquest," transcend their own
limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Sara's greatest conquest -- in Murray's hands -- is that,
by acknowledging the complex nature of her roots, she learns to see
herself not as a displaced Latina in Los Angeles but as an integral
human being in charge of her destiny, one rich in possibilities and
choices rising from the shadows of buried, palpitating memories.</TE>

<AU>Frank Clifford</AU>
<BD>Frank Clifford is the author of "The Backbone of the
World: A Portrait of the Vanishing West Along the Continental
Divide." He is an editor at The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The West is an exquisite corpse. "There was nothing to see in the
land in the way of a flower," remarked Georgia O'Keeffe when she
first saw the high desert of northern New Mexico. "There were just
dry white bones."</LD>
<LD>   A cow's skull floating in the sky became the painter's most
enduring image. But there was nothing ethereal about the boneyard. It
was the ruinous outcome of Depression-era drought, made all the more
lethal by overstocking and overgrazing an arid land.</LD>
<LD>   The hard surfaces and lifeless spaces have always made it
difficult to appreciate the fragility of the West. We are
desensitized by its lunar complexion and its otherworldliness. We
named the landmarks of the Grand Canyon after alien deities:
Jupiter's Temple and Vulcan's Throne. Later, we tested doomsday
weapons in the deserts of Nevada and Utah. It is easy in such an
apocalyptic environment to forget that it has nourished life for
ages, easier still to forget our complicity in its destruction.</LD>
<TE>   For more than a century, scientists have warned about the carrying
capacity of Western lands. John Wesley Powell, who led an expedition
through the Grand Canyon in 1868, advised Congress 10 years later
that only 3% of the region could support intensive cultivation or
livestock grazing. But Powell's recommendations for limited
settlement were ignored, as was the recurring evidence of his
prescience: the deaths of millions of cattle during the 1880s, the
wholesale failure of early 20th century homesteads and the Dust Bowl
of the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the nature of arid lands, cow damaged landscapes are often
perceived as aesthetically pleasing, even though ecologically
wounded." So begins an essay by two seasoned environmentalists, Andy
Kerr and Mark Salvo, in "Welfare Ranching," an extravagantly
photographed super-size treatise that chronicles the devastation
wrought by livestock and argues for its removal from the West's
public lands.</TE>
<TE>   The unhorsing of the cowboy begins with the cover, a near poster
size dust jacket of a herd of cattle and a porcine wrangler mounted
not on a cow pony but on a far more efficient engine of pollution and
erosion, the gas-powered ATV. What follows is a series of critical
essays by 30 or so authors, scientists and historians, including the
late T.H. Watkins and the merry bandito of Western letters, Edward
Abbey.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, "Welfare Ranching" is the illustrated, fuel-injected
version of Debra L. Donahue's 1999 "The Western Range Revisited."
Donahue reaches back in time to vindicate the contemporary concerns
of Western environmentalists. She cites perhaps the most exhaustive
study of the Western range ever conducted. Issued in 1936 by the
Forest Service, it found that 98% of public rangelands had been
severely overgrazed and blamed it on Western stockmen's reckless
pursuit of quick profits, concluding that "care and restraint seemed
farfetched and visionary."</TE>
<TE>   The editors of "Welfare Ranching," George Wuerthner and Mollie
Matteson, set out to demonstrate that conditions haven't improved
appreciatively since the 1930s. They use statistics and photography
of "cow bombed" landscapes to contrast ranchers' paltry yields with
their gross expenditure of natural capital. A mere 22,000 ranchers
today have the run of 75% of Western public lands. Their grazing
rights take precedence over other uses on hundreds of millions of
acres in the public domain, including national forests and a few
national parks. At the same time, cattle ranching contributes to less
than 1% of the jobs and income in Western states, including
California. The contribution to the nation's food supply is equally
negligible.</TE>
<TE>   The unsuitability of the sparsely vegetated Western range is the
main reason, the authors argue, that ranchers have repeatedly relied
on taxpayers to bail them out. The federal emergency livestock feed
program has cost taxpayers up to $500 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the millions that have poured out of the public
coffers to pay for the ranchers' war on wildlife. Since the 1930s,
the federal animal damage control program, according to Donahue, has
financed the killing of some 4 million predators. The coyote has been
the main target, but the subsidized slaughter has also annihilated
hundreds of thousands of bears, wolves, bobcats, mountain lions and
even prairie dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Historian Bernard DeVoto said the West is a paradoxical place.
Conservative lawmakers fall all over themselves to distribute
billions of dollars in relief to people renowned for their rugged
independence, especially when it comes to resisting government
regulation. DeVoto once summed up the Westerner's attitude toward
government this way: "Get out and give us more money."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, looking out at the growing threats against Western open space
-- suburban growth, commercial recreation, the energy industry,
snowmobiles and the ubiquitous ATV -- one can't help being struck by
the narrow, obsessional focus of Wuerthner, Matteson and Donahue. The
cowboy certainly has earned his place in the pantheon of
environmental rascals, but he is growing long in the tooth, fewer in
numbers and, for the most part, poorer. Wuerthner, Matteson and
Donahue would evict him from the public land. But haven't we done
enough of that, beginning with the country's original inhabitants?
The nabobs of the radical right have already weighed in with a wicked
take on the Wuerthner strategy. They call it "rural cleansing."</TE>
<TE>   The two books give short shrift to a growing reform movement among
ranchers, exemplified by a group of not-so-rich Southwestern
livestock operators, Arizona's Malpai Borderlands Group, which won a
MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant a few years ago for protecting
wildlife on arid grazing land. Rather than give them credit,
Wuerthner and Matteson selected images that dwell on the failures of
the new breed.</TE>
<TE>   The Malpai ranchers may be part of a minority. Federal land
managers say that widespread overgrazing continues to wound a
drought-weakened range. Still, a reasonable case can be made that
ranching done right offers a bulwark against forces that would
permanently alter the landscape. To buy this argument, you have to
accept the messiness of even carefully managed livestock along with
the fact that injuries to the land will heal slowly. But consider the
alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   The transformation of open space to residential use is occurring
almost three times as fast in the Rocky Mountain region as anywhere
else in the country. The implications of all this for adjacent
wilderness areas and federal land are presented in "Ranching West of
the 100th Meridian: Culture, Ecology, and Economics," a measured,
hopeful brief for the future of ranching, edited by Richard L.
Knight, Wendell C. Gilgert and Ed Marston.</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the book is a discussion of what is lost when a
public lands rancher calls it quits. He doesn't just give up his
permit to graze in a national forest. He sells his adjacent private
property, his house and barns and the surrounding acreage. Typically,
it's prime land, with reliable water, good grass and expansive views.
It's where the wildlife goes when the high-country forage is frazzled
by drought or buried in snow. It's also what the developers are
buying up and turning into subdivisions.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, a wildlife biologist at Colorado State University, sums up
the effects of the suburban transformation. "With more people, more
dogs and cats, more cars and fences, more night lights perforating
the once-black night sky, the rich natural diversity that once
characterized the rural West will be altered forever." Knight quotes
a Wyoming rancher on the conduct of his ancestors: "I cannot change
how my relations lived on the land before I came, but I can work to
make the land better for my children."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, it's such a change in thinking that will make the
difference. Nor is it just the cowboy in need of an attitude
adjustment. We, too, are the enemy, careening across country in SUVs,
enjoying the view from mountainside ranchettes, teeing up in what was
once a hay meadow where elk browsed.</TE>
<TE>   There has always been something un-American and defeatist-sounding
about deferring to nature. The Bible exhorts us to subdue the Earth.
Hemmed in by forest, the New Englander valued "void ground" and
labored to make it so. In his book, "Down to Earth: Nature's Role in
American History," Ted Steinberg talks about our relationship with
the natural world as an ongoing effort to transform the Earth " ...
its soil, trees and even water ... into a set of commodities."</TE>
<TE>   In so doing, writes Steinberg, we have put our faith in exploitive
systems such as slavery and migrant labor to increase production and
boost yields. We have punished the Earth with hydraulic mining,
forest clear-cutting, one-crop agriculture and an array of chemicals.
Along the way, we came to see the Earth as a factory rather than an
organism on whose health we depend. "Commodities have a special
ability to hide from view not just the work, the sweat and the blood
that went into making them, but also the natural capital, the soil,
water and trees, without which they would not exist," Steinberg
writes.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg is a bit of a scold. Each chapter ends with a lesson.
But he is stressing a neglected dimension of our history. So much of
what has befallen us -- floods, fires, drought and pestilence, events
that have influenced war and depression, that have tested our resolve
and shaped our mythology -- were at least partially the result of the
way we treated the land. The most lethal forest fire in our history,
the 1871 inferno in Peshtigo, Wis., which killed nearly 1,500 people,
was kindled by brush piles left behind during a time of ravenous
industrial logging.</TE>
<TE>   The Dust Bowl years would have been milder, Steinberg points out,
if farmers had not plowed up millions of acres of native grass in
favor of more lucrative wheat crops. With a stable ground cover, the
wind-whipped erosion of the 1930s would have been less devastating.
Instead, it set in motion a migration that emptied out a third of the
populations of Southern Plains states.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as now, Washington blamed conditions beyond our control.
Today, listening to leaders of both major parties call for more
logging of national forests in order to reduce the fire danger, or
watching as they withhold conservation funds for farmers and
ranchers, one wonders what, if anything, we have learned about the
workings of nature.</TE>

<DH>Cuba Confidential, Love and Hate in the Two Havanas, Ann
Louise Bardach, Random House: 384 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carlos Eire</AU>
<BD>Carlos Eire is the author of the forthcoming "Waiting
for Snow in Havana: Confessions of a Cuban Boy." He is the T.
Lawrason Riggs professor of history and religious studies at Yale
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Pioneer's uniform. That's all. A measly uniform, worn by Elian
right after he was returned to Cuba. I couldn't stand looking at that
photo of him, and neither could thousands of other Cuban exiles in
the United States. It spoke to us in a language outsiders couldn't
even begin to understand. It seared our souls, and to many in America
our rage seemed so odd, so absurd. Like some primitive tribe
bewailing their fallen idols, we seemed to be grieving over nothing
substantial, or something other than what met the eye. This behavior
baffled millions of people, yet none of them cried out: "Call in the
anthropologist!" That is, until now.</LD>
<LD>   In one sense, Ann Louise Bardach's "Cuba Confidential" bears a
resemblance to works such as Claude Levi-Strauss' "The Savage Mind,"
Clifford Geertz's "The Religion of Java" and Victor Turner's "Forest
of Symbols," for "Cuba Confidential" is a book that seeks to unveil
to civilized eyes the seemingly cryptic meaning hidden deep within
the behavior of primitive aliens. In this case it's not the islanders
of some faraway archipelago who are analyzed but Cubans, both in
their native habitat and in their diaspora.</LD>
<TE>   Bardach does this by focusing on intrigue and unbridled emotions
at many levels of Cuban society: inside Castro's own family and inner
circle, among the players in the Elian epic and within the exile
community in Miami. She also seeks to reduce the last half century of
Cuban history to a simple formula: The Cuban Revolution should be
seen as a family feud. It's not really a story about five decades of
unrelenting totalitarian rule. It's all about kinfolk. Simply put,
Cubans are the Hatfields and McCoys of the Caribbean, and like all
such benighted clans, they have created an incestuous brawl in which
compromise and mediation become treason.</TE>
<TE>   It's all about unruly neighbors too. Bardach contends that this
tawdry melee has spilled over onto the streets and voting booths of
South Florida and the desks of policymakers in Washington, drawing
Americans into a fray that debases them and costs them dearly. If you
want to understand why Cuba is such a mess and why 10 U.S. presidents
have been unable to fix the problem, then, writes Bardach, focus on
love and hate, those two unreasonable passions that rule Cuban
politics and American policymaking.</TE>
<TE>   As the title suggests, this book seeks to disclose secrets. Few
American journalists are better poised to do this than Bardach. For
many years she has been covering Cuba on both sides of the Florida
Strait. Her work has appeared in the most venerable newspapers and
magazines; network television and National Public Radio often call
upon her to shed light on all things Cuban. That Bardach knows Miami
and Cuba from the inside out is undeniable: Her contacts are
wide-ranging in both places, her research is thorough and meticulous,
her access to key figures is impressive. She has quizzed Castro and
joked with his brother Raul. She has also interviewed scores of
high-profile players in recent Cuba affairs, including some of
Castro's and Elian's relatives, and some of Castro's most passionate
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   So, then, what is it that she has to show us? What we find here is
not a cache of secrets but rather a collection of tales about
troubled relationships among Cubans of all sorts. For instance, we
learn that Fidel Castro was once involved in a bitter custody dispute
with his first wife, Mirta Diaz-Balart, and that he kidnapped their
son. When this story is juxtaposed with that of Elian Gonzalez, we
can recognize the distant echoes of this all-too- familiar drama. We
are also reminded that Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) is the
nephew of Castro's first wife and thus also a first cousin to
Castro's oldest son, "Fidelito." We are led to see why Diaz-Balart
carries heavy emotional baggage in all of his attempts to sway
Congress to vote for "retrograde legislation" concerning Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   We are taken deep inside the households connected by blood and
marriage to Elian Gonzalez, both in Cuba and Florida. We are reminded
at every turn of the absence of ideology and of the soap-opera plot
lines that led to the boat wreck, the custody war and the media
frenzy: We learn that Elian's mother didn't flee Cuba in a flimsy
skiff because she was seeking freedom but rather because her love
life was a mess and that the same passionate disorder extended to
everyone else on that ill-fated voyage and to the family members who
battled for custody of Elian.</TE>
<TE>   We learn of the many misdeeds and strong-arm tactics of the
so-called hard-line leaders who seem to control the Cuban community
in South Florida with an iron fist, men who are described by Bardach
as "the roughest, toughest crowd this side of the mujahideen." We are
shown that their view of leadership is quite similar to Castro's and
are told that all South Floridians live in a state of fear that is
perhaps more profound than that of the people of Cuba. We are
constantly reminded of the power wielded by Cubans in Dade County and
also of the fact that "the depth and breadth of corruption in Miami
is unparalleled in the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Before long we come to realize that, sadly, Cubans are incapable
of understanding or following the basic principles of democratic
government and that it is largely because of them that South Florida
has turned into a banana republic. And this last item brings the
reader full circle to the beginning, for Bardach traces Castro's
hatred of America to his thirst for vengeance against the United
Fruit Co., which not only employed his father-in-law and held parties
at which he was snubbed but also competed for banana-growing land
with his own very rich father.</TE>
<TE>   That Bardach has been stung by Cuban passion is evident. When it
comes to hate, she has felt both the wrath of Castro, whose
government shut her out from Cuba for some time, and the ire of the
exile "hard-liners" in South Florida, those "mujahideen" who have
tried to intimidate her. When it comes to love, it is clear that she
has sunk roots into both Cuban communities and that, like all who are
embraced by foreigners who are at one another's throats, her love is
hemmed in by question marks and no small measure of suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   Her command of detail is far too intimate, her affection for Cuban
slang and for those who use it too transparent. In many ways, this
highly engrossing collection of narratives is perhaps as close to an
inside view of the Cuban mess as one can hope for from an outsider.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, when all is said and done, this remains an outsider's view
and a very arbitrary one at that. However much "Cuba Confidential" is
written with a magisterial voice, it raises serious questions about
the ability of any outsider to interpret another people and their
history, about objectivity, journalistic license and the line between
reporting and editorializing.</TE>
<TE>   Bardach's approach resembles impressionist art: by reducing
everything to the personal and psychological level and by glossing
over the ethical and political questions that bedevil all Cubans, she
enhances some details at the expense of others and provides a highly
stylized view that cannot possibly be shared by the subjects
themselves. The ability to create such an impressionistic lens is
itself a highly contrived privilege available only to those who have
lived their entire lives in a supposedly un-ideological universe in
which political rights are guaranteed, including freedom of speech.
It's above all a very American privilege.</TE>
<TE>   No Cuban could have the freedom of movement, the comforts or the
access to powerful elites granted within Cuba to an American
journalist. No Cuban anywhere could easily conceive of his or her own
history the way Bardach does. It would require imagining the
impossible and at the same time denying what is most obvious.</TE>
<TE>   All historians and journalists engage in reductionism -- or spin
-- to some extent, and reductionism has its virtues: By simplifying
complex scenarios, a skilled writer does often hit upon truth. But it
is only a partial truth, and the more one simplifies, the more
fragmentary the truth becomes. Bardach is correct in viewing the
Cuban mess as a family feud or as something governed by passion. She
is also correct in identifying streaks of megalomania and intolerance
in Miami and Havana. Yes, this is all true enough, and it makes for
good reading. But there is also much more at issue than love and hate
or the boiling over of hot Latin blood.</TE>
<TE>   At bottom, Bardach's understanding of Cubans lacks sensitivity to
the logic of coercive governments and of those who oppose them. Which
brings us back to Elian's Pioneer garb. When she suggests that the
Pioneer uniform worn by schoolchildren in Cuba is not unlike that
worn by students in Catholic schools in the United States -- and that
it was ridiculous for Cuban exiles to be upset by photos that showed
Elian dressed as a Pioneer -- one crucial distinction is ignored: In
the United States, wearing a Catholic school uniform is a matter of
choice, at least for the parents, but in Cuba the Pioneer uniform is
forced upon all children. Moreover, Bardach fails to see that the
Pioneer uniform stands for a rigidly doctrinaire and paramilitary
educational system in which even the math problems are loaded with
ideological content. Comparing Pioneer garb to Nazi Youth uniforms
would have been much more appropriate, that is, unless Bardach means
to equate Catholic schools with the Third Reich.</TE>
<TE>   Which in a roundabout way brings us to something Bardach barely
mentions: Operation Pedro Pan. Few Americans know that 14,000
unaccompanied Cuban children were willingly sent to the States by
their parents from 1960 to 1962, in sheer desperation, out of concern
for the very questions Bardach dismisses, namely those that have to
do with human rights. Enough Elians to fill a whole suburb,
unnoticed; grief beyond measure, purposely embraced. Most of these
instant orphans had no relatives or friends who could take them in
upon arriving in Florida, and everyone involved knew that there was a
very good chance of never seeing each other again. Why would any
mother or father choose to do this? Of course the answer is
bewilderingly complex, but one factor loomed large in the reasoning
of these parents: They feared seeing their children turn into
Pioneers. This was not an unreasonable choice but a logical one. By
law, the new constitution drafted by Castro and his cohorts made the
Revolution the ultimate guardian of all Cuban children. This was no
mere legal technicality but a real threat to all parents. Many
teenagers were already being forcibly sent on Revolutionary errands
within Cuba or to some of the satellite states of the Soviet Union;
kids from the countryside were being plucked from their families and
sent to Pioneer camps in Havana.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the choice of seeing their children dressed as Pioneers
in Cuba and the Soviet bloc or as paupers in the United States,
thousands of parents opted for the humbler apparel and the grief that
came with it. As many saw it, they had no other choice. Freedom was
that important to them. Bardach mentions this episode in Cuban
history briefly, in one paragraph about midway through the book, and
the spin she puts on it sums up her perspective.</TE>
<TE>   According to her, being subjected to the Pedro Pan exodus counts
as a privilege: The airlift was a "perk" that has been not awarded to
any other immigrant group -- some sort of economic aid package -- and
it serves as proof that Cuban exiles have been coddled, and that
their success story in the States has more to do with American
largess than with any positive cultural traits they might claim as
their own.</TE>
<TE>   Good grief. Never mind what the parents suffered: that should be
obvious to anyone who empathized with Elian's father. Think of the
kids. Operation Pedro Pan was no Head Start program. Most of these
boys and girls spent years on their own because Castro's government
prevented their parents from leaving Cuba. Many ended up living in
squalid, brutal places, including orphanages and halfway houses for
delinquents. Some had to drop out of school or put it on the back
burner. Many were never reunited with their families. All were
scarred for life by the experience, and yet all had to compete for
their share of the American pie as Hispanics, an ethnic minority that
many Americans continue to view as inferior and quite incapable of
rational behavior.</TE>
<TE>   I know this because I was one of those kids. If such an ordeal
counts as a perk, or if it really has nothing to do with the pursuit
of freedom, please send me to hell; it's bound to be a much more
reasonable place. Besides, in hell no one will blame us Cubans for
ruining the neighborhood. Not even the journalists.</TE>

<HD>An illuminating crossroad of time and mind</HD>
<DH>The Lunar Men: Five Friends Whose Curiosity Changed the
World, Jenny Uglow, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 596 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Hamblyn</AU>
<BD>Richard Hamblyn is the author of "The Invention of
Clouds: How an Amateur Meteorologist Forged the Language of the
Skies," which won the 2001 Los Angeles Times Book Prize in science
and technology, and is the editor of a forthcoming anthology of 18th
century science writing.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The book of Nature is open to all men," wrote the 18th century
British geologist John Whitehurst, "and perhaps in no part of the
world more so than in Derbyshire." This striking claim, a coalition
between the global democracy of knowledge -- "Nature is open to all"
-- and a profound sense of local attachment and pride, expresses one
of the more likable features of the age of the Enlightenment; it
gives a good indication, too, of the spirit in which Jenny Uglow's
latest book has been written.</LD>
<LD>   As a celebration of a local milieu as well as a world culture that
emerged both within it and around it, "The Lunar Men: Five Friends
Whose Curiosity Changed the World" is a compelling exploration of the
Enlightenment, an age of ambition and change -- and of crowds. Dozens
of individuals roam the pages of this teeming campus of a book, and
we watch as they meet, talk, ally themselves, argue, collaborate,
drift apart, grow old and die, and at times it is as if we meet them
too, as if Uglow takes us gently by the arm and walks us through the
streets of Birmingham and Derby to introduce us to her cast of
characters and to let us in on their conversations as they scheme and
laugh and talk their way through the world that they helped to shape.</LD>
<TE>   As all this suggests, "The Lunar Men" is a work of history that
foregrounds personality, friendship and alliance to build a wider
picture of the period. In this case, the method is well suited to the
material, for the Lunar Society of Birmingham, to which the title of
the book alludes, was nothing if not a creative collision of
temperaments and personalities. A group of like-minded British
friends who began to meet once a month during the 1760s, the Lunar
Society gathered on the Monday nearest the full moon so that its
members might have some light by which to make their way home along
the unlit roads of pre-industrial England.</TE>
<TE>   The group was amorphous, depending for its shape upon whoever was
around on the day, but at one time or another most of the greatest
figures of 18th century industry and science were involved in the
club: Erasmus Darwin, the poet and inventor (and grandfather of
Charles), to whom Uglow refers as "the grit in the oyster" in an
excellent invocation of his catalyzing presence; Josiah Wedgewood,
pioneering potter and industrialist extraordinaire; John Whitehurst,
the geologist and clockmaker, whose words were quoted at the
beginning of this review; Joseph Priestley, radical preacher and one
of the earlier discoverers of oxygen; and Matthew Boulton and James
Watt, the celebrated makers of engines and fortunes. Benjamin
Franklin, too, kept up a correspondence with many of the regular
members, and he may well have attended a Lunar meeting or two during
the long years he spent in Britain as agent and ambassador.</TE>
<TE>   As Uglow emphasizes throughout the book, these were extraordinary
people who lived in extraordinary times, and it is evident from their
letters to one another that they were aware of it too. "It may be my
fate to be a kind of comet, or flaming meteor in science," wrote
Joseph Priestley in 1775, and some of the most revealing sections of
"The Lunar Men" deal with the issues of self-image and self-promotion
that began to emerge from the intensely entrepreneurial cultures of
Europe and North America.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Uglow's Lunatics were publicists through and through,
which is one of the reasons they remain so accessible in the archives
today. Take James Watt, for example, the Scottish-born industrialist
and manufacturer, whose greatest success lay in convincing the world
that he had invented the steam engine. Anyone who has stubbed their
toe on Watt's larger-than-life marble statue that sprawls across the
vestibule of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh
(it's far too big to be taken into the building) will have
encountered something of the solid ambition of the man. Watt's genius
lay in recognizing the possibilities of a century-old technology and
then in turning himself and his friends into its chief beneficiaries.
He was, in some respects, the Bill Gates of the steam engine: not its
inventor, but its leading patron and promoter.</TE>
<TE>   But then this is how industry has always worked, and Uglow is at
her best, both as a historian and a biographer, in tracing the
complex networks of ideas and alliances that conspired to put
inventions and, more specifically, patents, into one pair of hands
and not another. Friendship and rivalry stalk these pages like the
figures of virtues from a tapestry, while questions of priority --
who was the first to discover or invent, whose name will go on to be
remembered or forgotten? -- fueled the anxieties over money and
reputation that smoldered away in the backgrounds of these lives.
"These men should not die," as Erasmus Darwin once said about his
friends, and his words are aptly quoted by Uglow, an author who does
so much, and so well, to breathe new life into her subjects.</TE>
<TE>   Admirers of Uglow's previous book, "Hogarth," will be familiar
with her skill in illuminating ideas and artifacts from the past --
in this case, 18th century science and technology -- by picturing
them in their cultural, social and personal contexts. This approach,
evident on every page and in the work of a generation of like-minded
historians, is particularly well-suited to the history of an activity
as social as science. In fact, "The Lunar Men" has a particularly
illustrious predecessor in Robert E. Schofield's "The Lunar Society
of Birmingham," a pioneering study published in 1963 that hasn't
dated a bit.</TE>
<TE>   Schofield's book, a milestone in the history of science, was one
of the first major pieces of scholarship that explicitly attempted to
account for the emergence of new ideas by framing them in their
social and personal milieus. This approach has proved so influential
that it is now hard to imagine how the history of ideas could be
written in any other way. In fact, one of the many pleasures afforded
by Uglow's book is the realization that it probably couldn't.</TE>

<HD>A pilgrim's quest for answers to an ancient puzzle</HD>
<DH>Across the Sabbath River, In Search of a Lost Tribe of
Israel, Hillel Halkin, Houghton Mifflin: 400 pp., $28</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Kirsch</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To assert that one of the "Ten Lost Tribes" ended up in a remote
backwater of India and Burma, as Hillel Halkin does in "Across the
Sabbath River," is mostly a matter of conjecture, if not merely a
literary conceit. Even so, Halkin puts the notion to good use in a
book that is, at once, an armchair adventure, a historical mystery
and an almost novelistic account of encounters with the exotic all
over South Asia.</LD>
<LD>   The starting point for "Across the Sabbath River" is the Bible,
which reports the conquest and dispersion of 10 out of 12 tribes of
ancient Israel in distant antiquity, thus adding the lost tribes to
the list of biblical mysteries that includes such all-time favorites
as the whereabouts of Noah's ark, the grave of Moses and the ark of
the covenant.</LD>
<LD>   The most likely explanation is plausible but unremarkable: Some of
the "lost" Israelites re-emerged into history as the people known as
the Samaritans, while others simply assimilated into the populations
of the places to which they were exiled nearly 3,000 years ago. But
there is a long and colorful tradition, if also a deeply eccentric
one, that suggests various other explanations: The Armenians, the
Japanese, the Maori, the Native Americans, the Welsh and the Zulus
have all been proposed as the descendants of the lost tribes.</LD>
<TE>   Into that tradition steps Halkin, a man with a sense of adventure,
a gift for spinning a yarn and an almost obsessive interest in
solving the mystery of the lost tribes. As if to acknowledge the
whimsical nature of his enterprise, Halkin's title refers to the
legend that the 10 lost tribes ended up on the far side of a river
called the Sambatyon, whose roiling currents are impassable for six
days of the week but restful on the Sabbath. But Halkin is utterly
earnest about his search to find hard historical evidence that links
the biblical legend to flesh-and-blood human beings in our world.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Bible says the tribes were carried away and will return,
they were carried away and will return," insists Eliahu Avichail, the
charismatic rabbi who inspired Halkin to undertake his quest and with
whom Halkin traveled on portions of his trek. "But you have to look
for them in the right places."</TE>
<TE>   Halkin invites us along on his wanderings through China, Thailand,
Burma and India, where he encounters a series of welcoming but mostly
baffled locals across a vast stretch of South Asia. After a few false
starts and dead ends, Halkin comes to focus on an ancient but obscure
community in northeastern India, the Mizo people of Mizoram and
Manipur and related communities in Burma and Bangladesh, as likely
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Halkin was intrigued by reports that the Mizo had once practiced
the rite of circumcision, although he acknowledges that they could
have adopted the ritual from Islam. He is also forced to concede that
two other fundamental practices of Judaism are unknown to them:
observance of the Sabbath and dietary laws. But he insists that other
commonalities between biblical tradition and Mizo tradition are too
numerous to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more customs with biblical parallels kept turning up,"
Halkin argues in support of the claim. "A seven-day period of
mourning for the dead.... A four-cornered altar on whose posts was
sprinkled the blood of sacrificed animals.... A single supreme God."</TE>
<TE>   "Across the Sabbath River" belongs on the same shelf with the
bestselling "Walking the Bible" by Bruce Feiler and "At the Entrance
to the Garden of Eden" by Yossi Klein Halevi. Halkin, like Feiler and
Halevi, draws on the richest and strangest of biblical traditions to
let us see and understand more about the world we actually live in.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not the Mizo people are descended from the lost tribes
-- and Halkin allows that the case is not proven -- the conjecture is
ultimately less important than the commonalities that he finds
between peoples of such different backgrounds and places.</TE>

<HD>The free speech education of Lenny Bruce</HD>
<DH>The Trials of Lenny Bruce: The Fall and Rise of an American
Icon, Ronald K.L. Collins &amp; David M. Skover,  Sourcebooks Inc.: 546
pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Krassner</AU>
<BD>Paul Krassner is the author of "Murder at the
Conspiracy Convention and Other American Absurdities." He is working
on a novel inspired by his association with Lenny Bruce.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I originally met Lenny Bruce in 1959 at the Hotel America in New
York. He was scheduled to perform at a midnight show at Town Hall. I
had already published an interview with him in The Realist that was
conducted by mail, and now I handed him the succeeding issue, which
featured an interview with psychologist Albert Ellis, including a
discussion of the semantics of profanity. The problem words were
spelled out rather than using asterisks or dashes, as was the
practice in mainstream media. Bruce had been resorting to euphemisms
on stage, and he was amazed that I could get away with it. "Are you
telling me this is legal to sell on the newsstands?"</LD>
<LD>   "Absolutely," I replied. "the Supreme Court's definition of
obscenity is that it has to be material which appeals to your
prurient interest." Bruce magically produced an unabridged dictionary
from the suitcase on his bed, and he looked up the word "prurient."</LD>
<LD>   "Itching," he mused, "what does that mean, that they can bust a
novelty-store owner for selling itching powder along with the dribble
glass and the whoopie cushion?"</LD>
<TE>   I explained, "It's just their way of saying that something gets
you horny." Bruce closed the dictionary, mock-clenching his jaw and
nodding his head in affirmation of a new discovery: "So it's against
the law to get you horny!"</TE>
<TE>   We became friends and, a few years later, when Playboy planned to
publish his autobiography, "How to Talk Dirty and Influence People,"
I was appointed his editor. There have been other books since, but
"The Trials of Lenny Bruce," written by a pair of diligent attorneys,
Ronald K.L. Collins and David M. Skover, is the first fully recorded
history of Bruce's relationship with the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to the traditional stand-up comics of the 1950s who told
mysogynist jokes about their wives' cooking, driving and frigidity,
Lenny Bruce was a cultural mutation. With empathetic irreverence, he
would create mini-theatrical dialogues -- about racism, sexuality,
nuclear testing, teachers' salaries, drug laws, abortion rights,
organized religion -- peppered with improvised spoken-jazz riffs. He
loved to play show-and-tell with his audiences. When Gary Cooper
died, he brought the New York Daily News on stage to share a
headline: "The Last Roundup!" And after he heard "Spanish Harlem" on
the radio, he bought the record, came on stage with a phonograph and
played it. "Listen to these lyrics," he said. "This is like a Puerto
Rican 'Porgy &amp; Bess.' "</TE>
<TE>   When John F. Kennedy won the presidential election in 1960, a
young unknown impressionist, Vaughn Meader, seized the opportunity.
He began to comb his hair with a flamboyant pompadour that dipped
across his forehead. He consciously regressed to the Boston accent
that he had tried so hard to lose. And he produced a comedy album,
"The First Family," that broke sales records and turned him into a
star. A week after the assassination of JFK, Lenny Bruce kept his
commitment to perform at the Village Theater on the Lower East Side.
The country was still in a state of shock, and the atmosphere at the
theater was especially tense. The entire audience was anticipating
what Bruce would say about the assassination. He walked on stage and
removed the microphone from its stand. When the applause for his
entrance subsided, he just stood there for several seconds, milking
the tension. "Whew!" he finally whistled into the microphone. "Vaughn
Meader is screwed." Although Collins and Skover meticulously
researched "The Trials of Lenny Bruce" -- finding the transcripts for
each one of the trials took years -- one error via a secondhand
source must be acknowledged here. Referring to Bruce's classic
opening line at that post-assassination show, the authors incorrectly
write: "With a paranoid fix on the jam-packed audience, he broke the
silence: 'Don't shoot!' "</TE>
<TE>   Although Bruce was arrested several times, ostensibly on obscenity
charges, his actual offense was blasphemy, as in his routine
"Religions, Inc.," and he knew it. "The reason I've been busted a lot
these last couple of years is because of [my] religious point of
view. That's what it's all been about." In December 1962, Bruce was
performing at the Gate of Horn in Chicago. He had been reading a
study of anti-Semitism by Jean-Paul Sartre, and he was intrigued by
the implications of a statement by Adolf Eichmann, orchestrator of
the Holocaust, that he would have been "not only a scoundrel, but a
despicable pig" if he hadn't carried out Hitler's orders. Bruce wrote
a piece for The Realist, "Letter From a Soldier's Wife" -- namely,
Mrs. Eichmann -- pleading for compassion to spare her husband's life.
Now, on stage, he credited Thomas Merton's poem about the Holocaust,
and requested that all the lights go off except one dim blue spot.
Then he began what was perhaps his most audacious satire, speaking
with a German accent: "My name is Adolf Eichmann. And the Jews came
every day to what they thought would be fun in the showers. People
say I should have been hung. 'Nein.' Do you recognize the whore in
the middle of you -- that you would have done the same if you were
there yourselves? My defense: I was a soldier. I saw the end of a
conscientious day's effort. I watched through the portholes. I saw
every Jew burned and turned into soap. Do you people think yourselves
better because you burned your enemies at long distance with missiles
without ever seeing what you had done to them? Hiroshima, 'auf
Wiedersehen.' [German accent ends.] If we would have lost the war,
they would have strung [President] Truman up by the balls ...."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce was arrested on obscenity charges that night. One of the
items in the police report complained: "Then talking about the war he
stated, 'If we would have lost the war, they would have strung Truman
up by the balls." The head of the vice squad warned the manager of
the Gate of Horn: "If this man ever uses a four-letter word in this
club again, I'm going to pinch you and everyone in here. If he ever
speaks against religion, I'm going to pinch you and everyone in here.
Do you understand? You've had good people here. But he mocks the pope
-- and I'm speaking as a Catholic -- I'm here to tell you your
license is in danger. We're going to have someone here watching every
show." Chicago had the largest number of Roman Catholics of any
archdiocese in the country. Bruce's jury consisted entirely of
Catholics. The judge was Catholic. The prosecutor and his assistant
were Catholic. On Ash Wednesday, the judge removed the spot of ash
from his forehead and ordered the bailiff to instruct all the others
to do likewise. The sight of a judge, two prosecutors and 12 jurors,
every one with a spot of ash on their foreheads, had the surrealistic
flavor of a wild Brucean image. In San Francisco, a jury had found
Lenny Bruce not guilty of obscenity -- arresting officers admitted on
the witness stand that his material didn't arouse their prurient
interest -- but in Chicago, the judge refused to permit that line of
cross-examination by the defense. Bruce wondered, "What's wrong with
appealing to the prurient interest? We appeal to the killing
interest."</TE>
<TE>   "I figured out after four years why I got arrested so many times,"
Bruce would say. "I do my act at, perhaps, 11 at night; little do I
know that 11 a.m. the next morning, before the grand jury somewhere,
there's another guy doing my act who's introduced as Lenny Bruce in
substance.... A peace officer ... does the act. The grand jury
watches him work and says, 'That stinks!' But I get busted. And the
irony is I have to go to court and defend his act."</TE>
<TE>   Usually, that would consist of a list of offensive words taken out
of context. Inspector Herbert S. Ruhe, a former CIA agent in Vietnam,
was assigned to monitor Bruce's show at the Cafe Au Go Go in
Greenwich Village. He submitted his notes to Richard H. Kuh, an
assistant district attorney, who took the matter directly to
Manhattan Dist. Atty. Frank Hogan. Bruce would later comment on
Ruhe's courtroom performance: "This guy is bumbling, and I'm going to
jail. He's not only got it all wrong, but now he thinks he's a comic.
I'm going to be judged on his bad timing, his ego, his garbled
language."</TE>
<TE>   Ruhe also testified that Bruce had engaged in obscene conduct.
"Bruce moved the microphone backwards and forwards for a few minutes,
something like this" -- simulating a masturbatory act -- "he was
making a gesture towards his crotch." Later, appealing to a
three-judge panel, Bruce pleaded: "Your honor, the gestures,
masturbations, were gestures of benediction. I did a bit on
Catholicism. How perverse [my attorney] would be to defend me for
gestures of masturbation. They were meant to be gestures of
benediction .... The court hasn't heard the show .... [P]lease let me
testify. Let me tell you what the show is about .... Finally to talk
to the court .... Please, your honor, I so desperately want your
respect .... Don't finish me off in show business. Don't lock up
these 6,000 words."</TE>
<TE>   In an incongruous fantasy at the Au Go Go, Bruce had confessed,
"The most beautiful body I've ever seen was at a party in 1945. I was
in the bedroom getting the coats. The powder-room door had been left
intentionally ajar, and I viewed the most perfect bosom peeking out
from the man-tailored blouse above a tweed pegged skirt .... Eleanor
Roosevelt had the prettiest tits I had ever seen or dreamed that I
had seen ...." Bruce was arrested for giving an obscene performance,
and at the top of the police complaint was "Eleanor Roosevelt and her
display of tits." Ultimately, Bruce fired all his lawyers and
defended himself. He was found guilty, even though the law stated
that, to be obscene, material must be utterly without any redeeming
social importance; thus, if one single person felt that Bruce's
performances had the slightest bit of redeeming social importance --
and there were several who so testified -- then he should have been
found not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce's most relevant argument concerned the very obscenity
statute that he'd been accused of violating. As his legal homework,
he had obtained the legislative history of that statute from Albany,
and he discovered that in 1931 there had been an amendment proposed
that excluded from arrest in an obscene performance: stagehands,
spectators, musicians and -- here was the fulcrum of his defense --
actors. The law had been misapplied to him. Despite opposition by the
New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, the amendment had
finally been signed into law by then-New York Gov. Roosevelt.
"Ignoring the mandate of Franklin D. Roosevelt," observed Lenny the
lawyer, "is a great deal more offensive than saying Eleanor has
lovely nay-nays." Before sentencing, prosecutor Kuh recommended that
no mercy be granted because Bruce had shown "a complete lack of any
remorse whatsoever." Bruce responded, "I'm not here for remorse but
for justice. The issue is not obscenity but that I spit in the face
of authority." The face of authority spit back at Bruce by sentencing
him to four months in the workhouse. In the press room of the
Criminal Courts Building, a reporter asked, "Do you believe in
obscenity?" Bruce replied, "What do you mean? Do I believe we should
pray for obscenity?"</TE>
<TE>   Bruce was a comedic pioneer who only wanted to exercise the same
freedom to communicate without compromise on stage that he had in his
living room. What's shocking about "The Trials of Lenny Bruce" is not
his utterances so much as the contrast between what he got arrested
for and what is now taken for granted by the audiences of talented
performers such as George Carlin, Margaret Cho and Chris Rock, and in
the critical reception of such taboo-breaking cable-TV series as "Sex
and the City" and "Six Feet Under." Today, Robin Williams freely
pantomimes cunnilingus, and the cable-TV series "South Park" proudly
presents a sponsored, highly scatological episode about priestly
child abuse. Bruce realized that prosecutors and judges were more
interested in the advancement of their own careers than in his
free-speech rights. In fact, wrote Nat Hentoff in the Village Voice,
"Three lawyers in Kuh's bureau, appalled at Bruce being set up ...
begged Kuh to hear Bruce for himself, and then decide whether Bruce
ought to be busted. Kuh ... refused, adding, 'Stay out of this unless
you want to be switched to the rackets bureau.' " And, according to
one attorney, "After the trial of Bruce was over, I had a call from
Judge Creel, who ... said Judge Phipps also wanted to acquit Bruce
but that [Chief] Judge Murtagh threatened to assign him to traffic
court for the rest of his term if he did." In a documentary about
Hogan, the New York district attorney, former Asst. Dist. Atty.
Vincent Cuccia confessed: "[Bruce] was prosecuted because of his
words. He didn't harm anybody, he didn't commit an assault, he didn't
steal, he didn't engage in any conduct which directly harmed someone
else. So therefore he was punished first and foremost because of the
words that he used. It's wrong to prosecute anybody because of his
ideas. It was the only thing I did in Hogan's office that I'm really
ashamed of. We drove him into poverty and used the law to kill him."</TE>
<TE>   "The date of Lenny Bruce's death," in 1966, the authors of "The
Trials of Lenny Bruce" conclude, "is as good a marker as any of the
moment when words alone -- any performance words spoken in comedy
clubs -- ceased to be targets of prosecution." The book comes with an
CD containing relevant excerpts from interviews and Bruce's
performances, ranging from his poetic descriptions (a judge with
"thick fingers and the homemade glass eye") to his bit about
prosecutors using in court the same words that Bruce got arrested
for: "[Bruce] said 'blah-blah-blah' -- then I dug something -- they
liked saying 'blah-blah-blah.' " Moreover, hidden in the gray attache
case that Bruce always carried into court was a portable reel-to-reel
tape recorder, which captured Kuh reveling in those words as he
cross-examined witnesses for the defense.</TE>
<TE>   "The Trials of Lenny Bruce" serves as the missing link between two
of Bruce's statements: "In the Halls of Justice, the only justice is
in the halls." And, "I love the law." Indeed, as club owners became
increasingly afraid to hire him, he devoted more and more time and
energy to the law, and when he finally got a booking in Monterey, he
admitted, "I feel like it's taking me away from my work."</TE>

<HD>A liar's tale from the Middle Ages</HD>
<DH>Baudolino, A Novel, Umberto Eco, Translated from the
Italian by William Weaver, Harcourt: 522 pp., $27</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Iain Pears</AU>
<BD>Iain Pears is the author of, most recently, "The Dream
of Scipio."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many years ago, when I was a jobbing reporter for a news agency in
Rome, we received a circular from a publisher inviting one of our
number to go to Bologna to interview a professor of semiotics who had
written a novel. It was a quiet period, but there was little
enthusiasm for taking up the offer, despite Bologna's reputation as
the culinary capital of Italy. A semiotician writing a novel, it was
generally concluded, would be a bit like Samuel Johnson's dog walking
on two legs: It is not done well, but you are surprised to find it
done at all. In my case, a trip to Naples seemed more promising, and
the job of interviewing the author went to a reporter who usually
occupied himself with the stock market reports.</LD>
<LD>   Big mistake. Professor Umberto Eco's book, "The Name of the Rose,"
went on to become a worldwide publishing phenomenon, selling millions
of copies, more or less inventing the literary thriller, breathing
new life into the much-maligned historical novel and convincing
readers and publishers alike that even immensely abstruse and complex
ideas were not necessarily an instant sentence of death for a work of
fiction.</LD>
<TE>   Revisiting the book two decades later, I find it is still a
marvel. It's not without its faults, of course, but Eco somehow
manages to pull off the alchemist's trick and transform what would
have been glaring and possibly fatal flaws in any other book into
major strengths. Certainly, he would be hammered in any creative
writing course for the way he allows the narrative to stop dead for
pages while he examines some obscure point of medieval theology of
only tangential relevance, or inserts a conversation about classical
philosophy (as understood in the 14th century), or lards the prose
with Latin tags for which he declines to give any translation. The
mastery lies in the fact that none of this matters; it even
contributes greatly to the book's appeal: Readers become swept up in
Eco's almost boyish enthusiasms, and they are prepared to indulge him
his little ways because he is so clearly enjoying himself.</TE>
<TE>   In the novels that followed, however, the faults stayed as faults:
"Foucault's Pendulum," in particular, is an unwieldy beast, lacking
the joie de vivre of "The Name of the Rose," with a style that tips
over into the self-indulgent. The ideas and the story never mesh
particularly well, and reading it is something of a chore. In his
latest novel, however, Eco has fortunately recovered his sense of
fun, and "Baudolino" manifests many of the exuberant extravagances
that made "The Name of the Rose" so hugely enjoyable.</TE>
<TE>   The novel is the story of Baudolino, an Italian of poor origin who
is adopted by Frederick Barbarossa, the 12th century Holy Roman
emperor. The tale is his life story as told to Niketas, a Byzantine
nobleman whom Baudolino saves during the sack of Constantinople by
forces from the West in 1204. He tells of wonderful things, in
particular how he became a liar and discovered that the lies he told
became true or better than true. Frederick needs a little bit of help
to raise his prestige, so Baudolino discovers the corpses of the
three Magi for him. He knows they are not the three Magi, but no
matter: They become the bodies of the three Eastern kings in the
Bible.</TE>
<TE>   He goes to study in Paris, and he dreams with friends of Prester
John, the legendary Christian king from the Far East, near the
earthly paradise at the very edge of the world. He writes a letter
from Prester John to Frederick, and the letter takes on a life of its
own, almost bringing the kingdom into existence, so convincingly that
Baudolino and friends set off to discover it. Other metamorphoses
follow, for example, Baudolino's father's drinking cup, hewn from a
root, becomes the Holy Grail. It takes on magical powers because
Baudolino thinks the cup Christ drank from should be as simple as his
father's, rather than something richly decorated with gold and
jewels.</TE>
<TE>   The book is a liar's tale, another contribution to the fibbers'
chronicles that were probably already well-established as a genre
when "The Odyssey" appeared and that have carried on more or less
without a break to the memoirs of politicians today. Had it been done
straight, the book could have become tedious, but throughout, Eco
twists the braggart's narrative because not only is Baudolino a liar,
he also knows he is a liar.</TE>
<TE>   It consequently becomes a very Eco-ish game in that we are reading
a fiction about a fiction that often contains yet more levels of
fiction. We know we are meant to disbelieve the narrative somewhere,
but there is always the slight discomfort of trying to work out
where, exactly, our incredulity is meant to settle. Thus, when
Baudolino has a discussion with a Greek monk about strange animals
called methagallinarii, are these something that Eco has invented? Or
the monk? Or Baudolino in reporting the conversation? Were they
creatures that were considered credible in the Middle Ages? Eco is
having one of his jokes with the reader, but only a true expert on
medieval myth and iconography would know what, exactly, the joke is.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the author is engaged in a continuous subversion not
only of the forms of the historical novel -- which depends on a sort
of contract between author and reader that disbelief will be
suspended for the duration even when the period being described is
well-known -- but also of our engagement with any sort of narrative
at all. In so doing, of course, he is making a point about the nature
of belief itself and giving an insight into the medieval mind, which
had no effective theoretical or practical means of checking
information to see whether it should be credited or not. It is quite
a disorienting experience and very effectively done.</TE>
<TE>   The strangeness reaches its climax when Baudolino and his motley
band of associates head east to find Prester John, and the travels
slowly turn into an imitation of the medieval tales of exploration,
full of strange beasts and people, miraculous happenings and dangers.
Once more, we are not sure whether Baudolino believes what he is
telling us, not least because the narrative keeps switching from
first person (which we can safely distrust, most of the time) to
third person (which in fiction we are usually supposed to believe).
They cross the Sambatyon, a river of stone; meet the giants and
pygmies, one-legged skiapods, the blemmyae who have no heads or
necks, the panotians who learn to fly using their gigantic ears.
Despite their grotesque appearance, the creatures can tell one
another apart only by their different understandings of the
Incarnation and the Holy Trinity. They are captured by cynocephali
and escape by flying away on the legs of rocs; Baudolino briefly
changes from sinner to stylite before trying once more to find the
legendary kingdom. At other stages, we have discussions on the
vacuum, the nature of the universe and whether it resembles the ark
of the covenant, and we form a nodding acquaintance with Dionysius'
ear, Archimedes' mirror and a dozen or so examples of John the
Baptist's head.</TE>
<TE>   The one criticism with the book is that the language is not always
as sure as it might be, and while Eco is an expert at engaging the
attention for an account of hashish and the Assassins, even he has to
struggle to make the politics of the Holy Roman Empire as it deals
with the city-states of northern Italy seem fascinating. Some of
these passages are either too long or too short, as they give
immensely complex detail without ever managing to make it gripping or
memorable. Equally, the style of English is often strangely wooden,
especially in the dialogue, although it is difficult to tell whether
this fault lies with the writing or with the translation.</TE>
<TE>   There is a vast amount of information and entertainment here and,
in the end, the reader capitulates to Eco's demands and wallows in it
as someone in the Middle Ages would have done: with all the critical
faculties shut down, simply relishing a good yarn.</TE>

<HD>The latitude and longitude of L.A. lit</HD>
<DH>Writing Los Angeles, A Literary Anthology, Edited by avid
L. Ulin, Library of America: 884 pp., $40</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Wasserman</AU>
<BD>Steve Wasserman is the editor of the Los Angeles Times
Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>America is, famously, the republic of reinvention, where peoples the
world over have sought an escape from history, a new identity in a
land of seemingly endless possibility. California, of course, is, as
Susan Sontag has remarked, "America's America," and Los Angeles has
for more than 100 years been a terminus, the destination of desire.
Despite its notorious reputation for making a fetish of the body and
eschewing the life of the mind, Los Angeles has been a magnet for
writers. Hometown for some, refuge for others, it is both a place and
a sensibility whose literature reflects a range of affection and
disdain among writers who have found here what Carey McWilliams
discovered more than half a century ago: a "curious amalgam of all
America, of all states, of all peoples and cultures of America."</LD>
<TE>   "Writing Los Angeles," edited by David L. Ulin and published by
the Library of America, is a nearly 900-page anthology that, like the
city it seeks to represent, is both multifaceted and immense. It
offers a panoramic view of a diverse and sprawling literary
landscape, featuring brief chronological selections from the work of
nearly 80 writers who have sought over the last century or so to make
sense of the astonishingly swift rise of the improbable megalopolis
Mike Davis memorably called the "city of quartz," bright, hard,
opaque. Ulin has done a masterful job of choosing some of the more
compelling efforts to evoke a city whose essence has proved
maddeningly elusive for most of the writers who found themselves
here. Ulin inclines toward many of the usual suspects, from Nathanael
West to Raymond Chandler and Joan Didion, who described Los Angeles
so vividly and successfully that their L.A. is by now so firmly
lodged in the frontal lobe of popular imagination that it is all but
impossible to experience the city as anything other than a battle of
cliches. Other familiar authors include John Fante, John Rechy,
Chester Himes, Christopher Isherwood, Ray Bradbury, Upton Sinclair,
Tom Wolfe, Reyner Banham, Gavin Lambert, Wanda Coleman, Carolyn See,
Walter Mosley, James Ellroy and D.J. Waldie. Ulin's compendium is not
comprehensive. How could it be? The literary history of Los Angeles
is too unruly and rich to be fully represented and enclosed
completely within the grid of its particular latitude and longitude.
To those he has left out -- both the living and the dead -- he offers
his regrets.</TE>
<TE>   There are at least two ways to read this Rosetta stone. One is to
test one's own experience of L.A. against the reactions of its
various writers, to assess where one agrees or disagrees, where they
seem to get it right and where they have got it wrong. A second more
suggestive (and challenging) approach is to imagine you are a reader
who has never visited or lived in L.A., whose only encounter with the
city is through the pages of this book, to treat it as if it were a
novel written by multiple authors. Read this way, it gives rise to
several questions: What is the tale that is told? What is the nature
of its main character -- the city itself? What changes does it
undergo over time? And what, if any, is the moral of the story?</TE>
<TE>   "Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears," Italo
Calvino wrote in "Invisible Cities." Nowhere is that more true than
in Los Angeles, a city whose very founding and survival rebuke the
notion that geography is fate. For, unlike other cities, Los Angeles
is entirely an act of will. It doesn't thrive at the confluence of
rivers, or at the mouth of a natural harbor, or in a verdant plain
made bountiful by plentiful rainfall. On the contrary, it is,
observes John McPhee, "a metropolis that exists in a semidesert,
imports water three hundred miles, has inveterate flash floods, is at
the grinding edges of two tectonic plates, and has a microclimate
tenacious of noxious oxides." To put it another way, Los Angeles has
no right to exist. And yet, against all odds, it does.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, its chief seduction was the obliteration of
the past, the manufacture of desire and the promise of redemption.
Its siren call was most clearly heard through movies, of course.
Movies made Los Angeles a virtual destination for people everywhere,
projecting images of both a glittering Arcadia and a dark underbelly
of anomie and murderous suffocation. But it wasn't only the movies,
as "Writing Los Angeles" reveals. Novelists and journalists played
their parts, by turns swept away, astonished and appalled by the
spectacle that was L.A. Land speculators, oil men, railroad tycoons,
religious cranks, hucksters and grifters of every stripe combined to
make of Los Angeles a beacon for ordinary Americans who sought to
liberate themselves from the stifling confinements and corruptions of
the industrial East, to flee the idiocies of the rural life and to
renew themselves in a sun-kissed land where they might yet stumble
upon the secret of life in their sunset years.</TE>
<TE>   No longer hostage to the past, these immigrants found themselves
in free fall. There was a kind of vertigo to the place. It was a land
of compulsive (and, it would appear, compulsory) reinvention. For
many -- Christopher Isherwood and David Hockney, for instance -- the
experience was intoxicating. No longer bound by the claustrophobic
class and sex constraints of their native England, they found L.A. to
be a city of exhilarating velocity and possibility. "Within a week of
arriving there in this strange big city," Hockney recalls, "not
knowing a soul, I'd passed the driving test, bought a car, driven to
Las Vegas and won some money, got myself a studio, started painting,
all in a week. And I thought, it's just how I imagined it would be."
By contrast, for many Germans, fleeing the Nazi conquest of Europe,
living in Los Angeles was, as Bertolt Brecht put it, an "exile in
paradise." In his bitter and brilliant Hollywood poem cycle, Brecht
is at pains to denounce the manifold hypocrisies of the place, the
terror lurking behind its shallow smiling exterior: "Alas, the lovely
garden, placed high above the coast / Is built on crumbling rock.
Landslides / Drag parts of it into the depths without warning." The
whole city sought to evade what Brecht called the "stink of greed and
poverty." He knew what many other writers had also discovered: Los
Angeles is a world unto itself -- a mythic city of both abundant
promise and tragic disappointment, a city precariously perched on the
edge of a continent, a golden mirage of Edenic prosperity which
barely conceals a darker edge, an apocalyptic fault line of class and
racial tension that splinters its subterranean vaults, threatening
its otherwise relentlessly sunny disposition with the specter of
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles, on the evidence provided by the authors in "Writing
Los Angeles," is a city that has yet to make up its mind about what
it wants to be when it grows up. The one thing it knows for certain
is that it wants to get there fast. What emerges in "Writing Los
Angeles" is a magical city of the imagination that is as complex,
dynamic and familiar as the real city of palm trees with "scrawny
fronds like broken pinwheels," in the words of Robert Towne who, like
others, remembers growing up with "the Santa Anas progressively
drying the city into sand and summer smells" and the "smell of pepper
trees mentholated more and more by eucalyptus." That more innocent
Los Angeles is largely gone, pulverized by the hammer wielded by the
present upon the past in its remorseless quest to make way for the
radiant future.</TE>
<TE>   No single anthology, however thoughtfully and artfully assembled
(as "Writing Los Angeles" surely is), can fully contain that drama.
This reader misses, for example, something of the spice of a number
of authors who have written about L.A. with wit and insight: Kate
Braverman ("Lithium for Medea"), David Rieff ("Los Angeles: Capital
of the Third World"), T.C. Boyle ("The Tortilla Curtain"), Sandro
Meallet ("Edgewater Angels"), Yxta Maya Murray ("Locas"), Norman
Klein ("The History of Forgetting: Los Angeles and the Erasure of
Memory"), Richard Rayner ("Los Angeles Without a Map"), Kem Nunn
("Pomona Queen"), Bret Easton Ellis ("Less Than Zero"), Hector Tobar
("The Tattooed Soldier"), Susan Straight ("Highwire Moon"), Bruce
Wagner ("I'll Let You Go"), virtually any of the novels of Michael
Connelly and Robert Crais, as well as extracts from the
autobiographical writings of Agnes De Mille, Arthur Miller and
Michael Korda. All such lists are inherently subjective, of course,
and every reader will have his or her own favorites. (Ulin himself a
year ago put a number of important contemporary L.A. writers into a
useful volume titled "Another City: Writing From Los Angeles,"
published by City Lights Books.) The best map to Los Angeles is the
one each reader creates by virtue of his or her own reading. In the
end, each of us is properly the cartographer of our own literary
discoveries. Nevertheless, Ulin is a trustworthy guide, and "Writing
Los Angeles" is an indispensable introduction to the literature of
Los Angeles. It by no means exhausts the subject.</TE>

<LD>Every history has its touchstone moments, events that seem to define
something essential about the broader narrative and that writers
return to every generation or so, seeking to create a "history for
our time." For Americans, the trials for witchcraft that took place
in Salem, Mass., in 1692 and resulted in 20 people being executed are
one such moment.</LD>
<LD>   Each era has had its Salem, from the archetypically 1950s vision
of McCarthyite oppression and sexual repression in Arthur Miller's
"The Crucible" to the perfectly 1960s argument of Chadwick Hansen's
"Witchcraft at Salem" that there were real witches in Salem, to Paul
Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum's 1974 vision of family feuds and power
politics in "Salem Possessed," to Carol Karlsen's 1987 feminist
account of the beliefs that led Puritans to see "The Devil in the
Shape of a Woman," to Bernard Rosenthal's relentlessly skeptical
"Salem Story," which, in 1992, exposed the accretion of myths that
had come to surround the actual records of the trials. Mary Beth
Norton's "In the Devil's Snare: The Salem Witchcraft Crisis of 1692"
not only gives us the freshest, and most detailed account of that
compelling crisis that we have had in a decade, but it is a hopeful
indication that American historiography has moved past the ruinous
culture wars of the 1980s and '90s.</LD>
<TE>   Norton is a professor of history at Cornell who was an early
advocate of studying women's history. Her interest led her to pay
more attention than anyone before her to the accusers in the Salem
trials, most of whom were girls, teenagers, or young women. By the
standards of the day, they should have been given the least credence
in a public hearing. Why, then, did the rules change in Salem? Norton
researched the accusers' family history and found a startling common
thread. Ten of them had strong ties to a section of what is now Maine
that was the epicenter of violent clashes between the New Englanders
and the Wabanacki people. Many of the accusers had personally
experienced scenes of horrifying death and destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The accusers were not the only ones whose behavior in Salem can be
traced to the Indian wars in the north. While other diligent writers
about Salem, such as Marilynne K. Roach in her new, valuable and
thoroughly researched day-by-day chronicle of "The Salem Witch
Trials," have discussed the Indian wars and related them to the
trials, Norton uncovered previously unexamined records of these
conflicts. Her close study of these sources -- as well as a host of
monographs, dissertations, and articles tracking the Wabanacki view
of these events -- reveals a sequence of bloody attacks, repeated
English failures and constant rumors of betrayal by high officials.</TE>
<TE>   New Englanders felt an ever-rising sense of fear as the enemy, the
most horrifyingly physical enemy possible -- angry Indians apparently
armed by traitors at home and egged on by French Catholics -- seemed
ever more potent. When young women in Salem began to show disturbing,
though not all that uncommon, signs of diabolical affliction, New
England felt it was being attacked on a second front. The demonic
enemies (often described as resembling Indians) and the physical ones
(often seen to be agents of the devil) were part of the same assault.
As we have seen in the past year, a nation under attack feels
justified in meting out harsh justice.</TE>
<TE>   After detailing the setbacks the New Englanders experienced in
Maine, Norton links these debacles directly to the judges in the
trials. If you know this history already, you see this story
unfolding early and have the delicious thrill of anticipating the
grand conclusion she will draw. If you do not, her final chapter,
"New Witch-Land," can read like the end of an Agatha Christie novel.
All of the suspects are assembled in the guise of august judges, and
then Norton reminds us of the failures in deaths, lost battles,
fumbled opportunities each left behind in Maine.</TE>
<TE>   In a colony that felt it was being judged by God, the leaders who
could most expect to have themselves called to account were in a
position to shift blame, to agree that Satan was present in the form
of witches, not botched military campaigns, and they eagerly did so.</TE>
<TE>   This insight is not a complete explanation of the trials. Norton
is diligent and evenhanded in showing that, like almost everyone in
New England, the judges believed in witches, that they correctly
applied English law as they understood it. Nineteen were hanged; one
was pressed to death by stones for refusing to make a plea -- normal
legal practice at the time -- and perhaps five, including two
infants, died in prison. Still, Norton has supplied a completely
novel way of explaining their behavior. It is this conceptual leap
that distinguishes Norton's book from Roach's useful, rigorous and
historiographically current reference work.</TE>
<TE>   There is one area, though, in which Norton's interest in taking
the accusers seriously, and laying proper blame on the judges'
conscious or unconscious defensiveness is not as successful. Like
Roach, her focus is on the trials as people experienced them at the
time, so she does not spend a great deal of attention on what has
often been seen as the central question: Were the accusers who had
fits in court, bled, displayed tooth marks and brought in props such
as pins and even a broken knife, consciously faking their behavior?
Or were they in some kind of altered psychological state in which
they believed their visions?</TE>
<TE>   Norton proclaims herself "agnostic" on the accusers, suspecting
that some were in a state perhaps similar to post-traumatic stress
due to seeing relatives slaughtered, while others over time may have
faked their symptoms. She thinks that witnesses who changed their
minds about their testimony "reevaluated" their experiences but
always believed what they said. But the records of the pretrial
hearings, which is most of the evidence about Salem, show instances
of people who did lie, and then precisely because of the threat to
their souls, recanted.</TE>
<TE>   While researching this book, Norton could, of course, not have
known of the terrorist attacks that were to come last year. And yet
the book she has written is perfectly suited to our nation as it was
transformed on that date. For by capturing how the experience of
horrible attacks transforms individual perception and alters the
legal process, she has shown us in a distant mirror. In 1692, as in
2002, the specter of the evil enemy can cause all familiar legal
processes and guarantees to be suspended. In a sense, though, she has
also accomplished the reverse. The Salem story she tells is not a
cautionary tale of hysterical lynch justice, as a simplistic and
ideologically driven account might be. Instead, she recaptures a
world in which the interactions, conflicts, fears, frictions of
whites and Indians and blacks, of men and women, of young people in
their teens and the adult leaders of New England produced the outcome
of the witch trials. The key to Puritan Salem lay in the history of
the Wabanacki. America, the mixed and intermixed, is also as much a
story of 1692 as it is of 2002. It is this second insight that makes
her book a landmark achievement. It may well herald a new golden age
of American history, in which the many strands of separate history
that academics have eagerly researched can be recombined to give us
new ways to understand the central moments in our past and thus the
nature of our present.</TE>

The History and People of Head Start."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Preserving memory is an act of hope for Winson Hudson of Harmony,
Miss. By telling her story, one of undaunted courage in the face of
Ku Klux Klan violence and indifference from some fellow blacks, she
hopes that young people will build on the efforts that she and others
made in their Mississippi hamlet over the last 50 years. They defied
gun-toting nightriders, hostile sheriffs and obstructionist
registrars to provide education for the children of their community,
secure voting rights and improve health care. She beseeches her black
neighbors to "hold onto the land." Land, and the food that could be
raised on it, have given Hudson and others the independence to
confront segregation in its many forms.</LD>
<TE>   "Mississippi Harmony: Memoirs of a Freedom Fighter," told with the
help of writer and activist Constance Curry, is a slender volume by a
stout-hearted woman who devoted her life to fighting racial
discrimination, serving from 1962 to 2001 as president of her
county's chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored
People. When Hudson was only 8, her mother died of inadequate medical
attention while giving birth. That death, and those of two sisters
and other relatives, later led Hudson to crusade for better health
care for poor people in general and blacks in particular. She
remembers that, not so long ago, black patients sat in separate
waiting rooms and saw doctors only when the physicians had seen all
their white patients. And that black people died en route to
hospitals 75 miles away because none closer to their homes would
admit them, even in emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the matter of the vote. Since 1890, Mississippi had
had a clause in its Constitution that prospective voters had to be
able to write a clause in the Constitution selected by the registrar,
then explain it. The registrar rejected many black Leake County
residents who were asked to interpret a 206-word provision explaining
the technical qualifications for voting, while whites had to
interpret this clause: "All elections shall be by ballot."</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Winson Hudson and her sister
Dovie repeatedly went to the courthouse to try to register to vote,
sometimes dodging hostile white onlookers. Always, they failed --
until they complained to the U.S. Department of Justice. With the
federal government's backing, the sisters returned to the courthouse.
Asked to interpret a section of the state Constitution, Hudson
replied: "It said what it meant and it meant what it said." The
sisters both registered successfully.</TE>
<TE>   Education has been another lifelong concern. Between 1913 and
1932, the Julius Rosenwald Fund helped black communities build 557
schools in Mississippi, none better, Hudson writes, than the one in
Harmony. Then came the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision outlawing
school segregation. In the ensuing years, the county school board
wanted to close the Harmony school rather than send white students
there. Harmony residents fought to keep their school, but NAACP
leaders wanted to eliminate segregated schools.</TE>
<TE>   But the state refused to desegregate. Hudson and others bravely
gathered signatures on a petition asking the federal courts to let
black children attend previously all-white schools. Local resistance
was also fierce, and nightriders shot into many Harmony homes. "Our
petition with the list of names was posted at the courthouse, and the
folks who worked for whites or lived on their land were forced to
take their names off," she writes. Of 52 who originally signed, all
but 13 dropped off. Still the petitioners won. They then scoured the
county for a black family willing to send a child to a white school.
Debra Lewis began school in Carthage, 13 miles away, in the fall of
1964, a decade after the Supreme Court decision.</TE>
<TE>   This history cannot be told too often. Too few young people know
the price paid so that they might attend school, get jobs, even have
telephones and drive on paved roads. But memory is more than history
-- it's also the glimpses of life in a small community hemmed in by
whites. For example, Hudson's father would not let her or any of her
sisters work in white people's homes because rape was a constant
fear. "When we did work away from home," she says, "you better
believe it was a bunch of us or some boys with us -- not by ourselves
-- at no time."</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, photographer Brian Lanker published a stunning book of
portraits of black women who changed America, "I Dream a World." In
that book featuring such prominent women as U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters
(D-Los Angeles), Oprah Winfrey, Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne
Braithwaite Burke and Children's Defense Fund founder Marian Wright
Edelman, there is only one photograph showing two women -- Winson and
Dovie Hudson (both married men named Hudson). They sit on
straight-backed chairs, hands in their laps, looking levelly at the
camera through large eyeglasses. They seem at peace. They did their
part, and far more.</TE>

<LD>Battle Rock: The Struggle Over a One-Room School in America's
Vanishing West, William Celis, Public Affairs: 221 pp., $25</LD>
<LD>   This story about a one-room schoolhouse in a Colorado canyon began
as an article in the New York Times. The Battle Rock School was
founded in 1915 and for almost 80 years most of the students were
cousins, brothers and sisters. In the 1990s, this changed
dramatically (according to Celis, 5.2 million Americans in urban
areas moved to the country). There was also an increase in the number
of one-room schoolhouses, but the mix of relatively wealthy urban
kids and locals proved toxic, at least in McElmo Canyon at Battle
Rock School.</LD>
<LD>   Parents fought over everything from indoor (modernized) toilets
versus outhouses (the way it had always been) to a picture in a
reference book of Botticelli's Venus, which caused many of the locals
to take their kids out of the school. Celis spent a school year
living in nearby Cortez and attending the school, where the students,
grades one through six, were taught by 40-year-old Stephen Hanson. In
the end, a reader sees the arguments over education in the 20-student
school from both sides, but, ultimately, his sympathies lie with the
locals.</LD>
<TE>   Zipping My Fly: Moments in the Life, of an American Sportsman,
Rick Tosches, Perigree/Penguin: 245 pp., $19.95</TE>
<TE>   A $6,875 trip to New Zealand to write a 10,500-word article on
fly-fishing, Rick Tosches explains, had "a lot to do with why I don't
work for the Los Angeles Times anymore." Tosches is a weeper; his
humor is an explosive mix of Dave Sedaris and Dave Barry, as he
tries, in several essays, to do justice to the absurdity of
fly-fishing, (the sport, Tosches reminds us, that is often referred
to as "a jerk on one end of a line waiting for a jerk on the other),
from Alaska to New Zealand to the World Fly-Fishing Championship in
Jackson Hole, Wyo. Turns out he wasn't too upset about leaving L.A.
for Colorado. Not enough water in a city where everything is paved,
with the exception of "the ocean, which the City of Los Angeles could
not pave because, as I understand it, Johnny Carson owns it." And so
it goes. Even the chapter titles poke fun at the sanctimonious
eggheads of this world: "The Drivel Runs Through It," "Dances With
Morons." There's a fair share of little boy humor as well, on the
favored subjects of nose-blowing, farting and drinking, but even
these can get you going. Fishing with a hangover, Tosches' friend
keeps shouting at the flies, "Jesus Christ, do they have to beat
their wings on the water like that?"</TE>
<TE>   Letters on Cezanne: Rainer Maria Rilke, Translated from the German
by Joel Agee, Edited by Clara Rilke, North Point Press: 84 pp., $13</TE>
<TE>   Joel Agee, translator of this volume of little-known essays on the
many ways that Cezanne's paintings inspired the poet, admits in his
foreword that there are places in these essays where Rainer Maria
Rilke's "love of precision seems to have abandoned him." There are
places in "Letters on Cezanne" where Rilke struggles to absorb "that
balance between the reality of nature and the reality of the image
which was Cezanne's entire striving."</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of 1907, a year after the painter died, Rilke went
every day to the Salon d'Automne to sit in a room filled with
Cezannes. "You can feel," he wrote, "what a light green carriage can
be on the Pont-Neuf or some red that can't contain itself, or simply
a poster on the fire wall of a pearl-grey group of houses." He
admires Cezanne's "plainspoken truth," his deference to the power of
color. Cezanne could make "saints" out of an apple or a bottle of
wine "and forces-forces them to be beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   The writing is clearly inspired, almost breathless: "Avenues," he
wrote stepping out into the streets of Paris, "flowing toward you in
a scarcely perceptible downward slope, fast and rich and like a
river.... And all of this lies out there with the generosity of a
born landscape, and casts forth space."</TE>

<LD>Instant Karma, Mark Swartz, City Lights: 136 pp, $11.95 paper</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to the oddball world of David Felsenstein, a Chicago loner
who's part Young Werther, part Travis Bickle and part post-adolescent
Borges. David is a self-described "biblioclast" who roams the Harold
Washington Public Library pondering the subtle differences between
collecting and borrowing, and his flitting observations are ably
presented by Mark Swartz as the first-person scrapbook of a
disjointed mind: David's diary includes reflections -- quite amusing,
mostly -- on everything from Sartre (only college boys read him) to
the film "1941" (Belushi was awesome); references to Joyce, Buddhism
and an obscure lesbian alcoholic Communist actress; asides on how to
stir-fry fish heads; and frequent tangents on Eve Jablom, the foxy
librarian. Ah, young bookworms in love, you might suspect. Not quite.
When David isn't sniffing out musty arcana and trying to catch Eve's
eye, he's out setting fire to American flags and plotting to blow his
beloved library -- and tortured self -- to smithereens.</LD>
<TE>   "Instant Karma" is a kind of Dewey Decimal tribute to Paul
Auster's "Leviathan." Its would-be terrorist is, like Auster's mad
bomber, a romantic flake, not some insidious fundamentalist. It's a
quaintly reassuring perspective, and this curious book manages to be
a page-turner despite its hackneyed, postmodern contrivances. What
we're left with, weirdly, is an essentially harmless tale about a
raging psycho.</TE>
<TE>   The Justification of Johann Gutenberg, Blake Morrison,
HarperCollins: 272 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   JOHANN Gutenberg, ne Gensfleisch (Gooseflesh), the creator of the
printing press, the greatest invention since the wheel, is the
subject of this engaging first novel from Blake Morrison, a veteran
British poet and editor. It's an appropriately dazzling saga that
evokes the exceedingly human inventor of a heretical machine that, in
its time, seemed no less than a challenge to God himself. This
"justification," as Gutenberg tells us, is an effort to "wash my inky
linen in public," and what follows is an old man's recollections of
his journeyman life: growing up in a thriving, upper-class house in
Mainz, a scholarly boy drawn, inexplicably, to lowlier trades. Most
of his young life is spent roving the continent, working as an
apprentice for this guild and that, frequenting the soothing ladies
of the bathhouses and slowly nurturing a radical idea inspired by
witnessing a wine press at work (in vino veritas, indeed). Every page
of Morrison's life of Gutenberg is stamped with startling
observations: from the trivia that 15th century ink was made from oak
apples to the grisly ratio of cow carcasses to sheets of vellum. The
sum is magic, but there's no abracadabra here, just a wonderfully
flawed and conniving guy who "invented a thing more explosive than
gunpowder."</TE>
<TE>   Disturbance of the Inner Ear, Joyce Hackett, Carroll &amp; Graf: 288
pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   An ultra-rare cello from the 1560s; 77-year old Signor Perso, dead
in a Milan hotel room; Giulio Salvagente, a well-heeled Milanese
plastic surgeon and, it turns out, gigolo; Clayton Pettyward, a
14-year-old who eats dog biscuits and happens to be the spoiled son
of an American diplomat; and, finally, the wayward American Isabel
Masurovsky, former cello prodigy and daughter of a Jewish pianist who
survived the Theresienstadt concentration camp in Czechoslovakia by
playing for the Nazis. Isabel is at the heart of Joyce Hackett's
fractured and dissonant symphony of a novel, with its hypnotic themes
of survival, betrayal and exile. Discovering just how out-there the
Old World can be, Isabel is the one in possession of the cello, the
former lover of the late Signor Perso, the current obsession of the
thoroughly creepy Giulio and the long-suffering teacher of the
musically challenged Clayton.</TE>
<TE>   Line by line, Hackett's ear is impressive. But her multilayered
enterprise never quite stacks up, and its mad-dash final movement, in
which Isabel races to Theresienstadt in a stolen Alfa Romeo, is
ultimately, like this impressive yet flawed novel, as baffling as it
is affecting.</TE>

<HD>To the rescue?</HD>
<DH>Summoned at the last minute, script doctors can come off as
superheroes -- or, just as likely, supervillains. The Writers Guild
is bitterly divided as it considers new rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rachel Abramowitz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was just two weeks before the start of principal photography for
"Bad Boys 2," the sequel to the Will Smith-Martin Lawrence cop
comedy, and its director, Michael Bay, was already in Miami prepping
for the car chases and explosions he planned to unleash across the
causeways of America's southern hot spot. As the August start date
loomed, there was one small hitch in this fast-hatching big-budget
extravaganza: Smith hadn't signed on to do the movie yet. He had a
little issue with the script.</LD>
<LD>   So the studio, Columbia, and the producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, did
what they do at times like these: They called in the specialists, the
high-priced script doctors meant to breathe life into dying scripts.
Studios and producers are willing to pay -- $200,000 to $300,000 a
week for Oscar winners or nominees and others considered to be in the
top echelon of the business -- for those who can furiously tap out
pages in as short a time as possible.</LD>
<TE>   It was John Lee Hancock, a charming Texan who'd just made his
directorial debut with the critical and commercial hit "The Rookie,"
who got the call from Columbia studio chief Amy Pascal. Hancock,
who'd worked on a King Arthur project for Bruckheimer, had a few
weeks to kill while he waited to see if Disney was going to
greenlight his next directorial effort, "The Alamo." Within days, he
was meeting with the various executives, talking to Bay and
Bruckheimer and, ultimately, selling Smith on the script, which had
already gone through the typewriters of a bevy of writers, among them
writer-director Ron Shelton and "Permanent Midnight"
author-screenwriter Jerry Stahl.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock, who's best known for an earnest but unsentimental
Americana, isn't the first writer one would think of to pen a
sarcastic urban comedy. "I'm not known as funny," he admits with a
chuckle, but his task here was to make the script less simplistic.
Feverishly sending in pages as soon as they popped out of his
printer, he added subplots and gave each protagonist a secret.</TE>
<TE>   "We added more conflict. Will and Martin are terrifically funny,
but you can't just count on sticking them in a car and they'll be
funny. You need to set them up," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a really different kind of writing because time is so of the
essence," he adds. "You have to have a little of a gunslinger
attitude. 'I'm coming to town and I'm killing the bad guys and then
I'll leave and I won't take any of your women.' You can't upset the
apple cart of production."</TE>
<TE>   A practice almost as old as Hollywood itself, script doctoring
remains a controversial craft, one that seems to grow more common by
the minute, as Hollywood more and more cedes original filmmaking to
the indies and concentrates on its true metier: the creation of
blockbusters for which the single vision is a corporate one.</TE>
<TE>   Writers often are disinclined to admit publicly what they have
worked on, either out of the honor of letting the credited writer
keep the credit or out of the shame of having slummed on some
misbegotten juggernaut. There also is still widespread sentiment that
the best scripts spring from the head of a single writer and that
writer pile-on is often evidence of a movie's being in an
increasingly desperate search for characters, plot and dialogue. It's
moviemaking at its most relentlessly commercial, offering a seductive
payday to writers who put aside original work to help realize flashy
concepts that have been jammed into production to meet summer release
dates.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, script doctoring touches on one of the longest-running
arguments in Hollywood: Is development a force for good, refining
scripts into shiny masterpieces, or the worst thing that ever
happened to movies, a process by which any hint of originality is
carefully leeched away, leaving bland, homogenized films already
forgotten by the time the audience reaches the parking lot?</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood writers' union is in the midst of a rapidly evolving
public quarrel over the issue of screenwriting credits, and nothing
illustrates the perennial tension between the profession's haves and
have-nots as starkly as script doctoring. Although the practice can
easily slide into wholesale rewriting, the term generally refers to
the chosen few who are engaged in production polishes and who are
mostly paid on a weekly retainer while a film is either shooting or
about to shoot. Sometimes they're hired to salvage an unworkable mess
or aid a director's vision, but they're also enlisted to pacify stars
who want to put their imprint on the material, to mediate between
warring parties or simply to settle queasy studio executives nervous
about the latest $100-million opus.</TE>
<TE>   Laments a top literary agent, "It's almost become more of a
psychological crutch for the studio executive than anything else. In
order to justify the enormous cost of production, you have to hire a
seasoned, professional rewrite god to make you feel comfortable about
the [expenditure]. It's maybe the worst money spent in Hollywood. It
has everything to do with insecurity and nothing to do with product."</TE>
<TE>   Bruckheimer is different from most producers because he's so
cheerfully upfront about his industrial approach to script
construction. He often hires his own equivalent of the New York
Yankees to work on each script, at a total cost of "a couple of
million bucks or more."</TE>
<TE>   Hancock left after three weeks to start working on "The Alamo," to
be replaced first by comedy writer Judd Apatow ("Freaks and Geeks")
and finally by the team of Brian Koppelman and David Levien
("Rounders"). As Lawrence and Smith rehearsed over a weekend, the
writers would take down their ad-libs and reconfigure them into
scripted dialogue by Monday. "Each writer has a very specific thing
to do," Bruckheimer says. "It's specific work, not reinventing the
plot."</TE>
<TE>   The list of A-list writers who have happily and lucratively toiled
in the Bruckheimer camp is long and illustrious and includes "West
Wing" creator Aaron Sorkin, as well as such Oscar winners as Robert
Towne ("Chinatown"), Steven Zaillian ("Schindler's List") and Quentin
Tarantino ("Pulp Fiction"), the final three of whom graced the
submarine movie "Crimson Tide."</TE>
<TE>   The process happens to varying degrees on most studio "tent pole"
films, from the 32 writers who contributed to "The Flintstones,"
perhaps the most notorious writer pile-up of the last decade, to the
17 on "Charlie's Angels" to this summer's spectacle "Spider-Man."
That film featured a rare solo writing credit for David Koepp, and
uncredited writing primarily by Oscar winner Alvin Sargent ("Ordinary
People") and a smidgen by "Con Air's" Scott Rosenberg, who cheerfully
admits that most of his work, "a kind of 'Bonfire of the Vanities'
approach," was left out of the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg was also the ninth of nine writers on "Armageddon."
"When the budget so big, why not? If you just get four to five good
jokes or good scenes, that can be worth it. I don't think you'd do it
on 'The English Patient.' "</TE>
<TE>   Although most script doctors sharply distinguish between their
original work and their gun-for-hire fare, many admit that a
doctoring stint can be not only lucrative but also ego-gratifying.</TE>
<TE>   "I really enjoy doing them," says Paul Attanasio, the writer of
such brainy fare as the Oscar-nominated "Quiz Show," who has
moonlighted on dozens of popcorn movies, which he declines to name
(although it's well known that "Air Force One" and "Patch Adams" are
among them). "I basically analogize it to being the closer in
baseball. There's something about the nature of that kind of
pressure, where you're coming in at the ninth inning and throwing
your fastball to three batters and leaving, that's exhilarating.</TE>
<TE>   "The beauty of being a script doctor," Rosenberg says, "is: If the
movie's a success, you feel like you were part of it. If it fails,
you feel relatively unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   "My rule of thumb is when it's that kind of movie, I understand my
place. I never get my feelings hurt. They're giving me a nice
paycheck, and while you have to find what's resonant with you in the
story, it's not like it's the story of my ancestors coming over from
the old country."</TE>
<TE>   "I guess people could take this the wrong way," says Lowell Ganz,
who with partner Babaloo Mandel is among the most sought-after comedy
doctors in town. "We try very hard [at script-doctoring jobs], but
there's a lower level of stress than when we're doing a script that's
our baby." Ganz and Mandel's credited work includes "A League of
Their Own"; according to sources, their uncredited doctoring jobs
include "Liar Liar."</TE>
<TE>   Top writers can cash in</TE>
<TE>   For a writer, script doctoring can be one of the perks of stardom,
similar to top athletes' cashing in on endorsements. And almost every
top screenwriter dabbles in it. Sometimes they even rewrite one
another. These days, at the top of the list are such notables as
Zaillian, Ganz and Mandel, Eric Roth ("Forrest Gump"), John August
("Charlie's Angels"), Richard LaGravenese ("The Fisher King") and
Scott Frank ("Minority Report"). It's a mostly male cadre, with the
notable exceptions of Oscar nominee Susannah Grant ("Erin
Brockovich") and Oscar winner Callie Khouri ("Thelma &amp; Louise").</TE>
<TE>   Script doctoring gives some writers in town a kind of double life.
While indie director John Sayles is celebrated for the integrity of
such films as "Lone Star" and "Matewan," he also is a prolific script
doctor, having polished everything from "Apollo 13" to "The Quick and
the Dead." Although few Oscar-nominated projects bear the
fingerprints of script doctors, there are exceptions. Frank, a
favorite of DreamWorks, polished "Saving Private Ryan," and Tom
Stoppard shared the Oscar with original writer Marc Norman for the
work he did (technically more of a rewrite than a doctor gig) on
"Shakespeare in Love."</TE>
<TE>   One of this year's prestige films, "Road to Perdition," boasts a
sole writing credit by David Self and uncredited writing by at least
three others, two of whom worked simultaneously. The upcoming "Gangs
of New York" credits the screenplay to Jay Cocks (the original
writer), Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan ("You Can Count on Me"), who
spent months on the set in Italy toiling on lines with director
Martin Scorsese and the actors. Prestige projects tend to generate
the most vicious credit battles, the process by which three anonymous
arbiters at the Writers Guild decide whose name goes on the movie. (A
second writer must contribute more than 50% of the work on an
original, or 33% of the work on an adaptation, to receive credit.)
According to the guild, about 30% of films wind up in credit
arbitration, and a writer must earn official screen credit to merit
either a production bonus (which can run into the millions) or
residuals, which can provide lifetime annuities, if you happened to
write "Jurassic Park."</TE>
<TE>   Because bonuses are tied to credit, many argue that there's
incentive for rewriters to cannibalize one another's work. Yet in
arbitration, the guild has historically favored the first writer,
particularly for original screenplays.</TE>
<TE>   Rewriting is the guild's thorniest issue, touching on the most
salient reason writers have so little power in Hollywood: They're
eminently fire-able, replaced as easily as a box of tissues. One
Oscar winner refused to talk about his doctoring, saying the practice
just underscored the weakness of all writers.</TE>
<TE>   Still some writers complain that the Writers Guild is the
only union in the country that has institutionalized a form of scabbing.
To one guild faction, script doctors exemplify the worst perversion
of the system, in which fat cats in Mercedes-Benzes steal money and
prestige from starving writers who have labored for years on their
scripts.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the most working writers have done rewrites, and even
A-listers know the sting of being replaced, though big paychecks do
seem to soften the humiliation. "It all depends how thick your skin
is," Rosenberg says. "There's always a horrible feeling when they
announce, 'We're going to bring somebody else in.' But I always
remind myself how blessed I am to be getting paid to do something I
love."</TE>
<TE>   It's a dog-eat-dog system, so why shouldn't rewriters just ask for
credit, asks writer-director Henry Bean, who has penned originals and
doctored such projects as "Enemy of the State." "The Writers Guild
will not protect writers in terms of getting rewritten, so as a sop
to them, in compensation, they give them full credit when they don't
deserve it. It's a form of legalized plagiarism, as far as I'm
concerned."</TE>
<TE>   One A-list script surgeon adds, "We make a lot of money and a lot
of people hate us, but a lot of movies wouldn't get made without
script doctors." Feelings on the issue are running high because the
Writers Guild is reviewing its process for awarding credits. ,
Recently, it distributed four proposed changes to the credit manual
that writers will vote on in November. One proposal would make it
easier for later writers of adaptations to get credit, and another
would make it easier for directors or producers who write to get
credit.</TE>
<TE>   "The stature of writers would be enhanced if we had one writer per
film," says Steven Schiff, the co-chairman of the Writers Guild's
credit review committee. "It would be nice if everyone who was asked
to do rewrites just refused, but it's a pipe dream. You're never
going to get people across the board to turn down work, comfort,
money, glory and fun."</TE>
<TE>   Famous screenplays</TE>
<TE>   In the annals of script doctoring, the most famous example of
exquisite laser surgery is the key scene that Oscar winner and
screenwriting legend Towne contributed to "The Godfather." Towne
wrote the moment when Don Corleone passes the torch of power to his
son Michael, played by Al Pacino. In what is a tacit declaration of
love, Corleone confesses, "I never wanted this for you, Michael."</TE>
<TE>   According to Peter Biskind's chronicle of filmmaking in the '70s,
"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls," Francis Ford Coppola paid Towne only
$3,000 for his effort. When the director asked if he wanted credit,
Towne joked, "Don't be ridiculous. I only wrote a couple of ...
scenes. If you win an Oscar, thank me." Coppola did.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the '70s, Towne was profligate with his talent, helping
on such projects as "Bonnie and Clyde" and, according to legend, "The
Parallax View." It's perhaps a sign of the times that today he is
better known for being Tom Cruise's rewriter of choice, having
contributed (and received credit) on such films as "The Firm" and
"Mission: Impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Though today's script doctors certainly seem to be willing to pick
up their pens to help out their friends (or luminaries such as Steven
Spielberg), a certain mercenary spirit pervades the air. "Now it's
much more about money," says Buck Henry, best known for writing "The
Graduate," although more recently he script-doctored "Town and
Country." "There are many, many ways to make money if you're a
credited writer, with all the ancillary stuff." Indeed, the explosion
of video, DVD and the foreign markets has significantly increased
residuals received by credited writers.</TE>
<TE>   "When I come in and rewrite, I do it for one reason only: the
money," says one top screenwriter, who chooses to remain anonymous.
"It buys me time on projects I care about." Of course, there are
always accusations floating around town that certain high-priced
doctors phone in their gun-for-hire pages. "I've had movies where
they have brought in other writers who are big, pimpy writers whose
names would blow you away," Rosenberg says. "Then you read their
drafts and they're just ghastly. It's about $250,000 a week, and they
don't [care]. It can be like beer money to them."</TE>
<TE>   Some writers pointedly don't ask for credit on scripts they've
polished.</TE>
<TE>   Grant has never asked for credit on the handful of films she's
doctored (which sources say include this past summer's "Unfaithful").
"If you're just coming in to work with the director or star, and
you're just trying to help them realize their interpretation of a
preexisting script, then to me that doesn't feel like authorship."</TE>
<TE>   "The whole point of being a script doctor is not to talk about
it," Attanasio says. "I don't pursue credit because I don't think
it's right. Some other guy has worked on the script for two or three
years of heavy lifting. You're coming in to help out but not to steal
somebody's credit."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, many writers ask for credit whenever they can. The line
between script doctoring and script overhaul can be extremely fuzzy,
and many writers feel justified in asking to be paid fully for their
effort.</TE>
<TE>   "By and large, the scripts I see that are proposed for rewriting
are pretty pathetic. You don't feel that there's much to be saved,"
Bean says. "Sometimes there's an intriguing concept and that's it. I
don't have much loyalty to the original writer. My whole job here is
to make movies good. We're putting out the basic narrative form that
is consumed by most people in this culture. We have to be responsible
to that, not to some writer with a commercial concept but without the
patience to develop it."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the sheer lucrative nature of script doctoring can be
corrosive, drawing the best minds away from generating exciting,
original material. For the top writers, the road to hackdom can be
paved with action-adventure blockbusters.</TE>
<TE>   John Lee Hancock will script-doctor only occasionally. "You have
to be careful of the velvet rut," he says. "You can make more money
doing weekly production rewrites than writing or directing movies.
But at some point, all you're doing is taking others' original ideas
and bending them and shaping them. You have to be careful because you
can lose your own original voice."</TE>

<HD>Hark, the herald angels sell (for a good cause)</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The "Angel of Love, Light and Giving" twinkled with a thousand
pinpoints of fiber-optic light; another angel titled "Stara" (old
star) reflected light off its mosaic surface of glass, metallic paint
and Mylar. There were angels created by the casts and crews of the TV
shows "The Practice" and "The West Wing"; an angel by Brigid LaBonge
decorated with photos of L.A. neighborhoods shot by her husband,
Councilman Tom LaBonge; a Laker Angel in a team jersey with images of
the 2001-02 team on its wings.</LD>
<LD>   These angels and more were for sale last Saturday on downtown's
Music Center Plaza as part of A Community of Angels, a public art
project that benefits youth programs.</LD>
<LD>   Now in its second year, A Community of Angels places the 69
fiberglass angels, each approximately 6 feet tall and decorated by
local artists, throughout Los Angeles for several months, then
auctions them for charity.</LD>
<TE>   Between 500 and 600 people, clutching little plates of hors
d'oeuvres and auction paddles, roamed the plaza in search of the
perfect angel.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd included angel artists, former Police Chief Bernard
Parks, Music Center President Joanne Kozberg and the tiara-ed Tiffany
Liu and Tina Huang, Miss L.A. Chinatown and that neighborhood's
Fourth Princess.</TE>
<TE>   Although the auctioneer begged for $100,000 to $200,000, most of
the 21 angels sold for $4,000 to $6,000. The auction raised about
$104,000, but is expected to raise more when the leftover angels are
sold via EBay and other Internet outlets. Last year's auction and
after-sale raised $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   The angel netting Saturday's highest bid -- $9,000 -- was artist
Janine Anderson's "Children's Reading Angel." It was purchased by
Barbara Lazaroff, wife and partner of restaurateur Wolfgang Puck. The
sculpture, whose wings are lined with shelves of real books, also
contains Councilman LaBonge's library card, impulsively donated to
the project. (No word on whether he has since been issued a new one.)</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Lazaroff purchased an angel fashioned after the Tin Man
of "The Wizard of Oz."</TE>
<TE>   It now stands in her yard, along with a theme-appropriate yellow
brick road. Lazaroff's latest purchase will not take up residence
next to the Tin Man, but will instead be donated to the private
school her 7-year-old son attends.</TE>

<HD>Autry rides 'Surf Culture' wave</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The endless summer is over in Orange Country -- that is, the Laguna
Art Museum's big surfing show is done -- but a similar swell is
rolling toward the usually landlocked Autry Museum of Western
Heritage in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The Laguna museum show, "Surf Culture: The Art History of
Surfing," ran from late July through Oct. 6 amid blockbuster
treatment, from extended museum hours to boosted prices. One critic
called the show "profoundly confused and poorly presented." Another
labeled it "a rambling, overstuffed extravaganza." But attendance
broke records. Museum director Bolton Colburn, who had hoped for
6,000 paid admissions, said the actual figure reached 11,000, with
total attendance of about 22,000.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Autry offers "Ocean View: The Depictions of South
California Coastal Lifestyle" from Nov. 23 to July 27. The museum
won't be changing its hours (10 a.m.-5 p.m., Tuesday-Sunday, and 10
a.m.-8 p.m., Thursday) or prices ($7.50 for adults), but the
exhibition will explore many of the same themes that the Laguna show
did, from the deeper significance of Gidget to the aesthetic
influences of surfboard design and surf-related advertising.</LD>
<TE>   "Ocean View" is a revival of a show first assembled for the UC
Riverside/California Museum of Photography in 1997. Autry spokesman
Jay Aldrich said the museum picked up the show to offer "something a
little different" following the long run of "Art of the Charreria."</TE>

<LD>Postwar exuberance coupled with Cold War fear produced a
schizophrenic blast of art and design in mid-20th century America.
Amoeboid paintings, kidney-shaped tables and tail-finned cars invoke
a spirit of freedom, while camouflage ponchos and coffee sets
decorated with atomic motifs recall an era when ordinary folks built
bomb shelters in their backyards. If there's a single aesthetic
symbol of the period, it's an ambivalent blob.</LD>
<LD>   That's the gist of "Vital Forms: American Art in the Atomic Age,
1940-1960," a provocative traveling exhibition that was scheduled to
appear at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from Nov. 17 to Feb.
23.</LD>
<LD>   But you won't see it on Wilshire Boulevard. The show was quietly
canceled a few months ago and booked into the San Diego Museum of
Art, where it opened on Saturday and will continue to Jan. 26.</LD>
<TE>   The problem? Too many exhibitions and too little space. Not to
mention money.</TE>
<TE>   "Munakata Shiko (1903-1975): Modern Master of the Japanese Print"
had to be moved up four months to accommodate lenders, LACMA press
officer Bo Smith said. Organized by LACMA, the Philadelphia Museum of
Art and the Planning Committee for the Munakata Shiko Centennial
Exhibition, that show has been rescheduled for Dec. 5 to March 2.
Compounding the space crunch, Smith said, is a small exhibition from
the museum's collection, organized to complement the "Lansdowne"
portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart, which will appear at
LACMA from Nov. 8 to March 9 on a tour from the National Portrait
Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   When push came to shove, officials opted for the relatively
inexpensive LACMA-organized shows and dropped "Vital Forms," a
pricier import from the Brooklyn Museum of Art.</TE>

<LD>Capt. Shotover, a leading character in Shaw's "Heartbreak House," is
88 years old. So when Stephen Tobolowsky was asked to stage the play
for Theatre 40 in Beverly Hills, he began surveying the ranks of
older actors.</LD>
<LD>   The first one he found would have been "wonderful," he said, but
the actor was then diagnosed with congestive heart failure.
Tobolowsky contacted 25 other 70-plus actors, and at least two were
cast at one point -- but then withdrew.</LD>
<LD>   "There had to be five actors who turned me down who were just
about to go into surgery," Tobolowsky said.</LD>
<TE>   When the final actor pulled out -- for reasons unrelated to health
-- on Oct. 7, five days before the scheduled (and already
once-postponed) opening, Tobolowsky knew of no one other than himself
who knew the lines. So he took over the role -- even though he's only
51. He rehearsed for two days, took off a day to work on a TV job,
then performed one preview on Oct. 11 and opened in the
three-hour-plus play on Oct. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Tobolowsky received a Tony nomination this year for "Morning's at
Seven," in the role of a 41-year-old. He'll repeat the role at the
Ahmanson Theatre this year, wearing a wig "that makes me look
boyish," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For "Heartbreak House," he applied "the spray high school kids put
in their hair when they play the adults in 'Our Town' " and a fake
beard. His wife, Ann Hearn, is playing his character's daughter --
which was a little awkward, he said. Indeed, the experience "is right
up there in the high-stress, low-reward theater events of my life."
However, "it's such a brilliant part, I hope to do it again when I
age."</TE>

<LD>Six years ago, Nick DeGruccio was an actor who never had considered
directing. Now he is a rising notable, nominated in both of the
Ovation Awards' directing categories -- for a play ("The Laramie
Project") and a musical ("Side Show"), both staged at his longtime
home base, the Colony Theatre Company in Burbank. At 41, he is making
his directorial debut for an established regional theater, overseeing
the West Coast premiere of the musical "The Spitfire Grill," which
runs Saturday-Dec. 1 at the Laguna Playhouse.</LD>
<LD>   How does knowing that more people will see "The Spitfire Grill"
than any show you've directed affect your approach?</LD>
<LD>   DeGruccio: It doesn't at all. I serve the play as I know how. I
don't think of how many people will see it.</LD>
<TE>   Besides directing a drama, two musicals and a concert version of
"How Now, Dow Jones" this year, you played Snoopy in "You're a Good
Man, Charlie Brown." That's pretty wide-ranging.</TE>
<TE>   DeGruccio: I live for the extremes of this business and letting
your imagination go wild. You can go from something so special and
amazing as "The Laramie Project" to playing everybody's favorite dog.</TE>
<TE>   East Coast critics have complained that the musical adaptation of
"The Spitfire Grill" lost the darkness and complexity that tinged the
original film drama.</TE>
<TE>   DeGruccio: I understand what they're saying, because the movie is
definitely darker. I can only assume it was changed to make it more
accessible. But a good musical is a good musical, regardless whether
it is dark or challenging. We're going with the script, of course,
but we're mining every possible event or character flaw to explore
the darker possibilities. It's a story of redemption and healing, and
I just love the lost-lives-reclaimed thing.</TE>
<TE>   Have you been daydreaming about winning both best director
Ovations on Nov. 24?</TE>
<TE>   DeGruccio: Sure, you sit there and formulate how you think it's
going to go, you play out the scenes. Both casts are coming with me;
it's mostly to celebrate the incredible year we've had together. You
try to be really cool -- "It's just awards" -- and of course, you're
ecstatic.</TE>

<LD>'O my youth! It is you that is being buried.'</LD>
<LD>   -- Rodolphe</LD>
<LD>   In Louis-Henri Murger's Scenes of Bohemian Life,</LD>
<TE>   the basis of Puccini's La Boheme</TE>
<TE>   New York</TE>
<TE>   Agentle summer rain washes the streets of downtown Manhattan,
glancing off the windows of a fourth-floor rehearsal studio in a
corner building on lower Broadway. Seen from inside, the misty
downfall becomes a diaphanous shroud, blurring the Saturday afternoon
scene unfolding below into the timeless surrealism of a French film.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the studio, a dozen singers sit in a circle -- reading
sections of libretto, vocalizing phrases, laughing and chatting as
they seek to uncover the deeper meanings in Giacomo Puccini's "La
Boheme." The drizzly haze at the windows might well be a time warp,
for they're probing text and music in much the same way as have
countless sopranos, tenors, baritones and basses before them for more
than 100 years, since the opera premiered in 1896. The bohemian life
it celebrates is also a perennial: the passions, the jealousies, the
overwrought poems, the overdue bills.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all that is eternal in this scene of artistic endeavor,
there are clues that make it clear that this is the 21st century.
There's a video camera recording the process, for instance, and
high-tech and lighting equipment around the room. Most of all, there
is the fact that the man in charge is film director Baz Luhrmann.</TE>
<TE>   Luhrmann's production of "La Boheme" is one of the most highly
anticipated stage events of the Broadway season, as well as the
Australian director's first U.S. theatrical outing. Now running at
the Curran Theatre in San Francisco -- where local reviewers have
been overwhelmingly positive in their reception -- "La Boheme" will
open at the Broadway Theatre in New York in early December after
starting previews slightly later than planned. "La Boheme" will be
the first test of whether Luhrmann can resume the success of his
earlier Australian stage career here, and it may affect the
positioning of the live division of his production company, Bazmark
Inc., which is developing new stage versions of his films "Strictly
Ballroom" and "Moulin Rouge." What's more, if the experiment works,
it would be a shot in the arm for opera, which could always use
another vehicle for mainstream crossover.</TE>
<TE>   Updated to 1957 Paris, sung in Italian with English subtitles and
cast with a retinue of photogenic young performers, this "La Boheme"
is intended to bring new audiences to this staple of the repertoire.
Yet apart from a younger cast, the use of microphones and other sound
equipment, and a reduced orchestra in the pit, Luhrmann is doing "La
Boheme" straight up, much as it would be done in an opera house.
They're no outrageous concepts here, no postmodern deconstructions of
the form. Although the trademark "L'amour" sign appears in "Moulin
Rouge" and here as well, it's a long way from the cheeky insurrection
of his last movie. And it's sure to confound anyone looking for the
flashy sensory overload of "Moulin Rouge," with its coked-out take on
1899 Paris and grab-bag pop-rock soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   Although the $6.5-million-to-$7-million budget may seem small
compared with the $50 million spent on "Moulin Rouge," there are
risks inherent in bringing Italian opera to Broadway. Most obviously,
it risks not satisfying the demands of regular theater- or
operagoers, let alone Luhrmann devotees. "There are quicker ways to
make money and gain success, let me tell you," the director says.
"It's not a clever career move particularly. We're doing this for
very personal reasons."</TE>
<TE>   It's no mystery why the man who made "Moulin Rouge," with its band
of bohemians and a starving writer protagonist in an Orpheus-like
plot, would be drawn to the garret dwellers of "La Boheme." Puccini's
bohemians may even have helped inspire the characters in "Moulin
Rouge," since Luhrmann first staged the story of the poet Rodolfo's
love for the dying seamstress Mimi at the Australian Opera in 1990,
before he made his mark in film.</TE>
<TE>   Luhrmann sees his remounting of "La Boheme" as a rite of passage
for himself and his wife and Bazmark partner, designer Catherine
Martin. "I always said, after 40 you wouldn't want to be doing 'La
Boheme,' and I'm turning 40 just as we open," says the director,
who's got the art of the schmooze down pat but doesn't flaunt what
reveals itself in conversation to be a keen intelligence. "The red
curtain's coming down on Act 1, and we've already begun on Act 2, but
we have to deal with Act 1 and we're dealing with it through 'La
Boheme.'</TE>
<TE>   "When we did this 13 years ago, we ourselves were kind of kids --
28 and 25," says Luhrmann, his slender build and wired energy barely
contained by the deep chair in which he's seated. "And yes, if the
piece is about saying goodbye to that bohemian, youthful time, then
that's what it's about for us. We were deeply privileged and lucky to
have had so much bohemia, so much youth, for so long. But I'm not
lamenting it. I'm not wishing I was 25 again at all."</TE>
<TE>   Act 1:</TE>
<TE>   A New York rehearsal room,</TE>
<TE>   August</TE>
<TE>   Musetta, the flirty girlfriend of Rodolfo's buddy Marcello, is
about to show up at the Cafe Momus, where the bohemians have
gathered. At this point in the libretto, Luhrmann stops his cast for
a bit of Socratic dialogue. Needling and cajoling the fledgling
vocalists, he tries to get them to grasp this scene as clearly as if
it were a story about meeting their own friends at the local
Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   "What does the crowd say about her, the chorus?" he asks. Various
voices chime in: "Look at her." "What a get-up."</TE>
<TE>   "So she's kind of the Madonna -- the early years -- of the Left
Bank downtown?" he ventures. The singers nod in compliant, if vague,
agreement, not that any of them are old enough to remember the
Parisian Left Bank of the '50s.</TE>
<TE>   He goads soprano Chloe Wright to come up with a pet name for her
character Musetta's wealthy escort, Alcindoro, played by William
Youmans. Shyly she offers, "Sweetie?" The director isn't satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   She tries again: "Bunny-wunny?" Luhrmann ventures further, "And
have they had bunny-wunny time yet, or is that something that's going
to happen?"</TE>
<TE>   Not without effort, Wright and Youmans placate the director's
thirst for detail, if only for the moment. "As long as you have that
clear in your head," Luhrmann says. "You've done a little bit of
nibbling, and that's led to 'bunny-wunny.' But it has to be
absolutely specific in your head."</TE>
<TE>   Luhrmann, who began his career as an actor, believes the key to
his "La Boheme" lies in just such dramatic specificity, and that the
acting has to be Method-real. In fact, rehearsal time is his chief
innovation. Where a typical opera-house "La Boheme" would be
assembled in a month, Luhrmann is spending more than twice that
amount of time, much of it on text work.</TE>
<TE>   "So how is it different than doing something at one of the big
opera houses?" says musical director Constantine Kitsopoulos. "We
have given ourselves the time to do it. It's revolutionary in its
simplicity is what it is."</TE>
<TE>   During the "La Boheme" casting process, which lasted nearly two
years, the production team saw some 3,000 young opera singers,
ultimately choosing an international ensemble, with triple casting in
the leads, Mimi (Lisa Hopkins from the U.S., Wei Huang from China,
Ekaterina Solovyeva from Russia) and Rodolfo (Alfred Boe from the
U.K., Jesus Garcia and David Miller from the U.S.), and double
casting for the secondary couple, Marcello (Eugene Brancoveanu from
Germany and Ben Davis from the U.S.) and Musetta (Jessica Comeau from
Canada and Chloe Wright from the U.K.).</TE>
<TE>   A fresh-faced cast was central to the success of the 1990 Sydney
outing, so they've stuck to that formula here. Revived in 1993 and
filmed for PBS' "Great Performances," that broadcast is what
interested veteran producer Emanuel Azenberg and the team of Jeffrey
Seller and Kevin McCollum, whose first hit was Jonathan Larson's
"Rent," itself an adaptation of "La Boheme."</TE>
<TE>   "Manny and the two boys, their vision was, what if we did 'Rent'
downtown, and we'd bring this really funky 'La Boheme' on Broadway
uptown?" Luhrmann recalls. The producers pursued the project for
years. Finally, when Luhrmann completed "Moulin Rouge," he agreed to
take on the show. In addition to the three and Bazmark Live, other
backers include Bob and Harvey Weinstein and Fox Searchlight
Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the Bazmark duo may not have realized what they were
getting into. "I can't say that a lot of it hasn't been very tough,
but we're sort of coming out the other side," says Martin, widely
known as C.M., a petite blond with an occasionally wicked sense of
humor. While Luhrmann rehearses, his wife is overseeing the final
phases of design and construction of the physical production down at
Bazmark headquarters in SoHo. It's an unimposing second-floor loft
crowded with drafting tables near the front and rows of costume
renderings tacked to the walls.</TE>
<TE>   Winner of Academy Awards for "Moulin Rouge" art direction and
co-costume design (with Angus Strathie), Martin is sitting next to a
large double desk in a sparsely furnished back office. Clocks on the
wall track the time in New York, L.A., London and Sydney, and a map
of Manhattan attests to the fact that the city is still a relatively
new second home for the designer and her husband. "It's been
difficult and fun," she adds. "I suspect though, stupidly, that I
thought it was going to be a lot easier than it's been."</TE>
<TE>   Act 2:</TE>
<TE>   Outside a theater in San Francisco,</TE>
<TE>   September</TE>
<TE>   The impudent clang of a cable car bell rings clarion on a mild
fall afternoon, rising above the urban hubbub, as tourists and
shoppers weave through Union Square. Nearby on Geary Street, the
sidewalk in front of the Curran Theatre is filled with canvas
containers, metal trunks and wooden crates, cryptic labels suggesting
their contents, now safely loaded into the theater. "Fragile Neon."
"Hand Props." "SR Alley Spares."</TE>
<TE>   Passersby note the trunks and crates and pause, attracted perhaps
by the palpable sense of anticipation that radiates from a theater at
such a moment -- when a show moves into the space for the first time.
Their eyes are drawn to glamorous posters advertising "Baz Luhrmann's
production of Puccini's 'La Boheme' " in the two marquees on the
building's exterior, one featuring Boe and Huang and one with Miller
and Solovyeva.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the second day of technical rehearsals is underway.
Orchestra seats that on opening night will be occupied by the
well-connected are now buried under large wooden tech tables, on
which sit computers, keyboards and various other gadgets. Cast and
crew are scattered about the house, while in the balcony more singers
cool their heels alongside children's chorus moms.</TE>
<TE>   For the next two hours, Luhrmann will be onstage with a mic,
calling and recalling cues and running and rerunning transitions, in
an attempt to coordinate the timing of the movement of several set
pieces with the revolving of the Cafe Momus. Eventually, when the
major set pieces are arriving in the right places at the right
moments and nothing is running into anything else, the actors will be
asked to come and take their places in the cafe set. Then the whole
sequence will begin again, still with Luhrmann himself calling the
cues.</TE>
<TE>   In all, nearly 10 days will be spent in technical rehearsals. Some
of that time will be devoted to the microphones and sound equipment
that aren't normally part of opera. "In the Curran Theatre, we have
an acoustic that is actually pretty good, so they're not going to
need to do much," Kitsopoulos says. "But when you get to the Broadway
Theatre, the walls are covered with fabric," which means sound
problems, including a lack of reverberation.</TE>
<TE>   Back in May, the production hired some of the principals to test
the Broadway's acoustics. "David Miller got up and sang and said,
'I'm not getting anything back from the hall,' " Kitsopoulos says.
"On Broadway, the problem is theater availability. Sometimes it's the
luck of the draw. There are some other Broadway theaters I've worked
in where the walls are covered by fabric, and you think, who thought
of that? So it's a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra consists of 24 acoustic instruments and two
keyboards. This is significantly less than would be used in an opera
house -- where 70 or 80 instruments would be the norm, though smaller
companies use fewer -- but not out of line for musical theater.</TE>
<TE>   As is done in opera houses, Luhrmann has opted to stage "La
Boheme" in its original language rather than using an existing
translation or commissioning a new one. "We didn't want to do it and
change it to English," he says, "because there's no way the thing
actually sounds the same."</TE>
<TE>   Act 3:</TE>
<TE>   Inside the San Francisco theater,</TE>
<TE>   October</TE>
<TE>   Luhrmann enters, stage right, with the cuffs of his shirt
dangling, a sartorial gesture that says "artist at work." Speaking to
the preview audience, he issues a caveat about the transition between
Acts 1 and 2. "At some point, it's going to be this incredibly fast,
beautiful change," he says. "But probably not tonight." The house
laughs appreciatively, lapping up his studied nonchalance.</TE>
<TE>   Luhrmann is now in the home stretch of what has turned out to be a
long route back to the stage. "What was shocking to me and to C.M. is
how we were becoming encoded into the very rarefied support systems
that belong to making high-profile movies," he says. "So from Day
One, C.M. and I had to roll our sleeves up and get out of the
trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going up and down in elevators, waiting with kids who are
doing other musicals," he continues. "But I'm suddenly realizing, why
is the elevator going so slowly? And what you realize is that in a
$100-million investment, there's a mechanism that'll go whoosh, and
you go in, whoosh, you go out. So the shock is it's been bloody hard
to just get back to the forced labor that the theater requires."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, the idea of reviving "La Boheme" seemed to make
sense as a first venture in New York theater. Luhrmann's next film
project is the Dino De Laurentiis historical epic about Alexander the
Great for 20th Century Fox and Universal. " 'Boheme' was a perfect
medium to kind of learn the ropes of Broadway," Martin says. "We'd
done it before, so it'd be easier." The choice certainly wasn't a
matter of youthful folly. Yet it has become a moment of transition
and reflection for Luhrmann and Martin, a looking glass in which to
view their own past. Whether it also proves pragmatic remains to be
seen.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably might be looking in six months' time, going, 'That
was a silly idea,' " Luhrmann says. "Fair enough. However, anything
we make, we make because we want to make it, because it relates
specifically to my life. We don't do things because we need to get a
few extra bucks off 'La Boheme.' We're doing it because it's our life
choice."</TE>

<LD>Glass: "Itaipu," Salonen: "Two Songs to Poems of Ann Jaderlund," Los
Angeles Master Chorale, Grant Gershon, conductor ***, RCM</LD>
<LD>   Contemporary choral music needs love -- an end to which this
recording contributes amply. Grant Gershon leads his formidable group
in two vital, recent entries in the field, each of which addresses a
post-serial musical landscape in distinct ways.</LD>
<LD>   Philip Glass' 1989 work paying tribute to the epic hydroelectric
dam bordering Brazil and Paraguay relies on his coolly heroic if
overly familiar harmonic language, spiked by mercurial dissonances in
the instrumental periphery. Esa-Pekka Salonen's evocative "Two Songs
to Poems of Ann Jaderlund," written during his sabbatical from the
Los Angeles Philharmonic in 2000 and premiered by the L.A. Master
Chorale last March, manages a balance of forces both ethereal and
impelling. Gershon and the ensemble effectively bring life to the
swirling sensuality of the Swedish poet's "Deep in the room" and
"Kiss my mouth."</LD>
<TE>   This is work ideally suited to the essential, mysterious realm of
choral music.</TE>
<TE>   -- Josef Woodard</TE>
<TE>   Placido Domingo broadly defines the word 'sacred'</TE>
<TE>   "Sacred Songs" Placido Domingo, Placido Domingo, tenor; Sissel,
vocalist; Paolo Rustichelli, piano, guitar and synthesizers; Luisa
Domingo, harp; Orchestra Sinfonica e Coro di Milano Giuseppe Verdi,
Marcello Viotti, conductor, **, Deutsche Grammophon</TE>
<TE>   If you think "Climb Ev'ry Mountain" is a sacred song, you may
accept all the contents of this album of miscellany enthusiastically.
Otherwise, call it Kyrie Lite. Granted, the veteran tenor's singing
is handsome and mellifluous, the pops accompaniments -- virtually
everything here is arranged or overarranged for maximum accessibility
-- pleasant. There are even three "Ave Marias," including a nice one
by P.D. Jr. Mostly, however, with legit but secular items such as
Bach's "Bist du bei mir" and Wagner's "Der Engel," this is just
another hodgepodge.</TE>
<TE>   --Daniel Cariaga</TE>
<TE>   Still-relevant Reichians</TE>
<TE>   Steve Reich: "Tehillim" and "Desert Music", Alarm Will Sound;
Ossia; Alan Pierson, conductor, ***, Cantaloupe</TE>
<TE>   These potent 1980s-vintage works, fine examples of Steve Reich's
imaginative text-setting skills, originally came out in the age of
the LP. Heard back to back on one disc, in fresh and energetic new
performances by two East Coast new music groups, they present
complementary but also distinct angles on the composer's aesthetic.
It sounds as current and relevant as ever.</TE>
<TE>   Reich blended otherworldly voices, percussion and instrumental
forces in creating the unique canvas for "Tehillim," based on Psalms.
William Carlos Williams' beguiling poem "Desert Music" gets its
musical due in Reich's rhythmically nuanced setting, written in 1984
and revised in this leaner, meaner chamber version in 2001. At once
propulsive and vaporous, the work defies any simple Minimalist
categorization. On this recording, the final movement of "Desert
Music" leaves you a bit breathless, with its rattling culmination of
energies that have been slowly and craftily marshaled throughout, and
then its sighing, enigmatic denouement.</TE>

<TE>   Choral works past and present</TE>
<TE>   "In Excelsis" Choir of New College, Oxford; Edward Higginbottom,
conductor, *** 1/2, Erato</TE>
<TE>   This disc juxtaposes glorious 16th century English choral
polyphonic works with equally worthy contemporary church pieces, as
well as less deeply affecting secular choruses. No one has to make a
case for Thomas Tallis or the first John Taverner (1490-1545), but
some of their contemporaries deserve to be better known. Nicholas
Ludford (1490-1557), for instance, wrote a sumptuous "Ave cujus
conceptio."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the contemporaries dazzle. The John Taverner born in 1944
penned an ecstatic "Hymn to the Mother of God," as well as two
powerful settings of poems by William Blake ("The Lamb" and "The
Tyger"). Giles Swayne wrote a rhythm-popping Magnificat (1982) that
takes flight from African responsive chant. The men and boys Choir of
New College, Oxford, sing lovingly under the direction of Edward
Higginbottom.</TE>

<TE>   Rip-roaring Tchaikovsky</TE>
<TE>   Tchaikovsky: "Souvenir de Florence," Dvorak: Sextet in A, Sarah
Chang, Bernhard Hartog, violins; Wolfram Christ, Tanja Christ,
violas; Georg Faust, Olaf Maninger, cellos, ***, EMI Classics</TE>
<TE>   The classical shelves are almost evenly split between versions of
"Souvenir de Florence" for string orchestra and the original grouping
for sextet as heard here. Either way, it's a winningly exuberant
piece that for all of its swinging, surging, memorable tunes has
received strangely lukewarm press over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Chang's chamber-mates are all current or former members of the
Berlin Philharmonic -- and they let go of their luxurious collective
tone just enough to let it rip at the right moments (though the
Borodin Quartet's furious BMG/Melodiya recording, with Mstislav
Rostropovich as guest cellist, beats them in sheer visceral impact).
They apply more warmth and rubato to the seldom-recorded Dvorak
Sextet, an agreeable work that, true to form, follows most of the
traditional Central European chamber music formulas while casting

<TE>   What do these three sonatas have in common? What makes them
Gallic? Lightness, joy and optimism -- with a subtext of melancholy.
Midori and her longtime pianist, McDonald, bring out all the nuances
of style, of pleasure, of gentle hedonism in all three sonatas,
bringing to bear particularly in Poulenc's single work in the form, a
haunting piece dedicated to the memory of Federico Garcia Lorca, and
rewritten after the death of violinist Ginette Neveu, who played it
often with the composer. And both Midori and McDonald sail handsomely
through Saint-Saens' First Sonata with the right combination of
breeziness and sentiment. They do the same for Debussy's cogent,
stoic, final work. The playing is splendid; moreover, it
communicates.</TE>

<TE>   Shostakovich won the Lenin Prize in 1958 for this symphony, whose
subtitle, "The Year 1905," commemorates the first Russian Revolution.
Dissidents denounced the composer for selling out. Western critics
regarded the work as glorified film music. Turns out just about
everyone was wrong. There is little uplift in the long adagios (first
and third movements) that establish a sense of tension and
desolation. The depiction of the czar's troops firing into the crowd
(second movement) does plunge us into the center of a horrifying
event, but the march final movement turns out to be fueled with
bitterness, anger, even a wild hysteria. The ending sounds more
apocalyptic than it does affirmative. Rostropovich sustains the
tension and the composer's dry realism to create an epic canvas.</TE>

<HD>Relationships that seem so long ago</HD>
<DH>Director Peter Mattei figured a film about connecting amid
the dot-com boom would be topical. Then came 9/11. Now he sees his
work as nostalgic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andre Chautard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Almost any first-time director would envy the cast Peter Mattei was
able to assemble for his bittersweet debut feature, "Love in the Time
of Money," which follows a roundelay of sexual encounters between
unhappy Manhattanites looking for fulfillment during the dot-com
fever of the 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   The ensemble includes veteran character actors Steve Buscemi and
Carol Kane; familiar television faces Jill Hennessy ("Crossing
Jordan") and Michael Imperioli ("The Sopranos"); and a host of
up-and-comers including Rosario Dawson ("Men in Black II"), Adrian
Grenier ("Harvard Man") and Domenick Lombardozzi (HBO's "The Wire").</LD>
<LD>   But these actors are so in demand that not even a few are
available on the same date to schedule a premiere in New York. "I was
bummed out," Mattei says, "but I'm actually really happy that every
single actor is working."</LD>
<TE>   With several current screenwriting gigs, Mattei, 45, is keeping
busy himself. After working over the years as a playwright, stage
director, video game designer and Yale film studies instructor,
Mattei, a longtime Brooklyn resident, finally resolved a few years
ago to focus on his true desire. "I just decided, I really would
rather just make a film, even if it's for 50 cents," he says over
breakfast at a cafe on La Brea Avenue. The film opened on Friday in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   After three years of designing content for Internet companies,
Mattei wanted to portray how during an economic boom he saw New
Yorkers around him frustrated in their relationships. Many of the
film's characters are based on people he knew, like an angry, ex-cop
landlord or jaded art-world friends. Mattei lifted the structure for
his script from the 1896 Arthur Schnitzler play "Reigen," which has
been adapted frequently in works such as Max Ophuls' 1950 film "La
Ronde" and David Hare's recent play "The Blue Room."</TE>
<TE>   "Love in the Time of Money" opens with a scene between a
prostitute and her john (as "Reigen" does), then follows the john as
he works as a contractor for an undersexed, wealthy housewife -- and
then follows the housewife with her aloof husband and so on, up and
down through social classes until arriving, full circle, with the
prostitute from the first scene.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't interested in it just being about sex," Mattei says. "I
was more interested in it being about desire and loneliness and how
we affect each other in really subtle ways."</TE>
<TE>   The film itself was affected by an event that was anything but
subtle: the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. "When we did the rough
assembly, at the end it just had a sadder feeling than we anticipated
that it would, and we spent a lot of time fighting that with pop
songs and faster cuts," Mattei says. "It just really wasn't working
and I thought, 'Let's just let the film be what it wants to be.' "</TE>
<TE>   When Mattei wrote the script, he intended it to be set in the
present. "At the time, we really felt like these times were going to
go on forever," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But the attacks coupled with the fall of the stock market placed
the finished film firmly in the past. "I look at [the film] sometimes
and I think that these people are ghosts, that maybe they all died."</TE>
<TE>   Even the ironic title, a play on the title of the Gabriel Garcia
Marquez novel "Love in the Time of Cholera," seemed to reflect a
change. The film had the working titles "Nine Scenes About Love" and
"The End of Love." Mattei remembers that he came up with "Love in the
Time of Money" on Sept. 10, 2001. Now, he reflects, "it has a sense
of nostalgia in it, like it's a different time."</TE>
<TE>   Mattei's script had been accepted in 1998 by the Sundance
Filmmakers Lab, where it was optioned by Robert Redford through his
production company, which helped secure a $650,000 budget. Mattei
says Redford gave him advice on the set and in the editing room, and
the film screened in the dramatic competition in a special
noncompeting slot (because of the ties to Redford) at the Sundance
Film Festival this year. The film received mixed to negative reviews
but was acquired for distribution during the festival by ThinkFilm.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to shoot on digital video was budgetary, Mattei says,
and he and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski ("You Can Count on Me")
wanted to avoid the gritty, hand-held look of the Dogma films they
were seeing. The two took care in lighting the film, which was shot
in 23 days at the end of 2000, mostly in Brooklyn, giving it a
distinctive sleek and glossy look.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in editing, Mattei tried to cut between the different
story strands -- in the manner of independent films such as "Your
Friends &amp; Neighbors" and this year's fellow Sundance entry "13
Conversations About One Thing" -- but he ultimately stuck with the
"Reigen" template, adding an abstract, ruminative ending.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt like it's much riskier to do it this way," Mattei
says. "It's much harder on the audience because you have to sit in a
room with two people for a long period of time and people just aren't
used to that in American films."</TE>

<HD>Letting loose the laughter</HD>
<DH>After such intense films as 'Hannibal' and 'Gladiator,'
Ridley Scott relaxes with the con caper 'Matchstick Men.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Desowitz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking for a departure from the fast-paced action of historical
epics and desert gun battles, not to mention the grisly appetites of
a certain psychotic psychiatrist, director Ridley Scott says
"Matchstick Men," a contemporary, seriocomic caper movie set in the
San Fernando Valley, offered just what he was looking for.</LD>
<LD>   An encounter during filming recently at Culver Studios found Scott
joking with Nicolas Cage, Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohman during a
break in what is arguably the film's most intense scene, in which
their big con unexpectedly unravels.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the tension required for this particular scene, the
veteran director and Cage say they are in a mellower mood on this
movie, which concerns a con man mired in a rut of going from one
small-time scam to the next.</LD>
<TE>   For Scott, who took a breather from prepping "Tripoli," his next
historical epic with Russell Crowe that's about Barbary Coast
pirates, it was an opportunity to make something lighter. "I cranked
up the volume for the last five years" -- with "Gladiator,"
"Hannibal," "Black Hawk Down" -- "and now this," Scott says. "It's
all about looking ahead. My lady friend and producing partner
Giannina Facio found it for me.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw it as a comedy. I don't mean fall-about-laughing comedy,
but a lot of witty humor. But then I thought 'Thelma &amp; Louise' was a
comedy, too.</TE>
<TE>   "The central character is interesting. He's talented at being a
con man but is very safe and never crosses the line into deep water.
But I loved the wrinkle in the character, who also has a psychosis,
which is all about guilt for taking money from unsuspecting people
who are greedy."</TE>
<TE>   For Cage, who recently married Priscilla Presley and continually
reinvents himself after his Oscar-winning portrayal of an alcoholic
Hollywood insider in "Leaving Las Vegas," the movie offered the
chance to discard at least some of the screen angst he's carried over
the years.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Cage has lost his idiosyncratic edge. His character, Roy,
is full of fears, phobias and insecurities, as he grifts his way from
one cheap con after another. But he lacks the insecurity of, say,
screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, whom he plays in the upcoming Spike
Jonze film "Adaptation."</TE>
<TE>   As Cage says, "Roy feels pretty good about himself despite his
behavioral problems. For me, it's a sign of maturity that I don't
worry anymore about what people think of my work. I just go for it
and see where it lands."</TE>
<TE>   You could say the same about Scott. Having guided Crowe through an
Oscar-winning performance in "Gladiator," Scott likes working with
actors. He enjoys collaborating with them.</TE>
<TE>   Scott gave the cast of "Matchstick Men" the freedom to physically
express their behavioral problems. Cage has his usual assortment of
nervous tics and gestures -- a guilt-ridden man who feels safer in
his home than on the street; Rockwell, who plays Cage's partner and
protege in crime, came up with a twitching routine; and Lohman, who
plays Cage's teenage daughter, tapped into a klutzy side after
stumbling on the set.</TE>
<TE>   Offering a distinctive perspective of Scott's work on this film,
Rockwell says, "It's kind of like a samurai warrior asked to open up
a loaf of French bread with his sword.</TE>
<TE>   "He can take a small movie like this with a linear story line and
give it a special spice," continues Rockwell, last seen in "Welcome
to Collinwood" and whose "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" opens in
December. "He changes angle every scene. He gives it an artsy edge.
But he only does two or three takes because he knows what he wants."</TE>
<TE>   Rockwell is Oscar to Cage's Felix in this "Odd Couple"
partnership. "I'm the comic relief," Rockwell adds, looking beat up
after a fight scene and wearing a Hawaiian shirt, blue jeans and
cowboy boots. "I'm the guy you don't want to lose in a horror film
when things go bad." Rockwell also portrays the character who propels
the plot, finally persuading Cage, who has enjoyed comfortable
small-time success, to take a chance at a big $80,000 con.</TE>
<TE>   The protagonist's life really gets complicated when Lohman arrives
out of nowhere. Unlike her stoic performance in "White Oleander,"
Lohman gets to cut loose as a wisecracking 15-year-old in "Matchstick
Men."</TE>
<TE>   "In real life I like to observe and process things more slowly;
here I get to act on impulse right away," Lohman says on her 23rd
birthday, bringing to mind Little Red Riding Hood with her red
sweatshirt and pink dress. On the set, she's like a sponge, absorbing
everything from the more experienced, patient Cage.</TE>
<TE>   A father-daughter tale at heart</TE>
<TE>   "It's 'Paper Moon' in color," suggests Ted Griffin, who adapted
"Matchstick Men" with his older brother Nick from an unpublished
novella by Eric Garcia. The two had never officially collaborated,
although Nick helped Ted smooth over some of the rough spots in
"Ocean's Eleven." You can tell the Griffin brothers are siblings by
their Hollywood banter and the way they complete each other's
thoughts. "We never knew we were brothers until we met in school,"
Ted jokes. "We had no idea we shared the same parents and lived under
the same roof."</TE>
<TE>   Nick says they took the script to Robert Zemeckis and his
producing partners Jack Rapke and Steve Starkey. "Zemeckis thought
about directing for a minute but decided to executive-produce," Nick
says. "Bob had us refocus on the con and big twist. Our intention was
to do a drama about con men as opposed to a con movie. It's becoming
less of a con movie and more of a father-daughter story. What Ridley
has brought to the table is the comedic strain, which is unusual for
him and was surprising to us. It was there in a dry sort of way."</TE>
<TE>   Also apparent in a much more flamboyant way is the film's retro
visual style, a world apart from the futuristic Los Angeles of "Blade
Runner," yet very much in keeping with Scott and Cage's conception of
Roy as a kindred spirit to Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin. Roy's house
-- his haven from the outside world -- is filled with all sorts of
pop culture artifacts, including a plastic replica of the RCA dog on
the kitchen table.</TE>
<TE>   It's like stepping back in time, which is precisely the director's
intent. The interior set is styled after a '50s Canoga Park home,
while the exterior is inspired by one of Gregory Ain's Mar Vista
modernist designs of the late '40s.</TE>
<TE>   "The Valley is very visual, very beautiful, contemporary but quite
still," Scott says. "It's tricky because the Valley is visually
arresting 'cause you've got the sunshine. Heat gives it a peculiar
suburban beauty even though parts of the Valley are depressing.
Similar to the way Edward Hopper uses beauty to underscore a darker
subject matter. The camera never moves sometimes in this film, and
the actors carry the moment."</TE>

<HD>Yes, lamb was the entree</HD>
<DH>Embryologist Bill Ritchie, who helped devise Dolly the
sheep, addresses a Westside gathering on cloning's human
applications.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Ehrman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If quality of life for an aging population can be improved through
genetic manipulation, then the man of the hour is embryologist Bill
Ritchie. The featured speaker at a recent soiree, Ritchie was a
clutch member of Dr. Ian Wilmut's Roslin Institute in Edinburgh,
Scotland, which spliced together the chromosomes that, in 1997,
resulted in Dolly, the first cloned sheep.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to do something to extend those active vital years,"
insisted Kay Kimberly Siegel, hostess, socialite and founder of the
Siegel Life Project at the UCLA Center on Aging, which she funds to
direct research into areas where governments and corporations won't.
During the hoopla that followed Dolly's creation, Siegel and her
husband, Joseph, visited the Roslin Institute and befriended Ritchie
and Wilmot. Siegel now proudly brandishes a photo of herself being
kissed by the world's most famous sheep.</LD>
<LD>   When Ritchie finally accepted the couple's open invitation to come
visit, the Siegels immediately organized an impromptu dinner party at
their Mediterranean-style villa in a development adjacent to Century
City. "The guests here are interested in both anti-aging and
cloning," Siegel said.</LD>
<TE>   The party invites said Roslin is looking into cloning human
embryos, not to make babies, but to harvest stem cells for possible
cures of diseases that afflict the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   "This may cure Parkinson's," said Kerry Martin, who recently wrote
"How Do You Stay So Young?," a distillation of her experience with
the likes of Mary Pickford, John Wayne, Tyrone Power, Heather
Locklear and "what I learned from each of them about staying young."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm interested in stem cell research and its connection to heart
disease and Alzheimer's," said Richard Anderson, who played Lee
Majors' boss on "The Six Million Dollar Man."</TE>
<TE>   Also among the 30 or so guests were a contingent of researchers
from UCLA and 72-year-old Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin, an embodiment of
anti-aging himself, who demonstrated remarkable spryness back in
September by clocking a Bible-brandishing skeptic who demanded that
the former NASA astronaut publicly swear he walked on the moon. In a
room of black tie and pink chiffon, Aldrin, who attended with wife
Lois, wore a moon-and-star-pattern tie, his way of "showing the
colors."</TE>
<TE>   The guest of honor showed colors of his own. While clothed in
conventionally formal uppers, below the midsection, the bearded
Edinburgh resident sported a hunting Stewart tartan, woolen knee
socks and a pair of ventilated black ghillies brogues. He entertained
the gathering with an easy-to-follow slide show presentation,
depicting the tools and methods of gene splicing.</TE>
<TE>   The photos of Dolly elicited a collective swoon even though
everyone's belly was still full of the lamb dinner. ("I just told the
caterer to bring what he brought to our last party," Siegel
explained. "I didn't think about the lamb.")</TE>
<TE>   During Q&amp;A, Red Buttons asked, "Should I clone my William Morris
agent so there'll be someone else to answer my phone calls?" Everyone
laughed. The embryologist took the clone-clowning in stride but drew
the line at his country's other renowned creature. "I won't talk
about the Loch Ness monster," he said.</TE>
<TE>   More serious questions followed about re-engineering endangered
species, the difficulties in transplanting old cells and the current
applications for human diseases. Ritchie described how sheep are
cloned to produce milk with a clotting protein for human hemophiliacs
and discussed how transgenic animals are used to harvest human organs
-- the rest of the human applications are years if not decades away.
"At the moment," Ritchie said (which, with his thick accent, sounds
to an American ear like "at the moo-ment"), "we stop at cloning human
beings. It's far too dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone caught the message. "It really is the fountain of
youth," someone gushed.</TE>
<TE>   For Marilyn and Harry Lewis, owners of the restaurants Kate
Mantilini and the Gardens of Glendon, the information presented was
stimulating but hardly the answer to any prayers. "I'm sort of glad
I'll be checking out soon," Marilyn Lewis said. "I don't want to be
here when people are 200 years old with borrowed body parts, thank
you very much. I've had very good life."</TE>

<HD>Lou Adler, in the foreground</HD>
<DH>The onetime pop music trend-setter has long shunned the
spotlight. Now he's parted the curtains on his past -- but only for a
cause.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick Goldstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's somehow fitting that if you stand on a bluff above Lou Adler's
Malibu home office, you can look up and down the misty coastline and
almost see forever. If there was one person who helped popularize
what's known as Southern California cool, it's Adler, a 66-year-old
music producer and record company entrepreneur who was involved --
Zelig-like -- with virtually every big youth culture explosion in the
formative years of modern Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Adler restlessly devoured every new pop trend: early '60s surf and
car culture (he produced many of Jan &amp; Dean's hits), L.A. folkie
romanticism (he produced and put out the Mamas &amp; the Papas' hits),
the Sunset Strip club scene (his discovery, Johnny Rivers, put the
Whisky a Go-Go on the map), protest rock (he produced Barry McGuire's
"Eve of Destruction"), rock festivals (Adler co-produced the Monterey
Pop Festival) and '70s stoner culture (Adler launched Cheech &amp; Chong
and directed their first movie, "Up in Smoke").</LD>
<LD>   That still leaves out plenty of other career highlights, like
writing Sam Cooke's "(What a) Wonderful World" and producing Carole
King's mellow-music classic "Tapestry" and bringing "The Rocky Horror
Show" to America, but you get the idea. Pop historians still haven't
made up their mind if Adler was a wily opportunist or a sage hipster
with an uncanny nose for talent.</LD>
<TE>   But from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s, wherever the zeitgeist
was, Adler wasn't far away, always part of the scene but safely
behind the scenes. As the Mamas &amp; the Papas singer Michelle Phillips
once put it: "Lou was rich, wore interesting hats and didn't give a
lot of clues to his innermost being."</TE>
<TE>   To this day, Adler has remained offstage in the shadows. And
that's the irony. Adler has been so media-shy that when he was on the
dais at a music business dinner a few years ago, industry toastmaster
Joe Smith introduced Adler by saying, "After all the gold records and
the smash hits ... Lou is known as the guy with the hat and the beard
who sits next to Jack Nicholson at the Lakers' games."</TE>
<TE>   Adler sat down for a rare interview the other day at his Malibu
office, which has a half-court basketball court in the driveway, a
drum kit and amps in the living room (his son Cisco's band uses the
office as a rehearsal studio) and a host of vintage photos, including
one of Adler and John Phillips on the cover of an early issue of
Rolling Stone. But Adler only parted the curtain to promote a cause,
not himself. He and his wife, Page Adler, have helped organize a
one-night celebrity benefit for the Painted Turtle Camp, a new
spinoff of Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang camps for children
with life-threatening illnesses. The new camp, on 173 acres near Lake
Hughes, is expected to open in late 2003. The benefit, a theater
reading based on Ernest Hemingway's Nick Adams short stories, will be
held Nov. 4 at the Kodak Theatre. The A-list talent includes
Nicholson, Newman, Julia Roberts, Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Warren
Beatty, Bruce Willis, Danny Glover, Danny DeVito, Goldie Hawn and
Edward James Olmos.</TE>
<TE>   Days of serendipity</TE>
<TE>   Adler has always been surrounded by talent. He grew up in Boyle
Heights, then L.A.'s great melting-pot neighborhood. His Roosevelt
High basketball team, he recalls, "had a Japanese kid, a Russian kid,
a black kid and a Jew -- me." Adler went to Los Angeles City College
in the '50s, where he befriended a trumpet player who had a trio that
played weddings and bar mitzvahs.</TE>
<TE>   The trumpet player was Herb Alpert, who started writing songs with
Adler.</TE>
<TE>   They shopped their material to Bumps Blackwell, a legendary R&amp;B
talent scout, who hired them as apprentice artists-and-repertoire
men. When Blackwell needed a song for a Cooke session, Adler and
Alpert wrote "Wonderful World" with Cooke, using the pseudonym of
Barbara Campbell, Cooke's wife. "We cut it in an unfinished recording
studio on 3rd Street," Adler recalls. "The walls still had fiberglass
pack in them. We had a 16-year-old kid play the drums because the
regular drummer wasn't there."</TE>
<TE>   Adler's first discovery was a pair of volleyball players named Jan
Berry and Dean Torrance. As Jan &amp; Dean, they helped popularize
California as an eternal playground, with hits like "Ride the Wild
Surf," "Dead Man's Curve" and "The Little Old Lady From Pasadena."
Adler recorded their early songs on a one-track mono machine with the
duo singing at a piano in Berry's garage. "We often had to do 30 or
40 splices to get the vocals right," Adler says. "Then we'd go into
the studio and have the musicians match the rhythm of the vocal
track."</TE>
<TE>   Everything was done on the fly. Adler remembers cutting a record
one night, taking it to a pressing plant on Wilcox Avenue and getting
it on Top 40 giant KFWB four days later. One night Adler wandered
into a club on La Cienega and saw Johnny Rivers, a young white
guitarist who did slick covers of black R&amp;B hits. Rivers was so
exciting in a club setting that Adler decided on a novel strategy for
launching a rock act -- he had Rivers cut a live album at the Whisky
a Go-Go, a new club run by pal Elmer Valentine. The "live" billing
was something of a stretch -- much of the record was sweetened in the
studio with studio musicians and a trio of backup singers called the
Blossoms. "If anyone is carrying a tune on the record," Adler jokes,
"it's the Blossoms." Still, the album was a huge hit and established
the Whisky as the hip nightspot in town.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '60s, New York was still the center of the
pop-culture universe, home to the media taste makers and most of the
established record companies. All Los Angeles had was its decaying
movie studios, run by aging moguls whose idea of cool was making
movies with Ricky Nelson. "The surf records really put L.A. on the
map," Adler says. "The music drew the attention of the record
companies and then the media and the ad agencies, who started using
'a Go-Go' in their ads and putting California girls like Peggy Lipton
and Michelle Phillips in their commercials, and soon there was a
whole scene here."</TE>
<TE>   Almost overnight, the Sunset Strip blossomed with clubs showcasing
a new generation of L.A. rock bands like the Doors, the Byrds and the
Buffalo Springfield. "Kids would drive by, hanging out the car
windows, playing tambourines," Adler says. "You couldn't walk on
Sunset because it was so crowded." By then Adler had his own label,
Dunhill Records. He tried to sign the Buffalo Springfield, but lost
them when he refused to give their road manager a payoff. When a
ragged quartet of hippie singers called the Mamas &amp; the Papas showed
up to audition one day, he didn't make the same mistake. Adler told
them: "I'll give you whatever you want, just don't go see anybody
else." The band's leader, John Phillips, replied, "What we want is a
steady stream of money from your office to our house."</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco bands preached peace and love. The L.A. scene
thrived on hustle. Adler makes no claim of sainthood. "We were street
guys going up against a lot of big companies, so we did what we had
to do," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "There weren't a lot of attorneys in the business then, so if we
were taken sometimes, we did some taking too."</TE>
<TE>   When the antiwar movement began in the mid-1960s, Adler gave a
copy of Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone" to his in-house
songwriters, P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri, who until then had been
performing as the Fantastic Baggies and writing songs like "Tell 'Em
I'm Surfin'." Soon they were writing protest anthems for Adler like
McGuire's "Eve of Destruction." When Adler and John Phillips put on
the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967, Phillips penned his own
festival commercial, Scott McKenzie's "San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear
Flowers in Your Hair)," which Adler released on his new label, Ode
Records.</TE>
<TE>   Immortalized in D.A. Pennebaker's documentary "Monterey Pop," the
festival launched the careers of innumerable rock and pop icons,
including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Steve Miller, Laura Nyro and
the Quicksilver Messenger Service. By the late '60s, Adler and his
pop star pals were mixing it up with the young royalty from the movie
business. When the Mamas &amp; the Papas played the Hollywood Bowl,
everyone from Keith Richards to Steve McQueen was in the audience.
Peter Fonda was hanging out with David Crosby, Mia Farrow was buying
Mama Cass silk robes at her favorite shop in Beverly Hills, and Jack
Nicholson was dating Michelle Phillips, who introduced Adler to his
basketball buddy.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if he crossed over between music and movies, Adler
laughs and says, "Well, I dated a lot of actresses." "Ride the Wild
Surf" starlet Shelley Fabares, his first wife, did the liner notes
for Jan &amp; Dean albums. Adler cut an album with Peggy Lipton, an old
girlfriend. Ann-Margret, another girlfriend, nicknamed Adler
"Spunky," which he used as his writing credit on Jan &amp; Dean's
"Honolulu Lulu." Britt Ekland, mother of Adler's oldest son, turned
him on to "The Rocky Horror Show," which Adler put on at the Roxy, a
club he launched in the early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping his hand in</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Nicholson, who has shared Laker seats with Adler for 30
years, the producer has given up dating for domesticity. Adler has
been married to Page, Daryl Hannah's sister, for 11 years. Adler now
has seven sons (the youngest four with Page), who range in age from 1
to 30. As he drolly puts it: "Toys in my shower for 30 years." Adler
still keeps his hand in, organizing the Painted Turtle Camp benefit
and producing a new TV version of "The Rocky Horror Show." But his
days as an industry player are over -- he's content to let the next
generation have the stage. His oldest son, Nic, runs the Roxy and
manages Whitestarr, a band whose singer is Adler's 24-year-old son,
Cisco. His 18-year-old son, Sonny, is in film school in Denmark.</TE>
<TE>   Adler keeps up with current music -- his favorite artists include
Ryan Adams, Norah Jones, John Mayer, No Doubt, the Red Hot Chili
Peppers and the Dixie Chicks. But he's dismayed by the overwhelming
corporatization of the music business.</TE>
<TE>   "The creative process always suffers when the corporate side of
the business has more control," he says. "It's amazing how much power
the record companies have today -- they have a right to stop artists
after they've recorded their rough mixes and make them cut something
they think can get played on the radio. When I did 'Tapestry' with
Carole King, the record was spare and simple, like a demo. If someone
had told me to go back and put horns on it, it would've been all
wrong. If you're enthusiastic enough to sign an artist, let them do
what got you enthusiastic."</TE>
<TE>   Of his role in helping shape so much of L.A.'s pop iconography,
Adler simply says, "I was always curious. I just got a thrill out of
discovering new things." He has no regrets about keeping such a low
profile.</TE>
<TE>   "I always respected what the artists did. They're the stars.
Whatever I did, I felt more comfortable in the background. I was just
happy to be along for the ride."</TE>

<HD>A short time ago, in a galaxy ...</HD>
<DH>Three 'Star Wars' films reenacted in just 30 minutes?
That's the offbeat accomplishment of a writer and his pals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugh Hart</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly every summer since 1996, one of the Edinburgh Festival
Fringe's hottest shows has been performed by a group of California
college students who run, leap, slide and make bang-bang sounds as
they race around the stage acting like 7-year-olds playing dress-up.</LD>
<LD>   One distinction: 7-year-olds probably have better props.</LD>
<LD>   But the USC-based troupe gets to spit out world-famous dialogue,
since all of the lines for its whiz-bang romp, "Star Wars Trilogy in
30 Minutes," have been lifted verbatim from three of the most popular
films on the planet: "Star Wars," "The Empire Strikes Back" and
"Return of the Jedi."</LD>
<TE>   "Star Wars Trilogy in 30 Minutes," which had its first public
stateside performance Friday at the Coronet Theatre Upstairs, is a
kick to perform, with or without packed houses, says creator-director
Patrick T. Gorman.</TE>
<TE>   "The audience is a blessing," he says. "But we have so much fun
pretending that we're kids again, shooting at each other and playing
good guys and bad guys, that the reception we get is almost
secondary."</TE>
<TE>   During a recent run-through, the actors indeed seem eager to
transform themselves into the space saga's fantastical characters.
Rummaging through a cardboard box full of bric-a-brac, Michael
Cornacchia, who plays Jabba the Hutt, picks out a stuffed animal.
When he wags the toy threateningly during a tense scene, this worn
plush elephant comes to life as Jabba's fearsome henchman. A couple
of Wiffle bats suffice as laser swords. And a folding chair near the
stage isn't just for sitting. By placing it over his head, James
Snyder, as Luke Skywalker, turns the chair into the cockpit of his
trusty X-Wing Fighter.</TE>
<TE>   Gorman, 30, got the idea for his dime-store "Star Wars" from Tom
Stoppard, of all people. The formidably highbrow English playwright
had authored "The 15 Minute Hamlet," and Gorman was taken with the
concept. "I was a big fan of Stoppard's and mounted a production of
'The 15 Minute Hamlet' back in Nebraska," Gorman says. In 1995, while
working on his master's of fine arts in writing at USC, he says, "I
took a class where you could mount your own show. I wanted to do
something visually based that was also connected to something very
dear to me as a child, so I thought it would be fun to do all three
'Star Wars' films -- there were only three at the time -- in 30
minutes, just as Stoppard did with 'Hamlet.' "</TE>
<TE>   To squeeze the movies' cumulative seven-hour running time down to
half an hour, Gorman condensed action sequences and sped up the
crazed relationship arc transpiring among Luke Skywalker, Princess
Leia and Darth Vader.</TE>
<TE>   "Outside the whole mythic structure, what you have in 'Star Wars'
is just about the most dysfunctional outer-space family ever," he
says. "In the first episode, the brother actually wants his own
sister [romantically], plus the person trying to kill them both is
their father, who tortures the daughter, blows up her planet and
later chops his son's hand off. For people who are not as deeply
entrenched in the films, the play has a soap opera-like feel to it."</TE>
<TE>   When it came time to cast the first "30 Minutes" production,
Gorman gave himself the role of a lifetime. He would finally get to
portray his childhood hero, Han Solo, in front of paying customers.
Then Gorman's professional judgment kicked in. "I was a little too
chunky, and a little too balding and very uncool, and that wouldn't
have worked for the character," Gorman says. Instead, Gorman played
Yoda -- in kneepads. "30 Minutes" producer Steve Josephson, who has
since inherited the role, kneels when he plays the height-challenged
sage. He also plays R2D2. As the robot, Josephson walks stiffly and
carries a trash basket crowned by an inverted stainless-steel salad
bowl.</TE>
<TE>   What does George Lucas think about all this? And why would the
fiercely protective auteur authorize a campy Cliffs Notes version of
his intellectual property? As luck would have it, Gorman's professor
John Blankenchip taught a directing class that Lucas took in the late
'60s. Blankenchip and his colleague Ken Miura, another of Lucas' USC
mentors, approached their former student, explaining that the piece
would serve as a fundraiser for Festival Theatre USC-USA, a program
that gives students here a chance to take part in the Edinburgh
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas gave the green light. But it wasn't until last August that
Lucas actually saw "30 Minutes" for himself. A nervous Gorman and his
colleagues drove north to Skywalker Ranch in Northern California for
a command performance in front of the entire LucasFilm staff.</TE>
<TE>   They were a hit, Wiffle bats and all.</TE>
<TE>   "I was quite impressed that they were able to find a way to make
'Star Wars' faster and more intense," says Lucas, speaking from his
Marin County headquarters. "I'm always happy that 'Star Wars'
continues to be a source of creative inspiration, and I hope to see
them perform again after Episode 3 comes out, when they can do all
six 'Star Wars' in 60 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Gorman is game. "Our producer's daughter is a dead ringer for
Natalie Portman, so we're already set for that role. As long as Lucas
keeps making the films, we'll keep trying to make them shorter."</TE>

<DH>'The Syringa Tree,' Pamela Gien's traveling one-woman play,
draws on the joy and the sorrow of her years in South Africa.</DH>

<LD>Actress Pamela Gien did not want to remember the sad times of her
childhood in South Africa. She did not want to remember the
injustices she saw or the tragedy that struck her family there.</LD>
<LD>   But after being ignored for three decades, those memories rose
sharply to the surface in a Los Angeles acting class exercise.
Vibrant and malleable, they took shape first as improv, then as a
written performance and finally as a play that has now traveled to
New York and London and home again.</LD>
<LD>   Gien's one-woman play, "The Syringa Tree," winner of
off-Broadway's 2001 Obie Award for best play, makes its Los Angeles
debut Friday at the Pasadena Playhouse. From her first appearance as
a 6-year-old child on a swing, Gien (in some performances here)
portrays 24 characters, young and old, black and white. Laughing,
crying, singing and dancing, she is alternately her parents, their
servants, Afrikaans preachers praying for rain, and whites and blacks
torn apart by apartheid.</LD>
<TE>   Offstage, she appears far more inhibited. Gien, 45, talks in a
quiet, sometimes barely audible voice, seeming almost overwhelmed by
her play's success. Now finishing a screenplay and a novel based on
the play, the slight, elegant actress gets teary-eyed speaking of the
night Oprah Winfrey came to a performance in New York, calls her play
"the little engine that could" and notes that she is keeping a
"gratitude journal."</TE>
<TE>   Like her theatrical stand-in, Gien grew up in luxury in a
Johannesburg suburb. One of her black nannies did actually give birth
to a child at Gien's family home.  Her physician father was indeed
required to have separate consulting rooms for white and black
patients -- each room with its own staircase and entry. And the
central action in her play, the murder of her grandfather by a
Rhodesian rebel, is true.</TE>
<TE>   Also culled from memory are Gien's convent school visits to less
fortunate schoolchildren, and her experiences as a university student
at the time of the Soweto uprising of 1976. But Gien prefers not to
differentiate fact from fiction. Her play is "semiautobiographical,"
she says. "It is a fictional story that's deeply invested with my
feeling about my life."</TE>
<TE>   When Gien first started on the play, Gien says, she used not only
her own name but also exact names and places. "But I didn't feel
relaxed about writing that way. I discovered when I changed certain
things and allowed myself to write in a fictional way, I had much
more freedom to be expressive and poetic. I had a much wider canvas."</TE>
<TE>   That canvas, set largely in '60s South Africa, couldn't be much
more dramatic, adds Susan Dietz, who will open "The Syringa Tree" at
Beverly Hills' Canon Theatre a few days after it closes in Pasadena.
"You're completely with her, and at the end, you've lived a life,"
Dietz says. "Her versatility is extraordinary as an actress, but it's
the storytelling that's so magical."</TE>
<TE>   A grandfather's tale</TE>
<TE>   Gien's play grew out of a storytelling exercise in 1996 when Los
Angeles acting teacher Larry Moss told Gien and her classmates to
turn to the person next to him or her and tell a story. "He said it
could be something that happened today at the bank or something that
happened a long time ago," Gien recalls. "And as I turned to the
person next to me, the story of what happened on my grandfather's
farm [in 1967] came roaring into my mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I hadn't thought about it for 30 years -- we never talked about
it in my family -- and I have no idea why it came into my mind. I
actually shuddered because it came so strongly, and just as I thought
I'd try to think of something else, Larry said, 'Don't censor
whatever it is that just came into your mind. Tell that story. It
will choose you.'</TE>
<TE>   "So I began to tell, as much as I could bear, about my thoughts
driving home from my grandfather's funeral after he was attacked on
his farm. I was about 10 years old then, and sitting in Larry's class
as an adult, recounting those thoughts, I realized I was trying to
make sense of the unimaginable and trying to put some logic to what
had happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I went home after class, and I was remembering so many things
that were long-forgotten. The floodgates of memory were opening."</TE>
<TE>   This time was different</TE>
<TE>   The next part of the class was to stage the story she'd told. Gien
had acted in South African television and theater before coming to
the U.S. in 1984. She spent a year on ABC's "One Life to Live" and
was a principal member of the American Repertory Theatre company in
Cambridge, Mass., for five seasons. But those and other acting jobs
were different -- neither the stories nor the writing was hers.</TE>
<TE>   Encouraged by the class' reaction to her 20-minute presentation --
her classmates were on their feet, crying, she says -- she started
writing first a screenplay, then a play. "I never had the confidence
to write anything myself before, but I began to write," she says. "I
wept a lot as I wrote. I laughed a lot. Then, at the end of six or
seven weeks, I brought the material to Larry."</TE>
<TE>   Moss insisted that Gien perform the piece alone, tossed out her
props and helped her develop the piece that he later would direct. "I
think that Pamela, by writing this play, found her love of South
Africa and understood why she left, forgave herself for leaving and
allowed herself to be the first-rate artist she was always meant to
be," Moss says. "She has great drive, great intelligence, enormous
heart, and she's not afraid to work."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, they were doing invited run-throughs at Moss' studio. Within
a few months, Gien's agent had sent her screenplay to Matt Salinger,
an actor-turned-film-producer, who says he came to a run-through
expecting a group of actors reading a screenplay and instead found
one woman performing a theater piece. "I got chills within five
minutes," says Salinger, who went on to produce the play in Seattle,
New York, London and on tour. "What she does onstage is so remarkable
that I honestly didn't look at the screenplay again until last year."</TE>
<TE>   After several more months of development, the show finally
premiered in February 1999 at A Contemporary Theatre in Seattle.
Seattle venture capitalists Howard Schultz, founder of Starbucks, and
Dan Levitan came in financially, says Salinger, who next set about
trying to find a theater in New York. And when "Syringa" opened in
September 2000 at Playhouse 91 on New York's Upper East Side,
Salinger devoted himself to finding an audience.</TE>
<TE>   The show struggled at first, and, he concedes, there was one rainy
night when he counted 17 people in the 300-seat theater. Salinger,
the son of reclusive novelist J.D. Salinger, says they "hemorrhaged
money for a couple weeks," but the situation soon improved.</TE>
<TE>   Then came largely positive reviews and Gien's appearance on "The
Rosie O'Donnell Show." After seeing the show, Moss' students Hilary
Swank, Jason Alexander, Helen Hunt and others provided passionate
blurbs for Salinger's direct-mail solicitations. "People would come
see it, then tell their friends," Salinger says.</TE>
<TE>   Gien was succeeded after the first year off-Broadway by actress
Kate Blumberg. Actresses Eva Kaminsky and Gin Hammond will alternate
performances with Gien in Southern California, then without her on
the rest of a two-year tour through the United States and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very difficult at first to hand it over," she says. "But
Matt said, 'You have to allow other people to perform it to let the
play live. If you always have to do it, it won't have the life it
could have or should have.' "</TE>
<TE>   Gien says she was recently asked to act in a film but declined
because of her other commitments. She's completing a screenplay, "The
Lily Field," which she describes as a contemporary mystery thriller
about a family and lost child, set in America.</TE>
<TE>   She's also completing her screenplay of "Syringa Tree" and a novel
of it, commissioned by Random House.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like this play has brought me home in so many ways," Gien
says. "A lot of people who were early supporters will be able to see
it fully formed. It feels like a real celebratory homecoming."</TE>

<HD>The real Diana Krall is liberated on 'Live in Paris'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Diana Krall's career has unfolded in such spectacular fashion during
the past few years that it's almost nit-picking to suggest that she
might have done anything better or differently. With millions of
albums sold, a Grammy nomination for album of the year (almost
unheard-of for a jazz artist) and a Grammy Award for best jazz vocal
album, she would seem to have accomplished more in a few years than
most jazz performers could dream of achieving in a lifetime.</LD>
<LD>   But Krall's new album, "Live in Paris" (*** 1/2, Verve), raises a
few intriguing doubts about her previous albums. Released almost as
an afterthought to a DVD/video concert performance, it displays a
Krall who was only rarely present in her previous two studio albums,
"When I Look in Your Eyes" and "The Look of Love." Those CDs
certainly represent jazz singing at an extremely high level, but
their elaborate production and multicolored layers of sound allowed
very little room for the spontaneous, brilliantly off-the-cuff
vocalizing and solid piano work that make "Live in Paris" such a
remarkable release.</LD>
<TE>   Krall's vocal style has always been idiosyncratic, more comparable
to what instrumentalists do with their horns. Occasionally swallowing
words, accenting phrases through subtle shifts of vocal timbre, she
has gradually transformed these qualities into dramatic devices to
emphasize a song's story without sacrificing an underlying sense of
inherent swing. Too often, in her previous two releases, the rough
but attractive edges of her vocals were smoothed out, and rhythmic
propulsion was occasionally sacrificed in favor of lush, orchestral
timbres.</TE>
<TE>   Not so here. Although she sings several tunes from "The Look of
Love," only two are performed with orchestral accompaniment. And it
is fascinating to contrast the small ensemble versions performed live
and the strings-heavy counterparts on the studio album. Very simply,
Krall performs as though she has been liberated, singing with obvious
joy, occasionally tossing in a humorous sidebar comment, scatting
here and there, and offering great, swinging chunks of the piano work
that was so minimized in "The Look of Love."</TE>
<TE>   It's not news that Krall's success has driven record companies to
search far and wide for young, white, female jazz vocalists. The
results have been, at best, uneven. The most successful of the
post-Krall singers has been Norah Jones -- recording for the jazz
label Blue Note, but producing an album that is essentially
country-oriented. Verve -- Krall's company -- has also signed Lizz
Wright, the rare African American performer in the new wave of
singers, but her first album has yet to be released.</TE>
<TE>   Here are recent arrivals delineating the range of material coming
down the pipe:</TE>
<TE>   Eden Atwood</TE>
<TE>   "Waves: The Bossa Nova Session"</TE>
<TE>   ***, Groove Note</TE>
<TE>   Sweet-voiced Atwood, who has gone through a number of not
particularly successful career phases, is particularly well suited
for a program ranging from Antonio Carlos Jobim classics to bossa
nova renderings of Lennon &amp; McCartney's "Fool on the Hill" and Irving
Berlin's "How Deep Is the Ocean." It would have been nice for her to
explore a wider range of material.</TE>
<TE>   But what really makes Atwood's interpretations so appealing is the
emotional authenticity she brings to every number.</TE>
<TE>   Tierney Sutton</TE>
<TE>   "Something Cool"</TE>
<TE>   ***, Telarc</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based Sutton has been quite visible lately, and with
good cause. She has been well served by the opportunity to work with
a regular group that includes pianist Christian Jacob, bassist Trey
Henry and drummer Ray Brinker. Given that empathic interaction, she
ventures through an extraordinarily diverse collection of material: a
romping "Route 66," a new variation on the June Christy-associated
"Something Cool," three tunes from Lerner &amp; Loewe's "My Fair Lady," a
touching version of Duke Ellington's "Reflections" and a joyously
scat-driven take on Harburg and Arlen's "Ding-Dong! The Witch Is
Dead."</TE>
<TE>   Wesla Whitfield</TE>
<TE>   "The Best Thing for You Would Be Me: The Irving Berlin Songbook"</TE>
<TE>   ***, High Note</TE>
<TE>   If anyone deserves the label "cabaret jazz singer," it's
Whitfield. Her primary merit is the ability to perfectly articulate
both the words and the messages in her material, while delivering her
lines with a brisk rhythmic undercurrent. But most of the jazz
aspects of her recordings and performances stem from the presence of
husband Mike Greensill at the piano. For this outing, he has
assembled a somewhat larger ensemble featuring saxophonist Gary
Foster and trombonist Marty Wehner to explore a 17-song collection of
Berlin classics, most of which are offered with their rarely heard
verses.</TE>
<TE>   Meredith d'Ambrosio</TE>
<TE>   "Love Is for the Birds"</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2, Sunnyside</TE>
<TE>   Neither Whitfield nor D'Ambrosio exactly fits the "young" vocalist
label, but both have built steady careers by remaining true to their
artistic convictions. In D'Ambrosio's case, that approach results in
some thorny but compelling music. All the tracks here are originals
-- either written by her, or her lyrics added to existing
compositions. The collaborations include Kenny Dorham's "Rhyme of
Spring (Poetic Spring)," Harold Land's "That Magic Rapture (Rapture)"
and Clifford Brown's "Daahoud." D'Ambrosio's calm, almost
expressionless voice is an acquired taste, but there's no denying the
adventurous qualities of her songs.</TE>
<TE>   Banu Gibson &amp; Bucky Pizzarelli</TE>
<TE>   "Steppin' Out"</TE>
<TE>   ***, Swing Out Records</TE>
<TE>   Terry Blaine</TE>
<TE>   "Lonesome Swallow"</TE>
<TE>   ***, Jukebox Jazz</TE>
<TE>   Gibson and Blaine are well-established interpreters of the music
of the '20s and '30s, approaching numbers such as "Steppin' Out With
My Baby," "Put the Blame on Mame," "Am I Blue" and "Jeepers Creepers"
with great stylistic accuracy. That said, there's nothing musty or
worn about either performance.</TE>
<TE>   Blaine, on her fifth recorded project with pianist Mark Shane, has
loads of fun with Andy Razaf double-entendre numbers such as "My
Handy Man" before shifting into the easygoing lyricism of "100 Years
From Today."</TE>
<TE>   Gibson has a bit more of a contemporary quality to her readings,
and one of the album's many appealing aspects is her jaunty
interaction with guitarist Pizzarelli.</TE>
<TE>   Keely Smith</TE>
<TE>   "Keely Swings Basie-Style"</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2, Concord Records</TE>
<TE>   Smith was never really a jazz artist, even in her salad years of
the '50s when she worked side by side with husband Louis Prima. But
her deadpan delivery and focused melodic lines worked well in the
quasi-jazz settings of the decade's lounge music. Starting up her
career again recently, she has made a series of recordings that are
essentially revivalist interpretations. Unlike Gibson and Blaine,
however, Smith's renderings do sound a bit musty, despite the strong
backup from an orchestra of L.A. studio all-stars. That probably
won't matter for lounge fans, of course, but others may have problems
with Smith's monochromatic style, as well as the disconcerting
Southern-belle accent with which she delivers phrases such as the
opening line of "You Go to My Head."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent).</TE>

<LD>Just when you thought the stock market was rebounding and it was safe
to wear Givenchy and pay 40 bucks for an entree again, comes this
stunning dispatch from the pop-culture front lines: There are poor
people among us! What's more, downward mobility can be diverting!
America, which usually prefers the champagne fizz of success, is
sampling the malt-liquor authenticity and reverse-snob appeal of TV
shows, rap tunes, fashion spreads and other cultural tributes to the
burger-flipping classes.</LD>
<LD>   In less time than it takes to say "Au revoir, 401(k)!," we've gone
from groveling at the feet of Bill Gates to aping Lil' Abner.</LD>
<LD>   But does this new infatuation with the lifestyles of the penniless
and desperate reflect shifting social values -- a break with the
go-go, gaga '90s and a touch of empathy for the 32 million Americans
now living in poverty? Or is it a fashionably jaded form of
exploitation?</LD>
<TE>   Consider the conflicting evidence:</TE>
<TE>   Nappy Roots, a hip-hop sextet from rural Kentucky, has gone gold
with its CD "Watermelon, Chicken &amp; Gritz," a witty, straight-up
exploration of the mixed blessings of being a have-not. No
city-slicker rhymes for these guys about posses, stretch limos and
gangsta profilin'. That stuff, explains group member Skinny DeVille
in the rapper's down-home patois, is as passe as Y2K.</TE>
<TE>   "When Clinton was in office, man, everything was good," DeVille
says. "The economy was excellent. There was a lot of jobs out there,
folks was working. Right now it ain't at all like that no more.
People aren't spending on certain things that was frivolous. Time to
take care of your own right now."</TE>
<TE>   DeVille's colleague Big V remembers growing up so poor that he had
to wear his sports uniforms to school in lieu of new clothes. "We
used to think money was white. You know, like: 'Put that down, boy!
We ain't white!' But we always had each other, and that's what I like
to rap about, was my family being there, and my auntie chipping in,
and my uncle doing what he could afford."</TE>
<TE>   Nappy Roots' blue-collar identity is real, but pop culture doesn't
always treat poverty so charitably. Often, its response is more
ambiguous. In the halls of CBS, plans are underway to remake the '60s
sitcom "The Beverly Hillbillies" as a "reality TV" show. According to
a story in the Washington Post, program developers are scouring
Appalachia's hills and hollers looking for a Clampett-like clan to
relocate to a Westside mansion for at least a year, where they'll
grapple with the plot-propelling mysteries of hiring maids, driving
fancy cars and, no doubt, that ol' cee-ment pond.</TE>
<TE>   CBS insists that its remake -- using real, live hillbillies --
will aspire to "social commentary" and be more about skewering
pretensions of the rich than making hay out of hapless rubes.</TE>
<TE>   'Dust-bowl glamour'</TE>
<TE>   But what are we to make of the New Yorker's recent fashion layout,
in which photographer Herb Ritts poses hollow-cheeked models in
clothes and backdrops that make them look like Okie refuges from the
Great Depression? "Fashion has been looking over its shoulder again,"
says the upscale magazine's breathless text. "Designers have drawn on
both the glitter and the squalor of the [1930s] -- satin shoes and
dusty dungarees, gimlets and dry rot -- and the result is something
like dust-bowl glamour."</TE>
<TE>   One model, a weather-beaten Pa Joad impersonator, sports an
artfully soiled Dolce &amp; Gabbana undershirt beneath his bib overalls.
Another photo of a woman's legs in tattered stockings tapering to a
pair of Manolo Blahnik crocodile-and-leopard-print pony skin pumps,
coyly alludes to a similar photograph by Dorothea Lange, who pricked
America's conscience with her haunting images of real poor people,
the Steinbeckian migrants who flocked to California's fruited plains
in search of hope and a living wage.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Ritts' concept is tasteless and insensitive, or a clever
jab at America's historic habit of following fat times with sharp
economic reversals, is a question of interpretation. But Judy Keller,
who curated a current exhibition of Lange's photographs at the Getty
Museum in Brentwood, including the iconic "Migrant Mother," doesn't
think Ritts should be able to have his postmodern-ironist's cornbread
and eat it too.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Outrageous' is the first word that comes to mind," says Keller,
an associate curator in the Getty's department of photographs. "He is
using the idea of poverty and a Depression context to show current
couture fashions. I would say it's totally out of whack."</TE>
<TE>   Americans have always been schizoid about the morality of material
success, or its lack. We venerate Lincoln's humble,
character-building roots, but given the choice most of us would
probably prefer to be strolling the gardens at Monticello or
water-skiing at Hyannisport than reading by log-cabin candlelight.
Unless our parents picked cotton in Texas or scooped strawberries in
Salinas we may easily forget that we're only a generation or two away
from plucking chickens or mining coal for a living.</TE>
<TE>   That's one of the points raised in "Nickel and Dimed," the stage
adaptation of Barbara Ehrenreich's bestselling, first-person odyssey
of trying to survive in minimum-wage America. (The show just finished
its run at the Mark Taper Forum.)</TE>
<TE>   But for all its scathing observations about the grinding nature of
the modern service economy, "Nickel and Dimed" doesn't let the author
claim the hero's mantle. The Ehrenreich character (played by Sharon
Lockwood) is constantly questioning her right to judge the difficult
decisions confronting the working poor and her ethical duties as a
journalist-observer.</TE>
<TE>   As she should. Even as trenchant a social critic as George Orwell,
author of "1984," was criticized for his stunningly matter-of-fact
observations about working-class hygiene in "The Road to Wigan Pier."
("The lower classes smell," he wrote. "That's what we were taught.")</TE>
<TE>   But Orwell cited his own prejudices to show how stereotypes of the
working poor get instilled. What distinguishes his essays and the
photos of Lange -- a federal government employee who was trying to
bring attention to a burning social problem -- from that of their
blushing imitators is motivation. Without social consciousness and a
commitment at some level to improve the lot of the working poor,
cultural depictions of poverty, whether in a sitcom or a fine-art
exhibition, can become just a proletarian pose -- a kind of Populist
drag show.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the line is, how good is it as art, in terms of its
powers of communication?" Keller says. "If it moves you, if it is
good enough for you to understand it and therefore have an emotional
response to it, that is a sympathetic response to it, I think that it
is not exploitation."</TE>
<TE>   The culture of poverty has its price, all right. But who pays? A
print of "Migrant Mother" was scheduled for sale last week at
Christie's auction house. It was expected to fetch up to $200,000.</TE>

<HD>Big deal on remake street: It's deja vu all over again</HD>
<DH>Critics may carp, but studios count on moviegoers' amnesia
about the originals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Maynard</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are no new stories, goes the Hollywood adage. Joseph Campbell
laid out a finite series of archetypes; Shakespeare stole from his
predecessors and contemporaries. But this month, the studios have
counted on audiences to become complete amnesiacs with six movie
remakes.</LD>
<LD>   While some critics carped, moviegoers haven't seemed to mind that
"Red Dragon," the prequel to "The Silence of the Lambs" by Thomas
Harris, had been filmed previously (by Michael Mann as "Manhunter" in
1986).</LD>
<LD>   Audiences have already forgotten September's "The Four Feathers,"
in at least its sixth screen incarnation. Most young adults know that
this month's "Tuck Everlasting" is based on Natalie Babbitt's novel
about immortality, but a 1980 indie version might as well be dead.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a presumption today's audience hasn't seen the original
first," says film critic Leonard Maltin. "And that includes 'Red
Dragon,' which was just made 16 years ago.... [Studios] count on
general ignorance of the original."</TE>
<TE>   In "The Truth About Charlie," Jonathan Demme's update of the 1963
Paris-set romantic thriller "Charade," the May-December pairing of
Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant morphed into an interracial romance
between Thandie Newton and Mark Wahlberg.Demme, who got original
director Stanley Donen's blessing, says, "I thought it would be
perfectly all right to take these characters and shake them up and
change them around."</TE>
<TE>   Demme took his film a step further by paying homage to the French
New Wave with cameos from director Agnes Varda, actress Anna Karina
and singer Charles Aznavour.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true that When Stanley Donen and his fabulous cast were
shooting 'Charade,' Claude Chabrol and Jean-Luc Godard really were
right around the corner," Demme says.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign films frequently fuel remakes. Throughout the late 1980s
and early '90s, Hollywood ransacked French farces to make its own
("Three Men and a Baby," "Down and Out in Beverly Hills," "Cousins").
This month featured three imports. Two were based on Italian films:
"Welcome to Collinwood," a update of the 1958 heist comedy "Big Deal
on Madonna Street," and "Swept Away," a new version of Lina
Wertmuller's 1975 satire of sexual politics, starring Madonna and
directed by husband Guy Ritchie. "The Ring," an Americanization of
the 1998 Japanese horror film, opened last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   In remaking "Madonna Street," "Collinwood" directors Anthony and
Joe Russo transferred the action from the slums of Rome to Cleveland.
Even so, they had their work cut out for them. There's already been a
failed Broadway musical (Bob Fosse's "Big Deal"), a movie that
flopped despite the presence of director Louis Malle and Sean Penn
("Crackers") and a couple of other films that shared its influence
("Palookaville," "Small Time Crooks").</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, this film might have been remade more than any other,"
says Anthony Russo. "I think that when people attempt remakes ...
they were moved or felt some kind of connection to the original
story."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from Madonna being box-office poison, another factor in the
flop of "Swept Away" may be that times and tastes have changed. The
earlier version came out at the peak of the feminist movement,
shocking observers with its story of a chauvinist sailor who turns a
spoiled rich woman into his love slave. Ritchie's version "doesn't
have the teeth the original did," Maltin says."The Ring" had
significantly less of a marketing challenge. The original's cult
status sparked interest across the Internet for its chilling hook: a
videotape of nightmarish images followed by a phone call that
foretells the viewer's death.</TE>
<TE>   The premise spooked producers Walter F. Parkes and Laurie
MacDonald enough to buy the rights to the original within hours of
watching a second-generation VHS copy.</TE>
<TE>   While they tried to stay true to the source, "the original is very
abstract in the middle of the movie," MacDonald says, "and it kind of
comes together. It's intriguing ... , but it would definitely be
confusing to an American audience." More remakes are coming. Get
ready for "Pinocchio" starring Roberto Benigni; "The Quiet American";
"Bob le Flam- beur" (as "The Good Thief"); "The Italian Job"; and
"The Ladykillers" directed by the Coen brothers and starring Tom
Hanks. If any of these makes you feel old, consider this: The teen
genre, which has pillaged George Bernard Shaw ("She's All That") and
Shakespeare ("O," "Ten Things I Hate About You"), has turned on
itself. Warner Bros. is prepping an African American redux of the
1986 comedy "Can't Buy Me Love."</TE>
<TE>   Even Hitchcock redid Hitchcock ("The Man Who Knew Too Much" in
1934 and 1956) with legions of fans still arguing over which was
better. Is any source material fair game?</TE>
<TE>   "Usually I cringe," Maltin says. "Frankly, I don't know if anyone
who saw Adam Sandler's movie ["Mr. Deeds"] went out to get Frank
Capra's movie ["Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"]. But you never know. I
hasten to remind people 'His Girl Friday' is a remake [of "The Front
Page"] and that's possibly the greatest American comedy of all time."</TE>

<HD>Pandora's box, opened</HD>
<DH>John Baldessari once proclaimed painting dead. However, his
new work acknowledges the medium's renewed significance. So, are his
acolytes paying any attention?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Knight</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In June, a Berlin-based curator named Jens Hoffman opened an
exhibition at the Project, a lively gallery in a downtown L.A.
warehouse. The show's format was somewhere between a diary and a
daisy chain.</LD>
<LD>   Over the course of 11 weeks, Hoffman added artists to his show. By
the final day, when the gallery space was full and a closing party
was held, the curator had chosen 44 entries.</LD>
<LD>   No. 40 was Mark Roeder. His contribution consisted of a short,
typed letter. "Dear Jens," it began. "I ask that the following
artists' and/or organizations' contributions be removed and further
excluded from the exhibition" -- whereupon there appeared a list of
eight names.</LD>
<TE>   Roeder's cheeky contribution is a classic gesture of Conceptual
art -- textual, ephemeral, humorous, acutely aware of its context,
devoid of visual interest, mechanically produced, eloquent as an idea
but not as an object. It embodies many of the hallmarks of work from
the Conceptualist upheaval that began to stir internationally in the
1950s and that finally took off in the 1960s and early 1970s. In
fact, if a visitor to the Project encountered Roeder's piece and
didn't know better, he might have thought it was 1972, not 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Or, maybe even 1971. That was the year John Baldessari, the most
important artist Hoffman invited to be in the Project exhibition,
completed a now legendary work for a show in Canada. Back then,
Baldessari had a simple plan. There were no funds for him to travel
to the gallery at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. So, he
instructed a group of students there to write: "I will not make any
more boring art" on the gallery's walls, over and over, as if they
were a class of budding Bart Simpsons.</TE>
<TE>   Boring your audience was a cardinal sin, the work declared.
Indeed, Conceptual art had been born of a conviction that, after a
hundred years of experiment, established modern forms of sculpture
and -- especially -- painting were stuck in a deep rut.
Conceptualism, by suppressing art's dependence on physical form,
might break up the logjam.</TE>
<TE>   For the Project show, Baldessari assigned the 31-year-old Nova
Scotia exhortation once again -- but with a twist. This time, it
wasn't aspiring young artists who were cautioned, but the
exhibition's curator. Hoffman dutifully covered blackboards with
repeated promises: "I will never curate any more boring shows."</TE>
<TE>   Baldessari's curatorial tutorial at the blackboard is a partly
funny, partly impatient gesture, aimed at prodding the institutional
art world. "I think what [Hoffman] was getting at with the show,"
Baldessari said while munching a tostada at a neighborhood restaurant
near his Santa Monica studio the other day, "was finding descendants
of Conceptual art and trying to identify that in art here." The
problem: L.A. art has left that division behind.</TE>
<TE>   The young Berlin curator wrote at the start of the show's catalog,
"One detail about the L.A. art scene I noticed quite early in my
research was that painting and sculpture still have such a strong
position.... I really thought that Conceptual [art] would have washed
all of that away."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than embrace his encounter with the unexpected, however,
Hoffman averted his eyes. He included no painters in his show.</TE>
<TE>   The decision is telling. The show reflects an international status
quo, which Baldessari's own radical career has been instrumental in
establishing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of like Dr. Frankenstein," the artist, now 71, concedes,
simultaneously distraught and amused by the thought. "I didn't know,"
he deadpans, assuming the croaking, confessional style of the mad
scientist in an old monster movie. "If only I had known! I meant
well!"</TE>
<TE>   New art in Los Angeles is characterized by its freewheeling
pluralism. Meanwhile, Conceptual art isn't what it used to be.</TE>
<TE>   In the '60s and '70s, Baldessari said, "it was a useful term for a
lot of artists who were trying to get away from painting primarily,
and sculpture secondarily. So then, you knew what Conceptual art
meant. It meant you didn't paint."</TE>
<TE>   Painting still bedevils most curators and academics. Baldessari
started as a painter, and painting lurks in the wings of much of his
art from the past 35 years. It's the unacknowledged elephant in the
Conceptual art room.</TE>
<TE>   Rules were made to be broken</TE>
<TE>   Born in the working-class San Diego suburb of National City in
1931, the son of European immigrants, Baldessari majored in art at
San Diego State College, minored in literature and took courses in
philosophy. (He remains an inveterate reader today, his studio piled
with books.) For a year he studied art history at UC Berkeley, before
returning to San Diego to finish a master's degree in art, which he
received in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   For a decade Baldessari flailed around artistically. He painted
landscapes and gestural abstractions, used photographs as source
material, employed billboard fragments as painting surfaces and more.
None of it really satisfied him -- or anyone else, for that matter.
But living in San Diego helped make experimentation possible. He was
far from New York -- modern art central -- and far enough from the
nascent art scene in L.A. not to have to concern himself with fitting
in. He had nothing to lose.</TE>
<TE>   Equally important, Baldessari taught, at California Youth
Authority, in high schools, at the college level. He's been a
sought-after teacher ever since, including as a pivotal founding
faculty member at CalArts, where he worked from 1970 to 1988, and now
at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Being in the academy confronted Baldessari with the thorny issue
of rules for art. What makes a painting good or bad, enlightening or
banal, a success or a flop? Beyond stretched canvas and paint, in
fact, what distinguishes a painting from other interesting, appealing
pictures and objects in the world? Why was one thing art, and another
not?</TE>
<TE>   There were textbooks that laid out answers, and they became source
material for Baldessari's unconventional paintings. When combined
with his nothing-to-lose attitude, the question of rules became
volatile.</TE>
<TE>   Typical is an enticing 1967 canvas titled "Wrong," now in the
collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The central image
is a black-and-white photograph of the 6-foot-7 artist shown standing
before a palm tree. Printed below in black capital letters is the
single word, "WRONG."</TE>
<TE>   The text explains the image, as if it were an illustration in a
how-to book. It's wrong to compose a photograph by placing a person
in front of a tree, because then it looks like the tree is growing
out of the person's head.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not all that's wrong with "Wrong." In 1967, it violated
a long list of established rules for good painting. The image is
photographic, not hand-painted. Nor is it abstract. Color has
vanished. The text, which Baldessari hired out to a commercial sign
painter, does not actualize the artist's inner life or represent a
process of nature. The painting's smallish size does not encompass a
viewer's visual field, because it was determined by the size of the
door in the van Baldessari used to cart the work to the sign
painter's shop. In fact, the only signals left that say "Wrong" is
indeed a painting are the conventional materials: Paint has been
applied to stretched canvas.</TE>
<TE>   Soon Baldessari dispensed with that too. He began to make text
works, shoot videotapes, cut found photographs into provocative
shapes and assemble unrelated stills from obscure B movies, which
later became big, baroque composites that seem to harbor strange,
epic narratives. In the process Baldessari was instrumental in
smashing the international painting cartel that ruled Modern art.</TE>
<TE>   Today it's difficult to recall the ferocity of the fight, circa
1970, but Baldessari has a clear picture of the battlefield in his
mind. "Graphically," he says, "it was described in the seating at
Max's Kansas City" -- the era's hip club for artists in New York,
where "the painters sat on one side, the Minimal and Conceptual
artists sat on another, and the Warhol crowd sat in back."</TE>
<TE>   The painters lost the fight. Partly that's because they
represented the establishment -- which, in the age of Vietnam, civil
rights struggles and Watergate, wasn't where an artist wanted to be.
Partly the thrilling force of new ideas just overran them --
Post-Minimalism, earth art, performance, video, feminist art and
more. And partly it was economic fate.</TE>
<TE>   The late 1950s and 1960s experienced something new in American
artistic life: the emergence of an active commercial market for
contemporary art, from Leo Castelli Gallery in New York to Ferus
Gallery in L.A. When that market collapsed in the recessionary waves
that battered the 1970s, traditional objects like paintings and
sculptures couldn't be sustained. But a dematerialized art based in
ideas could. Conceptualism flourished in the state-supported art
scene of Western Europe and in the school-supported art scene
developing in the United States, where a market didn't matter.
There's a reason Baldessari's 1971 pledge not to make "any more
boring art" was carried out by far-off students directed by telephone
and letter. It cost next to nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The renewal of painting</TE>
<TE>   Painting's death was widely asserted in the wake of Conceptual
art. Baldessari even held a funeral. At least, he held one for his
own paintings -- those he made before 1967 were ritually incinerated
at a San Diego crematorium in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   But his newest work pushes painting into the foreground, signaling
confidence in painting's renewed significance today. For his first
L.A. solo show in five years, currently at Margo Leavin Gallery in
West Hollywood, Baldessari is showing what he bluntly describes as
"occasions for painting."</TE>
<TE>   The "occasions" arise in the intersections between photographic
enlargements. Using a panorama camera, Baldessari was taking
landscape pictures. Then, quixotically turning the camera 90 degrees,
he realized the panorama best encompasses tall subjects, such as palm
trees or apartment buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The new works each assemble two or four linear panoramas, greatly
enlarged, into a square or cross. Where the photographs overlap, a
kind of double exposure is created. Inside this zone of camera chaos,
Baldessari paints the jumbled pattern of shapes, shadows and lines,
using flat acrylic colors. Although visually unique, these
provocative works immediately recall paintings by artists as diverse
as Matisse and Ellsworth Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's probably a hidden notion that, if you engage in
painting, that's known territory," Baldessari says of his
surreptitious methods for insinuating painting into Conceptual art,
which are now blatant. "It's not like 'there are dragons out there in
the mist,' you know? It's familiar territory."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Baldessari made big photographic composites whose
inventive mix of whimsy and power catapulted his career from cult
status into the stratosphere. They were composed from cropped and
altered B-movie stills, but their pictorial language derived from
17th and 18th century Baroque painting, re-imagined for an age of
cinema. "Bloody Sundae," for example, shows three men in the upper
frame with guns drawn, while lovers in bed fill the lower frame --
mere mortals held unwitting hostage to the caprice of wicked gods
above. Think Fragonard or Tiepolo.</TE>
<TE>   Still wrong after all these years</TE>
<TE>   There's little interesting art today -- including painting -- that
hasn't been informed by Conceptualism, but painting per se remains an
institutional whipping boy. (Alluding to the lingering queasiness
about the medium in institutional art circles, Baldessari groans and
says, "If I see one more refrigerator door that's meant to be
considered as a painting, I think I'll scream.") The Project
exhibition betrayed an almost pathological fear of paint. So do the
big national and international surveys, such as last spring's
paintings-poor Whitney Biennial and Germany's recently closed
Documenta 11.</TE>
<TE>   Documenta dismayed Baldessari, who found little to admire. His
favorite work was an enormous still-life painting by Luc Tuymans. The
Belgian artist's moody paintings of the mysteriously slain,
post-colonial Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba made a big
impact at the 2001 Venice Biennale. He was one of only three painters
invited to Documenta, where most of the 113 other artists employed
documentary methods of political art.</TE>
<TE>   "He might have done it perversely," Baldessari said of Tuymans'
huge still-life. "But you know the reason he was chosen for
[Documenta] is not because he's a painter, but because of his
[earlier political] subject matter. Me, I couldn't care less about
the content, I like his painting. I know there's suffering in the
world. I read the newspapers every day. I don't have to be told that
by art.</TE>
<TE>   "Metaphorically, it's like Christ nailed to the cross: I don't
want to see the nails in the hands, I want to see the ascension --
all the joy and the glory. Which I didn't see at Documenta."</TE>
<TE>   Baldessari's embrace of artistic pluralism is plainly not in sync
with today's dominant international state of affairs, where
fourth-generation Conceptual art still rules, and picto-phobia is
rife. Thirty-five years after "Wrong," it seems Baldessari is still
wrong.</TE>

<LD>Johnny Cash's work has always had a real-life feel that meant much to
me over the years ("At home and at peace," by Robert Hilburn, Oct.
20). There seemed to be a reassurance to his songs, even when dealing
with some tough issues.</LD>
<LD>   I've heard the story about Charlie Parker hanging around a jukebox
at one of the clubs he frequented, putting his coins in to play
country-western songs. When friends finally asked him, "Why do you
listen to that stuff?," he reportedly replied, "It's the stories,
man, it's the stories!" It's those stories and the way Johnny Cash
told them that was important to many of his fans.</LD>
<LD>   I'm a city guy and don't even know exactly where Folsom is, but I
understand what he means. Although primarily a classic and
straight-ahead jazz fan, I try to listen to other types of music that
are pleasurable and entertaining, rather than deprive myself by being
a narrow-band listener. Your article fired me up, informed me, and
brought some emotions and memories to the surface.</LD>
<TE>   I admire his courage in choosing guests for his TV program that
you mentioned. Johnny Cash had the courage then that many others are
now embarrassed to admit they hadn't.</TE>

<LD>I have been a fan of Johnny Cash since I was about 15, and I still
remember the first time I purchased one of his albums -- this was, by
the way, in about 1982.</LD>
<LD>   I greatly appreciated your honesty regarding his voice and health
condition as of late.</LD>
<LD>   As he has aged, his voice has changed, and yet, he still has great
things to say to all of us through his words and his interpretation
of what others have written.</LD>

<TE>   I grew up in Texas, where my brother played Johnny Cash, my dad
loved Hank Williams and Jimmy Rodgers, and I usually gravitated
toward Bob Dylan records and the old blues redone by the Animals or
the Rolling Stones.</TE>
<TE>   Reading your piece on Johnny Cash -- stopping to rest, talking
about the Virginia house and his musical plans -- and June Carter
Cash -- showing you the graves of her parents, even the vision of her
eating cornbread and milk late at night like my own parents used to
do -- I came away with a deep regard for this first family of country
music.</TE>
<TE>   Your piece was warm, bright and intuitive.</TE>
<TE>   The respect you have for the man, his wife and his legacy is
obvious. He has always deserved good things. Thank you for allowing
us a glimpse.</TE>

over 100 commercials for the Standard Oil Co. in the mid-'70s.</TE>
<TE>   The TV show was a most extraordinary experience. Having Eric
Clapton and Merle Haggard working in the Ryman Auditorium just
couldn't have happened without the catalyst known as Johnny Cash.</TE>
<TE>   We did the show live before an audience and also played all of the
music live -- full orchestra -- no lip sync or singing to a

<LD>I found Dave Hickey's essay ("Americans and cars: Love runs out of
gas," Oct. 13) an insightful look into our present-day predicament
with what he sees as our automotive love life. At the same time, I
think his view of our recent exhibition of automobiles is overly
influenced by his apparent anguish at discovering his car doesn't
love him anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Where, he asks, are "any of the cars we loved as works of art or
any vehicle at all that might have been paid out on time by a member
of the middle class?"</LD>
<LD>   I am certain that more than a few of your readers might have
wondered if the accompanying photographs, which clearly show the
oft-lusted-after Jaguar E-type as well as the humble Volkswagen
Beetle, were taken from the same exhibition being described.</LD>
<TE>   I must, however, take exception to Mr. Hickey's seriously
misleading assertion that the six cars we exhibited are "not well
designed" according to the Museum of Modern Art's own standards.</TE>
<TE>   The Cisitalia was for many years the only car in the collection
and considered by many auto enthusiasts to be the most beautiful car
ever designed by Pininfarina, if not the most beautiful car ever
made. My predecessor Arthur Drexler described it as "hollow, rolling
sculpture."</TE>
<TE>   The Ferrari Formula One is an extraordinary example of a type of
object we have always collected, one in which the exterior form is
dictated by function: to go as fast as possible and still keep four
wheels on the ground. The third car to enter the collection was the
Jaguar E-type. Despite Mr. Hickey's claims, the E-type was one of the
first sports cars designed for a mass market. It was also the first
car to be designed using aerodynamic calculations that prefigure
computer modeling.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, we did take stock of our small collection and note
that we had three European cars, all of which were sports cars, and
decided to broaden the collection to reflect more fully the scope of
automotive design. Although there are countless American
contributions to this history, our native sense of pragmatism is best
expressed in the Willy's Jeep.</TE>
<TE>   The Volkswagen Beetle, the first car to be produced globally to
the same specifications, is no less of a cultural icon than the Jeep.
Although neither the Jeep nor the Beetle was ever designed with
"beauty" in mind, they do have their own sense of beauty that comes
from being things incredibly well done.</TE>
<TE>   The Smart Car is a new chapter in automotive design. Like the
Volkswagen, the car was designed, by Swatch and Mercedes-Benz, to
provide basic transportation. The overall emphasis is sustainability,
getting 50 miles to the gallon through ingenious engineering without
looking like an automotive hair shirt.</TE>
<TE>   I am surprised Mr. Hickey didn't reflect more on the Smart Car,
given the tenor of his piece. Not only does it use so little fuel,
but it is also half the length of a standard American car. If he
could imagine the 405 with less traffic, the environment with
substantially fewer pollutants and the American economy without so
much imported gasoline, Mr. Hickey might just, well, fall in love.
Beep-beep.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Poor Mr. Hickey. He's been jilted at the altar of automobile love.
His essay made me feel pessimistic and cowardly about my own
devotion.</TE>
<TE>   So I took a drive in my Miata, along Mulholland Drive, with Jan
and Dean on the radio and the top down. Destination? A love-in at the
Van Nuys auto show.</TE>
<TE>   I saw the little old lady from Pasadena in her GTO; Mustang Sally,
who was late because she got a ticket; a little deuce coupe (but no
409); and, lo and behold, a daddy who relented and gave back the
T-bird!</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Hickey, please come to L.A. on a warm summer night. We'll
zoom-zoom up Angeles Crest to Mt. Wilson and watch the sun set. On
the way home, as the stars come out and the scent of sage fills my
Miata, you'll fall in love again and feel automobile romance,
optimism and courage.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we'll write a song about it. Maybe I'll let you drive.</TE>

<HD>Mongolian fiddle, cousin to the cello</HD>
<DH>The morin khuur, which has only two strings and no
fingerboard, is now being played by Yo-Yo Ma.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Victoria Looseleaf</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yo-Yo Ma's instrument of choice is a 300-year-old Stradivarius cello.
But you can't accompany a Mongolian long song on a Strad. For that,
you need a morin khuur.</LD>
<LD>   It has a long thin neck, a trapezoidal body, two soft nylon
(traditionally, horsehair) strings, no fingerboard and a peg box
carved in the shape of a horse head -- horses being the Mongols' best
friend. Similar instruments can be traced to the 14th century, and,
says Ma, a morin khuur sounds "intimate," more like a Baroque cello
than a modern steel-stringed model.</LD>
<LD>   Ma first encountered the instrument three years ago in Amsterdam,
where he says he fell in love with the sound and fell in with four
morin khuur players. "They let me try to play theirs and the first
thing I learned was that even though it has two strings as opposed to
the cello's four, it's not twice as easy to play, it's twice as
hard."</LD>
<TE>   Still, it was good practice. Since 1998, Ma has been a guiding
force behind the ongoing Silk Road Project, which explores
traditional and new music from the countries along the fabled Asia to
the Mediterranean trade routes -- China, Iran and everything in
between. On Friday, Ma and 12-plus musicians in the Silk Road
Ensemble bring the sound of the morin khuur and dozens of other
unusual instruments to Royce Hall.</TE>
<TE>   It took Ma five months to master his Mongolian fiddle. He says
when he first put bow (horsehair, again) to strings -- one thick, one
thin and tuned in fourths -- he couldn't even make a sound. "Eight
months later a group of Mongolian musicians I was working with gave
me a morin khuur, making it possible to practice."</TE>
<TE>   The hard part is the lack of a fingerboard. On a cello or a
violin, a player pushes a string against the board to create the
desired pitch. On a morin khuur, says Ma, "you either have to push
down with your fingernail or pull up on the string, making it harder
to play fast, shifting notes."</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect any cadenzas, then, when Ma demonstrates his prowess
as he accompanies singer Khongorzul Ganbaatar from Ulan Bator in
"Legend of Herlen," a piece the Silk Road Project commissioned from
contemporary composer Byambasuren Sharav. In long song, says Ma,
which was developed as a means of communication in the desert, the
singers take huge, deep breaths to sustain loud, extended phrases.
The work, true to Silk Road Project's dedication to East-West musical
fusion, also features trombones, piano and percussion.</TE>
<TE>   Just in case you miss hearing the Strad, don't worry. The ensemble
also plans to play a new piece from Iranian composer Kayhan Kalhor
that blends a Persian zither, a Japanese bamboo flute and Western
strings, including Ma on his main ax.</TE>
<TE>   And for die-hard classicists? There will be an off-the-Silk-Road
interlude, in which Ma and pianist Joel Fan perform Debussy's lush
cello sonata.</TE>

<HD>Few red flags over a blue streak</HD>
<DH>'NYPD Blue' pushes the language envelope again, introducing
a new expletive into its mix. The reaction? It's been mostly a chorus
of yawns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who grew up listening to comics like George Carlin and David
Steinberg in the 1970s developed a pretty good sense of language and
the words that were -- and weren't -- permissible to say on
television.</LD>
<LD>   Times change, however, as demonstrated by the fact that "NYPD
Blue" quietly added a particular barnyard epithet to its lexicon this
season -- one that loosely translated means "nonsense," at least
according to the dictionary -- and practically no one uttered a
discouraging word.</LD>
<LD>   "Because of the nature of the show, it goes right by," said
producer Steven Bochco, acknowledging that the term in question (an
eight-letter word used to describe the stuff cattle leave in the
field) has been used in each episode this fall, the long-running
police drama's 10th season. "The landscape has so changed people
don't even notice it.... If you didn't write anything about it, I
guarantee you, no one would say, 'Boo.' "</LD>
<TE>   A few critics did mention the compound word in passing, with most
hyphenating out the objectionable half, but that's been about it. An
ABC spokeswoman said the network has logged only a few phone
complaints thus far -- a decidedly ho-hum response, given that the
show's average weekly audience is close to 13 million people.</TE>
<TE>   A small confession here: I watched three episodes of "Blue"
without noticing the word myself and probably wouldn't have without
an e-mail from Jeff Marlin, a devoted viewer who lives in Valley
Village, Calif., who asked if there had been any public reaction to
the relaxed policy.</TE>
<TE>   Marlin, 45, said he was hardly shocked by the language, just
surprised there hadn't been any fuss given the hullabaloo that
followed the use of a more condensed expletive on "Chicago Hope" in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   (Anthony Edwards' character used the same word in last spring's
"ER" finale, to little fanfare.)</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the word is obscene anymore," Marlin said. "You
just have to know your audience. In police work, they aren't saying
'please' and 'thank you' to perps." Besides, he added, "If you watch
'The Sopranos,' 'NYPD Blue' is tame."</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, has long been Bochco's argument. Before the
series premiered in 1993, he suggested that the show needed to paint
with a broader palette to be realistic -- especially in light of the
R-rated material found on cable. When he asked this year again about
expanding "Blue's" vocabulary, ABC relented to a degree, noting that
the drama runs at 10 p.m. and its audience is by now quite familiar
with its content.</TE>
<TE>   Still, that concession shouldn't imply the network has abandoned
its oversight. Despite the decision to allow Bochco to run with the
bulls, as it were, network standards-and-practices executives vetoed
an attempt to switch to the term for horse droppings, leaving the
producers somewhat puzzled.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Munro, a UCLA linguistics professor, has certainly seen a
shift in attitudes on campus. She began publishing a slang collection
from interviews with students in 1988 and has updated the survey
every four years, most recently during the 2000-2001 school year.</TE>
<TE>   "From 1988 to '96, there was a tremendous change in the perceived
acceptability of these so-called bad words, " Munro said. With very
few exceptions, the students had "a greatly increased tolerance. They
thought it was amusing that people would find these words offensive."</TE>
<TE>   (The Times, by the way, takes a conservative line on coarse
language and generally does not publish such words.)</TE>
<TE>   Even groups that regularly decry the coarseness of prime-time
television have, almost by necessity, let concerns pertaining to
language slide a bit. The Parents Television Council, for example,
dropped words like "damn" and "butt" from its roster of objectionable
expressions a few years ago because they were so prevalent on
television.</TE>
<TE>   The aforementioned Steinberg, now an active commercial and TV
director, actually built a comedy routine around the expression now
being used on "NYPD Blue" during his stand-up days in the 1970s,
pointing out that the Webster's Dictionary -- by providing the
synonym "nonsense" -- had somehow found the one guy in the world who
clearly didn't know what it meant.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the word still possessed the power to shock. "It was
radical to say ... on stage live," he said. "I usually closed the set
with it. It used to polarize the audience, and it almost identified
you as a counterculture person. It's amazing how far we've come."</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg added that while there is a tendency to speak in terms
of decades, he detected a shift around the time of Watergate. His
routine, in fact, paid off with a reference to President Nixon
talking about Vietnam, saying that to call that policy "nonsense"
didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   Although conventions regarding language continue to evolve,
network executives stress that they operate under limitations because
their revenue comes almost exclusively from advertisers, who would
prefer not to alienate potential customers. By contrast, HBO is
ad-free, and the FX cable network -- home of "The Shield," the gritty
police drama that earned an Emmy this year for star Michael Chiklis
-- derives fees from subscribers in addition to advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Yet incremental changes, such as the one on "Blue," would appear
to carry scant risk. For starters, one can argue that many of those
viewers truly outraged by prime-time TV have either given up on the
networks or begun seeking solutions beyond self-censorship -- say,
TVGuardian, a set-top box designed to filter out objectionable
language from TV programs, videos and DVD movies.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the broadcast networks will push the envelope so
long as enough viewers tolerate it, and the ennui that greeted the
latest addition to "Blue's" jargon suggests that many will. It's also
worth remembering that in a world where Tony Soprano and his mob
regularly punctuate sentences with a certain multi-purpose invective,
even with their new ammunition, the cops on "NYPD Blue" still find
themselves outgunned.</TE>

<HD>TV, one of their nine lives</HD>
<DH>Actors like to diversify their roles and producers want
punch in new shows, so some familiar faces are appearing this fall in
unexpected places.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Maynard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In television, the prime-time genres tend to stay the same -- cop and
FBI dramas, family and single-girl sitcoms -- so in many cases what
makes shows stand out is surprising casting. Actors reinvent
themselves, and with successful shows, it's often a matter of
producers who look for ways to counter expectations. So as has been
the case in previous years, some not-so-fresh faces are turning up in
unanticipated places this fall.</LD>
<LD>   Mykelti Williamson knows a lot about reinvention. After working
steadily in small guest roles on television shows ("Hill Street
Blues," "China Beach"), he had to fight to get an audition for the
film role that made him famous, Southern hick turned unlikely
entrepreneur Bubba in the 1995 blockbuster "Forrest Gump." "I
threatened to leave my agent," he says. "I only got it through
persistence and putting my foot down."</LD>
<LD>   Since then he's worked regularly in film ("Waiting to Exhale,"
"Heat," Don King in "Ali"). After two unsuccessful returns to network
television (the short-lived television show "The Hoop Life" and "The
Fugitive"), it seemed as if the 42-year-old actor was destined to
stay in films.</LD>
<TE>   "With television, you can start out with great creators, and all
of a sudden they're so hot they're getting other offers and spreading
themselves so thin they bring in other people to cover for them. And
you end up doing a show that wasn't what you signed up for. And
that's the fear of television. It could evolve into this other
monster."</TE>
<TE>   But Williamson reconsidered when he was offered the idiosyncratic
role of "Fearless" Bobby Smith, a Desert Storm vet turned cop in
"Boomtown," NBC's edgy new cop drama from creator Graham Yost
("Speed," "Band of Brothers").</TE>
<TE>   "He is so talented," Williamson says of Yost. "And he's with us
every single day. If he's not on the set, he's in the office prepping
upcoming episodes and punching up story lines. But he's there. He's
accessible. And this is the first time where I've been with a
television cast where no one's groaning. Everybody's cool."</TE>
<TE>   Another draw for Williamson was the way "Boomtown" accurately
depicts the realities of being a black man in Los Angeles. In a
coming episode, Fearless is off duty and gets pulled over by cops in
another district simply because of his skin color.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to deal with Fearless' concept of freedom," the actor
says.</TE>
<TE>   "I got stopped earlier this year [by the police] and fortunately
they recognized me. But they had no reason to stop me. They just
pulled me over because they saw me black in a nice neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   TV and the working girl</TE>
<TE>   IF Williamson seemed set for a film career, Sara Rue appeared to
have a career staked out as a cliched best friend-sidekick. Instead
the 25-year-old supporting actress from the cult series "Popular" has
the title role as a sweet, single working-girl temp who gets promoted
to a permanent position in ABC's "Less Than Perfect." Rue got the
part after waiting 2 1/2 months from her initial audition. "They
auditioned everyone in Hollywood for this part," she says. "They had
every girl with every different body type, every age."</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to see why they went with Rue but also something of a
surprise. She's as cute and charming as one of the "Friends," but
she's not a size-0 stick figure. "It doesn't hurt for you to watch me
walk," Rue jokes. "Like you don't worry I'm gonna break. My character
doesn't want to look like the Calista Flockharts, like my character
on 'Popular' did. She's self-deprecating like everyone is, but she
has her own style and her own spirit. And I think that's good for
young women. Not everyone looks like a supermodel, and not everyone
wants to."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rue admits starring in a sitcom has made her all too aware
of media scrutiny, like a review that called her "plus-sized." "I'm a
size 10. That's not plus size! I just have to remember in real life
outside television I'm average if not smaller than most women in
America."</TE>
<TE>   Rue also says she's having a positive experience with ABC, a
network that paradoxically housed "domestic goddess" Roseanne for
nine years but put Gen-Xer Margaret Cho on a harrowing diet regime
while making her short-lived series "All American Girl." Cho
chronicled her experience in her stand-up concert "I'm the One That I
Want." "I'll never forget when she said she felt like [the network]
had a big poster of her body and a pointer going, 'These are the
problem areas!' " says Rue. "I think she was ahead of her time."</TE>
<TE>   Across the pond</TE>
<TE>   Oftentimes, English-speaking actors from other continents
jump-start their careers by joining American TV shows, such as
Aussies Simon Baker and Rachel Griffiths on CBS' "The Guardian" and
HBO's "Six Feet Under," respectively. This year, two well-known
British character actors are looking to make the transition on CBS
shows. Mark Addy, who played the lovelorn sidekick in "The Full
Monty," stars in the sitcom "Still Standing" as a blue-collar
Midwestern family man, while Marianne Jean-Baptiste, from the
London-set "Secrets &amp; Lies," plays a no-nonsense New York FBI
investigator on "Without a Trace."</TE>
<TE>   Though Addy's played his fair share of American working-class
stiffs since "Monty," including quintessential primitive male Fred
Flintstone in "Viva Rock Vegas," he says it's still difficult nailing
his character's Ralph Kramden-esque accent. "I've been working on it
a lot," he says. "In England, we have different vowel sounds and we
don't pronounce our Rs at all really. But you get to a point where
you just can either worry about the dialect or just try to give as
credible and funny a performance as you can."</TE>
<TE>   For Baptiste, the accent's not the hard part; in fact, she gets
plenty of practice hanging out with "Trace" co-stars Anthony LaPaglia
and Poppy Montgomery, both Australians who "basically speak in
American accents now." But she says she's been frustrated with people
who ask why an Oscar-nominated actress was deigning to do American
prime time. "I just think it's really narrow to look at TV in that
way," she says. "I come from Britain, where there isn't much film
made, so if you don't do theater or TV, you starve. And as an actor
you have to be challenged to express your artistry. And my way of
doing that is by doing different things."</TE>

<HD>Designs that conceal desire</HD>
<DH>The waist-nipping fashions of the 1950s -- and all they
represent -- are an integral part of the film 'Far From Heaven.' They
help to tell a story about repression and marital secrets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Booth Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not often in films today that costumes play a leading role. But
in "Far From Heaven," about a homemaker facing a marital crisis
against the backdrop of rigid, mid-century American society, perky
peplum jackets and crisp crinolines are the foil for suppressed
desires.</LD>
<LD>   Director Todd Haynes had clear ideas about costume styling from
the start, many inspired by the 1950s films of Douglas Sirk. "The
first image I got in my mind was of Julianne Moore in dark
sunglasses, with her red hair in a chiffon scarf, set against the
blue New England sky with the reds and oranges of fall around her. I
drew a sketch of it in marker and stuck it in front of me while I
wrote," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Cut to the opening shot. Along with the scarf and sunglasses,
Moore, who plays Cathy Whitaker, wears a demure green swing coat and
ladylike orange gloves. Dressed in autumnal tones, she embodies a
suburban world in which women are as much a part of the scenery as
are the falling leaves. Their households revolve around children and
hostessing, and their stiff girdles and enveloping furs seem designed
to rein in any selfish yearnings.</LD>
<TE>   To execute his vision, Haynes chose costume designer Sandy Powell,
with whom he worked on "Velvet Goldmine" (1998). Although she began
by having Moore try on vintage pieces, Powell ended up making all of
the film's costumes. "Things had to look new and fresh," she said.
"And we had to take into consideration that Julianne was changing
shape by the minute."</TE>
<TE>   Moore is a vision in full, flowerlike skirts, which did double
duty to disguise her pregnancy. The feminine silhouette with a
cinched waist -- the hallmark of Christian Dior's 1947 New Look that
trickled down even to the Sears catalog -- was a contrast to the
austere, wartime styles and reflected the idealized domesticity of
the era when many women returned to the home after working during
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Powell created some lavish pieces, especially the sexy-but-safe
copper-colored taffeta gown with three-quarter-length lace sleeves
that Cathy wears as hostess of a dinner party. But it is Cathy's
lavender scarf that has the greatest sartorial impact. A mere wisp of
silk chiffon, it is carried away by the wind into the hands of her
gardener, Raymond (Dennis Haysbert). That simple square of fabric
becomes a symbol of the yearning for freedom and true love of an
entire generation of women.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Cathy's best friend, Eleanor (Patricia Clarkson), is
outfitted in slim shift dresses and pencil skirts paired with boxy
jackets. "The film was set in 1957, a time when the silhouette was
changing.... The more fashionable look is worn by Eleanor," Powell
said. "But we didn't want Cathy to adhere to high fashion. She's a
middle-class New England housewife."</TE>
<TE>   The restrictive silhouette seems to mirror Eleanor's role as the
stalwart of polite society. She may pose as the best friend, but when
Cathy's relationship with the gardener sends tongues wagging in the
narrow-minded town, she shows her true character.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes plays with color throughout. To complement Cathy's
wardrobe, Raymond is costumed in warm tones, including an autumnal
plaid coat similar to one worn by Rock Hudson in Sirk's 1955 film
"All That Heaven Allows." But Cathy's husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid),
who has his own secret that threatens to disrupt his domestic bliss,
stands apart in cool blue-gray suits and fedoras.</TE>
<TE>   The shade of lipstick that Moore wears is Cherries in the Snow, a
1950s red that Revlon no longer sells but that makeup artists can
still get. And, although Haynes wrote the role with Moore as a
redhead, she chose to wear a blond wig. "Julianne saw Cathy as such
an American girl in a warmly generic sense that red seemed too exotic
a hair color for her," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The clothing says a lot, as did the fashions of the Eisenhower
era. Life looked and seemed ideal -- handsome men with shiny wingtips
and shinier hair and doll-faced women in bell-shaped skirts and
waist-nipping jackets designed to emphasize every child-bearing
asset. But under the surface, the forces of change were bubbling up.</TE>
<TE>   The costumes in "Far From Heaven" work to create a snapshot of
America teetering on the edge. As Haynes said, "They suggest
something else without showing it to you. Because the more you go in
the direction of beauty, the more claustrophobic and repressive this
society appears."</TE>

<LD>The lyrics: "Friday night is party time, feeling ready looking fine,
Viene Diego rumbeando with the magic in his eyes, Checking every girl
in sight, grooving like he does the mambo."</LD>
<LD>   The song: "The Ketchup Song (Hey Hah)," a Spanish ditty about a
fashion-conscious gypsy named Diego who makes up his own brand of
rap. Lyrics are a Spanglish version of the Sugar Hill Gang's 1979
classic "Rapper's Delight."</LD>
<LD>   Where it's charting: Hailed as the successor to the Macarena, the
tune, with accompanying dance moves, is No. 1 in 15 countries across
Europe -- not to mention Australia.</LD>
<TE>   The artists: Sisters Lola, Pilar and Lucia Munoz, who formed Las
Ketchup a year ago. The name honors their dad, flamenco guitarist El
Tomate.</TE>
<TE>   The back story: The song got nonstop play in Spain this summer,
and tourists wanted to hear the catchy cut when they got home.
Pushing Eminem off the top of the European singles chart, the tune
has sold 2.6 million copies worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Cutting the mustard in the U.S.: The sisters Munoz just visited
Miami and New York to promote the album ("Hijas del Tomate" or
"Daughters of Tomate"). During its fourth week of release, ending
Oct. 13, they topped Billboard's "Heatseekers" new artists' chart.
The single from Columbia Records (not yet on sale in this country) is
No. 48 in terms of airplay and, locally, is among the top 10 most
requested cuts on KIIS-FM (102.7). The Ketchup video debuts Friday on
MTV.</TE>

<DH>In Soviet Russia, 'Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk' nearly undid
Shostakovich's career. As his political stock rose and fell, the
opera languished -- to his despair, son Maxim recalls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stalin was no music critic, but he knew what he didn't like.</LD>
<LD>   It was 1936 and the Soviet dictator happened to see a Moscow
production of Dmitri Shostakovich's opera "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk."
The gritty story of a woman trapped in a loveless marriage who
murders her father-in-law and husband to pursue a love affair with
one of their workers, "Lady Macbeth" had first been performed two
years earlier, in Leningrad and Moscow, where critics and crowds
alike had made it a hit. But days after Stalin's trip to the opera,
Pravda ran an unsigned editorial:</LD>
<LD>   "From the first minute of the opera, the listener is dumbfounded
by a deliberately dissonant, confused flow of sounds.... All of it is
crude, primitive, vulgar.... The music quacks, moans, pants and
chokes in order to render the love scenes as naturally as possible."
It has long been assumed that Stalin himself wrote the editorial; he
is surely responsible for what happened next.</LD>
<TE>   "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk" was banned in the Soviet Union for 30
years, and it was very seldom performed outside the country because
of strict controls on the orchestral score. One of only two operas by
Shostakovich, it became something of a legend: the mysterious unknown
work.</TE>
<TE>   It was also a personal turning point for the composer, who up
until then had been the golden boy of Soviet music. The "Lady
Macbeth" controversies kicked off decades of dangerous political ups
and downs for Shostakovich. When he was perceived as living up to the
ideals of Socialist Realism, he was awarded the Order of Lenin
(twice) and the Stalin Prize (twice), named secretary of the USSR.
Composers Union for eight years and, in 1966, became the first
composer to receive the title Hero of Socialist Labor.</TE>
<TE>   When he fell short, he was attacked. The Pravda "Lady Macbeth"
editorial was followed quickly by another one objecting to a
Shostakovich ballet score. At that point, the composer expected to be
arrested at any moment.</TE>
<TE>   His response was the controversial Fifth Symphony, with which he
expressly apologized for his supposed crimes. But in 1948, he was
attacked again, denounced for "formalistic perversions and
anti-democratic tendencies" in his music.</TE>
<TE>   Even after Stalin's death in 1953, when he felt freer to write
more directly, he encountered opposition. In an atmosphere of intense
anti-Semitism, government officials wanted to prevent the premiere of
his 13th Symphony (1962), which decried the Ukrainian and Nazi
massacre of Jews at Babi Yar in Kiev. Shostakovich continued to
create music through periods of repression and liberalization; he
died at age 68 in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Conductor Maxim Shostakovich, the composer's son, who was himself
denounced after his defection to the West in 1981, remembers
something of the roller coaster ride. "It was tragic," he said from
his son's home in Paris, a few days before he was scheduled to fly to
Los Angeles to conduct part of the run of "Lady Macbeth" in the
current Kirov-Los Angeles Opera production of the work. "My father
suffered. Everyone in the family was unhappy. It was a hard time;
1948 was a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Maxim wasn't born until 1938, two years after the Pravda
denunciations, but, he says, as he was growing up, the saga of "Lady
Macbeth" wasn't hidden or forgotten. "Always, when father talked
about something, he liked to use some phrase from the opera's
libretto," Maxim said. "So everybody in our family knows this opera.
He wasn't worried about talking about it because he was talking
within the family."</TE>
<TE>   More important, Maxim said, it was clear that the opera was his
father's "most beloved music child. He suffered a lot because of the
prohibition of this work."</TE>
<TE>   Once the assistant conductor of the Moscow Symphony and later
chief conductor of the Hong Kong and New Orleans symphonies, Maxim,
64, is now a freelancer, based in St. Petersburg since the demise of
the former Soviet Union. On Monday and Tuesday, he takes over the
podium in Los Angeles from the Kirov's music director, Valery
Gergiev. He has conducted this opera for the Kirov in the past, at
the company's home Maryinski Theatre in St. Petersburg and on tour in
Rotterdam in the Netherlands."Always, when I conduct father's music,
I feel he's very close to me," Maxim said. "I can hear his voice and
personality in his music. All his feelings." The current Kirov
production, he added, is one his father would have approved of; it
hasn't been reset in time or place. "He didn't like when some stage
director changed anything. He wanted the staging to be the time of
the opera."</TE>
<TE>   The Soviet ban against the opera faded in 1963, 10 years after
Stalin's death. At that time, the version authorities allowed on
stage was renamed -- "Katerina Ismailova" -- reorchestrated, and some
of the edgier aspects of the drama, especially a sex scene, were
smoothed over. Even that wasn't enough to get it back on stage the
first time Shostakovich tried.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of granting permission to do this opera surfaced," Maxim
said. "A committee from the Ministry of Culture came to our house.
Father played the score. I turned pages. It was in the early '60s.
They said, 'It's not the time for this opera yet.'</TE>
<TE>   "My father was very upset. It was like torture because he played a
lot of the score for them. They knew that he had waited for a time
when he thought the opera could appear again. But they knew it in
advance that they wouldn't permit it."</TE>
<TE>   Controversial overseas</TE>
<TE>   In the guise of "Katerina Ismailova," "Lady Macbeth" also made the
international rounds, appearing in 1963 at London's Covent Garden and
a year later in San Francisco. It was controversial, with many
critics regarding it as politically suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "Most musicologists consider the first version the stronger one,"
said Edgar Baitzel, L.A. Opera's director of operations. "The later
version is considered an artistic compromise the composer had to do
to see the work performed again. Valery Gergiev, however, thinks both
versions are fascinating and has done both back to back at the Kirov.
We left the artistic decision to him. He decided to bring the early
version, which is fine with us."</TE>
<TE>   Maxim doesn't see the revision as a compromise. "I don't think the
revision is tainted at all," he said. "I like very much both
versions. I conduct both of them.</TE>
<TE>   "Father preferred 'Katerina,' " he said. "He changed his opinions
about some of the words, orchestration and entr'actes. Father
remembered when people in the audience heard dirty words, they
laughed. So he made the language more pure. ['Katerina'] is
absolutely the same [as 'Lady Macbeth'] except for a little change in
the words and orchestration. The orchestra was too loud at times. He
was later more experienced in orchestrating, and he decided to change
that himself."</TE>
<TE>   As for why "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk" was plunged into obscurity in
the first place, Maxim has a theory. It was not so much the
adventuresome musical idiom or the work's vulgarity mentioned in the
original editorial, he said. Nor was it, as others have suggested,
that Stalin saw himself satirized in the character of a busy but
ineffective police sergeant.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there were two causes," Maxim said. "First, there are the
scenes when the peasants and workers say to Zinovy [Katerina's
husband], 'Oh, how we like you. Oh, when will you come back? Without
you, life is so poor.' Immediately in the next scene, they are alone
and they say, 'How we hate him.' Stalin thinks, 'Ah, it's the same.
In my presence, they say they love me. Inside of their souls, they
hate me.'</TE>
<TE>   "Also, the idea of someone poisoning him scared him. Katrina kills
her father-in-law by feeding him poisoned mushrooms. Stalin was very
upset that somebody would poison him. He thought that after this
opera, someone would get this idea to do it."</TE>

<HD>Ry Cooder can't escape Cuba's pull</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After career phases as ace sideman, respected blues/folk-rooted solo
artist, world music pioneer and film composer, Ry Cooder in recent
years gained considerable profile as a key instigator and producer of
the Cuban musical renaissance centered on the Buena Vista Social Club
projects.</LD>
<LD>   Now he's stepping out for the first star billing of his own since
his 1993 Grammy-winning "Meeting by the River" collaboration with
Indian musician V.M. Bhatt. And for the project he's turned ... back
to Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   Cooder has teamed with guitarist Manuel Galban, a key player in
the Buena Vista circle who worked with the vocal group Los Zafiros
starting in the '50s, for "Mambo Sinuendo," an album due from
Nonesuch Records early next year. But it's a project that stands
apart from the Buena Vista work.</LD>
<TE>   "The style of Los Zafiros was a strange offshoot from Cuban music
that I thought I could build on," Cooder says. "I wanted to do
something nontraditional, not in the path. We did all that. You have
to run to push the envelope, and Galban is an envelope pusher anyway.
He doesn't play like anyone down there. He's more like our electric
twangers."</TE>
<TE>   Assembling a muscular sexteto with himself and Galban on guitars,
American drummers Jim Keltner and Joachim Cooder (Ry's son) and Cuban
conga player Miguel Diaz and bassist Cachaito Lopez, Cooder sought a
musical territory between Perez Prado and Henry Mancini. The music
went in several other directions as well, with organ, electronic
percussion and three young Cuban Bata drummers thrown into the mix.</TE>
<TE>   With the success of the Cuban recordings, this would have seemed
an opportunity for Cooder to do an album completely his own,
something he hasn't done since 1987. The thought never occurred to
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what [a Cooder solo record] would be," he says. "I
can't imagine one at this point. I enjoy playing with other people.
I'm not a guy who writes albums of songs. My mind doesn't go there. I
look for these stories and settings to work with."</TE>
<TE>   Back in time, to Chavez Ravine</TE>
<TE>   Ry Cooder is at work on still another collaboration, this one as
part of a documentary film project built around photographer Don
Normark's study of L.A.'s Chavez Ravine in the years before the
largely Mexican American community there was displaced by Dodger
Stadium. Normark discovered the area when he was 18 in 1949 and wound
up spending a year doing a photo essay for a school project.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty years later he published "Chavez Ravine 1949: A Los Angeles
Story," collecting his haunting shots of a world that looked more
like a Mexican village than a part of urban L.A. Cooder recruited
veteran musician Lalo Guerrero to collaborate on songs evoking that
world and the cultural changes that were brewing around it.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I come upon something where the environmental
background or context is rich, then I seem motivated," Cooder says.</TE>
<TE>   Blockbuster team for a small film</TE>
<TE>   When you think of film music involving David Foster and his wife,
songwriter Linda Thompson, you generally think of blockbusters.
Foster produced much of Whitney Houston's material for the
record-setting soundtrack to "The Bodyguard," arranged Celine Dion's
performance of "When I Fall in Love" for "Sleepless in Seattle" and
produced Dion's huge hit "Because You Loved Me" from "Up Close and
Personal."</TE>
<TE>   So how did "The Rising Place," a tiny-budget film by independent
writer-director Tom Rice, get "God Bless the Heartache," written for
the project by Foster and Thompson with relatively unknown composer
Conrad Pope?</TE>
<TE>   The teaming came after a tape of the film, set in the South during
World War II, was given to Thompson by a mutual friend of her and
Rice.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a story that touched my heart," she says. "And Tom is the
kind of guy you can't not listen to."</TE>
<TE>   Inspired, Thompson wrote a set of lyrics and Foster, working with
a piece of instrumental score melody by Pope, composed the music.
Country-pop performer Kendall Payne did the vocals.</TE>
<TE>   They're takin' it to the streets</TE>
<TE>   Pink and Sheryl Crow are expected to perform free outdoor concerts
in the L.A. area this week, Pink on Thursday evening for a Halloween
celebration at a West Hollywood location still being confirmed and
Crow next Sunday at noon at a location to be announced.</TE>
<TE>   They are the final shows of a series presented in various U.S.
cities by Nissan to promote the company's new Z model. Stone Temple
Pilots, No Doubt, Puddle of Mudd and the White Stripes are among the
acts that have done previous shows. The White Stripes show in New
York's Union Square drew 7,000 people despite low-key promotion --
usually just handbills disseminated a few days before the concert,
with no radio or television advertising or tie-ins.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to keep to the brand, which is 'authentic,' " says
Chris Murphy, vice president of client services for George P.
Johnson, the Torrance-based event marketing firm that put the series
together for the automaker. "These concerts are falling in line with
that, having bands just show up and play."</TE>
<TE>   Small faces</TE>
<TE>   "Lady Jane Madonna"? "Mother Nature's Little Helper"? Songs by the
Beatles and the Rolling Stones won't be gene-spliced, but they will
be paired toe to toe in a special battle-of-the-bands edition of
"Breakfast With the Beatles," next Sunday starting at 9 a.m. on
KLSX-FM (97.1). In honor of the Stones' Southern California shows,
host Chris Carter will pit Beatles songs against Stones singles from
the same period, working his way from 1964 to 1970. It's the first
time an act other than the Fab Four (or its solo components) has been
featured on the show.</TE>
<TE>   Established among the top dance-music DJs, Paul Oakenfold will
embark on his first tour featuring live musicians in late November.
After his opening DJ sets each night, Oakenfold will switch to
keyboards and programming, accompanied by a bass player and drummer.
The vocals -- by Perry Farrell and several others featured on his
album "Bunkka" -- will be handled in specially produced video
"appearances" by the singers. An L.A. date is being scheduled for
mid-December.</TE>
<TE>   A soundtrack to "Amandla! A Revolution in Four Part Harmony," a
documentary about the role of music in the South African struggle
against apartheid, will be released in January by ATO Records,
co-owned by South Africa-born Dave Matthews. The music ranges from
traditional village songs to a jazz number by a young Miriam Makeba
to masses of citizens singing the anthem "Nkosi Sikeleli Africa" at a
rally after the 1994 election of Nelson Mandela as president. The
movie will be released in January by Artisan Entertainment and will
be shown on HBO in the spring.</TE>

<KH>BRIEF ENCOUNTER</KH>
<HD>Talk about range</HD>
<DH>Twelve-year-old Daveigh Chase goes from lovable 'Lilo' to
creepy 'Ring.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daveigh Chase, 12, supplied the voice to the irrepressible
Elvis-loving Lilo in the Disney animated hit "Lilo &amp; Stitch" -- she's
also reprising the voice for the upcoming TV series version -- as
well as to the heroine of the American version of the Japanese
animated film "Spirited Away." In her latest film, "The Ring," Chase
plays the ghost of a girl who holds the key to videotape that causes
people to die after they watch it. We chatted with Chase, who rides
horses in her spare time, at the DreamWorks Animation Studio in
Glendale.</LD>
<LD>   What is the biggest difference for you between doing voice acting
for animation and performing on screen?</LD>
<LD>   Chase:  In voice acting, you can't rely on your eyes or your body
movements to show what you are feeling. You have to put all of that
in your voice.</LD>
<TE>   But didn't the animators develop Lilo after watching you record
the voice?</TE>
<TE>   Chase: They will videotape it and then will put [my movements and
acting] into the character. I really get into it.</TE>
<TE>   For "Spirited Away," you were dubbing the character of Chihiro
into English. Was that difficult, since you had to record to
something already animated?</TE>
<TE>   Chase:  Well, it was kind of difficult at times because Chihiro's
mouth would only be open for a little bit, because you know how
sometimes Japanese phrases are short but they mean something really
long. That would be tough because I had to talk really fast and still
get all the emotional stuff into it or we would have to cut up the
line and edit it.</TE>
<TE>   Lilo isn't the typical Disney child heroine. Her character is
grumpy.</TE>
<TE>   Chase: I liked that about her. She's real.</TE>
<TE>   What about your character in "Spirited Away"?</TE>
<TE>   Chase: She's pretty real too. In the beginning she is a little
selfish. She doesn't want to move, and then she gets lost in the
spirit world and her parents turn into pigs and she has to save them,
and along the way she learns more about herself.</TE>
<TE>   Was it fun to play someone so evil in "The Ring"?</TE>
<TE>   Chase: It was really fun. It is not your typical character.
Usually they are looking for a happy-go-lucky kid, but Samara was a
pretty interesting character to play. I just kind of took my own
voice and put this freaky twist on it. The producer for this movie
told me she was a lot like Linda Blair in "The Exorcist." I saw part
of that, and what really freaked me out was when she was crawling up
upside down and backwards down the stairs -- kind of like the spider.</TE>
<TE>   The audience was screaming at your final scene in "The Ring." Did
it scare you?</TE>
<TE>   Chase: The ending actually totally freaked me out. I covered my
eyes and my mom looked over at me and saw me cover my eyes and she
was like, "Daveigh, that's you. Why are you scared of yourself?" It
really freaked me out because [the character] is all creepy.</TE>

<LD>Sigur Ros,</LD>
<LD>   in a language</LD>
<LD>   all its own</LD>
<TE>   Sigur Ros</TE>
<TE>   Untitled</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2, MCA</TE>
<TE>   Who knows what Sigur Ros singer Jon Thor Birgisson is actually
singing at any given time -- at least anyone outside Hopeland, the
imaginary realm whose imaginary language he uses? But throughout this
album's closing, 12-minute piece (the songs, as well as the album,
are without titles), he sings a two-syllable phrase that sounds more
or less like "you sigh."</TE>
<TE>   And you probably will sigh listening to this recording --
rapturously if you found the soundscapes of the Icelandic group's
"Agaetis Byrjun" wonderfully entrancing, perhaps just sleepily if you
found its pace tedious. The musical evolution of Sigur Ros seems to
move at a fittingly glacial pace, and new developments on this album
are subtle, though not insignificant.</TE>
<TE>   The overall effect is the same, the feeling of being enveloped by
waves at once icily numbing and warmly comforting, with Birgisson's
high voice and atmospheric bowed guitar the central features. But
there's added structure now, as the pieces (eight of them averaging
nearly nine minutes in length) rise from Brian Eno-like ambience to
drum-burst flurries recalling Icelandic composer Jon Leifs'
impressionistic portrayals of the island's vulcanian tempests. In
fact, the crescendo of Track 7 might actually make you gasp as well
as sigh. Sigur Ros plays the Wiltern Theatre Nov. 19 and 20.</TE>
<TE>   A more generous,</TE>
<TE>   loving namesake</TE>
<TE>   Tori Amos</TE>
<TE>   "Scarlet's Walk"</TE>
<TE>   ***, Epic</TE>
<TE>   Surviving trauma has always been a theme for this
singer-songwriter, and her seventh album is no exception. But as the
collection's title figure encounters myriad characters while making
her metaphorical way across the USA, Amos focuses less on registering
anger and hurt and more on seeking solace and love.</TE>
<TE>   That Scarlet ultimately finds both within herself is also a
typical Amos lesson, but, literary devices aside, "Scarlet's Walk"
reveals the eccentric musician's heart as more generous and unguarded
than ever. Although she was inspired by the feeling that Americans
saw their country after Sept. 11 as a wounded being rather than an
abstract concept, she forgoes collective soul-searching for a
characteristically intimate, personal take.</TE>
<TE>   Most strikingly, she eschews histrionics to sing with empathy and
soothing grace. The only slightly discordant notes are on the
false-Messiah reproach "Pancake." As the producer, Amos lets the
piano-driven tunes flow serenely into one another, with delicate
threads of electric guitar, strings and carefully placed percussion.
The songs interweave touchstones from her mother's Native American
heritage with scenes from across the country and myriad pop-culture
references. It's a lot to absorb, but Amos' gentle wit and sense of
constant reevaluation make "Scarlet's Walk" a curiously moving
journey toward inner strength. Amos headlines the Universal
Amphitheatre on Dec. 17.</TE>
<TE>   More sex talk</TE>
<TE>   and no apologies</TE>
<TE>   Shaggy</TE>
<TE>   "Lucky Day"</TE>
<TE>   ***, MCA</TE>
<TE>   Shaggy makes no particular claims of seriousness. Or not many.
Marley is rarely on the mind of this modern reggae singer, whose
specialty remains the sort of sticky rhymes on sex and manhood that
helped propel 2000's "Hotshot" album to sales of more than 6 million
in the U.S. So his new album  is more playful than deep, fueled by
mischievous charm and sultry visions.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a real man to make a woman complete," he sings early on,
demonstrating as much amid the female moans of ecstasy and electronic
riffs of "Hookie Jookie." Soon enough Chaka Khan herself is joining
Shaggy on the devious hip-hop soul of "Get My Party On."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the sex talk, Shaggy still finds a few moments of
spiritual uplift on "Full Control," a duet with reggae vet Barrington
Levy, declaring, "Independent woman doesn't depend on a soul nobody
has to tell her her role." There are more good vibes and a hint of
old-time R&amp;B on "Strength of a Woman." Less convincing is the ghetto
cautionary tale of "Lost." He sounds far more comfortable singing
from the bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Soul of Mexico's working class</TE>
<TE>   Los Tigres del Norte</TE>
<TE>   "La Reina del Sur"</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2, Fonovisa</TE>
<TE>   With a career that spans three decades, Los Tigres are among the
most respected groups in norteno, a genre often disparaged as hick
Mexican music.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Tigres release  shows a perk of their  success: The
group gets its pick of the best songs in the field. This superb set
of 14 tunes by eight composers stays so true to the reality of
working-class Mexicans it plays like a documentary.</TE>
<TE>   Several tunes include dialogue, with those earthy accents
characteristic of northern Mexico. We hear a distressed father
confronting a young man over his missing daughter, and another
heartbroken father sending off to war the son he raised to respect
life.</TE>
<TE>   The album also sparkles with the wit that characterizes so much
Mexican folk music. Los Tigres spoof the respectable and skewer the
powerful, knowing their fans will revel in satiric comic relief from
their daily grind. The group also revisits the narcocorrido, a style
it popularized in the '70s but had recently abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Musically, they avoid the genre's deadly redundancy by mixing
tempos, injecting unpredictable bass lines and using the accordion as
instrumental commentary to enhance the melodrama or sarcasm.</TE>

<TE>   The Backstreet Boy moves to Main Street with a solo debut full of
bad-boy bravado, beneath which beats the heart of -- three guesses --
a teddy bear. Carter  sounds super-glued to his dreamboat persona --
he emphasizes the rock and pop facets over the hip-hop elements, but
philosophically he's still the guy who wants to be there for the
right girl no matter what. These songs, mostly from
Backstreet-Britney writer-producer Max Martin, offer little to offset

<TE>   *** 1/2, Ruthless/Epic</TE>
<TE>   The Grammy-winning Cleveland quartet includes spiritual messages
and gruff gangster warnings in its elegant music. On its fourth
full-length album, Krayzie, Layzie, Wish and Bizzy deliver a powerful

<TE>   ****, WEA Latina</TE>
<TE>   On paper, the fusion of traditional flamenco with Cuban son sounds
gimmicky, but on his first foray (already in stores) into the

hand-clapping with electric guitars and montuno piano lines makes for
one of the most joyful records of the year.</TE>

<LD>Christina Aguilera</LD>
<LD>   "Stripped"</LD>
<LD>   ** 1/2, RCA</LD>
<TE>   Aguilera always had a head start on being grown up. Of the
late-'90s teen-pop crop, she was the most adult in style and
approach, so it's no surprise that on her first official adult pop
album she sounds, well, adult -- a husky, dusky, wailing, growling,
full-blown diva.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it a surprise that for the occasion Aguilera wants to show
us the real Christina. The problem is, "Stripped" ends up showing us
all the people that Aguilera wants to be. That would include Mary J.,
Alicia, Janet, Shakira, Pink.... The real Christina? She'll be along
when the singer adds artistic maturity and individuality to her
formidable technique.</TE>
<TE>   Aguilera labors hard to turn out aggressive, generic samples of
contemporary R&amp;B, rock and pop, but it's not until a stretch of three
songs written and produced by Linda Perry -- a veteran rock musician
who has found a new career rehabilitating ridiculed pop singers --
that "Stripped" springs to life.</TE>
<TE>   The power ballad "Beautiful," the eccentric pop track "Make Over"
and another ballad, "Cruz," (the last two co-written by Aguilera)
release a playfulness and personality that are untapped in most of
the album, where her technique acts as a straitjacket rather than a
door to artistic discovery.</TE>
<TE>   --Richard Cromelin</TE>
<TE>   Sigur Ros, in a language all its own</TE>
<TE>   Sigur Ros</TE>
<TE>   Untitled</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2, MCA</TE>
<TE>   Who knows what Sigur Ros singer Jon Thor Birgisson is actually
singing at any given time -- at least anyone outside Hopeland, the
imaginary realm whose imaginary language he uses? But throughout this
album's closing, 12-minute piece (the songs, as well as the album,
are without titles), he sings a two-syllable phrase that sounds more
or less like "you sigh."</TE>
<TE>   And you probably will sigh listening to this recording --
rapturously if you found the soundscapes of the Icelandic group's
"Agaetis Byrjun" wonderfully entrancing, perhaps just sleepily if you
found its pace tedious. The musical evolution of Sigur Ros seems to
move at a fittingly glacial pace, and new developments on this album
are subtle, though not insignificant.</TE>
<TE>   The overall effect is the same, the feeling of being enveloped by
waves at once icily numbing and warmly comforting, with Birgisson's
high voice and atmospheric bowed guitar the central features. But
there's added structure now, as the pieces (eight of them averaging
nearly nine minutes in length) rise from Brian Eno-like ambience to
drum-burst flurries recalling Icelandic composer Jon Leifs'
impressionistic portrayals of the island's vulcanian tempests. In
fact, the crescendo of Track 7 might actually make you gasp as well
as sigh. Sigur Ros plays the Wiltern Theatre Nov. 19 and 20.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   A more generous, loving namesake</TE>
<TE>   Tori Amos</TE>
<TE>   "Scarlet's Walk"</TE>
<TE>   ***, Epic</TE>
<TE>   Surviving trauma has always been a theme for this
singer-songwriter, and her seventh album is no exception. But as the
collection's title figure encounters myriad characters while making
her metaphorical way across the USA, Amos focuses less on registering
anger and hurt and more on seeking solace and love.</TE>
<TE>   That Scarlet ultimately finds both within herself is also a
typical Amos lesson, but, literary devices aside, "Scarlet's Walk"
reveals the eccentric musician's heart as more generous and unguarded
than ever. Although she was inspired by the feeling that Americans
saw their country after Sept. 11 as a wounded being rather than an
abstract concept, she forgoes collective soul-searching for a
characteristically intimate, personal take.</TE>
<TE>   Most strikingly, she eschews histrionics to sing with empathy and
soothing grace. The only slightly discordant notes are on the
false-Messiah reproach "Pancake." As the producer, Amos lets the
piano-driven tunes flow serenely into one another, with delicate
threads of electric guitar, strings and carefully placed percussion.
The songs interweave touchstones from her mother's Native American
heritage with scenes from across the country and myriad pop-culture
references. It's a lot to absorb, but Amos' gentle wit and sense of
constant reevaluation make "Scarlet's Walk" a curiously moving
journey toward inner strength. Amos headlines the Universal
Amphitheatre on Dec. 17.</TE>
<TE>   --Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   More sex talk and no apologies</TE>
<TE>   Shaggy</TE>
<TE>   "Lucky Day"</TE>
<TE>   ***, MCA</TE>
<TE>   Shaggy makes no particular claims of seriousness. Or not many.
Marley is rarely on the mind of this modern reggae singer, whose
specialty remains the sort of sticky rhymes on sex and manhood that
helped propel 2000's "Hotshot" album to sales of more than 6 million
in the U.S. So his new album is more playful than deep, fueled by
mischievous charm and sultry visions.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a real man to make a woman complete," he sings early on,
demonstrating as much amid the female moans of ecstasy and electronic
riffs of "Hookie Jookie." Soon enough Chaka Khan herself is joining
Shaggy on the devious hip-hop soul of "Get My Party On."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the sex talk, Shaggy still finds a few moments of
spiritual uplift on "Full Control," a duet with reggae vet Barrington
Levy, declaring, "Independent woman doesn't depend on a soul nobody
has to tell her her role." There are more good vibes and a hint of
old-time R&amp;B on "Strength of a Woman." Less convincing is the ghetto
cautionary tale of "Lost." He sounds far more comfortable singing
from the bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Appleford</TE>
<TE>   Soul of Mexico's working class</TE>
<TE>   Los Tigres del Norte</TE>
<TE>   "La Reina del Sur"</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2, Fonovisa</TE>
<TE>   With a career that spans three decades, Los Tigres are among the
most respected groups in norteno, a genre often disparaged as hick
Mexican music.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Tigres release shows a perk of their success: The group
gets its pick of the best songs in the field. This superb set of 14
tunes by eight composers stays so true to the reality of
working-class Mexicans it plays like a documentary.</TE>
<TE>   Several tunes include dialogue, with those earthy accents
characteristic of northern Mexico. We hear a distressed father
confronting a young man over his missing daughter, and another
heartbroken father sending off to war the son he raised to respect
life.</TE>
<TE>   The album also sparkles with the wit that characterizes so much
Mexican folk music. Los Tigres spoof the respectable and skewer the
powerful, knowing their fans will revel in satiric comic relief from
their daily grind. The group also revisits the narcocorrido, a style
it popularized in the '70s but had recently abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Musically, they avoid the genre's deadly redundancy by mixing
tempos, injecting unpredictable bass lines and using the accordion as
instrumental commentary to enhance the melodrama or sarcasm.</TE>
<TE>   --Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   In brief</TE>
<TE>   Nick Carter</TE>
<TE>   "Now or Never"</TE>
<TE>   * 1/2, Jive</TE>
<TE>   The Backstreet Boy moves to Main Street with a solo debut full of
bad-boy bravado, beneath which beats the heart of -- three guesses --
a teddy bear. Carter sounds super-glued to his dreamboat persona --
he emphasizes the rock and pop facets over the hip-hop elements, but
philosophically he's still the guy who wants to be there for the
right girl no matter what. These songs, mostly from
Backstreet-Britney writer-producer Max Martin, offer little to offset
Carter's reed-thin vocals.</TE>

<KH>MEDIA MATTERS / DAVID SHAW</KH>
<HD>On your day's to-do list, is reading the paper a must?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Shaw</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you think about the 10 or 15 things you absolutely have to do
today, and the various decisions you have to make about them, how
helpful would you say your daily newspaper is likely to be in any of
those endeavors? My guess is you'd say, "Not very" -- no matter what
paper you read.</LD>
<LD>   "We have become disturbingly disconnected from average Americans,"
says Martin Baron, editor of the Boston Globe, "from their most basic
concerns about getting by day to day, paying the bills, educating the
kids, holding together marriages, making it through work."</LD>
<LD>   In large part, that's because journalists define news as a
departure from the norm -- something new, different, sensational,
spectacular, terrible, tragic, triumphant, scandalous -- and they
haven't figured out how to stretch that definition to include the
everyday. But the norm (driving through traffic, interacting with
office colleagues, disciplining children) defines many people's daily
lives.</LD>
<TE>   That doesn't mean newspapers should ape the news-you-can-use
approach of local television news. Most people buy a daily newspaper
because they're interested in what's happening in the world at large
-- especially when, as now, much of what's happening is confusing,
even frightening. People want help making sense of the day's events.</TE>
<TE>   So how can newspapers be relevant on routine, personal issues --
while simultaneously trying to explain terrorism, global warming and
a faltering economy? There is room in a good newspaper for both
functions, and the best way to balance them is to connect them.</TE>
<TE>   Connecting the personal to the political and the global to the
local is a matter of survival for newspapers, which have been losing
circulation for more than 30 years. Knowing that they risk becoming
irrelevant to readers who are busier than ever, and who have ever
more alternative sources of information, many newspapers across the
country are trying desperately to make those connections.</TE>
<TE>   Workplace coverage</TE>
<TE>   Some newspapers used to have full-time "labor reporters" who
devoted much of their time to covering internal union politics. Now
several papers cover the less contentious but, to many, more relevant
issues of the workplace -- and in the process, connect the
impersonal, at times mind-numbing statistics of the business section
with the realities of everyday employment. The Boston Globe, for
example, has a weekly "BostonWorks" feature that provides coverage of
such workplace issues as health care, finding a new job, mid-career
education and techniques for creating a positive work environment.</TE>
<TE>   Other papers have tried to make a different connection -- between
reader and community -- by providing the kind of neighborhood news
and information once limited to small weekly newspapers. The Dallas
Morning News has created a series of 13 localized regional zone
sections that offer a list of new books in the public library; the
addresses and prices of recent home sales; meeting times and places
for social, civic and service clubs; and greens fees at local golf
courses.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Times, in redesigning all its feature sections,
tried -- among other objectives -- to make them more useful to
readers. It shifted many of its entertainment listings from Sunday
Calendar to the Calendar section published on Thursdays, for example,
figuring that would be advantageous to readers planning their weekend
activities (although many readers actually complained about the
change).</TE>
<TE>   A growing number of newspapers -- the Orange County Register,
Detroit Free Press, Seattle Times and San Francisco Chronicle among
them -- are publishing weekly guides to local road construction,
detours, blockages and mass transit issues.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 'Commuter Chronicles' every Monday, but we still don't do
enough with it," says Phil Bronstein, executive editor of the
Chronicle. "We need to have reporters actually travel the problem
routes and explain how you can avoid the traffic jams, provide
alternate routes. This is useful, practical information about
real-life, real-time experiences."</TE>
<TE>   But newspapers shouldn't sacrifice their uniqueness on the altar
of usefulness. They can't surrender their role as public watchdog nor
their functions of analysis and explanation to make room for
"relevant" stories of dubious value. Papers can misfire badly when
their quest for relevance leads them to superficial "how to" stories
or misguided attempts to connect with readers by giving
disproportionate attention to catchy subjects.</TE>
<TE>   One day recently, just when the congressional debate on Iraq was
ratcheting up, USA Today devoted its biggest Page 1 headline to a new
study on obesity in America -- and relegated Iraq to Page 10.</TE>
<TE>   Too often these days, some newspapers seem to be allowing their
advertising departments, rather than their editors, to decide what's
"relevant." New features are introduced with the announced intent of
"serving readers" and "connecting to readers" when their real purpose
often seems to be to lure lucrative advertising dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "Many papers that have tried to be relevant have mistakenly
interpreted 'relevance' as only what happens within a 20-square-mile
radius of the office or as something very practical and direct --
where to buy a pillow, how to lose 20 pounds in the next two weeks or
what to cook for dinner tonight," says Sandra Mims Rowe, the editor
of the Portland Oregonian.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are all relevant to people's lives, but relevance and what
is useful also has a much broader definition and involves more
complexity and depth and understanding," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Rowe and the Oregonian have been ambitious. Three years ago, the
paper won a Pulitzer Prize for reporter Richard Read's pursuit of a
single lot of potatoes from a processing plant in Oregon back to the
growers and then on to Singapore, where it went to a McDonald's. The
Pulitzer board praised Read for "vividly illustrating the domestic
impact of the Asian economic crisis," and Rowe says his account
"couldn't have been any more relevant, any more important, to our
readers."</TE>
<TE>   Other newspapers have to be similarly creative -- and similarly
ambitious -- in finding and reporting stories that show their readers
how, and why, important social, political and economic issues can
affect them and their families.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen months ago, most Americans probably didn't think a small
fundamentalist Islamic sect in the remote mountains of Afghanistan
was terribly relevant to their lives. Judging from the decline in
international reporting through the late 1980s and early 1990s, most
newspaper editors and television news directors didn't think so
either.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone learned differently on Sept. 11.</TE>

<LD>"When I was a kid, I fantasized about this theater -- dreamed I would
be discovered on this stage," Academy Award-winning actress Diane
Keaton told the 400 guests at Pasadena Playhouse's 5th annual Theatre
de la Gala. "It is a national treasure." Sharing the spotlight with
Lyla White, Playhouse executive director, Keaton welcomed theater
buffs to the Oct. 19 soiree structured like a three-act play.</LD>
<LD>   First up: a buffet out on El Molino Avenue, in front of the
78-year-old landmark, with fine wines and fare ranging from sand dabs
tempura-style to brie en croute. Next: an onstage tribute to David
Davis, outgoing Playhouse board chairman, which included Tournament
of Roses Queen Carolina Hsu presenting him with a floral spray.
Finally, after intermission, during which guests again took to the
street for java and desserts: Emmy Award-winning screenwriter Peter
Tolan's original production of "Musical Madness," a hilarious sendup
inspired by great books, such as "The Iliad" (a la Kander &amp; Ebb) and
"Metamorphosis" (a la Irving Berlin). "Tonight, Broadway came to
Pasadena," White said.</LD>

<LD>A demure Christina Ricci stood apart from the crowd at Chanel's
Beverly Hills boutique, comparing the scene with a similar gathering
in New York. "It's very different here," she said. "It is less
business-oriented. It's not as serious."</LD>
<LD>   The Oct. 17 cocktail party, hosted by Ricci and Chloe Sevigny,
launched Chanel's new fragrance, Chance. In return for their
appearances, Chanel donated $5,000 each to the actresses' favorite
charities.</LD>
<LD>   The party was in full swing when two men in black leather jackets
adorned with safety pins were stopped by a publicist. "Are you guys
guests?" she asked. "No," said the one wearing dark sunglasses,
"we're with Chloe." (They were Brain McPeck and Matt McAuley of the
New York band A.R.E. Weapons.)</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the actress, looking prim in a purple pantsuit, swanned
past the photographers, pausing before each. "They've never been to
L.A. before," she said of her friends. "I thought it would be fun ...
to discover it with them." She glanced toward the men, who stood
motionless. "They're having a blast," Sevigny said. "They'd have a
blast anywhere."</TE>

<HD>TV shows, old and new, find new life on DVD</HD>
<DH>Classic series -- and some not so classic -- as well as
shows still on the air look better than new in the digital format.
'Law &amp; Order' is next.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It hasn't taken long for home entertainment honchos to realize that
DVD aficionados crave digital editions of their favorite movies and
television series. Thanks to the DVD success of such popular
television series as "The Simpsons," "The Sopranos," "Star Trek" and
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer," major studios seem bent on releasing
shows currently on the air and vintage classics. Recent releases
include "24" and classics such as "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "I
Love Lucy."</LD>
<LD>   The great thing about watching old series on DVD is that the
quality is superior to the often faded, worn prints used on
television. The studios have mined their vaults to find extra goodies
for many of the releases, and even restored cuts that had been made
when the series were sold into syndication.</LD>
<LD>   Universal is the latest to get into the lucrative television DVD
market. The studio has tapped the gold mine known as "Law &amp; Order."
Not only is the NBC crime series still going strong in its 13th
season on the peacock network, the Dick Wolf-created show also can be
seen in repeats on A&amp;E and TNT. Universal recently debuted "Law &amp;
Order -- The First Year" ($80). Besides every episode from the
freshman year of the Emmy Award-winning series, the set includes
informative interviews with Wolf as well as then co-executive
producer Joseph Stern.</LD>
<TE>   Back then, the cast included George Dzundza (now seen on CBS'
"Hack"), Chris Noth ("Sex and the City's" Big), Michael Moriarty,
Richard Brooks and Steven Hill. Guest stars the first season included
Cynthia Nixon from "Sex and the City" and William H. Macy.</TE>
<TE>   If "Law &amp; Order" helps fans celebrate an acclaimed series -- one
that many current fans didn't watch in its first few seasons -- there
are different motivations behind the DVD release of Universal's
"Baretta" ($40), which arrives in stores Tuesday. It seems like the
studio is cashing in on the notoriety of star Robert Blake, awaiting
trial in the killing of his wife, Bonny Lee Bakely. Blake received an
Emmy for his performance in 1975 as the quirky police detective who
uses disguises -- though he doesn't look very different from one
disguise to another -- to catch the bad guy.</TE>
<TE>   But the ABC series from Stephen J. Cannell is nowhere near the
quality of "Law &amp; Order." It's a bit disconcerting to hear Baretta
propose to his longtime girlfriend and tell her, albeit in a joking
fashion, that he'd kill her if she didn't accept. Universal is also
offering a single disc, "The Best of Baretta" ($20).</TE>
<TE>   For comedy fans, Fox will release Tuesday the entertaining
"Malcolm in the Middle Season One" DVD set ($40), which features the
first 13 episodes of the popular Emmy Award-winning Fox comedy about
a dysfunctional family. The digital set includes amusing audio
commentary from creator Linwood Boomer and director Todd Holland on
the expanded pilot episode, plus commentary from the cast and crew on
selected episodes, deleted scenes, an amusing gag reel, visual
bloopers and a cute profile of Erik Per Sullivan, who plays Dewey.</TE>
<TE>   Miniseries have also found a new life on DVD. Two of the best of
the recent crop of miniseries are the Royal Shakespeare Company's
groundbreaking nine-hour adaptation of Charles Dickens' "The Life and
Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby" (A&amp;E, $80) and the brilliant and
densely plotted "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" (Acorn, $70 each for
DVD and VHS), both of which aired on American television in the early
'80s.</TE>
<TE>   "Nicholas Nickleby" has been digitally remastered and features
filmographies, a printed biography of Dickens and the Dickens
installment of A&amp;E's "Biography."</TE>
<TE>   "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" is based on John Le Carre's
acclaimed spy novel and stars Alec Guinness as the bespectacled
master British spy George Smiley. The DVD features a new interview
with Le Carre, talent files and production notes. The quality of the
transfer, though, is uneven.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving Tuesday from MIP Home Video is the digital edition of the
first 14 hours of the 30-hour ABC miniseries "War and Remembrance,"
based on Herman Wouk's mammoth novel about World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Though the 1988-89 miniseries didn't score the ratings success
that its prequel, "The Winds of War," did on ABC in 1983, this epic
is far superior. The DVD includes a 1988 featurette, "War and
Remembrance -- A Living History," hosted with steely determination by
series star Robert Mitchum and a new retrospective, "The Making of
War and Remembrance," which features interviews with
producer-director Dan Curtis, Wouk and several cast members.</TE>

<HD>Back to the days of subversive innocence</HD>
<DH>'Far From Heaven' is pure homage to those '50s 'women's
pictures.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Thomson</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prepare yourself for an unashamed beauty such as modern movies seldom
yield to. Float on a swooning score by Elmer Bernstein, that
essential movie composer of the 1950s. Be ready for a wide-screen
composition of four women on a suburban lawn of Kelly green, and the
gorgeous clash of their billowing skirts, in rose pink, vermilion,
amber and scarlet. Or Scarlett?</LD>
<LD>   Yes, these are attributions of color that might serve as
emblematic names in melodrama. I'm talking about the new Todd Haynes
movie, "Far From Heaven," one of the headiest experiences of the fall
-- a picture that could as easily have been titled "All That Heaven
Allows," "Written on the Wind" or even "Gone With the Wind." For here
we are in Hartford, Conn., in 1957 (where you are entitled to read
"heartland" for Hartford, meaning not just the core of Eisenhower's
America, but a promise of heartfelt feeling). I don't think any major
American picture since "Pulp Fiction" has been so brazen, so radiant
even, about saying, "Here's a story (if you like), but more
important, here's a certain type of movie."</LD>
<TE>   There's the rub. "Pulp Fiction" is a commonly recognized genre, a
stew of noir, sex, violence and intrigue, done with flat-out speed
and hard-boiled idioms. Kids and their parents were hip to the riffs
Quentin Tarantino was playing off Bogart or Mitchum tunes. But surely
in 2002 there are going to be some people who wonder why they're
being asked to dwell on this sad story of people from 1957, antiques
of desire and repression who seem unable to solve their problems.
Fifty years of television and its 12-step dramas have instilled the
ridiculous American orthodoxy that we can all make ourselves whole
and wholesome. (It's only in life that people do 20 years with a
shrink, clinging onto their condition, while having affairs with
other patients encountered in the shrink's waiting room.)</TE>
<TE>   To be blunt, "Far From Heaven," which opens Nov. 8, has a
narrative pressure, a suggestive color scheme and a stress on camera
style that asks, "Why, why on Earth (or in heaven) doesn't Julianne
Moore take her scarlet dress and her tender black gardener (Dennis
Haysbert) off into the mauve rhododendrons and have the great bloom
of orgasm she yearns for?" Think of that composition!</TE>
<TE>   Not that "Far From Heaven" ever lapses into camp or coyness. These
days, it might be more audience-friendly if it teased the old genre.
To the contrary, Haynes has made an authentic homage, faithful and
fond. But that approach to the film can hardly be posted on screen as
an introduction, no matter that the following excellent film history
is the second paragraph in the press book prepared by Focus Features:
" 'Far From Heaven' tells the story of a privileged housewife in
1950s America, and is inspired by the great Hollywood 'women's' films
of that era."</TE>
<TE>   Haynes vividly evokes the intense colors and visual style of
filmmaker Douglas Sirk ("Imitation of Life," "Written on the Wind")
to depict the teeming, oppressive surfaces of middle-class,
mid-century America and the furtive, life-shattering desires that
fester beneath them.</TE>
<TE>   Renewed respect for genre</TE>
<TE>   The "women's picture," of course, is a description from before the
dawn of feminism. Yet it refers to an honorable genre in American
screen history, one that concentrates on the emotional plight or
solitude of ardent yet wronged women, and which seemingly is directed
at the women in the audience.</TE>
<TE>   That covers Lillian Gish in D.W. Griffith's "Way Down East" or
"Broken Blossoms"; Gish again in "The Wind," directed by Victor
Sjostrom; Janet Gaynor in several films by F.W. Murnau ("Sunrise") or
Frank Borzage ("Seventh Heaven"); to say nothing of such classic
"weepies" as Joan Crawford in "Mannequin" (also by Borzage); Barbara
Stanwyck in "Stella Dallas" (by King Vidor); Loretta Young in "Man's
Castle" (again Borzage); Irene Dunne or Margaret Sullavan in two
versions of "Back Street" (the one by John M. Stahl, the other by
Robert Stevenson); Olivia de Havilland in "To Each His Own" (by
Mitchell Leisen); and even Vivien Leigh in "Gone With the Wind."</TE>
<TE>   That last entry stretches the point, I concede, because Leigh's
Scarlett O'Hara is so feisty, so active and so selfish that she
shades into the kind of woman played by Bette Davis. Still, Scarlett
has stretches of self-pity and an ultimate inability to get and keep
her man. By contrast, it is Melanie (De Havilland) who stays loyal to
the sweet, passive hope that Gish embodied and which is still to be
found in Joan Fontaine in Max Ophuls' "Letter From an Unknown Woman,"
and which makes Crawford the emotional patsy for her grasping
daughter in "Mildred Pierce."</TE>
<TE>   Now, serious film criticism has seldom known where to place such
films, no matter that "Sunrise," "Letter From an Unknown Woman" and
"The Wind" are often put in the pantheon. Still there was the
assumption that women's pictures were "novelettish," "trashy" or
"overdone," all of which ignores the way "Mildred Pierce," say, is a
trenchant study of money, work and marriage, while just about any
great close-up of Garbo leads one to wonder if the cinema has a finer
message than the emotional wistfulness of mistreated women, or women
who have fallen into the gap between reality and hope.</TE>
<TE>   I trust that the titles mentioned already are enough to reawaken
respect for a genre, without need of "feminist" interpretation. But
the case of Douglas Sirk is subtler and more intriguing. And it is
Sirk whom Haynes has his eyes on. Detlef Sierck (1900-87) was
probably born in Denmark, reason enough to say that other
Scandinavian directors, including Carl Dreyer and Ingmar Bergman,
have excelled in this genre. Sirk went to Germany and became a
prolific director of theater who began making movies in the '30s. Two
of those films, "Zu Neuen Ufern" and "La Habanera," both starring
Zarah Leander, a dark-haired Garbo look-alike, are outstanding
melodramas.</TE>
<TE>   Critiques of complacency</TE>
<TE>   Sirk came to Hollywood in 1939 and stayed. But it was only in the
1950s, at Universal, that he discovered his own kind of women's
picture. Working for producers Ross Hunter and Albert Zugsmith, he
delivered pictures that nag at the false conventions in America of
the '50s, that make the most of unpromising actors and that develop a
critique of American complacency. These are also pictures in which
color, composition, decor and sweeping camera movements are
inseparable from the depth of feeling and the rising current of
social irony. But just listen to the titles, soaring and
interchangeable: "All I Desire," "Magnificent Obsession" (a remake),
"All That Heaven Allows," "Written on the Wind," "The Tarnished
Angels" (an adaptation of Faulkner's novel "Pylon") and "Imitation of
Life" (another remake).</TE>
<TE>   All those films played in the '50s and did pretty well at the box
office. It was an innocent moment perhaps, one that hardly knew that
Rock Hudson -- one of Sirk's frequent stars -- was gay, and was very
happy with him as a gentle, healing man for such lovelorn wrecks as
Jane Wyman offered in "Magnificent Obsession" and "All That Heaven
Allows." Like many American films of that era, they first won
critical acclaim in France. Francois Truffaut was a great admirer of
"Written on the Wind," and why not? It is, maybe, the most accessible
of Sirk's films in that it plays off the palatable notion that the
children of the rich (Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, as the scions
of big oil) are depraved or impotent, vicious and self-destructive,
while true feeling rests with simpler souls (Hudson and Lauren
Bacall).</TE>
<TE>   As I write that, I realize how tempting or natural it is, in 2002,
to spice the synopsis with sarcasm and camp glee. But on the screen,
in the '50s, Sirk presented his stories with an absorbed, mounting
hysteria in which a discerning eye could feel the metaphorical reach
of the crackup. That was true in other films made in the '50s, when a
few directors were trying to signal "Lies!" and "Fraud!" from within
the impacted prosperity and confidence of the age. There is
melodramatic critique akin to that of Sirk in Nicholas Ray's "Bigger
Than Life," in Robert Aldrich's "Autumn Leaves" and in Otto
Preminger's "Angel Face."</TE>
<TE>   But those films were acute and subversive just because they were
set in current times. They were real tests of an audience, urging it
to look beneath apparent content (the happy ending) to the disturbing
hysteria of style. "Far From Heaven" has re-created that style, and
Ed Lachman's camerawork (already rewarded at the Venice Film
Festival) is a fall riot of drenched colors. But retaining the '50s
setting, it seems to me, is a mistake, and one that may leave the
film too remote.</TE>
<TE>   The "happy" marriage built on lies is as current now as ever.
There are still perfect husbands (like Dennis Quaid here -- really
marvelous) screaming to get out of the closet, just as there are
immaculate wives who hardly realize how far they long for emotional
truth and an orgasm of their own. I don't know Hartford, but in the
private school world of Pacific Heights in San Francisco, there would
still be a frisson if one of our Julianne Moores (forget the A-line
dress -- she'd wear gym gear now) collected her 5-year-old with a
black man in tow, and one a little sexier than Mr. Haysbert. In other
words, the path of social commentary by means of the women's picture
is still begging to be taken.</TE>

<HD>Brazil's voice, and its soul</HD>
<DH>After almost 40 albums, Caetano Veloso was ready to take a
break from writing Brazilian-themed songs. But the boredom with his
country as a theme didn't last for long.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hector Tobar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Rio de Janeiro</DL>
<LD>Caetano Veloso has been called "the Bob Dylan of Brazil," and on this
day there is something definitely Dylanesque about his appearance. He
enters the room with a messy mop of salt-and-pepper hair, dark
Moorish eyes and jeans that cling tenuously to his skinny frame.</LD>
<LD>   It's the end of a long working day. A Rio sunset shimmers through
the windows of his production office, tropical hills bathed in
tangerine light, the sky painted various hues of violet. The artist
looks a bit worn out. You could even say Caetano Veloso looks bored
-- though he would really prefer you didn't.</LD>
<LD>   The last time Veloso revealed as much to an interviewer, it set
off a nationwide controversy. "I am bored by Brazil," he said. In the
days that followed, newspaper columnists, politicians and critics all
weighed in on what he could have possibly meant.</LD>
<TE>   It was like hearing Bruce Springsteen say, "I am bored by New
Jersey," or Woody Guthrie say, "I am bored by being American,"
because to millions of people here and elsewhere Veloso has helped
define what it means to be Brazilian.</TE>
<TE>   For more than three decades, Veloso has told the story of his
country in songs, in marchinhas (little marches) about the Flamengo
beach in Rio, in gentle ballads about the "concrete poets" of Sao
Paulo, and sambas about the celebrations in Salvador on Emancipation
Day -- almost 40 albums in all, and hundreds of songs.</TE>
<TE>   "What I meant was that I was bored of Brazil as a theme, that I
just didn't want to do things where I always had to pick up the story
of Brazil," he says by way of explanation. And, anyways, it was only
a momentary hesitation. The music he brings to UCLA's Royce Hall on
Tuesday and Wednesday -- is inspired, precisely, by Brazil and the
crime at the heart of its 500-year history.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for "Noites do Norte" (Northern Nights) came to Veloso
the same way his artistic inspirations usually hit him: A friend gave
him a book to read, an intellectual problem to ponder. He quickly
became unbored with Brazil as he devoured "Minha Formacao" (My
Formation), a memoir by 19th century abolitionist Joaquim Nabuco.</TE>
<TE>   "As I read it I started thinking again about the central, the key
aspect to grasp the phenomenon of Brazil, which is race," Veloso says
in fluent English. "I wanted other people to listen to what he had
written. Because in fact what we need to talk about in Brazil is a
second abolition [of slavery], and he was one of the first people to
see this."</TE>
<TE>   Spend time in the company of Caetano Veloso, the 60-year-old
thinker-troubadour of this country, and you realize that ideas are
what drive him. Talk to him about a book, about the thinking behind
an especially complex musical composition, and you will see that
famous, seductive gleam return to his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, before he became a pop star, he was a gaunt and
restless young man who studied philosophy at the Federal University
of Bahia. He dreamed of being a painter or a filmmaker.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Veloso has made a career of creating art from his
country's vast encyclopedia of sound and imagery. Using his
prodigious talents as a songwriter, he has transformed this cultural
raw material into a musical oeuvre all his own, music that questions,
and delights in, all the contradictions that come with being
Brazilian.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, he's stayed in the vanguard of Brazilian music for
three decades, winning a Grammy in 2000 for his critically acclaimed
album "Livro" and another the following year for co-producing an
album by his childhood musical hero, Joao Gilberto.</TE>
<TE>   And Veloso is wildly prolific. In the past three years, he has
released the soundtrack to "Orfeu" (an updated version of "Black
Orpheus"); a homage to Federico Fellini inspired by the music of Nino
Rota; the two-disc "Noites do Norte" recording; "Live in Bahia"
(another double-CD package); and his latest, a collaboration with
fellow artist-thinker Jorge Mautner.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way to talk about Brazilian music without thinking
about Caetano, without talking about Caetano's generation," says
Antonio Miguel, music critic at the Rio daily newspaper O Globo. In
the late 1960s, Veloso helped lead a movement that revitalized
Brazilian popular music by infusing it with a potpourri of British
pop, regional music from a variety of Latin American sub- cultures
and a big dose of hippie attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the decades he's kept on reinventing himself," Miguel
continues. "He's always incorporating new musical elements without
losing his essence, which is that of a young guy from the interior of
Bahia, and of a man with a great sense of culture, and a passion for
popular culture."</TE>
<TE>   A musical revolutionary</TE>
<TE>   Veloso catches sight of the book a reporter has brought to the
interview, a review copy of the English translation of his memoir,
"Tropical Truth." Thanks to the vagaries of the American publishing
business, The Times has received a copy before he has.</TE>
<TE>   He takes the book and examines the cover photograph. It shows a
line of young people in bohemian garb and holding various props,
including a feather duster and an umbrella, a sort of Brazilian
version of "Sgt. Pepper."</TE>
<TE>   "It was in 1969," he says. "About a week before we left Brazil to
live in London. You know, in exile."</TE>
<TE>   Veloso and several other people in the photograph helped launch a
pop music revolution in Brazil that was inspired, in part, by the
Beatles. Unlike the Fab Four, however, Veloso and his friends were
driven out of their country for doing so.</TE>
<TE>   The new brand of music -- created by Veloso with Gilberto Gil and
other collaborators -- came to be known as "tropicalia" and the ideas
behind it "tropicalismo." The birth of tropicalia is detailed at
length in "Tropical Truth" (released this month by Knopf), which
traces Veloso's musical formation from his childhood in Bahia to his
exile in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Veloso was a teenager about the same time Elvis films were
reaching the movie screen of his provincial hometown. He wasn't a
fan. In the context of 1950s Brazil, Veloso recalls, listening to
Elvis made you a conformist -- wannabe Americans listened to him. And
Veloso's sharp musical ear couldn't help but notice that the guitar
on "Love Me Tender" was badly out of tune.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, what really excited Veloso the teenager were the silky,
sophisticated melodies of a bossa nova, and its founder, Joao
Gilberto, who fused traditional Brazilian samba with jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Veloso would become a bossa nova singer. In his early 20s he won a
nationwide songwriting contest and moved to Sao Paulo to begin a
music career.</TE>
<TE>   Thrown into the vibrant cultural milieu of Sao Paulo -- arguably
the Southern Hemisphere's best imitation of New York City -- Veloso
watched the films of Jean-Luc Godard and went to exhibitions by
Brazil's growing circle of avant-garde painters. After watching one
especially raw and angry movie of the Brazilian Cinema Novo school,
he decided he needed to do something equally subversive in his own
art.</TE>
<TE>   So he sat down and started to write music that tossed aside bossa
nova's conventions. In its place came tropicalia, which embraced much
that "refined" Brazilian popular music hated.</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to work with what was considered rubbish," Caetano
says as he closes the book. "Argentine tangos, Cuban and Mexican
boleros, music that was considered kitsch, too sentimental. And a
Brazilian imitation of rock-ish international pop too. None of this
was respected by people who supposedly worked with good, high-quality
popular music."</TE>
<TE>   At the first public presentation of a tropicalia song -- at a Sao
Paulo music festival -- Veloso startled the audience by forgoing the
usual tuxedo for a checkered brown suit and bright orange turtleneck.
More shocking, he had an Argentine rock band behind him.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, Veloso's songs were seemingly playful and
innocuous -- they included references to things like Esso gas
stations and Brigitte Bardot. But under the surface, there was a
bitter rejection of the conformity engendered by Brazil's military
dictatorship.</TE>
<TE>   One morning before dawn, Veloso was arrested by the police at his
Sao Paulo apartment and spirited off to jail. The police turned him
over to the military. Veloso would spend two Kafkaesque months at a
variety of jails without anyone telling him why he was being held.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he was brought before an especially erudite army captain
who said he had been disturbed by an interview in which Veloso had
used the word "deconstruct" to describe his music.</TE>
<TE>   "He denounced the insidious subversive power of our work," Veloso
wrote in "Tropical Truth." "He said he clearly understood that what
Gil and I were doing was much more dangerous than the work of artists
who were engaged in explicit protest and political activity."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, Veloso was released from jail but sent to Bahia, where
he had to live under house arrest. The military forced him into exile
along with other artists, including Gil.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned in 1972, Brazil had changed dramatically, even
though the dictators were still in power. It was slowly becoming a
more cosmopolitan society.</TE>
<TE>   Today, after almost 20 years of democracy, Brazil is more
culturally confident than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to feel we were at a lower level," he says. "Now things
are almost the opposite. We feel we can invent new things for
ourselves. Even when I was very young, Brazilians believed that we
are a sad people. That changed from the '70s on. Now it's almost
official that we are happy."</TE>
<TE>   These days, Brazilian artists experiment and expropriate without
inhibitions, much like the tropicalistas did a generation ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes Brazilian popular music has this ambition of being even
better than American popular music," he says. And yet "we are
supposed to be a failure. A tropical failure. I love being Brazilian
and facing these contradictions. I wouldn't have preferred being born
anywhere else, even though I have suffered for it. I know people who
say, 'Why was I born in such a backward country?' but I don't feel
that way. I feel I've been gifted."</TE>
<TE>   A nation in turmoil</TE>
<TE>   Outside, it has been one of those normal Rio de Janeiro days of
chaos. Just up the hill from Veloso's office in the neighborhood of
Gavea, a group of Greenpeace activists with mountaineering gear has
been arrested after climbing the 260-foot tall Christ statue on
Corcovado mountain, hanging a protest banner from its arm.</TE>
<TE>   A blimp floats past Jesus. It's a remote-controlled eye in the sky
spying on the lives of people below, the latest police tool in the
fight against the city's rampant lawlessness. A few days later, the
crime wave will reach even to the Ipanema neighborhood where Veloso
lives with his second wife, Paula Lavigne, and their two young sons.
(Veloso splits his time between his apartment here and a home in
Bahia.)</TE>
<TE>   The drug dealers who run many of Rio's poorest neighborhoods will
order a citywide day of "protest," ordering businesses to close in an
effort to improve the treatment of crime bosses behind bars. Even the
merchants in Ipanema will be forced to comply.</TE>
<TE>   But there are larger issues. The economy is slowing, and Brazil's
foreign debt is reaching critical levels. The country's currency, the
real, is plummeting in value because the financial markets are afraid
that a leftist -- Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva -- is about to be elected
president. (The runoff is today.)</TE>
<TE>   Veloso, who made no endorsement in this election, says he feels
apprehensive about the future. "In the end, what we all want and need
is a transformation of this inhuman distribution of wealth."</TE>
<TE>   Millions of poor and disenfranchised people are still pressing for
change. More and more black Brazilians talk about recovering their
cidadania (citizenship) and fighting exclusao, discrimination. For
the first time in Brazilian history, there is an affirmative- action
movement.</TE>
<TE>   Veloso's time in jail during the dictatorship opened his eyes to
some of the grimmer aspects of Brazilian racism. In "Tropical Truth"
he writes about seeing firsthand that a dark-skinned man is much more
likely to be tortured than a light-skinned man, a reality that
persists today in Brazilian prisons.</TE>
<TE>   It is one of the many paradoxes of race in Brazil. Like other
corners of the Americas, it has a clear racial hierarchy that confers
status to those of European descent. At the same time, the races mix
more freely here than almost anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   "In the USA, if you're not entirely white, then you're black,"
Veloso observes. "It has never been like that in Brazil. Here most
people believe that everybody has at least one drop of black blood in
their veins. It's part of our national myth."</TE>
<TE>   In "Minha Formacao," Nabuco muses on these contradictions. Even
when slavery existed, the categories were not as rigid as they were
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "A black slave could buy his freedom," Veloso says. "And once free
he was like any other free person. He could even buy a baby slave
that might be the child of his ex-master."</TE>
<TE>   "Minha Formacao" set Veloso to thinking about modern black
identity in Brazil, and eventually took him to the streets of Bahia
and a collaboration with some of the city's young, hip-hop-loving
drummers. On the title track of "Noites do Norte" -- whose lyrics
come entirely from a paragraph in Nabuco's book -- drums filter in
and out of a string-orchestra arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   Slavery, Veloso sings, "breathed into the land its childish
spirit, its sadness without substance, its tears without bitterness,
its unfocused silence.... "</TE>
<TE>   The subject of race touches on many topics for Veloso, even on the
question of his age. He just turned 60 and is of the same generation
as Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, who are touring the United States,
enduring the usual questions about whether they are too old to be
rock 'n' roll stars. Veloso doesn't understand why.</TE>
<TE>   "Think about black artists like James Brown or Little Richard. I
never hear people saying to them, 'You're too old to move your hips,
or whatever.' If you're white, it's different. I think it has to do
with the aspect of self-disrespect that rock 'n' roll includes. It's
not acceptable for the mature white man."</TE>
<TE>   Veloso considers this for a moment and then says, "Let them rock."</TE>
<TE>   As for himself, he adds, "I'm not black or white. I'm both."</TE>

<LD>"Alias" is a dramatic, sometimes dark spy series -- one in which the
characters have at various times had teeth pulled out by pliers and
been shot up with heroin -- but a recent event honoring the show
played like a situation comedy.</LD>
<LD>   An overflow crowd attended an Oct. 14 tribute to the ABC series at
the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences in North Hollywood,
featuring series creator J.J. Abrams, star Jennifer Garner and
others, including Victor Garber, who -- despite playing Garner's
usually dour father in the show -- provided many of the laughs.</LD>
<LD>   "One glass of Merlot, and 'spy daddy' is doing stand-up," Garner
quipped.</LD>
<TE>   A few of the other lines:</TE>
<TE>   Co-star Kevin Weisman, who, like Garner, appeared on Abrams'
earlier show "Felicity," explaining how he got the part: "I had also
worked on 'Felicity,' where I also met my husband, Scott Foley."
(Garner is married to Foley.)</TE>
<TE>   Executive producer John Eisendrath, on Abrams' rare generosity as
a collaborator: "Absolute power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts
absolutely. And there's nothing like the absolute power of creating a
TV show."</TE>
<TE>   Abrams, on the capacity crowd: "This is wild and surreal."</TE>

Katie, Matt, Al and Ann [of NBC's "Today Show"] because there are so

<HD>Chief's Most Important Job</HD>

<LD>One bullet cut down an 8-year-old boy playing in a city park. Another
blew away an 11-year-old girl in a parked pickup. Separate shootings
felled three 19-year-olds -- one a construction worker, one a private
security guard, one a Marine home on leave to visit his mother. The
blast that ended the life of a 25-year-old ABC sitcom assistant came
as he waited to make a left turn.</LD>
<LD>   William H. Bratton will be publicly sworn in Monday as Los
Angeles' police chief. His most important and toughest job will be to
protect and serve neighborhoods under siege, not by a sniper but by
the street gangs responsible for each of the above deaths.</LD>
<LD>   In a city where gangs are suspected in more than 300 of the 539
homicides so far this year, kindergartners in the killing zones know
to duck under desks at the first crack of gunfire. The year's toll
includes a 3-year-old killed in his father's arms and a 2-month-old
strapped inside a car in front of her grandmother's house. Even
without a warning from a maniacal sniper, parents in these
neighborhoods know that their kids are not safe anywhere, anytime.</LD>
<TE>   Bratton shows good instincts in making murderous gangbangers his
priority, ingenuity in using computers to map and target their
criminal benders. Because shooting each other is seldom gangsters'
sole antisocial behavior, Bratton will make sure robbery detectives
tell the gang detail when, say, Crips are suspected in a market
holdup.</TE>
<TE>   In the chief's old turf back East, juveniles kill and get killed
in the hours between school and dinnertime. In balmy Los Angeles, the
peak time is late at night, winter, spring, summer or fall. Back
East, gangs and drugs are like bagels and lox. Here, some gangs sling
crack, but others blast away solely over slights and turf in
neighborhoods crammed with new immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Computer mapping -- and smart insiders -- will help the new chief
learn these patterns and assign officers accordingly. Then Los
Angeles residents will have to adjust. Targeted policing cares less
about the random patrols and rapid response that make relatively safe
residents feel safer than about predicting where criminals are going
to do bad things and getting cops there ahead of time.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's critics say New York's dramatic drop in crime while he
was chief would have happened anyway, as it did nationwide during
those years. By 1994, the crack epidemic that caused such mayhem in
the 1980s had waned; the 6% of young men who criminologists tell us
regularly become chronic offenders were either in jail or the morgue.
And the economy boomed -- providing not only jobs but money for New
York to hire hundreds of additional police officers.</TE>
<TE>   Now the economy is shrinking, the population of young men in the
crime-prone adolescent years is swelling, homicides are up, money is
tight and Bratton's department is short 1,000 officers -- although if
that number were hired tomorrow he'd remain woefully understaffed.
And starting tomorrow, the chief will be routinely attacked by cops
and citizens who will loudly proclaim themselves experts on all the
problems they've spent years failing to solve.</TE>
<TE>   What an opportunity for the new chief to prove the critics wrong
-- and what better way to do that than by finally taking the city
back from the criminal gangs that terrorize too many neighborhoods.</TE>

<HD>The Secret War</HD>
<DH>Frustrated by intelligence failures, the Defense Department
is dramatically expanding its 'black world' of covert operations</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William M. Arkin</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a military affairs analyst who
writes regularly for Opinion. E-mail: warkin@igc.org</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SOUTH POMFRET, Vt. -- In what may well be the largest expansion of
covert action by the armed forces since the Vietnam era, the Bush
administration has turned to what the Pentagon calls the "black
world" to press the war on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Department is building up an elite secret army with
resources stretching across the full spectrum of covert capabilities.
New organizations are being created. The missions of existing units
are being revised. Spy planes and ships are being assigned new
missions in anti-terror and monitoring the "axis of evil."</LD>
<LD>   The increasingly dominant role of the military, Pentagon officials
say, reflects frustration at the highest levels of government with
the performance of the intelligence community, law enforcement
agencies and much of the burgeoning homeland security apparatus. It
also reflects the desire of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to
gain greater overall control of the war on terror.</LD>
<TE>   Insulated from outside pressures, armed with matchless weapons and
technology, trained to operate below the shadow line, the Pentagon's
black world of classified operations holds out the hope of swift,
decisive action in a struggle against terrorism that often looks more
like a family feud than a war.</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with the enormous effort being made throughout the
government to improve and link information networks and databases,
covert anti-terror operations promise to put better information in
the hands of streamlined military teams that can identify, monitor
and neutralize terrorist threats.</TE>
<TE>   "Prevention and preemption are ... the only defense against
terrorism," Rumsfeld said in May. "Our task is to find and destroy
the enemy before they strike us."</TE>
<TE>   The new apparatus for covert operations and the growing government
secrecy associated with the war on terrorism reflect the way the Bush
administration's most senior officials see today's world:</TE>
<TE>   First, they see fighting terrorism and its challenge to U.S.
interests and values as the 21st century equivalent of the Cold War
crusade against communism. Second, they believe the magnitude of the
threat requires, and thus justifies, aggressive new "off-the-books"
tactics.</TE>
<TE>   In their understandable frustration over continued atrocities such
as the recent Bali attack, however, U.S. officials might keep two
points in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Though covert action can bring quick results, because it is
isolated from the normal review processes it can just as quickly
bring mistakes and larger problems. Also, the Pentagon is every bit
as capable as the civilian side of the government when it comes to
creating organization charts and bureaucracy that stifle creative
thinking and timely action.</TE>
<TE>   The development of the Pentagon's covert counter-terror capability
has its roots in the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. The Army created a
highly compartmentalized organization that could collect clandestine
intelligence independent of the rest of the U.S. intelligence
community and follow through with covert military action.</TE>
<TE>   Known as the Intelligence Support Activity, or ISA, when it was
established in 1981, this unit fought in drug wars and counter-terror
operations from the Middle East to South America. It built a
reputation for daring, flexibility and a degree of lawlessness.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1982, Deputy Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci called the
ISA "uncoordinated and uncontrolled." Though its freelance tendencies
were curbed, the ISA continued to operate under different guises
through the ill-starred U.S. involvement in Somalia in 1992 and was
reportedly active in the hunt for Bosnian Serbs suspected of war
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the ISA operates under the code name Gray Fox. In addition
to covert operations, it provides the war on terrorism with the kind
of so-called "close-in" signals monitoring -- including the
interception of cell phone conversations -- that helped bring down
Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar.</TE>
<TE>   Gray Fox's low-profile eavesdropping planes also fly without
military markings. Working closely with Special Forces and the CIA,
Gray Fox also places operatives inside hostile territory.</TE>
<TE>   In and around Afghanistan, Gray Fox was part of a secret sphere
that included the CIA's paramilitary Special Activities Division and
the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command.</TE>
<TE>   These commands and "white" Special Forces like the Green Berets,
as well as Air Force combat controllers and commandos of eight
different nations report to a mind-boggling array of new command
cells and coordination units set up after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   An Army brigadier general commands the Joint Interagency Task
Force at Bagram air base north of Kabul to coordinate CIA, Defense
Department and coalition forces in Afghanistan. A new Campaign
Support Group has been established at Ft. Bragg, N.C. The Special
Operations Joint Interagency Collaboration Center has been created in
Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, the Joint Interagency Coordination Group handles
information-sharing and logistical support with NATO. Hawaii's
Pacific Command stood up a Joint Interagency Counter-Terrorist Group
this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, old commands are being morphed into new ones for the
covert war. The two Joint Interagency Task Forces in the United
States previously devoted to fighting drugs now have the war on
terrorism as their highest priority.</TE>
<TE>   The epicenter of the Pentagon's covert operations remains the
North Carolina-based Joint Special Operations Command, often referred
to as Delta Force. The super-secret command is still not officially
acknowledged to exist. Its two-star commander, Army Maj. Gen. Dell L.
Dailey, who spent much of the Afghan war in Oman, has no public
biography.</TE>
<TE>   Among Dailey's assets is a fleet of aircraft specially equipped
for secret operations -- conventional and covert military planes and
helicopters, and even former Soviet helicopters. The bulk of those
craft, including the reconfigured Russian choppers, fly from
airfields in Uzbekistan and from two Pakistani air bases, Shahbaz and
Shamsi.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force and the CIA collect additional intelligence from
unmanned Predator and Global Hawk drones. They also have low-profile
reconnaissance assets that look like transport planes and operate
under such code names as ARL-Low, Keen Sage, Scathe View and Senior
Scout.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be left out, the Navy's Gray Star spy vessel, reminiscent
of the old Pueblo, captured by North Korea in 1968, now sweeps up
sophisticated -- and obscure -- "measurements and signatures
intelligence" to monitor the ballistic missile capabilities of Iraq,
Iran and North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Even with all this, the Pentagon wants to expand covert
capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's influential Defense Science Board 2002 Summer Study on
Special Operations and Joint Forces in Support of Countering
Terrorism says in its classified "outbrief" -- a briefing drafted to
guide other Pentagon agencies -- that the global war on terrorism
"requires new strategies, postures and organization."</TE>
<TE>   The board recommends creation of a super-Intelligence Support
Activity, an organization it dubs the Proactive, Preemptive
Operations Group, (P2OG), to bring together CIA and military covert
action, information warfare, intelligence, and cover and deception.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, this body would launch secret operations aimed
at "stimulating reactions" among terrorists and states possessing
weapons of mass destruction -- that is, for instance, prodding
terrorist cells into action and exposing themselves to
"quick-response" attacks by U.S. forces.</TE>
<TE>   Such tactics would hold "states/sub-state actors accountable" and
"signal to harboring states that their sovereignty will be at risk,"
the briefing paper declares.</TE>
<TE>   Never to be outdone in proposing hardware solutions, the Air Force
is designing its own Global Response Task Force to fight the war on
terrorism. The all-seeing, all-bombing Air Force envisions unmanned
A-X aircraft capable of long-range, nighttime gunship operations and
an M-X covert transport, as well as hypersonic and space-based
conventional weapons capable of delivering a "worldwide attack within
an hour."</TE>
<TE>   Who says the arms race is over? Rumsfeld's science board warns
against overemphasis on equipment even as it recommends more.
Washington is well on its way to an arms race with itself.</TE>
<TE>   And for those who worry that all these secret operations and
aggressive new doctrines will turn the United States into the world's
policeman, there is a ray of hope.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld is now the field marshal of the war on terrorism, but the
Pentagon is also creating new layers of bureaucracy that may save it
from itself. Not to mention the rest of us.</TE>

<HD>Restraint Saved the Day in 1962</HD>

<BD>Ann Louise Bardach is the author of "Cuba Confidential:
Love and Vengeance in Miami and Havana" and the editor of "Cuba: A
Traveler's Literary Companion."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first and only time the United States faced the real prospect of
nuclear apocalypse was 40 years ago today. That was the day that a
Russian missile, launched on the order of Fidel Castro, shot down an
American U-2 spy plane, killing its pilot and catapulting the world
to the brink of a nuclear war.</LD>
<LD>   Today, as we stand poised for war with Iraq, it would be foolish
not to examine the lessons learned from the Cuban missile crisis, and
how restraint saved the day. We didn't get the regime change we were
seeking, and in fact have yet to see a regime change in Cuba. But
neither did we embark on a war fueled by nuclear weapons that would
have changed the world as we know it.</LD>
<LD>   From the moment Castro came to power, the U.S. began plotting to
get rid of him. There were numerous clandestine attempts to do away
with the Cuban leader -- many of them bordering on the loony. The
most costly attempt, both in lives lost and political capital
squandered, was the humiliating 1961 CIA-backed invasion of Cuba's
Bay of Pigs. Preparation for the mission began in March 1960 under
President Eisenhower, who ordered CIA Director Allen Dulles to begin
training Cuban exiles for a planned invasion of Cuba. Eisenhower left
office the next year with a warning to his successor, John F.
Kennedy, that "the United States cannot allow the Castro government
to continue to exist in Cuba."</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy agreed and was keen to displace Castro, but he strongly
favored covert action over direct intervention. In the spring of
1961, he signed off on a secret CIA plan for an exile force to invade
Cuba from its southern shore at Bahia de los Cochinos -- the Bay of
Pigs.</TE>
<TE>   Almost every element of the planning and execution of the
operation guaranteed its failure, beginning with its grievous
underestimation of the depth of popular support behind the Cuban
revolution and the preparedness of Castro. Some within the
administration and Pentagon had entertained grave misgivings about
the plan based on internal analyses, but they hoped the military
would be summoned to the rescue if the attack foundered.</TE>
<TE>   It was not to be. A force of 1,300 Cuban exiles stormed the beach
on the morning of April 17. They were quickly vanquished by a large
and well-organized Cuban force. When the smoke had cleared, more than
100 members of the U.S.-backed force were dead. The rest surrendered
and were taken captive. No U.S. military force came to the rescue. It
turned out that Kennedy had meant what he said: There would be no
overt U.S. action.</TE>
<TE>   America's defeat to Castro's forces on the shores of southern Cuba
conferred an international celebrity on the Cuban strongman: He was
David, successfully vanquishing the Ugly American Goliath. The
debacle, in the opinion of many historians, also led to the Cuban
missile crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to neutralize his northern neighbor, Castro began an
all-out seduction of his Soviet allies, convincing Premier Nikita
Khrushchev that serious firepower was needed to deter another U.S.
invasion. In 1962, the Soviet Union surreptitiously installed
intermediate-range nuclear missiles in the western province of Pinar
del Rio.</TE>
<TE>   On learning of the action, Kennedy moved quickly, ordering a naval
quarantine of Cuba to intercept Soviet ships before the missiles
could be made battle-ready. On Oct. 22, based on CIA reports that the
Soviet Union was constructing sites for intermediate-range nuclear
missiles in Cuba, the U.S. evacuated all nonessential personnel from
the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay. At 7 p.m., Kennedy addressed
the country on national television, revealing that there were nuclear
missile sites in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   With the two superpowers poised on a nuclear precipice,
negotiations took on an urgent intensity. On Oct. 26, in a secret
communication, Khrushchev agreed not to break the U.S. blockade and
offered to withdraw Soviet missiles from Cuba if the United States
pledged not to invade Cuba and agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles
from Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   But while the two statesmen were negotiating, Castro, with
characteristic hubris and belligerence, had other ideas. A day after
Khrushchev and Kennedy began brokering an agreement, Cuba shot down a
U.S. surveillance plane. According to Carlos Franqui, a Castro
biographer and former confidante, it was Castro himself who
impulsively activated the missile that shot down the American U-2 spy
plane, killing its pilot, U.S. Air Force Major Rudolf Anderson. Then
Castro reportedly turned, faced his stupefied Russian advisors and
said, "Well, now we'll see if there's war or not."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy resisted the provocation, understanding what failed
negotiations would mean: war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
Despite Cuba's hostile action, he was determined to let diplomacy
play out. Kennedy wrote Khrushchev and told him that the U.S. would
not invade Cuba if Russia removed its missiles from Cuba. Privately,
U.S. Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy informed the Soviets that the U.S.
would withdraw its missiles from Turkey once the crisis was resolved.
The Russians agreed.</TE>
<TE>   A nuclear nightmare was averted because both President Kennedy and
Premier Khrushchev moved with exceeding caution and restraint.</TE>
<TE>   Today's situation is not entirely analogous. The U.S. has a strong
desire to effect regime change in a country that it feels is a
serious threat. But there is no third party that can be used to put
pressure on Saddam Hussein in the way that Khrushchev was able to
leverage Castro.</TE>
<TE>   Still, President Bush would do well to meditate upon Kennedy's
patient strategizing and restraint. It is unlikely that anyone today
would argue that we should have gone to war with Cuba in 1962.
Perhaps we would have ousted Castro -- but at what cost?</TE>

<KH>SAN FERNANDO VALLEY</KH>
<HD>Anger Will Burn On Even if Secession Is Voted Down</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David DeVoss</AU>
<BD>David DeVoss heads the East-West News Service in
Sherman Oaks.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Smoked salmon, roast beef and other hors d'oeuvres covered the buffet
table. Vocalist Nell Carter waited in the living room, ready to
entertain guests. But the atmosphere at last week's fund-raiser for
San Fernando Valley mayoral candidate Mel Wilson wasn't festive.</LD>
<LD>   A recent poll indicated that Valley secession was in jeopardy.
Underscoring the lack of momentum was the fact that more than half of
the two dozen people attending the fund-raiser were relatives,
business acquaintances or old family friends. While not conceding
defeat, Wilson, a Democrat and a Realtor in Woodland Hills, was
upset.</LD>
<LD>   "The Democratic Party has taken a walk on the entire issue,
despite the fact that most voters feel disenfranchised and
mistreated," he said with a sigh. "We have a mayor with no vision who
has ceded leadership to an enormous political machine financed by
labor unions and wealthy political contributors. It will be a
challenge to put this city back together."</LD>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn says the Nov. 5 election will put an end to
secession as a political issue. If Measures F (Valley secession) and
H (Hollywood secession) are defeated, he promises to lobby for a
state law preventing future cityhood efforts.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn misses the point. The goal of secession is to create a
municipal government responsive to the needs of ordinary residents
who want more libraries, a more visible police presence, and clean
and safe neighborhoods. The easiest way to prevent future secession
efforts is to reform L.A.'s bloated and inefficient bureaucracy that
currently serves only itself and the interests of selected property
developers.</TE>
<TE>   Financed by $5 million in acknowledged contributions, plus
millions in services from city unions, Hahn's disingenuous
anti-secession campaign has laid the foundation for continuing
discontent. According to a study conducted by the Local Agency
Formation Commission, a new Valley city would enjoy a budgetary
surplus without having to raise any new taxes. Yet Hahn's campaign
says secession is a dangerous gamble that would lead to higher taxes
and diminished services.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of separation, the L.A. Department of Water and
Power would be required, as a matter of law, to provide utilities at
the same rates charged the remaining parts of Los Angeles. But L.A.
United insists that an independent Hollywood and Valley city would
have to pay more.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-secession campaign plays on the fears of the working
class, insisting that newly independent cities would eliminate unions
and abolish rent control. But every candidate for office in the new
Valley city supports rent control and has pledged to continue the
existing salary structure for municipal employees.</TE>
<TE>   City Hall says that size is a virtue when it comes to securing
federal and state grants, and that a large city's economies of scale
result in an efficient distribution of assets. But studies conducted
as a result of the secession campaign show otherwise. A 2001 survey
of 44 cities by the Reason Public Policy Institute ranked Los Angeles
last in efficient use of taxpayer money. This year, the Rose
Institute of State and Local Government at Claremont McKenna College
found that, on a per capita basis, L.A. ranked below Santa Monica,
Long Beach and Glendale when it came to federal funding.</TE>
<TE>   City Hall does even worse when it goes after state money. San
Francisco gets twice as much per capita in state money even though
Los Angeles is about five times larger.</TE>
<TE>   One thing Los Angeles does not lack is hyperbole. Former Mayor
Richard Riordan says secession is "immoral." Hahn prophesies that
secession would bring "a disaster of biblical proportion." But the
defeat of secession as a political issue wouldn't eliminate the
uncomfortable fact that Los Angeles lags behind other large cities in
providing basic services.</TE>
<TE>   Of the five largest cities in the country, Los Angeles has the
fewest police and firefighters, according to a study by The Times. It
resurfaces a smaller percentage of its streets each year than New
York, Chicago or Philadelphia, and even ranks below Houston in branch
libraries.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists blame most of Los Angeles' problems on its lavishly
paid City Council, whose 15 members (paid $136,000 a year) each
represent about 240,000 people. Should secession be defeated, they
would push for smaller council districts or a borough system of
government. Neither solution has much chance of adoption, because
voters in the Valley, as well as in the Los Angeles Basin, appear
reluctant to create another level of bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   A key issue in the secession campaign has been inadequate
policing. The Valley has an estimated 80 gangs with 20,000 members.
Its homicide rate has soared 90% since 2000. "I pay taxes for 2,200
police, but only 1,500 are stationed in the Valley," laments Rick
Rolda, assistant director of admissions at DeVry University.
"Criminals are so mobile that there's no longer such a thing as a
safe neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, secession's defeat would not improve police
protection. More than $35 million already has been paid out because
of tainted testimony given by Rampart Division's anti-gang unit.
Lawyers estimate that final damages may exceed $100 million. City
Hall's failure to police its police will limit its efforts to ensure
safe streets for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' origin is rooted in Spain's conquest of the New
World, but its system of government largely derives from Midwest
progressives who created citizen commissions to oversee the work of
the municipal bureaucracy. That system doesn't function, however,
when the appointed commissioners are absentee politicians or
political contributors with a vested interest in city business.</TE>
<TE>   Look at the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. Endowed with
a $3-million annual budget from fees paid by companies filming in
L.A., it was created seven years ago to prevent runaway film
production. Instead, it spent thousands of dollars on lavish dinners,
donated $10,000 to a film commission in Pennsylvania and contributed
nearly $200,000 to political committees, including more than a dozen
run by elected officials serving on its board. Though $25,000 it
donated to Hahn's anti-secession campaign has been returned, the city
Ethics Commission has made no move to remove corporation President
Cody Cluff.</TE>
<TE>   "People have a Pollyanna view of Los Angeles, but it's become a
pay-to-play city," says Richard Katz, who heads the San Fernando
Valley Independence Committee. "The biggest contributors to the
anti-secession effort are the power players who want status quo at
City Hall."</TE>
<TE>   Voters may decide to keep Los Angeles intact on Nov. 5, but
secession will remain a political issue as long as neighborhoods are
ignored. If the Valley is an integral part of Los Angeles, then it
should receive all the services for which its residents pay. The
demand for a more responsive city within or outside current
boundaries will continue as long as the Sunshine Canyon landfill
remains open and ludicrous schemes like "toilet to tap" remain in
play. Turning a portion of the Sepulveda Basin into a sludge pit,
then calling it "a wetlands sanctuary for migrating waterfowl," will
only energize a new generation of secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   "Secessionists don't want to leave L.A., just live in a city that
works," says mayoral candidate Wilson. "I know [City Council
President] Alex Padilla cares about his community, but not even he
can deliver. It's sad that a city gets so large that not even its
leaders have the power to bring about constructive change."</TE>

<AU>J. William Gibson</AU>
<BD>J. William Gibson is a professor of sociology at Cal
State Long Beach.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a stench of death in the air these days.</LD>
<LD>   In Northern California, gill rot killed an estimated 30,000
chinook salmon in the Klamath River, a devastating loss in light of
the long-term decline of salmon populations in the river. In the
Canary Islands, 15 beaked whales beached themselves as they died from
hemorrhages in and around their brains. Over the summer, fire
destroyed hundreds of thousands of prime forest acres in Arizona,
Colorado and other Western states.</LD>
<LD>   Is apocalypse near? Maybe. But before concluding that a wrathful
deity wants blood, it's important to learn how each of these
disasters could have been prevented if environmental policymakers, in
both the Bush administration and previous ones, had been paying
attention to how ecosystems work.</LD>
<TE>   In order to reproduce this fall, salmon needed to swim up a
plentiful Klamath River. But a drought dating at least to spring 2001
has made water scarce in the Klamath watershed in southern Oregon and
Northern California. Studies conducted by California Department of
Fish and Game biologists showed just how much water young salmon need
to survive. Yet in March, U.S. Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton and
Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman opened the gates of the dam and
diverted the water to farmers. As a result, the river below the dam
received 20% to 30% less water this spring and summer than in 2001.
With less water in the river, returning salmon were forced into
shallow, warm pools -- perfect incubators for disease. Gill rot
quickly decimated the fall run.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials immediately denied any
responsibility. "No one has ever seen a problem like this," said a
spokesperson from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, "and it may very
well turn out to be a natural phenomenon." The chairwoman of the
Yurok Indians, a tribe that has lived and fished along the Klamath
for thousands of years, had a different explanation. "We begged them
for more water, starting in the spring," said Sue Masten. "They
ignored us."</TE>
<TE>   The circumstances surrounding the whales' deaths produced similar
denials from government officials. The whales didn't just happen to
beach themselves. Instead, they died after U.S. and NATO warships
tested high-intensity sonar systems in their habitat areas. Although
a Navy spokesperson said that "it would be inappropriate to speculate
on the cause of the stranding," necropsies of the whales showed brain
and hearing damage, the kind of wounds caused by intense sound waves.
Sonar tests conducted since the mid-1990s have had similar effects on
whales. Nevertheless, more such tests are planned as part of the
Navy's next generation of anti-submarine warfare.</TE>
<TE>   And what of the fires that ravaged Western forests over the
summer? Half a century of attempts to manage nature boomeranged. For
all the cuddly charm of Smokey Bear and his pleas to stamp out forest
fires, the no-burn policy inadvertently created conditions for
extremely intense, destructive fires. Environmental researchers know
as much. Before modern times, they found, fire was not alien to
forest ecosystems. Naturally occurring fires and those set by Native
Americans helped renew the ecosystems.</TE>
<TE>   When fires occurred with some regularity, they burned off
underbrush and smaller trees; older, larger and stronger trees
withstood the flames. In places where Indians practiced controlled
burns, such as in Yosemite Valley, astonishing beauty flourished. The
no-fire policy, by contrast, allowed underbrush to thicken and small
trees to multiply.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1950s, the timber industry's practice of clear-cutting
has compounded the problem. Clear-cutting takes out all the trees at
the same time it creates mammoth piles of dried-out brush and
saplings -- even more fuel for forest fires. Unfortunately, these
fires don't produce the same beneficial effects as the more limited
ones of earlier eras. Thus, the Bush administration's recent proposal
to allow timber companies to increase their clear-cutting in national
forests in order to protect the remaining lands from fire is bound to
fail.</TE>
<TE>   In all three cases, government officials apparently decided that
natural ecosystems exist for the good of the state and industry.
Nature can be forced to adapt to government's will: Salmon should
learn how to get by with less water; whales should learn to steer
clear of sonar tests; forests should adapt to government policies on
timber, recreation and housing development.</TE>
<TE>   But natural ecosystems aren't unruly children who can be cajoled
or socialized into behaving the way adults want. They have their own
histories dating back millions of years, their own "integrity," their
own ways of being. Although scientists still have much to learn about
the natural world, the broad parameters of most ecosystems are not a
mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Such knowledge should entail ethical responsibility. In the late
1940s, as the pace of society's destruction of nature rapidly
increased, a University of Wisconsin professor of game management,
Aldo Leopold, formulated "the land ethic." Society, he contended,
needed to embrace the land and its creatures as members of the human
community. They should be considered beings with rights and moral
worth. According to Leopold, when humans think about acting upon
nature, they should consider the impact of their intended action. "A
thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and
beauty of the biotic community," he wrote. "It is wrong when it tends
otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   What humans did to Klamath River's salmon, the oceans' whales and
Western forests violates Leopold's land ethic.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to accept responsibility for the mounting body count of
nature's creatures. The killing can be sharply reduced. Government
can buy out many of the farmers in the Klamath Basin at good prices
so that the river will have sufficient water for spawning salmon. The
Navy can change when and where it tests sonar systems. Clear-cutting
in national forests can be abolished and new fire policies
instituted.</TE>
<TE>   While we'll never restore Eden, at least we won't face apocalypse.</TE>

<HD>Ike-Like Diplomacy Instead of War</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>James E. Goodby</AU>
<BD>James E. Goodby entered the U.S. Foreign Service in the
Truman administration and retired during the Clinton administration,
when he was chief negotiator for the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat
Reduction programs.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A hostile government with evil designs and the means to
attack America with weapons of mass destruction. Could a preventive
war waged by the United States free the world of this danger?</LD>
<LD>   The Eisenhower administration, faced with this imminent threat,
considered the idea of a preventive war, then dismissed it. That
history has clear lessons for the Bush administration as it prepares
to wage war against Iraq to prevent Saddam Hussein from developing
nuclear bombs.</LD>
<LD>   When the Soviet Union, already armed with nuclear weapons,
acquired a long-range ballistic missile capability in 1957, Dwight
Eisenhower became the first president to face a new reality. The
United States was vulnerable to a nuclear attack that could kill
millions of Americans. It was a watershed in the history of a people
who believed that two oceans guaranteed their security.</LD>
<TE>   That sense of vulnerability could have devastated public morale
and led to cataclysmic war. It did not, and Eisenhower's handling of
that turning point in U.S. history testifies to his great leadership.
Unfortunately, he has not received the credit he deserves for this
achievement. Eisenhower kept the lid on a volatile situation as only
a president of his stature could, refusing to let America be turned
into what he called a "garrison state." It is certain that he would
have pressed for an allied response to today's military challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Hawks in his administration urged Eisenhower to adopt an
aggressive "rollback" or "line in the sand" policy toward the Soviet
Union. In the early 1950s, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had expected a
showdown with Moscow in 1959 or 1960, when the growing Soviet
stockpile of nuclear weapons would neutralize the U.S. advantage.
They pressed Eisenhower to go on the geopolitical offensive against
the threat. Adm. Arthur W. Radford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs,
told Eisenhower that forestalling Soviet action was far preferable to
reacting later.</TE>
<TE>   It is not surprising that, at such an unpredictable time, a
preventive war seemed a reasonable option. But, pragmatic realist
that he was, Eisenhower chose containment, a policy that required
patience and did not promise immediate results. He opposed unilateral
U.S. action, believing that allies were essential to achieving U.S.
interests in the international arena. His administration created the
military structure that undergirds nuclear deterrence. But to
Eisenhower, war was the last resort.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower instead wanted to open direct communications with
Moscow. In 1958, he proposed an international conference of experts
to discuss measures that might prevent a surprise attack. I
represented the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in that short-lived
conference in Geneva. The Soviet delegation, led by a senior member
of the Soviet government, pushed for comprehensive disarmament as the
best solution. The U.S. delegation tried to keep the focus on
technical issues.</TE>
<TE>   George B. Kistiakowsky, a top member of the U.S. delegation and
also of the team that developed the U.S. atomic bomb, spoke
passionately about the crossroads of technology and a ruthless enemy:
"The first act of a future war can be in itself a staggering human
catastrophe.... [It] may blow whole cities sky-high and annihilate
modern human society.... [An enemy would] try to choose as
instruments of [its] surprise attack those weapons systems and
aggressive forces [that would give no warning to] the prospective
victim and whose capabilities for quick devastation are greatest."</TE>
<TE>   These are conditions that cry out for preventive war. Eisenhower
faced a dictator with more blood on his hands than today's batch of
despots. Josef Stalin had killed not just thousands but millions of
his own people. His successor, Nikita S. Khrushchev, was more
moderate at home, but he recklessly sought to use growing Soviet
nuclear and missile capabilities to extract concessions from the
West.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower stood firm against both the advocates of preventive war
and the Soviets. He favored a strong defense, but he also believed in
the power of negotiations to solve international problems. The 1958
conference on preventing surprise nuclear attacks did not produce
direct results, but it encouraged high-level dialogue between the
U.S. and the USSR. Another Eisenhower-launched negotiation that year
did lead to a concrete outcome that helped turn the U.S.-Soviet
rivalry away from war: the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was
signed in 1963 during the Kennedy administration. The struggle
between the two powers lasted decades longer, but the likelihood of
nuclear war receded.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson? An assumption of inevitability, as Eisenhower might
say, is an abstraction that can get one down -- and lead to a
catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   Worry that nuclear arms or other weapons of mass destruction could
be acquired by rogue states also is not unprecedented in U.S.
experience. In the years after the communist revolution of 1949,
China was regarded by many as a rogue state. In the 1960s, when it
was on the brink of acquiring nuclear weapons, there was some talk at
high levels in both the U.S. and Soviet governments of a "surgical
strike," a form of preventive war. Again, the hand of war was stayed,
and China today is an ally in the global war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson? History seems to have a way of refuting those who say
time is not on our side.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower's emphasis on the long haul, his distaste for borrowing
trouble from an uncertain future, his vision of what a democratic
society should be, and his willingness to try diplomacy served us
well when we faced the threat of imminent destruction in the 1950s.
His style of statecraft could serve us well today.</TE>

<HD>Tibet Issue Is Ripe for Solving</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>BERKELEY -- A great opportunity was lost Friday when President Bush
met with Chinese President and Communist Party Chairman Jiang Zemin
without taking up the situation in Tibet.</LD>
<LD>   China held out a tantalizing hope last month in hosting a
delegation from the Dalai Lama's government in exile on a visit to
China and Tibet. Now would have been the moment to advance that
initiative.</LD>
<LD>   But it is still not too late to take up the challenge of resolving
Tibet's status, a problem that has long bedeviled Tibetans and ethnic
Chinese alike. In fact, Hu Jintao, who appears slated to assume
leadership of China next month when Jiang steps down, was China's
party secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region from 1988 to 1992.
Understanding the complexities of Tibet's difficult relationship with
China puts him in an excellent position to distinguish the beginning
of his tenure as supreme leader of China by helping to untie this
Gordian knot.</LD>
<TE>   If Hu fails to address issues of human rights in Tibet and the
region's desire for autonomy, his country will be the worse for his
lapse. In the Palestinian territories, in Kashmir, in the former
Yugoslavia, we have seen how unattended conflicts with ethnic
subtexts can erupt in ways that make them virtually impossible to
solve. It's in China's interest not to let that happen in Tibet.</TE>
<TE>   When Jiang's government met last month with Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari
and Kelsang Gyaltsen, representatives of the Dalai Lama's government
in exile, it seemed to indicate a new flexibility on the part of
Beijing -- a flexibility that will be necessary if China wants to
resolve its long-standing differences with Tibet. On assuming office,
Hu should follow up on this initial olive branch with further
initiatives aimed at advancing the situation toward a truly durable
solution.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Tibet is not beyond remedy. And one can hardly
imagine a better way for a Chinese leader to establish himself in
office than to offer a peaceful solution.</TE>
<TE>   The Dalai Lama has proposed a reasonable compromise: In return for
a high degree of Tibetan autonomy and permission to return home to
Lhasa, his government in exile would yield to the Chinese
government's claim of sovereignty and its desire to continue
controlling Tibet's foreign affairs and defense.</TE>
<TE>   This is clearly a win-win-win proposition. China gains the Dalai
Lama's acknowledgment that Tibet is in fact a part of a multiethnic
China, thereby removing the contentious issue of independence from
the board. Tibet wins China's agreement to allow the Dalai Lama to
return home and help stem the erosion of Tibetan Buddhism and
traditional culture that, with the large influx of Han Chinese, has
drawn the region ever deeper into the pull of Chinese cultural and
political gravity. And the world gains by being relieved of the
burden of a major point of global tension.</TE>
<TE>   A solution to the Tibet problem would greatly improve China's
global image. The situation in Tibet, which many around the world see
as a form of quasi-colonial occupation, has been an ongoing stain on
China's international reputation. Working out a solution that would
facilitate the Dalai Lama's return to Tibet would not only help
remove much of the stigma of the last half-century but would also
allow the Dalai Lama to help soothe and manage the tensions that have
built up over the years.</TE>
<TE>   While the situation may appear to have been superficially quiet of
late, it is no secret that smoldering resentments remain, and that
these resentments could easily lead to yet another overt conflict.
Should that happen, it might then be too late for the kind of
peaceful reconciliation that now offers itself as a real possibility.</TE>
<TE>   I have often, and only half-jokingly, noted to Chinese friends who
are wary of the Tibetan government in exile that most non-Chinese
world leaders would be only too happy to have the Dalai Lama as an
adversary. He is, after all, renowned for his tolerance, his good
sense and his compassion. Chinese officials must realize, having
recently hosted a Tibetan delegation, that in the Tibetans they have
an immensely reasonable partner for negotiation.</TE>
<TE>   Solving the Tibet problem in a peaceful, equitable and magnanimous
way would provide an extraordinary beginning to Hu's tenure as
China's leader. It would also be an astute way for China to continue
cementing better relations with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   For those of us watching around the world, a creative, new
solution to this long-stalemated issue would serve as a very
convincing sign that China was changing, maturing and becoming more
receptive to assuming a greater role on the global stage as a
constructive, reliable and forward-looking power. During this time of
deep anxiety over international terrorism and ethnic strife, such an
expression of Chinese leadership would go a long way to impressing
and reassuring the world. Hu could leave no greater legacy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After the Chinese government suppressed a student-led democracy
movement in Tiananmen Square in June 1989, the Bush administration
imposed economic sanctions on China, straining U.S.-China relations.
Three months later, T.D. Lee, an American Nobel laureate in physics
and a frequent guest of China's leaders, flew to Beijing to meet with
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. Upon his return to the U.S., Lee
traveled to Washington to brief then-President George H.W. Bush on
what Deng had told him: Despite the tension between the two
countries, China wanted to maintain close ties with the United
States. Lee thus had served as a crucial bridge between Washington
and Beijing at a time of crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Soon after his trip, Lee, together with other prominent Chinese
Americans, formed the Committee of 100. The group's founding members
included David Henry Hwang, Bette Bao Lord, Yo-Yo Ma, I.M. Pei,
Chang-lin Tien, S.B. Woo and Shirley Young. Their aim was to build
more bridges between the United States and China. To that end, they
have acted as intermediaries and consultants for both the U.S. and
Chinese governments, promoting greater dialogue across the Pacific.</LD>
<TE>   The work of the Committee of 100 highlights the increasing role
that Chinese Americans are playing in the evolution and development
of U.S.-China relations. Washington Gov. Gary Locke's highly
publicized trip to China in October 1997 is another example. Locke, a
U.S.-born Chinese, made his trip, which included a visit to his
grandparents' village in Canton, less than a year after his election
as governor. His goal was to strengthen the link between the two
countries.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese American scholars and activists -- among them Pei Minxin,
a senior associate of the Carnegie Foundation, and George Koo, a
community activist from Northern California -- have participated
extensively in debates on China's human rights policies, trade
disputes with the U.S., Washington's role in Taiwan and other issues
affecting U.S.-China relations.</TE>

foreign-affairs speech writer for Bill Clinton, sums up Chinese
Americans' growing interest and involvement in Sino-American
relations. "One way or another," he said in an interview, "I will
stay involved with politics and involved with China and Asia. Those
two areas seem really basic to me."</TE>
<TE>   Chinese Americans have become prominent players in the U.S.-China
game for more than reasons of ethnic solidarity. Advances in
information technology have certainly brought events in China and the
rest of Asia into Chinese American living rooms and stimulated
interest in Sino-American relations. The daily activities of
Beijing's leaders, Taiwan's parliamentary debates and the gyrations
of the Hong Kong stock market are common fare for discussion in
America's Chinatowns.</TE>
<TE>   More important is that the Chinese American community has become a
predominantly immigrant one since the 1960s, and, as such, is
sometimes vulnerable to the ups and downs of U.S.-China relations.
Although Chinese have settled in America in significant numbers since
the 1850s, nearly 70% of the 2.8 million Chinese living in the United
States today were born overseas. The increasing prominence of
international affairs in American domestic politics, in general, and
volatile U.S.-China relations, in particular, has compelled Chinese
Americans to get involved in the two countries' bilateral
relationship, sometimes out of self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   For example, when a U.S. Navy spy plane collided with a Chinese
fighter and was forced to land on a Chinese island in April 2001,
some callers to radio talk shows demanded that Chinese Americans be
sent to internment camps. As a result, many Chinese American
activists who used to focus on domestic issues now realize that they
can no longer remain on the sidelines of U.S.-China relations. They
need to get their perspective out.</TE>
<TE>   The globalization of the U.S. economy and the emergence of
trans-Pacific Chinese business networks have also heightened Chinese
Americans' interest in U.S.-China relations. Like their non-Chinese
counterparts, Chinese American entrepreneurs are eager to tap the
huge Chinese market. They hope that they can take advantage of their
Chinese heritage to reap profits from their ancestral homeland as
China evolves into a global manufacturing power. This is in part why
nearly 80% of direct foreign investment in China comes from Chinese
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   The huge increase in trade and business across the Pacific,
coupled with the rapid expansion of U.S. companies into Asia, has
further promoted networking between Chinese Americans and their "old
home." For example, since the 1970s, the amount of Chinese capital
flowing into the U.S. has varied from several billion dollars to more
than $10 billion annually. In just one week in July 1995, several
billion dollars of capital flowed from Taiwan into Southern
California because of tension in the Taiwan Strait. In addition,
since the 1990s, a growing number of Chinese Americans have returned
to China to start businesses or have been hired by U.S. companies to
manage offices there.</TE>
<TE>   Although Chinese Americans are getting more involved in U.S.-China
relations, they are anything but united in their attitudes toward
Beijing. This is especially true in the case of recent immigrants
from China. Those who actively participated in China's dissident
movement want to bring down the Beijing regime quickly and think a
containment policy would accomplish that goal.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese American entrepreneurs and those who work in China-related
professions, on the other hand, support engagement, believing that a
positive and healthy Sino-American relationship is the best way to
avoid confrontation. Having experienced hardships and difficulties in
China, they also know the intricacies involved in China's current
reform campaign and hold the view that only after China achieves a
relatively high level of economic prosperity can it afford the fruits
and the perils of democracy.</TE>
<TE>   This diversity of opinion among Chinese Americans toward China is
further illustrated in conflicting attitudes toward Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's visit last week to the U.S. and his meeting with
President Bush. While some held demonstrations against Jiang's visit,
others organized gatherings to welcome him. Speaking with more than
one voice may weaken Chinese Americans' influence on the development
of U.S.-China relations in the short run, but because such diversity
represents a balanced Chinese American view on China-related issues,
in the long run it will better serve their interests and promote a
healthy and stable relationship between the two countries.</TE>

<KH>JOHN BALZAR</KH>
<HD>Peering Into Darkness</HD>
<DH>In these murky days, war isn't the choice we would welcome,
but it's a risk we must face.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With war on my mind, I reread Joseph Conrad.</LD>
<LD>   "Heart of Darkness" is not a war book. Not about the Mideast. It's
not a tale of the global struggle of peoples or the clash of ideals,
not about the inflamed fanaticism of religion or the clamors of
democracy. For purposes of the moment, let's call it a novel about
human irresolution, about ambiguity, about the journey upriver into
shadows.</LD>
<LD>   We are strange people in the way we compartmentalize the important
things in our lives. In the literature that we rely on to make sense
of our human condition, we welcome doubt and uncertainty. These
things ignite our imaginations, renew our humility. They help us
reconcile ourselves to the fact that much of life is haphazard.</LD>
<TE>   On the other hand, our process of self-governance allows almost
nothing for these truths. Whether you see yourself as a down-to-earth
realist or a dreamy idealist, you must speak without equivocation if
you expect to be heard. Right or wrong? Yes or no? Never mind that
war is one of humanity's chanciest endeavors. In the prelude to war,
democracy bestows on adherents a remarkable capacity to channel the
future without clouds in their crystal balls.</TE>
<TE>   Last time around in the Gulf War, some antiwar isolationists
turned out to be right on one important point, but for precisely the
opposite reasons they predicted at the time. Yes, we're bogged down
in the region all these years later. But it isn't because the U.S.
military met its match against the battle-hardened Iraqi Republican
Guards. It's because U.S. politicians pulled up short after a
100-hour rout.</TE>
<TE>   Today, those who debate renewal of war against Iraq achieve moral
finality chiefly according to where they choose to start the
argument. The doves begin with the now. Why now? Peace now. The hawks
insist on winding the clock back a few years. How long, they ask, can
we ignore this tyrant in Iraq who shoots at our peacekeepers, who
impoverishes his people for the sake of his vainglory and who chips
away at global harmony with the inducement of oil? The
middle-of-the-roaders grasp for tomorrow, for the sake of
negotiations and resolution via resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   If you grant these views their logic, indeed their rightness, but
if you lack a crystal ball of your own, what choice do you have
except to dig deeper into our purpose and into our nature? I reread
Conrad.</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't looking to draw simple-minded metaphors from the title,
but to remind myself that when we are afloat on restless events,
complacency and peril are not always on opposite banks of the river.
The righteous clash of the hardheads and the soft-hearts serves
neither. It has not made us more secure. It has not diminished our
enemies or comforted our friends. It has not made the world a saner
or more hopeful place. It has not left our nation a prouder country.
At the turn of the century, our power exceeds our wisdom to use it.
You can set your moral compass there.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence can be seen in Iraq, where a loss of resolve in 1991
only deferred woe. Or in the face of unimaginable slaughter in
Rwanda, where President Clinton promised all the help we could give
and gave almost nothing. It was plain during the bloody dissolution
of Yugoslavia, when the U.S. and the U.N. were frozen numb by animal
fury. It showed in Somalia when Clinton lost his nerve and reneged on
peacekeeping in one of the most anguished countries of the world.
Because I was there to witness some of these events, because I found
myself ankle-deep in human goo, because after that you cannot wash
off the smell of human suffering, I believe the U.S. must rouse
itself.</TE>
<TE>   Events in this shrinking world have closed off the path of
retreat. The ground on which we stand is not solid. When you are
abroad, Americans sometimes look like the people they despise; the
gawkers who cannot bring themselves to step in and stop a rapist. You
can include the U.N. too. Improbably, it is President Bush who has
stepped forward. He has played big-stick diplomacy the only way it
can be played, with bravado. In turns, he has been steely and scary,
unrelenting and relenting. It is startling, unnerving, even
bewildering, to see this novice kick up such vast clouds of dust. But
really, the only door he has closed is to inaction.</TE>
<TE>   War? It's not the choice, but it's the risk. Bush's polarizing
domestic pursuits have left many thoughtful Americans with good
reason to doubt his word and his judgment. Has he chosen the right
target at the right time to make this stand? Probably. And that may
be as much certainty as we'll ever have with the world now ordered as
it is. No despot anywhere is so universally condemned as Saddam
Hussein. No place in the world produces so much hatred for our way of
life as the gridlocked Mideast, where even 5-year-olds learn to shake
their fists at the Great Satan. Why now? Why not now?</TE>
<TE>   I don't trust crystal balls. But some things along the journey are
worth fighting for. "The horror! The horror!" Those were Kurtz's last
words in "Heart of Darkness." Could that be a rallying cry against
war? Or against hesitation and diffidence? Conrad himself suggested
the answer, writing to a friend: "You know that in cowardice is every
evil."</TE>

<HD>Davis Is Playing Parole Politics</HD>
<DH>Willie Horton haunts the governor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Earl Ofari Hutchinson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The well-scripted ritual happened again when Gov. Gray Davis flatly
said no this month to parole for convicted murderer Jerilyn Becker.</LD>
<LD>   Davis has approved paroles for only two of the more than 100
convicted killers eligible during his term in office. But the Becker
denial was especially galling.</LD>
<LD>   In 22 years behind bars, she has maintained a spotless prison
record, counseled and ministered to hundreds of inmates and was
praised by her prison work supervisors and officials. As a free
woman, Becker could have been a model for the convicted killer turned
productive citizen.</LD>
<TE>   Davis said no to releasing Becker and other seemingly rehabbed
killers because the ghost of Willie Horton haunts him. Horton was a
convicted killer who, while on a weekend furlough from a
Massachusetts prison, beat a Maryland man and raped his fiancee.</TE>
<TE>   During the presidential elections in 1988, the elder George Bush
pounded his Democratic presidential opponent, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, on the Horton release. Democrats everywhere mumbled
a solemn pledge to themselves that they would not be outshouted again
by Republicans on the law-and-order issue.</TE>
<TE>   The soft-on-crime tag that Republicans plastered on Democrats
dates back to Richard Nixon's successful campaign in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon branded Democrats as permissive on crime for appointing
judges who he asserted let droves of dangerous criminals loose on the
streets. The Democrats screamed foul and claimed Nixon played the
crime card to stoke fear of black crime and violence to get white
votes.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP plan worked. Nixon was elected.</TE>
<TE>   Davis hasn't forgotten this political lesson. Even if he were
inclined to do the right thing and free Becker, he wouldn't. It's the
wrong place and the wrong political time for it.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has a Ft. Knox-size campaign war chest, the Democrats enjoy
a colossal registration edge over the state's Republicans, and
political gaffes dog opponent Bill Simon Jr.'s campaign. A big win in
November would catapult Davis into the thick of the hunt for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 2004. His release of a
convicted murderer, no matter how remote the possibility that he or
she would commit another crime, poses too much political peril.</TE>
<TE>   Playing hardball with the freedom of prisoners such as Becker, who
have turned their lives around, may be good politics, but it's bad
public policy.</TE>
<TE>   Only two other states, Maryland and Oklahoma, give governors the
power to veto decisions their parole boards make on prisoner
releases. In both states, the governors also have taken a granite
stance against releasing convicted killers. If they can use parole
for political ends and pander to public terror about crime and
violence to appease the voters, then the logical question is: Why
bother to have parole boards, or better yet, why bother to have
parole?</TE>
<TE>   In usurping the authority of their parole boards, Davis and the
other governors are in effect saying they have no confidence in their
own appointees. This creates the public impression that parole boards
cavalierly allow killers to waltz out of prison to pillage
communities. There is no evidence to support this.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say that Davis should have no say over parole
decisions. The governor must have the right to review the decisions.
But with the handful of convicted killers who have shown that they
have redeemed themselves, it makes no sense for Davis to hold them
hostages to political fears.</TE>
<TE>   As long as Republicans can use Willie Horton as a boogeyman to
politically terrorize Democrats, prisoners such as Becker will never
get the second chance they've earned.</TE>

<HD>The Public Has a Right to Know</HD>
<DH>Sniper case shows withholding details does not help police
investigations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph D. McNamara</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"I'm no hero," said truck driver Ron Lantz, whose phone call led to
the apprehension of two men suspected of being responsible for the
sniping rampage that left 10 people dead and three wounded in the
Washington, D.C., area.</LD>
<LD>   He's too modest. He not only recognized the suspects' New Jersey
license plate and called 911, he also blocked the highway exit with
his truck to prevent the men's escape until a law enforcement task
force arrived to arrest the armed men in their blue Chevrolet
Caprice.</LD>
<LD>   Lantz is the classic example of a responsible citizen being
alerted by vigorous news reporting and helping police capture two men
considered very dangerous.</LD>
<TE>   Underrecognized but equally heroic were the many uniformed
officers who had stood guard at school grounds, gas stations,
shopping malls and traffic barricades, knowing that they might be
fully exposed to a sniper.</TE>
<TE>   During my 35 years in policing, I always felt that having
dedicated officers working with citizens well informed by the news
media was the ideal way to minimize crime and disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, early in the 22 days of terror permeating the nation's
capital and its suburbs, some police leaders accused news
organizations and their reporters of interfering in the investigation
by interviewing witnesses and circulating erroneous descriptions of
vehicles and suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the police assertion -- that this led the public to look for
the wrong vehicle and wrong people -- doesn't make much sense because
police officials were not giving other, accurate information.</TE>
<TE>   And, according to the Washington Post, the accurate description of
the suspect's vehicle came from news reporting, not a police
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   This criticism should not detract from what appears to be an
excellent investigation by the sniper task force. However, no one
knows whether more people would have been murdered without forceful
news reporting and Lantz's sharp eyes and timely call.</TE>
<TE>   As Montgomery County Police Chief Charles A. Moose noted proudly
when announcing the arrests, people coped in the face of terror.
Children went to school, people worked and went on with their lives.</TE>
<TE>   But law enforcement and the rest of us should take a sharp lesson
from fearsome episodes like this one.</TE>
<TE>   The more information that people have, the more able they are to
make decisions and reconcile their apprehensions with the actual
level of risk. It seems incomprehensible that law enforcement brass
knew that the sniper had made a specific threat against children but
withheld the information for days. It is even more bewildering that a
major news agency apparently went along.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, some individuals have wrongly criticized Chief
Moose for communicating so cryptically and politely with the sniper.
Moose was using correct police procedure in trying to negotiate with
the killer. His goal, quite properly, was to stop the killings.</TE>
<TE>   It may offend people, but sometimes keeping up a dialogue with
terrorists, kidnappers and murderers can buy time and save lives. But
clarity and straightforwardness also serve the public good.</TE>
<TE>   A reporter directly asked the police chief after the arrests
whether people in the area no longer needed to fear this particular
killer. The chief hedged. It took a politician, the county executive,
to assure area residents that they no longer had to fear these
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   If the police chief believed that there was still danger, that
others involved in these gruesome crimes were still at large, he had
a duty to warn the public. If he believed the people under arrest
were indeed the ones responsible, there was no reason not to say so
in plain English.</TE>
<TE>   Hard questions still hang over the investigation: When and why
were calls from the sniper ignored? Should the killings and terror
have ended sooner? We will probably have to wait until reporters are
able to supply the answers.</TE>
<TE>   Police do have to keep some information confidential so that
suspects don't destroy evidence or evade capture and to detect the
inevitable false confessions that are made in well-publicized cases.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the basic lesson remains: The public has a right to know. The
old police mythology of withholding information is more likely to
impede than aid in solving crimes. An informed, law-abiding citizenry
is policing's most valuable asset.</TE>

<HD>Water Bond Masks an Insidious Land Grab</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Pauli</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consider the following facts:</LD>
<LD>   * California's population, now at 35 million, is projected to
reach 45.8 million by 2020;</LD>
<LD>   * Southern California just suffered through the driest year on
record in some places. In Northern California, two straight
below-normal years could presage a multiyear drought;</LD>
<TE>   * A "water bond" on the November ballot contains absolutely no
money dedicated to development of water storage facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Does that make sense?</TE>
<TE>   At a time when California faces pressing water needs,
special-interest groups have put together Proposition 50 to provide
taxpayer money to acquire private land.</TE>
<TE>   Though described in your ballot pamphlet as the "Water Quality,
Supply and Safe Drinking Water Projects; Coastal Wetlands Purchase
and Protection" initiative, Proposition 50 devotes less than a third
of its $3.4 billion to water supplies. The water-safety portion of
the bond makes up less than 1% of the total.</TE>
<TE>   So, if the special interests aren't that interested in enhancing
or protecting your water supply, what do they want?</TE>
<TE>   They want you to think you're voting for more water.</TE>
<TE>   They want you to let them control more California land than they
already do.</TE>
<TE>   And they want you to foot the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of addressing the need to supply water to California's
people, Proposition 50 provides government subsidies for large,
corporate environmentalism. The Nature Conservancy, the biggest-money
environmental group in the country, is a key supporter of Proposition
50; its lobbyists helped write it.</TE>
<TE>   The Nature Conservancy takes in $732 million in annual revenue and
pays its top executive more than $210,000. Yet it wants you to help
it buy more California land by voting for Proposition 50.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that the government already owns half of the land in
California and could devote its resources to improving habitat on
land it already owns.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that privately owned, productive and well-managed
farmland provides excellent habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that removing land from private ownership removes it
from the tax rolls, which ultimately inflates your property tax bill.</TE>
<TE>   Government agencies have embarked on a quiet but relentless plan
to absorb hundreds of thousands of additional acres of private land,
and Proposition 50 helps them do so at your expense.</TE>
<TE>   But farmers don't want to be bought out or pushed out by the
aggressive land-buying program that Proposition 50 would support.</TE>
<TE>   California's growing population needs the crops that we produce
here more efficiently than anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   Our growing population will also require additional water to
sustain it. California water supplies are stretched to their limit,
and we face the prospect of crushing water shortages in our next
multiyear drought.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Proposition 50 fails to address that problem
adequately.</TE>
<TE>   Water is a precious commodity. We need to use it efficiently and
save more in storage during wet years so we have it available for the
drought that we know is inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Your vote is precious, too. You should not waste it on a
Trojan-horse measure that claims to provide water but hides an
insidious land grab.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, urge your legislators and the governor to produce water
policies that make sense for California's environment and its people.</TE>

<HD>Getty Villa a Gem for Us All</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You'd think someone was trying to shoehorn a toxic waste dump amid
the swaying eucalyptus trees and ranch homes of the Pacific
Palisades. That's how unhappy many neighbors are with plans to
upgrade the old Getty villa on Pacific Coast Highway. Years of
negotiation between residents and Getty officials have deteriorated
into bitter court battles. Meanwhile, the former Getty museum site
has remained shuttered, and, until last week's court ruling, the only
clear victors were the lawyers.</LD>
<LD>   What does the Getty want to do to its villa? Plans unveiled years
ago would showcase the museum's extraordinary Greek and Roman
antiquities by improving display space and adding a small outdoor
theater where visitors could watch classical dramas. Add to this more
restrooms, office space, parking and traffic improvements.</LD>
<LD>   The plan addresses the neighborhood's valid concerns about noise
and congestion -- the actors onstage will not wear microphones, and
performances must stay below certain decibel levels. These
concessions won over some homeowners, but others would be just as
happy to see the villa, which housed the museum's entire collection
until the Brentwood Getty Center opened in 1997, stay boarded up
forever. There will still be too much traffic, they insist, too much
noise, and besides, a museum/theater doesn't belong in a residential
neighborhood.</LD>
<TE>   Really? What about the Huntington Library in San Marino? Other
local institutions also peacefully coexist with nearby residents --
for example, the L.A. County Museum of Art holds outdoor jazz
concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, two years ago unhappy Palisades neighbors persuaded a
trial judge to halt work at the villa on the grounds that the L.A.
City Council had improperly approved the Getty's plans. On Monday, an
appeals court wisely reversed that decision, holding that the city
had acted within its authority.</TE>
<TE>   This dispute should end there, not with another appeal to the
California Supreme Court. The Getty is a cultural treasure that all
of Los Angeles should be able to enjoy.</TE>

<HD>A Life Among the Factoids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's a piece of trivia: Americans love trivia. It's everywhere --
TV, newspapers, magazines, everyday conversations. Trivia is
irresistible. It can mean nothing. When was the fork first used in
America? (1630.) But trivia is entertaining. Who invented the sports
bra? (Hinda Miller and Lisa Zobian-Lindahl.)</LD>
<LD>   Trivia, sometimes called a factoid to provide minor intellectual
heft, might prove useful in chats or meetings. (You know, this is the
first World Series of wild-card teams.) Trivia is like Cliffs Notes
for conversations. Trivia suits a TV society and the 21st century.
You can sound informed about something without really knowing
anything.</LD>
<LD>   Who knows more about trivia than anyone, and how old is he? Caught
you. He's Joseph Nathan Kane. And he just died at 103. The son of a
New York fur importer, Kane had a fascination with facts, annoying an
entire generation of teachers with seemingly unanswerable questions.
Who was the shortest president? (James Madison at 5-foot-4.) Kane
understood Americans' fascination with trivia. So Kane spent most of
a century collecting trivia for his books and our libraries. Without
him we might not know that Chester Greenwood invented earmuffs,
Alexander Douglas patented the bustle and Amelia Bloomer was the
first woman to wear guess what? (Bloomers.)</LD>
<TE>   Kane's trivia work could be funny -- first American to hug a queen
of England (Alice Frazier, 1991); first to be struck by a meteorite
(Elizabeth Hodges, 1954, bruised). It could be intriguing -- first
notable American cross-dresser (Edward Hyde, 1702). It could be
historical -- the initial patent on sandpaper (Isaac Fischer Jr.,
1834); first president in a helicopter (Eisenhower, 1957). Or it
could be athletic -- first American team sport (not baseball, but
lacrosse). Trivia can be curious. (Marvin Stone invented drinking
straws in 1886.)</TE>
<TE>   Trivia can be importantly corrective -- Henry Ford didn't invent
the car (Charles Duryea did), Isaac Singer didn't invent the sewing
machine (Walter Hunt did), and Gustave Whitehead flew a plane two
years before Orville Wright. Trivia can be useful: Next time a lawyer
acts arrogant, ask who was the first disbarred American attorney
(Thomas Lechford, 1639, jury tampering). Trivia can also be
satisfying -- when you read the next Nov. 5 newspaper election poll,
recall that the first was published in 1824 and predicted Andrew
Jackson's election. (John Quincy Adams won.)</TE>
<TE>   Kane spent a cloistered life in New York City writing and
researching all this and more. How many children did he have? (None,
he never married.) But he is survived by 52 books and millions of
facts to feed American curiosity for years. You won't believe what
else Benjamin Franklin invented. Collecting trivia in our society, it
turns out, is no trivial pursuit. (Water skis.)</TE>

<HD>LAUSD Clarification on Measure K</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am compelled to respond to the misinformation contained in Susan
Chin-Ramirez's Oct. 21 letter questioning The Times' endorsement of
Measure K.</LD>
<LD>   The Local District F office is part of a converted warehouse that
is also home to the district's information technology division,
testing unit and the 1,600-student East Los Angeles Skills Center.
The warehouse was not painted three times, but once, using three
colors. We could fund painting for only two sides of the building.
The building hasn't been painted in over 15 years.</LD>
<LD>   The upgrade she questions was the paving of a dirt parking lot,
which was unusable in inclement weather. No Proposition BB money was
used to fund the painting or the paving, but BB has enabled us to
complete numerous projects, including the painting of Sierra Vista
Elementary School, Huntington Drive Elementary School and Multnomah
Elementary School, which are also seen on Chin-Ramirez's way to work.</LD>
<TE>   Measure K has implications that far outweigh the partial painting
of an office with three windows. It means the construction of
critically needed new schools, thereby taking thousands of students
off buses, and further modernization projects to upgrade older
schools. The bond oversight committee will ensure that projects and
funds are handled correctly and ethically. Please don't throw out the
bond with the bathwater!</TE>

<LD>Kudos to John Balzar for "Copyrights and Wrong Copying" (Commentary,
Oct. 23). He's right that perpetual copyrights have to go, while the
incentive to create is encouraged by the opportunity to receive
compensation for one's work. He might have added that the "Internet
fundamentalists" ought to think about the connection between
copyrights and patents. Inventors will stop inventing if they cannot
get patents, just as novelists and screenwriters will stop writing
without copyright protection. In time, the U.S. economy would grind
to a halt and take the Internet down with it. And the cancer drug
that won't be discovered might have saved their lives.</LD>

<LD>After reading "Last of 3 Wild Condor Chicks Is Found Dead" (Oct. 23),
remembering the other condors that have died from various causes and
thinking about what could have been done with $35 million, a question
came to my mind. Has it ever occurred to anyone, especially the
tree-hugger conservationists, that perhaps Mother Nature really does
know best?</LD>

<HD>Time for Downsizing at Los Angeles City Hall</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re Hollywood secession: As a 16-year resident and property owner in
Hollywood, I have been continually disappointed by the service, or
lack of service, from the city. Two short examples: Several years ago
a hillside collapsed into the roadway, partially blocking the route.
I called multiple times for assistance, my neighbor called, and after
several weeks of no response we shoveled out the mess ourselves.</LD>
<LD>   Recently, I called for "dead animal pickup" to remove a large dead
skunk in the road. I bagged the animal and put it on the side of the
road; after one week, no response, no pickup, nothing. I disposed of
the corpse myself.</LD>
<LD>   Is it reasonable to leave a rotting dead body in the street? Is
that the great service Mayor James Hahn alludes to? A smaller city is
more governable and more responsive to citizen needs. It's time to
downsize and lay off the deadwood at L.A. City Hall.</LD>

<TE>   Ron Thomson of Cheviot Hills gave his opinion (letter, Oct. 20) as
to how rapidly street repairs are made by the wonderful, bureaucratic
but incompetent Bureau of Street Services. "It gets fixed in a day or
so," he wrote. Well, not here in the harbor area.</TE>
<TE>   The northeast corner of Western Avenue and 25th Street has had
broken asphalt near the curb face for over two years. During that
time I have e-mailed the problem in several times with no results.
The phone maze is impossible to maneuver, so I gave up with that form
of communication.</TE>
<TE>   In my last attempt to get it fixed I visited Councilwoman Janice
Hahn's office in San Pedro and gave the exact location and
description of the problem to her aide. That was three months ago.
The owner of the gas station adjacent has also made numerous attempts
to get it fixed with the same result: nothing. The spot is still
broken, collects water and now a nice green carpet of (very slippery)
algae and other plant life growing there.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe if the spot were in Cheviot Hills it would be fixed by now.
But it's in San Pedro, and I must admit, maybe it's asking too much
to get a street here repaired in two years. Secession certainly
appeals to me.</TE>

<TE>   Being a Valley resident since birth -- and that does go back
several decades -- I was intrigued by the TV ad proposing the concern
that if one voted for secession one would be taking a big gamble on
taxes going up, the DWP fees going up, etc. Yet I did not hear that
if we voted against secession there is a promise that these fees
would be guaranteed not to rise. And according to my bills,
everything keeps going up and nothing has come down. I feel it's a
gamble not to vote for secession.</TE>

<HD>Sniper Suspect Caught With a 'Killing Machine'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the suspect apprehended in Maryland (Oct. 25) is indeed the sniper
that killed so many in the Washington area, we are looking at two
domestic terrorists who served in the 1991 Gulf War -- including
Timothy McVeigh. If one were to add up the number of persons killed
in the Oklahoma City bombing and this latest sniper rampage, it is
not too much of a leap to see that the death toll to U.S. citizens as
a result of the Gulf War rises dramatically. Do we really want to go
into another war, one that raises the threat of foreign and domestic
terrorism to such an extreme level?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In his Oct. 19 letter, Andrew Peart asserts that blaming the
National Rifle Assn. for making guns available to the Washington-area
sniper is ridiculous. I beg to differ. The gun used by the killer is
a high-powered military-style rifle using .223-caliber cop-killer,
armor-piercing bullets with a high-powered scope that enables a
killer or a not-so-sporting "sports person" to kill from an obscenely
great distance. The NRA has successfully fought against the banning
of this hardware. There is no room for such efficient killing
machines in a supposedly civilized society.</TE>

<TE>   California Puts Chill on Business Climate</TE>
<TE>   I am taking very strong exception to your Oct. 19 editorial,
"Blackouts Leave Black Eye," on the change in California's business
climate. You imply that the major reason for the rating and ranking
reduction in attractiveness issued by a third party is the
electric/energy crisis of 2001. There are other reasons for the
change. Allow me to provide some perspective, having had the
opportunity to consult to many small and mid-size businesses in
Southern California since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The first is continued high business taxes, particularly in the
nation's second-largest city, Los Angeles. The second is
out-of-control workers' compensation rates. The third is the
enactment of SB 1661, the paid Family Leave Act, which will kill job
creation in the years ahead, leaving this state with a permanently
high unemployment rate. The fourth is the continuing dismal
performance of the public education system, the primary source of the
state's workforce.</TE>

<TE>   Trashing the Law</TE>
<TE>   The recent arrests of 14 suspects for defrauding the state's
recycling redemption system illustrates the absurdity of a program
that is a de facto beverage tax (Oct. 23). How many of us actually
redeem the 2.5 to 5 cents for our bottles and cans? We don't object
to this insidious little number because it's so small, and we don't
redeem it because it's not worth our effort. This, presumably, is by
design. Is it doing what it purports; i.e., to encourage recycling?
Not for the vast majority of Californians. The fraud simply
illustrates what a joke the California redemption value is.</TE>

<TE>   Animal Sadism</TE>
<TE>   Whoa! Talk about bad choices! Your gruesome photo of a hanged
monkey ("Frustrated S.F. Goes Ape Over Rally Monkey," Oct. 24) sends
a frightening message to the impressionable young fans. Toy or no
toy, it looks like a tortured, murdered animal and should not be
glorified. Now, I'm not bashing the column; what happened happened,
and the tale (tail?) was well told, complete with SPCA comments. But
as we therapists have seen all too often, animal sadism is often a
precursor to later horrific antisocial acts.</TE>

<LD>Whoa! Talk about bad choices! Your gruesome photo of a hanged monkey
("Frustrated S.F. Goes Ape Over Rally Monkey," Oct. 24) sends a
frightening message to the impressionable young fans. Toy or no toy,
it looks like a tortured, murdered animal and should not be
glorified. Now, I'm not bashing the column; what happened happened,
and the tale (tail?) was well told, complete with SPCA comments. But
as we therapists have seen all too often, animal sadism is often a
precursor to later horrific antisocial acts.</LD>

<HD>Sniper Suspect Caught With a 'Killing Machine'</HD>

<LD>If the suspect apprehended in Maryland (Oct. 25) is indeed the sniper
that killed so many in the Washington area, we are looking at two
domestic terrorists who served in the 1991 Gulf War -- including
Timothy McVeigh. If one were to add up the number of persons killed
in the Oklahoma City bombing and this latest sniper rampage, it is
not too much of a leap to see that the death toll to U.S. citizens as
a result of the Gulf War rises dramatically. Do we really want to go
into another war, one that raises the threat of foreign and domestic
terrorism to such an extreme level?</LD>

<TE>   In his Oct. 19 letter, Andrew Peart asserts that blaming the
National Rifle Assn. for making guns available to the Washington-area
sniper is ridiculous. I beg to differ. The gun used by the killer is
a high-powered military-style rifle using .223-caliber cop-killer,
armor-piercing bullets with a high-powered scope that enables a
killer or a not-so-sporting "sports person" to kill from an obscenely
great distance. The NRA has successfully fought against the banning
of this hardware. There is no room for such efficient killing
machines in a supposedly civilized society.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am taking very strong exception to your Oct. 19 editorial,
"Blackouts Leave Black Eye," on the change in California's business
climate. You imply that the major reason for the rating and ranking
reduction in attractiveness issued by a third party is the
electric/energy crisis of 2001. There are other reasons for the
change. Allow me to provide some perspective, having had the
opportunity to consult to many small and mid-size businesses in
Southern California since 1995.</LD>
<LD>   The first is continued high business taxes, particularly in the
nation's second-largest city, Los Angeles. The second is
out-of-control workers' compensation rates. The third is the
enactment of SB 1661, the paid Family Leave Act, which will kill job
creation in the years ahead, leaving this state with a permanently
high unemployment rate. The fourth is the continuing dismal
performance of the public education system, the primary source of the
state's workforce.</LD>

<LD>The recent arrests of 14 suspects for defrauding the state's
recycling redemption system illustrates the absurdity of a program
that is a de facto beverage tax (Oct. 23). How many of us actually
redeem the 2.5 to 5 cents for our bottles and cans? We don't object
to this insidious little number because it's so small, and we don't
redeem it because it's not worth our effort. This, presumably, is by
design. Is it doing what it purports; i.e., to encourage recycling?
Not for the vast majority of Californians. The fraud simply
illustrates what a joke the California redemption value is.</LD>

<LD>Re "Father's Modest Dream Leads to Tragic Journey" (Oct. 23), on
illegal immigrants using coyotes: I can sympathize with the families
who have lost relatives in the tragic manner described, but this
should not result in making the lot easier here for people who have
arrived by breaking the laws of this country. It is not fair for
people who are trying to immigrate legally.</LD>
<LD>   The Times, it seems, is more interested in getting the business
and support of our large Latino population than it is in trying to
demonstrate balanced reporting. No nation, no matter how large and
wealthy, can indefinitely support the tide of illegal immigration
from poorer nations on the present scale without having to face
serious social, economic and cultural problems in the future.</LD>

<TE>   Re "The Plight of 'Illegal Children,' " Commentary, Oct. 21:</TE>
<TE>   Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo wants the U.S. to grant amnesty to
thousands of children based on her assessment that their plight is
the fault of everything except the stupidity, corruption,
shortsightedness and inefficiency of the countries from which they
come. The solution to the problems of these children lies with
changing these countries and not with rewarding illegal entry into
this country, which will simply foster more illegal immigration.</TE>

mothers in America must have neither shame nor honor to be thus
involved in illegal immigration. They should pay huge fines.</TE>

<LD>Iraq is consumed ... by a bizarre brand of election fever as it
prepares to reelect President Saddam Hussein.... Party officials have
chosen the Whitney Houston song "I Will Always Love You" as the
campaign theme tune.--The Times of London, October 10, 2002</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   To: Kim Jong Il</LD>
<TE>   From: First Foreign Minister Kang Sok Joo</TE>
<TE>   Re: Campaign theme song</TE>
<TE>   At your direction, I announced to the world earlier this month
that North Korea has "a nuclear weapons program and more." I would
strongly urge now, Honored Leader, that we devote all our energies to
realizing that "more."</TE>
<TE>   I speak, of course, of our theme song selection program. With the
recent success of Saddam Hussein's campaign song, "I Will Always Love
You," this program becomes an urgent priority. If Saddam can reach
his election goal of 100% of the vote, imagine what a well-chosen
theme song could do for you, who are even more lovable and telegenic.</TE>
<TE>   I know, Dear Leader, that you favor something decisive, something
that, as you so aptly put it, will "let the tortoise know it should
not take on the dragon." "Give Peace a Chance" is all wrong. But so
is the Eagles' "Take It to the Limit." We must blend humility and
strength. The Carpenters' "We've Only Just Begun" would have been a
perfect choice had not the Ayatollah Khamenei recently chosen it for
his next campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Still, you have many choices.</TE>
<TE>   Sugary, big-hearted pop can certainly help our image in the West.
Imagine our May Day stadium filled with the Great Proletariat Masses,
lifting their voices in unison to Peter Cetera's "You're the
Inspiration" or Bryan Adams' "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You." As
you once said, "If the country was glorious, the song's voice would
be high."</TE>
<TE>   You can't underestimate the impact of the power ballad. Nazareth's
"Love Hurts" fits with our campaign theme of "The Heroes of the
People Demand Sacrifice." Such a song could drive the People to ever
greater sacrifice for our Glorious Socialist Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Some of your advisors suggest that goth music or an industrial
dance remix would be the proper choice, to honor the peasants and
workers. Let me remind you that these advisors are among your most
marginal and emotionally troubled. The people, who labored long under
the feudal yoke, know your words: "Great ideology creates great
times."</TE>
<TE>   A caution: Just as a good theme song can boost the chances of even
the most unopposed candidate, the wrong song can give ammunition to
cultural enemies. Idi Amin got some bad advice when he picked
"Tainted Love" for his comeback campaign. Blame disco daughter Marija
for Slobodan Milosevic's ill-fated "Last Dance." And what was Nicolae
Ceausescu thinking with "I Eat Cannibals"? Let's avoid songs with
obvious double messages, like Tears for Fears' "Everybody Wants to
Rule the World."</TE>
<TE>   Your father, President for Life Kim Il Sung, had his signature
song. But "My Way" is not your way. You need something contemporary,
something now, something that expresses, in a single word, the
world's view of you. It can only be Michael Jackson's "Invincible."</TE>
<TE>   Soon I will tell the world: We have a campaign theme song -- and
more! Remember, if Saddam can get 100% of the vote, we can get 101%.
(How? See my memo about restarting the Japanese Heroes of the
Glorious Revolution voluntary expatriation program.)</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Can a New Yorker help an Angelo navigate the maze of local home
service providers?</LD>
<LD>   Elizabeth Franklin thinks so, having taken on the challenge with
her latest Franklin Report, a Zagat-like guide for home improvement
services.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, the former investment banker launched her first
guide for New York after having experienced firsthand the difficulty
of finding the right people to renovate her family's Manhattan
residence. Last year, Franklin and her staff did another for Chicago.</LD>
<TE>   The new Franklin Report, Los Angeles, is a purple, 362-page
paperback directory of high-end home services ranging from architects
to window washers. It provides an overview of each entry based on
interviews with clients and other research, and rates the providers
based on four categories: quality, cost, value and recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   A few entries have symbols of an open folder instead of numeral
ratings because the Franklin staff, according to the book's
introduction, "did not feel we had enough information to issue a
rating, but heard things about the firm."</TE>

<HD>Windsor Square: Mayberry with mansions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Often confused with Hancock Park to the west, the older, less-known
Windsor Square has stately mansions as big as 10,000 square feet,
manicured lawns and leafy tree-lined streets. The area, between
Hollywood and Koreatown, was developed in 1910 to resemble the
English countryside. Drawing card</LD>
<LD>   About five miles from downtown Los Angeles, Windsor Square is an
island in an otherwise urban corridor. It's near Dodger Stadium,
Staples Center and the Music Center, and even closer to the Hollywood
Bowl and the Greek Theater. People who discover the area by accident
are pleasantly surprised by the neighborhood's Mayberry-esque
Larchmont Boulevard, where locals run errands while bumping into
friends and neighbors at the barber shop, the hardware store or any
of the many sidewalk cafes.</LD>
<LD>   Wow factor</LD>
<TE>   Besides the beauty of the varied architecture -- English Brick
Tudor, Mediterranean, Colonial, Craftsman and Spanish -- the wide
streets are lined with a mix of mature trees including California
sycamores, Canary Island date palms, deodar cedars, magnolias and the
dramatic Mexican fan palm that soars to more than 90 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Insider's view</TE>
<TE>   Those who buy in Windsor Square typically stay put, some families
for two or three generations. And with restaurants along nearby La
Brea Avenue and Beverly Boulevard and The Grove now nearby, Windsor
Square residents may never have to travel to the Westside again.</TE>
<TE>   Good news, bad news</TE>
<TE>   More young families are taking up residence in the area, but
demand has pushed the price of homes up to nearly on par with the
Westside.</TE>
<TE>   Hot spots</TE>
<TE>   Current demand is for homes north of 3rd Street and south of
Beverly and near 1st Street, the so-called "pedestrian freeway,"
according to Janet Loveland, a longtime resident and real estate
agent with Coldwell Banker. Here children ride bikes, mothers push
strollers and couples walk dogs along meandering 1st Street to
Larchmont Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Houses are smaller in this pocket, 3,500 to 5,000 square feet, and
are priced between $650,000 and $1,850,000.</TE>
<TE>   Report card</TE>
<TE>   While 3rd Street Elementary School consistently does extremely
well in standardized testing, most locals use it only as a backup
choice, preferring instead to send their children to a mix of private
schools, a track most stay on through high school.</TE>
<TE>   On the market</TE>
<TE>   The area has 1,100 single-family residences, and inventory is
almost always low. Only 13 houses are on the market, ranging from
$715,000 to $5.4 million. While the upper end of the market (over $2
million) has slowed, real estate agents report demand is greatest for
homes in the $800,000 to $1.5-million price range.</TE>

<LD>The Culbertson House, designed in 1911 by Charles and Henry Greene
and one of the last homes that the brothers worked on together, has
come on the market.</LD>
<LD>   A departure from the Greenes' earlier bungalows, the Culbertson
House is Euro-Asian in style with its roof of porcelain tiles glazed
in green and dashes of burnt red. But the U-shaped house also
reflects the California Mission influence while maintaining its Arts
and Crafts details.</LD>
<LD>   The house is listed in the Historic American Buildings Survey and
is on the national Register of Historic Places.</LD>
<TE>   About this house: It was built for the three maiden sisters of
James Culbertson, a wealthy lumberman and a benefactor to Throop
Polytechnic Institute, which later became Caltech. The sisters were
Cordelia A., Kate and Margaret Culbertson.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of maintaining the house and its then-extensive gardens
wound up being more than the sisters could afford, so they sold the
house and its furnishings in 1917. A year later, the new owner asked
the Greenes to change a basement billiard room into a ballroom. The
land drops down from the street into a canyon so that the front wing
of the house is at street level, but there is still room under the
back wing for the ballroom, complete with a stage.</TE>
<TE>   The house was once on several acres, but the land was subdivided
over time, starting in the late 1940s. The house also has been
updated through the years. In 1994, the kitchen was redesigned by
Randell Makinson, an expert on Greene and Greene, and in 2000, the
house was re-roofed, using a polyglass underlay with original tiles
placed over it. More recently, a master suite was created.</TE>
<TE>   The young couple who have owned the home since 1998 plan to
relocate due to a job transfer.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $3.75 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: The house has seven bedrooms and six bathrooms in 8,559
square feet. The lot is 30,060 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The home also has a workshop; basement catering kitchen,
in addition to the redesigned gourmet kitchen; a laundry room, three
zones of air conditioning, radiant and gravity heat systems; a
detached garage; and an extensive garden. The grounds are fenced and
gated.</TE>

<HD>Acting 'mayor' sells home in Beverly Hills</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Woods, due to play former New York City Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani in a cable TV movie, has sold his Beverly Hills-area home
for slightly more than $5 million.</LD>
<LD>   The house has been on and off the market since 1999, when it was
first listed at just under $9 million.</LD>
<LD>   The two-bedroom, nearly 5,000-square-foot house has hardwood and
stone floors and wood paneling. On nearly an acre, the grounds have
meandering lawns, gardens, pools and city views.</LD>
<TE>   There is also a media room, a study and a second-story master
suite with a sitting area, walk-in closets and a terrace.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, 53, sold to spend more time on the East Coast, real estate
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The property was once owned by violinist Jascha Heifetz. Woods had
the home redesigned and rebuilt in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The Emmy-winning actor ('"My Name Is Bill W," 1988-89 and
"Promise," 1986-87) had a full scholarship to MIT, where he majored
in political science. He first drew widespread attention when he
played a cop killer in "The Onion Field" (1979).</TE>
<TE>   He starred in the HBO films "Citizen Cohn" (1992) and "Indictment:
The McMartin Trial" (1995) and played H.R. Haldeman in the movie
"Nixon" (1995). He also co-starred in "Ghosts of Mississippi" (1996)
and "The General's Daughter" (1999). He replaced Marlon Brando in a
cameo role as a priest performing an exorcism in "Scary Movie 2"
(2001).</TE>
<TE>   The Giuliani movie is due to appear on the USA Network later this
year or in early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   New direction will take actor closer to studios</TE>
<TE>   Peter Berg, who played Dr. William "Billy" Kronk in the TV series
"Chicago Hope" (1995-99) and had a guest-starring role in two
episodes of the ABC espionage drama "Alias," has listed his Venice
home at $895,000.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to move closer to the studios where he is directing the
untitled action-adventure film previously known as "Helldorado,"
featuring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Berg's one-bedroom loft is in a four-unit, three-story building a
few steps from the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The loft, built in 2001 and designed by architect Steven Ehrlich,
has a mezzanine den overlooking a living area, a glass wall opening
to a terrace, a steel-clad fireplace and a roof deck with an ocean
view. There is a garage with direct access to the unit, which also
has a laundry and a storage room.</TE>
<TE>   Besides acting and directing, Berg, 40, writes and produces. He
was the creator of the TV series "Wonderland" (1999-2000), set in a
mental hospital modeled after Bellevue in New York, and he wrote and
directed the movie "Very Bad Things" (1998), starring Christian
Slater.</TE>
<TE>   Jack V. Hoffmann of Venice Properties has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher is relieved to be with family</TE>
<TE>   Paul Shuey, relief pitcher for the L.A. Dodgers, and his wife,
Julie, have purchased a home in Manhattan Beach for $695,000.</TE>
<TE>   The three-bedroom, 1,900-square-foot home is behind gates.</TE>
<TE>   The relief pitcher, 31, was traded by the Cleveland Indians in
July. He received $500,000 from the Indians to waive his no-trade
clause.</TE>
<TE>   Known as a reliable setup man, Shuey had a disappointing 9.35
earned-run average in his first 11 appearances with the Dodgers, but
after that, the right-hander did not allow a run in five games.</TE>
<TE>   He has attributed his improved performance to his family now
living with him in the L.A. area.</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Cohen-Edwards of Shorewood Realtors, Manhattan Beach, had
the listing.</TE>
<TE>   'Smallville' creator gets a bigger space</TE>
<TE>   Al Gough, co-creator and executive producer of the Warner Bros. TV
series "Smallville" and a co-producer of the Jackie Chan movies
"Shanghai Noon" (1998) and "Shanghai Noon II" (2000), and his wife,
entertainment attorney Beth Corets, have purchased a Hancock Park
home for close to its asking price of slightly more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The four-bedroom, 2,600-square-foot house, built in 1923, had been
owned by the same family since 1940. The buyers plan to refurbish the
Country English-style house.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, they will continue to live in their nearby home,
which they purchased in 1999 from actress Fran Drescher, who starred
in the CBS sitcom "The Nanny" (1993-99).</TE>
<TE>   That house has a garden with a wraparound deck. Gough and Corets
updated the kitchen, adding a skylight. Also built in 1923, the
Spanish-style house has period tile in the kitchen and two bathrooms.
The three-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot house is expected to go on the
market in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Gough and Miles Millar have been co-producers and writers for a
number of movies and TV shows.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Hutchins of Coldwell Banker, Hancock Park, had the listing on
the home that the couple just purchased.</TE>
<TE>   Retiring from the ranch life</TE>
<TE>   Robert Daley, producer of such Clint Eastwood movies as "Play
Misty for Me" (1971) and "Dirty Harry" (1971) as well as such TV
shows as "My Favorite Martian" and "The Untouchables," and his wife,
Valerie, have put their five-acre ranch, behind gates, on the market
at $849,000.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch is in Agua Dulce, which is between Santa Clarita and
Palmdale. The producer, who retired in the mid-1990s, and his wife
plan to move to Ventura County and then to Kauai within the next two
years.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch has a five-bedroom, three-bathroom main house. The house
was built in 1983, when the Daleys purchased it. It has oak entry
floors and a master suite with a spa tub, steam shower and dry sauna.
There is an art studio in a building behind the house.</TE>
<TE>   An oak-paneled library in the house is capable of storing 4,000
volumes. Until June, it housed one of the finest collections in the
country of first editions by Mark Twain, Charles Dickens and other
authors. Daley, still a top collector of such Twain items as the
writer's personal thesaurus, sold his collection of first editions.</TE>
<TE>   In the '60s, Daley was head of production at Desilu Studios,
reporting to Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball. In 1970, he joined Clint
Eastwood as a producer of many Eastwood films.</TE>
<TE>   Daley eventually went independent and produced such movies as
"Stick" (1985), with Burt Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Rodgers and John Barker of the Entertainment Division of
Pinnacle Estate Properties in Northridge have the listing.</TE>

<HD>Can security deposit go up with the rent?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Postema</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: When I moved into my rent-controlled Los Angeles apartment
two years ago, I paid a security deposit equal to one month's rent.</LD>
<LD>   Recently I got a notice that the rent and security deposit both
were increasing by 2%. Is this OK under rent control?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: This is permitted under Los Angeles city rent control.
Your landlord can raise the security deposit with the same notice, at
the same time and by the same amount when he raises the rent under
the annual rent increase provision of the law.</LD>
<TE>   Although the allowable rent and security deposit increase has been
3% for the last several years, your landlord apparently elected not
to raise your rent last year and only to raise it by 2% this year.
According to the law, the landlord cannot raise your rent again for
another year.</TE>
<TE>   Several options on a tenant switch</TE>
<TE>   Question: I own a duplex in Playa del Rey. Two of the tenants who
were roommates apparently moved out of their unit and their friend
moved in. Is this an illegal transfer?</TE>
<TE>   If the tenant can be removed, where do I get the paperwork and how
do I go about getting rid of the tenant without going through the
courts and using an attorney?</TE>
<TE>   I have demanded one month's security deposit, a month's rent and
an additional security deposit for the dog. She has not responded and
the old tenants will not communicate with me.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Assuming that you have a lease or rental agreement
limiting the tenancy to the two named tenants who preceded this new
one, this is an illegal transfer of the tenancy. Since the new
occupant is not actually a tenant, you will have to evict the former
tenants to get rid of the new one.</TE>
<TE>   Forms for rentals are available at most stationery stores. You can
serve a "three-day pay rent or quit" notice on the previous tenants.</TE>
<TE>   If they, or she, pay the rent, you will be creating a tenancy with
the new occupant by accepting this money.</TE>
<TE>   It is probably better to serve the former tenants with a three-day
notice to perform covenant or quit (abide by the terms of the lease
or rental agreement that limits the tenancy to the two people named
on it).</TE>
<TE>   If the occupant doesn't move out after three days (not counting
the day that you serve the notice), you may proceed with an eviction
of all three parties.</TE>
<TE>   There is no way to evict tenants without going to court. And
although you may be able to evict the tenants without an attorney
(acting as your own attorney), I wouldn't recommend it. It is a
fairly complex procedure that usually takes about two months.</TE>
<TE>   If you lose on a technicality (not uncommon without a lawyer), you
must start all over again.</TE>
<TE>   I assume that you will accept the new tenant if she pays the rent
and deposits that you are requesting. If she pays them, you will have
created a tenancy with her and will subsequently be unable to evict
her without cause.</TE>
<TE>   Lease choices come with costs</TE>
<TE>   Question: I live in an apartment building in Los Angeles that was
built in 1989. In a letter, the landlord has given us three options
when the lease is up. We can either sign a one-year lease with a 5.5%
rent increase, a six-month lease with an 11.5% rent increase or a
month-to-month agreement with a 15.5% rent increase. Can he do that?
I thought rent increases in Los Angeles were limited to 3%.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Because your building is defined as new construction under
L.A. rent law (Certificate of Occupancy first issued after Oct. 31,
1979), it is exempt from rent control. The landlord can do that.</TE>

<HD>Second homes gaining ground as investments</HD>
<DH>From the mountains to the desert, stock-wary investors are
putting their nest-egg money into Southland vacation properties</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Allison B. Cohen</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glenn and Kristine Quirk once had difficulty scraping together enough
for a down payment on one home. But in just two years, the Burbank
couple have practically become land barons, having recently closed
escrow on their fifth vacation property in Big Bear.</LD>
<LD>   Glenn, 40, a golf course superintendent, started with the idea of
forming an investment club with friends to analyze and invest in
stocks and bonds. But the group didn't get off the ground until its
members changed their focus to real estate.</LD>
<LD>   "That's our whole strategy," said Kristine, 32, a senior marketing
manager with Union Bank, "to not have to invest in the stock market."</LD>
<TE>   Like the Quirks, others also are investing in second homes in the
Southern California mountains and desert.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of money that was going into the stock market is now going
into real estate," said Christopher Cagan, director of research and
analysis at First American Real Estate Solutions of Anaheim. "There's
a lot more of an interest in investors moving away from a piece of
paper and into hard assets. People want something they can live in."</TE>
<TE>   According to DataQuick Information Services, a La Jolla-based real
estate research firm, the median price for a vacation home in
Southern California this summer was $198,000, up 21.6% in July from
July a year ago. Compare that to the stock market indexes that have
plunged this year in the wake of a number of corporate scandals: the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index down 23.12%, year to date; the Dow Jones
industrial average, down 17.01%; and the Nasdaq composite index, down
33.41%.</TE>
<TE>   Add to the mix the lowest interest rates this generation has seen
and a strong primary real estate market nationwide and you've got a
second-home market that many say appears to be unstoppable.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now there is no other investment out there like real
estate," said John Karevoll, a DataQuick analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Are the Quirks and their friends worried about the so-called
housing bubble bursting? Right now, they are just enjoying the ride.
But Kristine Quirk said she knows the Southern California market can
be fickle, although she's optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "If [the market] does burst," she said, "I know it will bounce
back again, even higher."</TE>
<TE>   So far, their plans have paid off. Last month, the group's first
Big Bear property -- a 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath
residence purchased two years ago for $90,000 -- was re-appraised at
$145,000, a 61% appreciation rate.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden," Kristine said, "there was enough equity to buy
more."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, the group made down payments on three more Big Bear
area properties ranging from $75,000 to $94,500, which they rent out
year-round, except for one, which they hold for personal use during
the summer. Kristine and Glenn even decided to branch out on their
own and buy a fifth property for $89,000 with Kristine's mother and
two sisters.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very optimistic about Big Bear," Kristine said. "We think
it's a gold mine."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the Southern California vacation home market, according to
analysts, is being driven by baby boomers who are not only looking
for an investment but also hope to reconnect, or "cocoon," with
family.</TE>
<TE>   Among those planning for retirement, many from Northern California
and the Pacific Northwest are looking at desert properties. But more
Southern Californians are choosing the mountains for second homes.</TE>
<TE>   "People are just not willing to fly after 9/11," said Mike Dolan,
owner of Prudential Properties of Big Bear and a real estate agent
for 23 years. Instead, he said, Big Bear buyers are looking for quick
and safe weekend getaways.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a quality-of-life issue," he said. "Instead of talking
about a stock portfolio at a cocktail party, [they] can enjoy their
investment instead."</TE>
<TE>   One such buyer is 64-year-old Patrick Morris, a Superior Court
judge from San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   Morris and his wife, Sally, 62, recently closed on a $194,000,
1,800-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath house in Running Springs,
about 15 miles from Big Bear and minutes from Lake Arrowhead. The
Morrises, who have owned other vacation property in the Mojave
Desert, had been looking for another property closer to home to enjoy
with their children and grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "The stock market is bad," said the Morris' daughter, Katie
Willis, 36, "but this is both an emotional and financial investment
for my dad."</TE>
<TE>   Already, family members have nicknamed their new vacation home
"The Treehouse" because of its lofty location in the pines and
180-degree view.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this piece of property will stay in our family for many
years to come, long past my and my wife's time," Morris said. "It
will be a special unifying location for our family."</TE>
<TE>   Other recent buyers are just beginning their own family traditions
with vacation homes.</TE>
<TE>   Poor stock performance, low interest rates and the birth of a baby
helped 30-year-old Bob Anderson of Cypress decide the timing was
right to buy a $182,000 second home in Big Bear.</TE>
<TE>   "With interest rates where they are, we decided to pull the
trigger.... [My wife and I] both have stocks, but we don't look at
them right now."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, "I always wanted a place to hang out, have a cup
of coffee and look at the snow ... and we wanted to have a place for
our child to enjoy as well."</TE>
<TE>   Although Bob and his wife, Pam, 31, said they paid more for their
vacation home than they did for their house in Cypress in 1996, they
still feel they got a good deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I know in general the market has been high," Bob said. "But I
think over the long term it will [continue to] go up."</TE>
<TE>   Although much of the second-home market activity has been in the
mountains of Southern California, residences in the Palm Springs-Palm
Desert area have also done well this year, especially after last
year's poor sales. According to the California Assn. of Realtors,
sales in the desert were down 14.9% in 2001 compared with 2000, while
the median price there was up 20.7%.</TE>
<TE>   "We are noticing a lot of activity," said Scott Gerrie, president
of the California Desert Assn. of Realtors. "This [past] summer was
busier than most."</TE>
<TE>   According to the association, compared with last year, the median
price for a residence in Palm Springs was up 25.75% to $210,000 as of
August and up 15.95% in Palm Desert. Sales of single-family houses
and condos, analysts say, were also up in double digits across the
Coachella Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "[Buying real estate] sounded like a much better deal than getting
2% on my CDs," said Victor Slayman, 80, of Porterville, Calif., who
along with wife, Lucille, 78, recently closed on a $255,000 home in
Palm Desert. The Slaymans had visited the desert from their Northern
California home for 10 years and were looking not only for a solid
investment but also for a place to relax.</TE>
<TE>   Although they plan to rent out the property during the winter
months, for now, Victor said, they just want to enjoy their desert
home themselves, right next to the green on the 14th hole.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great spot to just watch the golfers," Victor said.</TE>
<TE>   Another recent buyer is Woodland Hills resident Stan Jolley, who
bought his first vacation home in Rancho Mirage 22 years ago. Jolley,
76, recently closed on two more properties in Rancho Mirage; one for
$299,000 for his children and grandchildren to enjoy and the other a
$208,000 fixer he remodeled for a fast resale.</TE>
<TE>   "We stole that one. It was really good timing," he said. "We've
already put it back on the market for $285,000."</TE>
<TE>   With the desert's low inventory, which has spurred multiple offers
above the listing prices in some cases, even the mountain-loving
Quirks are considering investing there.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to put all of our eggs in one basket," Kristine
said. "But I think it might be time to diversify a bit. Recently,
we've started thinking about the desert."</TE>

<LD>Mortgage lending, a bright spot in the economy, is expected to slide
to $1.57 trillion in 2003 from this year's anticipated record of
$2.03 trillion, the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America said in its
annual forecast last week. Higher interest rates {mdash} the 30-year
fixed rate is expected to rise to between 6.8% and 7% by the end of
2003 {mdash} will end the refinancing boom and price some home buyers
out of the market, MBA chief economist Doug Duncan said.
Refinancing's share of mortgage activity is expected to drop to 36%
from 58% this year, he said.</LD>

<BD>From Times wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Budget Project is the latest group to send up red
flares about the state's worsening affordable housing shortage. The
nonprofit's new report, "Locked Out 2002," estimates California is
short 651,000 affordable rental units for families earning less than
$18,000 a year.</LD>
<LD>   The number reflects a steep downturn the last decade in
construction of apartments, condominiums and townhouses.As shortages
push up home prices, the state's 58% homeownership rate is the
nation's fourth worst, the study shows, behind Hawaii, New York and
the District of Columbia.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1995, owners of 24,000 "affordable" housing units have
converted to market-rate rents.</LD>

<HD>BCS Poll: Fuzzy Math, Fuzzier Logic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sally Jenkins</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The BCS issued its first computer tabulations of the college football
season, and once again, my eyelids are fluttering, and I have the
beginning of a facial tic. The BCS has carefully counted every factor
except one: any shred of real logic. Somewhere in all of those
numbers and all of that money, a $26 million championship bowl payout
to be exact, the BCS lost sight of something. The real purpose of
math is to be right.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe we should be glad the BCS is at least half right, given its
track record of wrongness in recent years. The BCS did manage to
place Miami and Oklahoma as the top two teams in the country, which
is where they belong. The problem is, they're in the wrong order.
This is perfectly in keeping with the BCS history of botch jobs,
which gave us last year's timeless classic of a championship game, in
which Nebraska went down by 23 points.</LD>
<LD>   According to the BCS, Oklahoma is the No.1 team in the nation,
despite the fact that its starting quarterback is hurt. Meanwhile,
defending champion Miami, which has won 28 straight games and gone
unbeaten for a year and a half, is No.2 and in imminent danger of
dropping in the ratings, even if it remains undefeated. This is due
to the Pythagorean delicacy and complexity of the BCS formula,
according to which, you can beat a team Saturday, and fall in the
rankings Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The BCS formula includes five different components: losses,
average ranking in the two national polls, average ranking in seven
other computer ratings, strength of schedule rating (divided by 25),
and BCS "quality wins."</TE>
<TE>   Despite these exquisitely fine calibrations, the BCS never makes
as much sense as the AP, or the Coaches polls, relying as they do on
live organisms, actual witnesses of football games. As opposed to
chip-driven electromagnetic devices. According to the AP and the
Coaches, the Hurricanes are No.1.</TE>
<TE>   You can bet BCS representatives are rooting heavily for Florida
State to beat Notre Dame this weekend, because otherwise the unbeaten
Fighting Irish are in perfect position to ascend from No. 3 in the
rankings and displace Miami. Which would thereby screw up any chance
of a clear national championship game in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   The answer to this mess is to dump the math. Pythagoras was great,
but he also refused to eat beans. Among the more laughable components
of the BCS formula is the fact that it actually counts the New York
Times rankings among its many factors. Now, anyone who follows
college football knows that the Times poll is a dose of instant
comedy. The joke is how chronically, stubbornly wrong the paper of
record can be, because it, like the BCS, relies on oblique computer
tabulations. A couple of weeks ago it actually ranked USC No. 2,
despite the fact that had already been beaten by Kansas State. The
paper has taken to writing wry apologetic commentaries to accompany
each week's poll.</TE>
<TE>   Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese, who is also the BCS
coordinator, has always favored a human committee to decide the bowl
lineups. Tranghese spent five years as a member (and former chairman)
of the NCAA basketball selection committee, which used the polls only
as guidelines in making the postseason tournament brackets. "My
experience in basketball was that when you get to the end of the
season and you're trying to discern between a team with an RPI of 42
and one with an RPI of 48, you shouldn't base that decision on just a
number," he says. "You need qualified people to look at the data and
insert some common sense."</TE>
<TE>   Last April at a BCS meeting, Tranghese proposed diminishing the
importance of the formula in favor of a committee of actual people.
That way the formula would simply be a suggestion, rather than the
final determining factor. He got nowhere -- mainly because the seven
major conference reps are loath to let independent outsiders wrest
control from them.</TE>
<TE>   So we are stuck with a formula that often results in mockeries. In
response, I've decided to start my own poll. The SJ poll. The SJ Poll
is a complex personal formula, hand tabulated by me. Better yet, call
it an index.</TE>
<TE>   The Jenkins Personal Index.</TE>
<TE>   The JP Index is based on the following criteria: How often the
school's name appears in my newspaper, one tenth of a percent. Color
scheme of uniform, one tenth. Whether a school's mascot is a nice
animal or not, six tenths. Mascot animals with eyes in the front of
their heads receive bonus points, as opposed to mascot animals with
eyes on the sides of their heads.</TE>
<TE>   Based on those sophisticated factors, and depending on whether or
not I had a good, hot lunch, here is my own Top 10, henceforth known
as the SJ Poll/ JP Index:</TE>
<TE>   1. Army. Name me a school with a tougher strength of schedule
factor. The Cadets have to face Afghanistan, North Korea, and Iraq.
Plus, they have to play all of their big games on the road.</TE>
<TE>   2. Oklahoma. In addition to having the best head coach and the
best defense in the country, they play in a place that legitimately
produces golf ball sized hail.</TE>
<TE>   3. The University of Chicago. They dropped football years ago. I
just miss them.</TE>
<TE>   3. The Cincinnati Bengals. At 0-6, they should be downgraded to an
NCAA team, and sent to the Humanitarian Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   4. Bowling Green. Unbeaten, and people still think they're a
bowling school.</TE>
<TE>   5. Penn State. Because my friend Ann went to school there.</TE>
<TE>   6. Texas Christian University. It will make my father so happy.</TE>
<TE>   7. The Bethesda Chevy Chase, Md., High School perennial state
champion field hockey team, because as the BCS has proved, an index
wouldn't be an index if it didn't have a howler in it.</TE>
<TE>   8. Nebraska. Because I have sympathy for the world's downtrodden.</TE>
<TE>   9.William 10.Mary.</TE>

<HD>The Post-Pro Bo</HD>
<DH>Jackson's not spending his time on the what ifs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUBURN, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Bo Jackson responds without hesitation, as if he's heard the question
hundreds of times -- which he has.</LD>
<LD>   Do you ever wonder how good you could have been?</LD>
<LD>   No, he says.</LD>
<TE>   "I did what I did, then I got out of it," said Jackson, not even
looking up from the muted TV in his hotel suite. "I wasn't in it to
be a Hall of Famer. I used it as a stepping stone.</TE>
<TE>   "My employers used me to make their team better, I used them to
make my life better down the road."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who turns 40 on Nov. 30, is now pretty far down that
road, yet he remains one of the biggest what-could-have-been athletes
in sports history, a two-sport star whose face was ubiquitous in "Bo
Knows" Nike commercials in the late 1980s and '90s.</TE>
<TE>   He won a Heisman Trophy at Auburn in 1985 and turned in
highlight-reel plays in major league baseball and the NFL before a
hip injury ended his two-sport days six years later.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson still has the chiseled frame, the intense mien and the
unwavering desire for privacy that were trademarks of his playing
days.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he's devoting those skills to his Chicago-based company,
N'genuity, which deals in such things as food processing and
distribution.</TE>
<TE>   He makes public appearances promoting his company -- he has a deal
with Mrs. Smith's to sell his sweet potato and pumpkin pies using his
mother's recipes -- travels constantly, and engages in his passions
for hunting, fishing and golfing.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got everything going good for me," said Jackson, who lives
with his physician wife, Linda, and their three children in a Chicago
suburb.</TE>
<TE>   They have a hunting lodge with 700 acres stocked for rabbit and
deer hunting. He raises pheasants and ducks on the property and can
indulge in his hobbies without anybody pestering him about sports.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always kept a low-key, even before I got out of sports,"
said Jackson "That's just how I chose to live my life.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just me. I don't do anything just to do it. I don't do
something just to get my name in the paper or let people know what
I'm doing. I'd rather people not know what I'm doing outside of
sports.</TE>
<TE>   "But if it will benefit my company, I'll think about doing it."</TE>
<TE>   There's plenty to talk about in his athletic exploits.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's football career with the Los Angeles Raiders ended with
an injury in January 1991. He eventually had hip replacement surgery,
but still came back for part of two baseball seasons with the White
Sox and the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   The abbreviated two-sport career posted statistics that are
ordinary: He batted .250 with 141 homers for the Angels, Royals and
White Sox in parts of eight seasons. He rushed for 2,782 yards and 16
touchdowns in 38 games in four seasons as a part-time player for the
Raiders, averaging 5.4 yards per carry from 1987 to 1990.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't hint at the eye-popping exploits that made him
extraordinary:</TE>
<TE>   * He is the only player in NFL history to rush for two touchdowns
of 90-plus yards. Plus, he bowled over Seattle's Brian Bosworth for a
memorable TD in a 1988 Monday night game.</TE>
<TE>   * He led off the 1989 All-Star game with a homer, earning MVP
honors, and homered in three straight at bats at New York on July 15,
1990, before separating his shoulder while diving for a line drive.</TE>
<TE>   * He made a leaping grab at the left-center field wall in Kansas
City, bounced off, pivoted and threw a runner out at first base
without taking a step.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just the best athlete I've ever seen," former Royal teammate
George Brett once said.</TE>
<TE>   Raider teammate Howie Long echoed that, proclaiming him "the most
awesome physical specimen I have ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is also the only player selected to the All-Star games in
the NFL and major league baseball, although the hip injury kept him
out of the Pro Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, his pro career was not as long as it could have
been and should have been, and we'll never know just how great he
was," said Auburn athletic director David Housel, who was sports
information director during Jackson's playing days.</TE>
<TE>   "But when you look at great athletes and great people, Bo Jackson
has to be near the top of the list."</TE>
<TE>   Housel believes Jackson was always preparing for life after
sports, even in college.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Bo always had a vision about him," Housel said. "Because
he always had that vision, he always had a peace about him. Bo
Jackson always knew where he was going, and he knew there was a life
after athletics."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson made a comeback with the Royals and White Sox -- homering
in his first at bat for the Sox in 1993 -- but never regained the
powerful stroke that led to a 32-homer, 105-RBI season for the Royals
in 1989 in just 135 games.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson says his artificial hip doesn't preclude him from doing
anything -- except maybe outrun defensive backs. As in his playing
days, he exercises regularly but doesn't lift weights.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does he follow sports.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't watch no football, no baseball, no basketball," Jackson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said there's a reason why life after sports was easier for
him than many former athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of your athletes ... don't know but one thing, and that's
what they're doing. Playing ball," said Jackson, who has a degree in
family and child development from Auburn. "Whether it's football,
basketball or baseball. It's the same thing in hockey. They're
one-dimensional people.</TE>
<TE>   "Once that's over, they don't know what to do after that."</TE>
<TE>   Ask Bo. He knows.</TE>

<HD>Time to Decide Who's Best, East or West?</HD>
<DH>This Saturday the USOC will choose between New York and San
Francisco when it selects the U.S. candidate for host city of 2012
Summer Olympics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.</DL>
<LD>It's the Big Apple vs. the City by the Bay, East Coast against West
Coast, sentiment or scenic beauty.</LD>
<LD>   Choosing between New York and San Francisco as the U.S. candidate
for the 2012 Summer Olympics is sure to be tough for the U.S. Olympic
Committee's board of directors.</LD>
<LD>   "I think that both cities have put forth convincing cases, and
it's going to be difficult to choose between them," said Anita
DeFrantz, International Olympic Committee member from the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   The vote will take place Saturday during the USOC's annual meeting
in Colorado Springs. The winner will face up to a dozen international
cities -- Toronto, Rome, Paris, Moscow and Rio de Janeiro are among
the possibilities -- when the IOC makes its selection in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Both cities will get a final chance to prove their cases this
weekend, when each group will make an hourlong presentation to the
USOC's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   New York's infrastructure and cultural diversity are strengths,
and it could be the sentimental favorite after the Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco offers ideal weather conditions, scenic vistas and a
wide range of world-class venues already in place.</TE>
<TE>   Both cities have international appeal as tourist destinations and
are U.S. icons, with the Statue of Liberty in New York as a symbol of
freedom and San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge as the country's
gateway to the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're fortunate to have two excellent cities to chose
from, and I think either one will be a good representative
internationally," said Bill Hybl, another IOC member from the U.S.
"New York has a reputation around the world as being a very dynamic
city and San Francisco is a very beautiful city."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy New York Mayor Dan Doctoroff, founder of NYC2012, said New
York's biggest asset could be the chance to provide a powerful
Olympic story. He said New York would compare to the selections of
Beijing, in the world's most populated country, and Athens, site of
the first Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   "Those two are no-brainers because of the compelling stories they
tell, but I think New York could have the greatest Olympic story of
all," Doctoroff said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think about what draws people to the Olympic movement,
it's something that New York lives every day. And if you look at it
from an athlete perspective, I think New Yorkers will tell you this
is the most competitive place in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "As the Frank Sinatra song goes, 'If I can make it here, I can
make anywhere.' "</TE>
<TE>   The keys to San Francisco's bid are its venues and weather.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the venues are clustered in four areas, which organizers
call the "Ring of Gold," and 80% are already in place. The clusters
are in San Francisco, Oakland/Berkeley, Stanford and San Jose/Santa
Clara.</TE>
<TE>   Canoeing and rowing would be held outside Sacramento. Cycling
would be north in the wine country and equestrian would be held at
Fort Ord near Monterey. The rest of the venues -- 92% -- would be
within 32 miles of the Olympic Village.</TE>
<TE>   And the weather should be perfect, with an average heat index of
76 and almost no chance of rain at the time the games would be held.</TE>
<TE>   "We've involved athletes in every step of the process, and we
wanted to make sure we had the best possible conditions for the
athletes to excel," said Anne Cribbs, a former Olympian and head of
the Bay Area Sports Organizing Committee. "And we really feel like
our bid creates the best competitive conditions."</TE>
<TE>   New York will spend about $900 million of its $2.4-billion budget
to upgrade and build new facilities.</TE>
<TE>   That will include three new arenas, a 25-acre park in Brooklyn for
beach volleyball and archery, and the conversion of two polluted
lakes at Flushing Meadow into rowing and canoeing courses.</TE>
<TE>   They would surround the Olympic Village in West Queens, which
would sit on a waterfront site just across the Hudson River from the
United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   New York's infrastructure also should boost to its bid.</TE>
<TE>   With subways, buses and ferries, the city is designed to move
millions of people every day. NYC2012 officials have used that system
to their advantage, creating a transportation "X" around the Olympic
Village that will keep from clogging the city.</TE>
<TE>   The plan will use existing rail lines that run from the
Meadowlands in New Jersey to Flushing Meadow to move athletes and
officials east and west. The ferries that run between Manhattan and
Long Island would be used to move people north and south, and buses
would be used for local transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Bid officials have broken the transportation needs down to
30-minute intervals and in such detail that they already know 830
buses, 92 ferries and 13 trains would be needed on Aug. 3 -- the
busiest day of the 2012 Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that one of the biggest concerns about New York hosting
the Olympics is getting people around," Doctoroff said. "But with our
plan, the athletes will almost never have to travel on the city's
streets."</TE>
<TE>   Transportation would be more of an issue in San Francisco with the
venues so far apart.</TE>

<LD>It's nice that Patrick McCabe has a lot of rich and famous friends,
but if I were an alum, I wouldn't be encouraged by what I read ("The
Education of Patrick McCabe," by Andy Meisler, Oct. 6). It looks like
McCabe is interested in turning Santa Monica's Newbridge School into
a low-rent former military school, such as his own alma mater.</LD>
<LD>   I would suggest that McCabe pick up a copy of "Summerhill School"
or read a few books about Montessori education because his
alternative education experience is certainly limited. In a
progressive school there is nothing wrong with addressing teachers
and administrators by their first names. And "Friends of Pat" being
the main attendees of Newbridge School's First Annual Fund-Raising
Dinner and Auction (with a slight nod to "slightly
uncomfortable-looking teachers")--well, take a hint: This isn't a
good long-term plan. Remarks about parents' ability to afford
Newbridge should never have been made within earshot of a reporter.
It comes across as insulting, especially for those on financial aid.</LD>

<TE>   Meisler's article unwittingly accounts for the disparity in test
scores between private and public schools when McCabe argues that
students with special behavioral or learning problems don't belong at
Newbridge. When public school teachers and administrators are
responsible for educating these students, they have to devote a
disproportionate amount of time and energy to nonacademic matters. As
a result, student performance suffers. There's nothing intrinsically
superior about private schools. They simply have the freedom to admit
and expel at will. Those students who remain are taught in small
classes that are the envy of public school teachers.</TE>

<TE>   How could Thomas Hudnut, the headmaster of Harvard-Westlake
School, be so disconnected from the reality of public education that
he would assert that teaching is a "job you get right out of college
... something you could do when you were 23"? Could he really have
counseled a potential teacher that the choice to enter the teaching
profession at the age of 43 would be "the stupidest thing" he's ever
heard?</TE>
<TE>   Now 46, I left my comfortable management-level position (and
salary) at age 43 to pursue a teaching credential and teach
elementary school in the Los Angeles Unified School District. I have
used every ounce of management and life experience accrued in my
professional and personal history to great advantage during this
transition. Teaching has been the most challenging, exhausting and
gratifying professional experience in my life so far.</TE>

<LD>My hero this week is "Fairy Glimmer" (a.k.a. Sheryl Cancellieri) and
the parents who send their children to her Fairy School ("Who Needs
Soccer Practice When You Can Dance on a Toadstool?" by Leslee
Komaiko, Metropolis, Oct. 6). While early childhood teachers have
largely resigned themselves to carrying out our societal mandate to
hurry children along in their journey to adulthood, and many parents
participate in this "adultification" by fast-tracking their kids into
all manner of pseudo-mature pursuits, Cancellieri leads children into
fancy and wonder. That's no trifle.</LD>
<LD>   Neuro-development experts know that the "downward thrust" of
academic curricula into kindergarten and preschool thwarts rather
than accelerates our children's development. Why don't schools and
most parents recognize this? The statistics on America's troubled
youth are staggering. If youngsters were offered more pixie dust (and
other staples of imagination), and less of our cold, adult intellect,
maybe we could turn that tragic tide.</LD>

<DH>The Italian Version of Shortbread, Crostata Biscotti Are
Always in Demand</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID DOWNIE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My mother made the mistake of taking my teenage sister, two brothers
and me to an afternoon concert at a popular theater in Rome, where we
had moved in the mid-'60s. I can't remember what the orchestra
played, but it must have been good. When the music stopped, the
audience jumped to its feet shouting "Bis! Bis! Bis!" I, too, shouted
"bis," without knowing what it meant. I was the youngest of four and
suspended somewhere between California kid English and Roman kid
Italian. On the way home one of us asked what we'd been yelling.</LD>
<LD>   "Encore," she said, dodging Fiat 500s and Vespas as she herded us,
her American kids, around fountains and columns on our way home. "Bis
is for music and opera when you want to say encore. "Bis is for
biscotti," said one of my brothers as we squeezed into our building's
ancient elevator. "Biscotti, biscotti," we chanted and clapped. My
mother shook her head, then relented. From the fridge she pulled a
dishcloth enfolding a ball of buttery dough left over from
yesterday's crostata. Crostata was our favorite jam tart--a thick,
crusty shortbread platform smeared with sour cherry preserves.</LD>
<TE>   "Wash your hands," she said. "Instead of playing with clay today
you're going to make crostata biscotti." She put my sister to work
grating the zest off a lemon, and ordered me to shell and crush
almonds. My brothers went out for oranges. These my mother peeled,
cooking the peels with sugar and water until they glistened. We took
turns around a big mixing bowl, squeezing the lemon zest, crushed
almonds and candied orange peel into the cold dough. After pinching
off a walnut-sized ball of dough, my mother rolled it into a perfect
round cookie. "You make the rest." My sister drifted to the window,
peering down at the nattily dressed young men and their motor
scooters, while my brothers and I transformed the dough into snakes,
dragons, hearts and Vespas. The cookies had barely cooled before we'd
gobbled them.</TE>
<TE>   Years later I learned the origin of biscotti. For centuries,
Italians baked bread rounds, cooled them and then baked them again to
eliminate humidity. No damp meant there was no mold, and that, in
turn, meant the twice-cooked biscuits would last forever. Sea
biscuits had long been the staple of miserable long-haul mariners. A
clever baker added butter and sugar to them and, bingo, sweet
biscotti were born.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays crostata biscotti are whipped up for their own merits.
Romans fashion them into fanciful shapes, including, I suppose,
hearts and Vespas. At some point I gave up on those shapes, and
snakes and dragons, too. But I still can't help playing with silky
biscotti dough, forming it into the initials of dinner guests, for
instance, a disarming surprise guaranteed to elicit childlike smiles
from St. Peter's to San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Biscotti di crostata</TE>
<TE>   Makes about 2 dozen biscotti</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, chilled</TE>
<TE>   1  1/2 cups all-purpose flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup granulated sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup slivered almonds</TE>
<TE>   zest of 1 organic lemon, minced</TE>
<TE>   2 heaping tablespoons diced candied orange peel</TE>
<TE>   (candied lemon peel may be substituted if orange is unavailable)</TE>
<TE>   Cut butter into small pieces. Pour flour into a mound in a large
mixing bowl and make a well in the center with your fingers. Add the
butter, sugar, eggs yolks, almonds, lemon zest and candied orange
peel. Stir gently until thoroughly mixed, 2-3 minutes. Pinch and
squeeze the dough, pushing away and gathering it back until it cleans
the sides of the bowl and has the consistency of modeling clay, 5-7
minutes. Roll the dough into a compact ball, put it in a clean bowl
covered with a dishcloth and chill for one hour. Grease two 10
1/2-by-15  1/2- inch cookie trays. Put chilled dough on generously
floured work surface and pinch it into pecan-sized balls. Roll them
out with your palm or a rolling pin to flatten them into cookies
about 3-4 inches long, 1-inch wide and  1/4 inch thick. Use a knife
or small spatula to straighten the sides of the cookies. Transfer the
cookies to the trays with a spatula and bake in a 350 degree oven for
about 20 minutes until golden brown and firm. Cookies will get
crisper as they cool.</TE>

<LD>" 'The Munsters' continue to haunt me," says Kevin Burns, proud
guardian of a huge memorabilia collection devoted to the
black-and-white '60s sitcom about a family of horror-movie ghoul
look-alikes. "It's important to get back to being a child every once
in a while."</LD>
<LD>   Burns had an otherwise typical boyhood in Niskayuna, N.Y., but got
hooked on "The Munsters" at age 9, watching the Thursday night CBS
program religiously and obsessively drawing characters from the show.
"My parents didn't know what to do with me." Burns' mother suggested
that he send some drawings to Fred Gwynne, also an artist, who played
Herman Munster, your typical family dad and Frankenstein monster.
"Within a week of Christmas, in our mailbox is a studio fan card, and
on the back it says, 'Dear Kevin, Thanks for the drawings, Fred
Gwynne.' I slept with this postcard for weeks. When Herman Munster is
acknowledging your existence, that is it."</LD>
<TE>   "The Munsters," a goofball takeoff on the era's bland "Donna
Reed"-style family sitcoms, debuted in 1964. Produced by Universal
subsidiary Kayro-Vue, the so-dumb-you-love-it show starred Gwynne
(previously of "Car 54, Where Are You?") as dad Herman; Yvonne
DeCarlo as vampire siren mom Lily; Al Lewis as Transylvanian
patriarch Grandpa; and Butch Patrick as werewolf son Eddie. The cast
also included Beverley Owen, succeeded by Pat Priest, as Lily's
"normal" blond college coed niece Marilyn, pitied by the others as
the plain Jane of the family. The Munsters lived in a cobweb-infested
mansion at 1313 Mockingbird Lane, drove George Barris-designed
monster hot rods and couldn't understand why people screamed and ran
when they saw the family coming. Like "The Addams Family," its ABC
rival, "The Munsters" lasted a mere two seasons but attained
immortality through reruns and fan adulation.</TE>
<TE>   For better or worse, Burns' collecting was helped by a "Munsters"
syndication publicity packet he acquired from TV station WRGB in
Schenectady, N.Y. "It had the synopsis of every show, ads, templates,
photos," he says--plus a list of licensees for Munster products.
"That list ruined my life." Burns placed an ad in Film Collectors
World and got an enormous response from sellers eager to part with
puppets, dolls and photos at closeout prices. From that early start,
his collection today numbers thousands of photos, hundreds of games
and a few precious props, including Grandpa Munster's original
electric chair, purchased by Burns for $31,500, and "The Munsters
Target Game,'' a vintage dart game that he grabbed for $27,000.</TE>
<TE>   Burns studied film at Boston University, earning a master's before
coming to Los Angeles in 1988 to work for 20th Century Fox
Television. Now 47, he heads his own production company, Prometheus
Entertainment. Burns was thrilled when A&amp;E asked him to produce
"Biography" segments on Gwynne, Lewis and DeCarlo. "People who got
phone calls from my researchers said, 'You should talk to Kevin
Burns.' ''</TE>
<TE>   It gets weird out there in Munsterland. "I've found about 20 of
us, and I'm talking hard-core, cutthroat collectors," he says. "Some
have become friends, some hate me. People bid just to make me pay. To
me it has emotional value." Indeed, though he possesses Lily's bat
necklace and two Eddie Munster costumes, dearest to his heart is that
postcard from Gwynne. "I didn't know anyone who was an artist, and he
took the time," he says. "A very insignificant connection can be
huge."</TE>

<HD>A Recipe for Change</HD>
<DH>Chefs Nancy Silverton and Mark Peel Update Their
Prairie-Style Craftsman House in Hancock Park</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA THORNBURG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twelve years ago, Los Angeles chefs Nancy Silverton and Mark Peel
were living in a loft apartment above Campanile, their La Brea Avenue
restaurant. ''We were directly over the main dining room,'' Peel
says. ''After 6 o'clock the kids had to wear socks so the customers
wouldn't be annoyed by the pitter-patter of little feet.''</LD>
<LD>   They grew out of the space, Silverton says, when she became
pregnant with their third child, Oliver. Wanting to stay close to the
restaurant, the couple began looking in nearby Hancock Park and fell
in love with a 3,200-square-foot 1916 prairie-style Craftsman with a
spacious layout, four upstairs bedrooms and beautiful mahogany
woodwork, ''not to mention the four-minute commute to the
restaurant,'' Silverton says.</LD>
<LD>   Furthermore, the house didn't need major work. ''There were things
we wanted to change, but it was completely livable,'' Silverton says.
They began to slowly renovate, removing the upstairs wall-to-wall
carpeting and refinishing the quartersawn oak floors downstairs. They
stripped the mahogany wood trim and wainscot as well as the
Batchelder tile fireplace, which had all been painted over.</LD>
<TE>   After several years of nesting, the couple decided to renovate
further and called in a friend, Brentwood interior designer Lori
Erenberg. ''They wanted to retile the kitchen,'' Erenberg recalls.
''It had this large multicolored floral paper on the walls and small
white tiles on the splash and counter from an earlier, not-so-good
1970s renovation. It just didn't fit with the house.''</TE>
<TE>   Celadon-hued tiles now cover the counters; a new coat of
butter-colored paint brightens the walls. A pine table from
Silverton's college days stands next to a recent local purchase,
forming a central island to add work space. Instead of installing
commercial appliances, the couple opted for a Dacor stove top and
KitchenAid oven and refrigerator. ''I have this theory that the more
expensive the kitchen is, the less people cook,'' Peel says. ''I've
seen some pretty fancy kitchens--when you look in the refrigerator
there's nothing but frozen pizza and Snapple. I've never felt
inconvenienced by not having a commercial stove at home.''</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the house was freshened up with simple decorative
changes such as paint, wallpaper, tile and fabric. The couple's
collection of colorful Clarice Cliff English pottery from the '30s
inspired the new color palette of wheat, olive and burnt orange that
runs throughout the house. A woven wallpaper in the family room and
simple matchstick blinds on the windows add texture and warmth.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of period Craftsman furnishings, Erenberg took her cue
from the Danish-style modern dining room table and chairs that
Silverton had grown up with. Danish modern pieces fill the adjacent
family room where their three children like to hang out with friends,
the family and, occasionally, pet snake Knuckles. ''Craftsman
furniture is so massive and somber, with all the dark woodwork I felt
it would weigh down the house,'' Erenberg says. ''I wanted to make
the house airier and a bit more hip.''</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the couple transformed their narrow patio into a large
outdoor room for entertaining. Los Angeles landscape designer Barry
Sattels altered the rear patio, enlarging it by 15 feet. A trellis
planted with hanging wisteria shades the outdoor room, casting
dappled shadows onto the new acid color-washed concrete floor.
Sattels scored the concrete and selected five hues--from wheat and
amber to verdigris--a muted version of the home's interior palette.
''The acid wash reacts with the concrete and becomes a part of it as
opposed to something sitting on the surface,'' the landscape designer
explains. ''It creates a mottled look and gives this wonderful
patina, as if the patio were the same age as the house.''</TE>
<TE>   The focal point of the room is undoubtedly the new hand-troweled
concrete fireplace with its mahogany mantle and ledge for sitting. A
custom-designed rotisserie and grill inside the hearth were inspired
by a set-up the couple discovered in a quaint trattoria in Tuscany.
''There's an iron grate in back that holds the wood and gives off
radiant heat for the rotisserie. As the logs burn and coals fall you
can rake them forward for the grill,'' Peel says. ''We cooked our
turkey there last Thanksgiving. It didn't take as long as in a
conventional oven.''</TE>
<TE>   When Peel and Silverton entertain friends at home, they stick to
simple things such as steaks or sausages on the grill. ''Nothing with
a long prep time,'' Peel says. ''I hate to clean up.''</TE>

<DH>What Could Possibly Lure So Many People From a Real
Tropical Paradise to the Conjured Mirage of Las Vegas?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>Lisa Leff is a freelance writer living in Ventura. Her
last article for the magazine was about the fate of Los Angeles
County's unidentified dead.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Hotel &amp; Casino isn't what people imagine when they
think of the "new" Las Vegas. It wasn't built to resemble a pyramid,
a medieval castle or anything more architecturally ambitious than a
pair of towers that would be at home near any major airport.</LD>
<LD>   Situated on the edge of downtown, three miles northeast of the
glitzy Strip and three blocks from the city's secondary gambling
district, Glitter Gulch, the California offers little in the way of
location. It doesn't have a health spa, a Starbucks or a single
man-made water feature, not even a swimming pool. There is no
lounge--hence, no lounge acts--on the premises either, nary a
magician, showgirl or faded crooner to distract visitors from the
business of betting. If contemporary Las Vegas is a smorgasbord for
the senses, the "Cal" is strictly meat-and-potatoes, a Holiday Inn
with slot machines.</LD>
<TE>   What the California Hotel does have is a customer base of
unparalleled loyalty. Its 781 rooms are almost always occupied. The
typical guests, men and women in their late 60s, check in once every
other month and stay at least four days. Ignoring the novelty of
other venues, they eat, sleep and bet a tidy bankroll of several
hundred dollars (more than typical Vegas visitors) almost exclusively
at the Cal, where the food, casual dress code and laid-back dealers
remind them of home. These devoted patrons hail not from the Golden
State, as the hotel's name might suggest, but from Hawaii, a spot
that seems far removed from Vegas, both aesthetically and
experientially.</TE>
<TE>   But for reasons both cultural and economic, Las Vegas is the top
travel destination for Hawaiian tourists, a preference the California
Hotel's management has carefully cultivated for almost three decades.
Each year, nearly a quarter-million passengers make the five-hour
trans-Pacific flight from Honolulu to McCarran International
Airport--a number equal to one-fifth of the Aloha State's population.
More than half of them stay at the Cal or one of its two sister
hotel-casinos, the Fremont and Main Street Station, turning downtown
Las Vegas into a provisional Polynesian colony.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the surfeit of Hawaiians on holiday in this desert
oasis, thousands of Islanders have made Sin City their home during
the last decade, a period in which Hawaii's economy flagged and
Vegas' flourished. Some estimate that the Pacific Islander population
in metropolitan Las Vegas is as high as 80,000 (out of the
approximately 1.4 million residents counted during the 2000 census).
The migration has been both steady and visible enough that many
Hawaiians refer to Las Vegas as "The Ninth Island," a catchy
appellation coined by a Hawaii-born Army officer who started a
magazine for expatriate Islanders after he retired there in 1996. It
also has spawned a boom in southern Nevada hula schools, lei-making
contests and a seemingly endless array of Hawaiian food and music.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these emigres are no different from the Central Americans
who come to the United States to make better lives for their
families, or even the Okies who abandoned the Dust Bowl for uncertain
futures as farm hands in California. Yet in many ways they are even
bigger gamblers than their fellow Hawaiians who flock to Vegas as a
temporary antidote for island fever. For these children and
grandchildren of the Pearl Harbor generation, leaving home means
fleeing not some brutal war or oppressive dictatorship, but a U.S.
state that most people consider paradise.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is hard to escape, and woven among the curious
cross-cultural images is a familiar story as old as America
itself--of corporate manipulation and economic survival, of a proud
culture's desire to hold on to its heritage and its inevitable
assimilation, of tempting fantasies and cruel illusions. It's a tale
that's been told so often that it has become archetypal. Only here,
the huddled masses are wearing flip-flops.</TE>
<TE>   Mainlanders have always been fascinated with Hawaii. About once
every 20 years, a collective enthrallment with island culture
announces itself in a commercial eruption of tiki torches, ukuleles
and grass-skirted hula girls. America is, in fact, at the apex of
such a phase now, a trend evidenced by the palm tree shower curtains
and hibiscus-print bath towels Pottery Barn featured in its summer
catalog, the resurgence of backyard luaus, and the release in late
June of "Lilo &amp; Stitch," the Disney film about a Hawaiian girl who
attempts to teach an unruly alien about the meaning of o'hana, or
family.</TE>
<TE>   But in Hawaiians' love affair with Las Vegas, it's possible to see
beyond our animated images of the islands. Like the first star in the
night sky or the single dab of red paint that leaps out from a dull
landscape in a Corot painting, the contrast between lush rain forest
and harsh desert, between the innocent pleasures of paradise and the
dream of instant riches, is impossible to ignore. And, like the
tourist who dares to venture off the main drag, you can't help but be
discomfited by what you find there.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the California's casino, Islanders who have never been
anywhere on the mainland besides Las Vegas sit raptly before banks of
video poker machines with Hawaiian-themed names such as Shaka Five
Way, Diamond Head and No ka 'oi (The Very Best). Year after year,
Asian Pacific alumni of high schools on Maui and the Big Island
attend their class reunions in the hotel's O'hana and Maile banquet
rooms, their organizers having assumed that they'll get a better
turnout there than in Hawaii. Indeed, Las Vegas is such a draw for
Hawaiian tourists that one of Honolulu's oldest travel agencies often
tacks side trips to Vegas onto its escorted tours of other popular
mainland destinations. The practice results in such quirkily packaged
junkets as the "California Coast and Catalina Island Including Las
Vegas" and "Autumn New England and Las Vegas" tours.</TE>
<TE>   In return for its Hawaiian visitors' fidelity, the California
Hotel's parent company, Boyd Gaming Corp., co-sponsors a two-day Lei
Day festival on an asphalt parking lot adjacent to the hotel every
May. Lei Day, the Polynesian equivalent of May Day, is a big deal in
Hawaii. Children celebrate the occasion with elaborate school
pageants where they crown a Lei Day queen and her court, while adults
compete in lei-making contests and distribute garlands of jasmine,
ginger and orchids like valentines. Relocated to a desert climate,
however, the holiday loses something in the translation.</TE>
<TE>   This year's Lei Day Las Vegas was a fund-raiser for one of the six
hula schools that have cropped up in southern Nevada, and it took
place during one of the spring's first hot weekends. Although 59
vendors were selling everything from Aloha-print checkbook covers to
puka shell necklaces, fresh flowers were in short supply. One of the
two flower dealers on hand had flown from Oahu toting 3,000 plumeria
blossoms the night before. She spent the first day of the festival
bathing her sweetly scented wares in ice water and watching
helplessly as they turned brown anyway. The kukui nut leis that other
vendors had fashioned as a hardier alternative didn't fare much
better. By late afternoon, the nuts were cracking and popping off
their strings in the parched air, leaving the blacktop littered with
shells.</TE>
<TE>   Still, hundreds turned out for the event. Most of them weren't
California Hotel guests at all (they were in the casino, still
gambling), but transplanted Islanders who, after getting to know Las
Vegas through frequent visits, moved to the city seeking employment,
education for their children and access to a way of life they
couldn't afford back home--in short, for the same reasons that lure
immigrants from outside the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Carrying plates of kalua pig, malasada doughnuts and chili and
rice, Lei Day revelers huddled in the shade of a billboard
advertising the Main Street Station Hotel's "$11.99 T-bone Tuesdays."
After dark, Polynesian dance troupes took turns performing with bands
playing both vintage Hawaiian music and the Hawaiian-infused reggae
known as "Jawaiian" in the glow of a neon sign for Binion's Horseshoe
Hotel and Casino. The overall effect was one of extreme cognitive
dissonance.</TE>
<TE>   In both Las Vegas and Hawaii, the California Hotel is recognized
as the place "where people from paradise play ... and stay," in the
words of Boyd Gaming's advertising staff. But it's hard to say which
came first, the hotel or the tendency of Islanders to vacation in Las
Vegas. Either way, it's fair to say that the level of tourist traffic
from Hawaii to Vegas would not be nearly what it is today if the
hotel's founder, a veteran gaming operator named Sam Boyd, had been
more successful with his original plans for the property.</TE>
<TE>   When Boyd purchased the land for his first Las Vegas hotel-casino
in the early 1970s, he envisioned the venue as a mecca for gamblers
from Southern California, a segment that to this day remains Las
Vegas' largest source of visitors. Boyd signaled his intent both in
the hotel's name and in its Gold Rush-era decor. But within months of
the California Hotel's opening on New Year's Eve 1975, it became
clear that downtown didn't need another Western-themed casino,
especially one located so far off Fremont Street.</TE>
<TE>   With the Cal struggling to attract customers, Boyd decided he
needed a new niche. His choice of Hawaii wasn't arbitrary. From 1935
to 1940, he had lived in Hawaii running underground bingo parlors in
Honolulu and Hilo. (Hawaii, Utah and Tennessee are the only states
where all forms of gambling are illegal.) "He said, 'I know the
Hawaiians, and we will make the California their home away from
home,' " recalls Sam Boyd's son, Bill, who succeeded his father as
Boyd Gaming's chairman.</TE>
<TE>   The Boyds aggressively courted the Island market. They visited
travel agencies and airline booking agents based in Hawaii, and put
together an exclusive "Hawaiians only" package deal: four nights and
five days of lodging, plus three meals a day, for $9.70. The absurdly
low price tag reflected both Vegas' twisted economy and Sam Boyd's
take on his Hawaiian clientele. He figured he could afford to heavily
subsidize their trips because people raised on a sheltered tropical
island would be more likely than the average adventure-seeking
tourist to stay put in his casino once they got there. And the more
time they spent there, the more they would gamble.</TE>
<TE>   John Repetti, who started his career at the California Hotel as a
dice dealer in 1976 and today serves as its general manager, explains
Boyd's thinking this way: "If someone plays long enough, eventually
the casino will win what it is supposed to win."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Boyd died in 1992, but his philosophy of making it cheap and
easy for Hawaiians to visit Las Vegas remains at the core of the Boyd
company's strategy for promoting its three downtown casinos. The
original room-and-meals package for Hawaii residents, and anyone who
can prove they were born on the islands, now costs $110, with
Hawaiians making up 80% of the Cal's guests, up from about one-third
in the late 1970s. The Gold Rush design scheme is gone, replaced by
dealers in Aloha shirts, a stand selling Lappert's Hawaiian ice
cream, and a coffee shop that serves such traditional Hawaiian
favorites as saimin noodles, oxtail soup and mahi-mahi sandwiches. In
the gift shops, guests can buy the Honolulu newspapers, packages of
dried mango and beef jerky, and T-shirts imprinted with frogs, a
symbol of good fortune in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "Hawaiian people are big gamblers," explains Aileen Cabrol, a
65-year-old Oahu woman who is waiting for her daughter in the
California Hotel lobby, accompanied by her 84-year-old aunt and a
sister, age 70. She echoes a view expressed repeatedly among
Hawaiians in Vegas as an accepted fact, without any
self-consciousness or fear of stereotyping. Cabrol casually mentions
that her sister is carrying more than $5,000 in gambling money. "If
they can't come up with $1,000," she says, "the Hawaii people don't
bother to come."</TE>
<TE>   Some trace this propensity for gambling to everything from
gaming's outlawed status in Hawaii to the mixed-race heritage of
Asian Hawaiians. "The Japanese women love to play cards, and the men,
when they were working for plantations, there were a lot of poker
[games] going on," explains Flo Wasai, a retired 7th-grade teacher
from Oahu who was attending her husband's high school reunion at the
Cal. "The Filipinos have chicken fighting. I guess it's just that
gambling is legal here. We have to get off the rock sometime."</TE>
<TE>   Of their long allegiance to the California Hotel, several longtime
customers say they like staying somewhere where they can eat their
customary cuisine and don't have to worry about looking out of place.
"A lot of the Hawaii people are not very secure about traveling. Here
it's kind of a protected environment," Wasai says. Other repeat
visitors from Honolulu say that the hotel's package deals make it
less expensive for them to go to Las Vegas than it would be to visit
Maui or Kauai--that is, if you don't include what they spend playing
the slots.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody likes to come here because the Aloha Spirit at the
California Hotel makes you feel welcome," says Hawaii native Malia
Blume, a Las Vegas resident since 1979 who spent the spring
organizing a reunion for her far-flung family of mainlanders as well
as Hawaii residents. (Her family's last reunion five years ago also
was held at the Cal.) "It's centrally located and it's so affordable.
Plus, when you come here, at least you get the chance to make your
money back."</TE>
<TE>   But it's more than a simple dollars-and-cents equation. Boyd
Gaming has worked hard through the years to send its Hawaiian patrons
the message that they and their money matter. Every year in Honolulu,
the company hosts a huge "Mahalo" (thank you) party at the Sheraton
Waikiki, where its customers get to consume free drinks and food and
exchange pleasantries with company executives. Every other month,
80,000 households in Hawaii receive a glossy "News At The Cal"
newsletter featuring the names, photographs and hometowns of anyone
who has recently won more than $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   One measure of how well these marketing efforts have succeeded is
the membership of the hotel's "Golden Arm Club" for elite craps
players who have achieved shooting sprees of more than an hour. The
hotel established the club in honor of a late Honolulu carpenter,
Stanley Fujitake, who in 1989 held the dice at the California's
casino for three hours and six minutes, a world record that remains
unbroken. Of the club's 141 members, 108 live in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Fujitake's 76-year-old widow, Satsuao, says that although her
husband didn't make much money during his record-setting run (he was
too busy concentrating on the dice to place bets), his achievement
remains a source of pride. The Honolulu newspapers and radio stations
did stories about him, and he was treated like a minor celebrity in
Hawaii. Strangers approached him, hoping to acquire some magic from
the man with the "golden arm."</TE>
<TE>   Since her husband died two years ago, Satsuao Fujitake has kept
his memory alive--and her loneliness and grief at bay--by visiting
the California Hotel at least once a month and for every major
holiday. She typically spends 16 hours a day feeding coins into the
poker machines--she allows herself about $3,000 per trip--and the
staff treats her royally, comping her rooms and meals no matter how
long she stays.</TE>
<TE>   Being treated like a big shot is usually a new experience for the
California Hotel's past-prime nurses, hotel gardeners and retired
civil-service workers who make up its regulars. They may have grown
up on sugar and pineapple plantations, may have heard that they
didn't speak the "right" English. For them, even a calculated
marketing ploy that makes them feel special exerts a powerful pull.</TE>
<TE>   The Lei Day festival at the Cal wasn't the only Hawaiian event in
Las Vegas last May. Across town at the Palace Station Hotel, a
competing Pure Aloha festival made its debut the same weekend. The
Society of Seven, a band that has been headlining in Waikiki for more
than 30 years, was partway through a 13-week engagement at the Golden
Nugget. The following week a Hawaiian goods trade show at the
Stardust attracted the governors of both Hawaii and Nevada, while the
week after that brought a cultural retreat designed to teach young
Hawaiians about traditional food, crafts and music. Meanwhile, anyone
longing for a taste of the Islands could choose from among three
weekly Hawaiian-style buffets being offered around town.</TE>
<TE>   While Joe Chan finds those touches of home comforting, he also
wishes he had a dollar for every haole [white person] who's ever
asked him, almost indignantly, why he left Hawaii. Then he might be
able to afford to return to the island his Hong Kong-born parents
adopted 20 years ago, and where he became fluent in pidgin, graduated
from high school and college, and got married. Instead he owns a
Hawaiian goods store in a Las Vegas strip mall, where he sells
T-shirts that read: "Be a local Hawaiian and work 2 jobs in Hawaii to
support your o'hana. So no ask why we moved from Paradise."</TE>
<TE>   "They don't understand that you can't really enjoy paradise when
you are working 80 hours a week and getting home at 10 o'clock at
night, and even then you can barely make it," says the 36-year-old
Chan. "I tried to stay as long as I could."</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Chan was running his family's wholesale import
business in Honolulu. He wanted the company to grow, or, better yet,
he wanted to diversify so that his clan would have more than one
unsteady source of income. Although he holds an electrical
engineering degree from the University of Hawaii, "we aren't exactly
part of the world economy," he says. And nothing in Hawaii's stagnant
business climate assured him that he would be any more successful as
an entrepreneur. Chan decided to go stateside. He checked out
locations in California and Arizona before he settled on Las Vegas,
hoping that the city's large Hawaiian tourist base and the growing
community of "locals" throughout the West would fuel a demand for
kona coffee, heavy gold heirloom jewelry and Island music CDs.</TE>
<TE>   For all of Las Vegas' climactic differences with Hawaii, more than
one transplanted Hawaiian stresses the similarities between the two
locales--spectacular sunsets, a relaxed, resort-oriented culture and,
to the extent that Las Vegas is surrounded by barren land, isolation.
Plus, says Katherine Pohndorf, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas
hotel management professor and founder of Lei Day Las Vegas: "We can
walk through the casinos in our pareos, muumuus and rubber slippers,
and nobody blinks an eye."</TE>
<TE>   For most, moving to Vegas is a practical decision. Many already
knew of the city because they had been there so many times on
vacation. They were acquainted with others who had made the leap and
found cheap houses and good jobs. And they knew they eventually would
see friends and family from back home at the Cal.</TE>
<TE>   So in the process of executing his vision, Sam Boyd transformed
thousands of lives in ways he probably never imagined--lives like
that of Ransen Borges, who to this day isn't sure how he ended up in
Las Vegas after the collapse of his Hawaii-based promotional goods
business. "I wanted to move to Seattle, but I ended up in Las Vegas
like everyone else, even though I don't gamble," he says. His
five-person family arrived in Las Vegas on a Super Bowl Sunday, when
the temperature outside was 49 degrees. After five minutes in the dry
air, his 5-year-old daughter's nose started bleeding. When they got
to the house they were renting, the family cat took off, never to be
seen again.</TE>
<TE>   It felt like an omen, a "big-time bad omen," recalls Borges, who
was born and raised in Hawaii and whose family had lived there for at
least four generations. "The next day I said, 'You know what? We're
going home. The cat's gone. It's freezing. I cannot stand this place.
We're leaving. Today.' "</TE>
<TE>   That was "seven long years" ago, Borges says. Yet what did they
have to go back to? They had sold his business, their house and their
two cars, and either sold or given away all of their furniture. So
they stayed and bought new furniture, put the kids in school and
started looking for work. "The first hotel I walked into, they hired
me," Borges says, who signed on at Excalibur Hotel as a claims
adjuster handling liability cases. Within a year and a half, he had
an even better job, as director of risk management at the Luxor.</TE>
<TE>   The money was good and his children thrived. His in-laws and twin
brother followed them to Las Vegas. He figures that the exposure to
new places and people, and even the unpleasant sting of racial
discrimination, has been good for his kids. During their time in Las
Vegas, they've been to Morro Bay to look for jade, surfed in Southern
California, and gone to see Indian reservations and national parks in
Utah and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, though, the weight of what he has given up hits
Borges like a North Shore wave. "I remember the first time I drove
out to Lake Mead, I almost cried because I couldn't see the other
side," he says. "And when I went down to where the beach supposedly
is and all I found was a mud flat, I almost cried again."</TE>
<TE>   Borges has never been back to Hawaii, and last year took a
$50,000-a-year pay cut to become assistant to the pastor of Thy Word
Ministries, a 150-member "Island-style" church in Las Vegas founded
by a husband-and-wife team who also operate four churches in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Pastor George Kamakahi, who founded the church for which Borges
now works, says that when he was first approached about starting a
ministry in Las Vegas, "I wasn't open to it at all because I didn't
like it up here, I thought it was ugly." During the next two years,
however, Kamakahi came to believe that God wanted him to make the
journey "to reach the Polynesians," wherever they might be. So he and
his wife, along with eight other families, moved to Las Vegas two
years ago. These days, his Sunday morning services in a new shopping
center on the southern limit of the city draw about 150 people.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe that the flow of Hawaiians to Las Vegas may already
have reached its peak. No new luxury hotels have gone up on the Strip
since the Aladdin opened two years ago, and many of the construction
workers have gone home to Hawaii, where the economy is improving.
Borges has heard the news and is hoping to move his family back to
Hawaii by year's end. Some, like Phyllis Matsuda, president of the
University of Hawaii Alumni Assn.'s Las Vegas Chapter, have made
peace with their choices, maintaining that they have gotten more in
touch with Hawaiian culture now that they are so far removed from it.
She learned to play the ukulele and dance hula only after she and her
husband retired to Las Vegas 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I hear it all the time--why in the world would you want to go to
the desert? There is nothing there but gray and brown," says Matsuda.
"But little by little, you pick up on the subtle beauty of the desert
and you come to appreciate it. It's still brown and gray, but then
you start to notice the purples and oranges, too."</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as Chan, are bitter about their Las Vegas experience.
Chan's dream of becoming a regional wholesale distributor of Hawaiian
goods never got off the ground. "We saw a lot of locals here, but we
never figured out that the ones who moved here are coming with no
furniture or nothing and need to have their disposable income to
spend on something else besides Hawaiian goods," Chan says. Chan
still operates a small retail store in Las Vegas, but says he makes
most of his sales through the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Business remains strong at the Cal, though. Several years ago,
Boyd Gaming started offering daily nonstop charter flights from
Honolulu to Las Vegas. The 747s operate 99% full, since the company
can drop ticket prices whenever sales get sluggish. Says the hotel's
John Repetti: "At the end of four days, it's all going to come out in
the wash. We are not about roller coasters and health spas. We are
about playtime and treating people correctly."</TE>
<TE>   Some say Boyd Gaming won't be able to keep the place filled with
its aging Hawaiian regulars. The company, which now owns 12 casinos
in five states and is developing a $1-billion resort in Atlantic
City, seems already to have anticipated that day; it has dedicated
the parking lot where Lei Day Las Vegas has been held for the past
five years to a 7,500-seat city-owned events center that is expected
to draw a younger and more diverse crowd.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Boyd continues to put its faith in those lucky
frogs. Since December, three Hawaii residents have won
multimillion-dollar jackpots at one of the Boyd properties, two of
them within a month of each other at the Cal. News of the windfalls
was carried from the casino's marketing department to its faithful
guests via the Honolulu newspapers and radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, you don't have to look very hard to see how those
gilded fairy tales have undeniable appeal to people whose dreams are
always just out of reach. One of those who heard about the recent
winning streaks was 49-year-old Florentina Ballesteros, a native
Filipina who lives on Oahu with her disabled Hawaii-born husband and
17-year-old son. To support her family, Ballesteros works two jobs,
in a hospital cafeteria and a restaurant. A healthy income tax refund
made possible a spring visit to Las Vegas, the only place on the
mainland she and her son have ever been. (The family has come once a
year for each of the last 10 years.) As they made their way past the
rows of ringing slot machines, it looked like just another Hawaiian
clan on its way to a breakfast of Spam, undercooked eggs and rice.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I came to Las Vegas, I felt so great. And I
thought, maybe if we come, I can recycle my energy," she says. "Here,
even if you are only playing five cents, you lose your stress."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, though, she was unable to parlay her tax refund
into a windfall. After food, lodging and airfare, she had $300 left
for gambling. Within hours of the family's arrival, it was gone. Now,
the morning after, she is sinking into the black vinyl seat of a
video poker machine, weeping and remembering the co-workers who
criticized her for going to Vegas, for being too extravagant. What
right did a person of limited means have to go flying off like some
high roller?</TE>
<TE>   "I told them the reason I come here is to make myself happy, and
that's how I feel about it," she says through fresh tears. "If I
don't come here, I feel bad. I feel hopeless. Only my dreams make me
alive."</TE>
<TE>   Ballesteros' husband gently reminds his wife that they have
friends waiting in the coffee shop. Slouching by the elevator doors,
her son is getting antsy, too. She wipes her eyes and smooths her
floral-print shirt. Rising to go, she asks if she could have a spare
quarter "for luck." Taking the coin and rubbing it between her
fingers, she says she'll play it after breakfast. Maybe someone
else's good fortune might become hers.</TE>

<LD>In many ways, the influx of Hawaiians to Las Vegas and Clark County
says more about Hawaii than it does about Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Like Vegas, the 50th state has its own anomalous economy, one
driven almost exclusively by tourism and the trade of its limited
real estate. During the late 1980s, a wave of Japanese investment
helped drive up residential home prices in Hawaii by about 90%,
creating an exodus of Hawaiians who were "land rich but cash poor,"
in the words of playwright Edward Sakamoto, whose 1992 play, "Aloha,
Las Vegas," paid homage to the trend. Retirees living on modest
pensions realized that they could sell their homes for $350,000 and
purchase a brand-new one for $100,000.</LD>
<LD>   When the Japanese investment bubble burst in 1992, Hawaii plunged
into a recession that continued for the rest of the decade. Hawaii's
tourism industry took a hard hit when California, its biggest source
of visitors, saw its aerospace industry collapse. By the end of 1996,
the unemployment rate in Hawaii stood at 6.4%, compared to 4.6% on
the mainland. The 2000 census showed that for the first time, more
people--mostly the young and middle-aged--were abandoning Hawaii
rather than settling there.</LD>
<TE>   Las Vegas was in the midst of a growth spurt that began with the
opening of the Mirage hotel in 1989. There were more restaurant,
construction and retail jobs--mainstays of Hawaii's economy--than
people to fill them. When it needed employees to staff its new Las
Vegas stores, Longs Drugs recruited them directly from its chains in
Hawaii--and then set up a Hawaiian aisle in every store where they
could get tropical juices, tins of Vienna sausages and fresh poi.</TE>
<TE>   Although many of these jobs did not pay any more than comparable
ones in Hawaii, the cost of living in Las Vegas was so much lower
that people's money went a lot further. A family living on Oahu needs
an additional 27% in income to maintain a lifestyle comparable to
that of an urban family in the continental U.S. For Hawaiians in Las
Vegas, going to the grocery store, where a gallon of milk costs less
than half as much as it does back home, can be an exhilarating
experience.--Lisa Leff</TE>

<HD>Out of Hiding</HD>
<DH>Weaned on the Holocaust and Anne Frank, She Had Run From
Her Jewish Heritage. Then She Started Searching for Answers to the
Question: Who Are We?</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Susan Baskin last wrote for the magazine about breast
cancer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I was 12, my aunt screamed at me across the kitchen table:
"You're a Jew. No matter what you say, what you do, you're a Jew. And
they won't let you forget it." I remember my parents, seated across
from my aunt, saying nothing to refute her charge. This was my fate,
their silence said. I was a Jew. And I hated it.</LD>
<TE>   What happened in my parents' kitchen that night corroborated
feelings that had been spawned years earlier. Weaned on the Adolf
Eichmann war-crimes trial, the atrocities of the concentration camps
and my generation's poster child, Anne Frank, I grew up waiting for
the "knock on the door." Anne Frank's diary was the first nonpicture
book my father gave me, and like many of my contemporaries, I adopted
her as my hero. I named my first diary Kit and spent hours in my bed
at night planning where, between the walls in my house, my family and
I could hide from the Nazis. What I couldn't understand then was that
in embracing Anne Frank's life, I embraced her death, for in her
story, the two are inseparable. But in the Jewish New York of my
youth, my passion for her wasn't unusual. The mounting details of the
Holocaust were the stories grown-ups told around the kitchen table.
As a child, if you listened quietly, you were allowed to hear them,
part cautionary tales, part portents of your future. If it wasn't my
grandmother who was killed, it was her mother, or the family of our
"refugee" neighbor. Their ghosts were the silent companions of my
childhood. They came to life in my dreams. Like someone starving, I
devoured the tales of sacrifice and death, reading, watching,
listening to anything I could until the faces, bodies and the flames
became so much a part of me that they were encoded. Heeding the
lessons well, I became entangled in the paradox of feeling safe and
warm within my Jewish world, while knowing that ultimately being a
Jew meant annihilation.</TE>
<TE>   But I wanted to live. I wanted survival lessons. When none came, I
made plans of my own. I'd marry a non-Jew, I told my father. That
way, I would save my family and myself. My father shook his head. If
you were as little as one-quarter Jewish, the Nazis took you. How
would they know? They'd know. Still, I was undeterred. In the second
grade, I made my first non-Jewish friend. After playing together at
her house, I asked her mother if she would hide me. She said yes,
shaken by my request. The thrill of meeting someone with powers like
hers filled me with the possibility of salvation.</TE>
<TE>   If safety and being a Jew were an oxymoron at best, what remained
elusive was what bargain I had to strike to grant my survival. In
Hebrew school, I would be the child in class to argue with the rabbi
in favor of intermarriage. As an adolescent, I stopped wearing the
Chai around my neck, or any article that seemed remotely Jewish. In
college, I studied the Bible with an ex-nun and spent my junior year
in Jerusalem taking English literature courses. And the man I
married, though Jewish, didn't read Hebrew, worked on the High
Holidays, and cooked me my first pork chop. While I wanted to cast
off being Jewish, clearly, I didn't know how not to be. Like a snake
shedding its skin, every time I would try to slip away from it, I
would discover another sheath of Jewishness that had grown around me.</TE>
<TE>   Chazak. Chazak. Chazak. Out of learning comes strength. Three
weeks after my son was born, a women's Torah study group formed in my
neighborhood. I was searching then--for community, an avenue for
spirituality, but most of all, for answers. For the sake of my
children, I wanted to understand this people whose destiny so clearly
spelled death. I wanted to reckon with the actions of their God. And
if I don't yet have the answers, what I gained from joining the group
is the certain knowledge that my questions are not mine alone, but
reside in Jews who came before me. Realizing that my predecessors
were just as mystified by who we are pulled me within my religion,
rather than pushing me away. It led me to ask whether it is the
mystery that binds us and keeps us here, and whether it is in seeking
the key to that mystery that I, like those before me, find
self-knowledge. For in the search for meaning, my questions have
allowed me to discover myself as a Jew.</TE>
<TE>   But that is personal. My study of Judaism fed my mind and my
spirit. And though I found a way to reclaim a Jewish identity in my
personal life, I was still struck dumb in public. I could light
Sabbath candles in my home on Friday nights, but I had qualms about
the mezuza hanging outside my door. I could present my professional
self publicly, but as a Jew I wanted to stay invisible.</TE>
<TE>   Without my determining it, this threshold was challenged. After
the Passover suicide bombing in Israel that killed 29, I heard about
an anti-terrorism, pro-Israel rally at the Federal Building in
Westwood. My response surprised me. Like everyone I know, I'd been
following the escalating violence between Israel and the Palestinians
with horror and alarm. But I'd never attended a rally having to do
with Israel, or any Jewish cause. And I was ambivalent about this
one. I support Israeli withdrawal from the territories and have
reservations about the Israeli military incursions and the
Palestinian civilian casualties and destruction they were causing. I
couldn't support that. But something broader compelled me to go. It
was the crime of silence. I felt complicit in the condemnation of
Jews if I did not speak out--against terrorism, for Israel's right to
exist, but just as strongly, against the historical imperative to
target the Jews. The taunting litany of the German Jews' "It can't
happen here" trumpeted in my mind. Keeping quiet was no longer an
option.</TE>
<TE>   The rally crowd was large, spanning both sides of Wilshire
Boulevard and spilling onto the Federal Building's lawn. I stayed
back when I arrived, hesitant to join the front lines, and surveyed
the scene. What I saw was the Diaspora in front of my eyes. Iranian
Jews. Russian Jews. Israelis and Spanish-speaking Jews from South
America. Outnumbering the native-born, they stood on the curb of
Wilshire Boulevard, holding signs. Suddenly, it struck me that they
were not only protesting against terrorism and showing their support
for Israel, they were exercising their right to assembly and free
speech. Many of them had come from repressive regimes; a sense of
past persecutions was palpable. Now they were embracing a citizen's
right, previously denied. They stood together, as Americans, as Jews,
bound not only by a common faith and history, but by the knowledge
that whatever the future held, they would share the same fate as a
people. I had never felt this strength and unity around being a Jew.</TE>
<TE>   I stepped forward. The traffic was at a standstill when a South
American couple made space for me on the curb. From the number of
cars and intensity of the horns, one could almost imagine that the
whole world was behind the Jews. But at the same time, I was aware of
the possibility of violence. A car bomb. A suicide bomber. "The worst
can happen," John Updike wrote in a recent poem, "we know it from the
news." In full view of the cars, I felt too visible and had the urge
to look down, or walk away. Then the woman next to me offered me her
sign to hold. Nonplused, I stared at her. This was a request to step
beyond visibility. It was a declaration. I looked at the sign. It was
a photograph of a 15-year-old Israeli boy killed by a suicide bomber.
Maybe it was the boy's still-soft cheeks. The memory of Anne Frank's
smile. Or that the only crime these two kids committed was being
Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   I took the sign from the woman and set out on my ludicrous, but
tortured, road toward holding it aloft. First I held the sign in
front of my face. Then lower, in front of my stomach. As the cars
honked in support and their passengers took the rally in, I finally
lifted the sign and held it above my head. Something happened then.
The cautionary tales of my childhood transformed themselves. They
were not about hiding anymore. I wanted to be seen. Stronger than my
fear was the visceral mandate to cast off my cloak of invisibility
and my silence.</TE>
<TE>   Far from being frightened by what I'd done, for the first time in
my life, as a Jew, I felt emboldened. I don't know where that
defining moment will take me. But the irony hasn't escaped me that
having spent the majority of my life waiting for the Nazis, I am
relinquishing my caution at a questionable time--in light of Sept.
11, volcanic Arab rage and the rise of anti-Semitism. As I recall the
haunting last words of slain journalist Daniel Pearl, "I am a Jew. My
father is a Jew. My mother is a Jew," my aunt's long-ago warning
takes on a chilling resonance. But like all moves toward freedom,
there's no turning back. Not even if I'm still frightened.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles River's concrete-lined channels can summon bleak
images, whether it's a bystander being swept away in floodwaters on
the local news or a liquid-metal shape-shifter hunting Arnold
Schwarzenegger in "Terminator 2: Judgment Day." But the southeast Los
Angeles city of Paramount is offering a different perspective with a
rainbow of three murals painted on the river's levees during the past
three years. At Rosecrans Avenue, Somerset Boulevard and Alondra
Boulevard, riverbed graffiti has given way to painted processions of
Orcas, sharks and sea turtles frolicking along the embankment.</LD>
<LD>   The three murals are part of an ongoing revitalization effort in a
city that was declared a disaster area 20 years ago in a Department
of Housing and Urban Development study measuring crime, welfare and
other social indicators. Since the late 1980s, however, soothing
fountains and outdoor sculptures usually reserved for silver-spoon
neighborhoods have sprung up throughout the city. And white picket
fences line frontyards where chain link once stood (the city pays 75
cents on the dollar for homeowners to make the switch). "Things like
the murals are just baby steps, but when you do enough of them, it's
a huge stride toward erasing blight," says City Manager Patrick West.</LD>
<TE>   For the river project, Irvine-based artist Adel Rakhshani devised
"happy" sea creatures at the request of city officials hoping to
soften cold concrete and deter taggers. "It's like the kids know not
to abuse the nice stuff," West notes. The artist, brought on board at
the recommendation of West's stepson, a Newport Beach landscape
architect, also integrated a subtler message--he positioned the
animals swimming upstream to show that "it takes courage to go
against the current."</TE>
<TE>   Rakhshani produced one mural measuring nearly 40 feet by 350 feet
during each of the past three years. "Let's face it, the river is not
exactly beautiful," says the artist, who has also created public art
for Burbank and Santa Ana. "People don't really take care of it, but
I think we've made a very nice change."</TE>
<TE>   Long the center of a tug of war between environmentalists striving
to restore natural habitats and bureaucrats bent on preventing flood
damage, the 52-mile L.A. River (four-fifths of which is encased)
often sits untouched, its potential stifled at times by policy
gridlock and litigation. Paramount is trying to buck the trend. Along
with the murals, which cost about $60,000 and come from the city's
general fund, the city plans to expand a park that lies between two
of the three murals, which were strategically placed for maximum
beautification. "We wanted them at the three bridges that lead into
town so people can see these great big aquatic scenes when they're
coming home or going to work," West says. "When you drive through
Southeast L.A., you're going to see a lot of tough areas. Maybe the
murals will give people a little break from that, perhaps even put a
smile on their face."</TE>

<LD>The Living History Cemetery Tour may sound like an oxymoron, but $17
tickets sell out for the fall event in which earthly mortals portray
inhabitants of the Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery in West Adams.
Incorporated in 1884, the graveyard on Washington Boulevard was the
first in Southern California open to all races and religions. In
"residence" are many civic pioneers and film stars such as Hattie
McDaniel and Anna May Wong. We asked participants what they dug up.</LD>

<TE>   40, sound designer/actor, Valley Village</TE>
<TE>   Who was your character?</TE>
<TE>   Dr. George Emery Goodfellow (1855-1910). He was a Wild West doctor
in Tombstone, Ariz., coroner of Cochise County and surgeon for the
Arizona Eastern and Southern Pacific railroads. He fought in the
Spanish-American War. He was a wily visionary, a bit of a braggart.</TE>
<TE>   Do you believe in ghosts?</TE>
<TE>   I don't, but sometimes things happen that I can find no
explanation for.</TE>
<TE>   What is your spookiest experience?</TE>
<TE>   One time I was in a sound-mixing booth. Somebody rapped on the
windowsill beneath the booth and called my name. No one was there. It
happened twice.</TE>
<TE>   What era would you like to live in?</TE>
<TE>   The Roaring '20s sound like a lot of fun. New inventions were
becoming popular.</TE>
<TE>   Which do you prefer, burial or cremation?</TE>
<TE>   Cremation seems more final. It puts a period on it.</TE>

<TE>   Evan Pleger</TE>
<TE>   11, student, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Who was your character?</TE>
<TE>   Willie Cook (1893-1903) died at [age] 9. He was run over by a
streetcar near 44th Street and Central Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   What was your character like?</TE>
<TE>   Much like me: creative, polite. His grave is so cool: They spelled
his last name with hand signs for sign language. His mother was deaf
and mute.</TE>
<TE>   How did you end up in the role?</TE>
<TE>   My mom is [an organizer] of the tour. She likes to put us in
costumes.</TE>
<TE>   What's the spookiest part of L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb at Universal Studios really creeps
me out.</TE>
<TE>   What era would you like to live in?</TE>
<TE>   The Renaissance. We went to a Renaissance festival. I was in a
costume contest and lost to two younger boys because of the "cute"
factor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Albers</TE>
<TE>   57, librarian, Los Angeles Central Library</TE>
<TE>   Who was your character?</TE>
<TE>   May Knight Rindge (1864-1941) and her husband bought a ranch of
13,000 acres that became Malibu. Her daughter was Rhoda, and they
used her name backward for Adohr Stock Farms, the area's largest
dairy producer.</TE>
<TE>   What was she like?</TE>
<TE>   Feisty, stubborn. She came from a very determined family.</TE>
<TE>   How did you get in character?</TE>
<TE>   I went to the Adamson House in Malibu. The docent there is
marvelous, and I spent a day with him. Practicing at home, I put on
the costume and it helped a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Should people be afraid in cemeteries?</TE>
<TE>   No. Cemeteries are wonderful. I like reading the headstones and
the history.</TE>
<TE>   What era would you like to live in?</TE>
<TE>   I have this affinity for the 1940s, the style and the postwar
optimism.</TE>
<TE>   Which do you prefer, burial or cremation?</TE>
<TE>   I don't care if I'm buried or in an urn but I want a marker in the
cemetery in Angeles, Kan., near someone I'm related to.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Evan Beaumont</TE>
<TE>   17, student, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Who was your character?</TE>
<TE>   Myron Wilson Sr. (1916-2001) was my grandfather. He was [with] the
Tuskegee Airmen in World War II. He was fluent in German and
Japanese. My grandfather died last year and my uncle's buried here
and my brother.</TE>
<TE>   What was your grandfather like?</TE>
<TE>   He lived in Pearblossom. He was animated but set in his ways.</TE>
<TE>   How did you get in character?</TE>
<TE>   I knew him. I'd impersonate him when I was younger.</TE>
<TE>   How do you resemble him?</TE>
<TE>   My humor. All his children have it.</TE>
<TE>   Do you believe in ghosts?</TE>
<TE>   I believe in the spiritual world that's different from our world.</TE>
<TE>   What's the spookiest part of L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   I heard there's a home in West Adams where some Jesuit priests
lived. The Manson family used it and someone was killed there.</TE>
<TE>   What era would you like to live in?</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to live in the future. What the future holds is what
interests me.</TE>
<TE>   Which do you prefer, burial or cremation?</TE>
<TE>   Burial. I don't see any reason to be cremated.</TE>

<HD>A STAIN IN ALABAMA</HD>
<DH>WILLIAM MOORE WAS AN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF CIVIL RIGHTS, A
CAUSE HE WOULD DIE FOR. FORTY YEARS LATER, HIS MURDER REMAINS
UNSOLVED.</DH>
<SE></SE>

year's ''Growing Up in L.A.'' issue.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Willis Elrod's car hurtled through darkness along U.S. Highway 11, a
rural two-lane road bisecting old miseries and fresh hatreds in
northeast Alabama. A little before 9 p.m., Elrod passed through
Keener, a crossroads collection of houses and a small country store
in Etowah County, and then he was back out in open country heading
southwest for Birmingham and home. About four miles later, on a
stretch of highway lined by dairy farms and small stands of trees,
Elrod spotted the motionless form of a man lying on the left side of
the road, at the outer reach of his headlights. He turned around and
drove back the way he had come, scanning the roadside until he found
the spot again.</LD>
<LD>   ''I was concerned, curious, whatever,'' Elrod says as he recalls
that long-ago night in the spring of 1963. ''I went back to see if I
could do anything.''</LD>
<LD>   The man was lying face-down, his head turned to the side and the
shoeless feet pointing into a picnic turnout beneath a sweeping shade
tree. Elrod circled his car slowly around the man, gravel crunching
beneath his tires as he tried to make out details in the darkness.
Dead, he concluded. Probably a hit-and-run.</LD>
<TE>   Elrod inched back onto Highway 11 and drove 100 yards to a
farmhouse, where he interrupted Harry Sizemore in the midst of his
family's Tuesday ritual of watching ''The Red Skelton Show.''</TE>
<TE>   Elrod asked Sizemore to call authorities. ''Then he and I went
back down to where the body was.''</TE>
<TE>   At the turnout, Sizemore leaned forward as he played a flashlight
over the corpse, expecting it to be crushed and mangled from the
impact of a car. Instead, there was a small neat hole above the left
eyebrow, a second ragged hole on the left side of the throat, and a
small pool of blood. ''My God,'' Sizemore shouted as he jumped back.
''This man's been shot!''</TE>
<TE>   It took police less than a half-hour to identify the dead man as
William L. Moore, a 35-year-old white mailman from Binghamton, N.Y.
An ardent civil rights supporter, Moore was in the third day of a
quixotic, one-man crusade, walking across the South to hand-deliver a
letter demanding that Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett end segregation.
Within days, police pinpointed Floyd L. Simpson, 41, a taciturn
''investigator'' for the local Ku Klux Klan, as the likely killer.</TE>
<TE>   Racial tensions had been high in the South for more than a decade
as individual challenges to segregation merged into a mass movement
of sit-ins, boycotts and marches. Those tensions exploded in the
summer of '63, and Moore's murder on April 23 would prove to be just
the opening salvo.</TE>
<TE>   It was also a catalyst. James Forman, a leader of the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee at the time, credits Moore's murder
with helping energize the group. After the killing, Forman and other
activists launched a campaign to complete Moore's walk. ''Our policy
was that we had to respond to murders so the segregationists would
know there was going to be a response to violence,'' Forman recalled.
''We thought that would reduce the possibilities of the killing of
other people.'' But each walk ran into a wall of Alabama state
troopers, who hauled the marchers off to jail.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, rumblings in nearby Birmingham were evolving into
full-scale protests, and the nation's attention was quickly drawn
away from the Moore murder and those who wanted to finish his walk.
Within weeks, the civil rights movement coalesced in Birmingham, and
the world was introduced to photographs of Bull Connor and his
now-infamous police dogs and fire hoses.</TE>
<TE>   As the summer progressed, the civil rights movement seesawed
wildly from invigorating highs to soul-crushing lows. Five days
before Moore was killed, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had finished
his ''Letter from a Birmingham Jail,'' detailing the moral certitude
behind the movement. In August came the March on Washington, capped
by King's ''I Have a Dream'' speech. But at least 10 people would die
in the struggle that summer, including Medgar Evers, a black NAACP
field organizer shot in June in Mississippi. In September, four
school girls were killed by a KKK bomb as they primped in a basement
ladies room of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church. By then, most
of the country had forgotten about Moore, and about the Klansman
accused of killing him.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecution in the Moore case was bound to be problematic. Despite
legions of FBI infiltrators in the '60s, cracking the secrecy of the
most violent cadres of the Ku Klux Klan was difficult. In many cases,
local law enforcement aided segregationists and looked the other way
as Klansmen killed activists, beat pacifists and burned and bombed
homes and churches.</TE>
<TE>   It was not an atmosphere conducive to swift justice. William
Rayburn, the Etowah County prosecutor handling the Moore case,
predicted privately to FBI officials that, given the local mood, he
doubted a grand jury would indict Simpson--even if he signed a
confession. Rayburn was right: In September 1963, five months after
Moore's murder, an Etowah County grand jury decided there wasn't
enough evidence to charge Simpson.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes justice does reach back. On May 22 of this year, Bobby
Frank Cherry, 71, the last of four former Klansmen suspected of
blowing up the 16th Street Church, was convicted and sentenced to
life in prison one year after fellow Klansman Tommy Blanton was
convicted for his role. Byron De La Beckwith, Evers' murderer, was
convicted in 1994, three decades after that killing, and was
sentenced to life in a Mississippi prison, where he died last year.</TE>
<TE>   Emboldened by those successes, prosecutors have dusted off at
least 11 civil rights era cases in the South, hoping to bring fresh
charges. But countless other killings, including Moore's, have simply
faded into history. As time passes and suspects and witnesses die,
resolution becomes less likely. Simpson went to his grave four years
ago without ever publicly discussing the killing, or his arrest. His
wife and children maintain his silence.</TE>
<TE>   Moore's widow, remarried 32 years ago to a quarryman and stone
artist, lives on a 288-acre spread in rural northeast Pennsylvania.
Mary Moore Birchard still has questions about what happened on that
dark road in northeast Alabama, about why the grand jury decided not
to indict Simpson despite eyewitness accounts placing a car like his
at the scene, ballistics tests that found the killer's rifle was the
same make and model as Simpson's, and Simpson's refusal to tell
investigators what he had done after 4 p.m. on that cloudy spring
day.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's always been my prayer that I would know who killed him
before I die,'' Mary says.</TE>
<TE>   There's more at stake than a widow's desire for certainty. Moore's
murder remains part of the nation's unfinished business, a stain that
can only be rinsed out with the truth, even if the guilty are beyond
reach.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Moore cut an odd, solitary figure as he strolled along
Highway 11. Standing 6 feet, 2 inches tall and weighing 205 pounds,
his imposing size was undercut by a gentle, wry smile. He wore a top
coat, usually unzipped, and after the first day walked mostly in his
socks because of blisters caused by his shoes. He pulled a small
two-wheel shopping cart behind him, holding a change of clothes, some
pamphlets and a diary he was keeping of the trip.</TE>
<TE>   Moore's plan was to be a human lightning rod. If you're going to
protest, he reasoned, there was little sense in doing it
inconspicuously. So he made a large sandwich board sign and slipped
it over his coat. The front read in large block letters: ''End
Segregation in America,'' and, in smaller letters, ''Black or White
Eat at Joe's.'' On the back it read: ''Equal Rights for All'' above
''Mississippi or Bust.'' His cart bore the sign: ''Wanted: Jesus
Christ, Agitator, carpenter by trade, revolutionary, consorter with
criminals and prostitutes.''</TE>
<TE>   Either set of messages was likely to inflame passions along his
planned southwesterly route from Chattanooga, Tenn., through a corner
of Georgia into Alabama, then across the state into Mississippi. The
route began in the Bible Belt and moved into the Black Belt, the
rich, fertile area across the middle lowlands of Alabama where whites
were a minority and the Klan particularly active. ''This could be
something big, for which my whole life has been a sort of
preparation,'' Moore said in a letter to his wife. ''I don't intend
to back out now . . . . I would not be surprised if I were beaten &amp;
arrested more than once . . . . So I'm planning as best I can for any
eventuality.''</TE>
<TE>   By that point, protest was a way of life for Moore. He'd grown up
in Binghamton, N.Y., and after serving with the Marines in the
Pacific during World War II, used the GI Bill to attend a series of
colleges in the U.S. and Europe. In early 1953, increasingly erratic
behavior led his family to commit him to a Binghamton mental
institution, where he underwent treatment (including electroshock
therapy) for paranoid schizophrenia. He emerged in August 1954 with a
manuscript that he self-published as ''The Mind in Chains,'' a book
little noted at the time. It was written with a subtle,
self-deprecating sense of humor, capturing Moore's deep outrage over
injustice and his belief that individual actions can lead to broad
change.</TE>
<TE>   Moore held a series of jobs, including that of mailman, while
working on the side to organize a support group for fellow former
mental patients and marching for peace and against atomic weapons
testing. The day after Moore's murder, Tom Cawley, a columnist for
the Binghamton Press, wrote that Moore was considered a bit of a
local loony, always protesting something and firing off letters to
the editor. ''It all seemed so futile--a post office worker trying to
save the world, single-handed.''</TE>
<TE>   Moore didn't see his efforts as futile. He thought he could help
end segregation, a cause that consumed him after he read books on
lynchings and the brutal conditions in which Southern blacks were
forced to live. Mary says he was particularly incensed by the
beatings of Freedom Riders in Anniston, Ala., in 1961, and the
burning of their buses. By this time Moore was a mailman; he liked
being able to rush through his route in the morning and then agitate
in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1962, Moore arranged a transfer from Binghamton to
Baltimore to be closer to the action; his wife and stepchildren would
follow after school let out. Within weeks, Moore decided to use what
he called his ''professional skills'' as a mailman to protest
segregation, and he started planning his walk across the South. The
quest was both political and personal: Moore's family had roots in
the South, and he felt that gave him an added responsibility to make
a stand. He arranged to take two weeks' vacation and on April 21
stepped off a bus in Chattanooga.</TE>
<TE>   Moore's log notes that he slept the first night on an old bus
abandoned alongside a Georgia road. The second night, he rented a
motel room in Fort Payne, Ala. Moore's log also notes encounters with
whites who did not rain hatred on him, like the woman who gave him a
free milkshake after he told her what he was up to, and the two white
youths who offered him a ride, not quite grasping that he intended to
walk the whole way. But in some places restrooms were closed to him,
and a few businesses refused to serve him once they saw his signs.
Some people, including police who asked him to abandon his walk,
warned Moore that he likely would be killed in Birmingham; others
guessed he'd survive as far as Mississippi. Moore shrugged them off,
as he did the mostly young Southern voices that dripped venom from
passing cars: ''Nigger lover! Why don't you go back up north where
you belong!''</TE>
<TE>   Floyd Simpson, a quiet, slightly built high school dropout, was a
stranger in his hometown of Fort Payne, a small Alabama city along
Route 11 northeast of Etowah County. ''He could be in a crowd of
three and you wouldn't notice him,'' said John Chambers, an amateur
Fort Payne historian who knew Simpson. The former mayor, Fred Purdy,
was about the same age as Simpson, born in 1922, and couldn't recall
ever meeting Simpson as a kid. He first heard of him when he was
arrested in connection with Moore's murder. Even the minister who
lived next to Simpson's parents, and who buried Simpson four years
ago, only knew him to say hello.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few people who knew Simpson well was George Killian, a
gregarious long-distance truck driver who still lives four miles
southwest of Fort Payne in Collbran, a crossroads hamlet on Highway
11 where most of the mailboxes carry the name Killian. George Killian
was younger than Simpson by a decade, but by the time the early '60s
came around, Killian was the leader of the Fort Payne Klavern of the
Klan to which Simpson belonged.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Killian claims to be a changed man. Rangy with white
hair, he stretches out in a recliner in a back room of his neatly
kept modular home and mutes a game show on the television set. Two
hunting rifles--loaded, he points out--lean against a doorjamb. A
military 50-caliber rifle stands on a bipod on the floor in front of
the TV, a gun-lover's art display.</TE>
<TE>   Killian freely admits his Klan connections in the '60s. ''We were
all segregationists, but not the kind that would go out and murder
somebody,'' he says. As a born-again Baptist, Killian belongs to what
he describes as the integrated Gravel Hill Baptist Church, and said
he freely accepts African Americans as his equal. But Killian's
conversion doesn't extend to violating the infamous Klan vow of
silence, and he refuses to discuss Simpson's role in the Klan. He
acknowledges that his friend had been a member only after being told
that FBI files listed Simpson's rank as ''klokan,'' or investigator,
and detailed meetings that Simpson had attended. ''Notice that you
told me, I didn't tell you,'' Killian says.</TE>
<TE>   Killian doesn't believe Simpson was behind the killing, and he has
his own theory that a stranger followed Moore into the Fort Payne
area. ''There's no way I could believe Floyd Simpson would be capable
of that,'' Killian says. ''He was a quiet-like fella. He didn't
express a lot of opinions on things. If he had an opinion, he kept it
mostly to himself.</TE>
<TE>   ''I never saw a change in Floyd'' after the killing, Killian adds.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson held a series of jobs in the '50s and '60s. He worked in
one of Fort Payne's hosiery mills, was a carpenter's helper and
pumped gas at a local garage. He regularly attended Klan meetings,
according to FBI files that describe him as a lifetime member. Though
the Moore murder was the only violent incident in which he was
suspected of being involved, FBI agents questioned Simpson in 1965
about dynamite bombs found in Birmingham. ''Simpson stated he had no
information concerning these bombs . . . and if he would have
information, he is doubtful he would advise the FBI,'' reads a
statement in the file.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 1963, Simpson was running a small country grocery
store in Collbran, another stop on Moore's path to Birmingham. The
morning Moore walked into the store looking to buy a snack, Simpson
was working the register. George Killian was there, too, with his
father, Jack, and at least two other people. The conversation was
congenial, Killian recalls.</TE>
<TE>   ''We asked him, 'Why not walk for the American Indians?' He said,
'They're not as bad off as the black folks are.' '' Killian said he
left later that day to make a delivery and was out of town when the
killing occurred.</TE>
<TE>   According to police and witness accounts, Simpson was agitated by
Moore's beliefs, including his sign about Christ consorting with
prostitutes. Later in the day, Simpson drove Gad Killian, George's
uncle and the owner of the store Simpson ran, to catch up with Moore.
The elder Killian wanted to talk to this strange man from the north.</TE>
<TE>   ''It was odd, him walking like that, and I wanted to see him,''
says Gad Killian, who is now 83. Simpson and Killian caught up with
Moore and talked with him for a few minutes before driving back to
the Collbran store, Gad Killian says. ''I don't know anything about
what happened. And neither does Floyd. He was right there in that
[shop] window around the time it happened. My nephew was driving by
and waved at him and he waved back. Now how could he have been down
there?''</TE>
<TE>   Both Killians referred to that passing wave as an ironclad alibi
for Simpson, though it doesn't show up in the prosecutor's files.
What does show up is Simpson's refusal to discuss what he did once he
and Gad Simpson returned to Collbran.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Hedgspeth's office anchors a ground floor corner of Etowah
County's new criminal justice center, an airy glass and steel
building at the northern edge of downtown Gadsden, the county seat.
The room, with its indirect ceiling lights, thick curtains and
shelves of books, is conducive to talking, and Hedgspeth does,
reeling through historic elements of Alabama politics and moments
from his own life.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the Moore case remains open, though pragmatically it
ended when the grand jury decided not to indict. ''There is a
difference between knowing who did something and proving it,''
Hedgspeth says. He flips through the file, mostly carbon copies on
onion-skin paper. There are ballistics reports that conclude the two
bullets that killed Moore were fired from a rifle like Simpson's
.22-caliber automatic, but the bullets were too badly damaged for an
exact match. The file also holds a letter from Rayburn, one of
Hedgspeth's predecessors, to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover seeking
federal lab help in examining the bullets; an investigators'
narrative and a list of witnesses called before the grand jury. Most
of the witnesses were police officers and lab workers, the men who
found the body and the woman who served Moore his last meal in
Keener, a short distance from the killing scene.</TE>
<TE>   Three Gadsden journalists also were subpoenaed to testify. They
had driven out along Highway 11 an hour before the killing,
responding to anonymous calls to their offices that they might ''find
something newsworthy.'' The reporters saw an early '50s black Buick
like Simpson's parked near where Moore would be killed, with a
heavyset man behind the wheel. Simpson was slightly built, and in a
later lineup the reporters picked out a different man, who passed a
subsequent lie detector test that investigators said cleared him of
involvement. Another witness said she saw a similar car with a
license plate beginning with ''28''--the designation for Dekalb
County, where Simpson lived--turn around in her driveway near the
murder scene, but she couldn't see the driver. And yet another
witness reported seeing a man he couldn't identify walking toward a
black car near the spot about the time of the killing.</TE>
<TE>   The official investigation report concludes that Moore was likely
killed by someone firing a .22- caliber rifle from inside a car about
10 feet away. The first bullet struck Moore just above the left
eyebrow, passed through his brain and lodged against the back of his
skull, killing him instantly. The second bullet, apparently fired as
Moore fell backward from the impact of the first, struck him in the
left side of the neck, then moved upward through the lower part of
his skull and emerged just above the left ear. Improbably, the
medical examiner found the bullet in Moore's shirt pocket, as though
the dead man had stashed it away for safekeeping.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Moore was sleeping in her house-trailer outside Binghamton,
N.Y., when the phone rang. Late-night calls rarely bear good news,
and when the man on the other end of the line identified himself as a
coroner in Gadsden, Ala., Mary felt weak and panicky. The man asked a
lot of questions about what Moore was doing in Alabama while refusing
to tell her why he was asking. Finally, he asked her to summon a
neighbor--any neighbor-- to the phone. ''Right then I knew something
had really gone bad,'' she recalls. ''Pastor Drewry lived in the
trailer next door so I ran over in my nightgown and banged on his
door and said, 'There's a man on the phone that wants to talk to
you.' ''</TE>
<TE>   After a short conversation with the coroner, Drewry told Mary the
obvious. ''You don't want to hear it. You don't want to believe it,''
she says. ''It was like my head was just falling backward, even
though I was sitting on the couch.'' Mary's life had not been easy,
and it was about to get exponentially worse. She married her first
husband when she was young to get away from her father, who beat her
and a brother. Her husband, with whom she had three children, was
also abusive. ''It was out of the frying pan into the fire.'' She
turned for help to Moore, whom she met during his regular visits to
read to Mary's blind neighbor. Moore tried to talk Mary's husband
into changing his ways. When that failed, he helped Mary and the
children move out. A year later, they married.</TE>
<TE>   Mary sympathized with Moore's politics, but she was too busy
working at a Binghamton electronics assembly line and raising her
three children to get involved. After Moore was murdered, she
attended one rally, driven by a desire to resume her husband's work.
''He said that if we all worked harder we could make this world a
better place,'' Mary says. Then the phone calls started. Mary should
be in the same place as her dead husband, a voice would say. Or, I
know where your children are. ''It was a very frightening time,''
Mary says. ''Things were just too hot.'' Even her factory co-workers
were suddenly distant, avoiding her at lunch. More than 100 people
worked at the plant, but a collection for the family yielded only
$20. Mary retreated into herself.</TE>
<TE>   ''I didn't talk to anybody,'' she says. ''I just wasn't nice
anymore. It was probably a year and a half before I laughed or
smiled.''</TE>
<TE>   Mary sits in a ground-floor room with spring sunshine streaming
through double doors opening to the backyard. The room overlooks a
20-acre pond her current husband, Courtland Birchard, made in the
'50s by damming up spring-fed marshland on his 288-acre share of
family land about 20 miles southwest of Binghamton. The couple met
about a year after Moore was killed. It was one of those chance
encounters in which romance was the last thing anyone expected. Mary
was looking for some slag rock to fill in a low spot outside her
trailer and someone told her Birchard was the guy she needed. She
looked him up, one thing led to another, and in 1965 the couple
married.</TE>
<TE>   Birchard sits quietly on a separate couch as Mary talks. Outside,
bees dance around flowers in the backyard. A diving osprey makes a
spectacular splash, then flies off with one of the trout the couple
stock in their pond. Upstairs is a small showroom where they sell
Birchard's stone engravings of birds and flags and other icons of
rural America.</TE>
<TE>   ''I sympathize with those 9-11 people,'' Mary says, words tumbling
over tears. ''They talk about closure like it's a book, but it's not
true. It can settle and you can go on, but it's always there.''</TE>
<TE>   In the days after Moore's murder, Mary's family provided little
solace. Her father, following the lead of an uncle, was a devoted
Klan member. Mary's mother shared her husband's beliefs but rejected
them during that violent summer of '63. It wasn't the killing of her
daughter's husband, though, that led to a change of heart. ''My
mother changed when she saw the children and the dogs,'' Mary says.
''She said, 'That's not right.' ''</TE>
<TE>   Seared into Mary's memory is the first time she stepped into the
family house in the days after Bill Moore was murdered. Her father
turned to her with a sneer and said, ''Well, I guess they showed
him.''</TE>
<TE>   It seems likely that there are people still alive who know what
happened on that rural Alabama road. While the decision by the grand
jury to not indict Simpson was interpreted as just another example of
Southern injustice, the case against him had problems. It is
plausible that Simpson simply offered up his car and his rifle to the
killer.</TE>
<TE>   People know. Getting them to tell is the difficult part. Murder
has no statute of limitations, and unless the killer is dead, the
truth can still hurt.</TE>
<TE>   If there's anyone who might be able to say what Floyd Simpson was
doing on that April night in 1963, it's his wife, Lucille, who still
lives in the single-story wood-frame house in Fort Payne that they
bought in 1970 when he worked maintenance for the Dekalb Baptist
Hospital. It's a modest house, as are the others in this
working-class neighborhood. An American flag hangs inside the front
storm door facing the Mount Carmel Baptist Church across the street,
where Lucille attends Sunday services. The window curtains are drawn
and it looks like no one is home, but the inside door opens slowly
before the first footfall clunks on the wooden steps. A short,
elderly woman with unnaturally tight curls over faded blue eyes looks
out, her face in a gentle half-smile of polite expectation as she
pushes open the storm door.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, she answers, she is Lucille Simpson. As soon as William
Moore's name is mentioned, the smile vanishes and she shakes her
head. ''No, no comment,'' she says. ''I don't want to.'' She turns
down a business card offered in case she changes her mind, in case
she decides to talk about what it was like for her husband to live
half his life in a town where many people his age believe he got away
with murder. ''No,'' she says. ''No, I won't change my mind.''
Neither will the children. ''No,'' she says, with the steel of a
matriarch accustomed to being obeyed, ''I wouldn't let them.''</TE>
<TE>   A slender, black-haired man in his early 30s emerges from around
the side of the house, followed by a young boy. They toss a white
ball beneath a leafless tree, the sky heavy with ragged gray clouds
that shroud the hilltops. The boy is laughing and jumping. The man is
impassive, eyeing the conversation on the porch. Lucille Simpson
closes the storm door, and there's nothing left to do but leave.</TE>
<TE>   The steps are taken carefully, then the sidewalk. Silent glances
are exchanged with the man in the yard, who reacts stonily to a nod
of the head. The sound of the car door closing echoes through the
quiet neighborhood. After a few moments, yet another car inches onto
an Alabama road and drives off. Two sets of eyes watch: the young man
on the lawn and the old woman behind the door. It's dusk, and the
shaded backyard is already lost to the coming darkness.</TE>

<AU>DAVID DAVIS</AU>
<BD>David Davis is a Los Angeles writer who last wrote for
the magazine about boxer Sugar Shane Mosley.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Into the Chick Hearn media room they flock, news, business and sports
reporters alike, mingling uneasily if affably in the bowels of
Staples Center. No journalist can afford to miss this news
conference: After an absence of seven years, the NFL is absolutely,
positively coming back to Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   In the room are the civic leaders whose political and financial
clout will deliver the only missing piece in L.A.'s sports
landscape--a football team playing in a proposed $450-million,
64,000-seat football stadium near Staples. On the dais, Tim Leiweke,
president of the sprawling conglomerate that built and operates
Staples, confers with developer-partner Edward Roski Jr. Sitting
quietly between them is a handsome young man with neatly tousled
black hair, a strong nose and a toothy grin. He is Casey Wasserman,
whom GQ magazine dubbed a ''Jewish Tom Cruise, a kosher Kennedy.''
Today, dressed in a gray three-button suit, his white shirt splashed
with a baby blue tie, he looks like an earnest college grad readying
for a job interview.</LD>
<TE>   His age, 28, and a determined deference to his elders peg him as
''junior partner.'' On the surface, he brings to the partnership
little more than ownership of the one professional football team in
town--the Avengers of the indoor Arena Football League, a fringe
sport that has failed to capture much public attention. As Mayor
James K. Hahn emphasizes that no public funds will be used for the
stadium, and Leiweke muses that the new stadium could bring millions
of tourist dollars to Southern California by hosting Super Bowls, the
media ignore Wasserman.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps they shouldn't. For while this news conference is,
ostensibly, about a new stadium, it's also the coming-out party for
Wasserman. Born to Hollywood royalty, platinum spoon squarely in
mouth, he has been groomed for a life of wheeling-dealing by the man
who invented and perfected those very moves: his grandfather,
legendary MCA/Universal head Lew Wasserman. Indeed, Casey has used
his family's name and fortune to amass a networking base that rivals
Leiweke's. He's on almost as many boards of directors as Phil Jackson
has championship rings--including the Amateur Athletic Foundation,
the L.A. Sports Council and the Jules Stein Eye Institute. His
advisors include Democratic Party stalwart Vernon Jordan, former
Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley and prominent entertainment attorney Ken
Ziffren, who also happens to be his father-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   It was Wasserman who ignited this football stadium plan,
approaching the partners, including supermarket magnate Ron Burkle.
With Leiweke and Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz's firm, Anschutz
Entertainment Group, Wasserman quietly scoured South Park for the
proposed site along 11th Street and purchased options for the land.
Finally, he established a beachhead with the NFL through a friend,
executive vice president Roger Goodell, to pave the way for league
approval of the deal and, not so incidentally, a $150-million loan.
The only remaining question, it seemed, was which team would move to
L.A.: the San Diego Chargers, the Arizona Cardinals or the Minnesota
Vikings.</TE>
<TE>   As Leiweke says, only half-jokingly: ''If this works, Casey gets
all the credit. If it doesn't, he gets all the blame.''</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman smiles. The heir apparent is ready for some football.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks later, Wasserman's world has turned upside down. The stadium
deal unraveled swiftly. After meeting vociferous resistance, the
partners withdrew the proposal. And, Lew Wasserman, whom Casey
describes as "my best friend, my father and my grandfather all in one
person,'' succumbed to complications from a stroke at the age of 89.
''I can only do what would have made my grandfather proud, which is
to continue on with life,'' young Wasserman says. ''You can't sit
around and mope.''</TE>
<TE>   It is a summer day in Wasserman's office. Wearing tan pants and a
blue Oxford shirt open at the neck, he looks nothing like a GQ poster
boy. Sniffling with allergies, his face sullied by two days of
bearded scruff, he appears exhausted. ''My grandfather is the first
family member I've lost,'' he says. ''And to have the most dominating
presence in my life be the first . . . '' His voice trails off.</TE>
<TE>   As advertised, he seems wizened beyond his years. The comparison
to John F. Kennedy Jr. is ambitious but not without some merit, and
not necessarily because of his looks. Rather, he carries gracefully
the expectations of his family's name. ''Casey has a kindness to him,
a lightness to him, that attracts people to his humanity,'' says
longtime friend Skip Paul, a former Universal board member and
chairman of IFilm, an online collection of movie clips and short
films.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman claims he is frustrated, not angry, at opposition to the
stadium. The County Board of Supervisors voted to sue Los Angeles,
claiming that including the project in the city's downtown
redevelopment plan would usurp tax revenue from the county. Faced
with the prospect of extinction, the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission,
which operates the Memorial Coliseum, dusted off a plan to renovate
the stadium and demanded a seat at the NFL trough. Community groups
derided the stadium as a lucrative windfall for multimillionaire
developers in an area of the city that desperately needs affordable
housing. (Those developers--Anschutz, Roski and Burkle--are all on
Forbes' magazine's list of the nation's 400 wealthiest people.)
Finally, except for Hahn, no elected official endorsed the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   According to Wasserman, the Coliseum's efforts were the
deal-breaker. ''We didn't think the Coliseum would come back because
the NFL couldn't have been more clear: They're never going back
there,'' he says, his voice beginning to rise. ''For some reason, the
commission doesn't understand this. Let's be clear. Six professional
and college teams have left that facility--the Los Angeles Dodgers,
the Los Angeles Chargers, the Los Angeles Rams, the Los Angeles
Raiders, the UCLA Bruins . . . '' Actually, the sixth never played at
the Coliseum. The Los Angeles Clippers had played at the Sports
Arena, which is administered by the commission, before departing for
Staples.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman says his group has surrendered most of its options to
purchase the downtown land. He says he's pursuing other deals that he
politely, but firmly, refuses to detail. Besides the Avengers, he
owns minor league indoor-football franchises in Fresno and
Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't deny, however, that the partners might reenter the
fray, perhaps after the football season. ''In six months, if the
Coliseum's dead and there's a groundswell to bring us back, we would
step back in,'' he says. ''I'm a very strong believer in football and
its value to the city of Los Angeles. But we're not going to get our
heads handed to us every day in the press, and we're not going to get
manipulated and abused by city politicians who don't have the city in
their best interests.''</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman operates from the third floor of a squat, glass-enclosed
office building he owns at the western edge of Beverly Hills. He
knows the neighborhood well, having grown up in 90210, just blocks
from his grandparents' house. He still lives nearby, with his wife,
Laura, who works as a music supervisor in the movie industry. He's
long been a regular at Dan Tana's restaurant and Nate 'n' Al's, the
old-school Jewish deli.</TE>
<TE>   His spacious corner office looks like a sports junkie's fantasy
hideaway. An ''NBA Blitz 2000'' video game stands sentry at the
doorway, while a muted television shows the U.S. Open golf
tournament. Framed autographed jerseys of baseball slugger Mark
McGwire and L.A. Kings forward Ziggy Palffy compete for floor space
with a box of footballs. An autographed copy of "The John Wooden
Pyramid of Success'' sits on a windowsill, near a ticket from the
second Evander Holyfield-Mike Tyson heavyweight bout. On one wall is
a gift from the NFL's Goodell: a poster-sized photograph of the 1932
title game, played indoors because of inclement weather.</TE>
<TE>   Next to his desk, opposite two computer screens, are family
photographs, including one featuring his grandfather, sleek silver
mane in place, smiling behind his trademark oversized black glasses,
which director Steven Spielberg once quipped looked like ''two movie
screens.'' To describe Lew Wasserman simply as MCA's chairman is like
saying Shaquille O'Neal plays basketball. Wasserman's influence in
Hollywood was unsurpassed. He resolved labor disputes between the
studios and the Screen Actors Guild, championed television production
when the new medium was considered a threat to movies, built
Universal CityWalk to increase revenue streams, raised millions for
the Democratic Party, and funded numerous local charities, including
the Jules Stein Eye Institute and the Motion Picture &amp; Television
Fund.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he sold control of MCA to Matsushita Electric
Industrial in 1990, he was among the wealthiest men in America. Lew
and his wife, Edie, had it all--power, money, entree to movie stars
and U.S. presidents. Everything but a son. ''I was unfortunate not to
have a son,'' he once told Los Angeles magazine.</TE>
<TE>   In his biography of Wasserman, author Dennis McDougal wrote that
Lew and Edie's only daughter, Lynne, struggled to find her identity
as the child of a ''workaholic absentee father and a spotlight-hungry
mother.'' Lynne's first marriage, to MCA agent Ron Leif, ended in
divorce. (They had a daughter, Carol Ann, Casey's half-sister.) So,
too, did her second marriage, to stockbroker Jack Meyrowitz. The two
were married in 1970, and changed their name to Myers.</TE>
<TE>   Casey Myers, born in 1974, was 7 when his parents separated. He
was raised, he says, "essentially single-handedly" by his mother. He
says he last saw his father in 1996, the year he graduated from UCLA.
They occasionally speak by phone. By all accounts, Lew stepped into
the paternal void. He rearranged his schedule to watch Casey play
high-school tennis matches at the exclusive Brentwood School. Every
Saturday and Sunday, the two would schlep to Nate 'n' Al's. Lew would
have his usual breakfast--pumpernickel bagel with cream cheese, and
bacon--then they'd drive to Universal and stroll around.</TE>
<TE>   ''Lew was disappointed he never had a son,'' McDougal says in an
interview. ''In his typical fashion, by dint of his power and his
money and his overbearing personality, he took what he wanted. He
essentially stole Jack Myers' son. By the time Casey was a teenager,
the die was cast. He was Lew's little boy.''</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Casey changed his last name to Wasserman. He says it was
a repudiation of his father, who had been convicted in a
money-laundering deal gone bad, and an acknowledgment of his ''real''
family. ''It's no secret that I have, at best, a strained and awkward
relationship with my dad,'' he says. ''The Wasserman family--my mom,
my sister, Lew and Edie--raised me. They are the people I define as
my family.''</TE>
<TE>   Jack Myers now lives in the Palms Springs area, where he plays
scratch golf and cares for his aging parents. He's reluctant to speak
about Casey, fearful that he'll ''say something wrong'' to further
strain their relationship. ''I was not represented by legal counsel
[for my divorce] because I believed all issues, including visitation
rights, could be resolved amicably,'' Myers says in a written
statement to the Los Angeles Times Magazine. ''While I did see Casey
while he was growing up, we did not forge the kind of relationship I
had envisioned. I love my son and I am optimistic that we will spend
more time together.''</TE>
<TE>   Lew Wasserman included Casey in business dealings, what one
observer called ''the equivalent of going to business school.'' Most
lessons came via osmosis, through observation of Lew's legendary
habits--his 60-hour workweeks, conservative dress code, privacy and
civic boosterism. ''Lew wasn't one to tell people what to do,'' says
former Universal executive Paul. ''He told you what he thought and
allowed you to make your own mistakes.''</TE>
<TE>   ''The only word he ever talked about was 'anticipation,' '' Casey
says of the advice from his grandfather. ''So that's something I hold
close to my heart.''</TE>
<TE>   Lew introduced Casey to his influential friends. Many of
them--including Paul and former Dodgers owner O'Malley--became
Casey's mentors and then his confidants. ''From his family, Casey was
introduced to a lot of knowledgeable people,'' O'Malley says. ''He
interacted with others who were older and more experienced. Now he
has this incredible combination of the enthusiasm and the energy of
youth and the knowledge and experience of a seasoned executive. I've
never seen anything like it.''</TE>
<TE>   Lew's influence also extended to Casey's personal life. His wife,
Laura Ziffren, is the granddaughter of one of Lew's closest friends,
the late attorney Paul Ziffren. A former classmate of Laura's called
their marriage "a Hollywood merger."</TE>
<TE>   When Casey turned 21, he received a multimillion-dollar trust
fund. That same year, Lew made him president of the family's
charitable foundation. The Wasserman Foundation has assets of more
than $100 million; it doles out 5% of that annually, primarily for
education, health and welfare, and Jewish culture. The foundation
also gave money for downtown's new Catholic cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   Casey has followed his grandfather's political lead. According to
the Center for Responsive Politics, Wasserman has donated more than
$30,000 to Democratic candidates and the national party since 2000.
In January, he hosted fund-raisers for the Clinton presidential
library and Andrew Cuomo, then running for New York governor. Last
month, Wasserman and his wife accompanied former President Bill
Clinton to Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Lew also was a major sports fan, and Casey says he knew from the
time he first decorated his room with posters of athletes and team
decals that he wanted to be in sports. The family held season tickets
to the Dodgers, UCLA basketball and the Raiders. Lew's octopus-like
connections extended into the sports world. Through his friendship
with NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Lew and Edie attended Rozelle's
annual Super Bowl bashes. Another buddy of Lew's, Cleveland Browns
owner Art Modell, made Casey a ball boy at 12. He flew to Cleveland
for home games.</TE>
<TE>   On at least three occasions, says Casey, Lew nearly purchased an
NFL franchise. In the early 1960s, Rams owner Dan Reeves offered to
sell him 50% of the team, Casey says, but Wasserman's boss, MCA
founder Jules Stein, nixed the deal because he didn't believe it was
appropriate for an MCA executive. In the early 1980s, when Al Davis
first threatened to move the Oakland Raiders to L.A., Wasserman
became involved as a court-appointed mediator attempting to resolve
the dispute. In one scenario, Casey says, Lew would have obtained a
share of an expansion franchise in L.A., and the Raiders would have
stayed in Oakland. Later, after Davis moved the Raiders to L.A. and
was considering relocating to a proposed stadium at Hollywood Park,
Wasserman planned to buy in as a minority partner--and give Casey a
role with the team.</TE>
<TE>   ''The idea was, I would learn the business,'' Casey says. ''Of
course, three years later, Davis moved back to Oakland.''</TE>
<TE>   After he graduated from UCLA with a political science degree,
Casey and his grandfather made a deal. Casey would find an
opportunity, one they would both invest in, to get his feet wet. He
looked at minor league hockey in Minnesota and minor league baseball
in Georgia before discovering an inexpensive alternative: the Arena
Football League. His NFL contact, Goodell, recommended Wasserman to
AFL commissioner David Baker. In October 1998, the AFL approved him
for an expansion franchise. For a $5-million buy-in fee, the
24-year-old became the youngest owner in sports.</TE>
<TE>   Purchasing the Avengers, says Wasserman, allows him ''to get my
PhD in sports. There's no way to do it except to do it. They don't
teach you how to fire a coach, how to name a team, contract for a
stadium lease, design uniforms. That I could learn all this in my
home marketplace was an incredible bonus.''</TE>
<TE>   Another motive, he admits, was the opportunity to create his own
name. ''I was willing to accept a bad reputation if I deserved it,
but it was going to be based on my actions, not on anybody's history.
I'm not running from my family--I couldn't embrace my family more.
But I wanted to work in an industry where I could define myself, not
be defined by my grandfather's history.''</TE>
<TE>   If you go to watch the Avengers play at Staples Center, be sure to
bring earplugs. The national anthem and player introductions are
punctuated by thunderous fireworks, while P.A. announcer Sam Lagana
does his best Sam Kinison imitation, exhorting the crowd to ''STAAAND
WITH YOUR AVENGERS!'' Whenever play halts, snippets of music erupt
from gigantic speakers, a selection of songs that can only be
described as frat-party rock. Were an earthquake to occur during a
game, no one would notice.</TE>
<TE>   For all its noise, the Arena Football League remains a marginal
product. Its claim to fame is that St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt
Warner played for the AFL's Iowa Barnstormers before moving to the
NFL and becoming a Super Bowl hero. The 16-year-old league styles
itself as a throwback, akin to after-school pickup games, without the
parked cars and blacktop. Instead of 11 players, as in traditional
football, Arena football has eight players on each side--and six of
them must play both offense and defense, unheard of in the NFL. The
field is half that of a regulation football field, so scoring happens
early and often. It's a sport for the X-Games generation:
high-scoring froth that's easily digestible and mildly compelling.</TE>
<TE>   When the Avengers played the Dallas Desperados during the summer,
Dallas jumped to a 31-14 lead by half-time. To the delight of the
12,309 in attendance, the Avengers stormed back, scoring on three
consecutive drives to take a 35-31 lead. They lost, 62-55. Afterward,
players eating pizza wandered into the stands to sign autographs.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman usually mingles with fans and players after games, but
not that night. His grandfather was ill, having suffered the stroke
that eventually killed him. Casey watched the game from his Staples
Center suite. ''They had no idea how long he was going to live,'' he
says. ''I can tell you unequivocally: The one thing he would have
wanted was for me to go to the game."</TE>
<TE>   After Lew's death, the Avengers wore black ''LRW'' patches on
their uniforms. For the first time in their three-year history, the
Avengers made the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Operating below the media's radar, Wasserman is learning how to be
a sports executive. In 2000, before the Avengers had played a down,
AFL owners voted to cancel the season because they couldn't reach a
labor agreement with players. As the new chairman of the league's
labor committee, Wasserman took over the negotiations. His tenacity
during an all-night negotiation session at Chicago's O'Hare Airport
Hilton--shades of his grandfather's labor involvement--resulted in a
long-term collective bargaining agreement, AFL Commissioner Baker
says. ''We just got to the point where we couldn't move forward. This
meeting was the last chance, and Casey helped to save the season.''</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman also chaired the committee that negotiated the league's
breakthrough television contract, which begins with NBC next year.
The AFL has never had network coverage, a void that severely
curtailed its growth. To land NBC, the AFL agreed to two major
concessions: the league will shift its start-date to February, or
right after the 2003 Super Bowl, and grant NBC the option to buy the
TV rights in perpetuity. Again, family connections proved important:
the AFL's attorney was Ken Ziffren, Casey's father-in-law, who had
previously worked with NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol.</TE>
<TE>   The perpetuity clause could curtail future league profits. Even
so, the contract is seen as a coup. ''He's been very savvy,'' says
David Carter of the Sports Business Group, a Los Angeles consulting
firm. ''The keys to success in the sports industry are distribution,
which means TV deals, and labor peace. He's shown agility and ability
without making a game-over blunder.''</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, L.A.'s sports power brokers were easy to identify.
Walter O'Malley uprooted the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1958, then built a
beatific stadium. In the 1960s, Jack Kent Cooke created the Fabulous
Forum in Inglewood, made the Lakers fashionable and introduced NHL
ice hockey to Southern California. Gene Autry took his Angels to
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Today, L.A.'s most powerful sports figure is Anschutz, whose
organization owns a majority share of the Kings and nearly one-third
of the Lakers. He also built Staples and owns half of it, runs the
L.A. Galaxy, and is building a soccer-tennis stadium complex in
Carson. Yet because the media-challenged Anschutz hasn't given an
interview since the Nixon years, the public knows little about
him--although he has been in the news recently as the subject of
investigations into corporate malfeasance as founder and former
chairman of Qwest Communications. The heads of other sports
franchises are also obscure, for with corporate ownership comes
anonymity. Disney owns the Angels; the Dodgers are owned by News
Corp. Could anyone identify Bob Daly, titular head of the Dodgers, in
a lineup?</TE>
<TE>   With the Avengers, Wasserman took his first steps into this inner
circle. His relationship with Leiweke and the Anschutz group assures
him access to the city's most influential sports minds. His
philanthropic work--along with his Democratic Party and Beverly Hills
connections--places him in the middle of L.A.'s political, social and
financial vortex. He may not yet have rainmaker influence, but he has
the next best thing: the perception of pull.</TE>
<TE>   Says USC's Carter: ''He's already a power broker, not because of
what he's done but because of what he's capable of doing. In sports
business, you can't teach money, you can't teach access, and you
can't teach youth. He has those three things. He's going to be a
formidable force, long-term, in this town.''</TE>
<TE>   Others question whether he has the vision--and the will--to
accomplish big deals, their doubts perhaps best summed up by a
prominent L.A. sports figure who refused to be identified. ''He's had
everything handed to him--wealth, access, advice--by his grandfather.
He's never had to risk anything of his own.''</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman knows that. He also knows that only results count. At
some point, the NFL will return to L.A., the nation's second-largest
media market. If it's Wasserman who makes this happen, he'll have
trumped the efforts of this city's most creative entertainment minds
who failed, including one Lew Wasserman.</TE>
<TE>   If he can't pull it off, he says he'll be just fine. ''My life is
not defined by the NFL being here. I have a lot of things I want to
do in my life. That's one of them. If it happens, great. If not, no
big deal. I don't need the NFL to be happy or successful.''</TE>

<HD>Copper Canyon thrill ride</HD>
<DH>Once you've arrived, the vistas are sensational, but the
Chihuahua al Pacifico railroad makes getting there half the fun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>El Fuerte, Mexico</LD>
<LD>   This peaceful colonial town on the route of the Chihuahua al
Pacifico Railroad is a good place to anticipate attractions. At the
hem of the western Sierra Madre, it is surrounded by mostly flat
farmland. The wide El Fuerte river flows languidly to the sea, and
the train tracks seem to go no place in particular.</LD>
<LD>   But if you're taking the train east, you know some amazing country
lies ahead: Mexico's Copper Canyon.</LD>
<TE>   It was 8 a.m. at the dusty El Fuerte train station, and kids were
running their racket, carrying bags for travelers whether their
services were wanted or not. A bull wandered onto the tracks, then
made way for a red and yellow engine.</TE>
<TE>   To me, an approaching train is one of the more exciting things in
the world, especially this one, the Chihuahua al Pacifico, otherwise
known as the Copper Canyon Railroad. It climbs into the heart of the
mountains from El Fuerte to the lumbering town of Creel, along the
rim of canyons deeper than the Grand, through 25,000 square miles
populated by the reclusive Tarahumara Indians.</TE>
<TE>   There are no paved highways or national park ranger stations, just
the railroad, which crosses a country so rough and lonely that train
was robbed four years ago by masked bandidos right out of "The Good,
the Bad and the Ugly."</TE>
<TE>   I boarded the train with friends I had made the night before, a
Florida grandma, Jane Richards, her daughter Gale and her 10-year-old
grandson, Sky. I took a seat on the right side of the train -- best
for the view, I'd heard -- tucked away my backpack and got ready to
be transported, in every sense of the word.</TE>
<TE>   From top to bottom</TE>
<TE>   Copper Canyon, or Barranca del Cobre, is at the top of many
travelers' wish lists, but few people actually make it here. The
wild, remote region in north-central Mexico gets about 25,000
tourists annually, compared with the 4.2 million who visited the
Grand Canyon in 2001. Most come with tour groups to take the
comfortable first-class train, which was bought from the government
four years ago by Ferromex, a private company.</TE>
<TE>   It would take a dozen hours to ride the train straight through
from El Fuerte to Chihuahua, so groups tend to get on and off,
staying in one of a chain of excellent Copper Canyon-area hotels
(with private baths, folkloric dance performances, purified water)
operated by the Mexican Balderrama company. There are tours to take
from the hotels and, in some cases, sterling views, leaving a trip
into the canyon an afterthought.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-nine percent of our passengers do not want to go into the
canyon," says Peter Robbins, founder of the Tucson-based Sierra Madre
Express, which takes visitors on weeklong excursions into Copper
Canyon on a special luxury train.</TE>
<TE>   But I wanted to stand at the bottom of the canyon, which isn't
just one canyon but half a dozen of them, riven into the sierra by
the Urique, Septentrion and Batopilas rivers, among others.</TE>
<TE>   On my independent seven-night trip last month, I started at the
Posada del Hidalgo, a charming Balderrama hotel in El Fuerte,
continued on the train, then headed about 5,900 feet down to the
hamlet of Batopilas by its river. This lost little Copper Canyon
mining town has created quite a buzz among backpackers in the last
decade. It is said to be beautiful and a tad dicey, surrounded by
back-country marijuana patches and reached from Creel by a harrowing,
hairpin-curving dirt road.</TE>
<TE>   The journey into Copper Canyon was schizophrenic, a little
luxurious, a little rough. I would be safe mostly and comfy like a
tour group traveler, but, as a woman traveling alone, I would
occasionally be exposed to adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Like a silver bracelet</TE>
<TE>   It took 100 years to lay the tracks of the Copper Canyon Railroad,
originally intended to link the U.S. heartland to the Gulf of
California. Sitting at my window or stationed in one of the open
passageways between cars, I could see why engineers had to blast 86
tunnels and build 175 bridges to get the train over the challenging
terrain.</TE>
<TE>   The coastal plains quickly gave way to foothills, then
pine-covered mountains, then a canyon gashed by the Septentrion
River, shining like a silver bracelet in a jewelry case thousands of
feet below.</TE>
<TE>   I started to think Copper Canyon couldn't compare with the Grand,
with its one vast chasm and variegated rocks. Around Temoris, about
60 miles northeast of El Fuerte, the scenery grew intense, and I
stopped comparing the Copper and the Grand because it was pointless.
Rock teeth lined the tops of the mountains all around, wispy clouds
caught between them.</TE>
<TE>   Then the train started doing nutty things, chugging up impossibly
steep inclines, passing through deadly dark tunnels and finally
mastering a set of hair-raising switchbacks at Temoris, a railway
village on the Septentrion.</TE>
<TE>   The train reached the highest points on the track, at 7,000 to
8,000 feet, in the early afternoon. By then I had met almost everyone
on board: honeymooners with their heads together in the seat in front
of me, a Mexican social worker on vacation, various tour groups and
guides whom I re-met on subsequent legs of the journey.</TE>
<TE>   I got off the train with almost everyone else at the Posada
Barrancas stop, an hour or so past Temoris, where there's a sleepy
village, Areponapuchi, and a bus to take travelers to the nearby
Posada Mirador Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   This rustic orange adobe lodge is the jewel in the Balderrama
crown. It's built in the canyon wall above the confluence of the
Urique and Tararecua rivers and delivers sweeping vistas from almost
every window, hearty family-style meals and guest rooms with
fireplaces, simple folksy furnishings and balconies overlooking the
canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Tarahumara women, dressed in their traditional bright printed
skirts, blouses and shawls, sat like flowers at the entrance to the
lodge, their baskets spread out in front of them. They barely respond
to a cheerful hola, underscoring the private nature of the
Tarahumara, who retreated into canyon nooks and crannies with each
successive wave of interloping conquistadors, Jesuits and miners. The
average tourist usually encounters them only at markets like this or
sees them along the road.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after arriving, I set out on a hike with the Richardses, a
Mexican couple from the capital, a guide named Felipe and a barefoot
Tarahumara girl about 5 years old who asked me for money in a
whisper. We went to a Tarahumara cave dwelling about 100 feet below
the rim, where a family still lived (and who requested donations from
tourists), then scrambled among the hoodoos at the rim of the canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Before dinner that night, Felipe played the guitar while
margaritas flowed freely and tour groups mingled. The sun sank, and I
went to sleep to the mad braying of a donkey.</TE>
<TE>   The next day it was back on the train to Creel, a 3 1/2-hour ride
across a pine-forested plateau, with the canyon hidden from view.
Halfway there, the train performed one last trick, crossing back over
its own tracks in a full loop.</TE>
<TE>   The view atop a van</TE>
<TE>   Creel is a ramshackle town of about 4,000 that grew up fast when a
highway reached it from Chihuahua around 20 years ago. But I stayed
only long enough to visit the craft shop on the plaza, which supports
a local hospital for the Tarahumara.</TE>
<TE>   I stayed that night at the 17-room Sierra Lodge in Cusarare, about
10 miles south of Creel, transported there from the train station by
the lodge van. Sierra Lodge is made of plaster, stone and logs and
has no electricity, but there are kerosene lamps. You'll also find
elegantly tiled showers, the kind of big, fluffy towels and bathrobes
you usually only get at a Ritz-Carlton and beds with blissfully soft
flannel sheets.</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon I walked about two miles from the hotel to Cusarare
Falls, still dribbling despite the drought. There I bought a carving
of a Tarahu- mara woman from a Tarahumara woman who had spread her
wares out on a rock. Both had implacable faces, like icons, I
thought.</TE>
<TE>   At dinner in the lodge I met Bill and Bea Martin, a Methodist
minister and his wife from Oklahoma. We decided to share the $275
cost of a Sierra Lodge van to take us round trip to Batopilas the
next morning.</TE>
<TE>   I stayed inside the van for the first 40 miles on paved highway,
passing farmsteads with cornfields and peach orchards. But when the
road turned to dirt at Samachique, Mario, the driver, persuaded me to
sit in one of the two seats affixed to the top. Switchbacking into
Batopilas Canyon with a 360-degree view, waving to kids on the road,
I was Queen Elizabeth II.</TE>
<TE>   It takes five hours to get to Batopilas. The road, which has
recently been upgraded, was better than I expected, passing mines,
like La Bufa, that made Batopilas a boomtown in the early 20th
century. To it, in 1880, came Alexander Shepherd, a former mayor of
Washington, his wife, retainers and seven children. Shepherd
prospered there for a time, mining silver and building aqueducts, a
clinic, an electric plant and an exquisite hacienda, now in
bougainvillea-coated ruins across the river from town.</TE>
<TE>   Batopilas has an air of abandonment and economic depression,
caused partly by the drought, partly by a dearth of tourists since
Sept. 11. Though fall was coming on, turning alders and poplars into
patches of orange and yellow, the heat of summer, which tends to be
intense at canyon bottom, hadn't yet broken. The cafes were shut down
when we arrived, so the only thing to do was to turn on the fan in my
room at the clean but basic Casa Real de las Minas near the plaza and
take a siesta.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the Martins and I ate dinner at Dona Mica, a block from the
hotel. Dona Mica, who became a mainstay for tourists by serving meals
on the front porch of her house, died recently. But her
daughter-in-law has carried on and produced for us cilantro-spiced
vegetable soup followed by carne asada.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning I set out on a dirt road by the river leading
about four miles south to the village of Satevo to visit the isolated
18th century Jesuit mission church there. Along the way, I saw scenes
from rural Mexican life: a woman washing dishes in her backyard,
naked kids swimming in the river, a boy in a green shirt sleeping on
a stone wall among huge organ pipe cactuses.</TE>
<TE>   Then the church came into view, with its classic white facade,
graceful three-tiered bell tower and Romanesque domes set like a
mirage against the copper-colored rock of the canyon in the middle of
nowhere. Though only a few families live in Satevo, the church is
well cared for, with paper flowers and primitive paintings on the
walls that look as though they might have been done by children.</TE>
<TE>   After seeing the inside, I sat with members of a tour group who
had come by van and offered me a ride back to Batopilas. But the walk
had been pleasant, so I declined.</TE>
<TE>   Sorrow and joy</TE>
<TE>   Halfway back to town, thinking all was right with the world, I
said hola to the boy in the green shirt on the stone wall, who looked
about 15. This time he ran down to the road and followed me, asking
for money. When I refused, he pulled a knife, saying he was a
bandido, quietly, as if he didn't quite believe it himself. I pushed
him away and felt his heart thumping in his chest, then started to
shriek. I guess he never expected a lone norte- americana to behave
like a banshee, because he did not follow when I took off. The
incident seemed to me more sad than dangerous. Still, I felt shaken
and reported it to the police in Batopilas.</TE>
<TE>   That night, my last in town, I joined a tour group also staying at
the Casa Real de las Minas, which had no restaurant, for a specially
catered dinner in the hotel's courtyard. Afterward a mariachi band
played for the tourists. Halfheartedly, I clapped and sang along to
"La Cucaracha."</TE>
<TE>   The trip out of the canyon was by van. Then I went west by train
to El Mision, another pleasant Balderrama hotel in the valley town of
Cerocahui, reached by dirt road from the railway station in
Bahuichivo, about halfway between Creel and El Fuerte.</TE>
<TE>   There I went riding with a guide to a waterfall at the edge of the
valley on a spirited horse named Dorado and visited the pretty church
across from the hotel. In the nearby plaza I could hear the piping
voices of little girls in the mission school down the road. I could
also smell marijuana burning.</TE>
<TE>   My room at the hotel opened onto a vineyard. I sat there in the
sun drying my hair the morning of my departure for El Fuerte, where I
stayed one last night before flying home.</TE>
<TE>   I had come to Mexico to see Copper Canyon, I thought. But some
trips turn out to be about much more than sightseeing. Some are
complex, with as much sorrow as joy. In a way, those are the best.</TE>

<HD>Old haunts in two Arizona ghost towns</HD>
<DH>The present is a whole lot quieter than the rip-roaring
past in the mining hamlets of Oatman and Chloride.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carla Henry</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chloride, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   Half an hour after leaving Laughlin, Nev., our car pulled into
this old ghost town. At the general store-visitor center, I read
about intriguing murals painted on granite cliffs to the east --
2,000 square feet of wildly colorful artistry in the stark Cerbat
Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   A shopkeeper said my new sedan would not survive the rutted dirt
road to the murals. But then my brother, Roger, met a loquacious
Chloride resident who said otherwise. Ruthie, decked out in baseball
cap, jeans and her late husband's pilot jacket, looked like an
old-timer who knew the lay of the land. "Just take it slow," she
said. And so we did.</LD>
<TE>   Had rain fallen recently, the drive would have been impossible
without four-wheel drive. But the weather was fine, the road dry. I
held the steering wheel tight, and into the Cerbat foothills we went.</TE>
<TE>   Ruthie had not led us astray. Soon Roger and I were looking at
"The Journey": yin and yang symbols, an Egyptian princess, serpents,
flames, celestial bodies and eagle's talons hovering over a mining
town. This was Nevada artist Roy Purcell's 1966 work about
self-discovery, painted on boulders not far from Indian petroglyphs.</TE>
<TE>   Ruthie, the mural, the petroglyphs -- at first Chloride had seemed
like a vision of eras past, but the town proved to be entertaining in
its present. I'm a ghost-town junkie, and, like an optimistic
gambler, I get excited every time I hit a jackpot like this. That's
why last February we chose Laughlin not as a gambling getaway but
merely as a convenient base for visiting Chloride and Oatman.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived at our Laughlin hotel on a Friday and were back on the
road at dawn Saturday, driving about 40 miles to Chloride. Route 68
took us east through 3,600-foot Union Pass in the Black Mountains.
The sun's glow amplified the golden yellow of the rock and carved
deep shadows in a surreal landscape. We turned north at U.S. 93 and
continued into town, tucked off the highway on Tennessee Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   At the Mineshaft general store and visitor center, the owner
directed us to the back room, which had historical photos and
pamphlets on town history. My favorite described a 1900 house fire
that Western writer Louis L'Amour and others tried to extinguish with
buckets. When the water ran out, L'Amour jumped off the roof and
yelled to let the house burn.</TE>
<TE>   Along Tennessee Avenue we passed Aggies Art Shack, a weathered
building housing art, jewelry and gifts. Outside lay rusty farm
implements, metal sculptures and any creation too large to fit
inside.</TE>
<TE>   We found much of Chloride -- home of painters, silversmiths,
leather craftsmen and other artists -- to be similarly eclectic and
artistic. Yards were decorated with junkyard-style monstrosities,
welded sculptures incorporating discards such as barbecue grills,
bicycle wheels, motorcycle gas tanks and bowling balls.</TE>
<TE>   Intrigued by antique coffeepots in the window, we wandered into
Parker's Custom Saddles Etc., the shop of George and Armetta Parker,
who design leather and rattlesnake products. The couple moved to
Chloride from Wisconsin eight years ago. Their store was full of
ambience, thanks to touches like the 120-year-old sewing machine that
the Parkers still use to make saddles and harnesses. (The couple have
since moved their shop to nearby Dolan Springs.) While George
repaired a saddle, Armetta stopped her leather tooling to chat and to
quote a price on a cowboy's coffeepot, which Roger bought for $20.</TE>
<TE>   We walked more side streets and admired historical buildings.
Arizona Central Bank, painted a friendly yellow, and the BFGoodrich
gas station, decked out in red and green and sporting two red pumps,
are well preserved. The Chloride post office, built in 1871, is
Arizona's oldest still in operation.</TE>
<TE>   The Chloride cemetery is striking, surrounded by hills, mining
mounds and desert scrub. We walked through, noting gravesites
ornately decorated with memorabilia left by loved ones: angel
statues, motorcycle parts, ceramic pigs.</TE>
<TE>   The soothing silence of the cemetery was in sharp contrast to
Laughlin. Ca-ching, ca-ching, coins in, arm down, repeat. I lost $10
almost as soon as we stepped inside our hotel, the Laughlin Flamingo.</TE>
<TE>   Roger's luck ran hot playing video poker. Taking pity on me, he
pushed over a handful of coins so I could play video blackjack near
him. After I lost his money, I was left watching an
Elvis-in-the-later-years impersonator on the lounge stage.</TE>
<TE>   The Flamingo diner's early-bird special one night, chicken and
pasta, was no culinary feat. The only thing worth bragging about was
the price: $1.99 per person.</TE>
<TE>   Our room ($49 plus tax per night) had two comfortable double beds
and a garden motif of green, red and pink -- an oasis in the desert.</TE>
<TE>   A town built on mining</TE>
<TE>   Our day trip to Oatman started with a drive to Kingman, where we
walked through the Powerhouse museum and visitor center, full of
Route 66 memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the highway took us though Sitgreaves Pass, a tortuous
route through ochre and sienna mountains. It's not for the
fainthearted. Roger and I likened it to a roller coaster.</TE>
<TE>   As Route 66 nears Oatman, the highway takes the name Gold Road,
which is appropriate, considering the abandoned mines that line the
way. Some are boarded up, but many have been left open. Old mines can
be dangerous inside, so we just stopped and took pictures.</TE>
<TE>   The mining frenzy started around 1900 with the Gold Road Mine east
of Oatman, staked by Jose Jerez and Henry Lovin. Their claims led to
extractions valued at about $2.25 million. Gold Road Mine was worked
intermittently during the last century, finally ceasing production in
1998. Today daily guided tours are offered year-round, leaving every
30 minutes from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. ([928] 768-1600, www.gold
roadmine.com).</TE>
<TE>   The town of Oatman sprang up with the Tom Reed Mine in 1904. As
others sprang up, the town grew.</TE>
<TE>   These days Oatman is a hoot. We caught the Oatman Ghost Riders,
who stage shootouts on Route 66. Cowboys start yelling, guns start
firing (blanks), the wounded fall to the road and the victor shouts
that bad guys never win. For couples planning on getting hitched on
Route 66, the Ghost Riders perform "Ol' West Shotgun Weddings" (www
.oatmanghostriders.com).</TE>
<TE>   We roamed the streets along with burros, descendants of the ones
prospectors used to haul supplies. Accustomed to being fed by
tourists, the burros brazenly stick their heads into car windows and
shopping bags.</TE>
<TE>   Oatman only has about 250 residents, but that number swells with
motorcyclists stopping on their way to or from Laughlin. Outside the
Sugar and Spicey Gift Shop, a sign reads: "Harley parking only,
violators will be terminated."</TE>
<TE>   The chamber of commerce holds an annual sidewalk egg-frying
contest, an event shunned by Laughlin boosters who don't like to
point out the scalding summer temperatures. Every Labor Day there's
the Burro Biscuit Toss. Contestants see how far they can throw the
"biscuits," gold-painted clumps of hay that -- how shall we say --
have already flown through a burro.</TE>
<TE>   We left Oatman on Route 66 and headed back to Laughlin. The trip
took only 40 minutes, so I had plenty of time for a cheap prime rib
dinner at the Edgewater Hotel and another chance to throw away cash
in the casinos.</TE>

<HD>Bali bombing proves the need to understand safety warnings</HD>
<DH>State Department announcements are a good start, but you
can find more up-to-date sources too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Engle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When they bombed paradise on Oct. 12, nearly everyone was surprised
-- except, perhaps, those who had carefully read the travel safety
announcements issued by the U.S. State Department.</LD>
<LD>   A nearly year-old warning urging Americans to "defer nonessential
travel to Indonesia" was still in effect when blasts, thought to be
the work of terrorists, tore through nightclubs crowded with
foreigners in Bali, Indonesia's best-known resort island. More than
180 people, including at least two Americans, died, and hundreds were
injured.</LD>
<LD>   With the Bali bombing, "the rules have changed" on avoiding
trouble abroad, says Issy Boim, president of Air Security
International, a travel security company. "Today there are no safe
havens. You have to take precautions everywhere."</LD>
<TE>   These days it's more important than ever for travelers to arm
themselves with current information. But because of rapid changes in
the world situation, that's no easy task, even for travel
professionals. Several said they were unaware of any warning
affecting Bali before the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Bali warning points to the subtleties of State Department
safety directives and the usefulness of tapping other sources. Here
are some steps travelers can take to stay informed:</TE>
<TE>   Check all announcements: Besides issuing the November 2001 warning
that urged Americans to avoid travel to Indonesia, the State
Department, two days before the Oct. 12 bombing, renewed its
worldwide caution on terrorism. That caution advised traveling U.S.
citizens to avoid "facilities where Americans are generally known to
congregate or visit, such as clubs, restaurants, places of worship,
schools or outdoor recreation events." Similar wording had been used
since March 17 in these announcements.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, the Indonesia and worldwide statements said, in
effect: Don't go to a club in Bali frequented by Americans. But you
had to read both to get the full picture.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department posts travel information in three categories
on its Internet site www.travel.state.gov. "Travel warnings" urge
Americans to avoid travel to a certain country. "Public
announcements" stop short of that but advise of short-term or
worldwide risks from coups, terrorism or other conditions. "Consular
information sheets" are general briefings on countries; many contain
safety information too.</TE>
<TE>   The department also maintains a toll-free phone number, (888)
407-4747, for such information. The phone is answered 5 a.m. to 5
p.m. Pacific time Monday through Friday, except federal holidays. It
also has a fax-back service at (202) 647-3000.</TE>
<TE>   Brush up on geography: To discern that there was a travel warning
affecting Bali, you had to know that it is in Indonesia; the
statement didn't mention Bali specifically. That can pose a problem
for those whose knowledge of geography is lacking.</TE>
<TE>   Kathryn Sudeikis, national vice president of the American Society
of Travel Agents and an agent at All About Travel in Mission, Kan.,
says clients sending their children to Austria after the bombings
asked her, "Where is Bali in relation to this?"</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Indonesia warning noted there had been violent incidents
in Aceh, Irian Jaya and South Sulawesi provinces, hardly household
names. Some of these areas are less than 400 miles from Bali, about
the distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In this situation, an atlas is your best friend.</TE>
<TE>   Read between the lines: What's not said can be as important as
what is said.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 1, 2000, the State Department issued a travel warning on
Indonesia that dropped a previous statement declaring that "major
tourist destinations in Bali, parts of Sumatra and North Sulawesi
have been relatively calm." Bali also wasn't mentioned by name in the
November 2001 travel warning, which was still in effect on Oct. 12.</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to address that all of Indonesia might be a
problem," says Stuart Patt, spokesman for the State Department's
Bureau of Consular Affairs. "We should not be trying to ... create
the impression that particular places are safe."</TE>
<TE>   But some travel professionals drew the opposite conclusion: No
news was good news.</TE>
<TE>   Fenina Mundisugih, owner of Natrabu Travel in San Francisco, which
sends about 1,000 people to Bali each year, said he had understood
that Bali was excluded from warnings.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department's consular information sheet on Indonesia, a
separate document, had continued to carry this statement: "The
tourist destination of Bali has been largely free of the disturbances
seen in other parts of Indonesia. All tourist facilities are
operating normally, and to date foreigners have not been the specific
target of any group."</TE>
<TE>   Don't get desensitized: Travel warnings have become so pervasive
that we ignore them, many experts say.</TE>
<TE>   As of Oct. 18, the State Department had warnings or public
announcements in effect for 38 countries, or nearly a fifth of the
more than 200 it monitors, plus the worldwide caution. The caution,
advising Americans to remain vigilant everywhere because of terrorist
threats, has been in effect "more or less" continually for about
three years, Patt says.</TE>
<TE>   Worldwide cautions are "not to be taken lightly," Patt says. "We
have to remind people it's a dangerous world out there."</TE>
<TE>   Look elsewhere for current news: A week after the Oct. 12
bombings, which were followed by several State Department travel
warnings referring to them, the department's consular information
sheet on Indonesia, dating to Aug. 10, 2001, still said Bali was
largely free of disturbances and that "foreigners have not been the
specific target of any group."</TE>
<TE>   That oversight points to a weakness in State Department travel
information, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "They're valuable, but not exactly breaking news," travel agent
Sudeikis says of the reports. For daily updates on security and other
travel issues, she and other professionals consult various sources.
Some of these services are out of reach for many tourists because
annual subscriptions cost hundreds of dollars. They include Weismann
Travel Reports' Intelliguide, www.weissmann.com ($995 a year) and
Travel Management Daily, www.tmdaily.com ($797 a year; aimed at
travel agents).</TE>
<TE>   Computer-savvy travelers can tap some useful sources at low or no
cost. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   Overseas Security Advisory Council: This organization provides
security updates to about 2,100 U.S. business and other private
groups, such as churches and nonprofits. It has a staff of 15 in
Washington, D.C., says Andy Laine, spokesman for the State
Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Many of the council's
services are available only to members; you must be a business with
overseas interests to qualify. But anyone can view its daily reports
on political violence, weather emergencies, labor strikes and more,
listed alphabetically by country, on www.ds-osac.org. (Click on
"Global News.")</TE>
<TE>   CNN: Call up the CNN Web site, www.cnn.com, and type in your
destination's name to view the day's news, plus archives. You may
have to slog through several unrelated items, but the service is
free.</TE>
<TE>   Air Security International: Several hundred corporations,
typically paying nearly $5,000 per year, subscribe to the World Watch
service of this 13-year-old travel security company based in Houston,
says President Issy Boim, a former officer with Israel's security
services. But by going to www.airsecurity.com and clicking on "Hot
Spots" and then "Current Issue," you can view daily reports free.
Violence, weather and other events are organized by region and rated
by their "threat level" to travelers. (For analysis of the reports
and other services, you have to subscribe.) Boim has considered
charging to view the reports but has no immediate plan to do so.</TE>
<TE>   iJET Travel Intelligence: This 3-year-old risk-management company,
www.ijet.com, based in Annapolis, Md., and used by many travel
agents, has begun selling its services to individuals. For $25 per
trip, you get around-the-clock updates by e-mail or phone, plus
access to a Web site customized with information on your
destinations. Often the updates include advice on how to overcome the
problem, such as alternate routes in the event of a transit strike or
a road blockage. The service includes access to country profiles of
up to 100 pages, with details on political violence, crime, health
and more. (These can also be downloaded for $8 each from iJET's Web
site or from www.amazon.com; search for "iJET.")</TE>
<TE>   Security experts I spoke with agree on this: They can't predict
the future. None claimed to have had any intelligence pointing
specifically to Bali as a likely target.</TE>
<TE>   Many do suggest that in a new, more dangerous world, the most
reliable ways to avoid being a terrorist target are to keep a low
profile wherever you are and to shun places where crowds of foreign
tourists gather.</TE>
<TE>   And meanwhile, of course, keep abreast of the latest news about
your destination.</TE>

<LD>Amtrak ending guarantee plan after two years</LD>
<LD>   Call it the little guarantee that couldn't.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Amtrak will end its "service promise" program that
gives vouchers, good toward future trips, to dissatisfied customers.</LD>
<TE>   The program was introduced in July 2000 by former Amtrak President
George Warrington, who said it would help counter the railroad's
reputation as "tired, worn-out and complacent."</TE>
<TE>   But Amtrak never reached its goal of holding reimbursement
requests to 1 per 1,000 passengers. Instead the requests were running
about 4 per 1,000 in the fiscal year that ended in September,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We found that most of the certificates we were issuing resulted
from factors outside Amtrak's control -- things like delays on the
freight railroads or weather-related delays," said spokesman Dan
Stessel.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak owns about 3% of the tracks it uses; the rest are
controlled by freight railroads.</TE>
<TE>   Stessel said Amtrak would continue to review complaints on a
case-by-case basis.</TE>

<TE>   Cruise ships pass up Bali after club bombings</TE>
<TE>   Cruise lines are rerouting ships away from Indonesia as the
fallout continues from the Oct. 12 bombing that killed scores of
tourists, including at least two Americans, in the nightclub district
on Bali.</TE>
<TE>   The Regal Princess, which embarks on a 19-day sail from Bangkok,
Thailand, to Sydney, Australia, on Nov. 26, will call in Kuala Lumpur
and Penang in Malaysia rather than Bali and Semarang, Indonesia,
according to Princess Cruises. Holland America Line is canceling
stops in Indonesia on its Volendam and Prinsendam ships through Nov.
6; alternate ports had not been announced as of the Travel section's
press time Tuesday. Qantas, Australia's national flag carrier, said
it would cancel two of its four weekly flights from Sydney to the
Balinese capital, Denpasar, wire services reported.</TE>
<TE>   In Jakarta, the U.S. Embassy urged Americans in Indonesia to avoid

<TE>   Rummaging through hotel rooms of fantasy</TE>
<TE>   "Unrealistic. Speculative. Provocative."</TE>
<TE>   That's how curator Donald Albrecht describes an unusual exhibit
opening Tuesday at the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt, National Design
Museum in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Hotels for Global Nomads" muses on the sociology of lodgings.
Using photos, videos and room installations, it looks at how hotels
"fuel fantasy" and blur the boundary between home and office, public
and private, Albrecht says.</TE>
<TE>   Some hotels in the exhibit are real, such as Dubai's striking,
sail-shaped Burj al-Arab and Japan's bizarre capsule hotels, where
guests pile into tiny rooms that resemble enclosed bunk beds.</TE>
<TE>   The room keys to others exist only in the mind. A "Lunatic Hotel"
sits on the moon. A "24/7 Hotel Room" for business travelers is a
temporary office and home, with private pool. Toland Grinnell's
"Private Dancer" is described as "a travel trunk that opens into a
personal discotheque suitable for a hotel room."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit ends March 2. Adult admission is $8. The museum, at 2
E. 91st St., is open daily except Mondays and federal holidays; hours
vary. (212) 849-8400, www.si.edu/ndm.</TE>
<TE>   DEAL OF THE WEEK: Waikiki Beach at $159 per night</TE>

<HD>Behind the veil at Shangri La</HD>
<DH>Built in extravagant Islamic style, Doris Duke's 1930s
Hawaii estate will soon be open for public tours.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michele Kayal</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Honolulu</DL>
<LD>A single, jagged hole in the wall of the dining-room entryway
bespeaks Doris Duke's devotion to Shangri La, a lavish, five-acre
Islamic-style estate she built near Honolulu's Diamond Head. The
tobacco heiress, who died in 1993, was awaiting just the right tile
for that particular spot. She never found it.</LD>
<LD>   Shangri La, which has been seldom seen, even in photographs, since
it was finished in the late '30s, will offer its first public tours
Nov. 6. The living room's glittering 13th century mihrab, the dining
room's tent-like interior, the exuberant Turkish Room with its
geometric fountain and Ottoman-era ceramics and the backyard
"playhouse" modeled on a 17th century Iranian pavilion create the
impression of a grand Middle Eastern palace.</LD>
<LD>   The grandeur sometimes obscures the spectacular individual pieces
in Duke's varied collection: Syrian chests inlaid with mother of
pearl, ceramics from Moorish Spain, painted Moroccan ceilings,
filigreed brass lamps from Egypt.</LD>
<TE>   But what's never lost is that Shangri La was a home. It's easy to
imagine flopping down on the living room's wide-wale corduroy
sectional or watering the courtyard's multicolored bougainvillea,
kept in black plastic pots, just as Duke left them.</TE>
<TE>   Six daily tours, offered Wednesday through Saturday, are limited
to 12 people each. They begin at the Honolulu Academy of Arts'
refurbished gallery of Islamic art. Tickets are $25; reservations are
required. Call (866) 385-3849 or visit www.honoluluacademy.org.
(Children under 12 are not admitted.)</TE>
<TE>   Shangri La is not the only new enticement for Honolulu art hounds.
The Hawaii State Art Museum will open Nov. 3 at 250 S. Hotel St.,
across from the Capitol, as the permanent venue for the state's
5,000-piece collection by local artists.</TE>
<TE>   The 12,000 square feet of gallery space will take on themes such
as Hawaii's heritage, ethnic cultures and natural surroundings.
Throughout the exhibits, the artwork, dating mostly from the 1960s to
the present, draws on Western aesthetics, Hawaiian folk traditions
and ethnically diverse sensibilities. They represent nearly 300
artists, including Tadashi Sato, John Young, Pegge Hopper and Herb
Kane.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1967, when it passed a law setting aside construction funds
for art in public places, the state has spent $4.5 million gathering
the work, organizers say.</TE>
<TE>   Museum hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. It
will normally be closed Sunday and Monday and holidays, but will be
open Nov. 3, its inaugural day. Admission is free; on Nov. 3, there
will be free, timed tickets.</TE>
<TE>   An opening-day festival will feature free live music, dance and
hands-on art activities throughout the Capitol district, plus free
admission to nearly a dozen museums from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. A
trolley will run between the sites and can be picked up at 12 stops.
For information, call (808) 586-0900 or visit www.state.hi.us/sfca.</TE>

<KH>HER WORLD</KH>
<HD>The frill in flying is the ease of low-cost airlines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sniping at the airlines seems to be a national pastime. But I refrain
when it comes to the low-cost carriers, such as JetBlue, Southwest,
Spirit, ATA, AirTran, Frontier, National, Midwest Express and America
West. They make me want to go places I never considered, just because
the price is right.</LD>
<LD>   While the airlines duke it out for passengers, I'm pleased to snap
up plane tickets to Las Vegas or the Bay Area for the price of a
massage. Suddenly, flying seems easier and more interesting. I can
travel on the spur of the moment because several discount airlines,
including ATA (American Trans Air) and JetBlue Airways, offer
last-minute fares that are almost as inexpensive as 21-day advance
purchase fares. At last, thanks to the little guys, one-way tickets
can be affordable. (How the majors ever got away with charging full
round-trip fares for one-way tickets I never will know.)</LD>
<LD>   Flying on the low-cost carriers has introduced me to the pleasures
of secondary airports -- Ontario, Burbank and Oakland -- that many of
the smaller airlines use. I actually enjoy spending time at Long
Beach Airport, endearingly dinky, uncongested and retro.</LD>
<TE>   It seems easier to get help and attention precisely because the
low-cost airlines are small. Last summer, when I needed to go to
Washington, D.C., because of a death in the family, JetBlue quoted a
price that was about $100 less than the price of a walk-up, though
the airline had no standard discount prices for bereavement travel.</TE>
<TE>   "The budget airlines have better customer service because they're
smaller and trying harder," says Bob Kern, president of the Southern
California chapter of the American Society of Travel Agents.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, the smaller low-cost airlines often give consumers more
choices. Gone are the days when I stuck with just one major carrier
to accumulate frequent-flier miles. Now I like to fly around, getting
to know a variety of budget carriers. Because I don't expect as much
of them as I do of the majors, I'm pleased with whatever I get.</TE>
<TE>   And no two low-cost airlines are exactly alike. "Every one has a
different flavor," says Ed Stewart, a spokesman for Southwest
Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest, JetBlue, National Airlines and Spirit Airlines are
generally lumped together in the low-cost heap. But among even these
four airlines there are telling differences.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest, which started flying in 1971 between Dallas, Houston
and San Antonio, is the model of a low-cost, no-frills airline. It
doesn't offer meals or first and business class. Good cheer, if not
assiduous service, can be expected of flight attendants. Longer trips
usually require connections, and there's no reserved seating.</TE>
<TE>   The cattle car approach depresses some travelers. But Southwest
has so many flights on popular routes that travelers often can just
go to the airport and catch a flight, knowing that if they miss one
plane another probably will depart soon enough. Others who might
drive or take a train for short hauls have found it cheaper to fly
Southwest, says Michael Allen of Back Aviation Solutions, an airline
consulting firm in New Haven, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue, with headquarters at John F. Kennedy International
Airport in New York, put a new twist on the budget airline formula
when it started up two years ago. The idea was to offer the same low
fares as Southwest with a few more flourishes. These include new
planes (Airbus A320s), a little more legroom and free live satellite
TV. And then there are the little things: reserved seating; ramps at
the rear and front of the aircraft to speed boarding and deplaning;
beverages and snacks served by flight attendants using trays or
baskets instead of carts to keep the aisles clear.</TE>
<TE>   Spirit Airlines, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., flies cross-country
from L.A., Las Vegas and Oakland for as little as $218 round trip and
is like Southwest in many respects. But in August it added an
upgraded coach class, Spirit Plus, for travelers who want a few
amenities, four-across leather seating and priority boarding. The
service costs 20% to 30% more than coach, and last-minute upgrades to
Spirit Plus are just $40 when available.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly for a budget carrier, Las Vegas-based National tries
to make comfort and service standard. The airline is currently in
Chapter 11 (though National spokesman Dik Shimizu thinks it will be
out of bankruptcy reorganization by mid-November). Until last year,
hot meals were served on china in coach, though hard times since
Sept. 11 have forced National to discontinue that.</TE>
<TE>   National's advance-purchase fares for transcontinental flights
(all of which stop in Las Vegas) might not take your breath away. But
its last-minute walk-up fares for first class (with china) are less
than half the price of first class on the majors. And there's no
extra charge for adding a stop in Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, flying is almost fun again. I can occasionally afford
first class. I can go on a whim without breaking the bank. And, most
revolutionary, I can speak of the airlines, especially the low-cost
ones, without snarling.</TE>

<HD>A trek to hidden troves of rock art</HD>
<DH>A camping trip into the rugged Sierra de San Francisco
gives tantalizing glimpses of an ancient civilization through its
art.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Ekegren Travis</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sierra de San Francisco, Mexico</LD>
<LD>   THE air was clear and fresh. Heat from the sun radiated from
volcanic rubble, intensifying a midday temperature in the high 70s.
Some nights were mild; some were frigid. But always, as the winter
light waned, a concert began. Doves sang plaintive songs from the red
willows or palms that lined the pools. Frogs started croaky calls, so
loud at times that our tent vibrated in the echoes. Owls occasionally
swooped up the canyon, hooting softly. Seldom was there silence.</LD>
<LD>   My husband, Charles, and I had come to this remote part of central
Baja California, about 140 miles southeast of Guerrero Negro, last
January to see rock art. Primitive art can be found throughout the
Baja Peninsula, but the mountains and canyons of the Sierra de San
Francisco are so peppered with paintings, pictographs and petroglyphs
-- some as much as 4,000 years old -- that the U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization designated the area a World
Heritage Site in 1993. Jean Clottes, a French authority on
prehistoric art and one of our group, called the rock art of Baja
California among "the greatest in the world."</LD>
<TE>   Its origins are a puzzle. No one can say who the artists were or
where they came from. They left little trace of themselves, except
for their drawings and carvings. "They testify to the beliefs and
ceremonies of long-gone Indian tribes," Clottes said. "Several of
their characteristics made me think of much older art in the French
and Spanish caves: the rarity of scenes, the use of natural reliefs
to draw some animals or humans, the superimpositions, the way some
animals were painted as though they issued from the walls."</TE>
<TE>   We found exquisitely simple paintings of men and animals in caves
and shelters, and delicately chiseled figures of fish and birds, men
and deer in petroglyphs scattered on promontories and near rocky
stream beds. We marveled at the massive size of some and the
sophistication of many. Most were painted in red and black, but a few
figures were drawn in white or yellow-orange, and we found chunks of
chalky stone and a soft yellowish rock the artists may have used. We
wondered at the meaning of the pierced figures at the Cave of Arrows
and the white lines that resembled a musical score at Music Cave. I
lost count of the number of sites we saw during our two-week trip,
but Clottes jotted notes on about 50.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the sites at Altamira, Spain, and Lascaux, France, which
are closed to the public, the rock art in the Sierra de San Francisco
is accessible to all with permits from the Mexican government.</TE>
<TE>   But many sites are difficult to reach. We traveled by mule and on
foot into the tortuous volcanic landscape, led by guides appointed by
the Mexican government. Guides are not only required, they are
essential: They know the location of the art and the best paths to
it.</TE>
<TE>   Charles and I were part of a tour led by Andy Schouten, an amateur
archeologist who is probably more familiar with the area than any
other norteamericano. Several times a year he sets up medical clinics
in the village of San Francisco. Timed to coincide with a visit by
Clottes, our trip was to be solely an exploration of prehistoric art
sites. In our group were Clottes and Schouten; Clottes'
brother-in-law, Guy Caussanel; Mary Gorden and her husband, James,
president of the Southern Sierra Archaeological Society; Charles, an
amateur geologist; and me, an enthusiast of all but an expert in
nothing. We had committed ourselves to 14 days of camping and hiking
in the rugged Sierra de San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Picking up permits</TE>
<TE>   The village of San Francisco, which has one telephone, a church, a
school, a market and a bar, is two hard days of driving south from
San Diego and 23 miles northwest of San Ignacio at the end of an
unpaved precipitous road. But we were prepared: Our caravan consisted
of two sturdy SUVs and a four-wheel-drive pickup. And, in case of
trouble, we carried tools, tire repair kits, spare parts, extra fuel
and short-range radios.</TE>
<TE>   The day before, we had stopped at the Mexican government's
National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) in San Ignacio
to pick up permits and hire guides, then backtracked to San
Francisco, where six guides, including one from INAH, were waiting.
Because we had archeologists among us, we qualified for a "level
four" permit, giving us access to remote and sensitive rock art sites
usually off-limits to the public. But a level one permit, which
anyone can get without advance notice, allows entrance to easily
accessible sites in San Francisco or Santa Martha, and a level two
lets visitors into Canyon Santa Teresa and Arroyo del Parral, which
aren't hard to reach.</TE>
<TE>   Near San Francisco is Palo Rayo, a wind-swept mesa that was home
to some of our six Baja guides, among them Manuel Arce Arce; Miguel
Angel Ojeda Rojas and his 13-year-old nephew, Ricardo Guadalupe Ojeda
Lere, an apprentice guide now that he had completed the sixth grade;
and Ramon Arce Arce of INAH.</TE>
<TE>   We spent our first evening in Manuel's efficient but humble
kitchen. Walls were made from old boxes and boards; the dirt floor
was well trampled. Dinner was as simple as the surroundings, but
delicious. Potatoes and onion filled a pan with bits of dried meat.
The mixture was served first to us, then to family, along with beans,
salad and tortillas made by Manuel's wife, Juana. Everything was
carefully prepared, so I had no worries about stomach ailments.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner we set up camp a short distance from the pigs, goats,
burros and mules. The wind blew ominously throughout the night,
making me worry about what was ahead.</TE>
<TE>   At daybreak we gathered our gear, the children watching intently,
and left it in piles for the guides to load onto the 15 burros we
needed. Next, we were assigned mules to ride.</TE>
<TE>   About 11 a.m., when we rode off toward the canyon rim, I got my
first glimpse of the landscape we would inhabit for the next 14 days.
Canyon San Pablo is about 2,500 feet deep, a miniature version of the
Grand Canyon, and as challenging in descent. Boulders the size of
small houses littered the canyon floor; slick volcanic flows lined
the narrow trail. And everywhere there was cactus: cholla, ocotillo,
nopal, red-tinged barrel cactus and huge, tough cardon, which is used
to build walls and is made into a fibrous rope.</TE>
<TE>   San Pablo is home to Pintata Cave, which stretches 500 feet, with
a narrow mouth of volcanic rock. A mural at the far end of the cave
reaches skyward, with many figures 20 to 30 feet above the floor. The
primitive artists showed a surprising sophistication in perspective,
painting figures of men, women and animals in massive proportions.
Smaller figures are near the floor.</TE>
<TE>   The canyon is rich with rock art. Some images are tiny, some huge,
some alone, but in many cases figures from different periods are
overlaid, resulting in a large, complex mural. Each day we visited
sites until it seemed we had scoured the landscape for rock art. Our
daily excursions took us over the canyon bottom, littered with
gigantic boulders and palm fronds sharp as a rake, and up steep,
slippery walls on narrow goat trails too perilously close to the
cactus for my comfort.</TE>
<TE>   Charles and I have tramped hundreds of miles on many rough trails
in the Sierra Nevada in California and in the mountains of Europe,
Peru and Patagonia, but none of those compared to the toughness of
the Sierra de San Francisco. The toe of my boot was ripped to shreds
on the coarse volcanic stone, requiring a quick fix with red duct
tape. After a strenuous day, camp, as basic as it was, was a haven of
good food and conversation. Our evenings began by lightening the load
in the wine box, then firing up the two Coleman stoves. The Gordens
did most of the cooking, creating great meals from the limited
supplies of Juana's tortillas, potatoes, onions, chicken and beef.
Almost every night we had cabbage salad.</TE>
<TE>   Water was scarce and had to be pumped and filtered from the
trickle that flowed along the canyon floor. Warm water was such a
luxury that I looked forward to washing dishes in hot soapsuds.
Bathing was possible only at the nearest ranch. There, enclosed in a
"bathhouse" built of cardon or palm, and with a bucket of water at my
feet, I washed away the dust and grime, one arm and foot at a time.</TE>
<TE>   We returned to Palo Rayo to restock for our next week in Arroyo
San Gregorio. While supplies were sorted, we took side trips to see
more art. I spotted my favorite petroglyph at Rancho Santa Ana, a
site strewn with hundreds of carved and chiseled figures: a delicate,
small deer carefully pecked into the stone with a fine instrument.</TE>
<TE>   Marine life and a family tableau</TE>
<TE>   We left for Arroyo San Gregorio, traveling east with two new
guides. All the guides took care of us as if we were their children,
carrying heavy gear on day hikes, guarding our safety and making sure
our mules behaved.</TE>
<TE>   My mount, Carbonero, was not only independent, he was also too
smart for his own good. He would figure out his own routes on steep
descents, ignoring commands. He could jump up onto a ledge when the
trail was too steep for an easy climb. Besides, he was shiny and
black and knew he was handsome.</TE>
<TE>   We reached Rancho San Gregorio in the late afternoon and set up
camp beneath orange trees in an orchard owned by ranchers whose
families have held this land for 114 years.</TE>
<TE>   The art was abundant at San Gregorio. We saw a series of caves
named for the ranch, San Gregorio I, II and III. In the first, a
painting stretched for 60 feet above us. It appeared to be the work
of a single artist, but in fact the mural had been painted over time,
with each anonymous artist expanding and adding to the original.</TE>
<TE>   At La Palma Cave we saw "The Family of Man," a grouping of men,
women and a child, each painted half red and half black. Wherever we
looked in caves and shelters, we found whales, mantas and turtles
inspired by the Gulf of California, 20 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the second week we had run out of red wine and were
depleting our stores of white, a sure signal it was time to leave. We
had seen an amazing gallery of art in this remote place. By the time
we saddled up, I began to regret our departure.</TE>

<TE>   Adventure in Sierra de San Francisco</TE>
<TE>   GETTING THERE:</TE>
<TE>   By car: Driving in the Sierra de San Francisco requires a
high-clearance vehicle; off Highway 1, most roads are dirt. Carry
current vehicle registration, proof of ownership and insurance
specifically for driving in Mexico. Coverage starts at about $10 per
day. Check with your auto insurance company or AAA, which also sells
insurance valid in Mexico. We bought policies from Discover Baja;
(800) 727-2252.</TE>
<TE>   A tourist card ($20) is required in Mexico. Forms may be available
from your insurer or at the border.</TE>
<TE>   VISITING THE SITES:</TE>
<TE>   To visit rock art sites, contact the office of the Instituto
Nacional de Antropologia e Historia (telephone/fax
011-52-61515-40222, www.inah.gob.mx), next to the church in San
Ignacio. Open 8 a.m.- 6 p.m. daily Nov. 1-May 1, 8 a.m.-3 p.m.
Tuesday-Saturday the remainder of the year. (They speak only Spanish
at the office.)</TE>
<TE>   There are three levels of permits: With level one, you may not
have to make arrangements beforehand, but a local guide must be
available. Level two permits include sites in the Canyon de Santa
Teresa or Arroyo del Parral, which require a brief trip by mule or on
foot. To view level three sites, you must notify INAH six months in
advance, and local guides and an INAH guide must go along. These
trips take at least five to seven days with full pack arrangements,
including one mule and one burro per person. Per-day cost is about
$14 for each guide and $11 for each animal. Meals are $10 to $15 per
person, depending on the menu. You must include food for the guides.
Registration fees are $3.85 to visit the caves (which is waived if
you are 60 or older) and $3 per day to use a camera, to be paid at an
INAH office.</TE>

<LD>South American Handbook 2003, Ben Box, Footprint Handbooks Ltd.,
$39.95</LD>
<LD>   Look in the corner of this guidebook's cover and you'll see a rare
thing: "79th Edition." And behind that number lies a tale.</LD>
<LD>   Before Tony and Maureen Wheeler conceived the Lonely Planet
guidebooks, before Harvard students cranked up their Let's Go
franchise, before Arthur Frommer started scribbling for the benefit
of American skinflints in Europe, the "South American Handbook" was a
part of the traveler's landscape. It was known for such brisk,
unvarnished intelligence as: "Carnival in Cusco [Peru] is a messy
affair with flour, water, cacti, bad fruit and animal manure thrown
about in the streets." (It's on page 1,233 in the new edition.)</LD>
<TE>   This book's English publishers have been issuing new editions
since 1924. And for nearly that long, old South America hands have
been recommending them to newcomers contemplating travel to that
continent.</TE>
<TE>   In its current form, the book features some traits every guidebook
should copy. For instance, a strong binding and extraordinarily thin
paper make this edition's 1,564 pages a tad slimmer than my 952-page
paperback dictionary. But it does have one trait that I wish all
guidebook publishers would forswear: paid ads, sprinkled liberally.</TE>
<TE>   Footprint, the book's publisher, now has 80 other guidebooks. I've
not tested any but its old standby, in which I found comforting
results.</TE>
<TE>   The Explora Lodge in Chile's Torres del Paine National Park is,
indeed, an "ugly building but luxurious and comfortable." The climb
up Huayna Picchu, the peak that overlooks Machu Picchu in Peru, is in
fact narrow, perilous in wet weather and a bad idea for anyone with
acrophobia. Physical descriptions of half a dozen lodgings, from
Gringo Bill's in Aguascalientes, Peru, to the Inca Utama Hotel on the
Bolivian side of Lake Titicaca, match my memories.</TE>
<TE>   The whole book teems with helpful details, especially in its
unflinching descriptions of budget lodgings. Here's a measure of its
backpacker-friendliness: In a quick categorization of lodgings, the
guide takes care to distinguish among the $12-to-$20 places, the
$7-to-$11 places, the $4-to-$6 places and (shiver) the $3-and-under
places.</TE>
<TE>   The only error I could find was in the background entries, which
say both Uruguay and Paraguay measure precisely 406,752 square
kilometers. (Other sources put Uruguay at 176,000.)</TE>
<TE>   Though scores of collaborators and correspondents contribute to
each edition, much credit must go to author Box, who claims a
doctorate in Spanish and Portuguese studies from London University,
started as an underling on the guidebook in 1980 and rose to become
its top editor in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   It is a shame about the ads, though. With their knowing asides
about the going rate of home-brewed maize liquor, Box and company win
a traveler's trust easily enough. But when you read their editorial
endorsement of the Hotel Oberland in La Paz and then you notice the
advertisement for the same hotel just 2 inches below, you have to
sigh.</TE>

<TE>   Perfect pictures but purple prose on Hispanic America</TE>
<TE>   America Latina, Text by Fabienne Rousso-Lenoir, Assouline
Publishing Inc., $50</TE>
<TE>   THIS is a coffee-table book with poker-faced Frida Kahlo on its
cover and a hemisphere of frustrating possibilities inside. It takes
as its subject every Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking country in the
Americas. To evoke them, the editors use a brilliant range of current
color and black-and-white photos, along with historic documents,
paintings and other choice images.</TE>
<TE>   The words are less exhilarating. Arranged in nine thematic
sections, the book features essays on topics from the bossa nova to
Che Guevara. But Rousso-Lenoir's language is so high-flown that the
reader -- well, this reader -- soon grows cranky. For example: "It
was the goldsmith who discovered these dreams of the sun first in the
dark rock in which he managed to distinguish the shiny metal."</TE>
<TE>   Pictures nearly perfect, prose too purple.</TE>

<TE>   An area code's worth of pictures</TE>
<TE>   212 Views of Central Park: Experiencing New York's Jewel From
Every Angle, Photographs by Mick Hales, text by Sandee Brawarsky
Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, $35</TE>
<TE>   Inside these covers you'll find a Big Apple valentine, thoroughly
illustrated and filled with data-rich captions and sunny accounts of
park history. The idea of 212 images is simply an area code-driven
gimmick (so next we can count on a 909-shot salute to Riverside,
right?), and ever-proliferating area codes have already begun to make
it obsolete. But to celebrate some of the best-loved acreage in North
America, how much excuse do you need?</TE>

<LD>We're about to enter November, which means we have reached the
beginning of the five-month off-season in transatlantic travel. This
year, off-season vacation prices to Europe are so low that, short of
an outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East, they should get people
moving. Here are the leading programs today.</LD>
<LD>   Ireland: The most surprising air-and-land package is to Ireland.
For $399, you get not only the round-trip flight from Los Angeles but
also a rental car and accommodations. This trip, offered by Sceptre
Ireland, (800) 221-0924, www.sceptreireland.com, includes flights on
Aer Lingus into Shannon, seven days' use of a rental car with
unlimited mileage and vouchers for six nights' accommodations in a
network of 450 farmhouse B&amp;Bs. Irish breakfasts are included.
Travelers spend their first night in Limerick's Best Western Two Mile
Inn. The $399 rate is valid from Nov. 15 to Dec. 17. The price
increases to $499 from Dec. 27 to March 9.</LD>
<TE>   London: The top lure for London is $549 per person for a six-night
air-and-hotel package. November through March, Go-To day.com, (425)
487-9632, www.go-today.com, offers this unheard-of rate for
round-trip air on United Airlines from LAX and six nights with
breakfast at a London hotel. The price is for Tuesday and Wednesday
departures only. (Other days are $599.) Lodging is in any of several
hotels in the popular Bayswater and Earl's Court districts.
Additional nights: $30.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the same London packages at OffPeakTraveler .com start
at $569 on Virgin Atlantic from Los Angeles, Dec. 1 through March 31.
Your Bayswater hotel is the York.</TE>
<TE>   Paris: If Paris is your destination, you can get round-trip air
fare and six nights in a Right Bank hotel for $649 from Go-To
day.com. You'll stay at the Batignolles Villiers. Prices are in
effect from Nov. 1 to March 26, with blackout dates Dec. 15 to Jan.
3.</TE>
<TE>   Spain:  This fall and winter, for $589 per person you can enjoy
five nights in Barcelona, along with round-trip air fare and
breakfast. New tour operator E-Vacations, (877) 471-3876,
www.e-vacations.com, recently created by the Rail Europe
organization, will fly you on Delta from LAX to Barcelona for a stay
at the Hotel Aragon, in the Eixample district near Gaudi's Sagrada
Familia church. That's from Nov. 1 to Dec. 12 and Jan. 3 to Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   If Madrid is more to your liking, Tourcrafters, (800) 621-2259,
www.tourcrafters.com, has a five-night package from LAX for $739. The
dates are Nov. 1 to Dec. 11 and Dec. 25 to March 31; flights are on

<HD>What if serious illness strikes aloft?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathleen Doheny</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most of us who had boarded US Airways Flight 49 in Pittsburgh on a
recent weekday evening were ready to take off for Los Angeles. But
the 6 p.m. departure time had come and gone when the captain picked
up the microphone and told us the flight would be even tardier: A
passenger was disembarking because of a medical problem.</LD>
<LD>   If you're going to get seriously ill on a commercial airliner,
doing so while the plane is still on the tarmac may improve your
chances of getting prompt medical attention. But if your timing is
off, the odds are still good that you'll get the care you need -- if
you know whom to alert and if you check out your airline ahead of
time to determine whether it is one of the growing number that
maintains an air-to-ground link with medical services.</LD>
<LD>   In the past five years, the popularity of such services has boomed
among commercial air carriers. The services allow the flight crew to
consult with on-ground specialists to determine whether basic first
aid aloft is enough or whether the plane needs to be diverted.</LD>
<TE>   Experts say that having the consultation services in place is
better than hoping there's a doctor on board. The doctor may not be
the specialist needed or may not step forward at all because of
litigation fears. (Under the Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998,
air carriers and non-employee passengers who help in an in-flight
medical event are covered by "good Samaritan" protection.)</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the driving force, many major carriers subscribe to the
medical services or maintain their own medical staff to advise flight
crews when passengers have medical problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority of our clients have signed up in the last five
years," says Brant Galloway, a spokesman for MedAire, a Tempe,
Ariz.-based company that counts 39 commercial carriers among its
clients for its MedLink consultation service. Some carriers, he says,
were pioneers in getting the service: "ATA joined up in 1988, and
America West in 1989," Galloway says.</TE>
<TE>   When a passenger falls ill aloft, the first step is to call the
flight attendant, says David Castelveter, a spokesman for US Airways.
"Flight attendants are trained in CPR, medical emergencies and the
use of a defibrillator," which can restore normal heart rhythms, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   If the problem is beyond basic first aid, the flight crew will
contact the medical consultation service, if one is available.</TE>
<TE>   "Our typical call is about a person who is middle-aged or
elderly," says Dr. David W. Claypool, medical director of the Mayo
Clinic's World Travel Response, which provides medical consultation
to Northwest Airlines and other corporate clients. "He has been
traveling all day, hasn't eaten much and almost fainted when he got
up to use the bathroom. Now he's helped back to his seat." Claypool
oversees a staff that includes about seven flight nurses and five
physicians at any one time. In this typical case, hydration and
observation may solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Fainting is the top complaint and the principal reason for
consultations, agrees Galloway of MedAire. (Next most common, he
says, are gastrointestinal problems, cardiac complaints, respiratory
difficulties and neurological problems such as stroke and seizure.)
If a flight crew member calls MedLink about a fainting passenger,
says Galloway, the MedLink doctor will obtain a history, asking the
passenger's age, gender, medical history and so on. The doctor makes
recommendations on caring for the passenger aloft and, if needed,
arranges for paramedics to meet the plane.</TE>
<TE>   A recent call to the medical staff at United Airlines, which
maintains its own in-house service, involved a hemophiliac patient
suffering a nosebleed on a long flight, says Dr. Gary Kohn, the
airline's medical director. He oversees a staff of 13 flight
surgeons, who provide consultation to the United fleet. "In this
case, first aid worked, and there was a paramedic on board to help.
We didn't need to divert."</TE>
<TE>   Diversion for medical problems, in fact, is rare, those in the
industry say. About 1,000 United flights are diverted each year, Kohn
says, about 100 of them for medical reasons.</TE>
<TE>   In a typical year, the Mayo Clinic service fields 350 calls and
diverts about 10% of the related flights, Claypool says. MedLink
received 8,441 calls from commercial carriers in 2001 and diverted
442 flights, Galloway says.</TE>
<TE>   Diversion may not be necessary if a medical volunteer steps
forward, but a medically trained person may not be on the flight or
may not want to help. MedAire has found that volunteers are stepping
forward less often. In 1999, no medical volunteers were on board in
35% of cases where one was called; by 2001 that number had risen to
43%.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision to divert lies with the captain," Claypool says.
"When you make a decision like that, it affects the entire aircraft.
I'll tell him from a medical point of view [what is best]. Then the
captain takes into account weather and other factors.</TE>
<TE>   "One time we had a call about a passenger with chest pains, but
the plane was over Iranian airspace," Claypool says. The captain,
responsible for all the lives on the plane, decided to fly to
Istanbul for medical help. Luckily, the passenger made it. "Our
medical decision [about diversion] is one thing. The final decision
is up to the pilot."</TE>
<TE>   Passengers can reduce the likelihood of needing medical help
aloft, experts say, by checking in with their physician before
long-distance travel, especially if they have chronic cardiac,
respiratory or other conditions or a history of neurological
problems. If a problem does occur during a flight, asking for help
sooner rather than later can improve the odds that first aid, or more
specialized help, will arrive in time to solve it.</TE>

<HD>Coast and canyon on Santa Rosa Island</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>John McKinney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine a lovely, rarely visited island where you can hike into
dramatic canyons, through quiet pine groves and along beaches that
are best described as pristine only because that's more than a
cliche. It's fact.</LD>
<LD>   Several time zones away, you think? No, I'm talking about Santa
Rosa Island, the second largest of the Channel Islands. It's a
25-minute flight from Camarillo Airport, 15 minutes from Santa
Barbara Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Channel Islands Aviation, the concessionaire for Channel Islands
National Park, flies to Santa Rosa Island year-round from Camarillo
and Santa Barbara. Earlier this month I flew with the company twice
-- once from each airport. Getting to the island was part of the fun.</LD>
<TE>   After departing Camarillo, we soared over the mainland and zoomed
past Santa Barbara Channel. We passed over Anacapa Island, then
mountainous Santa Cruz Island, the largest. Santa Rosa came into view
next, with San Miguel on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot circled the channel so we could observe more than a
dozen spouting blue whales. The largest animals on Earth, they looked
gigantic even from the sky.</TE>
<TE>   For our Santa Barbara departure, a thick fog delayed takeoff. When
a patch of blue opened over Santa Rosa, we left. Ten minutes later,
we dropped through a hole in the clouds down to a dirt airstrip.</TE>
<TE>   A national park ranger usually meets visitors. The ranger
accompanies hikers in four-wheel-drive vehicles for easier access to
remote trail heads. Lobos Canyon, for example, is a five-mile
round-trip hike from the trail head but a 15-mile round-trip hike
from the airstrip.</TE>
<TE>   Rangers give a fine introduction to the island's fascinating
ranching history, flora and fauna, and extensive archeological
record. "Arlington Woman," discovered in the isle's Arlington Canyon,
is believed to be the oldest human remains found in North America.</TE>
<TE>   "We recommend that visitors, particularly first-time visitors,
explore the island with a ranger," said ranger Derek Lohuis, who
lived on Santa Rosa for years and now leads hikes.</TE>
<TE>   Old ranch roads form the nucleus of a great trail system, said
Lohuis, who is designing a scenic coastal trail that will circle the
island. When completed, the 50-mile path will lead hikers to
wonderful beaches and coves and a couple of campgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   The best hike now is through Lobos Canyon. Hikers descend the
sandstone-walled Canada Lobos, pausing to admire native island monkey
flower, dudleya and coreopsis. A Chumash village site lies at the
mouth of the canyon, near the ocean. We saw deer browsing brush and
lots of tree frogs in the creek.</TE>
<TE>   Torrey pines grow only on this island and along the San Diego
coast. They're an easy walk from the airstrip. You ascend to a
junction with two dirt roads. The lower road is mostly level and
passes below the grove. The upper road is hillier and follows the
ridgeline above the pines; it offers grand coastal views. The round
trip to the trees is about three miles; if you loop around the pines
on the two dirt roads, you will go about five miles.</TE>
<TE>   The beach at Water Canyon is three miles of white sand on the
fringe of Bechers Bay. It offers the easiest hiking on the island,
and it's just a 10-minute walk from the airstrip. The beach has tide
pools, dramatic sandstone formations and sand dunes.</TE>

<LD>I enjoyed Susan Spano's article, "For some, only superstition
appeases the travel gods" (Her World, Oct. 13). When friends are
going on a long journey or a trip overseas, I give them at least one
dollar to carry with instructions to give it to a beggar on the day
they return home, because I believe angels watch over a traveler on a
mission of charity. My grandmother always gave me a new bill to carry
with me when I went on a trip.</LD>

<LD>JAMES T. Yenckel's "Oases of Luxury in the Desert" (Oct. 6) left out
the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale at Gainey Ranch, for years an all-time
favorite resort. Room rates run $440 and more in high season, but
only in the mid-$100s in summer. There are 10 connecting swimming
pools, one with a sandy beach and a terrific water slide.</LD>
<LD>   The restaurants are outstanding. With the price of an Italian
dinner at the Sandolo comes a free ride for each diner on a gondola
in the enchanting lagoon separating the resort's desert gardens from
its golf course. The gondoliers, music majors at local universities,
sing arias.</LD>
<LD>   There is live entertainment each night, a Native American learning
center with three Hopis on staff, and free bicycles available for the
bike trails.</LD>

<LD>Regarding "Behind the wheel of the RV craze" (On a Budget, Oct. 13):
No doubt RVs are a delightful way to travel, but are they as
economical as Arthur Frommer suggests? I asked some RVers in my area
and none agrees. A typical RV gets 6 to 10 miles per gallon. With
gasoline prices at $1.45 a gallon or more, the cost adds up fast.
Some spend as much as $3,000 a month on the road.</LD>
<LD>   It's easier for me to fly and drive and, I think, just as
economical.</LD>
<LD>   Lutz E. Moeckel</LD>
<TE>   Garden Grove</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Either Frommer did no research before writing the article on RVs
or it was ghostwritten by an intern.</TE>
<TE>   You would be hard pressed to find any worthwhile RV for $50,000. A
well-equipped RV costs $150,000 to $300,000. Many exceed $1 million.
Finding a campground for $10 to $20 a night is like finding a nice
hotel room in Los Angeles for $50. And saying that RVs come with
microwaves, air-conditioning and a propane tank is like saying a car
comes equipped with wheels and a motor.</TE>

food was wonderful, the people were friendly, the monuments were

out-of-control smoking by the Spaniards. On our last night in Madrid,
my wife and I had to flee a well-known expensive restaurant because
the incessant smoking by other patrons overwhelmed us.</LD>

<CP>PHOTO: Night of the living dead sheep? Or eyes made eerie
with digital enhancement? At first we thought Laguna Niguel reader
Joan Herdrich's photo, taken four years ago during a farm stay in Te
Anau, New Zealand, was a trick. But then we saw other snapshots that
proved the ghoulish glow was created by her camera's flash. Herdrich
sheepishly reports that the novelty of feeding this herd and some
deer preceded another treat: a dinner of venison.</CP>

<LD>Costa Alegre, Mexico</LD>
<LD>   SPENDING a week on a tropical beach wasn't only a pleasant
prospect, it was necessary. If we didn't de-stress from our demanding
jobs soon, my significant other and I felt, the alternative would be
a soundproofed white room with bars on the windows.</LD>
<LD>   Bill and I had several requirements. Our dream destination had to
be off the beaten track. No standard, glitzy resort for us. We wanted
to be close to nature, not a five-minute elevator ride away, but
camping wasn't an option. We wanted to be surrounded by natural
splendor from the moment we woke up in a Frette-sheeted bed.</LD>
<TE>   And that's exactly what we got at El Tamarindo, a secluded cluster
of 29 thatch-roofed villas and a fabulous golf course nestled into a
2,040-acre ecological reserve on Mexico's Pacific Coast between
Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo. We found it at Boutique Hotels of
Mexico (www.mexicoboutiquehotels .com), a Web site so tantalizing
that cruising it can begin to feel like a vacation in itself. It
includes colonial mansions and historic monasteries converted to
lodging in large and small Mexican cities, as well as beach resorts.</TE>
<TE>   A friend who had been to El Tamarindo suggested it was gorgeous
but not a place to spend an entire week. "It's great if you're with
someone you love a lot, but there's really very little to do," she
said. In other words, perfect. We chose El Tamarindo for the first
three nights and El Careyes Beach Resort, its sister property less
than an hour's drive away, for the final four. Both are on a stretch
of Mexico's Pacific coastline called the Costa Alegre.</TE>
<TE>   So in March, after an easy 2 1/2-hour flight from L.A. to
Manzanillo, a well-traveled taxi without air-conditioning transported
us to El Tamarindo on the dusty, bumpy 45-minute drive north. The
route took us through small towns that were neither depressing nor
picturesque. (We passed the turnoff to the port town of Barra de
Navidad, which I later learned has lively restaurants, tourist shops
and beaches, but which we never got to.) I imagine that some of the
people who are accustomed to the luxury El Tamarindo offers, perhaps
first-time visitors to Mexico, might be distressed by the
uncomfortable drive.</TE>
<TE>   When we turned off the highway onto El Tamarindo's private
cobblestoned road, it was clear we were leaving the real world. The
sunbaked landscape suddenly gave way to a tropical oasis. Well before
we could see the ocean, we felt cooled by the sheltering forest. The
road wound through dense jungle for 15 minutes or so, finally
arriving at the resort's main building, a large, open structure
supported by the trunks of giant guayabillo trees and covered with an
immense thatched roof, a sort of beach palapa on hormones. It
contained a reception area and a boutique selling bathing suits,
sunscreen and crafts.</TE>
<TE>   The resort was built in 1995 and initially run by a
Singapore-based hotel management firm. But last February, Grupo Plan,
the Mexican real estate company that owns both it and El Careyes,
turned the management over to U.S.-based Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts,
which markets them under its Luxury Collection.</TE>
<TE>   Luxurious simplicity</TE>
<TE>   Once we were registered at El Tamarindo, a bellhop and golf cart
brought us and our luggage to our casita along a meandering pathway
through tropical gardens. The simple white stucco villa, also with a
thatched roof, was only 600 or 700 square feet but felt spacious,
with a bedroom and sitting area, bathroom and dressing room. The main
room's glass doors could slide open to make the patio, bar area,
built-in cushioned banquette and dipping pool seem like one extended
space. The spare decor incorporated natural woods, polished stone
floor inlays and luxurious white bed linens. The effect of the
sophisticated design was a calming simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   As we followed a stone path to the beach, we passed numbers
identifying other casitas hidden among palm trees and lush
landscaping. For $429 a night, excluding meals, we'd chosen a casita
that was away from the beach and less expensive than the larger
villas nearer the water's edge.</TE>
<TE>   Being surrounded by jungle was novel, romantic and extremely
peaceful. The sounds of the jungle, different during the day and
after dark, were a wonderful alternative to the usual noise of
telephone or TV, neither of which was available in our room. (Phones
have since been added.)</TE>
<TE>   Within a few hundred miles there are several deluxe resorts where
the nightly charge can be even more, but I can't believe that they
could be more beautiful. The service was excellent but unobtrusive.
We'd return from a late afternoon walk on the beach to find that
candles had been lighted around our private pool and fresh towels had
been provided. Special insect repellent candles were placed in the
room, but on our next visit I'll bring some bug spray of my own.</TE>
<TE>   The resort's communal area overlooks a stunning beach. All meals
are served outdoors, near the infinity pool. The menu is
international, with a few Mexican selections. Food never would be the
high point of a day for us; it was good enough at the resort's one
restaurant, but choosing from the same menu three times a day for
three days gets monotonous. In March we needed a sweater or wrap in
the evening, and the days were pleasantly warm but not hot.
(Temperatures are similar in the fall and winter.)</TE>
<TE>   El Tamarindo is popular with honeymooners, and most guests kept to
themselves. There were some young American couples and a German
family that had small children and a grandmother in tow. We met a
couple in their 50s from Minneapolis who vacation one week a month so
they don't get in the way of the adult children they'd brought into
the family business. They were sampling all the activities the resort
offers: snorkeling, sea kayaking and golf.</TE>
<TE>   We napped and read, convinced that we'd found the ideal spot in
which to do absolutely nothing. Above the pool, a slatted wooden
platform with an assortment of pillows and views of the ocean was a
favorite spot to sleep, read or daydream. In fact, I napped so much
at El Tamarindo that I was reminded of "Carnal Knowledge," in which
Jack Nicholson says to Ann-Margret, "You sleep more than any woman
over the age of 6 months I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   After nearly three days of blissful laziness, we were ready to
move. Just before sundown on our last evening, we walked the entire
18-hole golf course, designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr. and David
Fleming. Not being golfers, we couldn't judge how challenging or fun
the course was, but it offered magnificent views. Putting greens
overlooked chiseled rock cliffs that dropped dramatically to the
ocean. The Ninth Hole is a restaurant, guess where, that serves
grilled chicken or beef sandwiches and other snacks under a palapa.</TE>
<TE>   The resort was far from booked, and obviously few golfers were in
residence: The course was completely empty! On our five- or six-mile
walk we encountered six lemurs, four wild pigs and many lizards, but
no people under the trees, some as tall as 150 feet, that line the
course. Curious, because the lack of crowds and the spectacular
vistas would make El Tamarindo a golfer's paradise.</TE>
<TE>   A haven on the sand</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps we loved our next stop, El Careyes Beach Resort, so much
because our stay at El Tamarindo had mellowed us so much. A
45-minute, $80 taxi ride along a winding two-lane highway reminded us
how hot and dry Mexico can be, even when the road turns slightly
inland in the tropics (this coastal area lies below the Tropic of
Cancer). Originally called Costa Careyes (Turtle Coast), the area was
developed by Franco Brignone, an Italian entrepreneur who discovered
it in the late 1960s. His goal was not to build a huge resort but to
protect sea turtles and keep the tropical coastline unspoiled. With a
48-room hotel, one- to four-bedroom condominiums and about 20 villas
overlooking a small bay, the area still feels like a well-kept
secret.</TE>
<TE>   But even a 48-room hotel had sounded too big to us. So we reserved
a one-room bungalow on the beach for $325 a night. Compared with the
elegant casita at El Tamarindo, our little bungalow was less than
luxurious, particularly considering the price. It resembled a seaside
haven that Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw might have stopped at while
on the lam in "The Getaway."</TE>
<TE>   One of only three tiny houses at the edge of a quiet beach called
Playa Rosa, it would almost have seemed a little seedy if it hadn't
been such a sexy spot. A double window that opened to the sand became
our back door. We always left it open: At night we'd see silhouettes
of palm trees and moonlight reflected off the water. A seaside
restaurant steps away served whatever fish had been caught that
morning. After the first day, I ambled over there barefoot, tying a
pareo over my bathing suit. Dinners were $40 a person, without
alcohol, and lunches a bit less. The other diners were all casually
dressed -- Americans who'd parked their yachts in the harbor, or
Europeans who rent or own the architecturally interesting
palapa-style villas tucked into the hills overlooking the bay.</TE>
<TE>   For breakfast, we'd climb several flights of stairs, passing the
tile-roofed condominiums terraced along the hillside, to the Lantana,
the hotel's outdoor restaurant. Various shades of bougainvillea grow
like weeds, complementing the Mediterranean village-like architecture
of El Careyes. The stucco buildings have been painted bright pink,
blue, coral, peach, yellow and green. At sundown we walked the hilly
roads overlooking the bay, fantasizing about which villa we'd like to
buy.</TE>
<TE>   On past visits to Mexico, neither one of us had found a spot so
magical. We left wondering how soon we'd be able to return.</TE>

<LD>A 35% discount on VIA Rail in Canada, up to 30% off at Days Inn and a
two-for-the-price-of-one bungee jump in New Zealand (with A.J.
Hackett, the company that introduced the sport) are only a few of the
deals available to students who carry the card when they travel --
the International Student Identity Card, that is.</LD>
<LD>   The 2003 ISIC, which is honored for discounts in more than 90
countries, is available now. It's valid from the day you buy it
through Dec. 31, 2003, for discounts on accommodations, car rentals,
cultural activities, adventure sports, meals and admission to museums
and historic sites.</LD>
<LD>   With an ISIC, you won't have to pay a commission to exchange
currency or traveler's checks at Travelex offices, located in many
large international airports, including ones in London, New York,
Paris, Sydney, San Francisco and Hong Kong. You can also purchase a
buy-back option, which entitles you to return any unspent currency
notes or traveler's checks commission-free at the original purchase
rate.</LD>
<TE>   The ISIC also can be used as a phone card to make international
calls and receive voicemail worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Cardholders also can access an international help line in case of
legal, medical or travel emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   The ISIC was created 50 years ago by the not-for-profit
International Student Travel Confederation (www.istc.org), a
collective of student travel services, because it needed an easy,
common way to identify students throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   The card comes with a booklet listing key discounts and benefits,
with a focus on gateway cities worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   It also provides contact addresses for affiliated foreign student
travel offices, where students can find travel assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Even if a service doesn't list a student rate, it pays to present
the card and ask if there's a discount.</TE>
<TE>   Endorsed by UNESCO</TE>
<TE>   The card, endorsed by the U.N. Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, is issued in more than 100 countries and is
carried by about 5 million students each year. Only full-time
students older than 12 (there is no upper age limit) can obtain the
photo card, which costs $22. Applications are available from STA
Travel, 920 Westwood Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90024; (310) 824-1574,
www.statravel.com.</TE>
<TE>   If you are not a student but are younger than 26, you haven't lost
out on travel deals completely. You are eligible for the
International Youth Travel Card, which comes with discounts
negotiated by the Federation of International Youth Travel
Organizations. This $22 card is also available at STA Travel offices.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hostelworld.com, a worldwide online reservation service for
hostels and other youth travel services, has grown exponentially in
the last six months.</TE>
<TE>   The site was created in 1999 by Tom Kennedy, owner of Dublin's
Avalon Hostel, and Ray Nolan, a software programmer, as a way for
hostels to efficiently handle online bookings.</TE>
<TE>   The online service now books 6,000 beds a day.</TE>
<TE>   Through the site, backpackers can book a bed at more than 2,000
budget properties in 100 countries and arrange more than 300 budget
and adventure activities and tours. But the convenience costs:
There's a 10% deposit and a small booking fee on top of the cost of
lodgings or service.</TE>

<HD>Photo Finish for 'London After Midnight'</HD>
<DH>Using old stills and a continuity script, filmmaker Rick
Schmidlin creates a print of the lost vampire thriller.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the mid-1960s, a vault fire at the old MGM studio in Culver City
destroyed the only known print of the 1927 Lon Chaney thriller
"London After Midnight." The whodunit vampire flick was the most
successful of the 10 collaborations between the Man of a Thousand
Faces and director Tod Browning. And that, it seemed, was that.</LD>
<LD>   But now, nearly 50 years since "London After Midnight" has been
seen in any format, Turner Classic Movies will be broadcasting the
film on Halloween, reconstructed entirely from stills from the MGM
production. Robert Israel created a new score for the presentation.</LD>
<LD>   Filmmaker Rick Schmidlin, who restored Orson Welles' "Touch of
Evil" and Erich Von Stroheim's "Greed," painstakingly reconstructed
"London After Midnight" from more than 200 still photographs from the
collection at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences'
Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study in Beverly Hills and the
complete continuity script housed at the USC library.</LD>
<TE>   "After I did 'Greed,' I was trying to figure out what I could do
next," Schmidlin says. "The most doable project I found was 'London
After Midnight' because I felt I had proved with 'Greed' I could use
still photographs." Schmidlin's 1999 reconstruction of the four-hour
"Greed" used 60% live action footage and 40% stills.</TE>
<TE>   "London After Midnight," which received mixed critical reaction,
was the first American film to feature a vampire.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing to remember is 'London After Midnight' was done for
several different reasons," Schmidlin says. "Browning wanted to
direct 'Dracula' and he wanted Chaney to play 'Dracula.' They wanted
to do it in '27, but they had problems with the Bram Stoker estate to
get the rights to do it. So they made his film partially, I think, as
a vehicle to give the Dracula image to the studio without making it a
blatant retread. Browning kept to his dream. He eventually did direct
'Dracula,' but Chaney had died before that movie, so this was a
glimpse of possibly Chaney's idea of what a vampire image would be."</TE>
<TE>   It can be compared to the performance of the actor who did star in
Browning's "Dracula": Bela Lugosi.</TE>
<TE>   Chaney biographer Michael F. Blake had doubts that Schmidlin could
pull off this experiment until he met with him. "He had access to all
the photographs," says Blake, a former makeup artist. "We sat down
and literally the whole movie is in all of these photos. We got the
original cutting continuity [the shot-by-shot record] and he also had
the original inter-titles continuity for the final print, and by
using them, we could pretty much say this is the way the movie was
when it went out. I think at 45 minutes it moves perfectly."</TE>
<TE>   Though it takes a few minutes to get used to the format, says
Blake, "it certainly gives everybody a complete, clear picture of
what this film was like. A lot of people used to say it was a horror
film. It was never a horror film. The ads I have billed it as a
detective thriller, and that is what it is."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Chaney's other role in the picture as a Scotland Yard
detective is far more integral to the plot.</TE>
<TE>   But with his bulging eyes, wild white hair and tiny sharp teeth,
Chaney's vampire is truly horrifying. Blake says that in a few of the
close-ups of the vampire character, one can actually see the little
wire Chaney used in the corner of his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "The wire would pull down the lower part of the eyelid, and then
he wore a pair of false teeth -- upper and lower -- and he had pale
makeup with shading around the eyes." From a makeup artist's point of
view, Blake says, the design was "so unique that nobody had seen it
before."</TE>
<TE>   Though rumors still abound that some collector is harboring a copy
of "Midnight," Schmidlin and Blake say that's highly unlikely. "You
never know," Blake says, "but the reality is we are looking at a
movie that is 75 years old and the clock is ticking against us.
Watch, the minute this thing airs, three months later somebody is
going to come across a print!"</TE>
<TE>   "London After Midnight" can be seen at 5 p.m. Thursday on Turner
Classic Movies. The network has rated it TV-G (suitable for all
ages).</TE>

<LD>"Rachel, have you decided what you're going to be for Halloween?"
asked her brother Matt.</LD>
<LD>   "You ask me that every year," Rachel said.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, what are you going to be?" Matt asked.</LD>
<TE>   "Guess!" Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hmmmm," said Matt. And he thought for a minute. Then he said, "A
princess."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel shook her head.</TE>
<TE>   "A pumpkin," guessed Matt.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been a pumpkin since I was in kindergarten!" Rachel
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's true," Matt said. "I give up."</TE>
<TE>   "I knew you wouldn't be able to guess!" Rachel said. And she
laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Then she handed Matt a piece of paper. "Solve this crossword
puzzle and you'll know what I'm going to be."</TE>
<TE>   Matt looked at the puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad helped me make it," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   Matt got a pencil and sat down at the table.</TE>
<TE>   "Ready for the first clue?" Rachel asked.</TE>
<TE>   Matt nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "No. 1 across," Rachel said. "My feet go flip-flop, flip-flop when
I ... "</TE>
<TE>   "That's easy!" Matt said. And he printed w-a-l-k in the proper
spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "Right!" Rachel said. "Here's the next clue. No. 5 across.
Something on my face is big and red."</TE>
<TE>   Matt thought for a second. Then he smiled--and printed the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Next clue, please," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "No. 2 down," Rachel said. "My job is to make people ... "</TE>
<TE>   Matt looked at the answers he had already put in the puzzle. No. 2
down started with an "L."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh!" he said. And he printed the answer.</TE>
<TE>   " No. 4 across," Rachel said. "I work in a tent called a ... "</TE>
<TE>   Matt frowned.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember," Rachel said, "there's no space between words in a
crossword puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   Matt counted the spaces. He thought and thought some more. "I
know!" he said. "It's big top!"</TE>
<TE>   "Right!" Rachel said. "Now the last clue. No. 3 down. It's what
I'm going to be for Halloween."</TE>
<TE>   Matt laughed. And printed the answer.</TE>
<TE>   Do you know what Rachel is going to be for Halloween?</TE>

<HD>Another Name at Global Stands Out</HD>
<DH>Former Chief Executive Thomas Casey was at the helm during
the period that is of most interest to investigators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Douglass</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As federal investigators intensify their scrutiny of Global Crossing
Ltd. and its chairman, Gary Winnick, one name keeps popping up:
Thomas J. Casey, a former chief executive and onetime Winnick
intimate who is too ill to speak for himself.</LD>
<LD>   Casey, who is undergoing treatment for colon cancer, ran Global
Crossing out of its Beverly Hills offices for most of 2001, a year
during which executives and employees were scrambling to bolster
faltering sales, preserve cash and stave off a showdown with the
company's banks.</LD>
<LD>   It's also the year that most interests investigators from the
Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, who
are probing whether Global Crossing used misleading accounting to
mask crumbling finances. They want to know, as well, whether Winnick
and other Global Crossing executives were aware of the company's
problems when they sold more than $100 million of stock in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Under questioning about those issues by a congressional panel this
month, the usually hands-on Winnick distanced himself from day-to-day
operations of the company and instead invoked Casey's name more than
50 times -- or about once every eight minutes. None of the other four
chief executives who have run Global Crossing since its founding in
1997 was mentioned even close to the same number of times.</TE>
<TE>   A sampling of Winnick's responses: "Tom Casey, who was the CEO at
this time." And "I think it's important to recognize that Tom was the
CEO of the company during this period of time." And "Tom reported to
me as chairman. He ran the business. He was the CEO." And later: "I
had to rely on Tom Casey."</TE>
<TE>   A person who has worked with both men and listened to the hearing
said he felt as though "Tom Casey was becoming Gary's personal
scapegoat."</TE>
<TE>   But it may not be that simple.</TE>
<TE>   Casey's name also appears in a series of e-mails that discuss the
need to land big network capacity swaps with other telecommunications
companies to meet financial targets. The legitimacy of some of those
deals has been called into question.</TE>
<TE>   Other e-mails where Casey was either mentioned or sent a copy
express varying degrees of concern about Global Crossing's cash
position and its ability to meet performance requirements set by the
company's banks.</TE>
<TE>   And it was Casey who reiterated the company's financial guidance
to Wall Street analysts just weeks before Global Crossing reversed
course. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in January, four
months after Casey left.</TE>
<TE>   As CEO, Casey was ultimately responsible for whatever happened
inside Global Crossing. But former Global Crossing employees who know
Casey and Winnick said it's unlikely that he acted without the
knowledge and consent of his chairman, a friend who once gave him an
Aston Martin convertible.</TE>
<TE>   "If you heard it from Tom, you were hearing it from Gary," said
one former employee.</TE>
<TE>   Even outsiders knew of Winnick's control within Global Crossing.
"It's probably naive to think [Winnick] wasn't deeply involved," said
analyst Patrick Comack of Guzman &amp; Co. "It seemed like he was very
hands-on ... and he was firing these CEOs left and right."</TE>
<TE>   Citing the government's investigations, Global Crossing declined
to discuss -- or make current executives available to discuss -- the
details of Winnick's congressional testimony, the issues behind it or
Casey's tenure at the company.</TE>
<TE>   However, Winnick's longtime attorney Terry Christensen stressed
that his client wasn't trying to blame Casey for anything. In fact,
Christensen said, "Gary's belief is that Tom did everything right....
These fellows are not dumping on each other because they don't think
they did anything wrong."</TE>
<TE>   'A Different Job'</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Christensen said, Winnick wanted to make sure
that lawmakers understood "that as chairman of the company, he had a
different job than the CEO."</TE>
<TE>   "If he had said repeatedly, 'It's not my job' or 'That's not my
job' " without mentioning specifically who held the CEO post, "that
would have sounded terrible," Christensen added. "He was just trying
to make a distinction between what Tom was doing and what he was
doing."</TE>
<TE>   Casey's version of events has not been -- and may never be --
publicly aired.</TE>
<TE>   He has been interviewed by investigators from the SEC and from the
House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations
panel.</TE>
<TE>   Casey had planned to testify with Winnick and other former and
current Global Crossing executives at the committee's Oct. 1 hearing.
But several weeks ago, the 50-year-old was diagnosed with cancer and
underwent surgery, making him too sick to travel to Washington. His
attorney, Patrick Sharkey, declined an interview request.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing, Winnick and Chief Financial Officer Dan Cohrs said
Casey's alarm over looming budget shortfalls, which is evident in
some e-mails, does not point to a motive for any inappropriate
activity, but merely reflects the financial stresses that are common
within a young company like Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   But if investigators reject those explanations, the e-mails could
be viewed as evidence that the company had a reason to fudge its
books, and that Casey and other top executives were aware the company
was in trouble in the first half of 2001, while Winnick and others
were selling shares. (Casey himself didn't unload any of his Global
Crossing stock during this period.)</TE>
<TE>   Casey Forced Out</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing didn't mention its woes publicly until Aug. 1,
when the company revealed worse-than-expected financial results,
lowered year-end revenue targets and announced layoffs and office
closures. Two months later, Casey was forced out and replaced by
current Chief Executive John Legere, who was then running sister
company Asia Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Global Crossing was formed, Winnick met Casey, who was
then a Merrill Lynch investment banker. In 1998, Winnick hired Casey
as Global Crossing's managing director and vice chairman -- and to
double as president and board member of Pacific Capital Group,
Winnick's investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   His role at both companies was to pursue potential deals and other
investment opportunities, and for a time, the two companies shared
the cost of his compensation. Casey and Winnick, who once worked
alongside junk-bond king Michael Milken at Drexel Burnham Lambert,
shared a love of the deal. In his corporate development role, Casey
had a hand in many of Global Crossing's acquisitions, including Racal
Telecom, Cable &amp; Wireless' Global Marine unit and Frontier Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick trusted Casey. The two executives were friendly enough to
dine together with their wives, and at one point, they even took a
Mediterranean vacation together as a foursome, according to former
employees who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Casey, a silver-haired man with bright blue eyes, was often
smiling. Despite being born in Frankfurt, Germany, and raised in
Boston and Washington, D.C., he liked to play up his Irish heritage,
the former employees said.</TE>
<TE>   He was well-liked within the company because he treated other
workers with courtesy and respect, these people said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, people who know Casey say he lacked experience in running a
company and was not an obvious choice for the chief executive's job
in late 2000, when Winnick named him to replace departing CEO Leo
Hindery.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer and Deal-Maker</TE>
<TE>   Casey spent most of his career as a lawyer and deal-maker. After
earning a law degree from George Washington University, he served as
a trial attorney and utilities specialist in the antitrust division
of the Justice Department, then moved to the Federal Communications
Commission, where he rose to become deputy chief of operations in the
common carrier bureau, the division that regulates telecommunications
firms.</TE>
<TE>   When he left government work in 1981, he joined a team of
Washington lawyers representing telecommunications and media
companies with issues before the FCC. Four years later, Casey moved
on to mergers and acquisitions, spending three years at Merrill
Lynch, where he became co-head of the firm's global communications
group and helped direct Merrill's worldwide investment banking
activity in telecommunications.</TE>
<TE>   His Merrill affiliation led him to Winnick and Global Crossing.
And, like many of Global Crossing's executives, Casey was well-paid
for making the switch.</TE>
<TE>   When he became CEO, Global Crossing awarded him a $1.1-million
salary and gave him an $8-million loan that was later forgiven. In
2000, he received a $1-million bonus, plus stock options for 3
million Global Crossing shares. At the end of 2000, Casey's
unexercised shares that were "in the money" were valued at $16.5
million, though none of those shares were cashed in before the stock
tanked, according to Thomson Financial.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have long faulted Global Crossing for awarding highly
lucrative compensation packages to its executives. But other payments
to Casey also may raise questions among the company's creditors.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the company and its subsidiaries paid Casey nearly
$400,000 in expense reimbursements, including several payments that
were atypical because they were for even amounts -- including one for
$60,000 on the nose and six for exactly $20,000 each, according to
company filings in Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't tell whether it's suspicious, curious or mundane" just
from the filings, said bankruptcy attorney William J. Rochelle. "But
round numbers like that raise anybody's eyebrows."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing also forgave $336,828 in interest on the
$8-million loan and paid Casey $328,183 to cover taxes on the loan,
which essentially was additional compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Not counting stock options, Casey's 2001 compensation totaled more
than $13 million in cash and loans that didn't have to be repaid.
Some $3.5 million of that represented his severance.</TE>
<TE>   Casey's tenure at Global Crossing ended abruptly, and not
voluntarily, at the end of the third quarter of 2001, when he was
replaced by Legere.</TE>
<TE>   Christensen, Winnick's lawyer, said the two men "still feel very
warmly toward each other." But insiders say the parting was not so
friendly. "When Gary treated Tom badly, I think people were unhappy,"
said one former manager. "If anyone gave [Winnick] his soul, it was
Tom."</TE>

<HD>Investors Warming to a Lula Win in Brazil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brazil today almost certainly will elect a president from the
Workers' Party who opposes free-trade agreements with the United
States and many other policies Washington favors for improving poor
economies.</LD>
<LD>   The very prospect of the election of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva --
a labor union leader known universally as Lula -- has had
international financiers fearing a default on Brazil's debts and a
collapse of its currency. Many banks in recent months have pulled
capital out of the country, and businesses there are starved for
funds. Interest rates have skyrocketed to 27%. And many worry that a
continued erosion of Brazil's economy would bring further disaster to
South America and rippling damage to the U.S. and the rest of the
world.</LD>
<LD>   "It's looking like a crisis," says Ross Kaufman, an international
attorney in New York who has worked with Brazilian companies for 15
years.</LD>
<TE>   But others are starting to look past such doomsday scenarios --
and for good reason.</TE>
<TE>   Geoffrey Dennis, manager of Latin American investment funds for
Salomon Smith Barney, is among those now recommending that investors
"overweight Brazil" because many companies listed on its Bovespa
stock exchange (some two dozen of which also are listed on the Big
Board in New York) have declined sharply in the last two years and
could rise "with improvement in the Brazilian economy."</TE>
<TE>   Josephine Jimenez, manager of Montgomery Securities' $600-million
emerging markets fund, feels similarly. Her San Francisco firm has
just increased the Brazilian portion of the fund by about 30% to more
than $50 million. Specifically, Montgomery hopes to invest in
companies serving the Brazilian domestic market, including
supermarkets and banks.</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez traveled to Sao Paulo a few months ago and, having met
with Lula's economic advisors, is convinced that his administration
wouldn't be made up of the socialist caricatures that many have
painted. "I'm confident that they will be friendly to business," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis and Jimenez are on to something. Regardless of his past
rhetoric, Lula has no choice but to work with the interna- tional
financial community to reform the country's massively distorted
economy.</TE>
<TE>   In Step With IMF</TE>
<TE>   To forestall immediate crisis, the International Monetary Fund,
with backing from the U.S. Treasury, is extending $30 billion in
financing to Brazil. And Lula already has pledged to pursue
noninflationary economic policies that comply with IMF directives.</TE>
<TE>   "The Brazilian economy is fundamentally stronger" than many think,
says Lourenco Goncalves, president of California Steel Industries, a
Fontana mill that is 50%-owned by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, a Rio
de Janeiro-based iron ore company. (The other 50% is owned by Japan's
Kawasaki Steel.)</TE>
<TE>   During other eras, perhaps, a labor leader like Lula -- a man who
rose from poverty by working in the metal trades -- might have made
the usual socialist promises of pay raises for the lower class,
higher taxes on the rich and a heavy government hand in industry. But
the basic structure of Brazil's economy simply won't allow for such
old-fashioned policies anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Its problem is that two decades of military rule from the 1960s to
the mid-1980s, followed by heavy state control of industry, left the
country with strange economic ills. For example, civil servants in
the federal government, plus 27 state governments, enjoy retirement
before age 50 with pension benefits that equal 100% of their earnings
and other entitlements.</TE>
<TE>   Taxes are high but not always collected. Experts on Brazil, such
as Professor Raul Gouvea, who teaches management at the University of
New Mexico, estimate that the country's "informal" economy of
businesses operating outside the tax system is as large as the
official $640-billion annual gross domestic product of goods and
services.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's formal economy is extremely small for so large a country.
At more than 3 million square miles, Brazil's size is equal to that
of the United States, while its population of 170 million is about
three-fifths as large.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Brazil's economy is only one-twentieth that of the U.S. Put
another way, Brazil's economic output is only slightly larger than
that of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Tapping Huge Potential</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Lula knows full well that the huge potential of
Brazil's market has yet to be fulfilled. And for the economy to reach
that potential, Brazil needs more than $25 billion a year in foreign
business investment. Without that, most people there will continue to
earn $1.50 or less a day, and unemployment will continue to rise in
the face of 1.5 million additional workers who join the labor force
every year.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Brazil attracted $31 billion in foreign investment,
with Spanish companies putting in the most money, followed by U.S.
companies. But this year, foreign investment is expected to total
only $16 billion.</TE>
<TE>   To get that total back up, Lula's Brazil must compete with other
countries seeking investment funds from Europe, Japan and the U.S. --
including Mexico, which has taken in far more foreign investment than
Brazil in recent years because it signed free-trade agreements with
the U.S. and the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Brazil is looking enviously at Mexico today, feeling in
many ways that it should be the one attracting the most foreign
capital that leads to jobs and development. After all, "we are the
largest country in Latin America," says Jose Vicente Pimentel,
Brazilian consul general in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Lula will certainly continue to oppose the all-out opening of
Brazil's economy. "He is distrustful of what the U.S. is offering,"
says Gouvea, the University of New Mexico professor.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, the chances are that Lula and his Brazil will be
forced to make some compromise with Washington and the global
economy. There is no other way if they are to lift living standards
and make the country's long-declared leadership of South America a
reality.</TE>
<TE>   Lula may bark some. But as Goncalves, the steel executive, notes:
"Lula won't bite."</TE>

<LD>Regarding "U.S. Must Loosen Two Sides' Tight Grip on Ports," Oct. 16:</LD>
<LD>   Why does the solution seem to be to tie the hands of American
labor instead of considering that the Pacific Maritime Assn. may be
too strong and should not be able to wield the power it has been
using?</LD>
<LD>   My husband has been a member of the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union for 44 years and has seen many changes. My son has
been a casual worker for the last five years; casuals have no union
status. I hear from both what is really happening on the docks.</LD>
<TE>   I have come to realize that the PMA is very good at public
relations and has been able to slant the news its way. ILWU
representatives come from the rank and file and are not as polished
but are hard-working individuals.</TE>
<TE>   What is the answer? Perhaps the individual companies should
negotiate the work for themselves, not through the PMA.</TE>
<TE>   What would this accomplish? If there were an impasse, only that
one company would be affected, while other companies could continue
business as usual. I think this solution would level the field.</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Cole-Heston</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The fact is it was the PMA that intentionally drained the U.S.
economy of billions of dollars merely to try to avoid paying a decent
wage to an additional 100 workers the ILWU wanted to cover by their
bargaining unit in exchange for accepting new job-killing technology
in the ports.</TE>
<TE>   The greed of the port owners is astonishing; the damage they have
done to the U.S. as a whole is immense.</TE>
<TE>   Randall Smith</TE>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although very serious, one 10-day disruption in 31 years is not
cause to take the extreme legislative action proposed by James
Flanigan.</TE>
<TE>   These certainly are contentious negotiations. But the issues will
be resolved with the simple help that the law currently offers: a
federal mediator. With all due respect to Mr. Flanigan, his
suggesting federalizing labor-management relations while using the
inflammatory terms "future crippling disputes" and "future disasters"
is excessive.</TE>
<TE>   The ILWU's Sept. 29 offer to extend the expired contract made the
PMA's use of a lockout completely unwarranted. Accepting that offer
would have made any alleged slowdown an illegal act, and the cargo
would have continued to flow.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Imbagliazzo</TE>
<TE>   ILWU Local 13</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Palos Verdes</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is important to note that because of the lock the ILWU has on
the ports, prior contracts have resulted in the union getting its way
with some ridiculous wage packages, work rules and other concessions
by the ship companies.</TE>
<TE>   Where else in this country does an organization exist where the
only people who can get in are relatives or have close ties with
members who sponsor their entry? You or I could not walk into the
ILWU hall and get a job. It is a private club.</TE>
<TE>   Where else can someone with a high school education or less work
four hours, get paid for eight hours and at the end of the year have
made more than $110,000 plus overtime, plus a benefit package in
excess of $30,000 contributed 100% by the employers?</TE>
<TE>   Chris Knopp</TE>
<TE>   International Freight Transport</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We must not let the federal government dictate what happens in the
ports.</TE>
<TE>   All the laws on the books today are designed to break strikes and
get union labor back with the program and not hurting the American
public.</TE>
<TE>   The issue today, however, has nothing to do with union labor
hurting anyone. This crisis was the result of the PMA conducting a
well-planned and thought-out lockout of labor. The union has never
once talked about conducting a strike.</TE>
<TE>   You are advocating punishing the union (American citizens) for
something the PMA (mostly foreign shipping lines, most of which are
fully owned and operated by foreign governments) perpetrated on the
American public.</TE>

<HD>Borrowing More Money Just Digs the Hole Deeper</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Liz Pulliam Weston</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I was recently offered a seven-year, $15,000 personal loan
at 9.9% interest from an out-of-state bank. Although the interest on
most of my credit cards is 9.9%, the minimum payments on my $15,000
balances are so high that I have little left to live on until the
next payday.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, I was turned down for the loan because I have too
many credit cards with high balances. I believe I have good credit.
How can I obtain one of these loans at a decent rate?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: This may come as a terrible shock, but the way to get out
of credit trouble is not to borrow more money.</LD>
<TE>   And you, sir, are in credit trouble. Even paying the minimums on
your credit cards is a strain, and you recently were turned down for
a loan because you had too much debt.</TE>
<TE>   Had you been approved for this loan, by the way, you probably
wouldn't have received the touted 9.9% rate. If you read the fine
print, you'll see that most of these "personal loan" offers have
variable rates based on your credit. Yours apparently isn't as good
as you thought because a lender looked at you and saw a considerable
risk.</TE>
<TE>   The answer to your problem is to stop looking for ways to make
smaller payments on your debt. Instead, buckle down and make larger
payments each month on your credit cards to get your debt paid off
sooner. You may need to sell some assets, stop eating out or find a
second job to speed things along.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yes, and by the way: Stop using credit cards to buy stuff. You
should be on a cash-only basis until the last payment is made. That's
essential to the whole "you can't get out of a hole while you're
still digging" game plan.</TE>
<TE>   Liability Insurance Is a Sensible Investment</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've written about the importance of having adequate
liability insurance. But if I have a net worth of $1 million and I
get an umbrella liability policy that covers me for up to $1 million,
what's to stop someone from suing me for both my net worth and my
insurance policy?</TE>
<TE>   A: Technically, nothing. Fortunately, in the real world -- and
with real lawyers -- that's generally not how it works.</TE>
<TE>   Given a choice between attaching your assets and settling for an
attractive sum from your insurance company, most attorneys will
settle for the insurance. If your liability coverage is grossly
inadequate, however, and you've got anything worth going after, the
opposition's lawyers will overcome their inertia and try to attach
what they can.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, liability insurance is relatively cheap. Boosting
your liability coverage on your homeowners and auto policies to the
maximum, then adding a $1-million umbrella policy, generally will
cost you a few hundred dollars a year. For someone with a net worth
of $500,000 or more, it's a sensible investment.</TE>
<TE>   'Happily Ever After'  Isn't Priceless</TE>
<TE>   My column " 'Til Debt Do Us Part' Is Extravagant Couple's Vow'
(Sept. 1) prompted comments from readers. One of the letters:</TE>
<TE>   Thank you so much for setting straight the couple who said they
could afford a $35,000 wedding but who in reality were maxing out
their credit cards to pay for it. I'm a member of Debtors Anonymous,
a 12-step group based on the principles of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Spending and debting is such a disease in our country. We need more
people like you willing to speak up and educate others.</TE>
<TE>   We need, at the very least, a little common sense when it comes to
using credit. Charging a wedding to a credit card makes no sense,
even though this couple planned to pay off the debt with cash gifts
from their guests.</TE>
<TE>   Another reader's comments:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen years ago, I was remiss in not convincing my fiancee that
we couldn't afford anything more than a small wedding. At the time we
had a combined income of less than $30,000, but opted for a wedding
costing us close to $10,000. The logic was simple: We'll pay it off
with all the wonderful cash gifts we'd receive. That, however, was an
assumption, not a reality. We received $1,350 in cash gifts from
about 15 of the 150 guests. The debt we incurred became one of the
primary reasons our marriage lasted just barely longer than the
open-bar reception.</TE>
<TE>   As you learned, the stress of starting your married life in debt
can be fatal to the union. Loving couples should consider giving
themselves the gift of paid-off credit cards and an affordable event,
rather than taking on bills they can't pay.</TE>

<HD>EBay Entrepreneurs Bidding on Success</HD>
<DH>Sierra Madre couple's home-based auction operation affords
them a new way of life but little time for themselves</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can find everything on EBay from a Learjet to a velvet painting
of Elvis. But Jay and Marie Senese have found something far more rare
on the auction site: a new way of life.</LD>
<LD>   EBay  Inc. has afforded the husband-and-wife entrepreneur team the
chance to earn a living selling CDs from their Sierra Madre home.
They wrote a business plan, found sources for the more than 5,000
used CDs they put up for bid weekly, worked out the considerable
logistics for handling their auctions and hired two full-time
employees and several part-timers. The Seneses report to no one.</LD>
<LD>   If only they could take a day off.</LD>
<TE>   The couple's operation, known as 1 Cent CD, is by far the most
successful home-based business operating on EBay, as measured by
volume of merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   But like thousands of other full-time EBay merchants, the Seneses
have discovered one of the great ironies of the Internet: The 21st
century technology that has enabled them to run a business from home
also has trapped them in an 18th century, work-consuming lifestyle
reminiscent of farmers tied to their land or shopkeepers who lived
above the store.</TE>
<TE>   This autumn afternoon in the Senese living room is typical. Marie
Senese, 42, sits at a retro-style Formica table set up in front of
the television. Stacked on the table and spilling onto the floor are
37 plastic trays, each holding 20 CDs. She picks up and types in the
information that will be listed on EBay when the disc is put up for
auction.</TE>
<TE>   Then she picks up another and another.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like having your own shop, except at the end of the day you
don't get to go home," she said. "You're already there. And so is the
work."</TE>
<TE>   Every day -- including weekends -- the Seneses put 800 used CDs up
for bid. Nearly all will be sold five days later, when the auctions
end.</TE>
<TE>   They begin the workday just after dawn and often don't finish
until midnight. Weekends, when they are without their paid staff, are
worse. Since founding 1 Cent CD three years ago, they have taken
exactly four vacation days, and even then they took their laptop
along.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets weary," said Marie Senese.</TE>
<TE>   'Global From Day One'</TE>
<TE>   With the advent of EBay, launching a business seems seductively
easy. There are no bricks-and-mortar storefronts to rent, no
distribution channels to create, no marketing campaigns to launch,
not even an Internet domain name to register.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the expertise you need to have a professional-looking
business is already built into the system," said Jerome Katz, a
professor at St. Louis University who has written several academic
journal articles about EBay. "One of the marks of business maturity
is that you get to the point where you sell to global markets. On
EBay, you're global from day one."</TE>
<TE>   Executives of San Jose-based EBay said they have no detailed
information on how many of the sellers among their 50 million
registered users consider it their full-time work. But they estimate
about 90,000 of them make at least $2,000 in monthly sales.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost since the beginning, 20% of our sellers have accounted for
80% of sales volume," said EBay Chief Executive Meg Whitman. "These
people, including those who sell full time, are central to our
success."</TE>
<TE>   For 1 Cent CD, the workday begins at 6:30 a.m. Jay Senese, 44,
fires up the desktop computer in the couple's bedroom and peruses the
approximately 800 e-mails that arrive each day. Marie Senese gets
their 9-year-old son off to school.</TE>
<TE>   On weekdays, Jay Senese climbs into his 1994 Saturn wagon and
makes his rounds to the used CD shops in Southern California that
supply 1 Cent CD with products.</TE>
<TE>   Record shops always have played an important role in Jay Senese's
life. He met Marie in Lovell's Records in Whittier 20 years ago.
Dressed in jeans, a paisley shirt, and with his long, graying hair
pulled back in a ponytail beneath an ever-present baseball cap, he
still looks the part of a rock fan. A business degree at Whittier
College and a job at Merrill Lynch hardly damped his enthusiasm for
head-banging music.</TE>
<TE>   With a stockbroker's salary of $250,000 a year, Jay Senese spent
lavishly on his music habit. He sometimes bought 500 CDs at a time,
eventually amassing a library of 30,000. To make room for them all,
he discarded the plastic jewel boxes and pressed them disc-to-disc on
wooden racks in the living room and bedroom. He not only bought CDs,
he sold them to other rock fans who frequented Internet message
groups.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was a hobby, but Merrill Lynch saw the online CD sales
as an entrepreneurial venture, and in July 1998 the firm terminated
him in part because he was running an undisclosed business. Merrill
Lynch also cited his "personal trading in penny stocks and financial
adjustments to his own account" in a report it made to the National
Assn. of Securities Dealers, the brokerage industry's self-policing
organization. Senese, who said the reason for the firing was a money
dispute, filed a suit against the firm in 1999 that is still
unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   A Business Is Born</TE>
<TE>   After he lost his job, he began shedding his CD collection in
earnest to pay the mortgage and put food on the table, selling 10,000
in six months. But some titles found no takers.</TE>
<TE>   That setback became a business inspiration. In late 1998, Senese
turned to EBay, offering some hard-to-unload discs at a minimum bid
of a penny apiece. But the penny price didn't last long as EBay users
around the world engaged in bidding wars over the music. The
experiment worked so well that the Seneses began formulating a
business plan for a full-time endeavor.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Senese began calling on the CD shops he knew so well. They
often bought used CDs for about $1 and tried to sell them for $6 or
$7. But there were always some that remained in the bins for weeks or
even months.</TE>
<TE>   "They would end up marking them down every week," he said. "I said
to them, 'Give me first crack at it and I'll give you $2 or $3 for a
CD, right now.' "</TE>
<TE>   For independent CD shops, which operate on tight profit margins,
the quick return that Senese offered was irresistible -- especially
given the large number of discs he was looking to purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Senese won't even go to a shop unless he can buy at least 1,000
CDs on a single visit. He pays an average of $3 to $4 per CD and
often contacts the shops at the end of the month -- right before the
rent is due -- to get a more favorable price. "I used to be a very
good customer at a lot of these stores," he said. "Now I am their
best customer."</TE>
<TE>   Compared with Internet message groups, EBay offers the Seneses
access to a much bigger and more diverse group of potential buyers.
In turn, the Seneses' location just miles from Hollywood gives them
access to a wider range of music than many of the fans trolling
EBay's auction listings.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized that we could get a used Posies CD here, but a guy
out there in Iowa can't just walk down the street and find it," Marie
Senese said.</TE>
<TE>   The Seneses won't say how much their operation makes each year.
But on a recent Saturday, 1 Cent CD completed 716 auctions that
brought in $3,556.72, according to results available on the EBay
site. Among the CDs that sold that day were offerings from No Doubt,
Jimi Hendrix, The Chieftains, Luciano Pavorotti, k.d. lang, Roy
Orbison, Peter Gabriel and Roy Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   A Penny for That CD</TE>
<TE>   The bidding on every CD that the Seneses offer starts at a penny.
The average winning bid for a CD on the recent Saturday was $4.97,
with the highest of $41 for an out-of-print edition of the 1976 Peter
Frampton release "Frampton Comes Alive." Among the discs that sold
for only a penny were the soundtrack from "National Lampoon's Senior
Trip" and a Hallmark CD collection called "Peace Train."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest expense for 1 Cent CD is fees to EBay, which top
$100,000 a year. The Seneses pay 30 cents to list an item whether or
not it sells. If it does, they also pay a 5.25% commission.</TE>
<TE>   They pay their workers near minimum wage and spend $1,500 a month
on rent for two small storage spaces and an unassuming office in
Sierra Madre, where three workers sit at computers to process
payments and track items through the system.</TE>
<TE>   Postage, which is paid by the buyer, will amount to about $300,000
this year. That makes 1 Cent CD the biggest customer at the Sierra
Madre Post Office, according to postal workers there.</TE>
<TE>   In the office, which doubles as the shipping center, clerks pull
CDs from the racks, stuff them into padded envelopes and apply
stamps. Shawn Kniep, 19, points out to Jay Senese that one of the
discs in a multi-CD order is missing. The winning bid for the item
was $1.25.</TE>
<TE>   Without hesitation, Senese pulls three dollar bills from his
pocket and drops them into the package for the customer. No note is
included.</TE>
<TE>   "That would take too much time," he said. "I figure he will
understand."</TE>
<TE>   With fees, rent, salaries and other expenses, Jay Senese figures a
CD needs to fetch $5 to $6 at auction to make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   The highest price they ever got -- $293.88 -- was for a rare
recording of the Charles Gounod opera "Le Medecin Malgre Lui." At the
other end of the scale, about 5% of the 1 Cent CD listings are not
bid on at all or go for a mere penny.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working for margins of pennies," said Jay Senese. "If
something costs 3 cents extra, it kills us."</TE>
<TE>   At the house, Marie Senese continues inputting CD information on
her laptop. Her goal is to finish 60 CDs before the day is out. She
also will truck CDs to and from the storage spaces, deal with the
typists and do paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes work and family time are combined.</TE>
<TE>   "They asked my son in the first grade what he does at home and he
said, 'I help my mom sort CDs and put them in trays,' " she said.
"It's one of his earlier memories."</TE>
<TE>   Jay Senese often spends part of the afternoons working at the
laptop in the living room while his son watches his favorite cartoon
show, "SpongeBob SquarePants." It's not undivided quality time, but
he says it's better than when he worked as a broker and logged
18-hour days.</TE>
<TE>   Dreaming of Vacation</TE>
<TE>   The Seneses speak longingly of taking a real vacation. But that
would mean getting thousands of CD titles typed up ahead of time so
an employee could start the auctions later. They haven't managed to
do that. "On paper, we should be able to get ahead," said Jay Senese.
"But something always comes up."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Senese, who personally launches every auction, has a dire
fear of breaking his string of new postings. "I'm superstitious," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   There are only two days a year the Seneses don't put new CDs up
for auction: Dec. 19 and Dec. 20. If they did, those auctions would
close on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, when bidders would be
scarce and the chances of getting a good price would be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Senese said 1 Cent CD generates a six-figure income for his

<HD>Iraq Regime Change Could Weaken OPEC</HD>
<DH>Restoring the country's oil production capacity might be
enough to break the cartel's grip on world markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Warren Vieth</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>You would think that a war in the Middle East would send oil prices
skyrocketing.</LD>
<LD>   And initially, it most certainly would. But in what could prove to
be a surprising twist, a regime change in Iraq could have the
opposite effect on the world's oil markets over the long haul.</LD>
<LD>   As the storm clouds gather over Iraq, the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries faces what could be the biggest test
since its birth in Baghdad 42 years ago: a decade or more of swelling
production and sliding prices.</LD>
<TE>   It might not be the primary objective of a U.S. offensive, but one
important consequence of toppling Saddam Hussein would be a
substantially weakened OPEC. Even if military action produced an
initial spike in oil prices, government officials, industry analysts
and energy experts believe that Iraq would need to maximize oil
production to finance reconstruction. OPEC's 10 other members would
have little choice but to go along, experts say, and their own
cash-flow needs would limit their ability to prop up prices by
reducing output.</TE>
<TE>   The likely result would be several years of oil prices in the
neighborhood of $20 a barrel or less, compared with nearly $30
recently, forecasters say. Some believe prices could fall even
further as Iraq's production capacity expanded.</TE>
<TE>   "OPEC faced many challenges in the past, but was able to control
itself and restore some kind of price stability," said Fadhil
Chalabi, a former OPEC and Iraq oil ministry official who heads the
Centre for Global Energy Studies in London. "Iraq will be the biggest
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   OPEC's fundamental problem is that it is bucking the forces of
supply and demand.</TE>
<TE>   Not counting Iraq, its members have the capacity to pump as much
as 29 million barrels of oil a day, but they have adopted quotas
totaling 21.7 million barrels in an effort to keep prices high. Most
of them are flagrantly exceeding their self-imposed limits, however,
and they might be unwilling to slam on the brakes as Iraq's
production rises from less than 2 million barrels a day now to as
much as 6 million barrels in several years.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry analysts say the restoration of Iraq's production
capability over the next decade might be enough to break OPEC's grip
on world oil markets, even if Iraq remained a nominal member.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to see Iraq under any circumstances really
participating closely with OPEC in the next five years," said analyst
Raad Alkadiri of Petroleum Finance Co. in Washington. "If you have a
government in Iraq that is closely tied to the United States and
dependent on the United States for its continued power, it is
conceivable that it will feel pressure to leave OPEC."</TE>
<TE>   Opening the Spigot</TE>
<TE>   OPEC's loss would be others' gain.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Undersecretary of State Grant Aldonas cited the potential
economic payoff during a recent trip to Poland. A regime change, he
said in Warsaw, would "open up the spigot on Iraqi oil, which would
have a profound effect in terms of the performance of the world
economy."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at OPEC headquarters in Vienna did not respond to
requests for interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, even pessimists acknowledge that other outcomes are
possible. Oil prices could surge and stay high for years if Hussein
managed to torch his oil fields in the dying days of his regime.
Iraq's ability to maintain even its current production could be
disrupted if the country splintered into hostile factions after a
war. Political instability in other oil-producing Arab states could
roil markets and raise prices.</TE>
<TE>   But most analysts consider those longshots. A more likely scenario
is an era of rising production in which about the best OPEC could
hope for would be to keep the price of oil from falling too far below
its target of $22 to $28 a barrel.</TE>
<TE>   If events broke the wrong way and OPEC botched its response,
prices in the single digits would not be out of the question, experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   It would not be the first brush with disaster for OPEC, which was
founded at Iraq's prompting in 1960 after the big multinational oil
companies lowered the posted price of crude without bothering to
consult the countries whose economies depended on petroleum exports.
The founding members were Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela. They were joined later by Qatar, Indonesia, Libya, the
United Arab Emirates, Algeria and Nigeria.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC achieved notoriety a decade later, when prices soared in
response to the Yom Kippur war and the Arab oil embargo of 1973, the
Iranian revolution in 1978 and the Iran-Iraq war that began in 1980.
Taking off from about $3 a barrel in the early 1970s, prices reached
a high of about $35 in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Then came OPEC's first big crisis. The price increases of the
1970s caused a drilling boom, leading to increased production, and
created incentives to conserve, causing consumption to decline.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, Saudi Arabia decided it no longer would bear nearly the
entire burden of restricting production to shore up prices. When it
opened the spigot, oil tumbled to $11 a barrel. Other OPEC members
agreed to abide by production quotas, and the price gradually
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Another collapse occurred during the Asian financial crisis in
1998. OPEC misjudged the market and increased production. The price
fell to less than $10 a barrel, and it took substantial quota cuts,
along with a global recovery, to restore balance.</TE>
<TE>   Energy experts say rising Iraqi production after a regime change,
when combined with other problems, would present OPEC with its third
big test.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Gold, vice president of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation in New York, said he believed Iraq would remain a member
of OPEC. "But they won't accept any significant limits on their
production for some time," he said. "The others will have to
accommodate, and not without some pain."</TE>
<TE>   Gold said he believed OPEC would be able to adjust. "When the wolf
was at the door, they've always managed to come together somehow," he
said. "They seem to do best when things get really desperate."</TE>
<TE>   Much would depend on the composition of a new Iraqi government and
the degree of influence exercised by the United States, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The signals have been mixed. A prominent Iraqi opposition leader
declared this month that a new government would expand oil production
and exceed Iraq's OPEC quota to generate revenue to pay off debts and
finance reconstruction. But he also said a post-Hussein regime would
work with OPEC and try not to undermine the organization. Whether it
would remain a member was unclear.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC on Agenda</TE>
<TE>   A more definitive forecast may be forthcoming. The State
Department is preparing to host a two-day meeting of opposition
leaders to discuss, among other things, the restoration of Iraq's oil
production capability and its future role in OPEC. U.S. officials
have said they do not intend to dictate the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Morse, senior advisor at Hess Trading Co. in New York and a
former State Department official, said he believes Iraq would choose
to remain a member of OPEC, and the United States would not attempt
to prevent it from doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad will need the help and deep pockets of its OPEC neighbors
to rebuild its production and export infrastructure, he said. After
Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia shut down a pipeline
capable of moving 1.6 million barrels a day of Iraqi oil to export
markets.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it unimaginable that the U.S. government is going to tell
any Iraqi government what it ought to be doing in or outside OPEC,"
Morse said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many analysts, including Morse, expect the price of oil to
slide to the low $20s even if OPEC hangs tough and Iraq stays on
board.</TE>
<TE>   "OPEC faces problems not just from Iraq," said Petroleum Finance
Co.'s Alkadiri. "Global demand isn't increasing that rapidly. You
have a lot of non-OPEC production coming on. Within OPEC, you have
countries that are well over their production quotas. You have a
whole bunch of problems that point to a struggle within the
organization and, ultimately, to the unsustainability of present
prices."</TE>

<HD>Support Urged for Mutual Fund Rule</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mutual fund investors are being urged to get involved in a seemingly
arcane regulatory battle to safeguard their investments from hidden
conflicts of interest.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is a proposed Securities and Exchange Commission rule
that would require mutual fund companies to disclose how they voted
on proposals presented to shareholders of companies in which the
funds hold stock. These proposals range from mundane -- such as the
reelection of auditors -- to meaningful, such as issues involving
executive compensation and shareholder rights.</LD>
<LD>   "Mutual fund companies are going to do whatever they can behind
the scenes to kill this proposal or water it down," said Tim Grant,
president of Pax World Funds in Washington and one of several
activists trying to drum up support for the SEC proposal. "This is
not going to happen unless individual investors get involved."</LD>
<TE>   It's an important debate because fund companies control 21% of the
equity holdings in the U.S. on behalf of 90 million individual
shareholders -- who buy the funds on their own or through 401(k) and
other company-sponsored retirement plans.</TE>
<TE>   Too often, fund companies vote with management in an apparent
effort to safeguard lucrative 401(k) administration contracts with
those same companies, said Mercer Bullard, president of a
Mississippi-based investor rights group called Fund Democracy.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Fidelity Investments  administers the 401(k) plan at
Lockheed Martin Corp., a Bethesda, Md.-based defense contractor. The
AFL-CIO, one of the groups backing the SEC's disclosure rule, alleges
that Fidelity voted with Lockheed management in April to reelect a
former Enron Corp. director to Lockheed's board.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the AFL-CIO suspects that Fidelity voted in favor of
management proposals at Tyco International Ltd., Nabors Industries
Ltd. and Ingersoll-Rand Co. to reincorporate in Bermuda -- moves that
diminished shareholder rights at all three companies, said Michael I.
Garland, corporate transactions coordinator for the AFL-CIO Office of
Investment.</TE>
<TE>   The labor organization also says Fidelity voted against a recent
proposal at Halliburton Co., which is under SEC investigation over
allegedly improper recording of revenue, that would have stopped the
company from contracting out lucrative consulting work to its
auditing firm.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations can't be proved because Fidelity selectively
discloses how it votes on shareholder issues -- disclosing votes that
it believes will be popular and keeping secret other votes, Bullard
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Such selective disclosure constitutes fraud in other contexts,"
said Bullard, a former SEC attorney. "It should be treated no
differently here."</TE>
<TE>   Fidelity spokesman Vin Loporchio said the fund company considers
its proxy votes to be proprietary information and doesn't disclose
specific votes as a matter of policy.</TE>
<TE>   "When we vote proxies, we only consider our mutual fund
shareholders' interests," Loporchio said. While acknowledging that
policy precludes individual shareholders from determining for
themselves whether the fund company's votes benefited them, Loporchio
added, "We feel our policy is in the best interest of our mutual fund
shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   Bullard counters that Fidelity reportedly earned half of its $9.8
billion in revenue from fees paid by companies in which its funds are
invested.</TE>
<TE>   "It, therefore, has an incentive to vote with company management
in order to keep this fee business," Bullard said. "Yet disclosure
rules permit it to keep its conflict of interest secret."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC requires that Wall Street analysts disclose potential
conflicts. Bullard believes the pending mutual fund rule would do no
more than put investment companies on the same playing field.</TE>
<TE>   "This conflict is structurally the same as for analysts who make
false recommendations to bring in investment banking business," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Fund companies argue that disclosing proxy votes politicizes the
process. Besides, few investors seem to care.</TE>
<TE>   "What we hear from our members is that shareholders express little
interest in how proxies are voted," said Chris Wloszczyna, spokesman
for the Investment Company Institute, a Washington trade group
representing the mutual fund industry.</TE>
<TE>   Bullard counters that there wasn't a public outcry demanding
standard disclosure of fund fees or returns, either. But that
standard disclosure has enhanced competition and made it easier for
investors to pick among funds.</TE>
<TE>   "If mass demonstration in the streets were a predicate for
regulatory reform, we wouldn't even have a prospectus," Bullard said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, if this battle is to be won, the voices of individual
investors must be heard above the din of protest from fund companies
that have everything to gain by preserving the status quo, said
Grant, of Pax World. Grant, who runs a socially conscious mutual fund
-- many of which are in favor of the disclosure proposals -- says the
disclosure is simple to do. Both Pax and Domini Investments, another
social fund company, prominently disclose their proxy votes on their
Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   Pax has launched a Web site to make it easy for individual
investors to e-mail comments to the SEC about the disclosure issue.
The site, www.mutualfundproxyvotes.com, has a sample letter and a
prompt that allows investors to send a note directly to the agency's
public comment division. The comment period ends Dec. 6.</TE>

<LD>Stocks notched their third straight winning week as investors
shrugged off mixed economic reports and some downbeat outlooks for
corporate earnings.</LD>
<LD>   For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index gained 1.5%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite
index surged 3.4%. The string of weekly gains follows a six-week
losing streak that drove the major indexes to five- and six-year
lows.</LD>
<LD>   During the recent streak, the Dow industrials have added almost
1,200 points, although the widely watched market barometer is down
15.7% for the year and is on track for its third straight yearly
loss.</LD>

<HD>California Sells First Phase of Bond Deal</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California sold the first phase of its long-awaited $11.9-billion
power bond deal, with about 40 large bond mutual funds snapping up
$4.25 billion of the adjustable-rate securities in just a few hours.</LD>
<LD>   Proceeds from the $11.9-billion power bond sale will repay loans
from banks and the state's general fund that helped the state
purchase power during its energy crisis in 2001. Customers of the
state's major utilities will pay off the bonds through surcharges of
$2.50 to $3.50 in their monthly utility bills.</LD>
<LD>   The successful sale bodes well for the state's planned issue of
$6.75 billion of fixed-rate bonds and $900 million of taxable bonds
during the week of Nov. 4, traders said.</LD>

<HD>Shipping Lines Offer Evidence of Slowdowns</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The shipping industry turned over to the Justice Department what it
calls proof of a "concerted, systematic work slowdown" by the
longshore union since West Coast ports were reopened under a federal
court order Oct. 9.</LD>
<LD>   Despite an injunction calling for work to resume at "a normal and
reasonable rate of speed," the Pacific Maritime Assn. said
productivity per worker dropped by as much as a third in the first
week after the docks reopened. The shipping group said the slower
pace cost shipping lines and terminal operators millions of dollars
and prevented the clearing of a massive backlog of containers.</LD>
<LD>   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union said the claim was
"completely baseless."</LD>
<TE>   Justice Department officials would not comment. However, they
asked for further documentation and warned each side not to destroy
any relevant evidence.</TE>

<LD>Blue Cross of California reached a partial agreement with hospital
operator HCA Inc. in a contract dispute that has been disrupting care
for patients in several California communities.</LD>
<LD>   For weeks, the health-care giants had been at loggerheads over how
much Blue Cross will reimburse HCA for services at its six California
hospitals. Contracts expired Oct. 1, leaving tens of thousands of
Blue Cross members without coverage for most services at the
hospitals, except for emergencies.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiators reached an agreement on a new contract for the three
HCA hospitals in Southern California -- in Riverside, West Hills and
Thousand Oaks. Terms weren't disclosed.</LD>

<LD>Martha Stewart was notified by Securities and Exchange Commission
staffers that they will recommend filing civil insider-trading
charges against the multimedia tycoon in connection with her sale
last December of shares of ImClone Systems Inc., sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The move was a major setback for Stewart, who also is the focus of
a criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the sale
of her ImClone shares. She has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC's enforcement staff this month sent Stewart a formal
notification that the staff is asking the five SEC commissioners for
approval to file civil securities-fraud charges against Stewart, a
source said.</LD>

<LD>Organized labor won the opening salvo in an all-out effort to limit
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s expansion in California, successfully lobbying
the Inglewood City Council to block the nonunion retail giant's plans
to build a super center in that city.</LD>
<LD>   The union representing local supermarket clerks, which recently
raised dues to create a $3-million war chest to fight Wal-Mart's
expansion in California, is now pushing a similar ordinance in the
city of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart recently announced plans to build at least 40 super
centers in California over the next four to six years. The union says
those stores directly compete with union supermarkets and could erode
the union's numbers.</LD>

<LD>Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint alleging that Credit
Suisse First Boston intentionally misled investors by hyping the
stocks of companies for which the firm did investment banking work.</LD>
<LD>   In an administrative complaint, the Massachusetts secretary of
state charged that bankers at CSFB, a unit of Credit Suisse Group,
pressured technology stock analysts to issue upbeat reports on CSFB
clients and then pointed to that bullishness when trying to win
business from other companies.</LD>
<LD>   The charges revolve around a series of e-mails written by CSFB
analysts, some of whom appear to bemoan the pressure they felt to
talk up stocks of CSFB clients.</LD>

<HD>Verdict Against Ford Allowed to Stand</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court declined to review a $290-million
punitive damage verdict against Ford Motor Co., allowing to stand
what the automaker described as the largest personal injury award in
U.S. history to be affirmed on appeal.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-3 decision, issued without comment, left Ford clinging to
hope that the U.S. Supreme Court will review the case, which involved
three family members who died in 1993 when the roof of their Bronco
sport utility vehicle collapsed in a rollover wreck.</LD>
<LD>   Fourteen business groups and companies had filed
friend-of-the-court petitions with the Supreme Court, supporting
Ford's assertion that the verdict was "grossly excessive" and a
threat to all California businesses. Plaintiffs' lawyer Joseph W.
Carcione Jr. called it a "just decision."</LD>

<LD>Acknowledging deeper problems at America Online than previously
reported, AOL Time Warner Inc. said that it would restate eight
quarters of financial results and reduce its revenue by $190 million
as part of an in-house review of its troubled Internet unit, which
also is the focus of federal probes.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, strong earnings for movies, cable TV, broadcasting and
publishing helped offset a sharp advertising slowdown at America
Online, enabling AOL Time Warner to eke out a third-quarter profit of
$57 million, or 1 cent per share, contrasted with a loss of $997
million, or 22 cents a share, a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   AOL Time Warner's EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization -- a common profit yardstick for media
companies -- fell to 19 cents a share from 24 cents a share a year
earlier.</LD>

<LD>Nearly 6,000 people who worked as part-time supervisors at United
Parcel Service Inc. in California are entitled to a share of an
$18-million settlement announced Tuesday in a suit alleging that UPS
violated the state's wage-and-hour laws.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement covers UPS supervisors who were scheduled to work
25 hours a week, earning average monthly salaries of $1,500. The
supervisors had received no additional pay for working more than
their scheduled hours, nor did they receive overtime pay for working
more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week.</LD>

<LD>Dow Chemical Co.'s Union Carbide was found liable for thousands of
asbestos-related illnesses and deaths in a West Virginia trial. A
series of hearings will assess whether damages are warranted in
individual cases, opening the door to millions of dollars in
potential claims.</LD>
<LD>   The trial in Charleston originally was to have pitted more than
8,000 plaintiffs against 250 corporations, including Exxon Mobil
Corp. and Honeywell International Inc. But after failing in a bid to
get the U.S. Supreme Court to block the case, most defendants settled
or had claims against them dismissed.</LD>

<LD>The Times endorses selectively, on a case-by-case basis. Here are
recommendations for the Nov. 5 election.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Measure A</LD>
<TE>   It's scary to imagine what Orange County's political races would
look like without Shirley Grindle, the feisty, sandpaper-voiced
former engineer who has made a second career of scrubbing local
campaigns clean. Her latest attempt, Measure A, is downright tame in
comparison with previous reforms but provides needed updates to
campaign finance law.</TE>
<TE>   When influence-peddling scandals rocked the county Board of
Supervisors in the late 1970s, the volunteer watchdog wrote the TIN
CUP (Time Is Now, Clean Up Politics) campaign-finance reform law that
prohibited supervisors from voting on matters that affected major
campaign contributors. Grindle updated TIN CUP in 1992 to include
political action committees.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Grindle broke new clean-campaign ground in
California with a ban on gifts to county employees. She also co-wrote
a policy preventing former county officials from lobbying the county
for a year after leaving their public jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years after TIN CUP was updated, Grindle offers up Measure A,
which has been dubbed TIN CUP 3. The measure tweaks a few aspects of
the existing law to align it with recent legal decisions. For
example, campaign donations made individually by husband and wife no
longer would be considered as a single contribution; each spouse
would be able to make a separate contribution of up to $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would require candidates to file timely post-election
statements listing campaign contributions and expenditures.
Individual donors also would have to disclose whether they've also
made contributions on behalf of a business.</TE>
<TE>   The most significant section gives the county Board of Supervisors
power to create an independent panel that would investigate
complaints of campaign violations. Normally, this job would fall to
the district attorney, but Tony Rackauckas has made it clear that he
will prosecute only the most serious campaign violations. That makes
sense; it's a waste of public prosecutors' time to chase mundane
failures to put all the correct information on a form.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if no one enforces the law, the door opens to a flood of
disregard for hard-fought campaign reforms. Measure A would give
supervisors the power to create a volunteer panel that would meet to
review complaints. It would have the power to assess fines or order
candidates to return illicit contributions. We're not calling for the
immediate creation of a panel, but it makes sense for supervisors to
be able to react swiftly should the need arise.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance law is a frustrating venture because shrewd
politicians are constantly testing limits. TIN CUP has for more than
20 years kept special interests in check by allowing voters to
scrutinize campaign donations.</TE>
<TE>   The latest version of TIN CUP provides a needed update to the
necessary business of policing campaign financing. Vote yes on
Measure A.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates</TE>
<TE>   The Times endorsed the following candidates for the March primary
and continues to recommend that voters elect:</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court judges</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 22: Kelly Ann Maceachern</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 27: Glenda Sanders</TE>
<TE>   Countywide offices</TE>

<HD>Upgrading the Infrastructure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Infrastructure is usually like the sunny Southern California climate
-- something that busy Orange County residents can take for granted.
Unless, of course, rain forces a weekend picnic at Irvine Park
indoors or the health department cordons off Huntington Beach after a
sewage spill.</LD>
<LD>   We take a lot of things for granted -- that garbage picked up at
the curb will make its way to a suitable landfill and that clean
water will run when the faucet is opened. But basic services aren't a
given; taxpayers must make continuous payments to maintain the
largely hidden infrastructure or face a future cluttered with sewer
line breaks, worn-out classrooms and unsafe bridges.</LD>
<LD>   There's good and bad news on the county's infrastructure front,
according to a six-month study by a UC Irvine-led coalition of
academics, development consultants and public officials. The good
news is that the local infrastructure merits a solid C--in large part
because the county is relatively young. The bad news is that county
schools and a failure to deal with urban runoff generated
near-failing grades.</LD>
<TE>   The results of the study released on Oct. 10 were an offshoot of a
national report card that the American Society of Civil Engineers
began publishing in 2001. Orange County fared better than the nation
-- which earned a D-plus grade that reflects serious infrastructure
deficits in older cities and counties.</TE>
<TE>   The county earned a B for handling water and solid-waste
treatment, but the grade could slip as 7,500 miles of water-main
pipes and 200 drinking-water storage systems age and the county
begins the tough but necessary task of locating future landfills.</TE>
<TE>   The county's wastewater, recreation and transportation
infrastructure merited C grades. A park will blossom on the former El
Toro Marine base, but the county scored a C grade for aviation
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The relatively strong showing was countered by D grades for school
facilities, which researchers described as old, outdated and
overcrowded. The county also came close to an F for failing to
contain urban runoff that threatens to wreck water quality.</TE>
<TE>   Students who've fallen behind on their coursework know the
difficulty of catching up. The same holds true on the county
infrastructure report card. It could cost as much as $1.2 billion to
remedy the D grade for urban runoff. But the alternative -- sitting
back and enjoying the weather -- is going to be even more costly.</TE>

<HD>Worthy Grant for Education</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One sure way to ease the shortage of teachers would be to bless
educators with a hefty increase in pay and prestige. Absent that
unlikely development, school districts and the institutions that
train tomorrow's educators must develop creative programs that will
pull needed teachers into elementary and secondary school classrooms.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Clara Unified School District had the smart idea of
using low-cost housing as bait. The median price of a new home in
Santa Clara has soared to $575,000, so the district is investing $7
million in an apartment building that will provide living space for a
handful of lucky teachers.</LD>
<LD>   Closer to home, Cal State Long Beach has applied for a five-year,
$1.25-million federal grant to identify, recruit and help train
Vietnamese immigrants who taught school before moving to the U.S.
This potential source of experienced educators who lack California
teaching credentials would help to ease a critical teacher shortage
in Westminster and Garden Grove, both home to large Vietnamese
American populations.</LD>
<TE>   The federal government has been talking tough about the growing
shortage of credentialed teachers in California classrooms, and
here's a chance for Uncle Sam to help bridge the gap. The grant would
allow the Vietnamese American Teacher Preparation Project to funnel
as many as 80 additional teachers a year into classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The program would focus on proven teachers, so it won't add to the
parade of recent school of education graduates and older
professionals who are changing careers. These immigrants might not
make an immediate return to the classroom, but with encouragement
they could more quickly navigate the credential process. Cal State
Long Beach reports that many of these potential teachers already are
working as community liaisons, interpreters and volunteer support
staff at school. Some have even been working as bilingual teachers'
aides.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to pushing more teachers into classrooms, the proposed
program would help Garden Grove and Westminster to assemble a cadre
of teachers that more closely resembles their student populations.</TE>
<TE>   The California Teachers Assn. reports that about 80% of
California's teachers are white--a telling statistic given
California's increasingly diverse ethnic mix. Previous grants have
been used to recruit members of other minority groups, including
Latinos and African Americans, to serve as teachers. Given the
pressing need for teachers, this deserving project merits immediate
funding.</TE>

<HD>Measure A Limits Candidates' Free Speech</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "County Campaign Laws Need Update," Oct. 20:</LD>
<LD>   Orange County's proposed Measure A is an attack on free speech.
Your pro-Measure A column fails to reveal its true impact. Measure A
places rigid restrictions on the ability of candidates who don't have
personal wealth to raise money, without controls on wealthy
self-funded candidates. Measure A protects incumbents and assures
that only the rich can afford to run for office.</LD>
<LD>   Measure A makes permanent the $1,000 cap on per-person
contributions. No allowance for inflation. No adjustment by the Board
of Supervisors. While this cap may have made sense 25 years ago, it
now prevents candidates of modest means from keeping up with
escalating campaign costs.</LD>
<TE>   The $1,000 cap does not apply to self-funded candidates or their
spouses. Wealthy candidates have and will contribute lavishly to
their own campaigns, without any legal limits. Free speech is
possible only with adequate resources. All must have an equal ability
to raise the money to get their message to the public.</TE>
<TE>   The $1,000 cap has not made county government more honest. Since
strict campaign limits were implemented in 1978, Orange County has
seen one treasurer jailed and county government declare bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A will limit voter choices. In the March 2002 election,
six of nine county incumbents ran unopposed. As fund-raising becomes
harder for challengers, fewer will run. Uncontested elections will
create more public apathy. Measure A will further drive political
money underground. Prevented from giving openly, donors will
increasingly funnel money through independent expenditure committees.
Campaigns will become dirtier as candidates no longer control money
spent on their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A bans certain slate mailers, whereby candidates and
causes pool resources to share expenses. Slates allow office seekers
with similar values to form coalitions, focusing campaigns on issues
rather than personalities.</TE>
<TE>   Real campaign finance reform should make elections more open,
honest and fair. Measure A does the opposite. Vote no on A.</TE>

<HD>Agran's Role in Irvine's Success</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Now Irvine Mayor Is a Major Player," Oct. 7:</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Larry Agran says he "resents" the reference to him as a
"puppet master." It was Agran himself a number of years ago who
declared that two attorneys with a dedication to their agenda could
totally control a community. He obviously has his agenda, and he now
has his fellow traveler attorney in Chris Mears.</LD>
<LD>   Isn't this just fulfilling his own prophecy? And was not that
prophecy the real "insult to our entire community"?</LD>
<TE>   Secondly, Agran refers to the "new priorities" candidates -- Mike
House for mayor, Christina Shea and Chuck DeVore for council -- as
"blisters, showing up after all the hard work is done." Agran goes on
to say, "I don't recall a single instance in which they took part in
that campaign."</TE>
<TE>   The main difference between Christina Shea when she was mayor and
Larry Agran as mayor is that Shea actually put together the coalition
of South County cities and officials and was recognized and
acknowledged as the leader of that group while not worrying about who
would get credit. She was consumed with getting the job done. In her
world there was credit enough for all to share.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Quigley</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite the naysayers, Agran will not be swayed from his visions
for the masterfully planned Irvine, which continues to be a
beautiful, ever more vibrant city under Agran's guidance. With the
realization that he was spearheading the drive to stop the El Toro
airport, I became confident that there would be no airport.</TE>
<TE>   It is dismaying to read that Christina Shea and her cohorts claim
they had a hand in stopping El Toro. As someone who followed events
closely, I don't recall anything significant being done by them. As
for Shea's comments about keeping Irvine a sprawling, green
community: Who would not like to think Irvine could stay the place it
was 20 years ago?</TE>
<TE>   In anticipation of inevitable change, during his first term as
mayor of Irvine, Larry Agran was instrumental in forging the
agreements that led to the 34% permanent open space that Irvine now
enjoys. Agran has never lost his willingness and drive to work for
the betterment of Irvine, despite a very vocal and strident group of
dissenters. He deserves, and is to be congratulated for, becoming a
major player in Orange County politics.</TE>
<TE>   Dixie Mitchell</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Irvine and Orange County voters would do well to remember Agran's
comments in 1989 to the National Lawyers' Guild: "As an attorney
myself, I've concluded one of the most important things we can do as
attorneys is to take control of local government. Most smaller cities
or medium-sized cities can be easily controlled politically with
about five lawyers and some of their supporters. It's probably easier
if you have only three lawyers and their supporters, and you can just
decide what kind of community you want to live in." It sort of gives
a new meaning to "do it my way."</TE>
<TE>   Arden Reynolds</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We have lived in Irvine since 1966 and are pleased with the way
our city has grown in the area of cultural diversity. In today's
world, this is what makes a city rich in so many ways.</TE>
<TE>   It was with horror that we read the statement from the "new
priorities" team running for elected office in Irvine that "holding
taxpayer-sponsored multicultural events at the City Hall" was a waste
of taxpayers' money. We attended such an event at City Hall this
year, and the richness of the variety of cultures represented made us
realize that we were indeed fortunate to live in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Angelo and Marilyn Vassos</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is true that Proposition 51 is an undisguised boondoggle, a
scam, an unconscionable pork barrel that cripples the state budget
process and bypasses debate in the elected Legislature. The measure
depletes the general funds of the state by a permanent diversion of
$910 million every year. It rewards those who were in on its writing,
and those who paid for the gathering of signatures, with pet
projects. At 25 pages and nine times longer than the average ballot
proposition, it contains 212 specific projects that must be funded.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor of Irvine was on the board of the group that wrote
Proposition 51. Many Orange County residents are angered at what is
seen as Machiavellian scheming on the part of Mayor Larry Agran. But
being angry is nonproductive and misses an important point.</TE>
<TE>   Those who complain about Agran should remember that Niccolo
Machiavelli was a highly intelligent, dedicated patriot who spent his
life in efforts to protect his native city and its independence. The
citizens of Costa Mesa and Newport Beach ought not be angry but
should be envious, and maybe ashamed, that none of our mayors has
ever been a match for Niccolo Machiavelli or for Larry Agran.</TE>

<LD>Re: "O.C. Judge Race Takes 2nd Ugly Turn," Oct. 15:</LD>
<LD>   One gets used to the mudslinging in political races, but for a
Superior Court judge? And hiring a private detective to dig up mud to
smear on an opponent should turn every voter's stomach and bring out
a sympathy vote for the victim!</LD>
<LD>   I've known John Adams for more than 15 years -- first as a client
and later as a business associate. In all those years John has shown
himself to be a man of integrity, one who really cares about his
fellow human beings.</LD>
<TE>   To distort mistakes of the kind we all make is politics at its
worst.</TE>

<TE>   You chose the right word in your headline: "ugly" is an apt
description of Gay Sandoval's actions in attempting to discredit John
Adams with disclosures concerning a private family financial
arrangement between Mr. Adams and his parents.</TE>
<TE>   His creditors were satisfied, so where's the problem?</TE>
<TE>   The willingness and financial ability of his parents to assist him
during a difficult period 10 to 12 years ago has no bearing on Mr.
Adams' qualifications.</TE>

<TE>   The article mistakenly implied that my son and judicial candidate,
John Adams, allowed us to be thrown out on the street. Nothing could
be further from the truth.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, my husband, John Adams Sr., was in business with
our son at the time, and the McDaniels were friends of ours. As
business reverses developed in the economic downturn of the early
1990s, we approached the McDaniels for a loan. They provided funds
secured by a rental home we owned as collateral. My husband and I had
lived in this home for 12 years before purchasing our current home in
Laguna Beach in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   After refusing to renegotiate the terms of the loan during
continued hardship, the McDaniels foreclosed on the rental property.
They were more than made whole. Our former home easily doubled in
value and always delivered a substantial stream of rental income.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was his divorce a bitter dispute. Our son installed his former
wife in a beautiful home and paid $1,000 a month in support for his
only child. He also paid for her education at USC.</TE>
<TE>   The McDaniels' vicious vendetta and tireless pursuit of anything
damaging to our son and family have no place in this campaign.</TE>

<LD>Re "Pet Adoption Made Easier by Volunteers at Rescue Web Site," Oct.
13:</LD>
<LD>   I am writing to tell you about a wonderful thing that happened as
a result of this article. As it happened, I had planned to go to the
Orange County shelters to adopt two cats.</LD>
<LD>   I decided to go to that Web site. The information there was
overwhelming. There were links to shelters and an address where you
could send an e-mail if you were looking for a specific kind of
animal.</LD>
<TE>   That's what I did.</TE>
<TE>   I received an immediate response from many people and am still
getting calls and e-mails today.</TE>
<TE>   Yesterday, I adopted two beautiful 3-year-old cats. This is a
direct result of the article in The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The woman who called me runs Chihuahua Rescue in Burbank. She was
at the animal shelter rescuing a dog when a man came in with two cats
he wanted euthanized because his daughter was allergic.</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't rescue cats but was concerned because they were
healthy, wonderful cats. She took them and boarded them at her dog
kennel, hoping to find them a home. She called me just a few days
later, and now they are a part of my home.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks for bringing us together.</TE>

<LD>Re "Latino Caucus Won't Support Davis Reelection," Oct. 5: As a
Democrat, I was surprised by the quote in The Times by Sen. Richard
Polanco (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los
Angeles) stating that they were "unable" to endorse Gray Davis
because of the governor's veto regarding legislation permitting some
illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.</LD>
<LD>   They stated that the "vetoes contradict our Democratic core value
of inclusion." Since when did the Democratic Party openly stand for
anything illegal?</LD>

<TE>   Re "Davis for Reelection," Oct. 15:</TE>
<TE>   I was disappointed to read your recommendations. The general
feeling of Californians is neither Gray Davis nor Bill Simon is a
good candidate. Both have notoriously poor track records. And yet The
Times wants to reward Davis' multibillion-dollar mistake, purchasing
energy contracts at the highest prices during our so-called energy
crisis, with another four years. If Davis is so "in tune" with the
environment, why did he ignore his election promise to preserve
California's old-growth trees?</TE>
<TE>   Neither candidate has any notable merit to stand on. Neither
candidate takes a stand on an issue; instead, both point out each
other's flaws. Neither candidate has any new ideas. Now is the time
to consider third-party candidates who offer fresh ideas, such as
Peter Camejo, who not only has a successful business record, but also
actually has a platform and takes positions on issues.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Campaign Imperfect," Oct. 14:</TE>
<TE>   When the most populous state goes from a billion-dollar surplus to
a multibillion-dollar deficit, there is something wrong with the
government. Maybe it is time that Davis starts running ads about his
party and what he is going to do to reverse this substantial loss,
rather then running ads about Simon. The state of California needs a
chance, and as far as I am concerned, anything is better than Davis.</TE>

<LD>Re "Faulty Pump-Outs Are Blamed in Sewage Dumps," Oct. 17:</LD>
<LD>   As frustrated boat owners, we were pleased to see the problem of
inoperative harbor boat pump-out stations recognized in your paper.</LD>
<LD>   It is very discouraging to go from Avalon, Catalina Island, where
the harbor patrol drops dye pellets in boaters' heads (toilets) to
make sure one does not accidentally pump any waste into the harbor
... to our mainland marinas, where inoperative, ineffective, or
inconvenient pump-out stations are the rule!</LD>
<TE>   Though it is legal to empty boat holding tanks overboard when at
least three miles from the coast, we try to avoid that so we don't
add to the partially treated sewage our cities are already pumping
into the ocean from treatment plant outfalls just four miles out from
our beaches.</TE>
<TE>   However, the generally sad state of most pump-out stations in our
marinas makes it difficult for concerned boaters to try to preserve
our oceans and therefore, our beaches.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps we need a state-mandated requirement to keep these
pump-out stations up to par at all times.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of pollution, what are the scores of freighters anchored
just off our beaches doing with their sewage?</TE>

<LD>Re "Education Cash Awards Suspended," Oct. 18:</LD>
<LD>   Is Arthur Andersen in charge of the state budget? On one hand, the
"state's budget crisis has made it impossible to fund" the promised
educational cash awards. On the other hand, in Crystal Cove the state
parks department apparently has been budgeted enough money to
reconstruct the dilapidated beach homes (vintage 1900s) to bring back
a nostalgic feeling for beach-goers in the future. Enough already;
those homes should be flattened, removed and coastal sage planted to
return the beach to its natural state. Throw in a couple of restrooms
and trash barrels.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Don't Let the Schools Down," Oct. 13:</LD>
<LD>   I served as the Santa Ana schools' assistant superintendent of
facilities from 1989 to April 2000. During that time, Santa Ana
Unified constructed 19 new schools. As the editorial stated, the
district passed a $145-million local bond measure in November 1999
but has built no new schools in the last three years and has no
projects under construction. What happened?</LD>
<LD>   Quite simply, Santa Ana Unified School Board members John Palacio
and Nativo Lopez usurped the authority of the district's
administration and decided to manage this multimillion-dollar public
works program themselves. Unfortunately, neither of them possesses
any qualifications to assume such a responsibility.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, state funding application deadlines have been missed,
projects have experienced massive cost overruns even before they have
been built, and the district's facilities department has seen a major
"brain drain" as competent, experienced managers depart in
frustration.</TE>
<TE>   I now manage the facility program at Vista Unified School District
in north San Diego County. In March 2002, our community passed a
local bond measure. Within six months, the district had three new
schools under construction, and we will start a fourth new school
project before Thanksgiving. This is what happens when the school
board allows its professional facility managers to do their jobs. I
only hope that Santa Ana Unified has learned this lesson.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Small Districts' Views on Proposition 47," October 17:</LD>
<LD>   Larry Stein is misinformed on his facts about who gets the bulk of
the state bond money for schools. The truth is that the smaller
school districts of the Inland Empire have received hundreds of
millions of dollars in funding to build new schools as a result of
rapid residential development. San Bernardino and Riverside County
school districts have depended heavily on state funds to build and
modernize older facilities. San Diego Unified has received relatively
little in funding since it only recently became active in the state's
school building program. Many local school bonds depend upon state
matching funds to complete their building program. Without a state
match available, voters will find their dreams unfulfilled.</LD>

<LD>Re "Afghan Trips Become Election Issue," Oct. 14:</LD>
<LD>   I guess Jean O. Pasco searched in vain for just one of Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher's local constituents who actually believe he is doing a
good job. He keeps getting reelected, so there has to be someone in
his district who could say something positive. Here's a clue from her
article: "Rohrabacher, who had been dismissed by many as a far-right
ideologue ...."</LD>
<LD>   Is it possible to do a global search on The Times' computers to
determine if the following words have ever been used in one of your
articles: "dismissed by many as a far-left ideologue"? I suspect such
a person doesn't exist in the minds of Times staff writers.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, with your recent change in format, wouldn't it have been
a good time to move "Doonesbury" and "Boondocks" to the editorial
page? Or perhaps, for balance, you could just include a couple of
far-right ideologue artists to share their political agendas in the
comic pages.</TE>

<LD>Re "Agency Lost Contact on 3,000 Kids, It Says," October 13:</LD>
<LD>   It is unbelievable that child care agencies have lost contact with
3,000 kids. That just goes to show that they are not doing their job
and the government should check their work more often. Social workers
should be a little more careful about where they place kids and who
they place people with, because those people may not always be the
right parents for some kids.</LD>

<HD>Environment, Economy Must Be Able to Coexist</HD>
<DH>The basic premise that the economy and the environment are
in conflict is a throwback to 30 years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis J. Aigner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The League of Conservation Voters' National Environmental Scorecard,
which reviews the voting records of U.S. representatives and senators
on key environmental issues, underscores that political party
affiliation and region strongly predict how politicians will vote on
environmental issues in Congress.</LD>
<LD>   And Republicans clearly have a poor environmental record. For
example, Democratic senators in seven Western states (including
Alaska and Hawaii, states whose senators have strong anti-environment
voting records) voted in favor of environmental issues 74% of the
time during the 106th Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Republican senators from the West scored only 13%, on average.
During the 2001 session of the 107th Congress the numbers were 79%
for Democrats and 12% for Republicans.</LD>
<TE>   What is it that makes the Republicans much less environmentally
oriented? If President Bush is a good indicator, the answer is
simple: The economy and the environment are in conflict, and he'll
take the economy every time.</TE>
<TE>   This interpretation is completely consistent with Bush's
statements on such things as the energy crisis in California (it was
the Golden State's decision to have more stringent environmental
standards, after all), capping carbon dioxide emissions from
fossil-fuel-burning power plants and pulling America out of the Kyoto
Protocol (it would be bad for the economy).</TE>
<TE>   It is not reflective, however, of the attitudes of the American
people, who continue to think that environmental protection should be
a priority even at the risk of curbing economic growth (Gallup Poll)
and who oppose Bush's decision not to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
from power plants (Los Angeles Times national poll).</TE>
<TE>   On the local level, Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove) voted yes on
13 of the 14 environmental bills that the League of Conservation
Voters tracked in 2000, for a score of 93%. Over both sessions of the
106th Congress (1999 and 2000), she voted in favor of 83% of the key
environmental bills considered by the House. So far in the 107th
Congress (2001), her voting record on environmental bills is
consistent: all yes.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), Dana Rohrabacher
(R-Huntington Beach) and Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) have strong voting
records against environmental legislation. In the 106th Congress, Cox
and Rohrabacher voted in favor of environmental bills only 10% of the
time; Royce's score was just 13%. In the first session of the 107th
Congress, Rohrabacher voted yes on one environmental bill; Royce and
Cox voted against all 14 that were considered.</TE>
<TE>   It is presumptuous to think that all environmental bills ought to
be passed. Like any other area of policymaking, the environment is
not immune from badly drafted legislation and the regrettable
preponderance of pork. But the voting patterns are striking and
suggest that the vast majority of Republican legislators operate from
a mind-set not unlike the president's.</TE>
<TE>   The exceptions are found in the House, where a number of
Republican representatives from states like Connecticut, New Jersey,
New York and a few others have strong pro-environment voting records.</TE>
<TE>   The basic premise that the economy and the environment are in
conflict is a throwback to 30 years ago. A great deal of progress has
been made since the establishment of the Environmental Protection
Agency in 1970 (during the Nixon administration) and the subsequent
enactment of much stricter environmental laws.</TE>
<TE>   The adversarial relationship between American industry and the EPA
that continues in large part to this day unfortunately helps support
the view that in order to get environmental benefits, one must pay an
economic price.</TE>
<TE>   Yet over the past decade there have been numerous examples of
companies innovating in response to environmental regulation and, by
doing so, either saving money or creating new revenue streams.</TE>
<TE>   Another important trend is "design for the environment," in which
product design pays attention to the entire product lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's commercial building design and the move to "green"
buildings for energy efficiency, buildings that use recycled and
recyclable products and, most important, buildings that cost no more
than conventional construction.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, there are companies that have decided to lead the
charge in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and on other facets of
"greening" in spite of the Bush administration's lack of leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the power of the presidency to "spin" the facts, what is
really happening is a trend toward embracing the environment and
sustainability as central business issues rather than peripheral
ones. As the power of industry is brought solidly behind good
environmental practice, "environment and economy" becomes the
operative phrase.</TE>
<TE>   While such issues as school vouchers and the partial privatization
of Social Security represent philosophical departures between
Republicans and Democrats, there is no philosophical basis for
disagreement about the environment. We are treating the planet as if
it were a "business in liquidation," to borrow from the book "Natural
Capitalism" by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and L. Hunter Lovins. As our
natural capital declines, so does our conventional economic capacity.
And that's bad for business, whatever one's political persuasion.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Voters Can Use Ballots to Change Legislative Spending</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steven B. Frates</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County voters could certainly be forgiven if they approached
the upcoming elections with dread. The local citizenry shovels tax
dollars to Sacramento at a prodigious rate, while their legislative
delegation consistently manages to ensure that precious few of those
tax dollars return to constituents.</LD>
<LD>   Republican legislators mumble that AB 8 (the infamous legislation
concocted in 1978 by legislative staffers after voters passed
Proposition 13) prevents the county from getting anything close to
its fair share of state money. Democratic legislators revel in
chairing "important committees." Easily manipulated, the county's
Democratic state legislators rather remind one of small children who
are given a cheap toy as a diversion, while more competent adults
make serious decisions.</LD>
<LD>   The local legislative delegation may be beyond redemption, but
here are several hints to stir them from somnambulism:</LD>
<TE>   Hint No. 1: AB 8 was enacted by the Legislature, which can change
such legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Hint No. 2: Because of AB 8, every Southern California county gets
a raw deal from the state.</TE>
<TE>   Hint No. 3: More Californians live in Southern California than in
Northern California. Hint No. 4: There are more state legislators
from Southern California than from Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with this information, the average high school civics
student could conclude that legislators from Southern California
could, if they were competent, change the flow of state cash to
benefit their constituents. This distorted appropriation of state
funds has been going on for about 25 years. It is past time for the
local legislative delegation and their Southern California colleagues
to correct this imbalance.</TE>
<TE>   The local legislative delegation will probably whine that nothing
can be done about AB 8 (and subsequent legislative offspring) this
year because of the "budget crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed. One might wonder how a state government that had a huge
surplus just a few years ago could so quickly be in a financial
crisis. One might not be too surprised to know that the Legislature
has managed to increase spending very rapidly in the last few years.
More rapidly, in fact, than the growth of personal income among all
Californians. Guess which Californians will be paying a
disproportionate share of taxes to fund the legislative spending
spree?</TE>
<TE>   While there are all too many examples in the last two years of
legislative profligacy with taxpayer dollars, Orange County citizens
who have suffered from a decrease in their retirement portfolios
might particularly wish to consider how their legislators voted on
the recently enacted AB 2023. In California, police officers and
firefighters are eligible, if the governing city council or county
board of supervisors approves, to retire at age 50 with 3% of their
highest year's pay credited for each year of service.</TE>
<TE>   So, for example, a firefighter who started at age 20 could retire
at age 50 and receive 90% of his or her yearly salary annually in
retirement. This is a very generous pension, by any measure. It is
certainly true, however, that police officers and firefighters need
to be reasonably young and physically fit to carry out their duties.
AB 2023 extended these same retirement benefits to district attorneys
and public defenders, who certainly do not need to be young or
physically fit. And, local taxpayers will be on the hook to finance
this lavish retirement benefit for these "public safety" attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the Legislature is not the only source of dread for
Orange County voters. Proposition 51, a statewide initiative, would
redirect tax revenue generated from the sale of new and used motor
vehicles. Currently, such sales taxes go to the state general fund.
Cynics might say that Prop. 51 makes a clever play on public
dissatisfaction with the fact that the state Legislature imposes a
general sales tax on gasoline. But Proposition 51 does not address
that problem.</TE>
<TE>   What Prop. 51 does is direct sales tax (but not the dreaded motor
vehicle license tax) paid on motor vehicles to a mishmash of special
interest "transportation" projects. By odd coincidence, the advocates
of Prop. 51 collected huge amounts of money from the beneficiaries of
these special interest projects. By yet another odd coincidence, none
of these special-interest projects would otherwise be funded by the
taxpayers. By a final odd coincidence, more than $200 million of
these special interest projects would go to Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if Prop. 51 passes, taxpayers in other cities will have
to make up the difference for legitimate projects that lost funding
to Prop. 51 special interest projects.</TE>
<TE>   If you like higher taxes, and less money from Sacramento, by all
means vote for our incumbent state legislators. If you want more of
your tax dollars to go to Irvine, and less to the rest of Orange
County, by all means vote for Prop. 51.</TE>

<HD>Chargers Getting Passing Grade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Oates</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With quarterback Brian Griese apparently in sharp comeback form, the
Denver Broncos will face Super Bowl quarterback Tom Brady at New
England today in the AFC game of the week.</LD>
<LD>   But regardless of how well they play, the Broncos won't be able to
dislodge the San Diego Chargers from first place this week in the AFC
West.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in his long career, San Diego Coach Marty
Schottenheimer, who draws a bye today, has a complete team that can
pass, run and play defense well enough -- without its best player,
linebacker Junior Seau -- to upset the Oakland Raiders.</LD>
<TE>   The pass plays that San Diego used last week to win, 27-21, were
as well thought out as they were brightly polished.</TE>
<TE>   One, called at the Oakland three-yard line, was a slow-developing
play that required San Diego's linemen to hold their blocks while
running back LaDainian Tomlinson faked a block until he could sneak
into the end zone for quarterback Drew Brees' touchdown pass.</TE>
<TE>   For a team that might be en route to a new home in
entertainment-capital Los Angeles, that was sufficiently
sophisticated.</TE>
<TE>   Change of Strategy</TE>
<TE>   Few football fans expect the 6-1 Chargers to hold first place
forever against the 4-2 Raiders or the 5-2 Broncos, who, still
favored in the AFC West, beat 3-4 Kansas City last Sunday, 37-34, on
Griese's passes to tight end Shannon Sharpe.</TE>
<TE>   As Schottenheimer knows, he's in a respectable division.</TE>
<TE>   In his Kansas City days, he coached the Chiefs into the playoffs
seven times. At 59, he's been in the playoffs 11 winters in all, more
than any other active coach. The difference at San Diego is that with
Brees pitching, he has a pass offense.</TE>
<TE>   With their old horse-and-buggy offense in Kansas City, his teams
were locked out of every Super Bowl and into every conservative's
dream world. As those people invariably say -- and Schottenheimer was
once one of them -- their life's goal is to run the ball and stop the
run.</TE>
<TE>   He changed his philosophy in Kansas City too late to drive the
Chiefs into the NFL championship game.</TE>
<TE>   His old associates said it was in Schottenheimer's 10th and final
year in Missouri that he finally identified passing as the weapon of
decision. You can run your way into the playoffs, they said he'd said
then, but not into the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Having proved this in his first 16 NFL seasons, he's throwing a
lot now with Brees. And still running, of course, with Tomlinson.</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, Tomlinson had everything but the will to mix it up
with the big guys in the closeness of contact. Or so it looked. But
he's changed too, along with his coach. It's a new day in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Suspensions Hurt</TE>
<TE>   One reason Denver struggled a week ago in Kansas City is that it
was minus its strong safety, the defensive player who on any NFL team
is instrumental. Kenoy Kennedy was benched that day by the NFL, which
ruled that he had been making too many head-to-head hits.</TE>
<TE>   Those are not only illegal in pro football but unquestionably
unsporting.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy was fined $25,000, not harsh enough, and suspended for one
game, too harsh.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the predictable reaction in Denver, strong NFL action was
necessary. The first game-time responsibility of the league, as
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue acknowledges, is to keep its artists
alive and playing football.</TE>
<TE>   And that can be properly done only with heavy fines that
discourage scofflaws.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with a player suspension is that it penalizes the team
as well as the player. A number of innocent people go down with the
one convict.</TE>
<TE>   Nor, to maintain order, are suspensions required. Fines accomplish
the same thing -- if they're large enough.</TE>
<TE>   The only reason I can think of that Kennedy keeps hitting people
illegally -- when he knows it will cost him a bunch of money -- is
that it doesn't cost him enough money. He should have been fined
$50,000 or more, whatever it takes.</TE>
<TE>   He was the one at fault, not his team, and not the football fans
of Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska Sounder</TE>
<TE>   A college coach, Frank Solich of Nebraska, also faced a
disciplinary problem this month and handled it with greater wisdom,
which, perhaps, is more than can be said for his approach to Xs and
O's.</TE>
<TE>   In the Oklahoma State game Saturday, Solich started his
first-string quarterback, Jammal Lord, despite calls for Lord's
suspension.</TE>
<TE>   The player had been cited for "disturbing the peace" with a
girlfriend, Nebraska volleyball player Greichaly Cepero, in his
apartment one morning three hours after midnight. Complicating
Solich's troubles, the volleyball coach did suspend Cepero, the
team's best player.</TE>
<TE>   There are better ways than suspensions to discipline college
athletes. Better ways, that is, so long as their infractions --
parking in handicapped-parking spaces or whatever -- don't land them
in jail.</TE>
<TE>   All college players, for example, have privileges that can be
restricted, particularly on trips. For some infractions, a coach can
refuse to award the guilty letter winner a letter. And there are
other measures.</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers, true, didn't need quarterback Lord to help them
lose to Oklahoma State, but if he's the best they have he gave them
their best shot in a game they lost, 24-21.</TE>
<TE>   Suspensions are simply too unfair to the other players on the team
and to the college itself, as well as to the team's fans. Suspensions
are as unfair as they are unnecessary -- in either college or pro
ball.</TE>
<TE>   Rams Coming?</TE>
<TE>   The Rams keep cutting into the 49ers' lead in the NFC West, where
after starting 0-5 they have won their last two and are 2-5 in the
standings behind co-leaders San Francisco and Arizona. The 49ers and
Cardinals, both 4-2, meet in the NFC's game of the week today.</TE>
<TE>   So the question for the Rams suddenly is whether they're too far
out of it to catch up.</TE>
<TE>   They do have the tools to get back, and stranger things have
happened, if not lately.</TE>
<TE>   Their most important new tool is quarterback Marc Bulger, who in
Week 7 won his second game, leading the Rams past Seattle, 37-20.</TE>
<TE>   One play in the Seattle game tells Ram fans plenty about Bulger.</TE>
<TE>   At a key moment, he hit wide receiver Terry Holt with a deep
corner throw that measured more than half the field, at least 52
yards. Setting up a touchdown, the ball was in the air a good 65
yards on a pass that was as perfectly thrown as any last year by
injured starter Kurt Warner.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, during a critical series in the Seattle red zone, Ram
Coach Mike Martz showed that he hasn't lost his touch, whatever his
critics like to say about him. With his calls in that series, Martz
provided a clinic look at how to run the ball on goal-line plays when
passing seems inadvisable. In a two-play sequence:</TE>
<TE>   * First, the Ram coach put Bulger in an empty-backfield formation,
faking pass, and had him hand off to the motion man, Marshall Faulk,
who ran the ball to the three-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   * Next, faking pass again, Martz sent Faulk racing into the end
zone on a draw play.</TE>
<TE>   The playoffs need the excitement that Martz brings to the game.
It's a longshot that might happen.</TE>
<TE>   QB Like Statue</TE>
<TE>   At Tampa, the new coach, Jon Gruden, doesn't seem to be getting
the most out of his talent -- a crucial aspect of the job that helped
make him a winner at Oakland. Last week, as the Philadelphia Eagles
beat Tampa Bay without an offensive touchdown by the Buccaneers,
20-10, it was obvious again that immobility in the quarterback
position inhibits their chance to win.</TE>
<TE>   Gruden's starter, Brad Johnson, though as accurate as some of the
league's best quarterbacks, is strictly a pocket passer who, under a
rush, is more statue than quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   If Johnson can't move, backup Rob Johnson apparently can't impress
Gruden.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the best quarterback in Tampa has been Shaun King since
the Buccaneers drafted him four years ago. As a passer, King yields
to the Johnsons, most critics believe, but in today's football it
doesn't help much if a quarterback can pass but can't move -- and
King moves with distinction.</TE>
<TE>   Five Guesses</TE>
<TE>   Best of Week 8: A reader says she'd like some words on what's
ahead, not just on what has happened. So here are five guesses on the
five most interesting pro games today:</TE>
<TE>   * Denver by three over New England at Foxboro: Although at
quarterback the Patriots' Tom Brady might be No. 1 in the NFL, his
support network isn't as strong as Bronco quarterback Brian Griese's.
And now that they've lost three in a row, the defending champions'
confidence may be as shaky as their defense. If they beat Denver,
they'll win most of the rest.</TE>
<TE>   * San Francisco by 10 over Arizona at 3Com Park: The surprise team
of the National Football Conference -- tied now with the 49ers for
first in the NFC West -- the Cardinals lack the defense to contain
the 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   * Oakland by five over Kansas City at Arrowhead Stadium: Will we
see the Oakland that beat Buffalo, 49-31, and Tennessee, 52-25, or
the Oakland that lost its last two? That is the question. Next year,
the Chiefs will be a title-game contender. Not yet. Nor am I ready
yet to give up on Rich Gannon or Jerry Rice. After today, maybe.</TE>
<TE>   * Baltimore by three over Pittsburgh at Ravens Stadium: The
difference here could be the Steeler defense, which doesn't yet look
quite right.</TE>
<TE>   * New Orleans by seven over Atlanta at the Louisiana Superdome:
Now that Atlanta's young quarterback Michael Vick has warmed up
against a couple of teams the Falcons can beat, it will be
interesting to see how far he extends himself against a team they
can't beat.</TE>

<HD>Helping Their Homeland, One Girl at a Time</HD>
<DH>Group founded by expatriates runs 200 schools in
illiteracy- plagued Pakistan -- their way of seeking to better the
nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is something alluring about the simplicity of Fiza Shah's work.
Teach a girl to read. It sounds simple enough. But in that act are
the seeds of revolution.</LD>
<LD>   Shah and the other founders of Developments in Literacy say that
education is the key to reform in their native Pakistan: the first
step in lifting that country from Third World status. More than 100
million Pakistanis are illiterate, and two of every three Pakistani
girls lack formal schooling. The number is worse in rural areas.</LD>
<LD>   "The literacy rate in Pakistan is so low," said Hashmat Saeed, a
Long Beach resident and the organization's treasurer. "We wanted to
give something back to the country where we were born."</LD>
<TE>   In 1997, Shah, Saeed and 11 other women, all born in Pakistan and
now Southern California residents, decided that the best way they
could help their homeland was to help its girls. They established the
literacy group to take education to girls in the countryside.</TE>
<TE>   For five years, they have worked and watched as their dream has
become reality. The organization, once run out of members' homes, now
runs offices in Los Angeles and Islamabad. Affiliate chapters have
sprung up in six U.S. cities and in Singapore. More than 10,000 girls
have walked through the doors of the group's schools.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Shah, a Long Beach resident who has lived in the United
States for 22 years, is traveling in Pakistan, visiting all of the
organization's 151 schools and overseeing plans to open 40 more.
"When you really are doing hands-on work, you have to go there
yourself and see it to understand," said Shah, 42, who credits a
family that honored charitable service for her sense of obligation to
Pakistan's girls.</TE>
<TE>   There are many reasons, Shah continued, why parents -- fathers,
especially -- try to prevent daughters from attending school. The
girls are needed to do housework. They are to be married (rural
Pakistanis girls are often pledged to marry between the ages of 11
and 13).</TE>
<TE>   So the Developments in Literacy staff working in Pakistan employs
a tactic that has served it well: Find a prominent village elder and
convince him of the positive effects of educating a girl. If you
convince him, Shah said, the parents might follow his example.</TE>
<TE>   Educated women, she said, bring in money for their family. The
literacy group's teachers are usually local residents with 10 to 14
years of schooling. Once these women start earning salaries, friends
and families no longer see them as a burden.</TE>
<TE>   "They are helping out the family, and the whole dynamic changes,"
Shah said. Girls whose parents can barely afford to feed them now
dream of becoming teachers or doctors. "We have found a tremendous
change in the mentality of the girls," she said. "And that's how you
start."</TE>
<TE>   Shah, the daughter of a Pakistani diplomat and the mother of two
college-age sons, carries her own images of education and
transformation, stored on a sleek laptop computer that accompanies
her on her travels.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, she sat in the ornate dining room of her Long
Beach home, tapping away at keys until a photo appeared.</TE>
<TE>   "Here," she said, turning the screen. An image appeared, of a bare
one-room classroom. A group of girls sat cross-legged on the floor,
perched on straw mats.</TE>
<TE>   But the rudimentary conditions were not the reason Shah had chosen
the photo. She pointed at the girls. "Look at these faces," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And that's when the girls came into focus: They were all smiling.
Their bright eyes and rosy cheeks seemed to brim with enthusiasm for
their teacher and their classroom.</TE>
<TE>   The women of Developments in Literacy use such images and stories,
in conversation and on the group's Web site, www.4dil.org, to
illustrate their mission and attract potential donors. "Once they see
what we are doing and hear about the kids, and see the pictures, the
videos," it is easy to ask for money, said an Orange resident,
Perveen Ali, vice president of the organization's Los Angeles
chapter.</TE>
<TE>   "Even my mother is involved in it. She [funds] a school there --
wants to know how she can improve the building for the kids," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Developments in Literacy is in many ways an easy sell, thanks in
part to a strong U.S. dollar and inexpensive Pakistani overhead.
Forty dollars will send a girl to school for a year. Funding an
entire primary school for a year costs $1,000. Girls receive their
education free -- though often, Shah said, families are asked to
contribute 5 rupees a year (about 8 cents).</TE>
<TE>   "That's as much as it costs for a cup of tea," Shah said of the
charge, which is imposed more as an incentive to continue a
daughter's education than to cover costs. "If that pinches them a
slight bit," she said, "they make sure the girls go."</TE>
<TE>   Although most of the group's $350,000 budget is raised from family
and friends, the organization has begun seeking long-term grants. The
Levi Strauss Foundation has contributed. So too has NetAid, a New
York-based nonprofit organization, which gave $53,000.</TE>
<TE>   Developments in Literacy leaders are talking with the Pakistani
government about helping some state-run schools. And they hope to
establish a nutritional program that would feed girls before school.</TE>
<TE>   That's one project that excites Ali, the vice president of the Los
Angeles chapter. "Here we take so much for granted," she said. "I end
up telling my kids, 'Don't throw any food away.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ali is planning a trip to Pakistan next summer with her
children -- two boys and a daughter -- so they can see what their
mother's hard work has accomplished and what they have gained by being
raised in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the events that are happening in the world, you feel
every little bit you can contribute is worth it," Ali said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have lived here so long, I can't imagine. What if I had been
back there?"</TE>

<HD>Philip Brett, 64; Stressed Role of Sexuality in Study of
Music</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Woo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip Brett, a UCLA musicologist who shook the foundations of his
discipline by advocating the importance of gender and sexuality in
the study of music, died of cancer Oct. 16 at his home in Los
Angeles. He was 64.</LD>
<LD>   In 1976, Brett provoked the ire of traditionalists when he openly
discussed the homosexuality of Benjamin Britten, one of 20th century
England's most prominent composers, arguing in lectures and a
scholarly paper that Britten's hidden sexual identity permeated his
works.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, many scholars have embraced Brett's approach, giving
rise to the field now known as the new musicology, a branch of
scholarship that broadens the understanding of musical compositions
through feminist, gender and cultural studies.</LD>
<TE>   "He was the first person to discuss the relationship of musicality
and homosexuality within a musicological venue," said Byron Adams,
chairman of the music department at UC Riverside. "It was radical and
incredibly courageous."</TE>
<TE>   Brett also was an authority on the music of the English
Renaissance, a Grammy-nominated choral conductor and an accomplished
keyboardist.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Edwinstowe, England, he was the son of a coal miner and a
schoolteacher. Recognizing his musical abilities, his parents gave
him piano lessons and enrolled him in a choir school when he was 7.</TE>
<TE>   At 15, Brett went to Cambridge University, earning his bachelor's,
master's and doctoral degrees from King's College. After he did
research at UC Berkeley, he was invited to join its faculty in 1966.
He would spend nearly all of his 36-year career in the UC system.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after he relocated to the United States, the contemporary
gay rights movement was born during a 1969 riot at the Stonewall bar
in New York City. Brett began a period of self-examination and, in
1973, came out as gay.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, when the American Musicological Society asked for papers
about American music or European composers in America, he combined
his musicological training and his newfound gay identity to write
about Britten, who had composed one of his greatest operas, "Peter
Grimes," in California.</TE>
<TE>   Although Britten had lived openly with tenor Peter Pears for many
years, his homosexuality was treated as an open secret in music
circles. It certainly was not considered a suitable topic for
scholarly inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   "No one could talk about this," recalled UCLA musicologist Susan
McClary, who, at the time, was trying to break new ground in feminist
music criticism. "In the '70s, Philip started raising these issues,
to the ire of the English. They were appalled."</TE>
<TE>   Brett's critics, according to McClary, "said, 'OK, maybe Britten
is gay, but that can't have anything to do with his music.' Philip
insisted it did. The stories Britten picked out and the way he
delineated characters had to do with his conceptions of sexuality."</TE>
<TE>   Brett's paper on Britten was rejected by a prominent journal,
whose editor dismissed the piece as a personality study. It was
finally published in 1977 by London's Musical Times. The only editing
change was to put "gay" in quotes -- "on the grounds," Brett later
told an interviewer, "that not all the readers would know the use of
the word."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years ago, his insistence on the importance of sexuality in
understanding music caused some of Brett's oldest friends to
repudiate him. But he maintained his position and grew in stature,
producing dozens of papers and several books on the topic.</TE>
<TE>   Today, "Peter Grimes" is widely viewed as an allegory of the
homosexual as outsider. In another sign of the sea change in
musicology, young scholars eagerly debate the effects of sexual
identity on the works of such musical geniuses as Schubert and
Handel. And the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, the
reigning encyclopedia of classical music in the English language, now
has a lengthy entry on gay and lesbian music, co-written by Brett.</TE>
<TE>   "The closeting of Schubert is of a similar order as the papering
over of Wagner's anti-Semitism," Brett wrote in an essay for
"Queering the Pitch, the New Gay and Lesbian Musicology," a 1994
volume he co-edited with Elizabeth Wood and Gary C. Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Brett also helped found the Gay and Lesbian Study Group of the
American Musicological Society, which in 1996 established an annual
award in his name to honor exceptional musicological work in the
field of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and transsexual studies.</TE>
<TE>   Brett spent 25 years at Berkeley before accepting an appointment
at UC Riverside in 1991. Over the next decade, he was chairman of
Riverside's music department and served as dean of humanities, arts
and social sciences. Last year, he accepted a position at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   While there, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship to complete a
book on Britten's operas, which remains unfinished. He was considered
the world's foremost authority on Britten, about whom he wrote a
highly praised, 26-page essay for the 2001 edition of the New Grove
dictionary.</TE>
<TE>   He also was known for his work on 16th century composer William
Byrd. Brett was general editor of "The Byrd Edition," a 20-volume
collection of the composer's music, and personally edited 10 of the
volumes.</TE>
<TE>   A gifted performer, Brett played the harpsichord and a small
Renaissance organ. Principally a choral conductor, he won a Noah
Greenberg Award in 1980 for his productions of Monteverdi's "Orfeo"
and Jacopo Peri's "Eurydice" and a Grammy nomination in 1991 for a
recording of Handel's "Susanna" with the UC Berkeley Chamber Chorus
and the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his longtime partner, UC Riverside professor
George Haggerty.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial contributions may be sent to the Philip Brett Award in
Lesbian and Gay Musicology, c/o American Musicological Society, 201
S. 34th St., Philadelphia, PA 19104-6313.</TE>

<HD>Sister Helen Carmody, 95; Chronicled History of Hospital
and L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Rourke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sister Helen Carmody, who founded an archive at St. Vincent Medical
Center in Los Angeles chronicling 146 years of the hospital's and
city's history, died Wednesday of complications from a stroke. She
was 95.</LD>
<LD>   She was born in Mount Hope, Wis., and in 1945 entered the
Daughters of Charity, an order of nuns long associated with a
large-winged headpiece worn by the Parisian women who formed the
original community in 1633.</LD>
<LD>   When the order changed its uniform to a navy blue dress and
optional veil in 1954, Carmody saved her habit and later donated it
to the archive as part of the hospital's history. The Daughters of
Charity founded the medical center in 1856.</LD>
<TE>   Carmody joined St. Vincent's staff as a dietitian in 1958 and
spent most of her career as the director of food services. In 1995,
during a renovation of the building, she noticed workers filling a
trash bin with outdated medical records and photographs. She quickly
put a stop to it.</TE>
<TE>   "Sister Helen always squirreled things away," said Leona Proche,
who worked as the nun's assistant for years.</TE>
<TE>   That attitude helped salvage historical data about the city's
oldest hospital, as well as the neighborhoods around it. Descriptions
of the original building, a dirt-floor adobe near Olvera Street, and
facts related to epidemics of smallpox in 1886 and typhoid fever in
1905 were included in the records. So were occasional references to
the city's population. There were 3,000 residents of L.A. in 1856,
according to the nuns' ledgers.</TE>
<TE>   After the archive and a museum were established and officially
named the Historical Conservancy program, Carmody continued to find
items for the collection, among them a silver coffee carafe and linen
napkins the nuns placed on patients' food trays in the early 1900s.
"Things like this tell you something of the era they're from," she
once said.</TE>
<TE>   "When Sister Helen started the archive, saving Los Angeles history
was a relatively new concept," said Catherine Waymost of the
conservancy program. Tommie McCrae, who worked with Carmody in the
hospital kitchen for 13 years, said she approached food services the
same way she did the archive project. "No matter what we did, she
wanted it perfect," he said. But, he added, "she was always gentle
and kind."</TE>
<TE>   Until she retired about 15 years ago, Carmody oversaw meals served
at the hospital for patients, staff and the nuns. In recent years,
the number was more than 1,000 meals each day. "Every morning at 5
o'clock, she'd come in and say, 'Do you have the coffee ready yet?' "
McCrae recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Carmody is survived by nieces, nephews and cousins.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral Mass will be said at 6:30 p.m. Monday at St. Vincent
Church, 621 W. Adams Blvd., Los Angeles. Donations may be made to St.
Vincent Meals on Wheels, 2131 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles, CA 90057.</TE>

<LD>Geraldina, 87, the queen of Albania until fascist Italy invaded the
country at the beginning of World War II, died Tuesday in Tirana,
Albania, after suffering four heart attacks earlier in the day.</LD>
<LD>   Geraldina, who lived in exile since the royal family fled Albania
in 1939, had been living in South Africa but returned to Albania in
June after 40 members of Parliament invited the family back.
Throughout her years of exile, Geraldina maintained that her only
son, Leka, was Albania's legitimate ruler.</LD>
<LD>   Born into a noble Hungarian family as Geraldina Aponi in 1915, she
married King Zog in 1938. Ahmet Zogu, a Muslim chieftain, had created
Albania's monarchy in 1928 when he declared himself king. He died in
1961 in Paris.</LD>
<TE>   Albania's monarchy was abolished by the country's communist rulers
in 1946. The former queen's son has said he will not get involved in
Albanian politics unless the population votes to reinstate the
monarchy.</TE>

<LD>Fred Scolari, 80, a two-time NBA All-Star who also coached the
Baltimore Bullets during the 1951-52 season, died Oct. 17 in a San
Ramon, Calif., hospital of injuries suffered in a fall down the
stairs of his home in Danville.</LD>
<LD>   Scolari, who played guard, joined the Basketball Assn. of
America's Washington Capitols, coached by Red Auerbach, in 1946. He
also played for Baltimore, Syracuse, Fort Wayne and the Boston
Celtics.</LD>
<LD>   A San Francisco native whose physique earned him the nickname "Fat
Freddy," Scolari used a from-the-hip shot and an aggressive defense
that helped him make the All-Star team and earned him all-pro status
twice.</LD>
<TE>   After leaving the NBA in 1955, he sold insurance briefly, then
became executive director of the Salesian Boys and Girls Club for 31
years.</TE>

<HD>Nikolai Rukavishnikov, 70; Survived Tight Spots During 2
Space Missions</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nikolai Rukavishnikov, 70, a cosmonaut whose voyages into space for
the Soviet Union encountered hair-raising problems, died Oct. 19 in
Moscow of a heart attack, Russian media reported.</LD>
<LD>   Rukavishnikov joined the Soviet cosmonaut program in 1967 and was
a member of the Communist Party.</LD>
<LD>   His first space voyage was in 1971 aboard the Soyuz 10, which was
to have delivered the first people to the orbiting Salyut-1 space
station. The craft docked with the space station, but the crew was
unable to gain access, reportedly because of a faulty hatch, and the
mission was aborted, lasting less than two days.</LD>
<TE>   In 1974, he made his next flight aboard the Soyuz 16, staying in
space for nearly six days on a mission that was part of the
U.S.-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.</TE>
<TE>   His last mission was Soyuz 33 in 1979, which turned into a
white-knuckle drama. The craft was to dock with the Salyut-6 station,
but an engine failure left it unable to maneuver. The same engine was
to have sent the spacecraft back to Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Rukavishnikov was able to fire up a backup engine, which didn't
work properly but was sufficient to return him and Bulgarian comrade
Georgi Ivanov to Earth.</TE>

<HD>A Victory for Putin, If Toll Stays Put</HD>
<DH>The number of hostage deaths is low enough in comparison
with survivors that officials can portray the rescue operation as a
success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MOSCOW -- The operation by Russian commandos to free 750 hostages in
a Moscow theater raised a cynical question: How many hostage deaths
would Russians accept?</LD>
<LD>   The question is crucial to the public's response to President
Vladimir V. Putin's handling of the hostage crisis -- and to its
support for or opposition to his military campaign in Chechnya.</LD>
<LD>   Ninety hostage deaths would be a tragedy in any country. But
although 90 dead might automatically provoke a huge political
backlash in some countries, particularly if many of those deaths were
caused by lethal fumes, the authorities here can portray that number
as a victory. That's especially true in a situation where the Kremlin
is maintaining a tight rein on the nation's major television
stations.</LD>
<TE>   "Ninety is more or less acceptable. If it goes up to 200, it will
be a different story," Andrei A. Piontkovsky, a political analyst at
the Moscow think tank the Independent Institute for Strategic
Studies, said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Liliya F. Shevtsova, an analyst with the Carnegie Moscow Center,
was sure that the casualties would have been lower if Putin had
compromised with the Chechen rebels who took the theater audience
hostage and if he had opened peace talks on Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   But Shevtsova said she believed that many Russians supported the
storming because it averted an even greater number of deaths.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, after the crisis broke, Interfax journalist Olga
Chernyak, who was among the hostages, was widely shown on television
as saying that had the building not been stormed, all the captives
would have died.</TE>
<TE>   "Now President Putin is in the situation of a winner. In the eyes
of many Russians, he won. It's a victory. Wait for the Monday
newspapers and see how many pundits are calling this a victory,"
Shevtsova said.</TE>
<TE>   Doubts about Putin's tough policy in Chechnya were most marked
during the three-day siege.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 700 ordinary people trapped and helpless in the
heart of Moscow, Russians were for the first time questioning the
sense of Putin's tough military operation against separatist Chechen
rebels.</TE>
<TE>   The siege exposed Putin's biggest blind spot, the issue on which
he is most sensitive. He took power as president in 2000 after
mounting a brutal but initially popular campaign to crush Chechen
rebel resistance, and he has not shifted his policy since.</TE>
<TE>   That campaign has been repeatedly criticized by Russian and
international human rights groups because of abuses by Russian
forces. One of the groups' main concerns has been the arrest and
disappearance of hundreds of Chechen men.</TE>
<TE>   But because of its proximity to Muscovites, the hostage siege
struck home in a way that other recent Chechen attacks have not. In
August, Chechen rebels shot down a giant Russian helicopter, killing
119 servicemen, and on May 9, terrorists bombed a Victory Day parade
in Kaspiysk, in southern Russia, killing 44 people, including many
children. Neither attack dented Putin's popularity or raised serious
doubts about his ironfisted Chechen policy.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Putin did avoid a mistake he made in August 2000, when
he was castigated for remaining on vacation as the Kursk submarine
tragedy unfolded. Instead, he took pains to appear in control of the
crisis and canceled a trip to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum in Mexico, where he was to meet with President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after the siege ended, he put on a white hospital coat and a
compassionate face to visit surviving hostages in the hospital, where
he joked with and encouraged them.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday evening, he wore black for a somber television address to
the nation that left no doubt that he would continue his tough line
in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the Chechen terrorists "scumbags," he asserted that the
storming of the theater had achieved the impossible, by saving
hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   "We have proven that it is impossible to bring Russia to its
knees," he declared.</TE>
<TE>   It was an emotional and powerful address, which acknowledged the
grief of bereaved families while suggesting that Putin has no
alternative but to continue his Chechen policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We were not able to save everybody. Please, forgive us," he said,
before branding the rebels "international terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   "They do not have a future -- while we do," he concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike during the 1994-96 Chechen war, when an independent Russian
television station, NTV, ran searing footage of the conflict and fed
strong antiwar sentiment, Russians are now complacent and largely
unaware of the actions of Russian troops in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   A key reason for the ignorance is Putin's moves after becoming
president to bring the broadcast media to heel and suppress criticism
of his rule.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Piontkovsky said the media had already begun to portray
the rescue operation as a triumph.</TE>
<TE>   "I have already heard this formula -- 'a brilliant success' --
many times on television from Putin supporters and politicians," he
said, predicting that the Russian public will support tougher action
in Chechnya, even if only temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, in the short term, it will be a victory for the party of
war. There will be a hawkish backlash," Piontkovsky said. "The
reaction of those in power, the president and the political class,
will be to strengthen its war policy, harden their position and
abandon the idea of negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   The crisis came after recent public polls showing 65% of Russians
supporting the idea of peace talks to resolve the Chechen conflict.
Piontkovsky suggested that in the wake of the crisis, most Russians
will embrace authorities' "pro-war hysteria" and that it will take a
year to 18 months before the majority once more support peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   Shevtsova predicted that Putin will neither soften his line nor
seek a peaceful settlement in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "Most probably, on the basis of his behavior over the three days
[of the siege], I would say he will continue the same policy in
Chechnya," she said. "His psychology of power and philosophy of rule
will be the same."</TE>
<TE>   She said that Putin's popularity might take a short-term hit
because of the hostage crisis but that, if so, it will probably
recover after a month or two. "People have short memories. It's
possible that, after a while, people will come to the conclusion that
Putin behaved in a correct manner and did the only thing that was
possible," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if Putin fails to alter his policy and look for a peaceful
settlement, the conflict will continue with desperation in Chechnya
and misery on both sides, according to Shevtsova. The result, she
said, will be more terrorist acts in Russia proper.</TE>
<TE>   "You will have the same lost generations of 20-year-old Chechens
seeking vengeance on Russia," she said.</TE>

<HD>Brazil Embraces Old Radical With a New Image</HD>
<DH>A landslide victory is expected for an ex-revolutionary of
humble roots who now appears willing to work with the establishment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hector Tobar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OURO PRETO, Brazil</DL>
<LD>In this city, where a group of men rose up in the 18th century
against Portuguese rule, about three-quarters of the electorate is
expected to vote today to make an old radical Brazil's next
president.</LD>
<LD>   To some, the reason is obvious: "Ouro Preto has always embraced
rebels," said Jaime Antonio Sardi, a campaign worker for the leftist
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known universally in Brazil as Lula. "It's
in our blood."</LD>
<LD>   But talk to Lula voters in this city in the state of Minas Gerais
-- in recent times a bastion of conservatism -- and the real factors
behind Lula's expected landslide victory here and in the rest of
Brazil become clear.</LD>
<TE>   Lula has managed to convince most Brazilians that he is no longer
a revolutionary who will plunge the country into the kind of class
warfare that his detractors have long predicted. Instead, they see
the former trade unionist as a level-headed administrator, a man of
humble roots who can hold his own with the nation's elite.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a guy with no formal education," said Ledio Lopes, owner
of a successful craft store catering to tourists next to one of Ouro
Preto's many Baroque churches. "Now he meets with business leaders,
he sits with 200 journalists from all over the world and answers all
their questions.</TE>
<TE>   "To get as far as Lula has, you have to be a smart guy," Lopes
added. "You watch him and you get the feeling he could administer the
country."</TE>
<TE>   Lula's new image has been cultivated by the Workers' Party
campaign in its fourth run for the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, the Workers' Party would have all these militants with
red flags working on street campaigns, and sometimes they would
create a mess," said Fabio Faversani, a historian at the Federal
University of Ouro Preto, recalling Lula's three previous runs for
the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "All that conflict scared voters away because deep down people see
in government the force that should guarantee public order,"
Faversani said. "In this election, the Workers' Party seems more
methodical. They've lost that stigma of the past."</TE>
<TE>   In effect, the Workers' Party has taken the enthusiasm and fervor
of its first presidential campaign -- a 1989 crusade for social
justice that followed almost two decades of dictatorship -- and
wrapped it in a sophisticated new media package.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Brazilian television viewers have been bombarded with
happy jingles and upbeat commercials in which Lula delivers earnest
but vague statements about issues such as poverty and education.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in tailored suits, the new Lula hardly ever thrusts his
fist in the air like the Lula of old.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he appears again and again in the commercials surrounded
by advisors, who are also in suits. The message is clear: Lula is now
willing to work with the establishment.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a good team around him, competent people who have helped
him prepare his program," said Eleonice Lopes, a language teacher and
Ledio Lopes' sister. "At the same time, he has all this experience
from his life. He comes from a humble family that had to migrate to
Sao Paulo [Brazil's industrial center] to work. He knows what poverty
is."</TE>
<TE>   If they vote Lula into power, millions of Brazilians may be
helping to write the final chapter of a story that mimics those
repeated in Latin American soap operas: A poor, ridiculed outsider,
through luck and perseverance, joins the circles of the rich and
powerful.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't expect Lula to wave a magic wand and get rid of all our
problems," Eleonice Lopes said. "But we know he won't forget us and
will try to make things better."</TE>
<TE>   Adriano Sergio da Gama, a pollster for Estado de Minas, a daily
newspaper in Belo Horizonte, the state's largest city, says Lula has
managed to dramatically change popular notions about who can and who
can't be president.</TE>
<TE>   "Working people in Brazil have always thought of Lula as one of
them," Da Gama said. "In the past, that was a bad thing, because
people thought that in order to have the job of the president of the
republic, you had to be an academic."</TE>
<TE>   Altino Pinheiro, who runs a CD store here, sees Lula as honest and
capable. Pinheiro has few fears that a Workers' Party government will
bring the economic instability that many predict.</TE>
<TE>   "Lula has calmed down a lot, and he's shown himself to be a
clear-thinking guy," Pinheiro said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing this, a customer interjected that he would vote for Jose
Serra, the candidate of a center-right coalition, because he believes
a Lula presidency would probably lead to the rampant inflation of
Brazil's past.</TE>
<TE>   Pinheiro disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Brazil needs to grow; it needs jobs," he said. Lula's program,
Pinheiro said, offers the best chance to develop Brazilian industry,
a theme that the Workers' Party has made the centerpiece of its
program -- which is highly critical of the nation's trade agreements
with the United States. "We need to be more independent."</TE>
<TE>   Conceptions about Lula have changed, in no small measure, thanks
to recent gains made by the Workers' Party, which Lula helped found
in the 1970s, when he was a trade union organizer.</TE>
<TE>   Party candidates have won local elections in several large cities
and states, earning reputations as good administrators. Recently, the
party came to power in Belo Horizonte, a city of 2 million people
about 60 miles northwest of here.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the Workers' Party was in government, people could see that
the old worries didn't make any sense," Da Gama said. "The party is
running Belo Horizonte, and the world hasn't come to an end."</TE>
<TE>   Of Brazil's 26 states, Minas Gerais was one of three that gave
Lula a majority early this month in the first round of voting.
Nationwide, Lula won 46%, while Serra won 23% and beat out two
center-left candidates for a spot in the runoff.</TE>
<TE>   In Ouro Preto, Lula won 64% of the vote. Both here, and in Minas
Gerais as a whole, Lula won more than double his vote in the 1994 and
1998 elections. Analysts say Lula has reaped the benefits of making a
local conservative business leader, Jose Alencar, his running mate.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a case of the Workers' Party moving closer to the
ideas of the Brazilian people rather than the Brazilian people
embracing the [old] Workers' Party program," Da Gama said.</TE>
<TE>   The party platform has moved to the center. Although Lula has
continued to sharply criticize the "neo-liberalism" of current
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's government -- which embraced
fiscal austerity and free-market trade policies -- he has stopped
short of calling for a complete break with the past.</TE>
<TE>   Most notably, Lula has said Brazil should continue to make
payments on its massive foreign debt.</TE>
<TE>   Suelia Maria Pena, a 33-year-old owner of an Internet cafe here,
is precisely the kind of small entrepreneur one might expect to vote
for Serra. "Brazil improved a lot under Fernando Henrique," who is
barred by law from running again and who handpicked Serra to be his
successor.</TE>
<TE>   "We have economic stability now, and even the lives of poor people
improved a little," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But she doesn't trust Serra and the mostly middle-class leaders of
his Brazilian Social Democratic Party to address the country's wide
gap between rich and poor.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, voting for Lula is a risk," she said. "But voting for Serra
is a risk too."</TE>
<TE>   She worries about the country's fiscal crisis, the pressure from
foreign creditors and a recession that has left about 11 million
people out of work.</TE>
<TE>   "We need more change in this country," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I see Lula as a serious man, a person with integrity. He might
not have much schooling, but he's a fighter."</TE>

<HD>N. Korea's Neighbors, U.S. Issue Ultimatum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Japan, South Korea and the United States joined forces Saturday
against North Korea's nuclear ambitions, laying down an ultimatum to
Pyongyang to abandon its uranium enrichment program. But they left
open the possibility of engagement and assistance in the future.</LD>
<LD>   At a three-way meeting in this Baja beach resort, President Bush
and the leaders of Japan and South Korea denounced North Korea's
recently acknowledged development of weapons-grade uranium and
demanded that the impoverished totalitarian state "dismantle this
program in a prompt and verifiable manner."</LD>
<LD>   But they also said Japan and South Korea would not go further and
cancel upcoming talks with North Korean officials, and the United
States hinted that it may be willing to engage the North in the
future.</LD>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the joint policy is
designed to be firm but patient, recognizing that harsher measures
might backfire.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure that we move deliberately, we move with
patience, that we do not create a crisis in the region," Powell told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, there would be no quid pro quo.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't violate an agreement and then show up and say, 'We
violated this agreement. What will you pay us for this violation in
order to get out of the violation?' " Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Japan has been holding talks with North Korea on normalizing
relations, with the next session scheduled this week in Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   In their statement, the leaders said those meetings would go
forward because they "can serve as important channels" to pressure
North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Bush met with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and Japanese
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi during a summit here of leaders from
the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.</TE>
<TE>   The two-day gathering, held annually to promote free trade and
economic cooperation in the Pacific Rim, has been overshadowed by
threats of terrorism and nuclear conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also lobbied Pacific leaders -- in particular Mexican
President and APEC host Vicente Fox -- to support a U.S.-proposed
United Nations Security Council resolution on use of force in Iraq.
Mexico, which is currently a member of the Security Council, has
indicated that it prefers milder French and Russian proposals because
they have wider support.</TE>
<TE>   "We think broad unanimity is more important for the U.S. cause
than details of the resolution," said Jorge Castaneda, the Mexican
foreign minister.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism was also the prime topic during Bush's meeting with
Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri. Bush offered condolences
over the deaths of nearly 200 people in a Bali bombing two weeks ago
and expressed understanding of the difficulties she has faced in
reining in radical groups.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Bush administration officials suggested that
they were seeking a harsher condemnation of North Korea. The goal,
according to a senior administration official, was "to isolate the
North Koreans, make them clear that this is not cost-free, get them
to think about their own future. If they want to engage with the
world, they're going to have to give up that program."</TE>
<TE>   But the diplomatic strategy that emerged from the talks acceded to
South Korean and Japanese desires for a policy balanced between
carrots and sticks.</TE>
<TE>   Experts have warned that it would be dangerous to further
antagonize North Korea, since it could decide to restart its
plutonium-based weapons program, which it agreed to freeze in 1994.
North Korea reportedly is years away from making a nuclear bomb using
enriched uranium but would need only months to make a plutonium-based
bomb.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea and Japan have argued against cutting off contact with
the North and said they will go ahead with scheduled meetings and
exchanges. A high-level North Korean economic delegation that
includes Chang Sung Taek, a brother-in-law of North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il, arrived Saturday in Seoul for a nine-day tour of South
Korean factories and high-tech facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The task, according to a senior Japanese diplomat, is "applying
continuous pressure but not cornering North Korea ... to the extent
that they might scratch back like a cornered cat."</TE>
<TE>   In that vein, the leaders' joint statement seemed to offer the
North Koreans a small carrot from the United States. In recent days,
the North Koreans have sought a nonaggression pledge from the U.S.
The statement did offer one, although it was a restatement of
previous policy.</TE>
<TE>   "President Bush reiterated his February statement in South Korea
that the United States has no intention of invading North Korea, as
well as the fact that he had been prepared to pursue a bold approach
to transforming" U.S.-North Korea relations, the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell stressed that the United States has no plans to meet with
any North Korean officials and that in all upcoming contacts by Japan
and South Korea, the issue of the enriched-uranium program will be
"uppermost."</TE>
<TE>   The joint statement appeared to resolve, at least for the time
being, a potentially awkward disagreement among the three countries
over how hard to press North Korea on nuclear issues.</TE>
<TE>   In South Korea, the nuclear crisis has been shrugged off in some
quarters as a creation of an overly hysterical and hawkish White
House.</TE>
<TE>   "Nuclear crisis? What Crisis?" read the headline of an editorial
Friday in the South Korean daily JoongAng Ilbo, describing the
reaction of the South's government.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a delicate difference of opinion between the United
States and South Korea about how serious this whole nuclear matter is
and whether the North is serious about developing nuclear weapons,"
said Paik Jin Hyun of Seoul National University. "Many people claim
that the North admitted the nuclear program to express their
willingness to talk to the United States."</TE>

<HD>Frustration Marks Fox, Bush Talks</HD>
<DH>While the Mexican president pushes to revive negotiations
on an immigration deal, the U.S. leader is preoccupied with Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Boudreaux</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico</DL>
<LD>After four meetings in 20 months, the once-promising courtship
between Presidents George Bush and Vicente Fox is falling into a
familiar pattern.</LD>
<LD>   Again on Saturday, the Mexican leader stressed the urgency of
easing the flow of Mexican migrants to the United States. Again, Bush
replied that he wants to deal with the issue -- "in a way that
recognizes reality and in a way that treats the Mexican citizens who
are in the United States with respect."</LD>
<LD>   "We did have a very good discussion, but I'm not surprised," Bush
told reporters afterward, with his fellow rancher-statesman seated at
his side. "After all, we're such good friends."</LD>
<TE>   But again, to the frustration of Mexican officials, Bush gave no
indication of how or when he planned to engage with Fox's biggest
diplomatic goal, an immigration deal with the U.S. And again, it was
in part because Bush was preoccupied with an enemy half a world away
-- this time, Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The 40-minute meeting here, on the sidelines of a summit of
Pacific Rim leaders, was billed by Mexican officials as a bid to
relaunch Fox's proposals. It was the first meeting in seven months
between ideological kindred spirits who took office within weeks of
each other nearly two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Fox wants Washington to expand permanent visas and guest-worker
programs for Mexicans and to give legal status to about 3.5 million
undocumented Mexican migrants who live and work in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The two countries had just pledged to negotiate those proposals
last year when the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks derailed them, shifting
Bush's focus from open borders to the need for stringent security at
home. Support for migration reform virtually disappeared in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell acknowledged the setback
Saturday but told reporters: "As we get to a more normal life and as
we bring our homeland into a firmer basis of security ... we might be
in a better position next year to deal with some of the concerns that
Americans have and Congress has had with respect to migration."</TE>
<TE>   But in the meeting, Bush balked at Fox's invitation to make a
state visit to Mexico next year. The idea, Fox said, would be to use
the 10th anniversary of the North American Free Trade Agreement to
undertake a sweeping, high-level review of U.S.-Mexican relations and
sketch out "a big vision of where we want to go."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we'll be at war," Bush replied, according to a person in
the room.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're at war, you're at war," Fox reportedly said. "But right
now you're not at war, so think about it."</TE>
<TE>   That exchange deepened a feeling among Mexican officials that
their bid for attention in Washington may be doomed by a war on Iraq.
The frustration was almost palpable Saturday as the two leaders
dispensed with their usual back-slapping. Fox made no public remark
welcoming Bush to Mexico or mentioning their friendship.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview late Saturday, Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge
Castaneda said that although Mexico does not feel rejected, "there's
a sense that there's no focus except on Iraq, and I suppose that's
understandable. But the [U.S.-Mexico] relationship is not moving
forward in the broad sense that we want it to move forward."</TE>
<TE>   Other Mexican officials say the Fox government does not intend to
wait for the White House. Soon after next month's U.S. congressional
elections, they plan to launch a lobbying effort for Fox's migration
proposals with lawmakers, religious organizations, labor unions,
business leaders, and state and local governments.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign will stress the need for cheap labor in the U.S. and
for safer and more humane conditions for the Mexicans willing to
provide it. Since 1995, at least 2,200 Mexicans have died trying to
cross illegally into the United States, and Mexican officials say the
flow has not slowed since the U.S. Border Patrol tightened its
operations after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said he told Bush that migration reform was becoming even more
urgent. Mexican farmers will be hit by competition from U.S. food
imports after Jan. 1, when the last remnants of import duties
disappear under terms of the free-trade agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico also fears that newly enacted U.S. farm subsidies will
inflict additional harm on growers here, fueling more migration.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said Saturday that talks between the two countries on
agricultural duties were making "important progress" and that there
was "complete agreement" with Bush on how to cushion the blow to the
Mexican countryside.</TE>
<TE>   But after nearly two years of such hopeful rhetoric, it's clear
that Fox has given up measuring progress by deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   "A problem so transcendent as migration merits much discussion and
the dedication of a lot of time," Fox told reporters. "Time and
circumstances have not permitted us to advance at the speed we
wanted. But we have not abandoned our interest in tackling this
issue, and we're looking for a more propitious moment to move it
forward."</TE>

<LD>SEOUL -- It was bitterly cold in his North Korean village the night
of April 8, 1997, Yu Sang Jun recalls. With no heat, he huddled under
a flimsy blanket with his 4-year-old son, Chul Yoong. It had been
days since their last meal, watery soup boiled from grass. For five
days, they had been too depleted to move.</LD>
<LD>   Early in the evening, Yu heard the child say: "Daddy, I want some
noodles." Father and son drifted back into a hazy sleep. When Yu
awoke, his son's body had grown cold.</LD>
<LD>   Close to death himself, Yu hugged his son and slipped into
unconsciousness.</LD>
<TE>   The next morning as the sun rose, Yu's older son, Chul Min, 7,
summoned neighbors. Officials of their farm cooperative in
northeastern North Korea rolled the boy's body in a futon and took it
away -- another victim of a famine that had killed one in every 10
people in their village of 800 and propelled as many as half a
million people across the border into northeastern China.</TE>
<TE>   Yu's mother had died three months earlier. His wife, weak since
the birth of their younger son in 1993, had moved in with her
parents, a five-day train ride away, where food was more plentiful --
at least for a while.</TE>
<TE>   During the famine, Yu's family subsisted primarily on what a
rabbit would eat. Some villagers also ate mice, snakes and cicadas.
Schools, which had fed lunch to the children, were closed.</TE>
<TE>   Yu rose each morning by 4 a.m., foraging in the woods for roots,
bark and leaves before scrambling to report to the farm for the
morning meeting. Farm workers listened to the proclamations of "Great
Leader" Kim Il Sung and his son, current leader Kim Jong Il, before
heading into the barren fields.</TE>
<TE>   Around sundown, Yu and the boys would eat their grass soup. They
would go to bed, Yu says, "as soon as the spoon hit the table."</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Chul Yoong's death offered his father and brother a
chance to live. Village officials gave them about a pound of tofu and
several pounds of rice mixed with cheap grains from a small stash
they kept in the school. Yu distilled some of the rice into liquor
and sold it. Hearing that there was plenty to eat across the border
in China, Yu sold the rights to his three-room house for the
equivalent of $8, bought shoes for Chul Min and some food, and they
left forever.</TE>
<TE>   Traveling in North Korea requires government permission, but Yu
sneaked aboard an old train and hid his son in a bathroom. The train
was so crowded on the 17-hour trip to the Chinese border that Yu
could hardly breathe. The train halted for about five minutes before
pulling into each station. Yu would jump out a broken window, then
get back on when he was sure the police checks were completed.</TE>
<TE>   Father and son spent a night hiding in a field near the border,
where North Korean guards passed within 100 yards of their hiding
place. Rain, fog and new spring leaves shrouded them.</TE>
<TE>   As the guards changed shifts at about 7 a.m., Yu grabbed his son
and they ran piggyback through 30 yards of icy, waist-deep water,
emerging not far from the Chinese city of Sanhecun. Peasants passed
by on ox-drawn carts but spoke only Chinese. Chul Min walked beside
his father or occasionally rode on his back, but never complained.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, they spotted a woman in traditional Korean dress, one of
the millions of ethnic Koreans living in northeastern China. She and
her husband fed them a lunch that included the luxury of pure white
rice. They gave Chul Min dry clothes. A bus driver allowed them to
get on without paying, their emaciated frames an instant giveaway.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few years, Yu herded cows, made cement, guarded
ducks and did other jobs. He dodged police and moved often. He
learned that his wife had died back in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The nomadic lifestyle wore him down, and Yu agreed to leave Chul
Min with a Korean American missionary.</TE>
<TE>   Relying on South Korean Chun Ki Won, Yu escaped to South Korea,
where he worked in a chemical plant, a steel mill and a succession of
other places, finally earning enough to pay a "broker" $4,200 to
locate Chul Min in China. When he did, he asked Chun to help return
the boy to him.</TE>
<TE>   Chun included Chul Min in a group of 19 people he brought to the
Mongolian border. There, he divided the group in half to make the
North Koreans less obvious. But one group got lost for two days in
the desert heat.</TE>
<TE>   Chul Min, 10, died of dehydration.</TE>
<TE>   Another member of the group slung the boy's body over his shoulder
and brought it to Mongolia, where sympathetic border guards buried
him.</TE>
<TE>   After winning permission from the South Korean and Mongolian
governments for Yu to travel, Chun took the boy's father to visit the
grave.</TE>
<TE>   They erected a wooden cross. Yu huddled over the grave and wept.
In keeping with Korean custom, he burned some of his son's clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Free in South Korea now, Yu is self-effacing, conscientious -- and
depressed. Other North Koreans have had it worse, he says, and it has
ruined them.</TE>
<TE>   "Many lost their humanity -- down to the very depths of their soul
because of the famine," he says. "Their hearts have been destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   In China, Yu's thoughts were of survival and escape. "I had that
hope, but now I don't have it any more," he says. "And I've lost all
my family.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm dying."</TE>

<HD>To Chaplain, Warship's Just the Place to Spread Message of
Peace and Love</HD>
<DH>Nightly rosary prayers are said below the flight deck,
accompanied by the roar of engines.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>ABOARD THE USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN, in the northern Arabian Sea -- With
his words occasionally drowned out by the launch of warplanes, Father
Matthias Rendon is leading a small group of Catholics in the nightly
praying of the rosary.</LD>
<LD>   That Rendon is aboard a ship that could become involved in a war
in the Middle East is, depending on one's viewpoint, either an irony
of history or an act of divine providence.</LD>
<LD>   For a decade, the 42-year-old Franciscan friar was a missionary in
the often war-torn Middle East. Then he enlisted in the Navy, looking
for a new opportunity to spread the Christian message of peace and
brotherhood.</LD>
<TE>   Now he's the Catholic chaplain on a ship of war that may soon be
ordered by President Bush to lead an air assault against the Iraqi
regime of Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   To those who might see a contradiction between missionary work and
military service, the quiet-spoken son of a Pennsylvania dairy farmer
says he has merely found a new way, like St. Francis of Assisi, to
become a channel of God's peace.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think of our mission as war and violence," Rendon said.
"I'm reminded of the Roman proverb: 'If you want peace, prepare for
war.' I think of us as peacekeepers."</TE>
<TE>   He enlisted two years ago after the Navy, struggling with a
chronic shortage of Catholic chaplains, sent a recruiting letter to
the Franciscan Monastery in Washington, the U.S. headquarters of the
Franciscans of the Holy Land.</TE>
<TE>   Brother Fabian, who directs the monastery, thought immediately of
Rendon, who was working at a parish in Boston and was restless for a
new challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I prayed on it," Rendon said. "I realized I was being called. And
then all the doors flew open."</TE>
<TE>   After attending chaplain school in Newport, R.I., he was assigned
in early 2001 to the Lincoln, then in its homeport, Everett, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   When the Lincoln deployed in July for a six-month stint in the
Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea, Rendon became Catholic chaplain for the
carrier and the smaller ships in the battle group.</TE>
<TE>   Rendon, whose short haircut and dark-rimmed glasses give him a
Drew Carey-ish appearance, celebrates Mass, leads nightly prayer
sessions ("I'm convinced that prayer is needed everywhere"), hears
confessions ("not as many as I would like"), and provides counseling.
He visits the other ships aboard a helicopter known among sailors as
the "Holy Helo."</TE>
<TE>   Life aboard an aircraft carrier at sea can be a difficult, even
intimidating, experience for newcomers. Not every sailor can adjust
to the tight quarters, the incessant demands of work and the lack of
privacy. Even the young, fit and highly motivated have been known to
wilt under the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   But Rendon, who holds the rank of lieutenant, says he has found
that life on a carrier is much like life in a monastery.</TE>
<TE>   "A carrier is just one big monastery when you think about it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Both worlds are highly structured. Both have a strict hierarchy of
authority. Days center on work schedules and tasks to be
accomplished. Punctuality and orderliness are mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is the communal living and working beside
colleagues with similar values and a similar uniform.</TE>
<TE>   "In a monastery or on a carrier, everybody is in the same boat,"
Rendon said. "Nobody is alone."</TE>
<TE>   Rendon attended LaSalle University in Philadelphia and, drawn to
the religious life, attended a seminary in Jerusalem. He was ordained
as a member of the Franciscans of the Holy Land, an autonomous
province of the Franciscan order that for 800 years has provided a
Catholic presence in the region.</TE>
<TE>   He spent five years in Jerusalem tending to the spiritual needs of
pilgrims, then five years at a French-speaking parish in Egypt.
Returning to America, he worked in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The Franciscans, Rendon noted, are both a contemplative order and
one committed to social activism: "We're committed to prayer, but we
are not bound by the cloisters of the monastery."</TE>
<TE>   The nightly rosary prayers are said in a small room directly
beneath the flight deck. The roar of engines and the hiss of the
steam-driven catapult are ever present.</TE>
<TE>   On one side of the room is the Navy flag, on the other a fabric
banner of a dove holding an olive branch.</TE>
<TE>   "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for our sins, now and in the hour
of our death," the group says as planes launch for surveillance and
possible bombing missions over Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Several Franciscans are among Navy chaplains serving aboard ships,
at land-based commands and with Marines. Among them is Rear Adm.
Louis Iasiello, deputy chief of Navy chaplains and former head
chaplain to the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   For Mass and nightly prayers, Rendon wears his brown Franciscan
robes, but on most days he wears his Navy uniform, with only the
cross on his collar.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy uniform is more practical and convenient," he said. "It
also makes us all equal, and that is important."</TE>
<TE>   With his dedication to order and discipline, it is not surprising
that Rendon's next goal is to be assigned to the Marines. To make the
transition, he's begun a regimen of physical conditioning, rising at
4:30 a.m. for workouts.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in a groove now," said Cmdr. Robert Marshall, head chaplain
aboard the Lincoln. "If he's going to work with Marines, he wants to
look the part."</TE>

<HD>Gas Used in Crisis Troubles Experts</HD>
<DH>Symptoms of those hospitalized in Russia seem consistent
with use of nerve agents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The decision by Russian security forces to use a powerful chemical
agent to end the confrontation with Chechen rebels in a Moscow
theater crossed a line that U.S. experts concluded years ago could
lead to disaster in such a situation.</LD>
<LD>   Although specific details about what kind of gas Russian commandos
pumped into the theater remain unknown, the extent of the casualties
and what is known about the symptoms of those who were hospitalized
appear consistent with nerve gas or a "neuroparalytic" chemical.</LD>
<LD>   But U.S. scientists have long feared that it would be impossible
to administer a dose of such chemicals that would disable people
without killing them.</LD>
<TE>   That might not matter against enemy troops in wartime, but it
could be critical in a situation such as the one in the Russian
capital.</TE>
<TE>   In the Moscow showdown, commandos freed about 700 hostages by
storming the theater after filling the building with gas that
disabled many inside. But many of the scores who died apparently were
killed by the gas, not by gunfire or explosives.</TE>
<TE>   The United States announced an end to the development of nerve gas
and other chemical weapons as part of the Chemical Weapons Convention
of 1997.</TE>
<TE>   But a government scientist who specializes in chemical and
biological weapons said Saturday that what was known about the Moscow
episode was in many ways consistent with use of a nerve agent such as
sarin, VX or soman.</TE>
<TE>   These agents could kill or hospitalize survivors, said this
expert, a physician.</TE>
<TE>   Sarin, soman, VX and related compounds belong to a family of
so-called nerve agents known as organophosphates. They cause the
muscles controlling the respiratory system, bladder and other organs
to seize up and clench.</TE>
<TE>   The agents also can reach the brain and cause seizures.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, although antidotes for these agents exist, victims can
also overdose on the antidotes, with damaging or even lethal results.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible that chemical agents containing Valium or other
tranquilizers were employed, but they would probably have had to be
used in huge quantities to prove fatal. Anesthetics are also a
possibility, but they are not always quick-acting, as the gas used in
Moscow seems to have been.</TE>
<TE>   "If there are that many people still in the hospital sick, that
sounds like a classic organophosphate nerve agent rather than Valium
or narcotics or anesthetics," the physician said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. experts stressed that analysis of what happened in Moscow
cannot be done with certainty in the absence of specific details
about what chemicals were used.</TE>
<TE>   One specialist said the Soviet Union went further than U.S.
researchers in studying and developing nerve agents and other
chemical agents.</TE>
<TE>   On a wartime battlefield, experts said, the question of dosage
would not be critical because the goal would be to destroy an enemy
force. And the United States developed and produced huge quantities
of nerve gas and other chemical agents capable of doing that.</TE>
<TE>   The situation would be quite different if such agents were used on
civilians in peacetime, where the goal would be to incapacitate but
not kill.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with organophosphates is that they are so powerful
that an overdose can be devastating, and calibrating a disabling dose
for an individual is difficult; for crowds of people in an
uncontrolled environment, the problem would be greater still.</TE>
<TE>   "It's real difficult to titrate between a lethal dose and one
that's merely incapacitating," the U.S. government scientist said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts added, however, that Russian researchers may have gone
further than their American counterparts and developed agents they
considered sufficiently safe to use, particularly in dire
circumstances such as a threat to execute hostages.</TE>
<TE>   In the human body, at the points where nerve endings meet
voluntary muscles, the nerves release a chemical called
acetylcholine, which stimulates the muscles. The acetylcholine is
then broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase so that the
muscle relaxes.</TE>
<TE>   The alternating interaction allows the lungs and other organs to
function.</TE>
<TE>   Nerve gases such as soman block acetylcholinesterase. The result
is continuous stimulation of the voluntary muscles, because there is
no chemical to break the acetylcholine down.</TE>
<TE>   If contact with nerve gas is not immediately fatal, a window of a
few hours exists in which to administer the antidote and reverse the
effects of the nerve agent. Antidotes either inhibit the release of
new acetylcholine or else knock the blocking chemical off the
acetylcholinesterase. These antidotes include Atropine and
Pralidoxime.</TE>
<TE>   "The Russians had probably a much more aggressive organophosphate
nerve agent program than we did when we had chemical weapons. We
probably stopped with VX as our most potent agent," the U.S.
government scientist said. "It's clear that the Soviets did work in
other kinds of related agents that could overcome some of the
problems of their use on the battlefield.... They had a much more
robust program in finding new organophosphates."</TE>
<TE>   "It's no surprise that the Russians have that kind of stuff," Ron
Madrid, a former Marine and an expert on nonlethal weaponry at
Pennsylvania State University, told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   "They spent 30 years putting it together. We're prevented from
doing that by treaty and executive order."</TE>

<HD>Hurricane Kenna Strikes Swift, Hard</HD>
<DH>Storm demolishes homes on Mexico's Pacific Coast. Region
declared disaster area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SAN BLAS, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Shocked residents of this Pacific Coast shrimp fishing village began
picking up the pieces of their houses Saturday after Hurricane Kenna
rammed through with 145-mph winds, shattering brick walls and ripping
off roofs.</LD>
<LD>   San Blas, a port town of 9,000, took the worst hit in the brief
but intense Friday storm, with three-fourths of its homes lost or
damaged. Kenna also mowed down wide swaths of trees as it swept
inland. Power, telephones and water were still out Saturday as people
picked through the rubble.</LD>
<LD>   "We lost it all in one minute," said Irma Gomez, 38, whose house
was flattened while she and her family took refuge in City Hall.</LD>
<TE>   Too shocked to cry, Gomez, a hotel worker, said she, her fisherman
husband and their children were left with only the clothes they were
wearing.</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Lopez, 24, sobbed when she returned Friday night from a
shelter in a town farther inland to find the concrete roof of her
family's house in huge slabs on the ground and their home ankle-deep
in water. But her two daughters were thrilled to find their puppy and
cages full of canaries unharmed inside.</TE>
<TE>   San Blas officials estimated that 80% of homes were damaged or
destroyed. Officials of surrounding Nayarit state said a woman died
when a wall fell on her. Fishing boats were toppled at their docks
and roads were damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities said communications with as many as 30 largely
Indian fishing villages in Nayarit were lost, and the government
declared the region a disaster area, eligible for emergency aid. Ten
people were injured by flying glass, an official said.</TE>
<TE>   In Puerto Vallarta, a popular beach resort about 80 miles south,
at least 42 people were hurt as the hurricane hurled objects through
the air, said regional military commander Carlos Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Luxury hotels were flooded by surges or high waves, and tourists
were stranded at Puerto Vallarta's airport, which closed temporarily
and had windows blown out. Officials had closed nearly a mile of the
beachfront to all but property owners. Even the stone arches that
symbolize the city had been blasted away.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a room facing east, so we really didn't think that much of
it until we saw 2 feet of water running through the lobby," said
Wayne Johnson, a Minnesota tourist. "We really just enjoyed lying by
the pool in the sun. But now the pool is filled with sand."</TE>
<TE>   Seawater rushed in from the bay, floating cars, stranding boats
and invading businesses. Tourists fled to higher ground.</TE>
<TE>   Blanca Becera, a spokeswoman for the city emergency department,
said at least 15 hotels, 22 restaurants, 48 clothing shops, 12 houses
and seven shopping-office complexes had been damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Kenna quickly weakened as it moved inland and Saturday was a
depression over northern Mexico.</TE>

<HD>At Least 90 Captives Die in Moscow Raid</HD>
<DH>A gas used by authorities may have caused higher rate of
fatalities, some fear. Russian officials praise theater operation,
which freed hundreds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski and David Holley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>At least 90 people held captive by Chechen militants perished in a
police rescue operation Saturday, officials said, amid disquieting
indications that a special gas used by the assault forces might have
been the main cause of a death rate of more than one out of 10
hostages.</LD>
<LD>   The Interior Ministry said the assault shortly after dawn by elite
police units and officers of the state security service killed 50
Chechen militants who had taken the audience at a theater prisoner,
vowing to blow up themselves and the 750 captives if Russian troops
did not leave their homeland.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities called the raid a success. But the death toll among
the hostages, which became public knowledge only hours later, cast a
pall on any mood of official or private celebration.</LD>
<TE>   Claims of success were "clearly an exaggeration," said Anna
Politkovskaya, a journalist for the independent newspaper Novaya
Gazeta who had tried to mediate with the hostage-takers. "Even if
only about 100 people died, as the authorities are saying, that
number is tremendous."</TE>
<TE>   "They say it is a big victory. For whom? Definitely not for me,"
said 52-year-old Yelena Molotova, distraught because she could not
find her daughter, 33, on the lists of survivors posted at various
hospitals. "I guess my daughter's life does not count for much to
those who'd call this a victory."</TE>
<TE>   President Vladimir V. Putin made a nationally televised address
that was part apology and part praise for his forces. He said the
outcome of the hostage crisis would have been far worse if police had
not acted against such a "dangerous, inhuman and cruel" enemy.</TE>
<TE>   "The lives of hundreds and hundreds of people have been saved," he
said. "We have proven that it is impossible to bring Russia to its
knees."</TE>
<TE>   "But now, I address especially the relatives of those who died, we
were not able to save everybody. Please, forgive us."</TE>
<TE>   Foreigners' Fate Unclear</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the estimated 75 foreign hostages captured alongside
the rest of the audience and cast of "Nord-Ost" was not clear,
although Russian authorities said initially that none was harmed. The
U.S. Embassy in Moscow said it had not succeeded in verifying the
condition of three American citizens and one permanent resident
believed to be among the hostages.</TE>
<TE>   In a possible indication of its sensitivity on the topic, the
government declined to identify the type of gas used in the theater
and even asserted that most of the victims died of extraneous factors
such as heart attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "You ask me if we used gas or not. Well, I am authorized to say
that special means were used," Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir
Vasilyev said. "That allowed us to neutralize the kamikaze women who
were strapped with explosives and held their fingers on the
detonators."</TE>
<TE>   Vasilyev blamed heart conditions, stress, depression, hunger and
other independent factors for the deaths. But doctors at several
hospitals, before police restricted access to their facilities, said
that almost none of the captives had wounds of any sort and that many
were being treated for gas poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   A Funny Taste</TE>
<TE>   Survivors of the raid among the hostages said the last thing they
remembered was feeling weak with a funny taste in their mouths,
apparently caused by the knockout fumes that were pumped by police
into the theater's auditorium just before the armed forces shot their
way into the building.</TE>
<TE>   "They couldn't feel it, because such gas has no smell," Lev
Fyodorov, a scientist who once worked on Soviet chemical weapons,
said on Russian television.</TE>
<TE>   An emergency worker quoted by Associated Press said that when he
entered the hall behind the commandos, he saw everyone slumped in the
seats, unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   "First we thought that they were dead. Then we checked them and
found that most were alive," Vadim Mikhailov said. "Inside there was
a sweltering heat and the odor of human excrement. People were in
shock, starved and incapacitated."</TE>
<TE>   One hostage who was conscious, Marat Abdrakhimov, described the
scene: "Soldiers around me were carrying out dozens of human bodies
and putting them on the steps of the theater. Bodies lay there in
piles and looked pretty lifeless. Then I noticed that someone was
stirring his limbs, someone was raising a head. It was as if people
were slowly coming back to their senses in the fresh, cold air."</TE>
<TE>   Politkovskaya, however, said she feared that the death toll from
gas poisoning could still rise.</TE>
<TE>   "Some hospitals have even prohibited relatives from contacting the
hostages for the next three days," she said. "This means that no one
is sure what the consequences of the use of the nerve gas will be and
how many more people will die."</TE>
<TE>   She also accused the government of using its control of the main
TV networks to hide information about the gas' effects.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear that the authorities are carefully dosing out the
information that the mass media is allowed to release," she said.
"They want to wait and see how it all turns out and how many people
will finally die."</TE>
<TE>   After the raid, troops began hauling unconscious hostages onto the
pavement, where they were piled into ambulances and taken to
hospitals to recover. A source who requested anonymity said he was
told by a doctor at the scene Saturday that it was a military-issued
chemical weapon that was used to render the people in the building
unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   No Memory</TE>
<TE>   Igor Gurevich, a saxophone player for the musical who was
interviewed Saturday in his hospital ward after the rescue, said
groggily that he could "just remember some weirdly sweet taste in my
mouth, and my head began to spin and I must have passed out."</TE>
<TE>   "I came to only here in this hospital," he said. "I don't remember
a thing after I passed out. I don't know whether it was gas or not,
but I feel pretty rotten."</TE>
<TE>   Nikolai Marchenko, 56, said his son Andrei, 32, had survived but
appeared mute at the hospital Saturday. He "can't really say a word,
just looks at me with bulging eyes," Marchenko said. "And they didn't
let me see my wife," also in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Those hostages who could speak about their suffering under their
captors' grip said that the entire time from the takeover of the
theater Wednesday night until their rescue Saturday morning had been
an ordeal of terror. They received little food, suffered the
humiliation of using the orchestra pit as a toilet and endured a
chaotic last day that ended with two people shot, and, for many,
passing out only to wake up in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Fear and Farce</TE>
<TE>   From the start, the hostage-takers were edgy, said Abdrakhimov,
32, a skinny actor from the "Nord-Ost" cast who looked haggard
Saturday as he sat nibbling food in his production company's office.</TE>
<TE>   On the first day, he said, when two doctors were allowed into the
theater, they were accused of cooperating with security forces and
the rebels fired several warning shots.</TE>
<TE>   "Then at some point, a grenade exploded on the first or second
floor and we heard this big frightening boom," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But their captors' behavior also had elements of farce.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the terrorists very quickly put on our 'Nord-Ost'
T-shirts and walked around in them," Abdrakhimov said. "Their idea of
fun."</TE>
<TE>   On the second day, the hostage-takers' commander, Movsar Barayev
-- who was later killed in the rescue operation -- ran into the hall
screaming in Chechen about President Bush and ordered that a large
bomb that had been set in the middle of the center aisle be moved to
where it could bring down the balcony to kill more people if it went
off, Abdrakhimov said.</TE>
<TE>   There were some moments that were more relaxed, Abdrakhimov said.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a portable radio with them and portable Japanese TV,
which they watched from time to time," he explained. "Those hostages
who were close then shared the televised news they caught with the
others. It was also very important to help keep us going."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the hostages were ordered to hand over all electronic
devices, including cameras, mobile phones and wristwatches,
Abdrakhimov said.</TE>
<TE>   "They put all the stuff they confiscated in one pile, and
sometimes when they wanted they would allow some of us to use it
briefly, under their control."</TE>
<TE>   Without his watch, he said, "I stopped feeling time. All of a
sudden it was nine hours later, then half a day later."</TE>
<TE>   Abdrakhimov had been captured on the stage, where for his role he
wore an airplane mechanic's jacket over a 1940s military uniform. He
was forced by the terrorists to come down into the auditorium and sit
in the fourth row with other hostages.</TE>
<TE>   "My neighbor was a stewardess, and she said that she had been
through a lot of difficult situations in her work," he said. "She
once even faced some Japanese terrorists on board, and she always
knew how to behave and what to do. But now she said to me, 'I can't
do anything but stupidly sit here and wait to be killed.' "</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Abdrakhimov said, Barayev told the hostages: "Putin
will give you up. He will order a storming operation, and we will
blow you all up."</TE>
<TE>   Severe Beating</TE>
<TE>   By Friday night, the situation in the hall began to deteriorate,
according to the account of another freed hostage, Olga Chernyak, a
correspondent for the Interfax news agency who happened to be in the
audience.</TE>
<TE>   She said that a man covered with blood somehow made it to the
theater and came into the hall. The rebels, suspicious that he was a
security agent, "started beating him up severely," Chernyak said. At
that point, one of the hostages lost control of himself, "threw a
bottle and then rushed right over the back of the seats in the
auditorium toward the exit. And he was shouting, 'Mother dear, I do
not know what to do!' "</TE>
<TE>   The militants fired at the fleeing hostage but hit another man in
the eye and a woman in the side, both Chernyak and Abdrakhimov said.
The two victims later died.</TE>
<TE>   "They did not render any first aid to the people," Chernyak said.
"Instead, they began to say, 'Everything is fine.' And the people
were shouting: 'They are bleeding to death! Save them!' "</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Chernyak said, the rebels also started to claim
that they had reached an agreement with Russian authorities, saying,
"Everything is going according to plan. And if they fail to meet our
demands, we will switch to Plan B: We will begin to execute
hostages."</TE>
<TE>   At that prospect, the Chechen women "were very happy," she said.
"They saw it as a chance to go to the next world and take everybody
else with them."</TE>
<TE>   The hostage-takers' claim that negotiations were making progress
eased the tension, Abdrakhimov said.</TE>
<TE>   "I gradually slid down on the floor from my seat, put my head on
my arms and all of a sudden fell into sleep."</TE>
<TE>   Chernyak, however, did not doze off so easily. She saw the gas.</TE>
<TE>   "It was sort of bluish-gray," she said. "There was something like
a little panic among the Chechens. They started to shoot above
themselves and around the perimeter, where they thought the storming
groups would move in from. I do not remember anything after that. I
passed out and regained consciousness only in the intensive care
ward."</TE>
<TE>   While almost all the hostages were unconscious, special forces
entered the hall. Television later showed many of the hostage-takers,
including some of the women, sitting in their seats dead, as if they
had been shot while unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   Abdrakhimov said he awoke to the sound of shooting, then "suddenly
somebody grabbed me firmly by the back of my collar and said: 'Go
out.' "</TE>
<TE>   He was still dressed in his military stage uniform, and the
security officers suspected that he was a terrorist even though he
explained he was an actor.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily I recalled my wife's telephone number, and they called
her for confirmation," he said. "Then they called our production
office and asked me to recognize the voice of one of our managers,
which I did. And only then did they let me go."</TE>

<DL>DURBAN, South Africa</DL>
<LD>On an unfinished freeway onramp that juts out of the Durban skyline
and into nowhere, people come searching for cures to an assortment of
maladies.</LD>
<LD>   Loveness Bhengu, a 22-year-old secretary, wants a special bark to
unblock her sinuses. Mashala Mkhiza needs some pineapple flowers to
make a poultice for his teenage son's swollen arm. And Lewis Mkhezi
is on a quest for the ultimate remedy: He is looking for the vendor
who claims his potion of tree bark and hyena tails will cure AIDS.</LD>
<LD>   In just a few years, the muti -- or traditional medicine -- market
on Warwick Junction has exploded into an herbal superstore, providing
tonics, hope and jobs for tens of thousands of South Africans. The
United Nations has cited the muti market as a successful example of
small vendors playing a major role in urban renewal.</LD>
<TE>   The trade in bark, leaves and other exotic flora has boomed so
much, in fact, that conservationists now fear it's threatening many
plant species across southern Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few years ago, street vending was illegal in Durban. But
city officials relaxed their rules after the unemployment rate soared
past 30%. Muti vendors popped up like mushrooms across this Indian
Ocean port city of 4 million people.</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of South Africa's black population uses traditional
medicine, according to Myles Mander, an economist with the Institute
of Natural Resources, a research group associated with the University
of Natal.</TE>
<TE>   The 100,000 traditional healers nationwide who dispense cures from
medicinal plants make muti a $200-million-a-year business, according
to Mander.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is the trade more vibrant than in KwaZulu-Natal province,
where for centuries the Zulu people have relied on herbal remedies to
soothe their colds, reduce their fevers and treat their diseases.
Even as more people have moved to urban areas, tradition and a lack
of affordable health care have sustained the muti trade.</TE>
<TE>   About 30,000 jobs are created by the muti trade in KwaZulu-Natal,
according to Mander, who has studied the business for the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization.</TE>
<TE>   "This is how I feed my children and grandchildren," said MaDlamini
Khumalo, a prominent vendor and traditional healer at the Warwick
Junction market.</TE>
<TE>   Khumalo and others insist that their herbs and concoctions are
effective. "I've been to a hospital only three times: to have
babies," she said. "This medicine is good enough for me."</TE>
<TE>   As the muti market has become more popular, more people come
seeking medicine for various ailments. A common complaint is
HIV/AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Khumalo said she simply refers clients to the hospital. But not
far from Khumalo's stall, Beaty Mkhize boasted that she has helped
many AIDS patients with her special ishongwe medicine, a concoction
of three barks.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a little something for everything," said Mkhize, pointing
to her small mounds of green plants and dried tree barks. Raising a
dried twig, she said matter-of-factly: "This could really help people
with indolence."</TE>
<TE>   Studies have shown that at least one-third of 700 plant species
traded in South Africa have some medicinal effects, according to
Geoff Nichols, a horticultural consultant with the Durban local
government. Some also boost the body's immune system, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some muti remedies for allergies and prostate cancer have even
been adapted by European and American drug companies, Mander and
others say. But Khumalo and other muti vendors are wary of Western
"bio-pirates," who they fear will steal their remedies, turn them
into pharmaceuticals and put traditional practitioners out of
business.</TE>
<TE>   While the muti boom has been good for the economy, some
conservationists are concerned about its effect on the environment.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, researchers observed that over-harvesting had led
to the disappearance, in some areas, of several plant species,
including Natal wild ginger and the pepper-bark tree, used to treat
colds and allergies. Muti dealers must now leave KwaZulu-Natal to
forage in the forests of Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Mozambique for rare
plant stocks.</TE>
<TE>   As many species become scarce, conservationists are devising ways
to conserve wild plant populations. Outlawing the indigenous medicine
trade is impractical, Mander said, because replacing it would cost
more than half of the $370-million annual health budget of
KwaZulu-Natal.</TE>
<TE>   So scientists and muti dealers have been working on other
approaches.</TE>
<TE>   Mander's colleagues at the University of Natal are compiling the
first encyclopedia of medicinal plants traded in South Africa. The
book will be used by muti dealers, conservationists and hospital
workers who often treat patients who ingest toxic plants, they say.</TE>
<TE>   A team led by Nichols has been painting the bark of some trees to
prevent plant gatherers from harvesting it. Nichols also has worked
to establish the Silverglen Medicinal Plant Nursery, a two-acre plot
on which horticulturists grow the top 20 plants traded at Durban's
muti market.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols often invites muti dealers to see how to grow their own
medicinal plants rather than harvest them from the wild. Some
traditional healers have grumbled that cultivated plants are less
potent than their cousins in the wild, he said. But many are
supporting the conservation efforts, recognizing they must protect
their livelihoods and their traditions.</TE>
<TE>   "Most realize that this is the way to go," Nichols said. "If we
don't work together, we could lose a large part of our culture."</TE>

<HD>Leading His Flock of Refugees to Asylum</HD>
<DH>A missionary helps North Koreans flee via China and
Mongolia. Risking death, the escapees brave the elements and jail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valerie Reitman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ERENHOT, China</DL>
<LD>It is their last supper together, and the shepherd has gathered his
small flock of North Koreans around a table piled with steaming
plates of shredded pork, rice and braised tofu. But the seven
refugees are too nervous to do more than nibble.</LD>
<LD>   Among them: a woman claiming to be an elite worker in North
Korea's nuclear missile program; a muscular former soldier whose
heavily scarred arms attest to a previous escape attempt; a woman who
had been sold as a bride. Urged to "be strong, be cold," she is
leaving her toddler behind.</LD>
<LD>   Their guide and pastor is Chun Ki Won, an affable South Korean who
once sold golf clubs to high-flying Japanese businessmen. Despite his
good nature and Christian heart, Chun doesn't really trust his
charges. Still, he is risking his life to help them.</LD>
<TE>   "We're at the last moment," Chun says now as they grip one
another's hands and pray. The women weep softly. "Please God, keep us
safe. Please let them be all right."</TE>
<TE>   These "chosen ones" are at one of the final stops on an
underground railroad to freedom in South Korea. Each started the
journey by slipping across the border to China, where they sought out
or stumbled upon a network of safe houses in which Christian
missionaries hid them and taught them religion before spiriting them
hundreds of miles across northeastern China.</TE>
<TE>   In just one hour, they will attempt to crawl under a 7-foot
barbed-wire fence into Mongolia. If things go well, the next time
Chun sees them will be in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   If not, they could die. Deep down, Chun is also nervous, for he
knows that danger is all around. The elements could foil them, or if
Chinese authorities capture the group and send them back to North
Korea, they could be beaten or even executed.</TE>
<TE>   On the tiny screen of his video camera, he shows them footage of
the terrain ahead: the dirt-and-sand road that parallels the fence;
the foot-high prongs meant to keep out trespassers; and their goal,
the Mongolian watchtower in the distance. They can rejoice if they
get that far, even though they'll temporarily go to jail. Chun has
bribed the Mongolians to hand the group over to South Korean Embassy
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Move quickly. Don't run," Chun instructs them in the most
reassuring voice he can muster. "There could be trucks, or guards or
dogs."</TE>
<TE>   If they are stopped, he warns, only the two who are fluent in
Chinese should speak. They are to identify themselves as shepherds
accompanying foreign scientists studying "desertification" of the
plain. They are en route to their house down the road. They are to
gripe that the researchers aren't paying them enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had to lie ever since I met you guys," Chun jokes,
acknowledging his mission's moral compromises and small payoff.
Experience has taught him that assimilation is difficult and that if
they make it to the South, these North Koreans will likely be trading
one form of misery for another: Most won't work; won't help others
escape; won't go to church or pray. They'll squander their money on
gambling and booze.</TE>
<TE>   "They always cry in front of me before they go," Chun says. "They
say, 'I'll live the rest of my life for Him.' But they always forget
it."</TE>
<TE>   They may do far worse and report him to authorities. One
missionary, Kim Dong Shik of Lynchburg, Va., has disappeared and
there is speculation that he was kidnapped by North Korean police.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know which one will betray you," Chun says.</TE>
<TE>   Defections on Rise</TE>
<TE>   War split the Korean peninsula half a century ago, dividing
millions of families. North and South are technically still at war,
and their border is the most heavily militarized in the world.
Despite its fitful expressions of interest in reform and
rapprochement, North Korea remains one of the most closed societies
on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Until a few years ago, at most a few dozen North Koreans managed
to defect to the South each year.</TE>
<TE>   But Chun and others like him have led hundreds to freedom by
taking them first in the opposite direction, into the Chinese
hinterlands. Their motivation is Christian charity as well as a
yearning to reunite the Korean peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks largely to the efforts of Chun and other activists, 583
defectors showed up in Seoul last year, nearly double the number that
arrived in 2000. At least 838 have arrived so far this year, a few at
a time.</TE>
<TE>   Chun got involved after visiting China in August 1999, when he saw
a North Korean woman being sold as a bride to a Chinese man while her
husband stood helpless. He also met a young girl who woke up one
morning to find that her mother and sister had been sold, leaving her
to beg in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "I could not erase the sense of helplessness of that man and young
girl who saw their families sold right before their eyes," he
recalled. "It tormented me."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has helped more than 150 refugees get to Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 350 wait in his safe houses north of the winding
Tumen River, which forms the border. On one side is North Korea, a
land where famine has killed an estimated 2 million people in the
last decade. On the other is northeastern China, where markets groan
with beef, apples, bananas, green vegetables, spices and the Korean
staple, kimchi.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea comes clearly into view from some vantage points on
the Chinese side. Occasionally, a soldier can be seen sitting on the
riverbank. Along one bend, a huge portrait of Kim Il Sung stares down
from a bucolic railroad station. Bald mountains, stripped of trees
for firewood, expose their bulging ribs.</TE>
<TE>   The North Korean town of Namyang, seen through a pay-per-view
telescope, seems eerily unpopulated; its low-slung buildings appear
to be mostly empty.</TE>
<TE>   Refugees say daily existence there is filled with horrors. They
report that they subsisted on roots and leaves boiled into putrid
soups; witnessed authorities shooting people who stole corn from the
fields; saw loved ones starve to death and buried them in old rice
sacks on mountain slopes packed with bodies.</TE>
<TE>   In order to get out, North Koreans might use a watch, trinket or
the equivalent of a few dollars to bribe the bedraggled guards
sitting sentry every few hundred feet. Or they might evade the guards
and then wade or swim to the sparsely guarded Chinese side. In
winter, they can trot across the river's icy bends.</TE>
<TE>   Once in China, poor and malnourished children have prowled the
open-air market in Tumen to beg for food. Adults sought out work on
farms or in factories. Some have been desperate enough to storm into
diplomatic missions in a bid to gain sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Their presence has become increasingly uncomfortable for
authorities, and China has been cracking down. China considers the
North Koreans economic, rather than political, refugees--people who,
like millions around the world, simply seek a better life elsewhere.
It has a treaty with North Korea, traditionally an ally, to return
the refugees. North Korean soldiers also have crossed the porous
border to round them up.</TE>
<TE>   Although refugees can blend in physically because the area is
heavily ethnic Korean, those who can't speak at least rudimentary
Mandarin rarely venture outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   The underground railroad is one of the few ways out of this
predicament. Refugees know that it is largely run by Christian
missionaries. Even though it is an alien concept for people brought
up in an atheist society, they know that it improves their odds if
they are religious -- or at least pretend to be.</TE>
<TE>   They also learn that the South Korean government provides each
defector a relocation bonus of about $28,000, housing, and job
training -- an astounding package for people who have earned at most
a few hundred dollars their entire lives.</TE>
<TE>   Missionary's Motivation</TE>
<TE>   Divorced with two children in their early 20s, Chun, 46, has an
easy laugh and a quick wit that he uses to put edgy refugees at ease.
He worked his way up from waiting tables to managing a hotel in
Seoul, which he did for 17 years. Flush with success, he launched
ventures that boomed and failed, including a golf equipment business
in Tokyo and a Japanese-style restaurant in Seoul. The failed
ventures saddled him with $200,000 in debt. He sold his home and
furnishings and sent his children to live with friends.</TE>
<TE>   For months, he subsisted on noodles and scraped together subway
fare. He contemplated suicide and kept a bottle of pills handy. He
gradually came to view the tough times as a sign from God that he
wasn't meant to be a capitalist. He is studying now to be a
Presbyterian minister.</TE>
<TE>   Drawn to helping North Koreans and the idea of unifying the two
Koreas, he established a mission he named Durihana, meaning "two
become one." It survived on donations from about 600 subscribers.
Providence seems to smile on him just when he is most desperate, Chun
says. Once when he had run out of money, one of the largest churches
in Seoul, Durae Presbyterian, gave him $10,000 to help the North
Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   Chun's mission pays for safe houses in China. For food. For train
tickets to the border. And for Korean-language Bibles. He takes most
of the refugees through Mongolia, but has routes through the jungles
of Vietnam and on to sympathetic, non-Communist countries such as
Thailand and Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   Maps of the escape routes decorate the walls of the modest
apartment four flights above a restaurant that serves as both Chun's
home and Durihana's offices.</TE>
<TE>   Before heading to China to pick up a group of refugees, he quietly
lays the groundwork with the South Korean government. The underground
railroad is so sensitive that top South Korean officials say little
about it on the record. It is not clear how they feel about Chun.
However, Chun says five government agents regularly tail him in
Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, Chun knows authorities will want to debrief the
woman who works in the missile factory. The higher the Communist
party rank in North Korea, the more thrilled the government is.</TE>
<TE>   Once in Seoul, North Koreans are interrogated to determine whether
they are who they say they are. Because the northerners have no
passports, birth certificates or other documents, the South Koreans
are always on the lookout for spies, or for Chinese pretending to be
North Koreans to get the resettlement bounty. Then it's off to a
residential camp where they learn how to shop, use the subway and
Internet, and drive.Chun sets out from home early on a Saturday
morning on this trip, leaving behind his girlfriend and his two
beloved dogs--a schnauzer and a poodle--named Duri and Hana.</TE>
<TE>   Flight to China</TE>
<TE>   Aboard a direct flight from Seoul to Changchun in northeastern
China, Chun fiddles with his newest gadget, a hand-held global
positioning device. It will come in handy in the Chinese hinterlands.</TE>
<TE>   He is met at the dingy airport by a Korean Chinese missionary
whose cell phone rings to the tune of "Amazing Grace." In a beat-up
truck, they head to nearby Jilin and a safe house located in a
cluster of drab buildings. The local missionary helps Chun with the
three suitcases, a box and a knapsack filled with donated clothing.</TE>
<TE>   At this first stop, Chun will minister to refugees' souls and try
to soothe their anxiety; he won't include any of them on this trip.
He realizes that he controls their fate, and it weighs on him
heavily. All the same, he has no formula for choosing who will go,
and when. The decision is part practical, part political, part gut.</TE>
<TE>   If he brings too many on one trip, they are more likely to be
caught and the South Korean government might balk at accepting them.
Those with relatives already in the South get preference. He
considers the mix as well: whether children should go, and with whom;
who is in the most danger; who will do well in the South and who has
become a committed Christian.</TE>
<TE>   Chun and the local missionary climb several filthy flights of
stairs and slip into a sparsely furnished apartment. Two bare bulbs
light a tidy room. The smell of simmering rice wafts in from the
kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Ten North Koreans are sprawled on green-foam tiles that might be
found in an American playroom. Futon mattresses lie on the side of
the room. A few Korean-language Bibles are strewn about.</TE>
<TE>   Each day, the refugees rise at 5 a.m. to worship and read the
Bible. There is little else to do, and the refugees take the stress
out on each other. They fight. Fighting is one reason so many get
caught; it draws the attention of neighbors, who alert the police.</TE>
<TE>   Chun knows that some of them might be convicts or North Korean
double agents. Once, a woman tried to use him as a drug-runner.</TE>
<TE>   Chun still vacillates between sympathy and anger.</TE>
<TE>   "They are just people at the end of their rope," he says, adding
in jest, "If I wasn't religious, I'd kill them."</TE>
<TE>   Just now, the group seems quite civilized--and savvy. But they are
auditioning for a future trip. They cluster around as Chun preaches,
telling the group that faith is not just about praying or reciting
the Bible. "It's about how you deal with people.... If you fight with
others, you're attacking God."</TE>
<TE>   "Being wealthy is not what makes you happy," he continues. "When
you get to South Korea, you'll have money and housing. But the South
Korean guy who doesn't have that, has friends and family. Is that
fair?"</TE>
<TE>   "If they study one hour, you have to study 10 hours. When they
walk, you have to run. In South Korea, you can't catch up because
you're not in a fair game. You start complaining, and that's the
problem. North Koreans are taught to be lazy. From the time you're
born, everything is free."</TE>
<TE>   Visiting Safe Houses</TE>
<TE>   This time, Chun's entire group will be from another area, around
Yanji, at the eastern end of the Chinese-North Korean border. Many of
the elderly Korean Chinese citizens here arrived when the Korean
peninsula and adjacent area were under Japanese occupation from 1910
to 1945. Hence, some of those who come across the border from North
Korea have distant relatives to help them.</TE>
<TE>   In the next two days, Chun will shuttle among five safe houses,
preaching, reassuring and making his choices.</TE>
<TE>   He stops by one tidy apartment where a woman cares for four North
Korean children. They look healthy and well-adjusted--but very small
for their ages. For many, it is as if they stopped growing precisely
when the famine started in their home country in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   A 6-year-old boy who looks like he's 3 cuddles up in a foreigner's
lap. He says he wants to be a minister when he grows up. He was left
in a church by his uncle about 18 months earlier, so malnourished he
could barely walk. A girl, now 13, was found begging in the market.
Two boys who are 10 and 11 but look 6 or 7 were told by their parents
that they'd return for them.</TE>
<TE>   The woman tries to pass the younger children off as her own. She
has enrolled them in school, and they have rapidly picked up Chinese.
Nevertheless, she's not sure how long she can continue the ruse
because Chinese couples are supposed to have only one child.</TE>
<TE>   At another apartment lives an 11-year-old girl who hasn't been
outside the building in three years. Chun fears that nosy neighbors
would realize she's not in school and doesn't speak Chinese. She came
across the river with her mother. An elder sister disappeared in the
train station when they arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to get you to South Korea," Chun tells the girl as she
draws in a notepad he's given her. "I know you'll be a good student."
He asks the girl's mother to hold out for a little while longer.</TE>
<TE>   After making his rounds, Chun hastily settles on a list of five,
and makes calls on his cell phone to the safe houses where they are
staying. At the last minute, he decides to add a young couple,
bringing the total to seven.</TE>
<TE>   The Seven Chosen</TE>
<TE>   Late on a Monday afternoon, the group assembles in the apartment
of a missionary-businessman in Yanji.</TE>
<TE>   There is Chun's trophy, the 32-year-old woman who claims to have
headed a small unit in a North Korean nuclear missile plant. Tiny,
with glasses and eyebrows that look as though they were tattooed on,
she was an elite cadre in the North Korean Communist party, went to
college, learned how to use guns and grenades, and every year
reported for reserve duty. Or so she says.</TE>
<TE>   She grew disillusioned when her sister couldn't get treatment for
tuberculosis and malnutrition. She crossed the river to China, where
a church helped her get medicine for her sister. But North Korean
authorities caught her bringing it back. Police questions about
church and karaoke -- "enjoying life," as she puts it -- made her
start thinking about how North Korea controls its people.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't laugh when you want to laugh or cry when you want to
cry," she says, dabbing at tears. "I could never think of the meaning
of life, or religion, because I always had to think of the party."</TE>
<TE>   She picks at a callus on her hand, developed in 2 1/2 years of
farm labor in China. Her saving grace is that she's learned to speak
Chinese reasonably well, which will help on this journey.</TE>
<TE>   Also chosen is a small 35-year-old man with dark curly hair, who
is clad in a black jacket. He left North Korea three years ago after
his older brother and nephew died of hunger. He worked on a Chinese
farm, was captured and spent 14 months in a North Korean labor camp,
escaped to China again and has lived for a year in a safe house.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't deny God, and so I was treated like a political
criminal in North Korea," he says. "I want to live for God. I want
freedom."</TE>
<TE>   The muscular build of another 39-year-old defector attests to his
10 years in the North Korean army, where he says he was on a special
forces team along the South Korean border.</TE>
<TE>   With his family starving, he headed to China and worked on a farm
for two years. But when he got home, he found that his wife and
daughter also had fled. He returned to China to try to find them but
was caught and sent back to North Korea. He escaped by breaking a
window on the train back to his hometown: His forearms still bear the
scars.</TE>
<TE>   He says he beat up three policemen when he escaped, so he is not
afraid of the authorities. But he is wary of the others in the group,
and he asks a reporter about his prospects in South Korea. "Are North
Korean refugees doing well in South Korea?" he asks. "Can people have
the jobs they want to have? I can do any kind of work."</TE>
<TE>   A 24-year-old woman with long brown hair was lured to China by the
promises of an illicit job broker. Instead, he sold her for $400 as a
bride to an ailing Chinese farmer, who took her to his remote village
to work on the farm. After she gave birth to the son the family
wanted, they began to abuse her.</TE>
<TE>   An acquaintance in the village helped her run away, urging her to
leave her 2-year-old behind. "Be strong, be cold," the acquaintance
said. In Yanji, she met an accomplice of Chun's, who pressed Chun to
take her along.</TE>
<TE>   She admits that religion baffles her.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot believe 100% in God," she says. Nevertheless, she's
concluded that South Korea and America are more prosperous than North
Korea because they are religious. "I want to see with my own eyes
what God has done to help the South Korean people," she says. She
seems almost giddy.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the young couple. The man, 25, is confident,
bordering on cocky. He has been sent back to North Korea five times
-- four from China and once while trying to escape with Chun through
Vietnam. His 20-year-old girlfriend is making her first attempt. She
is stylishly dressed and pretty. Chun teases her about her earrings,
which she says family members in Yanji gave her. Her parents, a
brother and a sister will be on a trip that leaves a week or two
later. Carrying a small knapsack, she is the only one to bring any
luggage.</TE>
<TE>   The last member of the group is particularly nervous. He was
caught once before and sent back. Chun's mission channeled $10,000
through a web of sources to free him and the cocky 25-year-old. Both
had been threatened with execution in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Journey to Mongolia</TE>
<TE>   Chun will leave the seven early in the rough four-day trip in a
green-and-yellow 1960s-era train to the Mongolian border. A trusted
Chinese Korean man will accompany them the rest of the journey and
keep in touch with Chun by cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   Chun appoints the missile-factory worker as the group leader.</TE>
<TE>   "She knows everything," he tells the group, assembled now in the
living room of a downtown Yanji safe house. "Just obey her. Don't ask
her any questions.... I told her everything, and I told only her. If
I tell everybody everything, you'll get into a fight. You can't make
it unless you pray to God."</TE>
<TE>   The woman from the missile factory and the forced bride are to sit
together and act like sisters. The couple will stick together, and
the other three men will pretend to be friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, let's pray," Chun says. The group leader weeps softly.</TE>
<TE>   As dusk falls, they slip out of the apartment two by two by three
and walk to the train station. Chun pays for their tickets, $50
apiece, for the journey in hard, turquoise seats. They dare not fly
or even travel in the train's sleeping compartment because officials
would check for identification cards.</TE>
<TE>   Around them, passengers hoist big burlap sacks onto overhead
luggage racks. Dim fluorescent tubes barely light the cars. By the
time the seven board the train, just an hour after it started its
journey, the squat toilets already reek.</TE>
<TE>   As the train chugs out of the station, the cityscape quickly gives
way to fields and horse-drawn carts, illuminated by a brilliant
harvest moon. Vendors hawk grilled chicken, corn on the cob and
magazines. Four of the seven shell out some of the pocket money Chun
has given them, buying several copies of the same magazines. Chun
chastises them: "Spend the money carefully. Just buy one and share
it."</TE>
<TE>   Chun uses the time after he has left the train to call on
accomplices and visit more safe houses. On his way to Hohhot, the
capital of China's Inner Mongolia province, he is asked which of the
seven will do well in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The forced bride? "She'll just be trouble," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The young couple? "They'll just give me a hard time."</TE>
<TE>   Why does he bother, then? He believes it's his Christian duty.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at their character, there's no reason to bring any of
them in," he says. "Some people say, 'Why don't you just bring in the
good ones?' But I think that's wrong. They're all God's people, and
we have to save them because otherwise they'll die.... It's my
mission."</TE>
<TE>   In Hohhot, Chun hires a taxi for the five-hour drive to the
border. On the way, a camel occasionally comes into view in the brown
fields. Sheep and goats outnumber people. Huge trucks heaped with
sacks of potatoes rumble by. He uses the daylight to videotape the
fence where the refugees will make their crossing. But the taxi gets
stuck in the sand. After several attempts to push it out, the driver
flags down one of several trucks working on what appears to be a
road-building operation.</TE>
<TE>   He makes a deal with the truck driver to carry a group of
"researchers" back to the fence that night on his flatbed. The truck
seems like a Godsend. It will take them directly to the crossing
point. A previous group had to start farther back and wandered for
two days. A 10-year-old boy died of dehydration.</TE>
<TE>   Arrival by Train</TE>
<TE>   Now in a private room of a restaurant in Erenhot, the last town
before the Mongolian border, Chun greets the refugees who have
arrived by train. He gently teases them.</TE>
<TE>   Relationships among them have clearly changed. The missile worker
has become close to -- perhaps even romantically involved with -- the
special forces man, according to the Chinese guide who accompanied
them. The former soldier was nearly arrested by police for smoking on
a railroad platform, putting himself and possibly the entire group at
risk.</TE>
<TE>   It is also clear that the group has a new de facto leader: the
young man Chun added with his girlfriend at the last minute. He seems
the most calm and confident.</TE>
<TE>   Seated at a big round table, Chun tells the group that the
Mongolians will confiscate any money and valuables they have, and
suggests that they give it all to him for safekeeping. He assures
them that he'd give it back when they get to Seoul. But no one gives
him a thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever they have is such a small amount. They can't even get a
meal in South Korea with it," he explains later. "They don't even
trust me -- they think I'm somehow doing this for my own purposes."</TE>
<TE>   Chun urges them to "eat tonight, even if you're not hungry," but
the heaping plates of food go largely untouched. They are too
nervous.</TE>
<TE>   With Chun's final advice, they grasp one another's hands tightly
and pray together one last time.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's thank God," Chun says.</TE>
<TE>   By now, the forced bride's giddiness has turned to fear.</TE>
<TE>   The cocky young man says he "won't sleep till we're on the plane
to South Korea." Chun gives him a cell phone and tells him to call as
soon as the group makes it across the border.</TE>
<TE>   As they climb onto the truck's flatbed, a fierce wind stings their
cheeks. A few snowflakes flutter down as a big full burnt-orange moon
rises, turning white as it finds its place high in the sky. The stars
littering the sky offer a dim halo of light as the truck gets closer
to the border and the Mongolian watchtower comes into view, perhaps a
mile away.</TE>
<TE>   The driver pulls up close to the fence, kills the headlights, and
the defectors quickly jump 5 feet to the ground. They dash for their
lives. It takes them no more than a minute to crawl under the fence
and disappear into the night.</TE>
<TE>   Ten minutes later, Chun's cell phone rings. In a trembling voice,
the leader describes where they are. Chun tells them to keep going,
that they've only made it across the Chinese border but are still
inside the no-man's-land between countries.</TE>
<TE>   Chun is excited too. Things are going even better than planned.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 25 minutes go by. The phone rings again. Nearly out
of breath, the leader exclaims, "We're here!"</TE>
<TE>   Epilogue</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks later, the group would be flown to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   But on a mission three months later, Chinese authorities arrested
Chun and a dozen refugees along the Mongolian border.</TE>
<TE>   Charged with smuggling, he was held for seven months before
appeals from South Korea and the United States, and the payment of a
$6,000 fine, won his freedom. Though he lived largely on bread and
water and his cell was crowded and cold, he says he was spiritually
happy in jail. "I guess the words of the Bible kept me going," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   The woman who claimed that she worked in the North Korean missile
plant really hadn't. Her husband had. She now works in a beat-up cell
phone factory in a Seoul industrial park. She thinks constantly about
the family she left behind in North Korea, especially her 6-year-old
son.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here, amid this plenty, all alone," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Other refugees who remained in China were caught because they did
not have Chinese identification cards.</TE>
<TE>   Among them were the parents and two brothers of the young leader's
girlfriend, as well as the 11-year-old girl who hadn't been outdoors
for years -- and her mother.</TE>
<TE>   Chun has also heard that some of those who were captured offered
to inform on him.</TE>
<TE>   But as soon as he got back to Seoul, he was working the phone.
Although he won't be able to return to China because of his arrest,
Chun will continue with his mission.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that I have personally experienced a bit of the hardship
they've gone through," he says, "I'll help them even more than
before."</TE>

<HD>Davis Tailors His Barrage of TV Spots</HD>
<DH>Governor has swamped Simon with $30-million ad budget,
triple his rival's spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Finnegan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Garry South grinned as he scrolled down page after page of television
shows on his computer screen: "Frasier," "Everybody Loves Raymond,"
"60 Minutes II." South, chief architect of the Gray Davis reelection
campaign, was scanning a log showing where television ads had been
run by the governor and his Republican challenger, Bill Simon Jr.</LD>
<LD>   On one day in August, it showed, a Davis spot depicting Simon as a
shady businessman had run at least 178 times.</LD>
<LD>   That same day, Simon broadcast not a single ad.</LD>
<TE>   Since June, the Democratic governor has swamped his rival with
more than $30 million in television ads, roughly triple what Simon
has spent on TV. But that is just one of the distinctions in how the
campaigns have waged their most public battle.</TE>
<TE>   Television ads are the weapon of choice in California elections,
the sole strategic imperative big and broad enough to capture the
attention of the state's 15 million registered voters.</TE>
<TE>   For Davis, that has meant targeting each of California's diverse
voting blocs with a precisely choreographed sequence of TV spots,
market-tested by a tightknit ad team with cash at its disposal.</TE>
<TE>   For Simon, it has meant scrambling, at times, for the money to buy
even a minimal presence on the air, even as two teams of ad-makers
clash over who has the candidate's permission to buy time on TV
stations.</TE>
<TE>   The sophistication of the Davis ad strategy is partly a luxury of
the governor's huge financial edge over Simon.</TE>
<TE>   From June to mid-October, Davis spots aired more than 26,000 times
in the state's five biggest media markets; Simon's ran fewer than
5,000, according to the governor's ad tracking service.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis ad budget has grown steadily to more than $3 million a
week -- roughly twice the usual weekly cost needed to gain voters'
attention. It will hit $4 million for the final week, South said.
Davis has been able to buy 30-second spots on the World Series and
top-rated prime-time shows. In Los Angeles last week, those included
NBC's "ER" ($52,250) and "Friends" ($47,500).</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who has loaned his campaign $5.25 million in recent weeks
to keep it from going broke, has put the bulk of his ads on less
expensive news shows, which are also saturated with Davis spots.
Among Simon's sparse prime-time buys in Los Angeles this month have
been 30-second spots on NBC's "Law &amp; Order" ($28,500) and CBS' "60
Minutes" ($18,000). Simon spokesmen said he, too, has run spots
during the World Series, but only outside Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Rollins, senior consultant to Simon, said his campaign was
essentially "limping" to election day. Given the Davis attack ads and
Simon's "stumbles and the missteps," donors were "not investing as
heavily as we would have hoped," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the money shortage, Simon's ad effort has also been
hampered by staff turmoil. Republican leaders in Washington were so
put off by his early TV spots that they forced him to replace media
strategist Sal Russo, according to four party sources.</TE>
<TE>   Over the summer, Russo repeatedly took Simon spots off the air
before large numbers of voters had seen them. That churn angered
Republican leaders -- and struck Davis advisors as "idiotic," as
South put it.</TE>
<TE>   "You might as well be taking cash and throwing it out the window,"
South said. "You're wasting the money."</TE>
<TE>   National GOP leaders also disliked Russo's ads on Davis'
aggressive fund-raising. The party threatened to withhold Republican
National Committee money unless Simon bounced Russo, the sources
said. So Simon hired Larry McCarthy, a Washington media consultant,
to produce the rest of the ads and buy time from TV stations.</TE>
<TE>   But the transition has been rough. Russo's Sacramento firm, which
stood to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions on
Simon's ad buys, told TV stations that it remained Simon's only ad
buyer. Rollins, Simon's senior consultant, then told the stations in
a terse letter that McCarthy's ad buyer was the only one authorized
to place the campaign's commercials.</TE>
<TE>   "Does the RNC like Larry more than me? I'm sure they do," Russo
said. "I'm not a Washington insider."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, McCarthy prevailed as the ad guru, but Russo remains a
top Simon advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Davis campaign tracks every spot Simon runs in big
broadcast markets, advisors to the GOP candidate say they try
nonetheless to keep their rival off guard. For that reason, Simon's
campaign has declined to provide details on its ad strategy.</TE>
<TE>   At times, the Simon campaign has made inaccurate public statements
about its ads. In an Aug. 21 press release, Russo said the campaign
would "remain on the air for the remainder of the election." But
Simon later pulled all of his ads -- and kept them off the air for
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the Simon teams, Davis has stuck with the same
group that propelled him to victory in 1998. The main players are
South, pollster Paul Maslin, and media consultants David Doak and Tom
O'Donnell.</TE>
<TE>   It is a team with deep faith in focus groups. Before any Davis
spot goes on the air, his advisors test it with at least two of them
-- usually one with 11 men and another with 11 women. Maslin screens
the ads and leads the discussion to gauge voter reaction.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has used focus groups for all his TV spots since 1992, when
he created an uproar by running an ad -- untested -- that likened
rival U.S. Senate candidate Dianne Feinstein to convicted tax cheat
Leona Helmsley, the New York hotel magnate. The resulting furor
nearly ruined Davis' career.</TE>
<TE>   In late May, focus groups saw the first spots savaging Simon's
resume. They confirmed what the Davis team suspected: Corporate
scandals had created a toxic political climate for rich businessmen
seeking public office for the first time -- in other words,
candidates like Simon. Focus groups watched the spots and "deserted"
Simon, South said.</TE>
<TE>   "People were not willing to give the so-called successful
businessman the benefit of the doubt," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, Davis went on the air with his first anti-Simon
ad. It blamed him for the taxpayer bailout of an S&amp;L.</TE>
<TE>   But even then, Davis took no chances. The ad ran for two weeks in
Los Angeles; only after Davis took a poll confirming that it hurt
Simon did the governor start broadcasting the ad in San Diego and San
Francisco, South said.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the campaign, Davis has varied his ads by region.</TE>
<TE>   In coastal cities where voters lean left, he has trumpeted his
support of abortion rights, gun control and the environment. Inland,
where voters tilt right, he has ignored those topics and marketed his
denial of parole to incarcerated killers and the Bronze Star he
earned in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain things are going to work better in certain places, so you
emphasize it a little more," Maslin said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis ran a spot on Simon's oil-industry ties only in Santa
Barbara, Monterey and other coastal markets where many voters oppose
offshore oil drilling.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, the media market most friendly to Democrats,
Davis has run fewer anti-Simon ads, preferring instead to polish his
image with positive spots.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the state's most expensive market for advertising,
Davis has used cable TV to reach key voting blocs. More than four in
10 California voters live in the L.A. broadcast market. Viewers are
mainly moderate or liberal, so Davis has run his coastal ads on Los
Angeles stations.</TE>
<TE>   But in outlying areas of the market -- Orange, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties -- voters tend to be more conservative. There,
Davis has used local cable systems to run the same tough-on-crime and
veterans spots that he broadcast in the Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   One reminds viewers of the governor's "duty and service" in
Vietnam before slamming Simon for not voting, refusing to release his
tax returns (he eventually did) and suing the government to recoup
his investment in the failed S&amp;L. Among the channels where Davis
placed the ad were Fox News, popular among conservatives, and ESPN,
watched mainly by male sports fans, including veterans.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to talk to people about the things they care about," said
Jim Margolis, a media consultant who used similar cable techniques
for U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer in 1998. "If you were saying different
things to different people on the same issue, then you might run into
a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's money problems have limited not only the visibility of his
ads but his flexibility in tailoring them to diverse voting blocs.
Aside from a slightly higher concentration of ads in San Diego -- to
exploit Davis' unpopularity in the region hit hardest by the
California energy crisis -- the Simon campaign has done no regional
targeting of its spots, Russo said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has also run relatively few ads in San Francisco in the
final weeks of the race. Despite pockets of conservatives and
moderates around the Bay Area, "it's an inefficient place for a
Republican to advertise in the best of circumstances," Rollins said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the summer, when Simon had few ads on broadcast television,
his campaign did run cable spots. But they were geared less to voters
than to "our donors and the chattering class -- to show them that
we're in the race, that we have something up," Rollins said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being outgunned for months, the Simon team is buoyed by
Davis' failure to boost his popularity much -- even if his attack ads
have driven Simon's poll ratings down. Davis advisors said last week
they would stick with positive ads for the rest of the campaign, but
resumed the attack spots on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's ads also remain negative. Rollins said the spots simply
remind voters "why they don't like Davis" and urge them to "take a
second look at Bill."</TE>

<HD>Campaigning Politicians Try Not to Dwell on Risks</HD>
<DH>The death of Sen. Paul Wellstone, who died in a crash that
also killed his wife, daughter and five others, is the latest in a
long line of casualties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan Garvey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The trick is not to think about it, political veterans say.</LD>
<LD>   The constant air travel, the flights on tiny planes, the trips
through lousy weather, all routine. Everyone -- candidates, their
aides and the reporters who follow them around -- has a harrowing
story to tell. But few ever refuse to travel on.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Carrick, a veteran political consultant, can vividly recall a
1988 flight over Iowa with House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt
(D-Mo.), then vying for the presidency. At 9,000 feet the battery
froze.</LD>
<TE>   "That was a little scary," Carrick said. The next day he and
Gephardt got right back on the plane.</TE>
<TE>   H.D. Palmer, communications director for California's Senate
Republican Caucus, was once high above Idaho in a four-seater with
then-Sen. James McClure (R-Idaho) when the plane door popped open.</TE>
<TE>   "There were two people strapped into one seat belt in the back,"
he said. "I put one hand on Sen. McClure's shoulder and pulled the
door shut with the other. I was a little unnerved; he barely
blinked."</TE>
<TE>   But as much as they try to put it out of their minds, the risk
sometimes overtakes American politicians and their staffs.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), who died Friday in a crash that
also killed his wife, daughter, three close aides and two pilots, was
the latest in a long line of casualties.</TE>
<TE>   En route to the funeral of a friend's father, Wellstone had been
going at a hectic pace for weeks, one that had picked up speed in
recent days as he battled to hold his seat against a strong
Republican challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "This is retail politics: getting out, meeting voters in different
parts of the state," said Lawrence Jacobs, a University of Minnesota
professor of American politics who was closely following the race.
"It is absolutely not an option to not fly. [Wellstone] had to be
everywhere at once."</TE>
<TE>   This brand of press-the-flesh campaigning has dominated American
politics since the beginning -- a style made only more demanding with
modern air travel.</TE>
<TE>   The dangers are illustrated by the names of some of the dead and
an account of near misses:</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago Mel Carnahan, the Democratic governor of Missouri,
was killed near the close of his Senate campaign in a plane piloted
by his son. In 1993, South Dakota Gov. George S. Mickelson died along
with seven others when his state-owned plane crashed in an Iowa
rainstorm. In 1991, Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) went down when his
chartered plane collided with a helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   McClure, as Palmer pointed out, was first elected to Congress in
1966 after the leading Republican candidate was killed in a fiery
crash on landing before election day.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't think about it, because you can't think about it," said
Eric Hauser, a political consultant who was Bill Bradley's press
secretary during the former New Jersey senator's presidential run in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only because your mind is so far past the safety issues,
but that your purpose is singular," Hauser said. "If there's a
problem -- maybe the plane gets grounded or something -- all you
think about is: What's the next thing to do?"</TE>
<TE>   Part of the danger lies in the frequency with which politicians
fly smaller planes and take noncommercial flights, a necessity in
many states where campaign stops are far from big airports.</TE>
<TE>   The statistics are alarming. In 2000, for example, charters logged
only about three flights for every five flown by major airlines in
the United States but accounted for 80 accidents, compared with 56
accidents involving the large carriers, according to FAA records.</TE>
<TE>   From 1996 through 1999, the accident rate for charters was 3.46
per 100,000 passengers, about 12 times that of large commercial air
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   When questions arise about a plane's safety, campaign staff
members often assure others on board that a candidate would never
intentionally be placed at risk. Still, budgets are tight in most
campaigns, making changes in travel arrangements difficult under any
but extreme circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Even White House travel can be an adventure for those relegated to
charter flights needed for the overflow from Air Force One and Two.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post reported earlier this year that one Canadian
charter company used for a European trip ran out of fuel on a
subsequent transatlantic flight and was forced to make an emergency
landing in the Azores. The captain, it turned out, had served time
for drug-running. The company, Air Transat, was banned from future
White House work.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, then a Democratic presidential
hopeful, took matters into his own hands after a charter flight so
rocky that some sobbing passengers thought the plane would break up
in midair. After kissing the ground upon landing, Jackson ordered his
staff to hire another plane. At the time, the craft's defenders said
he was overreacting. One even suggested that he would have been
better off kissing the plane. Eight months later the same craft, a
Lockheed Electra that had also been used in the campaign of Sen. John
Glenn (D-Ohio), crashed outside Reno.</TE>
<TE>   Although they know the history, those regularly on the campaign
trail say it doesn't overwhelm them.</TE>
<TE>   "You know these aren't commercial airliners with rigorous safety
checks. You aren't flying into sophisticated airports. A lot of the
time you're going into rural areas," Carrick said.</TE>
<TE>   "But you get over it. A day later you say, 'Why would anyone in
the world do that?' But I'll end up on a crop duster in Iowa in 18
months, come primary time."</TE>
<TE>   Carrick said it was not lost on him that Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), who lost a close aide and nearly died in a 1964 plane
crash, had spent Friday morning campaigning with Wellstone.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at Sen. Kennedy. He went down on an airplane, broke his
back, his aide was killed and he's out there doing it every day now,"
Carrick said. "I think you just move on."</TE>

<HD>The Angels Come Back for Game 7</HD>
<DH>When all seems lost, yet another late rally for a 6-5 win
sets the stage for the Series finale today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The baseball seemed to hang forever, drifting across the October
night, even as the crowd began to roar.</LD>
<LD>   By the time it fell to the ground, untouched, splashing against
the outfield fence, the Anaheim Angels were on their way to another
improbable victory, on their way to Game 7 of the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   For this latest miracle in a season of miracles, the Angels
trailed by five runs and appeared all but finished before scrambling
back for a 6-5 victory over the San Francisco Giants in Game 6 at
Edison Field on Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   The game-winner came from third baseman Troy Glaus, who hit a
long, looping, two-run double in the bottom of the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   "That was our goal -- to get to Game 7," Glaus said. "Now we've
given ourselves that chance and we'll see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's deciding game at Edison means one more chance for the
Angels to win a Series no one guessed they would be anywhere near.</TE>
<TE>   One more chance for Giant slugger Barry Bonds -- who hit a
towering homer but also made a crucial fielding error -- to prove he
can lead his team to a title.</TE>
<TE>   One more chance for Angel fans to savor a storybook season worthy
of the team's owner, the Walt Disney Co.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not baseball we saw, that was theater," Champ Gabler, 57,
of Victorville, said. "And that's the best stage in the whole world."</TE>
<TE>   The spotlight tonight will be on a pair of offenses that have
scored runs by the handfuls.</TE>
<TE>   It will also shine on two starting pitchers, John Lackey for the
Angels and Livan Hernandez for the Giants, who have been less than
stellar in the Series.</TE>
<TE>   The Edison Field crowd will be there to witness the drama.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the fans seemed tentative at first, subdued by the
fact their team had lost twice in a row to trail in the Series, three
games to two.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the streets of downtown San Francisco were crowded
with fans decked in orange and black, streaming into sports bars and
filling a park where they watched the game on a 20-foot television
screen.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Willie Brown, on hand to address his constituents, referred
to a wager -- something to do with headwear -- that he had made with
his Anaheim counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   "He will be wearing my fedora," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   And for much of the night, it seemed Brown would be right.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants took a 3-0 lead in the fifth inning when Shawon Dunston
hit a two-run homer and Kenny Lofton scored on a wild pitch. Bonds
followed with a homer in the next inning.</TE>
<TE>   By the bottom of the seventh, the Angels trailed 5-0 and even the
Anaheim faithful, who had witnessed their team rally for victories
dozens of times this season, were concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "I sank down in my seat a little bit," said Blaine Pollard, 27, of
Chino Hills.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels had been in this predicament before, during the
regular season and the playoffs. So often, they had put together
unexpected rallies.</TE>
<TE>   This turnaround began with Scott Spiezio's three-run homer in the
seventh and continued with Darin Erstad's solo home run in the
eighth. A few batters later, Glaus drove a pitch to deep left-center.
Ironically, it was Bonds who sprinted for the ball only to watch it
sail just beyond his reach.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best feeling in the world," said Mike Ashcraft, 27,
of Santa Ana, among a crowd that literally danced in the stands after
the final out.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second consecutive year the season has ended with a
Game 7. Last fall, the Arizona Diamondbacks scored two runs in the
bottom of the ninth inning to defeat the New York Yankees, 3-2, in a
thrilling upset.</TE>
<TE>   Now this series -- a so-called interstate battle of north versus
south that has commanded the attention of Californians, if not the
rest of the nation -- has a similar chance to make memories.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing about this club, we always come back after tough
losses," Giant Manager Dusty Baker said. "We've been doing it over
and over. It just seems like it never comes easy and we never do it
easy. We knew it was going to be a tough day today. Here we are going
to Game 7."</TE>
<TE>   If only Baker could convince the people on the San Francisco
streets, cheering most of the night, but suddenly quiet after the
Angels' comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Their team, after all, has been to the Series only twice since it
moved west from New York in 1958--and lost both times.</TE>
<TE>   "You are six outs away from something this city has never seen,"
Gary Ayers, 32, of San Bruno said. "And to see it taken away is
pretty disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   With the Series tied at three games each, Mayor Brown faces the
distinct possibility of losing his bet and wearing a cowboy hat while
the Angels and their fans are understandably optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what we all play for," Glaus said. "To be in the last
game of the World Series with a chance to win."</TE>

<HD>Huge March Protests Bush Stance on Iraq</HD>
<DH>More than 100,000 antiwar demonstrators turn out at the
White House, and thousands more dissent in San Francisco and Europe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage and Arianne Aryanpur</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More than 100,000 demonstrators marched around the White House on
Saturday to protest, peacefully but loudly, President Bush's plan to
use military force in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   They carried signs bearing slogans such as "Regime Change Begins
at Home" and "No More Blood for Oil." Another popular placard scorned
the administration's war talk as "A Weapon of Mass Distraction."
Organizers said it was the largest antiwar rally in the nation's
capital since the Vietnam War.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in the week, they had worried that the Washington-area
sniper would scare away protesters. But as the crowd swelled
throughout the afternoon under a sunny sky, they said as many as
200,000 had come.</LD>
<TE>   Worldwide, similar demonstrations drew crowds of thousands, from
San Francisco to Augusta, Maine, and in Berlin; Frankfurt, Germany;
Copenhagen and Stockholm.</TE>
<TE>   "If we launch a preemptive strike on Iraq, we lose all moral
authority," the Rev. Jesse Jackson told the huge crowd near the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial. "How will we say no to India, to Pakistan,
to China when they consider preemptive strikes? ... Saddam Hussein
should be held accountable for his crimes. That's a good argument for
the International Criminal Court, not a good argument for bombing
Baghdad."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration strongly opposes the International
Criminal Court, fearing that U.S. troops on peacekeeping missions
could be accused of war crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson began his remarks by calling for a moment of silence to
remember Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and his wife, Sheila, who
died in a plane crash Friday. Wellstone was the only Senate Democrat
in a reelection battle to vote against the resolution that authorized
the president to attack Iraq. Notably absent from the dozens of
speakers at Saturday's rally were any elected officials, with the
exception of recently defeated Rep. Cynthia A. McKinney (D-Ga.). She
lost in her party's primary.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Democrats appeared none too popular in the crowd of
antiwar liberals and old-fashioned leftists. There were signs
criticizing Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Hillary Rodham
Clinton (D-N.Y.), both of whom voted in favor of the war
authorization. But the most unpopular figure of all appeared to be
John Ashcroft, the U.S. attorney general. The mere mention of his
name prompted boos to swell from the crowd, followed by semi-obscene
chants.</TE>
<TE>   The "Axis of Evil" was featured on many placards and in several
speeches. In this crowd, the evil threesome consisted of "Bush,
Cheney and Rumsfeld." Speakers included former Atty. Gen. Ramsey
Clark, actress Susan Sarandon, singer Patti Smith and the Rev. Al
Sharpton.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush was in Mexico on Saturday attending an economic
summit. "It would have been good for you to be here, George, so you
could see what America really looks like," Sharpton told the crowd.
"We are the real America. We are the patriots that believe that
America should heal the world and not bring the world to nuclear war
over the interests of those business tycoons who put you in the White
House."</TE>
<TE>   The demonstrators in Washington arrived on buses from around the
East Coast and the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush is not telling the people the truth at all," said Katherine
Tweedale, 45, of Detroit. She had driven overnight with two friends.
"There is a nuclear presence in North Korea, and we are negotiating
there. So why can't we negotiate with Saddam? There is a double
standard in our foreign policy."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd included many college students, as well as those who
said they had protested during the Vietnam War era.</TE>
<TE>   It also attracted a significant number of Muslims. Rashid Pharoan,
a Syrian who has lived in Baltimore for six years, waved a large
Iraqi flag and donned a traditional Syrian head scarf. "All the Arabs
are our brothers," Pharoan said. "We feel they are like the Syrians."</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco rally drew an estimated 42,000 demonstrators in
front of the newly gilded City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Jinni Harrigan, a psychology professor at Cal State Fullerton,
spent the night downing cold pizza and sleeping on a bus headed for
San Francisco. "In the '60s," she said, "I was raising my daughter. I
said then that when the next war comes along, I'll march to try and
stop it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Stephanie Llewellyn, 52, of Orange County: "In the '70s, I
demonstrated against Cambodia at UCLA. I'd been asleep ever since.
It's time to wake up."</TE>
<TE>   The mostly older crowd, representing a kaleidoscope of causes,
united in opposition to war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Alexis Harper, 21, a yellow armband monitor, said that as an
environmentalist she opposed going to war against Iraq because "war
is a huge polluter and it's really unnecessary."</TE>
<TE>   When the march was over, Eve Lieberman, 93, a tiny woman in a
small wheelchair who has been an activist since the 1930s, voiced
satisfaction in the turnout.</TE>
<TE>   "So many homemade signs," she mused. "This wasn't the work of
large organizations. It was really an outburst of people's
sentiment."</TE>

<HD>School Testing Backlash Key in 5 Governors Races</HD>
<DH>Florida is top contest for Democrats who object to reform
law that grades performance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Even as the new federal education law is pushing states toward
greater emphasis on high-stakes testing of students, a backlash
against such exams is emerging in key gubernatorial races around the
country.</LD>
<LD>   In at least five of the contests, Democratic candidates are
challenging the increased use of standardized tests for purposes that
include evaluating school performance and determining whether
students will graduate high school.</LD>
<LD>   The most aggressive has been Bill McBride, the Democratic nominee
in Florida, who is pledging to scrap the testing-based system for
grading school performance that Republican Gov. Jeb Bush counts as a
key achievement.</LD>
<TE>   Democratic nominees in Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Texas also
are pledging to roll back their states' use of standardized tests.</TE>
<TE>   These challenges are emerging as the new federal education reform
law is requiring all states to annually test every student in third
through eighth grade in reading and math -- and then reward or punish
schools based primarily on their success at improving student
performance on those exams.</TE>
<TE>   Though the changes the Democratic candidates are advocating
wouldn't necessarily put their states in conflict with that law, many
experts believe these campaign critiques spotlight an unease about
testing that may result in direct challenges to federal requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "There is clearly a collision coming here," said David Plank,
director of the Education Policy Center at Michigan State University.
"Under the federal law, lots and lots of schools, including some that
would be considered very good schools, are going to be identified as
not meeting standards. And that's going to be politically untenable
for governors."</TE>
<TE>   The testing backlash remains sporadic. In Congress, most senators
and House members from both parties voted for the so-called No Child
Left Behind Act, which imposed the annual testing requirement on
states. And many centrist Democrats, such as Gov. Gray Davis, say
they still support tough testing regimes.</TE>
<TE>   But the questions some of the Democratic gubernatorial candidates
are posing this fall may signal an end to the consensus that
developed for increased testing as the centerpiece of tougher
educational accountability systems.</TE>
<TE>   These issues have been joined most directly -- and the national
implications most clearly raised -- in Florida, where education is
probably playing a larger role in the governor's race than in any
other state.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, when Bush was first elected, he promised to focus
on education. But McBride, a lawyer, centered his campaign on
denouncing Bush's education record.</TE>
<TE>   McBride's ads portray Bush's term as a failure for schools, citing
statistics that show the state ranking near the bottom of the nation
in per-student spending, SAT scores and class size. Accusing Bush of
slighting education for tax cuts, McBride is promising to spend at
least $1 billion a year more to raise teacher salaries, expand
pre-kindergarten programs, reduce class sizes and build more
classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   But McBride, who polls show is in a tight race with Bush, has
reserved his sharpest words for the governor's proudest educational
achievement: the testing-based accountability system pushed through
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Under Bush's plan, students take annual statewide exams in
reading, math and writing, and schools are graded based on student
performance. Schools that score highest receive bonuses; poorly
performing schools receive extra financial assistance, but their
students may be eligible for vouchers to pay for private schools.</TE>
<TE>   The plan has been hailed by conservative reformers and provided
something of a model for the federal law -- which will provide
stipends for after-school tutoring, rather than vouchers, for
students in consistently low performing schools.</TE>
<TE>   But in a debate this month, McBride denounced the Florida system
in terms rarely heard from candidates in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "High-stakes testing has never been supported by people who know
anything about how kids should be treated and how they should be
evaluated," he said. "A standardized test shouldn't be a determinant
of anything other than to find where kids are [academically], and
then you ... help them."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, McBride said he would continue giving the tests.
But he said he would scrap the Bush system that ranks schools by
their performance and eliminate the vouchers tied to those grades.
Instead, he would fold the test into a broader "report card" on
schools that would include "a whole host of criteria ... [such as]
class size, amount of money spent per capita in the classroom and
parent satisfaction surveys."</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts believe that, given his emphasis on the issue, a
McBride victory would spur politicians to intensify questioning about
testing and the new federal requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "The backlash is already out there, but a McBride victory could
demonstrate its strategic value as a political strategy," said Jay P.
Greene, a Florida-based education analyst for the Manhattan
Institute, a conservative think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has aggressively defended the focus on testing. "Today in
Florida, because we have assessments where there's a consequence,
we're now seeing that more children are reading at grade level," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the campaign's final days, Bush is charging that McBride's
plans will require him to raise far more in new taxes than the
50-cent-per-pack cigarette tax increase he has proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans also charge that in seeking to roll back the testing
and voucher systems, McBride is simply a tool of the powerful state
teachers' union.</TE>
<TE>   McBride denies that his agenda has been shaped by the teachers:
"The teachers have never asked anything of me."</TE>
<TE>   But the ties between his campaign and the 122,000-member Florida
Education Assn. are broad and deep.</TE>
<TE>   The union provided McBride his first major endorsement, invested
nearly $2 million in advertising that helped him upset former U.S.
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno for the Democratic nomination and has detailed
its longtime political director to serve as McBride's campaign
manager for the general election.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that commitment has been generated by opposition to Bush's
testing and voucher program, said Maureen Dinnen, the union's
president. "It ... puts the blame on teachers for everything that is
wrong in education."</TE>

<PH>THE SNIPER CASE</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Pair Had Little in Life Besides Each Other</HD>
<DH>John Allen Muhammad was a man who'd lost his children. His
constant companion, Lee Boyd Malvo, was a teenager who'd been
abandoned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan K. Stack and John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BELLINGHAM, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Even here, the two men stuck out: The sometime-hobo with easy money
and sharp dress who dragged an Army duffel around with him. He had a
companion, a Jamaican teen who kept his mouth shut and his eyes low.
They spoke little and failed much, this pair of drifters who slept
under the watchful gaze of an oil painting of Jesus in a shelter near
the port.</LD>
<LD>   Their story began here, on these hills of cedar and fir that slope
off toward Canada, in this town of hippies and fishermen and
vagrants. A local bartender calls Bellingham "a mecca for people who
want to be as far away as possible from where they're from." The
pair's journey ended when they were arrested, accused of pulling off
a string of sniper shootings that laced the nation's capital with
fear throughout October.</LD>
<LD>   They'd been on the run as long as they'd known each other, and
over time they became inseparable: a man who'd lost his children; a
boy who'd been abandoned by his parents. They just barely got by on
the fringes of America, so alone they took to calling themselves
father and son. It was last summer when they set off from this sleepy
town on a slow cross-country descent into disaster, much of which is
still a mystery. By the time they left, they didn't have much to
lose.</LD>
<TE>   John Allen Muhammad was a former soldier who'd gone to war but
earned no glory, who couldn't keep a job or a wife, who flailed
through the court system in a desperate -- and unsuccessful --
struggle to reclaim custody of his three children. He ended up
sleeping with them on the floor of an old stone shelter, and
eventually lost them for good when his terrified ex-wife spirited
them across the country to Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a guy, he's living in homeless shelters, his marriage has
disintegrated, his kids have vanished and the courts won't help him,"
said John Mills, a custody lawyer who took Muhammad's case without
charge. "All of those factors combine to disintegrate people."</TE>
<TE>   Lee Boyd Malvo was born of a teenage mother in Jamaica's slums and
was remembered by teachers as a sweet, disheveled child who seemed to
have been abandoned by his parents. He sneaked through this country's
back door in the belly of a cargo ship when he was 14 years old,
landed in Florida, then drifted to Washington, a clever, shy teen who
wanted badly to go to school. He was turned away from public schools
because he had no transcript. He was locked up by immigration
authorities. Finally, he was turned loose and ordered to appear at a
hearing this autumn. His days in America were likely to run out soon.
He had one friend in the world -- Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kingston, Jamaica, was a savage maze of murder in 1985. Drug gangs
ruled the streets in neighborhoods so heavily armed they were
officially dubbed "garrisons." It was in February that year that
19-year-old Una James checked into the Jubilee Hospital to give birth
to a baby boy named Lee Boyd Malvo.</TE>
<TE>   The father was builder Leslie Samuel Malvo, 39 -- more than twice
her age. He went on to marry twice and father several children. A man
of close-cropped salt-and-pepper hair and mustache, he blames James
for their son's misfortune.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a very bad woman, a very bad woman," he said, switching
between English and Jamaican patois. "If she never move out and
leave, this wouldn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   The young Malvo drifted north and found a home with an aunt in the
green hills of northern Jamaica. Slowly, the boy became more
disheveled, and said he couldn't do homework because his aunt made
him work.</TE>
<TE>   Winsome Maxwell stepped in and took Malvo into her family. "I
don't think he was getting any attention at all," the teacher said.
"I took him because he had nowhere else to go. He was getting very
quiet, his hair and clothes unkempt."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear where the paths of Malvo and Muhammad first crossed,
but it was probably in Antigua, where Muhammad and his three children
fled in 2000 to escape the cacophony of the bitter custody dispute. A
Persian Gulf War veteran, Muhammad was discharged from the Army and
separated from his second wife. He had a handful of failed businesses
under his belt. He lied about his mother to get an Antiguan passport.</TE>
<TE>   Malvo apparently passed through Antigua too. His mother was
working there -- she'd come to Jamaica once to visit her boy "and
cried and cried and cried," Maxwell recalled. Staff at St. John's
Seventh-day Adventist School told the Antigua Sun newspaper that the
young Jamaican studied there for a time. A security guard remembered
seeing Muhammad and Malvo at the hotel spa of the Jolly Beach Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad later told his lawyer he couldn't make a go of it in
Antigua. The phone lines and computers were behind the times, he
complained, so his vague notion of opening another business fell
apart. Dispirited, he made his way back to Tacoma, Wash., holed up
with some friends from the mosque and eventually wound up in
Bellingham. There, he and his three children shared a hallway in the
Lighthouse Mission with Felix, the shelter cat.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't any compelling reason," said Mills, the lawyer. "He
was just freeloading in Tacoma, so he moved up there."</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of 2001, Muhammad lost custody of his children, and
their mother took them. Muhammad was heartbroken. He spent months
asking friends and acquaintances where they'd gone. He couldn't find
them.</TE>
<TE>   It was during those days that Malvo appeared at his side. The two
became fixtures at the mission. They were arrested one day, charged
with shoplifting groceries.</TE>
<TE>   Malvo enrolled in Bellingham High School. He was an eager student
-- he had an uncanny knowledge of military history, told everybody
his father fought in the Gulf War and helped one of his classmates
study for a citizenship class. None of the kids knew he slept in the
shelter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was dinnertime in the shelter cafeteria, and Malvo was basking
in a rare moment of easy chatter. He cracked a joke, the staff broke
up and laughter rang from the round table. Then Muhammad slid into a
chair, put down his plate and shot an icy look across the table.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, manager Ray Reublin glanced up.</TE>
<TE>   "Muhammad gave him that look like your mother gives you when you
say something wrong, and he just clammed up like that," Reublin said,
snapping his fingers. "And I just thought, 'Wow, that's domination
right there. That's serious control.' "</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad was doing maintenance work for minimum wage at an
apartment complex north of town when he befriended a local woman. She
drove him around a bit, and he tinkered with her car. But the
friendship soon soured.</TE>
<TE>   His story didn't make any sense, she told her family. He was a
hard-luck drifter with money, a man who could pick up and fly to the
Caribbean whenever he got the inclination. She stopped seeing him and
told her family she'd called authorities to tell them she suspected
he was involved in some sort of illegal activity.</TE>
<TE>   She wasn't the only one asking questions. These were the days
after Sept. 11, 2001, and people were generally jumpy. The director
of the shelter has said that he, too, phoned authorities to tell them
he suspected Muhammad might have links to some illicit group.</TE>
<TE>   "He was rather secretive about his past and present,"
administrative assistant James Milton said. "He was closed-mouthed.
He didn't have a visible source of income, but he was able to travel
at a moment's notice."</TE>
<TE>   Some nights, Muhammad kept his mouth shut in the coffee shop,
hunched over the chessboard. Other times he held forth, bragged to
the artists and students that he was a music producer with big
connections in New York City. He flashed a wallet stuffed with cash.
He criticized the government.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere he went, Muhammad carried an Army duffel bag. He even
dragged it into the bathroom with him. And every time he wandered up
the road for coffee, Malvo tagged along.</TE>
<TE>   One day, real estate agent Greg Grant hired a man from the
downtown shelter to do landscaping work. A well-spoken stranger
climbed into the passenger seat and introduced himself as a teacher
from Jamaica. He'd been through a messy divorce and fallen on tough
times, he said. He had to hang around Bellingham to settle custody
woes. One morning he brought along a boy of about 11 and introduced
the child as his son.</TE>
<TE>   "He seemed really glad the kid was here, and I'd have said this
was a very loving relationship," Grant said. "This guy was a
marvelous worker, well read, a great conversationalist, well groomed,
well educated."</TE>
<TE>   But Grant, too, was troubled. One day, Muhammad hinted that he
needed a ride to the airport in Seattle. He was selling a house in
the Caribbean, Muhammad explained, and had to fly there to sign some
documents.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Look, I'm a real estate agent, and that's what Fed Ex is
for. You don't have to go there,' " Grant said. "He insisted he did.
I thought it was weird."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was a hot summer day when Muhammad came home to Baton Rouge,
La. He came tapping on Yvonne Bradford's door, Malvo at his side. He
put his arms around her. "How are you, Auntie?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   She hadn't set eyes on him in years. She'd watched him grow up,
though, after his mother died of cancer and her children were sent up
from New Orleans. His name was John Williams, and he was one of 11
children raised in a white frame bungalow with yellow trim. They
slept two or three to a bed, anywhere they could find space for a
weary body. They ate the butter beans, okra and tomatoes they grew
out back.</TE>
<TE>   When he resurfaced in Louisiana late last summer, Muhammad looked
skinny but healthy. He told everybody Malvo was his son and explained
that he'd wanted to show the boy where he came from.</TE>
<TE>   Malvo was polite, and spoke in a soft accent of "where I come
from," a home he didn't name where children were paddled and wore
uniforms. He sat down with a teenage "cousin" and marveled over the
music videos on television. "He said he didn't get to watch them
where he was from," cousin Sharon Holiday said. "He was interested in
basketball and politics."</TE>
<TE>   The pair toted crackers and smoked salmon in a rucksack, and
generally turned down the food the family tried to press upon them.
They said they were vegetarians, and they led the Baptist family to
understand that the dietary restrictions were part of Muhammad's
conversion to Islam. Malvo told one relative he couldn't eat anything
with feet.</TE>
<TE>   One afternoon, Malvo slipped outside to shoot baskets with Travis
Bradford, a cousin of Muhammad's. He told the other boy the
cross-country tour was a graduation present.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'You're one of the most mannerable kids I've seen in
a long time,' " Yvonne Bradford said. "He said, 'Yes, ma'am.' "</TE>
<TE>   The last night in Baton Rouge, Malvo and Muhammad ate a supper of
fish sticks and fruit juice at Holiday's house. Then they went into
the front room and fell asleep on the couch. When morning broke,
Holiday drove them to the bus station downtown. They climbed down to
the street. They said their goodbyes. And then they were gone.</TE>
<TE>   They never said where they were headed.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, on Sept. 11, Muhammad turned up in New Jersey. He'd
bought a blue Chevrolet Caprice in Trenton, and had it registered in
Camden.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was a sultry Saturday night on the outskirts of Montgomery,
Ala., and Kitty Simpson was sipping a glass of wine in her friend's
shop when the noise startled her to her feet. Bang! It sounded like
somebody had crashed a car into one of the brick pillars out front.
Simpson dashed to the door, then stopped short. Two women were lying
on the blacktop parking lot. A strange man stood over their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson wasn't the only one who heard the gunshots outside ABC
Beverages. A pair of police officers sped to the parking lot to find
the liquor store employees felled by gunfire. A man stooped over
them, rummaging through their purses. He glanced up, saw the police
and took off running.</TE>
<TE>   The younger officer dashed after him. They pounded over a ditch
and down Zelda Road, dodged through the traffic, sprinted past a
string of fast-food restaurants. The officer reached out, almost
grabbed the suspect but missed. A blue sedan veered between the two
men. The stranger put his hands on the car. Later, when investigators
went hunting for the vehicle in hopes of finding a fingerprint, it
was gone.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere near Wendy's, at the edge of Interstate 85, the stranger
melted into the maze of traffic, freeway and lawns. It was Sept. 21,
less than two weeks before the first shot was fired by the Beltway
sniper.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the police would recognize the man they had chased through
Montgomery as Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   The women had been shot at close range as they left the liquor
store. One of them died; the other took a bullet in the base of the
skull but lived.</TE>
<TE>   "Be safe," reads a sign at the liquor store. "Don't drink and
drive. God bless America."</TE>
<TE>   From a magazine dropped on the liquor store parking lot,
investigators lifted a single fingerprint. It belonged to Malvo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was still dark on the morning of Oct. 24 when authorities stole
into the Maryland rest stop and swarmed the Caprice. Muhammad and
Malvo were sleeping in the car. Bleary and matted, they were
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   It had been 22 days of fear in the schoolyards and streets of
Washington and the surrounding areas. A metropolitan region of 5
million people had come, almost overnight, to regard the act of
walking outside as a perilous endeavor. Everybody had been waiting,
angrily, desperately, for the sniper to be caught.</TE>
<TE>   It was dark outside by the time Yvonne Bradford's son rapped on
her bedroom door in Baton Rouge.</TE>
<TE>   "They know who the sniper is," she remembers him saying. "It's our
John."</TE>
<TE>   "What John?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Our John," he said.</TE>
<TE>   She turned on the television. The picture settled into focus.
Muhammad's face glowed on the screen. She would sit there all night,
staring at the television until the sun rose.</TE>
<TE>   "I was appalled. I said, 'It can't be John,' " Bradford said. "A
boy who grew up like John to do something like this. This is like a
nightmare."</TE>

<LD>Coast Guard crews and dockworkers slowly righted a container ship
carrying pulp, newsprint and lumber that was listing toward a pier in
Elliott Bay early Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Workers were unloading the Westwood Rainier about 3:30 a.m. when
they noticed it was listing, Coast Guard spokesman Rod Rooen said.
The 600-foot vessel brushed against two cranes on the pier, partially
tearing two electrical reels.</LD>
<LD>   No injuries were reported, Rooen said. Water was pumped out of
ballast tanks to stabilized the ships, a Port of Seattle spokesman
said.</LD>

<HD>WWII Plane Emerges From Ice to Fly Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIDDLESBORO, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Glacier Girl's hibernation is officially over.</LD>
<LD>   After spending 50 years in the heart of a Greenland glacier, the
World War II fighter plane flew Saturday for the first time since it
was pulled piece by piece from beneath almost 270 feet of ice and
snow.</LD>
<LD>   With propellers whirling and twin 1,275-horsepower engines
humming, the P-38 Lightning raced down the runway and lifted into a
gray sky for a 30-minute flight before an estimated 20,000 spectators
in this small eastern Kentucky town.</LD>
<TE>   "Seeing that plane lift off was just thrilling," said Brad
McManus, who had piloted one of the P-38s that crash-landed with the
recovered plane July 15, 1942. "It's a moment in time, a very special
moment."</TE>
<TE>   The plane, one of its era's fastest, was among six fighters and
two bombers forced by foul weather and low fuel to crash-land on the
glacier. It took rescuers on dog sleds 10 days to reach the 25 crew
members, but all of them got out safely.</TE>
<TE>   The planes were left behind to be slowly buried in snow and ice.
They might have been forgotten except for people like Middlesboro
businessman Roy Shoffner, who had become enamored with the
piston-engined, propeller-driven P-38s as a youngster.</TE>
<TE>   Shoffner, too young for World War II, imagined flying one of the
planes, which could reach 405 mph at altitudes as high as 35,000
feet. The United States built 10,113 P-38s; just 24 survive.</TE>
<TE>   Shoffner, a restaurateur, former banker and 1950s Air Force
fighter pilot, recovered one of the P-38s in the summer of 1992.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he got to Greenland, accumulated snow and ice had
squashed the plane flat.</TE>
<TE>   Crews used streams of hot water to melt a 48-inch-wide tunnel to
the plane and opened a cavern around it. Disassembling and retrieving
the aircraft took about four months and cost an estimated $638,000.</TE>
<TE>   Shoffner, 74, had a crew working for 10 years to restore the
plane, dubbed Glacier Girl, to like-new condition, tooling parts to
replace those destroyed by the ice.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,500 people a month have been coming to Middlesboro to
watch the restoration, which cost at least $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   One could see the appreciation in the tear-clouded eyes of Henry
Miller, 83, of Mount Juliet, Tenn., a former P-38 pilot.</TE>
<TE>   "That plane means something to me, because it has had it as tough
as I have," Miller said. "We've both survived."</TE>

<HD>Minn. Democrats Mourn the Face of Change</HD>
<DH>With the death of Sen. Paul Wellstone, the party faces the
challenge of finding a replacement that will continue to inspire
voter loyalty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>The air rang with defiant chants, with the soaring anthem "We Shall
Overcome." But in the dusk of a heartbreaking day, an aching lament
echoed louder still. Cupping candles against the drizzle, rubbing at
their tears, young and old, well and ill, gay and straight, black,
white, Hmong and Native American murmured to each other: "No one will
ever fill his shoes."</LD>
<LD>   Minnesota Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone, the fist-pumping,
uncompromising, proudly liberal crusader, was dead.</LD>
<LD>   His name would be added to the fabled roll call of Minnesota
populists: Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, an early champion of
Medicare; Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who called the Vietnam War immoral;
Vice President Walter F. Mondale; Gov. Orville Freeman; U.S. Supreme
Court Justices Warren Burger and Harry Blackmun -- these were men who
made Minnesota liberals proud by fighting for the poor, the sick, the
oppressed, both at home and on the national stage.</LD>
<TE>   On a tough Saturday of mourning and maneuvering, Minnesota
Democrats faced hard questions about who might carry on that
tradition.</TE>
<TE>   The immediate concern was finding a strong candidate to replace
Wellstone just a week before an election regarded as key to holding
control of the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   But there was a pressing need, as well, to win over voters who
loved Wellstone for his feisty independence -- but who saw little in
his party to inspire continued loyalty now that their hero was gone.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to become a Green because that's the only place where
people are still talking about these issues ... of the working man's
rights," said one such disillusioned voter, 65-year-old Karen Avaloz,
an artist. "I adored Wellstone, but I don't see anyone else in
politics who could hold a candle to him."</TE>
<TE>   The two-term senator, his wife and daughter and five others died
Friday morning when their turboprop plane crashed in northern
Minnesota. News of his death drew thousands of mourners to the state
Capitol by the day's end, including Karmit Bulman, 44, an activist
for battered women who was supposed to hold a fund-raiser for
Wellstone on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "They can select someone else to run, but it won't be the same,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside analysts agree that Minnesota's Democrats have been
foundering in recent years. The state's Democratic-Farmer-Labor party
came about from a long-ago merger between the Democrats and the
Farmer-Labor Party. Aggressively liberal, the DFL long had a lock on
statewide politics.</TE>
<TE>   But it was also insular -- tending to promote, as political
scientist Lilly Goren put it, "liberal Democrats and their sons, and
their sons, and their sons." The party tradition of picking
candidates for statewide office by caucus, rather than an open
primary election, may have perpetuated an old-boy network.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Democratic leaders] haven't known you all their lives, it's
very hard to break in with that system," said Goren, a professor at
the College of St. Catherine's in St. Paul. As a result, she added,
"the DFL may not have as big a farm team as they should."</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, the DFL reached for the old guard in selecting
attorney Hubert H. "Skip" Humphrey III, son of the former vice
president, to run for governor. He came in last in a three-way
contest that boosted ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura, an independent, into
power. This year's gubernatorial candidate, Roger Moe, is another
veteran DFL stalwart, serving as a state senator for 30 years. He has
been locked in a three-way tie, struggling to hold on to his
Democratic base in the face of a strong charge by another
independent, former Rep. Tim Penny.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of new faces has discouraged some voters, who consider it
a bit of a miracle that Wellstone -- an unknown college professor in
rumpled clothes -- managed to secure the DFL endorsement for the
Senate in 1990, then went on to beat a Republican incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Even after two terms in office, Wellstone retained a reputation as
an invigorating upstart in the Minnesota DFL, and in the Democratic
Party nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "He was fresher after 12 years [in Washington] than anyone I've
ever met," mused state Atty. Gen. Mike Hatch, a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   As his replacement, "I'd love to see some young blood," said John
Fields, 57, a disabled Vietnam veteran and longtime Wellstone fan.</TE>
<TE>   The rumor mill, however, is running hot with speculation that the
DFL will turn back to Mondale, though officials were reluctant to
make any public announcements while the effort to recover bodies from
the crash scene continued.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale, 74, has a sterling reputation among Minnesota liberals as
a dedicated public servant who pushes his causes with integrity, if
not charisma. Yet to some voters, the choice of an old-guard
politician to replace Wellstone would be depressing confirmation that
the DFL has grown too stale and cautious to carry on the fight.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll do it because he's one of them," Fields said, with a
gloomy sigh. "Someone young coming up with the same kind of
enthusiasm as Wellstone might want to change the way the party works,
and they don't want that. That's where I get discouraged."</TE>
<TE>   Yet some political analysts -- and, of course, DFL leaders --
insist that the party remains vibrant.</TE>
<TE>   "Our phone is ringing off the hook with people willing to help,
regardless of who is on the ballot," DFL Chairman Mike Erlandson said
Saturday. "I can tell you that a lot of people wanted to come back
today and start working to make sure the Democrats do not lose
momentum, from the top of the ticket on down."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Democrats can list dozens of other politicians who care
passionately about the same issues that motivated Wellstone, from
labor rights to civil rights, from environmental protection to health
care to the power of grass-roots activism. Mark Dayton, the state's
junior senator, is perhaps the best known. But there also are
populist voices in the state Legislature and in city halls across the
state. Among them is state Rep. Tom Rukavina. Wellstone had been on
his way to the funeral of Rukavina's father when his plane went down.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people who come from where Wellstone did,
politically," said Craig Grau, a professor of political science at
the University of Minnesota-Duluth. "But usually they represent just
a small section of the state."</TE>
<TE>   And to pick up votes in a statewide election in just a week "you
need visibility right away," Grau said. That's why Mondale
immediately vaulted to the top of almost every pundit's list for a
replacement candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale could be expected to carry on Wellstone's pet crusades,
because they reflect his values as well. Yet he lacks the raw energy
-- the image of an outsider taking on the establishment to fight for
the little guy -- that made Wellstone so popular. And, as some
analysts were quick to point out, liberal politics alone are no
longer an automatic plus in Minnesota. They haven't been, in fact,
for some time.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale barely managed to carry the state when he ran for
president in 1984. In the most recent presidential election, Al Gore
carried Minnesota by just 2 percentage points. For that matter,
Wellstone was running neck and neck with Republican challenger Norm
Coleman until the last few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Just days before his death, polls showed Wellstone pulling ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "We're becoming less distinctively liberal, and more like the rest
of the country," said Steven Schier, a political science professor at
Carleton College.</TE>

<CX>   Warren E. Burger -- A story about Minnesota's populist tradition in
Section A on Sunday incompletely characterized the record of former
U.S. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. Appointed by Richard Nixon, he
was a conservative Republican. But he also wrote several key opinions
that delighted liberals. He supported busing to end school
segregation, stricter regulation of gun owners, enhanced protection
for victims of sexual discrimination and a woman's right to choose
abortion.</CX>

<HD>Flukes, Fate Play Big Role in Fight for Senate Control</HD>
<DH>The death of Wellstone is the latest event to put policy
issues on the back burner this campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook and Miguel Bustillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The plane crash that killed Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) is just the
latest in a series of bolts from the blue that have buffeted the
national political parties in this year's bitter fight for control of
the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the biggest mood swings in this year's campaign have been
driven not by the big issues of war, peace and the economy, but by
flukes that have little to do with whether voters want Democrats or
Republicans to control the Senate and thus serve as a brake or
reinforcement to President Bush's policy initiatives.</LD>
<LD>   A Democratic senator from New Jersey drops out of the race at the
last minute because of questionable gifts he accepted. A Republican
candidate in Montana drops out, then jumps back into the race,
because of a Democratic Party television ad he considered scurrilous.
An Iowa Democrat gets in hot water because his campaign staff
apparently leaked a tape of a meeting of his GOP opponent.</LD>
<TE>   Every political campaign can be shaped by such unpredictable
episodes. But this year every local accident, scandal and quirk of
fate draws national attention because, with Democrats controlling the
Senate by a mere 50-49 margin -- before Wellstone's death -- the 2002
election has been one in which each Senate race could determine the
outcome.</TE>
<TE>   So when Wellstone's plane crashed Friday in northern Minnesota, it
was not just a tragedy for his family, his state and the liberal
causes he represented. It also was a big political problem for
national Democratic Party officials who have been on a roller coaster
throughout this volatile election cycle.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been an emotional time," said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.),
whose tenure as chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee has spanned last year's Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the
Capitol's exposure to anthrax. "You can't predict the future, and
there are paths you never expect to go down."</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party has until Friday to
announce who will replace Wellstone on the ballot. Party officials
say no decision will be announced until after Wellstone's funeral,
which will not be before Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But state and national party leaders have been putting pressure on
former Vice President Walter F. Mondale to come back into politics,
take Wellstone's place on the ticket and, with the strength of his
vast celebrity in the state, help the party keep that crucial Senate
seat.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Democratic Party stalwarts who have spoken to Mondale
about the race have been Murray, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) and AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney. Mondale has not
commented publicly on his plans, but he has said nothing to
discourage the speculation.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not said no, but he's not said yes," a top party strategist
said.</TE>
<TE>   Without Mondale, national party strategists say, Democrats will
have a harder time holding the seat -- and could lose control of the
Senate -- not because voters prefer the Republican agenda, but
because of an aviation tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials arrived Saturday to investigate the crash site
in Eveleth, Minn., and retrieve the remains of Wellstone, his wife
and daughter and five others. The National Transportation Safety
Board sent a team to the site, initially in search of a flight
recorder that, it turned out, the plane did not carry.</TE>
<TE>   Still in shock and mourning over Wellstone's death, leaders of
Minnesota's DFL Party met Saturday to discuss how to proceed in the
Senate race. But Wellstone's family and close allies still were
focused on efforts to properly memorialize him. State officials
acknowledged after the meeting that there was growing consensus that
Mondale would be the best choice as a replacement on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make sure Democratic leaders were all on the same
page," DFL Chairman Mike Erlandson said after the meeting. "We need
to remain unified."</TE>
<TE>   Some members of the Wellstone campaign want either to keep
Wellstone's name on the Nov. 5 ballot, which may not be legally
possible, or have his two sons receive consideration.</TE>
<TE>   State party officials said Wellstone's sons would have a say in
the matter of their father's succession and were under consideration.
Others, however, said the decision to go with Mondale was all but
official.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale, who turns 75 in January, served as senator from 1964 to
1976, has national clout and strong name identification. He has a law
practice in Minneapolis and has maintained a public presence in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   David Wellstone, who has been active in state politics and served
as political director for the gubernatorial campaign of Hubert H.
Humphrey's son Skip in 1998, is considered to more closely mirror his
father's liberal views and would permit the DFL to leave the
Wellstone name on the ballot, where it could garner many sympathy
votes.</TE>
<TE>   Though many state and national political analysts predicted that
the Wellstone tragedy would lead to a surge of support for
Minnesota's Democratic candidates and place Republican Senate
candidate Norm Coleman at a disadvantage, Coleman could well reap
benefits from the problems it will cause in the election process.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of absentee ballots were mailed out in Minnesota before
Wellstone's death, and many were beginning to trickle in. The effect
could be significant: More than 380,000 absentee ballots were cast
four years ago in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Officials will count votes for Coleman on those ballots, but not
votes for Wellstone. Instead, voters who cast ballots for the
incumbent senator prior to his death have the option of voting again
at the polls on election day.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time in a month that Democrats have had to
scramble to replace a Senate candidate late in a cliff-hanging
campaign. Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) last month abruptly dropped
his reelection bid because of nagging ethical questions raised about
gifts he had received from a supporter.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats turned to former Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), another
retired politician who, like Mondale, comes from the party's liberal
wing. As disruptive as that shift was, many Democrats believe they
are now in a better position to hold on to the seat than when
Torricelli was running for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   A more quirky ballot shift came in Montana, when Democratic Sen.
Max Baucus' GOP opponent, state Sen. Mike Taylor, abruptly dropped
out of the race to protest a campaign ad that he considered to
include slanderous allegations about his former beauty salon
business. A couple of weeks later, Taylor jumped back into the race,
which still is expected to end in a slam-dunk win for Baucus.</TE>
<TE>   Another race where a scandal abruptly shifted a campaign dynamic
was in Iowa, when Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin's campaign staff was
implicated in leaking a tape recording of a campaign meeting of his
GOP opponent, Rep. Greg Ganske. Harkin remains favored to win, but it
gave Ganske an unexpected boost at a time when the Democrat was
facing smooth sailing to reelection.</TE>

<HD>Bloomberg's Kind of Town: Smoke-Free N.Y.</HD>
<DH>Mayor favors ban at all clubs, eateries. Not all agree.
'We're going to fight,' one barman says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Where there's smoke, there's political fire.</LD>
<LD>   "You've got to be stupid, really dumb to smoke," said New York
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is trying to pass one of the nation's
toughest anti-smoking laws, a measure that would ban the practice in
all bars and restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   Ciaran Staunton, who owns O'Neill's bar in Manhattan, is equally
blunt about the mayor. "His law would put me out of business,"
Staunton said on a chilly afternoon as patrons puffed away and
knocked back pints of Guinness. "We're going to fight him with every
weapon we've got."</LD>
<TE>   The lines have been drawn in New York's great smoking war, and a
measure that looked like it might be approved quickly by the City
Council several weeks ago is now mired in a nasty political fight,
pitting Bloomberg against a potent coalition of tobacco lobbyists and
bar and restaurant owners.</TE>
<TE>   Hailed by public-health advocates for his tough stand against
secondhand smoke in the workplace, the mayor is colliding with a
deeply ingrained social tradition here: the right to drink and smoke
in public places.</TE>
<TE>   Under current city ordinance, approved in 1995, smoking is banned
in office buildings and in restaurants seating more than 35
customers. The proposed measure would cover all bars, restaurants,
outdoor cafes, private clubs and office buildings, affecting an
additional 13,000 establishments.</TE>
<TE>   As the City Council debates the measure, which is similar to a law
adopted by California in 1994 and one also on the books in Delaware,
national advocates on both sides are taking notice. If New York
passes the proposal, some believe, it could set off a domino effect.</TE>
<TE>   Neighboring Nassau County recently passed a similar measure, and
Suffolk and Westchester counties also are considering such a law. If
tough regulations are approved in all four jurisdictions, public
smoking would be severely regulated in the nation's largest
metropolitan area.</TE>
<TE>   "California is seen by millions as a cutting-edge place, filled
with concerns about health, or health-care nuts, depending on your
views," said John Banzhaf, who heads the Washington-based Action for
Smoking and Health, or ASH, one of the nation's oldest anti-smoking
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "But nobody ever accused New York of being filled with people
concerned about their health," he said. "It's a place where
neighborhood bars are a huge blue-collar tradition, and if New York
can pass such a law, people around the country might say, 'Hmm, maybe
we can do it too.' "</TE>
<TE>   This is a city, after all, where some taverns date to the 18th
century, and steakhouses are filled with cigar-puffing aficionados.
Neighborhood bars aren't simply businesses, they're gathering places
for locals, sponsors of youth sports teams and regular participants
in charity drives.</TE>
<TE>   Staunton says he would lose 20% of his business if people could no
longer smoke in his bar. But Bloomberg has framed the debate as a
workplace health issue, saying people shouldn't contract cancer from
secondhand smoke on the job.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to kill yourself, go ahead and do it," he told City
Council members in testimony this month. "But you don't have a right
to kill others. We're trying to protect workers."</TE>
<TE>   During a contentious City Council hearing, Health Commissioner
Thomas Frieden braved catcalls as he discussed the effect of
secondhand smoke. He said the average New York bartender breathes as
much air pollution during one minute in a smoke-filled room as a
pedestrian standing in the Holland Tunnel would in 60 minutes at rush
hour.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg has swayed many council members with this argument, but
some critics see it as one more example of a zealous political style
that has the mayor crusading against noise, traffic congestion and
other quality-of-life offenses with little regard for dissenters.</TE>
<TE>   City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, for example, has been slow to
support Bloomberg's bill, hinting that a modified version might
garner the 26 votes needed to pass a measure in the 51-member
council. Other council members may be poised to swap votes for
legislative favors in a year when the city is facing an unprecedented
$5-billion budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hurting fiscally," said Frankie Pellegrino, owner of
Baldoria's, a stylish Midtown restaurant. "And this is the mayor's
big issue?"</TE>
<TE>   "The food and entertainment business took a huge hit after 9 / 11,
and business is nowhere near back to the levels it was," he said,
having a smoke at the upstairs bar. "And frankly, I think I'd just as
soon pay the fines for violating this law, if it's enacted. I can't
tell people not to enjoy themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Many restaurant owners have lined up behind Bloomberg's proposal,
noting that an estimated 56% of the city's dining establishments
already ban smoking. The opposition comes mainly from businesses that
offer special smoking areas in bars, arguing that the existing city
law is sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   The debate is particularly acute in bars and restaurants, where
some employees prefer a smoke-free environment but worry that a
stricter law would cost them income, pointing out that smokers and
drinkers also tend to be big tippers.</TE>
<TE>   "I shouldn't get involved in this," said one bartender who refused
to be quoted by name, "because my feelings about health are not what
my boss thinks, and he's very much opposed to this legislation." In a
Midtown steakhouse, a waitress who regularly serves private parties
in banquet rooms filled with cigar smoke said: "It's not right for me
to get involved. But I don't have any problem with the smoke."</TE>
<TE>   At O'Neill's, customers debate the issue more openly. Greg Childs,
nursing a beer, said he loves to drink in bars but feels he shouldn't
have to endure clouds of cigar smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just losing one right after another in New York," Cora
Jennings said. "I drink and I smoke, and now somebody is telling me
that I just can't do it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The opposition doesn't faze Bloomberg, who has pushed his
anti-smoking measure tirelessly, even launching a publicly funded
$1-million advertising campaign against smoking. The mayor, who said
he gave up smoking cigarettes and cigars 17 years ago, believes
eliminating the practice would actually boost business in the long
run.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates cite studies from California suggesting that profits in
bars and restaurants have increased since the state's tough
anti-smoking law was passed. But Staunton and others are incredulous.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor seems to be saying that we should get rid of our
existing customer base, and then we can find a bigger one," he said,
heading to a political strategy meeting with bar owners from Queens
and Brooklyn. "We all know the mayor is a very wealthy man, a good
businessman, but I just have to ask him: Is this what they teach you
in business school?"</TE>

<HD>2 Dead, 6 Hurt in Okla. Gun Rampage</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OKLAHOMA CITY</DL>
<LD>A man apparently angered by a neighbor went on a shooting spree
Saturday in eastern Oklahoma that left two people dead and at least
six injured, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   They said the man was taken into custody after crashing his pickup
near a police roadblock.</LD>
<LD>   There was no immediate word on the conditions of the wounded. The
18-year-old suspect, whose name was not released, was being held at
Sequoyah County jail.</LD>
<TE>   The violence began about 5 p.m. in Sallisaw after the man was
confronted by a neighbor for reckless driving, said Kym Koch,
spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Koch said the suspect went into his house and another neighbor
went to his door to talk to him. Koch said the woman knocked but got
no answer.</TE>
<TE>   "She was walking away when the suspect came out with a shotgun and
shot the man who was getting onto him across the street," Koch said.</TE>
<TE>   The man survived, but the suspect fatally shot the woman and
wounded her husband, Koch said, before getting into his truck and
driving east on U.S. 64.</TE>

<HD>3 Victims, Linked Only by the Randomness of Violence</HD>
<DH>In the aftermath of the sniper shootings, families and
friends seek to cope with their losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- They had little in common except for the ordinariness
of their errands in Maryland and Virginia. Now they are joined in
history, victims of a suburban sniper who terrorized a region and
frightened a nation.</LD>
<LD>   Lori Ann Lewis-Rivera was vacuuming Cheerios out of the back of
her van at a Shell station. Premkumar A. Walekar was pumping gas so
he could begin his daily run as a cabby, while Dean Harold Meyers was
buying gasoline before heading home after a long day as an engineer.</LD>
<LD>   In a shooting spree that lasted three weeks and left 10 dead and
three injured, Walekar was victim No. 3, Lewis-Rivera was No. 5 and
Meyers was No. 9. In the aftermath, with two suspects in custody,
families and friends of the three are seeking ways to cope with their
losses. They are remembering their loved ones not for how they died,
but for how they lived.</LD>
<TE>   Lewis-Rivera was everyone's favorite nanny, an Idaho girl who
married a Honduran immigrant. Walekar emigrated from India to ensure
that his two children would have the opportunities he wished for
himself. Meyers was wounded in Vietnam, the recipient of a Purple
Heart.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been so much focus on how they died, but each one has a
story," said Jeff Carter, pastor at the Church of the Brethren in
Manassas, Va., where Meyers worshiped. "They reflect different
ribbons of humanity. They are of different ages, different
professions, different socioeconomic backgrounds, a smattering of
America."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dean Harold Meyers served with Company B, 5th Battalion, 7th
Cavalry Regiment, 1st Air Cavalry Division. On March 8, 1970, he
volunteered for a reconnaissance mission in Phouc Vinh, north of
Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   He was hit in the left arm, above the elbow. Doctors removed
tendons from his wrist to reconfigure his arm but told him he would
be permanently disabled. Within a year he was playing basketball,
riding his motorcycle and back home with his family in rural
Pennsylvania, enrolling at Penn State University.</TE>
<TE>   There was a girl back then, and they were sweet on each other, but
Dean's brother Greg recalled that she wanted to marry a minister.
Dean was a Christian and a churchgoer, but he wanted to be an
engineer. Something about the profession appealed -- the attention to
detail, the problem-solving.</TE>
<TE>   He adored children, and war buddies recalled that even in Vietnam,
whenever they returned to base, local kids would greet him. They knew
that he saved candies or trinkets for them.</TE>
<TE>   He died at 53 a bachelor, a doting uncle to his nine nephews and
two nieces. He took them to Boston's Fenway Park for baseball games,
offered rides in his classic Corvette, always sent birthday cards and
brought Christmas presents. When they visited him in Washington, he
often took them to the Smithsonian Institution, sharing his love of
history. "All the kids were really special to him," his brother Greg
said.</TE>
<TE>   An outdoorsy type, Meyers liked to jog, play tennis and canoe. He
rarely spent money on himself. He bought his manual Canon AE-1 camera
secondhand, and even his cars -- perhaps his only indulgence -- were
hardly extravagant. The 1990 white Isuzu Trooper had logged 172,000
miles, the gray Mazda Protege, which he was fueling when he died, was
nothing fancy.</TE>
<TE>   But his family was surprised to learn after his death the extent
of Dean Meyers' charities. They were unaware that he had for years
sponsored several children from the ages of 5 to 18 through World
Vision, an international Christian humanitarian organization. They
learned that he had turned down $1 million for serving as executor of
a friend's will, saying the fee was excessive.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes at the office he wore a cowboy hat, but colleagues knew
him as anything but a cowboy. "His death really shook the office up,"
said Gary Kirkbride, branch manager for the Dewberry &amp; Davis firm in
Manassas where Meyers worked. "It wasn't just that it was shocking,
period. It was shocking that it would happen to Dean. There isn't a
more likable, gentle soul in the office."</TE>
<TE>   He never talked about his war injury, which left ugly scars, or
much about the war in Vietnam. But in 1972, amid the wrenching
passions stoked by the antiwar movement, he wrote an essay that reads
now like a coda for more recent traumas.</TE>
<TE>   "The American dream has not soured over the years," he wrote.
"Perhaps we have a distorted view of our past history, believing that
at one time our nation was virtuous and now is corrupt.... How can we
forget we were once a nation under the siege of Civil War.... Once we
condoned the buying and selling of a human life? Where was the
American dream during those dark years? No, we have not fallen, but
rather are rising."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hers was the most prosaic of moments frozen in terror, vacuuming
the family van. She had just dropped her 3-year-old daughter off at
school, and was running errands before picking up the 5-year-old boy
whose family had hired her as a nanny.</TE>
<TE>   Lori Ann Lewis was a child of Mountain Head, Idaho, who wanted to
see a broader world. In the seventh grade she decided to become a
nanny. As soon as she finished high school, she packed herself off to
Northwest Nannies Institute in Lake Oswego, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   When she stepped off the plane in Washington to move in with her
first family, she carried a huge three-ring binder filled with
projects she planned for the children.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd come home for dinner and she had the kids making placemats
and hats and food" from a new country, recalled her first employer,
Ellen Weiss, a producer at National Public Radio.</TE>
<TE>   She started attending Washington Temple, a Mormon church near the
home she shared with Weiss, her husband and their two children. There
she met Nelson Rivera, a landscaper from Honduras who spoke no
English. And although she spoke no Spanish, somehow she sensed in him
a kindred spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't speak a word of English. She didn't speak a word of
Spanish. But they understood each other. It was love at first sight,"
Nelson Rivera's brother Antonio said at her wake.</TE>
<TE>   She was remembered as patient and loving, a big girl with a huge
mane of blond hair who would envelop the children.</TE>
<TE>   But Lewis-Rivera, 25, also was very focused.</TE>
<TE>   "She was determined to create a life for herself," Weiss said.
"She was determined to make her marriage work, to buy a house. Even
if it took saving $25 a week, she would have seen it through. She
knew what mattered most to her."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Nelson Rivera is determined to raise their daughter the way
his wife would have. "He knew exactly what Lori wanted," said
Lewis-Rivera's last employer, who asked not to be identified. "They
shared the same values."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He was only 18 when he came to the U.S., thirsty for a college
education that his father, a taxi driver, would be hard-pressed to
afford back home in Pune, India.</TE>
<TE>   Premkumar A. Walekar was a teddy bear of a man even then,
5-feet-10 and packed with energy. He came to Montgomery College 36
years ago because an uncle lived there. But he soon dropped out of
college. He wanted to make money for his family, to give them the
chances in life he didn't have.</TE>
<TE>   So he took up driving, as his father had, becoming a distributor
for a publishing company, supplementing his income with a second job
as a cabdriver. In the tradition of Indian culture, he took one look
at a picture of Margaret Umapati and flew to India to marry her. She
worked as an obstetric nurse, often on night shifts, so their time
together was precious. On weekends they went to church -- they were
Seventh-day Adventists -- and he drove her anywhere she wanted to go.
She didn't drive, and driving was what he knew best.</TE>
<TE>   The children came one after the other: Andrea is 24, Andrew, 23.
Prem gave them the advantages of a suburban childhood, but still he
saved enough money to bring several family members to the United
States. They called him Prem Dada, the big brother. He even sent
enough money to India so his father could buy his own taxi, something
so rare that it is recalled still through tears.</TE>
<TE>   Prem Walekar's hands were big and calloused, the mark of a
physical man. He used them too in the kitchen, where Andrea recalled
him cooking spicy omelets in the mornings before school while her
mother slept after a night shift at the hospital. She thinks he had
the soul of a chef.</TE>
<TE>   He was also a favorite with the children. He was a notorious
cheek-pincher, and one cousin claims to this day that one of her
cheeks is lower than the other because of the force of Prem Walekar's
teasing affection.</TE>
<TE>   The Walekars had bought a house in Pune, and were hoping to move
there once their daughter married. They wanted to retire, to travel,
to enjoy life.</TE>
<TE>   When he was killed, Prem Walekar, 54, was filling up on gas after
buying a lottery ticket. Andrea says the family hoped it would come
back a winner, a final tribute to a man who made his own luck.
Instead, it came back stained with his blood.</TE>

<HD>Legwork, Missteps on Sniper's Trail</HD>
<DH>A grueling investigation by a task force of 2,000 finally
turns on a suspect's mistakes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun, Judy Pasternak and Lisa Getter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>ROCKVILLE, Md.</DL>
<LD>The faces were always there, their gazes unavoidable.</LD>
<LD>   For three weeks, police detectives and federal agents searching
for the deadly Washington sniper were haunted by the grainy
photographs left on a white mat board inside their command post. The
faces belonged to the victims, placed as a silent shrine in full view
of every weary investigator who approached the nerve center of the
task force's suburban Washington headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   They were there to goad the searchers on, bringing the victims to
life for hundreds of investigators who knew them only in death. But
the faces also mocked the investigators.</LD>
<TE>   "It kept eating away at us when a new face went up on that board,"
said Montgomery County, Md., Assistant Police Chief Dee Walker. "But
all that time, it kept a little fire lit in the backs of our minds.
That's what kept a lot of us going, remembering who we were there
for."</TE>
<TE>   Even after John Allen Muhammad, 41, and Lee Boyd Malvo, 17, were
arrested Thursday in the murder spree that turned everyday life in
the Washington suburbs into a landscape of surreal dread, those 13
faces -- 10 dead and three wounded -- remained as a grim reminder of
the sniper's ability to kill and kill again.</TE>
<TE>   The largest serial murder manhunt in recent memory took three
nerve-racking weeks to track down a roving team of killers whose
rampage around Washington's Beltway deviated from any of the standard
criminal patterns known to veteran investigators. Despite throwing
2,000 officials into the breach, the investigation was repeatedly
stymied by suspects whose moves were as jumbled as the trash-littered
back seat of the blue Chevrolet Caprice that police say they
transformed into a rolling sniper's nest.</TE>
<TE>   At times, the dragnet was racked by missed opportunities and
infighting. A Baltimore policeman questioned the two men but turned
them loose because he had no way of recognizing them. A Virginia
sheriff agonized over a witness' suspicion of a 1990 Caprice; the
report, which did not jibe with stories of white vans and box trucks,
ended up being filed away. Federal agents rushing to search for clues
after one shooting were momentarily held off by local police. Even
one of the killers left a letter berating the police for
"incompitence" after he was hung up on six times by tip-line
operators who could not winnow the wheat from the chaff.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the center of the massive operation and on its
fringes, however, came away from the manhunt impressed with the task
force's ability to run down even the most obscure leads and keep
nearly two dozen suspects under 24-hour surveillance at the same
time.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the massive government resources, overwhelming numbers
and sheer persistence, the investigation turned on the suspects' own
missteps, which gave investigators the final critical links to close
in on them.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys failed at pretty much everything they did," said one
senior federal law enforcement official on the task force. "They were
hard to come to grips with because they were only efficient at two
things: killing and getting away. And eventually, they failed at
that."</TE>
<TE>   Leads Still Turning Up</TE>
<TE>   Even with the suspects held in a Baltimore detention center,
authorities said their investigation continues to turn up new leads.
Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * Federal forensic experts are analyzing a laptop computer that
was found inside the Caprice seized when the two men were arrested at
a rural Maryland rest area on Thursday. Investigators hope to learn
more about the pair's motives by downloading the computer's files.</TE>
<TE>   * Law enforcement officials now suspect that a Sept. 14 rifle
shooting at a Montgomery County shopping center was a prelude to the
killings that began on Oct. 3. Task force officials had earlier said
ballistics tests of bullet fragments found after the wounding of a
liquor store employee there were inconclusive. But a senior federal
official said Saturday that "we're pretty sure it's the work of the
same guys."</TE>
<TE>   * FBI officials in Philadelphia said Saturday that Nathanel O.
Osbourne, a Jamaican national who was co-owner of the Caprice used by
the sniper suspects, had been arrested in Flint, Mich. Investigators
want to know if Osbourne had any role in aiding Muhammad and Malvo.</TE>
<TE>   Despite frustration about failing to end the murder spree sooner,
federal agents and police detectives who worked inside the massive
law enforcement hierarchy chipped away with every available resource,
improvising when nothing else worked.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery County police officers were told at morning roll calls
to approach people at 7-Elevens and ask if they had information or
knew witnesses. FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
negotiators carefully crafted public communiques used by Montgomery
County Police Chief Charles A. Moose to appeal to the killers --
attempts to quell the killers' homicidal urges while federal agents
worked behind the scenes to swab their letters for fingerprints and
DNA samples and tap the pay phones they used.</TE>
<TE>   "They had to rewrite the book as they went along," said an
admiring Douglas M. Duncan, the Montgomery County executive whose
region of 800,000 people was shattered by six murders -- five in a
single day.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Chief Walker was on duty the morning the first alerts
came in from Aspen Hill, the suburban community of rolling hills and
strip malls racked by the sniper's bloody first day of violence. As
she huddled with detectives, Walker, 41, an 18-year-veteran, knew
instantly that police were dealing with a crime spree unlike anything
they had experienced.</TE>
<TE>   By day's end, after five more people had died and the killers
remained free, it was apparent no other American community had
either.</TE>
<TE>   "It just didn't fit with anything we'd ever seen," Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there had been a similar shooting on Sept. 14, in Silver
Spring, Md. But detectives were uncertain at the time whether the
wounding of a liquor store employee there had been deliberate or was
a misfire.</TE>
<TE>   County police moved quickly, sending teams of detectives to each
new murder site. The county's prosecutor, State's Atty. Douglas F.
Gansler, sent his own top deputies, Katherine Winfree and John
McCarthy, to the crime scenes.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutors were startled by the killer's ability to "kill
randomly and methodically at the same time," Gansler recalled. Duncan
was in a meeting of public officials in Chicago when Moose paged him.
"We've got three dead," Moose told him. Leaving the meeting, Duncan
got another call. Four dead. In the cab to the airport, the cell
buzzed again. A fifth had died.</TE>
<TE>   "What in the world is this?" Duncan recalls thinking. "It was
absolutely bizarre, horrifying."</TE>
<TE>   Already, stunned witnesses were telling Montgomery County's
beleaguered detectives that they had seen a white box truck drive off
from one of the Connecticut Avenue crime scenes. After more
questioning sessions over the next several days, detectives came up
with white box truck sightings at three murder sites.</TE>
<TE>   But that first day, police had to make a hasty decision on whether
it was worth putting out an alert for the truck based on the single
witness sighting. Walker said she was well aware of the "possible
pollution" that might result.</TE>
<TE>   But it was all they had to go on. Investigators said witnesses --
surprised by the sound of gunfire at many of the crime scenes --
provided chaotic accounts that frustrated detectives.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, witnesses look for the weapon. But there was none to be
seen. Investigators say the suspects hid in the trunk of their blue
Caprice, firing through a punched-out hole. Many witnesses mistook
the sound of gunfire for a car backfiring.</TE>
<TE>   A Mysterious Caprice</TE>
<TE>   The immediate obsession with white box trucks -- and later, white
vans -- repeatedly obscured what later turned out to be solid leads.
At least 10 times after the first spate of killings in Montgomery
County, police sighted the Caprice near the shooting scenes and ran
its license number against computer files but came up empty.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime on Oct. 3, after the sniper had already killed five
Montgomery County residents, a D.C. officer ran the license tag on
the Caprice "several hours before the homicide here in the city,"
said D.C. Metropolitan Police Sgt. Joe Gentile. "Nothing came back on
the tags."</TE>
<TE>   At 9:15 that night, Pascal Charlot, 72, was shot in the chest as
he stood on a street corner, blocks from the Montgomery County line.
Nearby, a witness spotted a Caprice, its lights off.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, the Caprice was spotted again by a witness near
where a woman was wounded by rifle fire outside a Michaels craft
store in Fredericksburg, Va.</TE>
<TE>   The sketchy description languished on an interview sheet, alone
among the flurry of white vehicle sightings. "Everyone was keyed in
on this white van," said Spotsylvania County Sheriff Ronald Knight.
"The problem is, they're everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   When Kenneth Bridges was gunned down on Oct. 11, Knight had just
deviated from his normal patrol route, which would have taken him
right past the gas station where the sniper struck. Instead, Knight
arrived five minutes after the shooting, too late to see the Caprice
"probably driving slowly away."</TE>
<TE>   Two days after the first Spotsylania shooting, a Baltimore
policeman noticed a Caprice parked in a gas station lot.</TE>
<TE>   He took Muhammad's name down and logged it into a database of
police contacts. But no alarm bells sounded, and soon the Caprice was
gone.</TE>
<TE>   Walker and other task force officials acknowledge the close calls
that could have cracked the case -- but they also sympathize with a
"cop who was just doing his job. He had limited information and no
probable cause to arrest them."</TE>
<TE>   The next day, the sniper wounded a 13-year-old boy outside a
middle school in Bowie, Md. The attack put the city on warning that
all residents, even children, were fair game.</TE>
<TE>   Even as ATF officials verified that the youth was the sniper's
latest victim, the task force was in full swing. Teams of FBI field
agents drove from Baltimore and profilers arrived from the bureau's
Quantico, Va., lab. ATF forensics experts moved in to supervise crime
scene searches and search firearms records. The task force set up
first in Montgomery police headquarters, then in a field office down
the street. As more agents arrived, officials blocked off floor after
floor. A command structure fell into place.</TE>
<TE>   Moose, FBI Special Agent Gary M. Bald and ATF Agent Michael
Bouchard were the public faces of the investigation. Working behind
them was another trio: Montgomery County Major Crimes Capt. Bernard
Forsythe, FBI Assistant Special Agent Steve Wiley and his ATF
counterpart, James Cavanaugh. They were the day-to-day supervisors
who sorted through the information flow from field agents and
dispatched teams to the latest shooting scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Agencies Cooperate</TE>
<TE>   The three agencies worked together fairly smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   But there were sparks between Maryland officials and their
Virginia counterparts. When FBI and ATF teams converged Oct. 14 on a
Home Depot parking lot where FBI analyst Linda Franklin lay mortally
wounded, the federal agents were held back for several minutes by
Fairfax County, Va., police who insisted they would manage their own
crime scene, recalled task force officials.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax County Police Chief Tom Manger said the momentary chaos
"wasn't unique to our scene." Within minutes, more than 200 federal
agents and task force officials swarmed onto the murder site.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't anything for them all to do," Manger said. "Someone
had to run the scene."</TE>
<TE>   FBI and ATF negotiators began playing a critical role soon after
police found a tarot card -- with its death skeleton and "I am God"
message -- at the middle school crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clear by then we were dealing with someone who was pretty
delusional," said one investigator, "but what his delusion was wasn't
as important as the fact that he was trying to communicate with us."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, even as they readied well-practiced strategies,
investigators were startled by the killer's constant evolution. "It
didn't fit the traditional or even the nontraditional models of a
murder case," Walker said. "It didn't even fit the models of serial
murders we were used to."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and ATF profilers concluded that the task force was
confronting a unique sort of threat.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt we had some spree killers," the investigator said. "Maybe
two. The prevailing thought that it was a group of Columbine types"
-- a reference to the high school killers who massacred students in a
Denver suburb in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Only recently have investigators learned the squalid conditions
that the suspects operated in. A sandwich shop employee who saw the
Caprice just before it was stopped by the police officer in Baltimore
peeked into the vehicle and saw a mound of dirty shirts in the back
seat.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects stayed at a YMCA in Richmond, one official said, the
night before allegedly shooting a man in the parking lot of a
Ponderosa steakhouse in Ashland, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "They spent a lot of time sleeping at highway rest stops," one
investigator said.</TE>
<TE>   The night of the Ashland shooting, police found a three-page note
tacked to a tree where the shooter probably stood.</TE>
<TE>   It was from the killers, a ranting diatribe laced with obscure
references from the Five Stars, a reggae group, and demands for a
$10-million ransom.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys were making it up as they went along," said one
federal investigator.</TE>
<TE>   The killers demanded that the ransom be placed in a Bank of
America account or "prepare you body bags." They threatened in a
menacing postscript that "your children are not safe anywhere at any
time."</TE>
<TE>   A Big Break</TE>
<TE>   But the disordered minds of the killers also tightened the police
noose around them. Astonishingly, the killers jotted down the names
of police operators they had called and even referred to a "priest at
Ashland" they had called.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic priest, Msgr. William Sullivan, was debriefed
by FBI agents, a task force investigator said. They left with a
crucial tip; during the bizarre, rambling phone conversation with the
priest, the killer used his familiar "I am God" refrain, but also,
oddly, mentioned Montgomery, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   As investigators contacted Alabama authorities, then flew south to
search through old murder cases, FBI and ATF negotiators tried to
contact the killer and keep him talking long enough to trace his
calls.</TE>
<TE>   But the only phone call that came in was a chilling, garbled
communication.</TE>
<TE>   "It was incredibly amateurish," said another federal official. "We
could barely make out the words. 'You didn't do what I said. I tried
to get with you. You got our letter and you do what we want.' "</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents traced the call back to a phone booth at a Richmond
gas station. Police set up surveillance nearby, but they had missed
the killer by 10 minutes. When they swooped down on a white van
parked by the phone, they netted only a pair of terrified Latin
American immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after detectives returned from Montgomery with a lead and a
fingerprint from Malvo, the names of John Muhammad and Lee Malvo were
scrawled on a chalkboard at the command post.</TE>
<TE>   For two weeks, police commanders and federal supervisors had
scrawled the names of the most compelling suspects on the board. At
times there were as many as two dozen.</TE>
<TE>   Some were "gun nuts," said one investigator. Others had suspicious
white vans and box trucks. Others were acting strangely. Some had
been disappearing at the same time the killings occurred.</TE>
<TE>   But most were eliminated soon after their names were posted. The
day that Dean Harold Meyers was shot to death at a Manassas, Va., gas
station, one federal investigator watched glumly as another walked up
to the board and erased the names of nine suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "You watch something like that and you feel pretty miserable," the
investigator said.</TE>
<TE>   But by Thursday, the names had dwindled to two.</TE>
<TE>   Dee Walker had spent all day telling herself not to get her hopes
up. When she saw Capt. Forsythe, her top homicide man, Walker asked
him: "How are you going to keep everyone on track if this one doesn't
pan out?"</TE>
<TE>   "You just do," Forsythe said.</TE>
<TE>   Walker kept her emotion in check as the evening wore on.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted it to be over so bad, but I didn't want to get my hopes
up," she said. "So many decent leads went up in smoke."</TE>
<TE>   Even when the two men were awakened at gunpoint in Myersville,
Md., then hauled out of their Caprice and driven off to a Montgomery
County jail, Walker refused to relax. It was only late Thursday, when
ATF agents returned with ballistic test results that showed a
telescope-equipped rifle found in the Caprice had been used in 11 of
the shootings, that she finally let go.</TE>
<TE>   She was not inside the command post when the word came. But Walker
heard the staccato applause. It echoed down from the floor where the
faces of the dead still kept watch.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when I knew it was over," she said.</TE>

<HD>Baze Raises His Win Total to 8,000</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a day when thoroughbred racing's eyes were focused thousands of
miles east, jockey Russell Baze made some history at Bay Meadows.</LD>
<LD>   The man who dominates the standings annually in Northern
California became the fourth rider to win 8,000 races, joining Laffit
Pincay Jr., Bill Shoemaker and Pat Day.</LD>
<LD>   Baze, 44, earned the milestone victory on Ourwhistlebritches, a
2-year-old daughter of Roar who was making her first start for owner
Jim McGee and trainer Bill Morey.</LD>
<TE>   The 5-2 favorite in the field of 10 $20,000 maidens,
Ourwhistlebritches quickly sprinted clear under Baze and was never
seriously challenged.</TE>
<TE>   Baze, who won No. 7,999 earlier with sixth-race favorite Viva's
Pride, became the youngest jockey to reach 8,000. Pincay was 46, Day
was 47 and Shoemaker, the first to 8,000, was 49.</TE>
<TE>   Baze, a native of Vancouver, Canada who long ago clinched his 28th
riding title at Bay Meadows, rode his first winner -- Oregon Warrior
-- for his father on Sept. 16, 1974, at Yakima.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to say it has been a wonderful ride up until now,"
Baze said during a brief winner's circle ceremony after the race.
"I've got a lot more years left in me, so it will be fun to see what
happens the rest of the way."</TE>
<TE>   By the time he is finished, Baze could wind up passing all of
those ahead of him on the list. Pincay, who won once Saturday at
Santa Anita, leads with 9,439; Shoemaker, who retired in 1990, has
8,833; and Day has 8,339. The retired David Gall is fifth with 7,396
victories.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shine Again once again showed her affinity for wet tracks with a
two-length victory over 9-1 shot Redheat Riot and three others in the
$150,000 First Flight Handicap at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by the Bohemia Stable and trained by Allen Jerkens, the
13-10 second choice and defending champion in the Grade II saved
ground throughout under jockey Jean-Luc Samyn, came through an
opening along the rail and drew clear. She completed the seven
furlongs in 1:23 3/5 over the sloppy surface. She has won four of six
on off tracks and the win was her seventh in 25 starts.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little surprised he went inside with her," said Jerkens.
"Things could have gotten a little hairy down there, but everything
worked out. If she's going to run next year, that's probably it for
[2002]. If they breed her next year, she'll probably run in the Top
Flight," a $150,000 race Nov. 29 at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Raging Fever, the 11-10 favorite in a field reduced with the
scratches of Nonsuch Bay and Shiny Band, who would have raced coupled
with the winner, finished third.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tenpins, the 1-2 favorite, rolled to a 1 3/4-length victory over X
Country and two others in the $156,122 Fayette Stakes, the
closing-day feature at Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   A 4-year-old son of Smart Strike, Tenpins won for the seventh time
in 10 starts for owner Joe Vitello and trainer Don Winfree. Craig
Perret was the winning rider and Tenpins completed the 1 1/8 miles in
1:51 on the muddy track.</TE>

<LD>Texas heard all week about its 84th-ranked offense and struggling
running game.</LD>
<LD>   The Longhorns responded by saying the ground game would come.</LD>
<LD>   Did it ever.</LD>
<TE>   The No. 7 Longhorns gained 245 yards rushing Saturday in a 21-10
victory over No. 17 Iowa State at Austin, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Cedric Benson ran for 199 yards and two touchdowns in 30 carries
-- among them a 59-yard run that put Texas ahead in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We were tired of playing like we weren't a top team," said
Benson, who had 45 carries for 113 yards in the previous two games
while playing with a nagging turf toe injury.</TE>
<TE>   "It started to make some guys sick."</TE>
<TE>   Texas (7-1, 3-1 in conference) sealed its 17th consecutive victory
at home on Selvin Young's two-yard touchdown run in the fourth
quarter. The play capped an 80-yard drive that chewed up more than
nine minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long time since we had a 19-play drive that changed
the momentum of the game for us," Texas Coach Mack Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State (6-3, 3-2) has lost two games in a row since cracking
the top 10 for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 Kansas St. 44, Baylor 10 -- Darren Sproles ran for 124
yards and a touchdown, making up for his two fumbles, and the
Wildcats (6-2, 2-2) returned an interception and a blocked field-goal
attempt for touchdowns in a victory at Waco, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Sproles is the first Kansas State running back in 29 years with
four 100-yard games in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Andino's 34-yard field goal in the first quarter broke a
streak by Baylor (3-5, 1-3) of almost 139 minutes over nine-plus
quarters without a point.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Colorado 37, Texas Tech 13 -- Chris Brown ran for 149 yards
and a touchdown and Robert Hodge passed for two touchdowns for
Colorado at Boulder, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado (6-2, 4-0) posted its fifth consecutive victory and held
one of the nation's most potent offenses to 359 yards -- 125 yards
below the Red Raiders' average.</TE>
<TE>   Kliff Kingsbury, the nation's leader in completions, attempts,
yards passing and touchdown passes, was 36 for 65 for 268 yards and
no touchdowns for Texas Tech (5-4, 2-2).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Missouri 36, Kansas 12 -- Brad Smith ran for 117 yards, including
a 75-yard touchdown on a quarterback draw, and backup tailback T.J.
Leon added 104 yards rushing and two touchdowns for Missouri (4-4,
1-3) at Columbia, Mo.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Iowa Hawkeyes beat Michigan so badly that they were able to
celebrate and sing with their fans in a mostly empty Michigan
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "I enjoyed that," Iowa Coach Kirk Ferentz said after Iowa's 34-9
victory Saturday at Ann Arbor, Mich. "I'd be lying if I said I
didn't."</LD>
<LD>   Brad Banks threw three touchdown passes as the 13th-ranked
Hawkeyes handed the eighth-ranked Wolverines their worst home loss
since 1967.</LD>
<TE>   "Wow, that's a long time," Banks said when told of the fact. "It
was real fun being in the Big House and doing some big things."</TE>
<TE>   The Hawkeyes (8-1 overall, 5-0 Big Ten Conference) won their sixth
consecutive game and beat Michigan for the first time since 1990, the
last time Iowa won a Big Ten title.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan (6-2, 3-1) had won four straight. The last time the
Wolverines lost this badly at home was a 34-0 defeat to Michigan
State on Oct. 14, 1967, two years before Bo Schembechler became head
coach.</TE>
<TE>   "It was embarrassing," said running back Chris Perry, who was held
to 14 yards in nine carries.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa scored 21 straight points after Markus Curry fumbled a punt
return in the third quarter, just after the Wolverines had cut the
deficit to 10-9. Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said the play was the
game's turning point.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, it was tough sledding," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawkeyes are in good position to at least earn a share of the
conference championship, with home games remaining against Wisconsin
and Northwestern before the regular-season finale at Minnesota. Ohio
State is not on their schedule.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin 42, Michigan State 24 -- Brooks Bollinger threw three
touchdown passes and ran for two others to help the Badgers (6-3,
1-3) end a losing streak at three with a victory over the Spartans
(3-5, 1-3) at East Lansing, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Bollinger, knocked out of last week's loss to Ohio State with a
concussion, led Wisconsin to touchdowns on three of its five
first-quarter possessions.</TE>
<TE>   The win, the 90th in Coach Barry Alvarez's Wisconsin career, was
vintage Badgers: strong running and few mistakes. They gained 313
yards on the ground, including Anthony Davis' 170 and Dwayne Smith's
110. *</TE>
<TE>   Illinois 45, Indiana 14 -- Antoineo Harris ran for a career-high
four touchdowns and 176 yards as the Fighting Illini (3-5, 2-2)
defeated the Hoosiers (3-5, 1-3) at Champaign, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Harris scored on runs of one, four, 28 and five yards, and he was
taken out of the game after playing only one series in the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana scored two touchdowns late in the game to avoid being shut
out. The Hoosiers have lost nine straight in Champaign dating to
1979.</TE>
<TE>   The four rushing touchdowns by Harris were the most for an
Illinois player since Howard Griffith ran for eight in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Purdue 42, Northwestern 13 -- Brandon Jones and Joey Harris ran
for more than 100 yards apiece as the Boilermakers (4-5, 2-3) totaled
407 on the ground and beat the Wildcats (2-7, 0-5) at Evanston, Ill.,
for their first road victory in more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Jones rushed for a career-best 165 yards in 20 carries, and Harris
gained another 132 yards in 27 attempts and scored twice. Jerod Void
also ran for two touchdowns, and freshman quarterback Brandon Kirsch
threw for two as Purdue piled up 551 yards of total offense.</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern lost its fifth consecutive game and 10th in a row in
the conference.</TE>

<HD>Volponi Does End Run Around Odds in Classic</HD>
<DH>The 43-1 longshot wins Breeders' Cup showcase by 6 1/2
lengths and knocks horse-of-year picture out of focus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill.</DL>
<LD>The last time there was a shock this big in the Breeders' Cup Classic
was when Arcangues, a sore-backed interloper from France, won at
133-1 in 1993. Volponi is as American as they come, despite the name
that ends with a vowel, and he's sound from top to bottom besides,
but that price next to his number on Arlington Park's tote board
Saturday was an Arcangues-like payoff.</LD>
<LD>   Against a field that was designed to settle any horse-of-the-year
debates, Volponi only jumbled the issue in front of 46,118
spectators, and probably sent the title in the direction of a filly
for the first time since Lady's Secret in 1986. Beating the Classic
favorite, Medaglia d'Oro, by 6 1/2 lengths -- biggest margin in the
19-year history of the race -- Volponi won a Grade I race for the
first time, won for the first time outside greater New York and made
his 77-year-old trainer, P.G. Johnson, the oldest conditioner to win
a Breeders' Cup race.</LD>
<LD>   Is it any wonder Volponi paid $89 for $2? Thirty-three selectors
tried to pick the Classic winner in the Daily Racing Form, and only
one nailed Volponi. That her name is Karen Johnson is no coincidence.
P.G.'s daughter wouldn't want to get on the bad side of her dad,
would she?</LD>
<TE>   As the longest price in the race, at 43-1, Volponi made a shambles
of the Classic. Medaglia d'Oro's horse-of-the-year chances went
south, as did those of War Emblem, Came Home and Evening Attire. War
Emblem, the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, finished eighth
after running second for about a mile. Came Home, a 3-year-old who
had already beaten older horses, was 10th. Milwaukee Brew finished
third, missing second by a neck, and after him came Evening Attire,
beaten by almost 10 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   When the 250 or so Eclipse award voters cast their ballots in late
December, the likely favorite will be Azeri, who began the eight-race
Breeders' Cup card with a five-length victory for her eighth win in
nine starts this year. Azeri has never faced males, which Lady's
Secret did with success during her title year, but the electorate can
be expected to overlook that in the wake of Volponi's upset.</TE>
<TE>   "Horse of the year is up to [the voters]," said Laura de Seroux,
who trains Azeri. "But my filly has put together a record like we've
seldom seen."</TE>
<TE>   P.G. Johnson, who was elected into the Racing Hall of Fame in
1997, had had only two Breeders' Cup starters before Saturday; they
finished fourth and sixth in the 1990 event at his home track,
Belmont Park. He bred Volponi and races him in a partnership that
includes another of his daughters. Edward Baier bought 50% of the
4-year-old colt in the beginning, for $75,000. After running 1 1/4
miles in 2:01 1/5 Saturday with Jose Santos, Volponi earned $2.08
million.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have taken [the Classic purse] a lot of years ago," said
Johnson, referring to some lean years. "The horses in front of us
were getting tired and my horse was strong. Maybe we caught some
horses going the wrong way."</TE>
<TE>   Volponi had won six of 22 starts, two of the wins coming on grass,
and Johnson had considered running him in the Breeders' Cup Mile, a
turf race.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a natural mile-and-a-quarter horse, and he's as good on dirt
as he is on turf," Johnson said. "The Mile is a million-dollar race
and the Classic is [almost] $4 million, so just do the numbers."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Volponi had won only two of seven races, and in his
last four -- three on grass -- he had been coming close without
winning. On Oct. 4, running 1 1/8 miles on dirt at the Meadowlands,
he finished second as the favorite.</TE>
<TE>   "He was too far back, and I wasn't happy," Johnson said. "I wanted
to blame the jockey [Shaun Bridgmohan], but after I watched the tape
a couple of times, I saw he was riding the horse, but the horse
wasn't responding. So I decided to run him in this race with
blinkers, like I had earlier."</TE>
<TE>   Santos, who had ridden Volponi twice before, regained the mount
because Bridgmohan elected to stick with Evening Attire, his regular
mount.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't surprised [to win] at all," Santos said. "I told my wife
three days ago that he would win. This horse has been doing
wonderful. I think the blinkers back on made the difference. I've
ridden him on the grass, but he never had that kick."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and his wife Mary Kay, who met on a paddock bench at the
old Washington Park track in their native Chicago, are celebrating
Volponi as well as their 57th wedding anniversary today. Late
Saturday, Mary Kay got teary-eyed as she told about how tough the
last couple of years have been for her husband. Johnson has undergone
three operations for prostate cancer, the most recent about three
weeks ago, and he was walking around Saratoga in a neck brace this
summer after falling in their leased home near the upstate New York
track.</TE>
<TE>   "Through all of this, except for the days he spent in the hospital
he missed only five days at the barn," Mary Kay Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   While E Dubai and War Emblem battled up front, and while Medaglia
d'Oro and Perfect Drift closely attended them, Santos had Volponi in
fifth place. Nearing the quarter pole, Volponi moved into second
place, and several jumps later, with the three-sixteenth pole
approaching, Johnson turned to his wife in their seats and said:
"You're going to be very proud of this horse."</TE>
<TE>   The track, Medaglia d'Oro's jockey Jerry Bailey said, didn't favor
his horse. There was rain during the week, and on Saturday, as the
day unfolded, the track went from muddy to good to fast.</TE>
<TE>   "I wished it could have been either sloppy or dry," Bailey said.
"They might have said it was fast [for the Classic], but it wasn't.
It was between wet and dry. But he tried, and ran his best, and you
have to tip your hat to the winner."</TE>
<TE>   After coming within one win of sweeping the Triple Crown, War
Emblem lost three of his last four starts.</TE>
<TE>   "He got out of the gate good," jockey Victor Espinoza said, "but
on the first turn I had to tap on his shoulder a little bit. He's a
great horse, but he never got into the race the way he used to."</TE>
<TE>   Volponi is a son of Cryptoclearance, out of the Johnson-trained
mare Prom Knight, who cracked her knee and was retired after one
race.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to ride the father," Santos said. "I'm on top of the world
right now. A lot of people say well, it's a lot of money. The money
helps, but the prestige of the race is more important."</TE>

<HD>Azeri Stirs Emotions</HD>
<DH>Filly's win in Distaff brings bittersweet memories to
surface for De Seroux and Paulson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill.</DL>
<LD>It was an emotional, dewy-eyed day for the people surrounding Azeri
as the brilliant 4-year-old filly, making a rare appearance outside
California, racked up a five-length win in the Breeders' Cup Distaff
at Arlington Park on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Trainer Laura de Seroux thought about her mentor, the late Charlie
Whittingham, and choked up. Michael Paulson, who heads the family
trust that manages Azeri, thought about his deceased father, Allen
Paulson, who bred the filly.</LD>
<LD>   "I know Charlie was watching," said De Seroux, only the second
female trainer to saddle a Breeders' Cup winner. The other is Jenine
Sahadi, who won the Sprint with Lit de Justice in 1996 and with
Elmhurst in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   Whittingham, a Hall of Famer, had been the oldest conditioner to
saddle a Breeders' Cup winner -- Sunday Silence in 1989 -- until P.G.
Johnson, a year older at 77, saddled Volponi for his upset win in
Saturday's Classic.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish my dad could have been here," Michael Paulson said. "This
filly is in a league of her own. She's a super horse. She's a gift
left by my father."</TE>
<TE>   Azeri, winning for the 10th time in 11 career starts, thrust
herself into horse-of-the-year consideration, and could very well win
the title after all of the leading contenders were outrun by Volponi.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Smith, who rode Azeri, also won another race, the Juvenile,
with undefeated Vindication, who stamped himself as the early
favorite for next year's Kentucky Derby, even though a Juvenile
winner has never won the Derby. Jockey John Velazquez also had a
two-win day, aboard Storm Flag Flying in the Juvenile Fillies and
Starine in the Filly and Mare Turf. The other winners were Orientate
in the Sprint, as trainer Wayne Lukas added to his Breeders' Cup
record with a 17th win; the Irish import High Chaparral in the Turf;
and Domedriver from France in the Mile as the heavily favored Rock Of
Gibraltar settled for second, unable to completely overcome a poor
start.</TE>
<TE>   Finishing second to Azeri was Farda Amiga, another
California-based filly. Take Charge Lady, the Eastern threat who had
figured to be Azeri's chief rival, was sixth in the eight-horse
field.</TE>
<TE>   Azeri ran a fast opening six furlongs in 1:09 3/5 and never
stopped. Her final time for 1 1/8 miles was 1:48 3/5.</TE>
<TE>   "She just cantered across the finish line," Paulson said. "She's
run a [1:08 4/5] under 127 pounds [four more than Saturday], so this
wasn't surprising."</TE>
<TE>   Smith hiked his Breeders' Cup win total to 10, which ranks him
behind Jerry Bailey with 13 and Pat Day with 12.</TE>
<TE>   "She could wind up being the greatest [filly] ever," Smith said of
Azeri, who is scheduled to keep running next year. "The race went
just like I dreamed last night. Every step of the way was a
celebration. She went out there like a rocket, the best she's ever
broke."</TE>
<TE>   A look at the other races:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Juvenile</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bob Baffert, breaking an 0-for-20 Breeders' Cup slump,
saddled his third winner in the series and ran 1-2-4 with
Vindication, Kafwain and Bull Market. Hold That Tiger, who broke in
the air at the start, recovered to finish third.</TE>
<TE>   "Even running a mile and an eighth [a one-time extended distance
for what has been a 1 1/16-mile race] didn't bother him," Baffert
said, "and that's encouraging. We don't need to run him again [this
year]. We'll freshen him up before we run him again next year. We've
got a lot of bragging rights before that comes."</TE>
<TE>   Vindication, a $2.15-million yearling purchase by Satish Sanan, is
undefeated in four races at three tracks. He's a son of Seattle Slew,
the 1977 Triple Crown champion who died this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Juvenile Fillies</TE>
<TE>   In a gutsy effort, Storm Flag Flying was passed by Baffert's
Composure inside the eighth pole, but came back to win by half a
length. Storm Flag Flying is undefeated in four starts.</TE>
<TE>   "Against any other horse we would have won," said Smith, who rode
Composure. "But we ran into a champion and a half today."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sprint</TE>
<TE>   Lukas only had two starters this year, both in the Sprint.
Orientate, who went in with a four-race winning streak, wore down the
longshot Thunderello to win by half a length. Lukas' other horse, Day
Trader, finished 11th, and Kona Gold, trying to win the Sprint for
the second time, ran fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Orientate is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, who belonged to a
partnership that won the 1994 Juvenile with Timber Country, but this
was their first outright Breeders' Cup win. The Lewises ran second
and third in Saturday's Juvenile Fillies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turf</TE>
<TE>   High Chaparral, ridden by Mick Kinane for trainer Aidan O'Brien,
beat With Anticipation by 1 1/4 lengths. Favored at 9-10, High
Chaparral had won four of five starts in Europe this year, and
finished third in the Arc de Triomphe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mile</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien's Landseer, a 3-year-old colt who had earned almost $1
million, suffered a compound fracture of the right front cannon bone,
just below the knee, and was euthanized.</TE>
<TE>   Landseer, who was making a promising late run, was threatening
before he went down at the top of the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   The Mile winner, Domedriver, paid $54. He beat Rock Of Gibraltar
by three-quarters of a length for only his sixth win in 16 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Rock Of Gibraltar, at 4-5, had won seven straight Group One races
in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Filly and Mare Turf</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel tried to sell Starine one race after he
bought her in France in 2001, but nobody would meet his price.
Winless in three starts this year, Starine thrives on the yielding
turf that she ran over Saturday, and punched out a 1 1/2-length win
over Banks Hill, who won the race last year.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel also recently began training Banks Hill for Juddmonte
Farms.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bittersweet result," Frankel said. "I beat my biggest
client. I might not have a job tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Starine paid $28.40. Frankel is the first owner-trainer
combination in the Breeders' Cup since Sonny Hine, who co-owned Skip
Away with his wife Carolyn, saddled the colt for a 1997 win in the
Classic.</TE>

<LD>Dismissing the bowl championship series rankings as arcane, out of
touch and borderline irrelevant, with an impossibly complex formula
"that often results in mockeries," Sally Jenkins of the Washington
Post writes:</LD>
<LD>   "I've decided to start my own poll ... the Jenkins Personal Index.</LD>
<LD>   "The JP Index is based on the following criteria: How often the
school's name appears in my newspaper, one-tenth of a percent. Color
scheme of uniform, one-tenth. Whether a school's mascot is a nice
animal or not, six-tenths. Mascot animals with eyes in the front of
their heads receive bonus points, as opposed to mascot animals with
eyes on the sides of their heads."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Jenkins: The columnist, daughter of "Semi-Tough" author Dan
Jenkins, offers her own top 10:</TE>
<TE>   "1. Army. Name me a school with a tougher strength-of-schedule
factor. The Cadets have to face Afghanistan, North Korea and Iraq.
Plus, they have to play all of their big games on the road.</TE>
<TE>   2. Oklahoma. In addition to having the best coach and best defense
in the country, Sooners play in a place that legitimately produces
golf ball-sized hail.</TE>
<TE>   3. The University of Chicago. They dropped football years ago. I
just miss them.</TE>
<TE>   3. The Cincinnati Bengals. At 0-6, they should be downgraded to an
NCAA team, and sent to the Humanitarian Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   4. Bowling Green. Unbeaten, and people still think they're a
bowling school.</TE>
<TE>   5. Penn State. Because my friend Ann went to school there.</TE>
<TE>   6. Texas Christian University. It will make my father so happy.</TE>
<TE>   7. The Bethesda Chevy Chase, Md., High School state champion field
hockey team, because as the BCS has proved, an index wouldn't be an
index if it didn't have a howler in it.</TE>
<TE>   8. Nebraska. Because I have sympathy for the world's downtrodden.</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the first amateur player drafted by the Los
Angeles Kings?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Get mean, Ming: Houston Chronicle columnist Dale Roberts gave
7-foot-5 center Yao Ming an overall positive review for the rookie's
debut before the home fans in the Rockets' exhibition game Thursday.
But he's not rushing to put Yao's name on the Hall of Fame ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike most men his size -- not that very many are his size -- he
is an extremely smooth and polished product. What he needs, it
appears, are more rough edges.</TE>
<TE>   "And meaner elbows."</TE>

<TE>   What, no Eddie Gaedel? Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe doesn't think
the fans did their best in choosing baseball's 10 most memorable
moments.</TE>
<TE>   "The 20- and 30-somethings have had their say. Baseball, according
to them, was invented sometime around 1970. If they think the most
memorable moment in baseball history was Cal Ripken breaking Lou
Gehrig's record, then all I can say is that it's America, and they
are all entitled to an opinion."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Defenseman Rick Pagnutti, 1967. He never played in
the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Joe Hall of the Detroit News lists the top baseball
free-agents as Greg Maddux and Jim Thome, then writes, "Two words sum
up the Tigers' odds of getting them. 'Fat' and 'chance.' "</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Concern Is Contract Fallout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Piatkowski is concerned.</LD>
<LD>   Can you blame him?</LD>
<LD>   He has always been a Clipper. He knows this could be the best of
the nine Clipper teams of which he has been a part, and he
understands what's at stake for the franchise and for the players and
the coaching staff.</LD>
<TE>   A good season could get the Clippers into the playoffs for the
first time since 1996-97. A great season could get them deep into the
postseason for the first time since the club was born in Buffalo,
N.Y., in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski believes it all depends on the Clipper players, and
that's what worries him. The team failed to resolve a number of
contract matters during the off-season, including a new deal for
center Michael Olowokandi and a long-term extension for forward Elton
Brand. Olowokandi and Brand need new contracts for 2003-04, and so do
Piatkowski, Andre Miller, Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom.</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski believes uncertainty over their contracts could lead to
selfish play if some players decide to pad their statistics in an
attempt to drive up their individual values for negotiations next
summer.</TE>
<TE>   "If we play together, we're going to be good," he said Saturday.
"If we don't, it's going to be a long, frustrating season. I'm hoping
with Andre out there [as the team's new point guard] that he runs
everything nice and smooth. We'll see what happens starting
Wednesday."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers begin the regular season Wednesday against the
Cleveland Cavaliers at Staples Center. Piatkowski is expected to lose
his starting spot as the team's shooting guard, trading places with
former sixth man Quentin Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm worried," Piatkowski said when asked about the team's state
of mind. "I wish they had gotten at least a couple of deals done over
the summer."</TE>
<TE>   From what he has seen during training camp and in eight
exhibitions, Piatkowski believes Miller will keep the Clippers
playing like a team. The Clippers acquired Miller, the NBA's assist
leader last season, from Cleveland during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if we put the ball in his hands when the game is tight,"
Piatkowski said of Miller, "he's going to find a way to get it done.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Elton is going to play the right way. He's going to get
his rebounds and a lot of his points come off rebounds.... But there
are a couple of other guys I'm worried about.... You need guys who
are great team guys, who are real rah-rah guys. If you look at all
the top teams, they have those kinds of guys."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Hand Back a Victory</HD>
<DH>The losing streak and soul searching continue as the team
lets go of a late-game lead in a loss to the Oilers at Edmonton.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EDMONTON, Canada</DL>
<LD>Now the mental juggling act begins.</LD>
<LD>   The Mighty Ducks had a game in hand, one of those hard-to-come-by
road victories all-but handed to them. Yet, they were the ones with
heads down in the dressing room, after bobbling a two-goal lead in
4-3 loss to the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Soul searching was in full swing even before the crowd of 16,375
had finished filing out of the SkyReach Center. The Ducks are living
proof that no lead is safe, especially when they are the ones
leading.</LD>
<TE>   This was the third time in four games that they let a lead go
late.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally you tend to dwell on this until midnight," Duck Coach
Mike Babcock said. "Tomorrow will be a new day. We got to be
regrouped and get back at."</TE>
<TE>   Being daylight saving time Saturday, the Ducks had an extra hour
to ponder what happened to their 3-1 lead over the Oilers, who had
won only one of their first five games.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the kind of thing that has happened to us every year,"
Mike Leclerc said. "We have to stop it now. It's not a personnel
thing. We can't let teams back into the game."</TE>
<TE>   Let the Oilers back in? The Ducks practically dragged them kicking
and screaming like a child who didn't want to go.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were set to snap a seven-game losing streak in Edmonton,
which seemed merely a formality after the first period. Unfortunately
for the Ducks, they treated it as such.</TE>
<TE>   The Oilers responded with three goals in a 13-minute span during
the third period, two on the power play. Defenseman Eric Brewer
scored one and assisted on the other two, including the game winner.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks turned the puck over, which led to Brewer centering a
pass to Brian Swanson. His one-timer beat goalie Jean-Sebastien
Giguere with 3 minutes 12 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "You could feel it shifting in the first period, when we were up,
3-1," Leclerc said. "They kept coming at us and eventually it gave
them enough momentum."</TE>
<TE>   This is getting repetitive.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks let a lead slip away.</TE>
<TE>   Each time, Babcock has said the same thing, "we got to keep our
foot on the gas."</TE>
<TE>   Each time Duck players have vowed much the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a big learning experience for our young hockey team,"
Petr Sykora said. "It doesn't happen over night."</TE>
<TE>   There were moments the Ducks could point at, some out of their
control, which cost them Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere could cry foul, after being called for obstruction
interference on Ethan Moreau with the score tied, 3-3. Giguere seemed
to merely graze Moreau, who went down. Moments later, Swanson scored.
Even Moreau said, "I'm not sure what happened there."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere said: "I don't want to comment on that. You guys saw it,
let's leave it at that."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere had a chance to freeze the puck before the goal. Instead,
he tried to flip it to Paul Kariya. The Oilers ended up with the puck
and produced the game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   Everything was going right for the Ducks early, and they hardly
had to do a thing.</TE>
<TE>   Oiler goalie Tommy Salo was having an Olympic-type performance.
Not a good thing, considering Salo's memorable Olympics involved a
lazy shot going off him and into the net, giving Belarus a victory
over Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Sykora scored the first two Duck goals, one with the Ducks
short-handed. Mike Leclerc whirled and fired a shot past a
stunned-looking Salo for a 3-1 lead 11:32 into the first period.</TE>
<TE>   That ended the night for Salo and, as it turned out, for the
Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Said Babcock: "They skated, we stood still."</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Oates' Absence Is Already Being Felt</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU> Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>EDMONTON, Canada</DL>
<LD>Center Adam Oates had screws removed from his broken left hand
Saturday. He will be out at least a month.</LD>
<LD>   Oates, who was injured against Vancouver on Thursday, was
noticeably absent in a 4-3 loss to Edmonton on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Rookie Stanislav Chistov filled in well on the power play, taking
Oates' spot along the boards. Chistov assisted when the Ducks scored
on their first power play.</LD>
<TE>   But they missed Oates in the face-off circle, one of his
specialties. The Ducks won only 41% of their faceoffs. The Oilers won
eight of 11 faceoffs in the third period, when they scored three
goals.</TE>
<TE>   With Oates, the Ducks had won at least 55% of their faceoffs in
their first seven games.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks will likely recall center Jason Krog from minor league
Cincinnati to fill Oates' roster spot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Sebastien Giguere was back in goal Saturday night. It wasn't
a pleasant return.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Martin Gerber was brilliant in goal, going 1-0-1 in the
Ducks previous two games. Giguere, meanwhile, has not played at last
year's level.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to learn from the negative things and focus on the
positive," said Giguere, who made 23 saves and gave up four goals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Petr Sykora had two goals Saturday, one of which was a brilliant
effort while the Ducks were short-handed. Sykora carried Mike York on
his back and still managed to flip a shot over goalie Tommy Salo's
shoulder.</TE>

of 608 yards on offense, a 20-point burst in the third period that
turned everything after 44-19 into garbage time, and a balanced
offense that suddenly had a slashing rusher in the form of Fargas to
give Palmer the kind of relief and offensive variety he has needed
for his entire nine-year career at USC (or is it eight and just seems
like nine?).</TE>
<TE>   USC fans haven't had these kinds of lofty feelings since, well,
the 1996 Rose Bowl, when the Trojans sent Northwestern back to the
realities of academia, 41-32.</TE>
<TE>   But even those days, near the end of John Robinson's second era,
didn't have the potentially explosive feel that these Trojans give
off. Remember, Robinson's '95 Trojans got to the Rose Bowl despite
losing their regular season final to hated UCLA, as well as losing in
midseason to more-hated Notre Dame. It was a nice season, but with an
asterisk that read: Lost to Irish and Bruins and won Rose Bowl, but
against a bunch of bookworm geeks.</TE>
<TE>   No, this one feels different. With the sudden emergence of Fargas,
who was a starter at Michigan so long ago that hardly anyone
remembers that, or the serious leg injury that nearly cost him his
career, USC has as balanced and potent an offense as any team in the
country. And entering the game, the Trojans were 13th in the country
in total defense and tops in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   USC, 4-1 in the conference, has four games left, three in the
Pac-10. The possibilities are unlimited.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans play at Stanford on Nov. 9, and the best thing about
Stanford is now standing along the sidelines during Notre Dame games.
After Stanford is a game at the Coliseum against Arizona State, which
plays conference favorite Washington State next Saturday at Pullman,
where the Sun Devils will find little sun and a devil of an opponent.
Then there is the ever-competitive (except last year) UCLA game,
where the Bruins probably will have to go with a quarterback who was
just out of diapers when Palmer threw his first Trojan pass back in
the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   And then, of course, come the Irish, currently unbeaten and moving
up the national rankings, as are the Trojans, who entered Saturday's
game a notch below Oregon at No. 15. That game will be in the
Coliseum on Nov. 30, and it, like today's Trojans, has the makings of
the good old days of one of the greatest rivalries in college
football.</TE>
<TE>   So, it was hard to fault Carroll, in his second year and still a
bit new to this Trojan lore stuff, if he bubbled over after the win.
Matter of fact, this one turned out to be a "four-jacked" win, as in
"I'm jacked, " the phrase he used four times in his postgame news
conference. Carroll is in the top five of America's most-excitable
football coaches anyway, and that's after recovered fumbles in
practice, so you can imagine what a 44-33 pasting of Oregon can do
for him.</TE>
<TE>   It also had to be a nice moment for Carroll to be able to smile,
walk across the field at the end of the game and shake hands with
Oregon's Mike Bellotti, who two years ago turned down the Trojan job
that eventually went to Carroll.</TE>
<TE>   So, from a season that stutter-started a bit with a loss at Kansas
State in the third game and fostered doubts when Washington State
took a 30-27 squeaker at Pullman comes championship talk, and BCS
thoughts and real chances at beating both Notre Dame and UCLA in the
same year, something the Trojans have not done since 1981 and the
days of Marcus Allen.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, USC fans, it has been 21 years.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, who with his total of 796 yards and nine touchdowns
passing in his last two games suddenly might be as good a Heisman
candidate as anybody in the country in a year when nobody has really
emerged, said that he hated Oregon and so did the entire Trojan team
-- that's what a four-year losing streak will do for you -- and added
that Saturday's victory was "a championship game."</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe not quite. Matter of fact, maybe there is more ahead
even beyond a Pac-10 title.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the best is yet to come.</TE>

<LD>If the Breeders' Cup ultra pick six wasn't enough for you, there is
another potentially lucrative pool to shoot for today.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody has hit the pick six in the first three days of the
Aqueduct meet, so there is a carryover of more than $221,000 for
today. There was no pick six at the New York track Saturday because
Aqueduct had only five live races.</LD>
<LD>   The pick six begins with the third race and ends with the eighth,
which is the $75,000 Pilgrim Stakes for 2-year-olds. The race is
scheduled for 1 1/8 miles on the turf, but it rained Saturday, so the
Pilgrim might be run on the dirt.</LD>
<TE>   There is another stakes in the sequence. Fifteen 2-year-old
fillies were entered in the $75,000 Miss Grillo, also at 1 1/8 miles
on the grass.</TE>
<TE>   If the Miss Grillo stays on the turf, One And Twenty, who is two
for two on the lawn, may be the one to beat.</TE>
<TE>   Today also marks the start of Churchill Downs' fall meet. The main
event is the $100,000 Ack Ack Handicap, a Grade III at 7 1/2
furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Binthebest, who has won four of seven over the track, is the one
to beat under jockey Jon Court.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Dance Dreamer will try for his first graded
stakes victory against only five rivals in the $150,000 Carleton F.
Burke Handicap at Santa Anita. The Burke goes at 1 1/2 miles on the
grass.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Pat Day. The jockey won another riding title at
Keeneland and is the odds-on choice to keep it going at Churchill
Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Ryan Morris and Caesar Bisono. The jockeys, through
Friday, were a combined seven for 157 at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: Exacta boxes keying Captian Bell in the fifth
with Kinetic Bend, Treasure Hunt and Olympic Success.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 6/54. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $30.40/$304.20. Total money bet: $356.</TE>

<HD>Seminole Moment for the 8-0 Irish</HD>
<DH>Notre Dame dominates Florida State on the road, 34-24, and
proves it is a serious contender.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Notre Dame football has gone from a luck story to a truck story, in
this case a runaway, leprechaun-driven, 18-wheeler.</LD>
<LD>   Say what you want about early-season escape acts against Purdue
and Michigan State, quarterback Carlyle Holiday's phantom touchdown
to beat Michigan, that crud-of-a-dud victory over Pittsburgh and even
the fact the Irish trailed Stanford, 7-3, late in the third quarter.</LD>
<LD>   What No. 6 Notre Dame is now, after Saturday's 34-24 victory over
No. 11 Florida State in front of 84,106 at Doak Campbell Stadium, is
8-0 and a national-title contender.</LD>
<TE>   The echoes are not only awake, they're chewing No-Doz.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish did not merely bus into Tallahassee and leave with a
victory, they came in as underdogs and left Florida State
shell-shocked.</TE>
<TE>   The Notre Dame team that finished 5-6 only last year is a myth,
that George O'Leary hiring debacle already a faded memory.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish, 10-point underdogs against a 5-2 team, so thoroughly
dominated a formidable foe on the road they removed all doubt about
their top-10 legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   "You would think it would," Irish linebacker Courtney Watson said
of the victory afterward, "but who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Don't look for Notre Dame to abandon its one-game-at-a-time
mantra, if only because players have learned to mimic the school's
one-word-at-a-time coach, Tyrone Willingham, who almost playfully
wondered out loud Saturday whether his team would be favored at home
next week against Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the first words gleeful players saw when they entered the
visitors' locker room at Doak Campbell Stadium were as succinct as a
Willingham sentence: "BEAT BOSTON COLLEGE."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, there was no denying the weight of the victory Saturday. Even
Irish Athletic Director Kevin White described it as "a Notre Dame
moment."</TE>
<TE>   The Irish once again won by leaning on their defense, only this
time it was Florida State they were leaning on.</TE>
<TE>   Any question about whether Notre Dame meant business was answered
on the game's first play from scrimmage, when Holiday teamed up with
Arnaz Battle on a 65-yard touchdown pass, a play Holiday and Battle
had rehearsed all week.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew the first call on Tuesday in practice," Holiday said. "We
thought about it in our rooms Friday night."</TE>
<TE>   The play immediately dictated the terms and put Florida State on
the defensive. The Seminoles fought back to make it a 10-10 game in
the third quarter before the Notre Dame defense and special teams,
once again, blew the game open in what seemed like seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Watson started the onslaught when his interception and 21-yard
return of a Chris Rix pass set up Nick Setta's go-ahead, 35-yard
field goal.</TE>
<TE>   On Florida State's next possession, safety Glenn Earl jarred the
ball loose from Rix, with Shane Walton falling on the fumble at the
Florida State two. From there, Ryan Grant ran for the score to make
it 20-10.</TE>
<TE>   On the ensuing kickoff, Carlos Pierre-Antoine stripped the ball
from Leon Washington with Brandon Hoyte recovering at the Florida
State 17.</TE>
<TE>   That led to a 16-yard touchdown pass from Holiday to Omar Jenkins,
who beat defender B.J. Dean on a corner-post pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Before Bobby Bowden could blink, a 10-10 game was suddenly 27-10,
and the Florida State coach was completely, well, bumfuzzled.</TE>
<TE>   You heard it right.</TE>
<TE>   "They kept us bumfuzzled all day with their alignments and
things," Bowden said.</TE>
<TE>   With Notre Dame, you can't chalk things up to luck anymore because
the Irish are doing this to teams every week.</TE>
<TE>   "So, just count us in the club," Bowden said. "They're serial
killers. They kill everybody the same way. No change."</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Florida State officials distributed a brief
statement with Bowden's apology.</TE>
<TE>   "I used an analogy I should not have said, especially in the wake
of recent events," Bowden said. "I certainly meant no disrespect."</TE>
<TE>   Five of Notre Dame's victories this season have come by margins of
eight points or fewer and most have turned on a staggering sequence
of plays.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish scored two touchdowns in an 11-second span in an
early-season victory over Purdue and scored four touchdowns in 6:54
against Stanford to turn a 7-3 deficit into a 31-7 rout.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like the word 'opportunistic,' because we practice those
things," Irish defensive coordinator Kent Baer explained. "I think
it's a sign of a good football team."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's final score did not do Notre Dame justice. The Irish
dominated play from intermission to the final gun, extending its lead
to 34-10 with 11:05 to play on Grant's 31-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   The Seminoles scored two meaningless touchdowns in the final
minutes to make it a 10-point game, but only after Bowden had pulled
Rix and replaced him with Adrian McPherson. It was a move that, in
Tallahassee, will only result in a quarterback controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State (5-3) has now lost home games in consecutive seasons
for the first time since 1986-87.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham, as usual, discussed the win with all the emotion of a
secretary reading minutes at a board meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I have mixed emotions about our team right now," he said. "I
think we did some great things today and we are very fortunate to win
against another very, very good football team, but there are some
things we need to clean up a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   The only thing the Irish need to clean up is their acceptance
speech to a bowl championship series game. Notre Dame is two wins
(Navy and Rutgers) from clinching a BCS berth, but things may get
even more interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame, No. 3 in the first BCS standings, might jump ahead of
Miami on Monday for the coveted second spot. This would be
interesting in that Miami is defending national champion, has won 29
consecutive games and has been ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press
poll for a record 20 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   But what about Notre Dame right now is not interesting?</TE>

<HD>Goalie Dilemma Solved With Care</HD>

<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Andy Murray listened to his heart.</LD>
<LD>   This was the dilemma facing the King coach: For Friday night's
game against the New York Rangers, should he go with No. 1 goaltender
Felix Potvin, whose 1-6 record against the Rangers was his worst
against any opponent? Or should he call on backup Jamie Storr, whose
blanking of the Rangers in January was the Kings' first shutout in
nearly 60 games at Madison Square Garden?</LD>
<LD>   Murray seemed to be leaning toward Storr, whom he wants to get
into more games this season, but then he learned that Potvin's
parents, Pierre and Bruna, had made the drive from Montreal to watch
their son play.</LD>
<TE>   Murray made the sentimental choice in going with Potvin, who
benefited from an offensive outburst by the Kings in a 6-2 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "You can say that kind of stuff doesn't matter," the coach said,
"but if you want to have a relationship with your players, you'd
better try to consider it when you can."</TE>
<TE>   Murray added, "Before people care how much you know, they want to
know how much you care."</TE>
<TE>   Storr, he said, will play today against the Columbus Blue Jackets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ziggy Palffy, who has sat out four of the last five games because
of a strained left groin, did not practice Saturday and is listed as
day to day. Jason Allison, who suffered a strained right wrist in
Friday's game, also sat out, but he is expected to play today.</TE>

lead Friday night in a 5-4 loss to the San Jose Sharks.</TE>

<LD>Rick Fox did not practice Saturday, and the NBA did not issue its
sanctions for Friday night's fights, and so the Lakers and Sacramento
Kings stood about where they did when Fox and Doug Christie were
pulled apart, each defiant and disgusted.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers figure on a suspension for Fox, who fought Christie
twice during Friday's exhibition game, once on the court and again
after running 100 feet or so through a hallway, past a handful of
security guards. They also fear a short suspension for Shaquille
O'Neal, who left the bench to defend an outnumbered Fox in the far
tunnel at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Christie, who during the first altercation threw a closed-fisted
punch that connected with Fox's chin, also would seem to be destined
for a suspension, as would many of his teammates, who left the bench
area when the second fight began.</LD>
<TE>   According to the NBA rule book, during an altercation "all players
not participating in the game must remain in the vicinity of the
bench. Violators will be suspended, without pay, for a minimum of one
game."</TE>
<TE>   The league would stagger those suspensions for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   A league spokesman said Saturday that Stu Jackson, NBA vice
president of operations, would rule today at the earliest after
reviewing tape and referees' accounts of the incidents. Fox, the
Lakers' starting small forward in all three championship seasons,
could be out five games or more and be fined a substantial sum (not
exceeding $35,000, according to NBA guidelines), and the other
suspensions should lessen from there.</TE>
<TE>   And so the final weekend of Laker training camp was spent mulling
the fall-out of a Pacific Division rivalry turned violent and what it
meant in the short term for a Laker team already without O'Neal for
perhaps the first few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming his ailing lower back is sound, fourth-year player Devean
George presumably would start Tuesday, opening night, in place of
Fox. Tracy Murray, who shot well late in camp and appears to be
recovered from April hip surgery, would get most of the reserve
minutes at small forward. Swingman Kobe Bryant, who has always
preferred small forward to shooting guard, could also play there.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson ordered Fox to take Saturday and, perhaps,
today off.</TE>
<TE>   "To get his mind straight," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Though he called for suspensions for involved King players and
granted that Fox and O'Neal should be similarly accountable, Jackson
declined to address Fox's actions.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to muddy the water around the situation by giving
the league something to work with and saying something I'd regret
because I don't know all the details of the situation," he said.
"Obviously I don't condone fighting and that's very important that
our players understand that and that the fans understand that as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "These players are too big to be fighting. It's not a game that's
enhanced by fighting."</TE>

<HD>Dorsey Rides to the Rescue for No. 1 Miami</HD>
<DH>He passes for career-high 422 yards and breaks three school
records in 40-23 victory over West Virginia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MORGANTOWN, W.Va.</DL>
<LD>Miami's run defense had yet another poor showing, so Ken Dorsey came
to the rescue with his best game ever.</LD>
<LD>   Dorsey threw for a career-high 422 yards and two touchdowns as
top-ranked Miami defeated stubborn West Virginia, 40-23, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   He set school career records for completions (564), yards passing
(8,024) and total offense (7,981), all previously held by Gino
Torretta, who played in 1989-92.</LD>
<TE>   Except for two career categories, Dorsey now has surpassed Heisman
Trophy winners Torretta and Vinny Testaverde, along with Bernie
Kosar, Craig Erickson and Steve Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   "Ken has been so steady and so good that you sometimes take him
for granted as a football coach," Miami Coach Larry Coker said.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes (7-0 overall, 3-0 in the Big East Conference)
pulled away from a 17-17 third-quarter tie to extend the nation's
longest winning streak to 29 games, which equaled the school record
set from 1990 to '92.</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia (5-3, 2-1) stayed in the game because it was able to
run on the Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   Just like two weeks ago against Florida State, Miami's run defense
was pummeled. This time it was Avon Cobourne, backup Quincy Wilson
and quarterback Rasheed Marshall doing the damage, as the Hurricanes
allowed a season-high 363 yards on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   It was the most allowed by Miami since Syracuse had 318 yards
rushing in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Every team is going to try to rush on us," Miami defensive end
Andrew Williams said. "Other teams will get 300 yards also if they
don't pass."</TE>
<TE>   Cobourne, the nation's third-leading rusher, had 26 carries for
175 yards, his sixth 100-yard effort of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Hurricanes were held to a season-low 102 yards
rushing, Willis McGahee showed he was healed from a turf toe injury
with 112 yards and three short scores.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey overcame a sluggish first half to complete 22 of 36 passes.
His previous high for yards was 362 against Nebraska in the Rose Bowl
last January and against Florida State two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Gino can't give me a hard time after today," Dorsey said with a
smile.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey, who is 33-1 as a starter, also is within one touchdown
pass of tying the Big East mark of 77 set by Syracuse's Donovan
McNabb from 1995-98.</TE>

<HD>Horne Leads Nebraska to Road Win</HD>

<DL>COLLEGE STATION, Texas</DL>
<LD>Freshman David Horne scored three of his four touchdowns in the
second half as Nebraska finally won on the road, defeating Texas A&amp;M,
38-31, Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   The Cornhuskers (6-3, 2-2 in Big 12) rallied from a 17-point
third-quarter deficit to end a five-game road losing streak, their
longest since 1958.</LD>
<LD>   They were on the verge of making it six in a row when Byron Jones
returned a fumble by Jammal Lord 66 yards for a touchdown and a 31-14
Texas A&amp;M lead midway through the third quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Then the Aggies (5-3, 2-2) gave up 24 consecutive points -- on
Horne's touchdown runs of 21, 11 and six yards, and a 42-yard field
goal by Josh Brown. Horne's go-ahead six-yarder came with 11:01 to
play.</TE>
<TE>   The Aggies hadn't allowed a 100-yard individual rushing
performance since the 2000 season, and the Cornhuskers had two
100-yard performances.</TE>
<TE>   Lord ran 159 yards in 30 carries, and Horne finished with 128
yards in 24 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Texas A&amp;M blew a big lead at home for their second game in a row.
The Aggies led Texas Tech, 35-17, in the fourth quarter Oct. 5 but
lost, 48-47, in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Horne's 11-yard touchdown came early in the fourth quarter, and
the Cornhuskers' drive was kept alive when fullback Judd Davies ran
for a first down on fourth and one at the Nebraska 28.</TE>

<HD>Huston Shoots a 61, Ties Herron for Buick Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The golf course at Pine Mountain, Ga., was playing so easy that John
Huston tried to make birdies on every hole. He wound up with a share
of the lead in the Buick Challenge, and almost in the record books.</LD>
<LD>   Despite missing two birdie putts inside five feet, a six-foot
birdie putt and a 12-foot eagle putt, Huston still matched his best
score on the PGA Tour with an 11-under-par 61 on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   That left him tied with Tim Herron going into the final round,
each at 20-under 196, setting the 54-hole record in the event.
Huston's 61 was one stroke off the course record by Steve Lowery in
1997.</LD>
<TE>   "You just can't let up," Huston said. "I was trying to keep the
pedal to the metal and keep going, knowing that everyone else was
playing under easy conditions."</TE>
<TE>   How easy?</TE>
<TE>   Huston and Herron (65) were among a dozen players who shot 65 or
better on the soggy Mountain View course at Callaway Gardens. The
average score on a damp, overcast day was 68.2, the lowest it has
been all week.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I've just shot par," Craig Parry said after his 66,
which left him one stroke out of the lead at 197 with David Toms, who
shot a 63.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Watson holed a 132-yard shot for eagle and needed only 23
putts to take a share of the third-round lead in the season-ending
Senior Tour Championship at Oklahoma City.</TE>
<TE>   Watson finished with a six-under 66 to tie Gil Morgan (69) at
nine-under 207.</TE>
<TE>   Second-round leader Hale Irwin was at 210 after a 73. He needs to
finish fourth or better to become the first senior player to earn $3

<LD>**** Makings of a classic</LD>
<LD>   *** Smash-mouth football</LD>
<LD>   ** Good for an end around</LD>
<TE>   * Strictly fantasy fodder</TE>
<TE>   ** Seattle (1-5) at Dallas (3-4), 10 a.m.: Cowboys don't play at
home again until Nov. 24, so if Emmitt Smith wants to break Walter
Payton's record at Texas Stadium, he had better step up. LINE: Dallas
by 2  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Detroit (2-4) at Buffalo (4-3), 10 a.m.: Both teams have
matched (Lions) or surpassed (Bills) their victory totals from last
season. So much for incentive. LINE: Buffalo by 7  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Cleveland (3-4) at New York Jets (2-4), 10 a.m.: Victories by
both teams last week momentarily lifted the doom and gloom from their
seasons, but what will become of the loser after today? LINE: New
York by 3.</TE>
<TE>   *** Oakland (4-2) at Kansas City (3-4), 10 a.m., Channel 2, KMPC
(1540): Raiders averaging 434 yards per game and almost 33 points.
Chiefs averaging 390 yards and 34.1 points. Raider defense is
beleaguered. Chief defense is porous. What does this all mean? Look
for a 10-7 game. LINE: Oakland by 2  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Tampa Bay (5-2) at Carolina (3-4), 10 a.m.: Randy Fasani better
put that Stanford education to use and devise a plan to keep himself
from being humiliated by the Buccaneers' No. 1 defense in his first
start at quarterback. LINE: Tampa Bay by 7.</TE>
<TE>   *** Atlanta (3-3) at New Orleans (6-1), 10 a.m., Channel 11:
Cousins Michael Vick and Aaron Brooks face one another for the first
time. Vick already has sent a message by winning -- on the road, no
less -- the all-important ticket request matchup, 25-20. LINE: New
Orleans by 4.</TE>
<TE>   * Tennessee (2-4) at Cincinnati (0-6), 10 a.m.: The last time the
Bengals started a season 0-6, the next time out Corey Dillon rushed
for an NFL-record 278 yards in a 31-21 win against Denver. LINE:
Tennessee by 5  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Chicago (2-4) at Minnesota (1-5), 10 a.m., KNX (1070): How's
this for motivation: Viking Coach Mike Tice whips out obscure
positive statistics to keep his young team from losing hope, then
says, "Unfortunately, stats are for losers." Huh? LINE: Minnesota by
1.</TE>
<TE>   *** Pittsburgh (3-3) at Baltimore (3-3), 10 a.m.: "It's going to
be a bad-blood type game," Steeler receiver Plaxico Burress says.
"There's bad blood between us, regardless," Raven linebacker Ray
Lewis says. What else is there to say? LINE: Pittsburgh by 2.</TE>
<TE>   *** Arizona (4-2) at San Francisco (4-2), 1 p.m.: Cardinals have
been flying under the radar all season and they get another chance
today since the baseball Giants are the talk of San Francisco and no
doubt will remain the focus through the weekend. LINE: San Francisco
by 8.</TE>
<TE>   *** Denver (5-2) at New England (3-3), 1:15 p.m., Channel 2: From
the getting-a-little-ahead-of-yourself dept.: Bronco receiver Rod
Smith says, "This is a playoff game for us.... We have everything
stacked against us." Someone remind him the calendar hasn't even
reached Halloween yet. LINE: New England by 3.</TE>
<TE>   * Houston (1-5) at Jacksonville (3-3), 1:15 p.m.: Texans must
avoid the temptation of looking ahead to next week, however enticing
that might be. Bengals come to town. LINE: Jacksonville by 10  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Indianapolis (4-2) at Washington (2-4), 5:30 p.m., ESPN, XTRA
(690), KLSX-FM (97.1): Redskins lose last week and Steve Spurrier
responds with another series of lineup changes. Colts lose and Tony
Dungy keeps everything the same. Hmm, wonder whom the players respect
more? LINE: Pick.</TE>
<TE>   *** New York Giants (3-3) at Philadelphia (4-2), Monday, 6 p.m.,
Channel 7, KNX (1070): Eagles know division race goes through the
Giants, but consider these numbers: Under Jim Fassel, Giants are
3-9-1 in prime-time games and 1-5 on Monday night. Eagles are 6-0 at
night under Andy Reid, including 2-0 on Monday. LINE: Philadelphia by
7.</TE>
<TE>   Open date: Miami, San Diego, Green Bay, St. Louis.</TE>

<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It isn't much of a choice to begin with, and it isn't his alone to
make, but it's the only choice Emmitt Smith has.</LD>
<LD>   Does he do it in Dallas, or does he do it in Detroit?</LD>
<LD>   Does Smith do whatever it takes -- 40 carries, 50 carries, direct
snaps from center? -- to get the last 93 yards he needs to finally
break Walter Payton's career rushing record today, at Texas Stadium,
in front of the home crowd?</LD>
<TE>   Or does Smith stick to the turtle's pace he has maintained since
2000 -- he's averaging 63.8 yards a game in his last 23 games -- and
drag it out one week longer, taking the interminable circus on the
road, to Detroit, one-time home of the man who should have broken
Payton's record in 1999, Barry Sanders?</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Dallas: Smith will have done something -- gained
as many as 93 yards in a single game -- that he hasn't done since
last December.</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Detroit: Smith will have done something --
brought Sanders to a Lion game -- that hasn't been done since 1998.
Or then again, maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Dallas: The national NFL writers assigned to
chronicle Smith's jog to history can finally get on with their lives.</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Detroit: The national NFL writers will have to
waste one more week on an otherwise meaningless game in Michigan when
they could have been covering San Francisco at Oakland or Tom Brady
at Drew Bledsoe.</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Dallas: The Cowboys can at last get on with the
future of the franchise -- i.e., giving the ball to Troy Hambrick.</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Detroit: Hambrick bides his time another week and
the long-stalled Cowboy rebuilding program will have burned yet
another half-season.</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Dallas: Smith will have taken advantage of a
can't-miss opportunity -- four quarters against Seattle's
league-worst rushing defense, which is yielding an average of 190
yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Detroit: Smith will have to grind out the final
few feet against a much tougher Lion defense, which is eighth in the
league in fewest yards allowed per carry, devout cowards and all.</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Dallas: Pat Summerall will be on hand to record
the moment for posterity, as well he should.</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Detroit: Some generic off-the-assembly-line voice
will probably call the record-breaking run, which will remind
everyone again of how badly Fox messed up when it drop-kicked
Summerall out of its No. 1 football booth.</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Dallas: The Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders will be
forced to stretch their talents and try to do something they did not
know was in their job description: cheer. It's always inspiring to
see horizons expanded.</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Detroit: The Lions, if they can get the word out
in time, might peddle enough tickets to almost sell out a home game.</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Dallas: The Dallas Morning News can ratchet down
the Emmitt watch coverage, which would be the environmentally correct
thing to do, as well as the journalistically correct thing, allowing
its staff to refocus on the sport that matters in Dallas, pro
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   If he does it in Detroit: Smith will have to live with his
conscience, knowing he was partly responsible for the Morning News'
cold-blooded slaughter of another forest.</TE>
<TE>   Do it today, Emmitt.</TE>
<TE>   Get the ball, get it done, get the record, get it out of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Save a tree.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He's Number ... 8?</TE>
<TE>   Once he logs his 16,727th yard, Smith will rank first in NFL yards
rushing, which is quite different from being ranked first among NFL
running backs.</TE>
<TE>   In a special-edition magazine commemorating the final leg of
Smith's pursuit, the Sporting News ranks the top 50 running backs of
all time. Smith barely cracks the top 10, placing eighth, just ahead
of Eric Dickerson and Bronko Nagurski.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, he is the top-ranked Cowboy running back,
finishing five slots ahead of Tony Dorsett.</TE>
<TE>   On the down side, he's only No. 2 in Texas, placing three notches
behind the old Houston Oiler, Earl Campbell.</TE>
<TE>   A top-seven certain to stir it up in saloons around the Metroplex:</TE>
<TE>   1. JIM BROWN</TE>
<TE>   Why? He's an NFL icon, he played during pro football's so-fancied
"golden era," and he fulfilled the ever-popular sportswriter and fan
fantasy by going out on top. Played only nine seasons, led the league
in rushing in eight, averaged more than 100 yards a game. He's the
NFL equivalent of Babe Ruth, so it's good he gets his here. He
retired in 1965, meaning he won't stand a chance when MasterCard gets
around to an NFL greatest-moments poll.</TE>
<TE>   2. WALTER PAYTON</TE>
<TE>   Why? He held the career rushing record for 15 years, the
single-game record for 23 and gained most of his yards while playing
for some very bad Chicago Bear teams. He also passed for eight
touchdowns in 34 attempts. Yes, the Bears used to throw deep, once
upon a time.</TE>
<TE>   3. BARRY SANDERS</TE>
<TE>   Why? He was zeroing in on Payton's record when he abruptly
retired, shortly after turning 30, shortly before the 1999 season.
Probably would have had it with one more full season; he was fewer
than 1,500 yards away. When he stepped away to try to force a trade
that never came, he opened the door for Smith.</TE>
<TE>   4. GALE SAYERS</TE>
<TE>   Why? At 34, a year older than Smith is now, he was inducted into
the Hall of Fame. Scored a record-tying six touchdowns in one game,
averaged five yards a carry in his career, but knee injuries limited
him to four full seasons and fractions of three others. In this poll,
evidently, it's better to burn out than it is to rust.</TE>
<TE>   5. EARL CAMPBELL</TE>
<TE>   Why? Remember that hit he put on Ram linebacker Isiah Robertson?
Robertson never forgot it, and neither will ESPN Classic. Four
monstrous seasons -- netted 1,934 yards in 1980 -- before the
pounding, given and absorbed, caught up with him.</TE>
<TE>   6. O.J. SIMPSON</TE>
<TE>   Why? The NFL's first 2,000-yard man and the only reason to watch
the Buffalo Bills in the '70s. Was once as good as they get, but the
tumble was steep and tragic.</TE>
<TE>   7. MARION MOTLEY</TE>
<TE>   Why? Raised in Canton, Ohio, and eventually enshrined there as
well. One of the first black athletes to play professional football,
he endured much of the same racist resistance that confronted Jackie
Robinson. Overcame it to lead the old All-America Football Conference
in career rushing, then averaged five yards a carry in five NFL
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   But that's only one magazine's opinion. This week or next, Smith
will have his record, and no one can take that away from him. Give or
take another five good years by Marshall Faulk.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Nikolai Khabibulin getting a night off in goal, the New Jersey
Devils had no problem knocking the Tampa Bay Lightning from the
unbeaten ranks.</LD>
<LD>   John Madden scored twice and set up another as the goal-starved
Devils had their biggest offensive effort this season in beating the
surprising Lightning, 5-1, Saturday night at East Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   "They're a team you have to respect," Devil Coach Pat Burns said.
"Four of the last five games they came back to win or tie. We had to
worry about them for 60 minutes."</LD>
<TE>   Playing in a regular-season game for the first time since an 8-0
loss to San Jose on Feb. 8, 2000, goalie Kevin Hodson had little help
as the Devils outshot Tampa Bay, 13-5, in taking a 2-0 first-period
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Brodeur gave up a third-period goal by Chris Dingman in
recording his league-best sixth victory.</TE>
<TE>   The loss ended Tampa Bay's franchise record eight-game unbeaten
streak, which included the last game last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 3, Detroit 1 -- Andreas Johansson had two goals and an
assist at Nashville, and the Predators won their first game this
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 4, Toronto 3 -- Pavel Bure scored with 57 seconds
left at Toronto and Mike Richter made 36 saves, and the Rangers ended
a five-game winless streak.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Ottawa 3 -- Jeff Hackett made 45 saves and remained
undefeated in three starts, and Yanic Perreault scored twice for host
Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Carolina 3 -- Boris Mironov scored with 12:28 left in
the third period to cap the Blackhawks' two-goal rally at Raleigh,
N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago's Phil Houston scored the 334th goal of his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Atlanta 3 -- Brian Rolston scored his second goal of the
third period on a power play with 25.3 seconds remaining at Boston,

<DH>Dallas' Smith, one of league's most respected men, is
poised to break NFL rushing record</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Imagine the luck. Isaiah Kacyvenski, a Harvard-educated linebacker
for the Seattle Seahawks and a self-styled pro football historian, is
getting a chance to guest-star on his favorite TV show.</LD>
<LD>   ESPN Classic, here he comes.</LD>
<LD>   Kacyvenski and the rest of the Seahawk defense, which ranks last
against the run, are all that stand between Dallas running back
Emmitt Smith and the NFL's all-time rushing mark. Smith needs 93
yards to break Walter Payton's 15-year-old record, and wants to do so
in Dallas today, before the Cowboys hit the road for games at Detroit
and Indianapolis.</LD>
<TE>   "I love football, I love knowing everything about it," Kacyvenski
said. "But I don't give a ... about that record. I just want to come
out of there with a win. But obviously, I don't want him getting it
on us."</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks might not have much say in the matter. Today, they
are the Washington Generals to the Dallas Globetrotters. Assuming
that Smith will break the record, the Cowboys have planned an
on-field ceremony 30 minutes after the game. Before that, when Smith
surpasses Payton's career mark of 16,726 yards, officials will stop
the game and Smith's wife and family will greet him on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "In the ideal situation, in the ideal world, you want everything
to happen in front of your home crowd and the fans so they can all
enjoy the exciting moment," Smith said. "When I look at it and the
great opportunity it is for me, obviously I would like to have it
right here in Texas Stadium."</TE>
<TE>   For Seahawk defensive tackle Chad Eaton, it's hard not to get
caught up in the moment. Eaton jokes he might keep a pen in his sock
-- remember, Seattle's defense also was victimized by that indignity
-- so he can be the first to get Smith's autograph.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Emmitt freakin' Smith," Eaton said. "I might actually bring
a Dallas helmet and have him sign it for me. Might want to have that
in the trophy room."</TE>
<TE>   Eaton, a former New England Patriot who has faced Smith three
times in six seasons, enjoys playing against him because "he's just
so interesting to tackle."</TE>
<TE>   "After a play that goes for no gain, he'll say stuff like, 'Why
are they calling this play?' and shake his head," he said. "One time,
he looked up at the coordinator and was like, 'You're killing me down
here. Just killing me.'</TE>
<TE>   "I love playing him, I guess, because I have so much respect for
him. How are you going to intimidate Emmitt Smith? All you can say
is, 'Hey, man, I used to watch you when I was a little kid.' "</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say the Seahawks are ready to roll over. They are
1-5, and, although the playoffs are all but out of reach, they're
playing for Coach Mike Holmgren's job. It's his worst start in 11
seasons as an NFL head coach. In a loss to St. Louis last Sunday, the
Seahawks gave up 183 yards and three rushing touchdowns to Marshall
Faulk. On the Monday night before, 49er receiver Terrell Owens
autographed the ball he'd just caught for a touchdown while walking
through the end zone, embarrassing Seattle's defense -- and, some
say, himself -- in a nationally televised celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all ticked off," Kacyvenski said of the last two games.
"All that stuff has done is fuel the fire. All the talking needs to
stop. We just need to stop somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Holmgren coached Smith in the Pro Bowl after the 1990 season and,
when he was coaching the Green Bay Packers, frequently drew up
schemes to try to stop him.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, a guy like Emmitt Smith is what the league is all about,"
Holmgren said. "He's a class act. This is quite an accomplishment.
When it happens, it's really something."</TE>
<TE>   This could be Smith's last season as a Cowboy. Next season, he
will be a 34-year-old back who counts $10 million against the salary
cap. He's coming off his least productive season -- 1,021 yards --
since his rookie year, and he needed 331 yards in the final three
games to get there. His three touchdowns last season were the fewest
of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, his understudy started to creep into the spotlight.
Troy Hambrick rushed for 579 yards at an average of 5.1 yards a pop,
third-best in the league among running backs with 100 carries or
more, and established himself as the team's back of the future.</TE>
<TE>   Smith has inched toward immortality this season, rushing for a
season-high 82 yards in 22 carries in a 9-6 overtime loss at Arizona
last Sunday. So reaching the record today will mean a season-best
effort, but that's more likely considering the Cowboys are starting
rookie quarterback Chad Hutchinson, a former pro baseball player who
hasn't taken a snap in a game in five years. Establishing a running
game will be especially important.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith says he has no plans to ask Coach Dave Campo or
offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet for extra carries.</TE>
<TE>   "Trust me, these individuals know what's going down," Smith said.
"They know what's happening. They are going to do, first and
foremost, what's important to help this team win the game, then they
are going to do whatever they can within their power to do what they
need to help."</TE>
<TE>   And, if Smith gets the record, the Seahawks will be there for
posterity on ESPN Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Kacyvenski's solution?</TE>
<TE>   "I'd probably change the channel."</TE>

<HD>A Bowling Green Sighting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fine folks in Bowling Green, Ohio, didn't think it could get any
better than last season, when permanent lights were installed and
night football debuted at Perry Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Attendance doubled, tailgating took on a whole new meaning in the
sleepy northern Ohio town and the beloved Falcons responded with an
8-3 season, including a sizzling 56-21 victory over in-state rival
Toledo.</LD>
<LD>   But this year, there has been more excitement than huggable
mascots Frieda and Freddie Falcon could possibly handle. Bowling
Green, ranked No. 24, owns the nation's highest-scoring offense at
almost 48 points a game and rolled to another Mid-American Conference
victory Saturday against Ball State, 38-20.</LD>
<TE>   The lowest-ranked undefeated team in the nation, the Falcons (7-0)
even had Ball State Coach Bill Lynch gushing afterward: "I've got to
admit, they're the real deal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pollsters, however, might not feel the same. They've seen this
type of hype before.Tulane went 12-0 in 1998 ... and was ranked No. 7
in the final Associated Press poll, done in by a flimsy schedule.
Auburn went 11-0 in 1993 ... and finished No. 4, largely because the
Tigers were ineligible for a bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech went 11-0-1 in 1990 and Syracuse went 11-0-1 in 1987,
but both finished No. 2 because of respective ties with North
Carolina and Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Paterno is still crying over the fact that Penn State's 11-0
record in 1968 and 1969 was only good enough for No. 2 ... twice.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Toledo might be the most disrespected school of all time,
going 12-0 in 1970 and 1971, but finishing No. 12 and No. 14 in the
final AP polls.</TE>
<TE>   And before Bowling Green fans start gathering signatures for a BCS
petition, they should remember that four of the Falcons' final five
games are on the road, including the regular-season finale against
Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   Looking long-term, it will be difficult to hang on to Coach Urban
Meyer, a former wide receivers coach at Notre Dame who needed just
two years to get Bowling Green into the top 25.</TE>
<TE>   But hey, if the Falcons emerge unscathed from their final five
games, they're bowl-bound. After all, it's a painless 80-mile trip to
the Motor City Bowl in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cranky Call</TE>
<TE>   It's a good bet the weekly Big 12 coaches' teleconference with
reporters will have less finger-wagging and admonishing during Texas
Tech's 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Leach chastised media members last Monday for not
including Red Raider quarterback Kliff Kingsbury among the Heisman
hopefuls, calling reporters across the nation "irresponsible."</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a quarterback in the country that has better numbers
than Kliff ... period," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There were plenty of quarterbacks with better stats Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Kingsbury had a career-high four interceptions and no touchdowns
as Texas Tech was pummeled by No. 21 Colorado, 37-13.</TE>
<TE>   Making matters worse, Kingsbury, who entered as the nation's
leader in touchdown passes and yards passing, had an interception and
a fumble returned for touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a total collapse on offense, a total collapse on special
teams ... " said Leach, who did not allow the media to talk to his
offensive players after the game. "Anybody on offense and special
teams should be ashamed of themselves."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No Posting Up for J-Lo</TE>
<TE>   If goal posts had feelings, the ones at Kentucky's Commonwealth
Stadium would be sending thank-you notes and gift baskets to
ample-girthed quarterback Jared Lorenzen.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzen, who goes by several monikers -- The Hefty Lefty, The
Round Mound of Touchdown and The Pillsbury Throw Boy, among others --
said he wanted to sit atop the goalposts if Kentucky defeated
Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzen, who admits to being "a few M&amp;Ms shy of 300 [pounds],"
has been plotting it since last season, when he said he would help
fans tear down the goalposts if Kentucky upset Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   The upset bid fell short against Tennessee, but Lorenzen told the
Louisville Courier-Journal last week he was again ready to party with
the posts.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're lucky enough to win, I'll be sitting right on top of the
goalposts," Lorenzen said.</TE>
<TE>   Not wanting to be left out, Kentucky Coach Guy Morriss said he'd
get in on the act, too.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd shimmy right up there with him, and I'd gladly pay for a new
set," Morriss said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Kentucky hasn't beaten a top 10 team since 1977.</TE>
<TE>   And of course, Kentucky got smeared by No. 5 Georgia, 52-24, which
played without three starters on offense because of injuries and
still set a school record with six touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adversity? Where?</TE>
<TE>   Let's count the reasons why Auburn had no need to show for its
game against Louisiana State.</TE>
<TE>   * Running back Carnell "Cadillac" Williams was declared done for
the season last week because of a broken leg.</TE>
<TE>   * Auburn wasn't able to videotape its practices Tuesday or
Wednesday because President Bush visited campus and the Secret
Service did not want anybody in the coaching towers for security
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   * No. 10 Louisiana State was riding a six-game win streak with
three Southeastern Conference victories by a combined 72 points.</TE>
<TE>   So what happened? Ronnie Brown ran for 95 yards and two touchdowns
in place of Williams, and Auburn harassed Louisiana State quarterback
Marcus Randall into four interceptions during a 31-7 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the best effort since I've been here, on both sides of the
ball," said fourth-year Coach Tommy Tuberville.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coaching Economics 101</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska stormed back to defeat Texas A&amp;M, 38-31, and increased
the job security of besieged Coach Frank Solich, particularly after
it was unearthed last week that if Nebraska fires Solich, it will
cost the school about two million dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a complete collapse (i.e., a loss at home against Kansas
on Nov. 9), Solich probably will be around for at least a couple more
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The economic news is better in Florida, where first-year Coach Ron
Zook will save the Gators $407,000 in contract incentives by
underachieving.</TE>
<TE>   Among the clauses not likely to be triggered in Zook's deal:
$150,000 for reaching the Fiesta Bowl; $50,000 for winning AP coach
of the year, $50,000 for finishing in the top 10 of the final AP
poll; $37,000 for reaching the SEC title game; and $25,000 for
winning SEC coach of the year.</TE>

<HD>Ohio State's Gamble Pays Off</HD>
<DH>As school's first two-way starter since 1963, he makes key
plays in 13-7 victory over Penn State. Clarett is injured early.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Chris Gamble began the game as Ohio State's first two-way starter in
39 years. He left with the record crowd chanting his name.</LD>
<LD>   On a day when freshman running back Maurice Clarett missed most of
the game because of a shoulder injury, Gamble's performance was
something to shout about.</LD>
<LD>   The wide receiver made a stellar debut as a starting defensive
back by returning an interception for a touchdown and preventing a
score with a tackle in No. 4 Ohio State's 13-7 victory over No. 18
Penn State on Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "It feels good to get my name chanted by the crowd," the
soft-spoken Gamble said after he was hailed by 105,103 at Ohio
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The victory helped the Buckeyes (9-0, 4-0) stay on course for the
Big Ten Conference title. They don't play Iowa (8-1, 5-0) this
season, but they have the inside track to the Rose Bowl, since they
have a better overall record.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the best team we've played. It'd be close between them
and Iowa," said Penn State Coach Joe Paterno, whose team lost in
overtime to the Hawkeyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Do they play Iowa? That would be a pretty good game."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed it would. And if Penn State could have knocked off the
Buckeyes, Iowa would have a clear path to Pasadena. But the Nittany
Lions (5-3, 2-3) managed only five first downs and 179 total yards.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett, who missed a game earlier this season because of a knee
injury, hurt his left shoulder six plays into the game and did not
return. He had been averaging 140 yards a game and was off to another
fast start Saturday, gaining 39 yards in four carries to give him
1,019 yards in just over seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State Coach Jim Tressel said he was unsure of the nature or
the severity of the injury.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you if it's a one-day thing or a five-day thing," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gamble picked up the slack by becoming the first Ohio State player
since Paul Warfield in 1963 to start on both sides of the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Before Saturday, he had played only five snaps on defense, with
two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   With Ohio State trailing, 7-3, early in the third quarter, Gamble
picked off an underthrown floater by quarterback Zack Mills. Gamble
raced down the right sideline, cut to the inside briefly and then
sidestepped a tackler to slide into the end zone for a 40-yard score.</TE>
<TE>   Gamble's other huge play came during the turnover-plagued first
half.</TE>
<TE>   On third and goal from the Penn State five-yard line, Buckeye
quarterback Craig Krenzel fumbled while trying to get the ball across
the goal line. Anwar Phillips scooped up the ball at the one and
raced 58 yards before Gamble brought him down.</TE>

<LD>Jason Gesser became Washington State's all-time leader in total
offense, and the ninth-ranked Cougars came back in the second half to
beat Arizona, 21-13, Saturday night at Tucson.</LD>
<LD>   Gesser completed 20 of 36 passes for 275 yards, including a
16-yard touchdown throw to Devard Darling to put the Cougars ahead,
14-13, with 2:04 left in the third quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Jermaine Green rushed for 119 yards in 29 carries. His
tackle-breaking, 18-yard touchdown run with 7:37 remaining gave
Washington State its final points.</LD>
<TE>   The game ended with the Cougars on the Wildcats' three.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State (7-1, 4-0 in conference), which has trailed in
five of its victories, plays conference co-leader Arizona State on
Saturday at home.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser broke Jack Thompson's school record for total offense and
moved past Drew Bledsoe and Ryan Leaf into second place on the
all-time passing list -- 228 yards behind Thompson's 7,818.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Gill, whose previous long field goal was 26 yards, was
successful from 47 and 42 yards for Arizona (3-5, 0-4). His
42-yarder, on a drive kept alive by two Washington State penalties on
Arizona punts, gave the Wildcats a 13-8 lead with 4:54 left in the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona quarterback Jason Johnson fumbled the ball away twice,
once for a safety and another time to set up a Washington State
touchdown. He completed 22 of 46 passes for 224 yards, including a
27-yard scoring pass to Bobby Wade, but had two passes intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars sacked Johnson seven times. Wade, the Pac-10's leading
receiver, caught nine passes for 83 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's fumble was recovered by Washington State's Isaac Brown
at the Arizona 32 midway through the fourth quarter. Three plays
later, Green shook off several tacklers on an 18-yard scoring run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State 24, California 13 -- Steven Jackson rushed for 239
yards, the most in his career, and three touchdowns at Corvallis,
Ore., helping the Beavers (5-3, 1-3) end a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson dominated the first half, scoring all three Beavers
touchdowns' to go along with 168 yards in 16 carries. Quarterback
Derek Anderson continued to struggle, going eight of 24 for 80 yards
with no touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Boller was 27 of 51 for 284 yards, moving into third place on
the Golden Bears' all-time passing list with 7,281 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Igber led a punchless California running game with 33 yards on
11 carries and a touchdown. The Bears (5-4, 2-3) had just 16 yards
rushing.</TE>
<TE>   After two lackluster three-and-out possessions to start the game,
Oregon State started to click when Anderson converted on third and
nine from his nine with a 15-yard pass to Kenny Farley.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Defensive end Terrell Suggs had four sacks and assisted on another as
No. 23 Arizona State shut down the nation's third-best passing
offense to beat Washington, 27-16, Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   The Sun Devils (7-2, 4-0 in Pacific 10) held Washington (4-4, 1-3)
without a touchdown until the final minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Suggs has 17 1/2 sacks this season.</LD>
<TE>   One week after he threw for a Pac-10-record 536 yards and four
touchdowns in a 45-42 victory at Oregon, Andrew Walter threw for 184
yards and two touchdowns for Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   Washington quarterback Cody Pickett's string of 300-yard games
ended at seven. He was limited to 210 yards, and all but 70 came in
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   He threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to Paul Arnold with 3:47 to
play, and he drove the Huskies to their final score, Chris
Singleton's one-yard run with 51 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Washington managed only a 40-yard field goal by John
Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies have lost three of four games.</TE>

<HD>Depleted Georgia Routs Kentucky</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Georgia played without three of its best players on offense, and it
was hard to tell the Bulldogs missed them.</LD>
<LD>   David Greene and D.J. Shockley combined to throw a school-record
six touchdown passes Saturday, sending the No. 5 Bulldogs to a 52-24
rout of Kentucky at Lexington, Ky.</LD>
<LD>   The Bulldogs (8-0, 5-0 in conference) produced 529 yards despite
missing leading rusher Musa Smith, second-leading receiver Fred
Gibson and offensive tackle Jon Stinchcomb. All were injured in the
previous game against Vanderbilt.</LD>
<TE>   "It made other guys step up and make big plays. This is the best
game our offense has played," said Greene, a sophomore who improved
to 7-0 as a starter in road games.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia quarterbacks had never thrown even five touchdown passes
in a game.</TE>
<TE>   Greene finished 16 for 32 for 251 yards and four touchdowns, and
Shockley went 10 of 14 for 102 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Coach Mark Richt replaced Greene with the more mobile
Shockley about every third possession.</TE>
<TE>   "It was perfect," Richt said. "I believed both players could play
and they both had great performances. I'm thankful they both played
well on the same day."</TE>
<TE>   Terrence Edwards caught five passes for 127 yards, becoming
Georgia's leader for receptions in a career. He also had three
touchdown catches.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs are trying to win their first conference title since
1982, when they started 11-0 and lost to Penn State in the Sugar
Bowl. They can clinch the Southeastern Conference East with a victory
over Florida on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We still haven't done anything," Richt said. "Our goal is the SEC
East and it's not in our hands yet."</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky (5-3, 1-3) lost to a top 10 opponent for the 40th
consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Jared Lorenzen, who had thrown for a combined 905 yards in his
previous two games against Georgia, started six for seven but
finished 13 of 27 for 208 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia beat Kentucky for the sixth time in a row, but by the
widest margin since a 40-7 victory in 1992. The previous four
meetings in Lexington were decided by an average of four points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Alabama 34, No. 16 Tennessee 14 -- Santonio Beard ran for
two touchdowns and the Crimson Tide (6-2, 3-1) took advantage of six
turnovers in a victory at Knoxville, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   The Crimson Tide (6-2, 3-1) hadn't beaten Tennessee (4-3, 1-3)
since 1994, when former Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning was a
freshman. It was a span of seven games.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Volunteers' worst home loss since 1994, when they were
beaten, 31-0, by Florida.</TE>
<TE>   All Alabama needed was a strong running game, led by Beard and
Shaud Williams. Of course, the Volunteers helped immensely with their
mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the return of quarterback Casey Clausen, who missed the
last game with a shoulder injury, could help Tennessee. Clausen was
hurt Oct. 5 against Arkansas and returned to practice last week.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee's struggles started early when Clausen fumbled a lateral
to Derrick Tinsley. Alabama's Gerald Dixon recovered it and ran 66
yards down the sideline for a touchdown with 11:23 to go in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas 48, Mississippi 28 -- Fred Talley ran for 136 yards, and
Arkansas' special teams scored twice at Fayetteville, Ark.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas (4-3, 2-3) got 24 points following Rebel turnovers,
including kickoff fumble recoveries by Lerinezo Robinson and Thomas
Crowder.</TE>
<TE>   Ole Miss quarterback Eli Manning, who completed 42 of 56 passes
for 414 yards, threw his first touchdown in an SEC game since Sept.
21 against Vanderbilt, but he also committed three turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   The Rebels (5-3, 2-2) missed an opportunity to tie Louisiana
State, which lost, 31-7, to Auburn, for the SEC West lead. Louisiana
State (6-1, 3-1) leads Auburn (5-3, 3-2) by a half-game and Ole Miss
by one game.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas took a 41-14 lead with eight minutes left in the third
quarter. Crowder tipped a bouncing kickoff away from Rebels' return
man Ronald McClendon in the end zone and scored.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vanderbilt 28, Connecticut 24 -- Jay Cutler ran for two touchdowns
and threw for another for Vanderbilt at Nashville, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   The Commodores (2-6) ended a five-game losing streak while
Connecticut (2-6) dropped its third consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Cutler scored the winning touchdown on a seven-yard run with 1:14
remaining as Vanderbilt erased two fourth-quarter deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Safety Jonathan Shaub sealed the victory with an interception with
41 seconds left.</TE>

<DL>AUBURN, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Auburn's offense made the big plays when it needed them most. The
defense dominated up front and forced five turnovers.</LD>
<LD>   Ronnie Brown ran for 95 yards and two touchdowns in place of
injured tailback Carnell Williams as Auburn defeated No. 10 Louisiana
State, 31-7, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The victory featured everything Auburn (5-3, 3-2 in Southeastern
Conference) had failed to do in its previous two games, when it gave
up 68 points in losses to Arkansas and Florida.</LD>
<TE>   Louisiana State's Domanick Davis ran 14 times for 42 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We forced them to throw the football, and we knew we needed to
take [Davis] out of the game and we did," Auburn Coach Tommy
Tuberville said. "We held him to 42 yards, and I would have never
believed that would happen going into today."</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana State (6-2, 3-1) managed only 242 yards. Quarterback
Marcus Randall had four passes intercepted -- three in his first five
passes -- and completed only nine of 20 for 79 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We turned the ball over too many times to be successful,"
Louisiana State Coach Nick Saban said.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Campbell, making his first start of the season for Auburn
since he took over for a struggling Daniel Cobb, completed seven of
11 passes for 105 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana State, which had won six consecutive games, didn't score
until the fourth quarter.</TE>

<HD>This UCLA Victory Has a Callow Ring to It</HD>
<DH>Freshman quarterback Moore is solid, new kicker Fikse has
five field goals in 28-18 win over Stanford.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who could have expected better, really?</LD>
<LD>   Confined by his coach's cautious play-calling, the freshman
quarterback from Newhall Hart High was under constant pressure,
couldn't make plays and his team frittered away an early lead and
lost.</LD>
<LD>   But the conservative coach wasn't Bob Toledo.</LD>
<TE>   The harried quarterback wasn't Matt Moore.</TE>
<TE>   And the team that let the lead slip away was not UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins, instead, followed a horrendous first five minutes with
55 stellar ones and defeated Stanford, 28-18, Saturday at the Rose
Bowl before an antsy crowd of 54,116. The moment it was clear UCLA
was a winner, fans streamed for the exits and their tailgate
televisions in time to catch the Angels' comeback in Game 6 of the
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the locker room, UCLA felt new life. The victory
ended a two-game skid and kept the Bruins (5-3, 2-2) believing they
can qualify for a bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   "We can still do some nice things," receiver Craig Bragg said.
"We're definitely shooting for a bowl game. That would be great. You
get some cool gifts and stuff."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA was in a gift-giving mood early, losing two fumbles that led
to Stanford touchdowns and allowing a bad snap on a PAT kick to turn
into a two-point conversion pass and a 15-0 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal quarterback Kyle Matter, a redshirt freshman and former
Hart teammate of Moore, completed two passes for 28 yards on a short
scoring drive that followed a muffed punt by Bruin Tyler Ebell one
minute into the game.</TE>
<TE>   And when a center snap skidded past Moore and was scooped up in
the end zone by Stanford lineman Julian Jenkins four minutes later,
it appeared UCLA was in for a long day.</TE>
<TE>   "We were worried, but we were trusting each other," cornerback
Ricky Manning said. "We stayed strong mentally and didn't even
consider the scoreboard."</TE>
<TE>   Call it mind over matter.</TE>
<TE>   And Moore over Matter.</TE>
<TE>   Thrust into action Saturday because of injuries last week to Cory
Paus and Drew Olson, the UCLA quarterback was error free. He
completed only seven of 19 passes for 142 yards, but had no
interceptions, no fumbles and is 1-0 as a starter.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo had indicated he would play it close to the vest, but he
gave his youngster more freedom than Stanford Coach Buddy Teevens
gave Matter, who started because of a shoulder injury to Chris Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo called four passes in a five-play sequence that led to the
Bruins' first touchdown early in the second quarter. Moore hit Tab
Perry on a look-in route for a 38-yard gain, then threw a lateral to
Ebell, whose long pass to tight end Mike Seidman resulted in pass
interference.</TE>
<TE>   After an incomplete pass, Moore found Seidman in the end zone from
22 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Toledo didn't hold back on the play-calling, and that
pumped me up," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   On a first-down play later in the quarter, Moore threw deep to
Perry for a 49-yard gain that led to the second of Nate Fikse's five
field goals and cut Stanford's lead to 18-13 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell took over from there, rushing for 118 of his 160 yards in
the second half and bouncing off defenders to score on an 18-yard run
that put UCLA ahead, 22-18.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Matter's day dissolved. UCLA hounded him with man
blitzes, a departure from the zone blitzes defensive coordinator Phil
Snow normally favors. Matter was sacked six times and forced to run
another nine times.</TE>
<TE>   He scrambled well, actually, but it is a credit to the Bruin
defense that Stanford's longest play of the game was a 22-yard Matter
dash. He completed only 10 of 22 passes for 75 yards and had a
fourth-quarter throw intercepted by Manning.</TE>
<TE>   Manning and the other Bruin cornerback, Matt Ware, shut down
receivers Teyo Johnson and Luke Powell.</TE>
<TE>   "The man blitzing doesn't work unless the cornerbacks can play,"
Snow said. "Manning and Ware changed the whole game."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (2-5, 1-3) gained a paltry 97 yards in the second half
and penetrated deep into Bruin territory only once on a drive that
ended with a missed field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Manning's interception led to a 23-yard field goal that extended
the lead to 25-18, and tackle Ryan Boschetti and reserve safety Kevin
Brant made a big play on Stanford's next possession, stopping
tailback Keith Carter on fourth and one from the Stanford 29 with
6:23 to play.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA took possession and Fikse, who took over kicking duties this
week, made his fifth field goal, 45 yards, with 4:25 left.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the effusive Ebell was doing the talking. And Moore was
the topic.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking with the wisdom gained from three starts and four
consecutive 100-yard rushing performances, Ebell said the quarterback
was "cool, calm and collected. He had the three C's going."</TE>
<TE>   The same could be said for Toledo, who smiled while talking to
Moore on the sideline even when his team trailed, 15-0.</TE>
<TE>   "They took advantage of some mistakes early but we didn't alter
our game plan," Toledo said. "You've got to credit the players.
Especially with a freshman quarterback in there, we might have gone
belly up. But we just kept playing."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is 4-1 when the opposing team has scored first. So falling
behind wasn't unfamiliar territory.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been down by more than that," Perry said. "We knew the
defense would play great. We knew Tyler would run great. And Moore, I
knew in the fourth quarter when he was making checks and calling
audibles that he is genuine."</TE>
<TE>   So real, in fact, that a bona fide quarterback controversy could
be brewing. Olson, who has completed nine of 15 passes in several
relief efforts, should be healthy next week.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the season Olson was chosen over Moore as
Paus' backup because he is nearly a year older and grasped the system
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Moore grabbed opportunity, however, and doesn't plan on letting
go. As the team walked through a gauntlet of fans from the buses to
the Rose Bowl before the game, Moore brought up the rear. After
Saturday, he might lead the charge.</TE>

<LD>Steve Henson's keys to the game, and how the Bruins measured up:</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Matt Moore must make enough plays to enable the Bruins
to win the field-position battle in what should be a low-scoring
game. Moore made enough big plays, throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass
to Mike Seidman and hitting Tab Perry for gains of 38 and 49 yards.</LD>
<LD>   2. A Bruin defense that had not forced any turnovers in its losses
must do so. Ricky Manning intercepted a pass that led to a field goal
and Ben Emanuel blocked a field goal. The Bruins also registered six
sacks and held Stanford to 241 yards.</LD>
<TE>   3. The UCLA offense must take advantage of red-zone opportunities,
a problem all season. The Bruins scored all five times they
penetrated inside the 20, four times on field goals and once on a
touchdown run by Tyler Ebell.</TE>

<HD>Wait Is Worth It for Fikse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nate Fikse kept waiting for his turn.</LD>
<LD>   For more than three seasons.</LD>
<LD>   When the UCLA punter finally got a chance to add kicking duties to
his job description Saturday, he made sure he made good on it.</LD>
<TE>   Fikse kicked five field goals, the most by a UCLA kicker since
Chris Sailer -- Fikse's mentor and private coach -- kicked five
against Washington in 1998. (The school record is six, set by John
Lee against San Diego State in 1984.)</TE>
<TE>   "What did he have, five field goals?" running back Tyler Ebell
said. "He did a great job."</TE>
<TE>   Watching UCLA line up for field-goal attempts has almost become
more suspenseful than Coach Bob Toledo and Bruin fans could stand
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Griffith, a senior starter who missed only three field goals
a season the last two years, already had missed six, going eight for
14 and struggling with low trajectory and blocked kicks.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo tried to stick with Griffith to bolster his confidence, but
finally said OK to Fikse's pleas for a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "They gave me a chance in the past, but Griff beat me out
throughout the years," Fikse said. "Then again, he's not having one
of his better years like he usually has. I want to help this team. I
know he does too. I just wanted to get a shot."</TE>
<TE>   He got plenty.</TE>
<TE>   Fikse's first kick was from 36 yards. Good.</TE>
<TE>   Then from 22 and 19. Good, and good again.</TE>
<TE>   Another from 23.</TE>
<TE>   And to finish the day, a 44-yarder that gave UCLA a 10-point lead
with 4 1/2 minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always good to start off short so I can get a feel for it,"
said Fikse, whose only previous field-goal attempt at UCLA was a
missed 55-yarder against Colorado this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't done it in three or four years, since high school. And
that 44-yarder was just awesome. It felt so good."</TE>
<TE>   Fikse also handled the kickoff and punting duties, averaging 43.8
yards a punt with a long of 56.</TE>
<TE>   Never did he imagine five field goals in a 28-18 victory over
Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "Toward the end of the game, I was starting to feel a little
cramping up. I just tried to stay warm and stretch," said Fikse, a
senior from Anaheim Esperanza High.</TE>
<TE>   Fikse said he feels confident kicking from as far as 45 or 50
yards. (He made a 56-yard kick in high school.)</TE>
<TE>   But he also knows where a kicker's bread is buttered.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 35 yards and in is pretty automatic -- it should be
automatic," Fikse said.</TE>
<TE>   He figures to get the call again next week at Washington, when he
and Griffith will be friendly but slightly awkward roommates on the
road.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard you know, but he's been supportive," Fikse said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been fine, and I think he'll be back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's comeback after trailing, 15-0, in the second quarter marked
the Bruins' biggest turnaround since coming back from a 21-0 deficit
to beat Arizona State, 38-31, in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA sacked Stanford quarterback Kyle Matter six times, including
two by linebacker Brandon Chillar.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Dave Ball had one, and has at least one sack in six
consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   The defensive effort was led by the starting linebackers --
Chillar, Marcus Reese and Spencer Havner -- who combined for 34
tackles.</TE>
<TE>   "We just played aggressive," Reese said. "With a freshman
quarterback, we don't have a margin for error. We've got to play like
this from now on with a young quarterback playing."</TE>

<HD>Quarterback Duel Affair of Hart</HD>
<DH>On a big day for the high school in Newhall, UCLA's Moore
and Stanford's Matter lead their teams at the Rose Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With helmets off and the game over, Matt Moore of UCLA and Kyle
Matter of Stanford hugged at the 30-yard line, finally able to rid
themselves of any pretense that they were somehow enemies just
because their uniforms were different. Deep down, these two
quarterbacks from Newhall Hart High were pulling for each other from
beginning to end on a strange day at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Add the fact that another ex-Hart quarterback, Kyle Boller, was
starting for California in Corvallis, Ore., and it was enough to
leave mutual friends in a frenzy.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA Coach Bob Toledo was happy to start an argument about which
quarterback is best after the Bruins' 28-18 victory over Stanford.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm pleased with the one we got," he said. "We took him out of
his redshirt year, and for him to do that and win this game made it
worth while. He had so much poise out there. He didn't panic at all."</TE>
<TE>   Moore, an 18-year-old freshman, completed seven of 19 passes for
142 yards and one touchdown in his college debut. He didn't throw an
interception. Not once was UCLA penalized for delay of game. "I was
pumped up," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, he was sitting at home watching UCLA's game against
California on television. This was supposed to be the year devoted to
adding weight to his 6-foot-4, 185-pound frame and running the scout
team. But starting quarterback Cory Paus broke his fibula, backup
Drew Olson injured his shoulder, and Moore was asked to step in with
just a week of practice. He had the time of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could have hit a couple more passes than I did," he
said. "I overthrew a couple balls."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Matter, a redshirt freshman, was filling in for an
injured Chris Lewis and had to face a relentless UCLA pass rush that
resulted in six sacks. He completed 10 of 22 passes for 75 yards with
one interception. Twice he broke off scrambles of 22 and 21 yards,
something he rarely did in high school when he led Hart to
consecutive Southern Section Division III championships.</TE>
<TE>   "Pressure makes everything more difficult," Matter said. "I did my
best to hang in there, but it gets to you."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford defensive players thought they had the advantage in
facing Moore in his first game. They hoped to rattle him, but he
never gave in.</TE>
<TE>   "I was amazed," Stanford defensive tackle Matt Leonard said. "He
played like a veteran. I didn't see any freshman in him. I think he
did a tremendous job and is probably going to be a big asset for them
in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo simplified UCLA's game plan trying to make sure the offense
didn't require Moore to carry the team to victory. Tyler Ebell helped
out with 160 yards rushing.</TE>
<TE>   But Toledo didn't shy away from calling passes in difficult
situations. Moore showed his arm strength on a 49-yard pass to Tab
Perry.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the two former teammates tried to explain their
emotions. "It was a little weird," Moore said. "The last time I
talked to him on a football field we were teammates."</TE>
<TE>   Added Matter: "It was a strange feeling, but I'm happy he did
well."</TE>
<TE>   Moore wanted to brag about three Hart quarterbacks starting for
Pacific 10 schools on the same day.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people say it's the system," he said. "This proves it's
not."</TE>

<HD>Palmer Shoots Down Ducks</HD>
<DH>Quarterback throws for 448 yards and five touchdowns, USC
offense rolls up 608 yards in 44-33 victory that keeps Trojans in the
Rose Bowl hunt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>It took Carson Palmer five tries and four frustrating trips here.</LD>
<LD>   Along the way, he persevered through disastrous errors in
judgment, an agonizing season-ending injury and borderline heroic
performances that always fell just short.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, Palmer finally completed -- and conquered -- his
personal Oregon trail.</LD>
<TE>   Palmer passed for a school-record 448 yards and tied a school
record with five touchdown passes as No. 15 USC defeated No. 14
Oregon, 44-33, before a stunned sellout crowd of 56,754 at Autzen
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved every second of it," said Palmer, a fifth-year senior who
broke his collarbone in a loss to the Ducks in 1999. "There is
nothing better than playing in this place and beating these guys."</TE>
<TE>   Until Saturday, only sixth-year senior fullback Malaefou MacKenzie
knew what it felt like to defeat the Ducks. The Trojans, making their
fourth trip to Autzen Stadium in five years, defeated Oregon at the
Coliseum in 1997 but had not won here since 1993. They also had not
defeated a ranked Pacific 10 Conference opponent on the road since
1995.</TE>
<TE>   USC ended the drought by overcoming a 19-14 halftime deficit with
30 unanswered points to register what might one day be considered a
program-turning victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans were 3-5 at this point last season under first-year
Coach Pete Carroll. Today, they are 6-2 overall, 4-1 in the Pacific
10 Conference and in the hunt for their first Rose Bowl appearance
since the 1995 season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a complete turnaround," senior nose tackle Bernard Riley
said. "We just have to keep it going, stay on the winning streak and
keep it rolling."</TE>
<TE>   USC rolled up 608 yards against the Ducks with help from running
back Justin Fargas, a fifth-year senior transfer from Michigan who
traveled his own agonizing, injury-plagued journey into the Trojan
backfield.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he gave Fargas his first start based on "a gut
feeling" and the way the team reacted to his touchdown run against
Washington last week. Fargas made the most of the opportunity by
rushing for a career-best 139 yards in 27 carries.</TE>
<TE>   After Palmer connected with wide receiver Kareem Kelly on a
31-yard touchdown pass play that gave the Trojans the lead with 11:36
left in the third quarter, Fargas scored five minutes later on a
15-yard run. The play brought back memories of Student Body Right and
put USC ahead, 27-19.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best day of my college career and the biggest victory
I have ever been a part of," Fargas said.</TE>
<TE>   USC's strong finish enabled the Trojans to erase two blown scoring
opportunities from the Oregon five-yard line in the first half.
Rasuli Webster intercepted a pass by Palmer in the end zone and the
Ducks blocked a 22-yard field-goal attempt by Ryan Killeen.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon (6-2, 2-2) took a 19-14 halftime lead on a 54-yard
touchdown reception by Keenan Howry and four field goals by Jared
Siegel. But the Ducks, who gave up a conference-record 536 passing
yards in a loss to Arizona State last week, were overwhelmed in the
second half and suffered consecutive home defeats for the first time
since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   In the final 30 minutes, USC's front seven shut down Oregon's
conference-leading rushing attack, and linebacker Melvin Simmons and
cornerback Darrell Rideaux intercepted passes as the front four
pressured quarterback Jason Fife.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon tailback Onterrio Smith, who was averaging a
conference-leading 133.7 yards a game, finished with only 79 yards in
19 carries, the first time he was held to fewer than 100 yards this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to tell you that it was the greatest halftime
adjustment ever made, but we just went back to work and believed that
we could get it done," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   The offense took care of the rest, controlling the ball for 20
minutes 36 seconds in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   After Palmer's touchdown pass to Kelly and the touchdown run by
Fargas, the Trojans scored again in the third quarter on a 16-yard
reception by freshman wide receiver Mike Williams. In the fourth
quarter, Palmer's eight-yard touchdown pass to MacKenzie and a
48-yard field goal by Killeen put the Trojans ahead, 44-19.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon scored two touchdowns in the final three minutes against
reserves to make the score respectable, but it was by all measures a
rout.</TE>
<TE>   "The feeling in the locker room [at halftime] was that we were
going to blow it out -- we knew we had the win," said Palmer, who
also set a school record with 434 yards of total offense. "We just
needed to keep doing our stuff, keep trusting the offense and running
the plays. They were going to break and they did."</TE>
<TE>   Try as they might, the Ducks could not break Palmer. He completed
14 of 18 passes for 216 yards and two touchdowns in the first half
and 17 of 24 passes for 232 yards and three touchdowns in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer passed to a corps of receivers that chafed all season at
the sight of a huge billboard in downtown Los Angeles that features
three Oregon receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Williams finished with 13 catches for 226 yards and two
touchdowns, the fourth consecutive game he has amassed more than 100
yards. Kelly had six receptions for 94 yards and a touchdown and
MacKenzie also caught six passes for 43 yards and two touchdowns.
Flanker Keary Colbert had four receptions for 77 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said receiver coach Lane Kiffin put a copy of the
billboard on playbooks this week. "We took that personally because we
felt that our three are better than their three," Williams said. "We
had a point to prove. Our game plan just opened it up to show what we
could do."</TE>
<TE>   USC, which has won three games in a row since losing at Washington
State in overtime on Oct. 5, has a bye next week. The Trojans will
use the time off to heal nagging injuries and prepare for a Nov. 9
game at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since Washington State, we knew every game is a championship
game for us," MacKenzie said. "This was another step. This was
definitely one we needed."</TE>

<LD>Gary Klein's keys to the game, and how the Trojans measured up:</LD>
<LD>   1. Control Onterrio Smith. Smith had gained more than 100 yards in
each of the previous seven games, but the Trojans limited him to 79
yards in 19 carries. USC has not allowed a running back to rush for
more than 100 yards this season.</LD>
<LD>   2. Execute the kicking game. The fine play of the offense and
defense overshadowed another shaky performance. USC surrendered an
average of 25.5 yards per kickoff return and tried several pooch
kicks to slow down the Ducks. Ryan Killeen kicked a 48-yard field
goal, but an extra-point and field-goal attempt were blocked.</LD>
<TE>   3. Neutralize the crowd. USC took the Autzen Stadium crowd out of
the game in the second half by scoring 30 unanswered points. The fans
were streaming toward the exits at the start of the fourth quarter.</TE>

<HD>Fargas Has USC in the Running</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Justin Fargas finally showed Saturday what all the fuss was about.</LD>
<LD>   Making his first start for USC, a move that caught some of his
teammates off guard, Fargas lived up to the promise that has gone
largely unfulfilled during an injury-plagued college career.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Pete Carroll played a hunch by starting the hard-running
Fargas, and the senior tailback came through by rushing for a
career-best 139 yards and a touchdown in 27 carries to help USC
trample Oregon, 44-33, in a Pacific 10 Conference game at Autzen
Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   "It felt really good to get out here and find a rhythm," Fargas
said. "The best thing is that we won. It's been a long time coming."</TE>
<TE>   That was true for USC, which ended a four-game losing streak to
Oregon, and for Fargas, whose career has been noteworthy for all the
wrong reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Surgeries outnumbered touchdowns. Disappointment outweighed
success. His exploits as an All-American running back at Sherman Oaks
Notre Dame High were little more than a hazy, distant memory.</TE>
<TE>   He erased it all with a performance that was his biggest game
since his freshman year at Michigan in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything that has happened in the past, the bumps in the road,
this takes care of all that," Fargas said. "Everything happens for a
reason, and I know all that happened for this moment, so we could get
this victory."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches told Fargas on Tuesday that he would start in place of
senior Sultan McCullough, who had gotten most of the carries in the
previous two games but had only two carries Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a gut feeling," Carroll said. "We wanted to come up here
and run real hard against a tough rushing defense. I wanted to make
sure we were falling forward and getting every yard we could, and I
knew that Justin would bring us that style."</TE>
<TE>   News of the switch was kept from most of the Trojans, Carroll
said, so it wouldn't become a distraction. Freshman offensive tackle
Winston Justice said he didn't know Fargas was starting until the
tailback ran out for USC's first play from scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   Justice was well aware of the switch by the time Fargas took a
pitch from quarterback Carson Palmer and ran around the right side,
where Justice anchors the line, for a 15-yard touchdown midway
through the third quarter to give the Trojans a 27-19 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a real confident feeling when Justin is back there,"
Justice said. "He runs the ball hard and fast."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas broke off his biggest run of the day, a 33-yard gain to the
Oregon 32, on USC's next possession to help set up a 16-yard scoring
pass from Palmer to freshman receiver Mike Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "He just lit it up," Carroll said of Fargas, who impressed coaches
with his first touchdown as a Trojan the previous week on a 13-yard
run in a 41-21 victory over Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday was Fargas' best rushing performance since he gained 120
yards in 31 carries in a Big Ten game against Northwestern in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But he was forced to redshirt during the 1999 season while
recovering from three surgeries to repair a broken right leg. Two
titanium rods and 12 screws were implanted in his leg in the first
surgery, then four months later -- when the leg wasn't healing
properly -- doctors re-broke the leg and inserted two metal plates. A
third surgery was performed to repair tendons in his right big toe.</TE>
<TE>   Fargas started the 2000 season as a backup running back for
Michigan, then asked to move to safety after he became frustrated.
After the season, he transferred to USC and underwent ligament
surgery to straighten his right big toe.</TE>
<TE>   "I never lost faith," Fargas said. "You just have to keep moving
forward. And through the grace of God, I've been able to come to this
moment."</TE>
<TE>   While sitting out last season in accordance with NCAA transfer
rules, Fargas was often impressive serving as USC's scout team
tailback. But in early games this season, he frequently was out of
sync. The tailback job appeared to be won by McCullough after he
rushed for 176 yards in 39 carries Oct. 12 against California.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll hinted that USC's opponents have not seen the last of the
6-foot-1, 210-pound Fargas.</TE>
<TE>   After a bye week, the Trojans resume play Nov. 9 at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "The way it looks," Carroll said, "he'll be playing against
Stanford."</TE>

<LD>Rhode Island Coach Tim Stowers has been on the sidelines for plenty
of rain-soaked games. He even coached a game that took place near the
eye of a hurricane.</LD>
<LD>   But the outcome -- or lack thereof -- of Saturday's game against
Richmond was a new one for Stowers.</LD>
<LD>   The game was suspended at halftime because the field was flooded
at Meade Stadium in Kingston, R.I.</LD>
<TE>   Rhode Island's sideline began to collect water during the first
half, and a downpour at halftime submerged the entire field. About 30
minutes after the suspension was announced, the field's grass surface
was no longer visible.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like this happen before," Stowers said.</TE>
<TE>   Richmond was leading, 6-0, but under Atlantic 10 Conference rules,
the game could resume today because three quarters were not
completed. If the game does not get started before noon, Richmond is
credited with a victory.</TE>
<TE>   Richmond Coach Jim Reid said he didn't understand why officials
were considering stopping the game ... until his team exited the
field.</TE>
<TE>   "The water was up to my knees," Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a tall guy, but that's still pretty deep."</TE>

<HD>Regional Airport Agency Founders</HD>
<DH>Conflict appears to doom board asked to create a
broad-based aviation plan, even as passenger, cargo traffic are
expected to surge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Oldham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a fitting epitaph. When asked recently what had become of a
17-year-old agency created to resolve Southern California's airport
capacity woes, City Councilman Hal Bernson swung his right hand up
and then down in a crash-and-burn motion.</LD>
<LD>   The Southern California Regional Airport Authority has disappeared
from the radar -- again. In 1985, and again in 1991, lawmakers
concerned about the inevitability of an air-traffic jam tried to get
the agency off the ground. Each time -- after the expenditure of
hundreds of thousands of tax dollars -- infighting and the inability
to reach consensus led to failure.</LD>
<LD>   In March 2001, Los Angeles County Supervisor Don Knabe resurrected
the group for a third time. The five-member board hoped to bring
together airlines, airport operators and communities to devise
incentives for carriers to move services away from LAX.</LD>
<TE>   The idea was to redistribute passengers among the region's 11
airports to match projections made last year by the Southern
California Assn. of Governments. The group also hoped to study how to
move Orange County passengers and cargo to inland airports, using an
elevated train or some other mass transit system.</TE>
<TE>   Now, less than 18 months later, the authority is again on life
support, suffering from parochialism and the untimely resignation of
several of its members. A poorly written charter also held it back,
sources say.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles County doesn't show up for meetings, Los Angeles city
isn't participating and Riverside County has taken its toys and gone
home," said James Campbell, a spokesman for Orange County Supervisor
Chuck Smith, who holds a seat on the airport authority. "You can't
have a viable entity without participation from all players at the
table."</TE>
<TE>   The agency's apparent demise underscores the difficulty the
Southland's diverse regions have had in preparing for the projected
doubling of airline passengers and quadrupling of air cargo by 2025.
Transportation planners worry that the group's downfall will make it
even tougher to forge a regional consensus.</TE>
<TE>   Without a regional aviation plan to address the growth in
passengers and cargo, Southern California risks losing valuable trade
opportunities to other areas like Las Vegas, Phoenix and San
Francisco, which have airport capacity to spare, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Airports are the Achilles' heel of Southern California's global
engagement," said Steven Erie, a UC San Diego political science
professor who is writing a book about the region's infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   "We will face a 40% shortfall in airport capacity in this region
by 2025 -- larger than any other region in the country. We need a
regional approach more than anyone else. And what little regionalism
we had is about to go the way of the dodo bird."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn's ambitious plan to
cap traffic at Los Angeles International Airport at 78 million
passengers a year -- part of a $9.6-billion proposal to modernize the
aging facility -- rests on the assumption that lawmakers will
persuade airports and constituents in their regions to accept more
travelers.</TE>
<TE>   Regional planners hoped to put millions of passengers at the
former El Toro Marine base in Orange County. But that plan died when
Orange County supervisors formally dropped a decade-long effort to
build an airport after voters approved conversion of the 4,700-acre
base into a so-called Great Park.</TE>
<TE>   Other facilities expected to take up some slack from LAX include
former Air Force bases such as March in Riverside County, Norton in
San Bernardino County and George in Victorville. Airports in Ontario,
Burbank, Palmdale and Long Beach, and John Wayne Airport in Orange
County, were expected to take on additional passengers and cargo.</TE>
<TE>   But many of these regional airports already have capacity
constraints. And officials from areas with underused airfields are
unwilling to take on other regions' problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concentrating" on March Air Force Base, said Jim Venable, a
county supervisor in Riverside. "We're not concerned about Orange
County and its little problems with El Toro. We're not concerned with
what's going on with Los Angeles and with San Bernardino."</TE>
<TE>   Venable resigned from the regional authority board two months ago,
saying it was "of no value at all." He asked the group to refund
$140,000 that Riverside County had paid in dues since the
organization's founding. The group has collected $757,000 in dues
from its members since 1985, according to records kept by the Los
Angeles County controller's office.</TE>
<TE>   Venable's resignation from the agency is reminiscent of a decision
by Orange County to leave the board in the mid-1980s after other
members insisted that it expand John Wayne Airport, said a staff
member who was present at the meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County returned in 1991 after the board agreed to give each
voting member veto power over group decisions. Within two years, the
group fell apart after Los Angeles County refused to fully
participate, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   The airport authority's charter also hampered it, sources add.
Representatives from Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties and the city of Los Angeles are members of the
agency. Through what's known as a joint-powers agreement, the agency
holds the authority to build and operate airports.</TE>
<TE>   But it lacks jurisdiction over existing airport operators, and the
veto provided to each member makes the members more vulnerable to
pressure from anti-expansion constituents.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's decline can also be traced, in part, to Knabe's
motivation for reconstituting the group, sources say. Knabe used the
group to defeat former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's
controversial $12-billion plan to expand LAX to accommodate 89
million passengers a year by 2015, critics say.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors from Los Angeles County, said UC San Diego's Erie,
discovered the group could be used "as leverage to deal with the LAX
master plan and to encourage growth at Palmdale. "Once they achieved
a cap at LAX," Erie said, "they lost interest."</TE>
<TE>   Knabe refused repeated requests for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles and Riverside counties weren't the only agency members
that lost interest. Los Angeles City Council President Alex Padilla
left the board last winter, citing too many committee and nonprofit
commitments, said David Gershwin, his press deputy.</TE>
<TE>   Community members say that Hahn's failure to fill the city's spot
conveyed the message that Los Angeles wasn't interested in regional
planning beyond its own facilities, which include LAX, Ontario
International Airport and Palmdale Regional Airport.</TE>
<TE>   That's untrue, said Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook, who added that
the mayor chose not to participate in the airport authority because
he believes the Southern California Assn. of Governments is a more
efficient and democratic body to compose a regional aviation plan.</TE>
<TE>   But even the association's leadership has acknowledged that it
doesn't have the power to see that airports take their predictions
into consideration. And those who sit on the association's 42-member
aviation task force argue that the body's size can be an impediment
on issues that call for timely decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   Regional airport authority officers dispute the perception that
the board is on life support, saying it can carry on without
Riverside County and the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "With three members you can conduct business, but you cannot
change the bylaws," said Chief Executive Peggy Ducey.</TE>
<TE>   The group's remaining members are scheduled to take a trip to
Germany in early November to view remote terminals that link outlying
areas with Frankfurt International Airport. After that, the remaining
board members will decide what to do next, Ducey said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to say that the organization won't go away. It
may," she said. "The organization can go dormant again, or it can
continue to move toward a solution to the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the state may have to intervene to remove local
interests from the regional aviation picture, as it did in San Diego,
Erie said.</TE>
<TE>   State legislation signed into law last fall created the San Diego
County Regional Airport Authority to formulate a plan for the aging
Lindbergh Field. The group is charged with submitting a ballot
initiative that recommends an alternate site for the airport by
November 2004 or November 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators worked to depoliticize the group, which must figure

<HD>New Mayor to Run a Changed Anaheim</HD>
<DH>Four candidates seek the job in a city whose Latino
population has nearly doubled since '90.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Anaheim prepares to elect a new mayor Nov. 5, the one-time German
farming colony turned postwar suburban boom town finds itself taking
on the look and feel of what many residents moved there hoping to
escape: a diverse, big city.</LD>
<LD>   With the 2000 census counting 328,014 people, a 23% increase in a
decade, Anaheim ranks just behind Cincinnati among the nation's
largest cities. Since 1990, its white population dropped by nearly a
quarter and its Latino population nearly doubled. There are new,
manicured subdivisions in its eastern hills and aging, lower-income
neighborhoods on the western flats.</LD>
<LD>   In between, there is Disney, the convention center, the hotels and
Orange County's two professional sports teams, tourist draws that
bring more than 40 million visitors to the city each year.</LD>
<TE>   Four candidates are vying to become mayor and manage the city's
development and redevelopment.</TE>
<TE>   Two are City Hall insiders: council members Frank Feldhaus, 74,
and Lucille Kring, 59. Two are outsiders: former Assembly Speaker
Curt Pringle, 43, and former La Habra Police Chief Steve Staveley,
58.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, the story is Curt Pringle," said Fred Smoller, chairman of
the political science department at Chapman University. "Can the
city's favorite son regain his mantle and win elected office in a
community that has changed dramatically?"</TE>
<TE>   Pringle's family ran a drapery business in Anaheim for 25 years.
He represented half the city during six of his eight years in the
Assembly. In 1988, Pringle, aided by the local GOP, stationed private
guards at polling places in Latino neighborhoods in Santa Ana because
he feared Democrats were going to bus in illegal immigrants to vote.
Some of the guards challenged voters and demanded identification.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Pringle and the party settled a civil rights lawsuit
for $400,000. To Pringle, the controversy is yesterday's news; he
recently reached out to Latino leaders in Anaheim in their fight with
city officials to bring a Mexican-owned Gigante supermarket to town.</TE>
<TE>   "Anaheim has great diversity, not just ethnically," Pringle said.
"You have varying needs across the city, and a lot of it boils down
to improving the infrastructure. It's not glamorous stuff, but it's
been ignored for many years. There are many major streets that have
gone without public improvements for decades."</TE>
<TE>   But memories of the poll guards linger with Latino leaders, said
Amin David, president of the Anaheim-based rights group Los Amigos of
Orange County and a candidate for the Anaheim Union High School
District Board of Education. David has endorsed Staveley, the only
Democrat among the four candidates in the nonpartisan race.</TE>
<TE>   David, like others, believes Anaheim has splintered into four
cities under one government -- the old, the new, downtown and the
resort.</TE>
<TE>   After a decade that brought a massive revitalization of the resort
district -- the city's economic engine -- Anaheim is turning its
sights on neighborhood projects and redevelopment downtown. This year
the City Council approved a five-year, $583-million capital
improvement fund for projects including community centers, parks and
road and sewer upgrades, city spokesman John Nicoletti said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to take over for the next four years and complete some of
the projects that we started on the council," said Feldhaus, who
moved to Anaheim in 1959 and owns a telephone messaging company. "I
know the inner workings of the city. I've worked with two city
managers, a lot of staff members and department heads. Those
relationships will help in getting things done."</TE>
<TE>   Staveley has lived in Anaheim more than 30 years. He has seen the
city flourish but believes Anaheim has lost its focus on the way to
becoming one of the two largest urban centers in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a vision for this city right now," said Staveley, a
consultant for a law firm. "Anaheim needs to become a destination
residential community." To accomplish that, he wants to convert his
community policing background into community-oriented government. As
mayor, he would keep regular office hours to allow residents to visit
him and would consider neighborhood meetings to field local concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "We need new ideas and we need the community input to help us get
them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Businesswoman Kring has been on the Anaheim City Council four
years and is running for mayor because she believes Anaheim "should
be America's most dynamic city."</TE>
<TE>   "What's wrong with Anaheim?" she said. "Have you been to our
meetings? This city needs a mayor who's a problem solver, leader and
consensus builder."</TE>
<TE>   Kring fired the first political salvo in August when she sued to
prohibit Feldhaus and Staveley from using mayor pro-tem and retired
police chief, respectively, as their listed professions on the
November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Though she won, she declined to discuss her lawsuit. "It's old
news. I don't want to talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   She did express displeasure with the partisan battle that has
materialized between Republican Pringle and Democrat Staveley, who
has been endorsed by Mayor Tom Daly. Daly is leaving office after 10
years because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad," she said of the partisanship. "People want simple
things. They want to know that their city is safe and that the trees
are trimmed."</TE>
<TE>   Pringle raised $143,000 for his campaign through September.
Feldhaus raised $106,000, Kring $105,000 and Staveley about $72,000.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven candidates are seeking at-large seats on the council
vacated by Feldhaus and Kring. They are: Richard Chavez, Stephen
Eichler, Robert Flores, Robert Hernandez, John Koos, Robert McDonald,
James Mills, Stefanie O'Neill, Manny Ontiveros, Harry Sidhu and Bob
Zemel.</TE>

<HD>Forests Show Resilience as Fires Pass</HD>
<DH>Despite grim evaluations during summer, officials say large
swaths only lightly burned. Some areas are the better for a needed
cleaning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bettina Boxall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KERNVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>As flames leaped across the West this summer, so did the hyperbole.
If fires weren't devastating, they were horrific or catastrophic.
Colorado's governor at one point declared his state ablaze.
Television sets blared the peril to California's groves of giant
sequoias.</LD>
<LD>   In August, President Bush tramped through the charred landscape of
a fire that had raged across southern Oregon and Northern California
and declared the sight a "crying shame."</LD>
<LD>   But now that the smoke has cleared, the scene is not so grim. In
the path of each of the major wildfires that captured national
attention this year, large swaths of land emerged only lightly burned
-- often better off for a much needed forest cleaning.</LD>
<TE>   In Sequoia National Forest, where a fire burned for six weeks and
threatened some of the most majestic trees on Earth, only about 8% of
the 150,000 acres that burned was severely damaged, according to an
analysis by the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   While the most heavily burned timberland will take generations to
fully heal, elsewhere new life is already poking through blackened
earth. Bouquets of fresh green sprouts are rising from charred
stumps.</TE>
<TE>   "People go out there and the first response is, 'Oh, my God, it's
horrible,' " said Terry Kaplan-Henry, a hydrologist who is leading
emergency recovery work in the Sequoia forest. "It's coming back
already. In three years, it probably will look great."</TE>
<TE>   Roughly 6.7 million acres of drought-stressed wild lands burned
this year in the continental United States and Alaska, less than in
2000 but enough to make it one of the five worst fire seasons in the
last 40 years, according to statistics from the National Interagency
Fire Center in Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   More land may yet burn in places like Southern California, where
the fire season will not end until the arrival of soaking rains.</TE>
<TE>   Along with their size, the wildfires' locations drew attention.
Big burns in Colorado licked the edges of Denver's suburbs, and tens
of thousands of residents were evacuated from the edges of forests in
Arizona. In California, flames crept within a mile of sequoias.</TE>
<TE>   The television images of forest infernos spilled onto the
political landscape as some Western lawmakers complained that the
woods had grown into highly flammable thickets because of
environmental regulations.</TE>
<TE>   At the site of a 500,000-acre fire in southern Oregon, Bush
lamented the consequences of "bad forest policy," and called for an
emergency program to increase logging and thinning in federal
forests.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by the White House, legislation that would curtail legal
challenges to future logging is now pending in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, the Oregon blaze was not the best example of a
forest in smoky ruin. Examining the severity of the Siskiyou National
Forest fire -- pockets of which are still smoldering -- federal
scientists found that roughly 60% of the acreage had been burned
relatively lightly or escaped unburned.</TE>
<TE>   "The media in general tends to use those sensationalizing words
like 'devastating,' and many times from an ecosystem standpoint,
that's not accurate," said Greg Clevenger, resources staff officer
for the Rogue River and Siskiyou national forests.</TE>
<TE>   Wildfires do not burn in solid blocks. They skip around, gaining
and losing intensity according to the terrain, wind and time of day.
On steep ground and in the hot, windy hours of the late afternoon,
they can roar across the landscape, consuming all in their path. At
night, when it is cooler, or on a gentle slope, the flames grow
calmer and less destructive.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a quilt of burn patterns. Some areas that burned
this summer were devastated, stripped of life, their soils cooked and
hardened, wildlife gone. Others were less damaged; much, but not all,
of the vegetation was killed, and the soils still can nourish new
life.</TE>
<TE>   Many pockets of forest were left unharmed as the flames skirted
them. And some land received the kind of light burn that does a
forest good, cleaning out dead and small growth and recycling
nutrients.</TE>
<TE>   In Sequoia National Forest east of Bakersfield, half of the
150,000 affected acres was lightly burned or not burned at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally speaking, a large percent of that fire isn't that bad,"
Kaplan-Henry said. "The low burn was a good, healthy, beneficial
thing, and even some of the moderate burn will be good." The
hydrologist said that within two weeks of the blaze, which started in
July in the Kern River Canyon with an escaped campfire, she started
seeing new growth sprouting.</TE>
<TE>   Once-brushy hills that, from a distance, appear to be blackened
wastelands reveal scattered bursts of green shoots on closer
inspection. Healthy pines loom against scorched underbrush like lines
of green sprinkles on a burnt Christmas cookie.</TE>
<TE>   Scorched pines are dropping their needles, providing a natural
mulch that will help guard against the soil erosion that is one of
the greatest concerns in a wildfire's aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   In some places, foresters will provide added protection. Straw
mulch will be dropped from helicopters or trucks, dead trees will be
felled and positioned on the ground to slow runoff, allowing the
water to seep into the ground. Road culverts are being repaired or
enlarged.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan-Henry and her colleagues are hoping for steady rains that
filter into the ground rather than pounding storms that rush over the
bare ground, carrying off tons of soil.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get a large storm event at the wrong time, before things
have a chance to recover a bit, there's nothing we can do," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The cumulative effects of this summer's fire and two earlier
wildfires in the Sequoia forest are also altering the wildlife
habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Deer will benefit from forest openings created by the blaze, but
two rare species -- the California spotted owl and the Pacific fisher
-- lost some territory, said biologist Steven Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   The fisher habitat in particular has been fragmented by the three
fires, and that could further isolate the southern Sierra population
of the weasel-like animal, Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Oregon fire -- about 30,000 acres of which extend into
California -- more than half the burn area is in relatively good
shape.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes in and cleans out a lot of fuel build-up," Clevenger, the
national forest resources officer in Oregon, said of the low burn,
which covered about 200,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the Arizona and Colorado wildfires, which destroyed
hundreds of residences and forced mass evacuations, large portions of
the burned areas escaped without great environmental damage.</TE>
<TE>   About half of the land in the 138,000-acre Hayman fire, the
largest in Colorado history, was lightly burned or unburned,
according to the Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   "It has thinned the smaller trees that would lead to overcrowded
stand density," said Ken Kanaan, a soil scientist who is heading the
fire's emergency rehabilitation effort. "[That] looks like just what
we'd like to see if we had done a controlled burn in the area."</TE>
<TE>   Kanaan said the extremely dry conditions that promoted the fire
also may have helped slow soil damage. Dry soil doesn't conduct heat
as well as moist soil, so the ground was less likely to get so hot
that it broiled the microorganisms vital to healthy earth. "Those
little critters aren't steamed in place," was how Kanaan put it.</TE>
<TE>   About a third of the Hayman fire zone was severely burned, and
reforestation will go slowly there.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not looking at trees there for a very long time unless we
go in and plant," Kanaan said. There simply aren't any live trees
left in those areas to reseed the next generation.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, given the blaze's size and proximity to metropolitan
Denver, Kanaan said, "There's no other way to describe it than
devastating. It swallowed up private inholdings and residences. It's
very devastating to the people who are in the burn area."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Hibbetts, a Forest Service retiree who returned temporarily to
help with restoration planning for the Arizona fire, vacationed as a
child in the highlands that burned this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "To me it was horrifying," he said. "I hate to see timber burn. So
much of that is going to rot and fall down. The fire is so large it
boggles your mind."</TE>
<TE>   Two wildfires merged in late June, spreading over 463,000 acres of
the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest and the Fort Apache Indian
Reservation. But again, not all is death and desolation.</TE>
<TE>   There are areas where nothing is left but sand and rock. There are
areas that were cleaned out in a way that will be good for wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "What people tend to forget is, it will grow back," Clevenger
said. "I'm not saying all fires are good all the time. But we tend,
as a society, to sensationalize and over-dramatize the effect of
fire. Fire is a natural process. It plays a role like the wind and
the rain."</TE>

<HD>Rep. Capps in Tough Fight</HD>
<DH>Campaign experts say an upset in District 23 race is
possible as GOP's well-heeled challenger, Beth Rogers, pulls within
striking distance.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a year of redrawn political boundaries that favor incumbents, Rep.
Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara) starts with a clear edge over Oxnard
businesswoman Beth Rogers, her Republican opponent in the Nov. 5
election.</LD>
<LD>   Registered Democrats hold a 12% advantage over Republicans in the
narrow congressional district that stretches from the bluffs of San
Luis Obispo to Oxnard's fertile plains.</LD>
<LD>   Capps, 64, a two-term incumbent, has raised $1.34 million to win
over 325,000 potential voters. She launched her campaign with a
high-brow Hope Ranch fund-raiser starring the Democratic Party's
cheerleader-in-chief, former President Clinton.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, political strategists say an upset is not out of the
question. And that is largely because Capps' competitor is smart --
and rich.</TE>
<TE>   Beth Rogers, 56, who comes from a fourth-generation Ventura County
farming family, has proved she can raise a lot of money too.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers has more than matched Capps' fund-raising with $1.44
million, though about half is from her own bank account.</TE>
<TE>   In campaign appearances, Rogers has impressed audiences with her
command of issues. She speaks fluent Spanish, a benefit with the
growing number of local Latino residents.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-two percent of the 23rd Congressional District is Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Her conservative stance on taxes and moderate social beliefs make
her an attractive candidate for the old-line Republicans in Santa
Maria's ranches and Santa Barbara's tony hillsides, strategists say.</TE>
<TE>   "Lois is facing, without a doubt, the strongest Republican she has
ever faced," said Allan Hoffenblum, a GOP strategist and publisher of
the "California Target Book," which tracks candidates in state and
federal races.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one heck of a competitive race, because Rogers is actually
spending the money. She's raised over $1 million and she's all over
TV and radio," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Democrats aren't too concerned.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the party's money and attention in California are focused
on the tight race for an open Modesto congressional seat being
vacated by Democratic Rep. Gary Condit.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Rubey, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee in Washington, D.C., said Capps has a strong moderate
record that will bring victory next month.</TE>
<TE>   "We think she's in good shape," Rubey said.</TE>
<TE>   A school nurse for 30 years, Capps assumed office for the first
time five years ago after her congressman husband died of a heart
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers, a no-nonsense businesswoman who runs her family's sod farm
near Camarillo, is mounting her first candidacy after years of
working behind the scenes to elect moderate Republican women.</TE>
<TE>   Both women have endured personal tragedies that shaped their
lives.</TE>
<TE>   Capps' husband, Walter, a popular professor of religious studies
at UC Santa Barbara, died just a few months into his first term.</TE>
<TE>   Capps was thrust into the position of making funeral plans at the
same time she was deciding whether to run for his seat.</TE>
<TE>   She won in a special election in March 1998. Two years later, her
oldest daughter, Lisa, a psychology professor at UC Berkeley, died of
lung cancer at 35.</TE>
<TE>   Those painful losses renewed her commitment to public service,
Capps said.</TE>
<TE>   "I see my job as helping people make things work," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers' first husband died from cancer, leaving her with two young
children. That forced her to become "completely practical," Rogers
said.</TE>
<TE>   She jumped into the family's ranching business, remarried, earned
a master's degree in business administration and took over Pacific
Sod, which employs 200 people.</TE>
<TE>   Doctoral studies in anthropology took her to Mexico, where she
became fluent in Spanish, Rogers said.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband, Richard, raised as foster parents the son of
one of their Salvadoran workers.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates tilt toward a moderate political philosophy
focused on such social issues as improving education, controlling
health care costs, preserving Social Security and protecting the
environment. But they differ in the details.</TE>
<TE>   Capps obtained a one-year moratorium on new oil drilling off the
Central Coast and seeks a permanent ban on the leases.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers opposes drilling, too, but said the offshore leases should
be bought out by the government.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent fund-raising period, Capps raised $75,000 and
had $635,890 in cash for the final days of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Organized labor has been her biggest financial supporter, giving
her $127,000 as of Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   She also received sizable contributions from health care,
communication and insurance interests and hundreds of checks from
wealthy Santa Barbara supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Finance reports show that Rogers is spending nearly every dollar
that flows in.</TE>
<TE>   She collected $48,000 during the first two weeks of October and
loaned herself $100,000. She has pumped $726,000 of her own money
into the campaign, so far.</TE>
<TE>   With nine days left, Rogers had just $66,600 left.</TE>
<TE>   A third candidate for the seat is Libertarian James Hill, 49, of
Oceano, who inspects pressure pipes at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear
Power Plant near San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   He is running on a platform of reducing government interference in
people's lives.</TE>
<TE>   Hill says citizens are already overtaxed and over-regulated. If
elected, he would work to limit the influence of special interests in
government and close the U.S. Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   His entire campaign will cost less than $5,000, he said.</TE>

<TE>   Capps does not support public funding of private schools through
vouchers and said she never will. Rogers says they may be necessary
to help students stuck in failing public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Capps obtained a one-year moratorium on new oil drilling off the
Central Coast and seeks a permanent ban on the leases.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers opposes drilling, too, but said the offshore leases should
be bought out by the government.</TE>
<TE>   As for forest drilling, Rogers said she prefers to explore
alternative energy sources and that the federal government should pay
for the research.</TE>
<TE>   Capps opposes the Bush administration's review of the National
Environmental Policy Act, the landmark 1969 legislation that paved
the way for environmental scrutiny of federal projects; Rogers says
the 33-year-old law has become unwieldy and "needs to be looked at."</TE>
<TE>   In a recent debate, the candidates offered starkly different views
on the Bush administration's call for a possible preemptive strike
against Iraq to remove its leader, Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Capps, who voted to deny the president that authority earlier this
month, said unilateral military action would be premature and
potentially dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said she would have voted in favor of the Bush resolution,
calling Hussein a "proven aggressor," but prefers that the
administration work with the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers' campaign manager, Bob Tapella, said it was a difficult
issue for the candidate because her 21-year-old son, Davis, is in the
Air Force and could be called to action.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent fund-raising period, Capps raised $75,000 and
had $635,890 in cash for the final days of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Organized labor has been her biggest financial supporter, giving
her $127,000 as of Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   She also received sizable contributions from health care,

<TE>   Hill's entire campaign will cost less than $5,000, he said.</TE>

educational experience."</TE>

<HD>7 Hurt When Van Carrying UC Irvine Soccer Team Collides
With SUV</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul McLeod</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A van carrying members of the UC Irvine men's soccer team collided
with another vehicle and crashed Saturday morning at a Costa Mesa
freeway interchange, injuring seven people, one seriously.</LD>
<LD>   Several passengers were not wearing seat belts.</LD>
<LD>   The van was one of two university-owned vehicles carrying 21
players and coaches to a Big West Conference game at UC Riverside.
The other van was not involved.</LD>
<TE>   The most seriously hurt passenger was taken to Western Medical
Center-Santa Ana with injuries to his chest, arms and legs, said
Capt. Randy Croll of the Costa Mesa Fire Department. The university
declined to release the names of the injured, but several team
members identified the most seriously hurt as freshman forward Kyle
Close of Elk Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Six others were taken to Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in
Newport Beach with cuts, bruises and possible back injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Volk, an assistant coach, was driving the oversized van when
it left Crawford Hall with about 10 people, said Irvine Coach George
Kuntz, who was riding with Volk. Neither Volk nor Kuntz was injured.</TE>
<TE>   Volk was entering the northbound Costa Mesa Freeway from the
Corona del Mar Freeway about 10:30 a.m. when it caromed off an SUV
driven by an unidentified woman.</TE>
<TE>   The collision sent the van careening to its right, where it hit an
embankment and toppled onto its right side. The SUV driver did not
stop, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters and paramedics from Costa Mesa and Newport Beach
responded and closed the northbound Baker Street offramp for more
than an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a certain question as to whether -- or how many of them
-- were wearing seat belts," Croll said. "That certainly can
contribute to injuries in any accident."</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol is investigating, a spokesman in
Santa Ana said.</TE>
<TE>   Teammates and family members met at Hoag on Saturday afternoon as
the injured were treated.</TE>
<TE>   "This reminds you how fragile life is," said senior midfielder
Joel Spencer, who said he was not wearing a seat belt while riding in
the van that crashed but was not injured. Several more players
probably were not strapped in, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bush, a junior defender, was riding in the second van and said
that he had a good view of the accident. "[The driver of the SUV] ,
merged into [Volk's] lane and clipped the front left of the van," he
said. "The van spun out and I think he tried to correct it, but he
over-corrected and it spun around and flipped on its side."</TE>
<TE>   Kuntz said Volk had very little time to react. "The lady pulled
into our van and it flipped," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our primary concern is with the well-being of the players and
their respective recoveries," said Petrina Long, Irvine's associate
athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's accident was at least the seventh report nationwide in
the last two years of serious injuries to college players traveling

<HD>A Day for the Dead -- and Living -- Draws Revelers to
Cemetery</HD>
<DH>Several thousand people, some dressed as skeletons or
Death, observe a favorite Latin American holiday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Below the lush grass, the skeletons at Hollywood Forever Cemetery are
resting for all eternity.</LD>
<LD>   But on Saturday, above ground, the skeletons danced. They waved,
laughed, ate and walked hand in hand with children. They greeted
visitors at the cemetery's gates, or peeked out playfully from behind
the bronze doors of mausoleums.</LD>
<LD>   It was a day for the dead, as the living gathered to remember the
departed to honor one of Latin America's most beloved holidays, the
odd and ancient celebration known as Dia de Los Muertos.</LD>
<TE>   "We celebrate death, and we celebrate life!" one skeleton in a top
hat yelled.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Day of the Dead is observed on Nov. 2, Hollywood
Forever's third annual festival drew several thousand people, some
dressed as skeletons or Death himself.</TE>
<TE>   The festival featured several stages with bands playing
traditional Mexican folk music, stop-and-go short plays performed by
local theater companies, rows of handicrafts and face-painting
stands--skeleton masks, of course.</TE>
<TE>   But lavish altars attracted the most attention. They were
decorated with candles, pictures of the deceased and lots of orange
cenpazuchilt flowers, the customary Day of the Dead blossom better
known as marigolds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tradition," said event coordinator Daisy Marquez. "You can
do an altar for your loved one. It doesn't matter where the body is;
the souls are free, right?"</TE>
<TE>   One altar at the base of a massive mausoleum was dedicated to
Hattie McDaniel, the actress who won an Oscar for her role in "Gone
With the Wind," but who was not allowed to be buried at Hollywood
Forever because she was black.</TE>
<TE>   Artist Juan Sigala used at least 200 candles and several bouquets
of marigolds to create his homage to McDaniel. The offering at her
side was bread laid out in the shape of a cross.</TE>
<TE>   "She always wanted to be buried here," Sigala said.</TE>
<TE>   So whose grave is it that McDaniel's altar sits upon? "I don't
know, and I hope the family doesn't show up."</TE>
<TE>   With roots dating back hundreds of years before the arrival of the
Spanish in the Americas, the Day of the Dead is celebrated mostly in
Mexico to honor both those who have died and the continuity of life.
That means, in a way, mocking death, hence the jolly skeleton
costumes.</TE>
<TE>   Young hipsters, curious couples and Latino families meandered
through the memorial park.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this; it really is the most creative of holidays," said
Janis Helbert, 55, who wore a black plush cape and came to visit a
friend recently buried at the cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten, 15 years ago this would have been a little too farfetched,"
said Kerry Hogan, 36. "But people have assimilated the new culture
with their own."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning this weekend, events are planned all over the region, at
sites ranging from artsy cafes and galleries in Silver Lake to
municipal parks in East Los Angeles and Santa Ana. There are art
shows, workshops on how to make paper flowers and masks, political
gatherings, performances for local neo-Latin bands and Aztec dance
companies, and of course, traditional festivals like that at
Hollywood Forever.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very fitting," said Gabriela Cantero, 35, as she watched
Aztec dancers drum before an altar honoring deceased Latino movie
stars including Rita Hayworth.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Yesenea Zavala toiled over her husband's unmarked grave.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to think, why Day of the Dead? Why celebrate something
like death? But after my husband died, I feel like death is just a
passing to an eternal life," Zavala said. "I am not afraid of death
anymore, and now I celebrate Day of the Dead."</TE>

<HD>In Race's Final Laps, Davis and Simon Debate on the Run</HD>
<DH>The gubernatorial rivals clash at long distance on the
issues of education and integrity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Z. Barabak and Michael Finnegan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gray Davis and Bill Simon Jr. clashed at long distance Saturday over
personal integrity and the state of California's schools, as the race
for governor headed into its final full week of campaigning.</LD>
<LD>   Democratic Gov. Davis used a series of appearances before
supporters across the Southland to boast of a turnabout in public
education and to criticize his Republican rival's failure to vote in
several past elections.</LD>
<LD>   "It's all very nice to say, 'I'm for parks and I'm for schools,'
but you've got to walk the walk and vote," Davis told an enthusiastic
Burbank audience attending the state convention of the National Assn.
for the Advancement of Colored People.</LD>
<TE>   Simon, hopscotching from Los Angeles to the Bay Area to the
Central Valley, said "California's education system is broken," and
he seized on Davis' latest spate of negative TV ads to challenge the
governor's credibility. Davis began airing a renewed series of spots
attacking Simon's business record after campaign strategists earlier
announced plans to run nothing but positive advertisements until
election day, Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "It only took him a week to break his word," Simon said at a
Burlingame convention of community college students. "That's a
world's record even for Davis."</TE>
<TE>   There are no more face-to-face debates scheduled in the
gubernatorial campaign. So with just 10 days left, the candidates
resorted to the staples of the home-stretch: a barrage of TV ads
buttressed with a batch of public appearances designed to inspire
their most fervent backers and try to coax them to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   For Davis, that meant appearances at the NAACP convention in
Burbank, a rally with Asian American supporters in Monterey Park and
a stop with firefighters at a Democratic Party branch office in
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Simon began the day at a Los Angeles prayer breakfast with
supporters from the religious community. He then traveled to stops in
Burlingame and a precinct walk in Modesto.</TE>
<TE>   Although the NAACP does not make endorsements, the sentiment of
its leadership was obvious when Davis showed up Saturday. "I had to
be nice yesterday" when Simon appeared, said the California branch
president, Alice Huffman, a longtime Democratic activist. "I don't
have to be nice today."</TE>
<TE>   She praised Davis for his work on education, a thread the governor
picked up when he spoke to the crowd of about 200 delegates. Claiming
credit for rising test scores, increased teacher pay and greater
accessibility to higher education for poor and minority students,
Davis said, "Yes, we have a long way to go, but we're on the right
track, my friends."</TE>
<TE>   At roughly the same time, Simon was in Burlingame, a suburb of San
Francisco, offering a diametrically different portrait of the state's
schools. Speaking to about 150 community college students at their
semiannual leadership conference, Simon cited crumbling facilities,
millions of failing students and a lack of accountability as symptoms
of an education policy that has left California schools in a
shambles.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not teaching our kids adequately," said Simon. "We can't
have toleration for mediocrity. We can't have toleration for
failure."</TE>
<TE>   Simon scrapped his lengthy prepared remarks, which bristled with
anti-Davis rhetoric, in favor of a more low-key, conversational tone.
Appearing with his wife, Cindy, Simon referred to community colleges
as "the crown jewel" of California's public education system, serving
as a bridge between high school and four-year universities as well as
a second-opportunity stop for professionals seeking new career
avenues.</TE>
<TE>   He criticized the governor -- whom he repeatedly referred to as
"Mr. Davis" -- for cutting tens of millions of dollars in community
college funds as part of his solution for closing the state's
$23.6-billion budget deficit. But during an often contentious
question-and-answer session with students afterward, Simon
acknowledged the fiscal difficulties that are still straitjacketing
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about raising community college funding to a level equal to
spending on the University of California and state university systems
-- which would more than triple the current budget -- Simon said he
could not make that promise. "I don't think that would be realistic,"
he said, suggesting the next governor will face "tough decisions" in
light of continued budget problems.</TE>
<TE>   While faulting Davis' "mismanagement" for the crunch, Simon would
not commit to restoring millions of dollars in teacher bonuses that
were suspended for this academic year as another budget-balancing
step. Simon merely said he would favor renewing the program "as soon
as we can."</TE>

<KH>TIMES HOLIDAY FUND</KH>
<HD>A Battered Wife Gets Assistance -- and a New Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Erika Hayasaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The battered-women's hotline rang at the Ocean Park Community Center
in Santa Monica. On the line was a hospital emergency room worker
trying to help an immigrant woman whose face was bleeding after a
brutal beating by her husband.</LD>
<LD>   The crisis line staff arranged to accommodate the woman, who spoke
limited English, and her son at the center's shelter. After several
weeks of counseling, the two found an apartment, where they now live
safely away from the woman's abuser.</LD>
<LD>   "Her story is not atypical," said Roxann Smith, a director at the
center, which also provides education and counseling for victims of
abuse.</LD>
<TE>   A $15,000 grant from the Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign
enabled the organization to help the battered mother and others like
her.</TE>
<TE>   "It's critically important for our program to get funding from
community organizations like the Los Angeles Times fund," Smith said.
This week, The Times launches its annual Holiday Campaign to raise
money for Southern California charities that help disadvantaged
children and families.</TE>
<TE>   Charitable donations to community groups have declined with the
stock market slide and last year's Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But
growing numbers of people who cannot afford health or social services
still need help, leaders of some social service agencies say.</TE>
<TE>   The Holiday Campaign, established in 2000, is mounted by the Los
Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the McCormick Tribune
Foundation. The foundation will match the first $700,000 raised at 50
cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   "All administrative costs are absorbed by The Times," said
Publisher John Puerner, "so every dollar donated goes directly to
organizations that help children and youth."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the holiday appeal and matching funds raised $653,000,
which was granted to 56 charities serving Los Angeles, Orange,
Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   A Holiday Campaign donation helped the Catholic Charities of San
Bernardino and Riverside feed and house a homeless family of five in
a motel for several weeks last month, said Beverly Earl, director of
the organization, which provides needy families with food, diapers
and medicine, and sometimes pays for their heat or air-conditioning.
Catholic Charities eventually helped the family find a permanent
residence, Earl said.</TE>
<TE>   Times money donated to Project Sister Sexual Assault Crisis
Services Center in Pomona last year went toward sexual abuse
prevention education programs in schools, said Linda Shestock,
executive director.</TE>
<TE>   "Families are under a lot of economic stress," she said. "We're
experiencing both a high degree of increased requests for services
and a lower degree of donations."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Safe Seats Mean Few Voters Get Real Choice</HD>
<DH>Of more than 150 seats at stake in California for the
Legislature and Congress, analysts say no more than 10 are
competitive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carl Ingram and Jean Merl</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the political experts are right, only a relative handful of
Californians will have a real choice on Nov. 5 when they pick who
will represent them in the Legislature and Congress next year.</LD>
<LD>   Of more than 150 seats at stake in the state Senate, Assembly and
the House of Representatives, no more than 10 are rated by many
political professionals, analysts and academics as genuinely
contested.</LD>
<LD>   Put another way, about 140 districts are safe from competition by
the opposing party, a circumstance that could persist in certain
parts of the state for the next decade.</LD>
<TE>   In the Assembly, all 80 seats are up for election -- 32 of them
with no incumbent running -- but only about half a dozen are
seriously contested, most experts agree. Of the 53 House districts,
they say only one is a genuine fight. Only one of the 20 state Senate
offices up for election is considered to be in earnest contention.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the action this year is in the Central Valley. It is the
site of the single hot House race for the seat once held by Rep. Gary
Condit, the only contested state Senate election and a handful of
competitive Assembly battles: in the 10th, 17th, 26th and 30th
districts. Winning the 15th District seat in neighboring Contra Costa
County is a high priority for both parties.</TE>
<TE>   In the south, close competitions are being waged in races for two
other open Assembly seats: the 78th District in San Diego County and
the 80th in Imperial and Riverside counties.</TE>
<TE>   Why so few competitive races elsewhere in California? Blame the
Legislature, which realigned political boundaries last year in what
is known as redistricting, the once-a-decade drawing of new lines to
reflect population changes reported in the U.S. census.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare agreement, the Democratic and Republican parties reached
a deal in which the lines were drawn to preserve the partisan makeup
of the two houses of the Legislature and the congressional
delegation.</TE>
<TE>   The result was to assure that Democrats would remain the majority
party and Republicans, a shrinking minority, would slip no further
for the next few elections at least.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sweetheart deal that cements everyone in place," said
Tony Quinn, a Republican commentator who used to write redistricting
plans for the Assembly GOP.</TE>
<TE>   The realignment represents "a detriment to democracy, but it
certainly is not a detriment to the two parties," Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   Many political experts predicted that the lack of competitive
races, and a resulting lack of active campaigning, would further
erode voter interest and contribute to what many fear will be a
record low turnout in California.</TE>
<TE>   But in at least some of the races deemed noncompetitive, the
candidates are hard at work wooing voters.</TE>
<TE>   The politically moderate 36th Congressional District in the South
Bay, for example, was redrawn to favor the reelection of Rep. Jane
Harman (D-Venice).</TE>
<TE>   But Harman, saying she takes nothing for granted, has been making
trips home from Washington every weekend, holding round-table
discussions on the local economy, working to settle the labor dispute
that crippled the area's harbors and trying to help Los Angeles
County officials resolve a health crisis that threatens to close
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Her campaign has been busy telephoning
voters.</TE>
<TE>   Her Republican challenger, Stuart Johnson, an attorney who lives
in Manhattan Beach, has been walking precincts daily for several
weeks, meeting with area Rotary clubs and chambers of commerce and
raising enough money to employ a full-time campaign staff of four.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe there is more interest in this race than the so-called
experts think," said Johnson, noting that he and Harman were
scheduled to debate at least three times before election day.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Tim Hodson of the Center for California Studies at Cal
State Sacramento said that if the public perceives that redistricting
has preordained an outcome of the election, "it will have an adverse
effect on voter turnout and, in a general sense, on the health of the
electoral system."</TE>
<TE>   But Hodson, who formerly drew redistricting plans for the Senate,
said the "shelf life" of a redistricting program is limited and its
partisan effectiveness gets diluted in time, as population shifts
gradually blunt the district mapmakers' handiwork.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson of Culver City agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is permanent," said Wesson, whose Democrats dominate the
Assembly 50 to 30, four short of the two-thirds majority needed to
pass budgets and other major legislation without Republican help.</TE>
<TE>   Even with only a handful of competitive Assembly races, he said, a
letup in campaign spending is unlikely. "We will be spending more
than $12 million to try to maintain what we have and possibly get a
steal or two," Wesson said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, the Assembly's GOP leader, Dave Cox of Fair
Oaks, who expects to be outspent, said Republicans would "spend as
much as is necessary" to protect three open GOP seats and perhaps
sneak up on Democrats in as many as five other districts.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of things could happen," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, where the census produced one more California seat
to bring the delegation to 53, political mapmakers aimed to see that
the Republican ranks stay at 20 and that the added seat, the 39th
District in southeastern Los Angeles County, goes to a Latino
Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Labor leader Linda Sanchez, sister of Rep. Loretta Sanchez
(D-Garden Grove), is widely expected to win the seat this fall.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the Central Valley's 18th District seat that is drawing
the most attention -- and money and other help from national leaders
in both major parties. The race is one of a handful around the nation
that could help determine which party controls the narrowly divided
House of Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Condit (D-Ceres), tainted by the scandal surrounding his
relationship with murdered intern Chandra Levy, lost the primary to
Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza of Merced, his onetime aide. Republicans
nominated state Sen. Richard Monteith of Modesto and mounted a big
voter registration drive that cut into the Democrats' edge.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders and stars from both parties have visited the district to
raise money and stump for their candidates. Cardoza attracted former
Vice President Al Gore, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) Democratic National
Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe walked precincts with him.</TE>
<TE>   Monteith drew help from House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.),
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) and Secretary of Agriculture
Ann M. Veneman, and got time -- and photographs -- with President
Bush during a Bush visit.</TE>
<TE>   In state Senate races, the one hot contest is being waged between
Democrat Rusty Areias of Merced, a former assemblyman who resigned as
state parks director to run, and a Salinas factory owner, Jeff
Denham, a Republican. The winner will succeed Monteith.</TE>

the district, but the gap has narrowed slightly as Republicans have

<TE>   This race is considered the only real contest for a state Senate

<LD>Los Angeles voters face a historic choice Nov. 5: whether to break
apart the nation's second-largest city and create an independent San
Fernando Valley and Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Residents throughout Los Angeles County, meanwhile, will be asked
to decide the fate of several measures seeking millions of dollars
for an array of educational, cultural and medical institutions.</LD>
<LD>   Measure A would fund safety upgrades at aging county museums;
another proposal, Measure B, would help maintain the county's
troubled network of hospital emergency rooms. To pass, both proposals
need approval by two-thirds of county voters.</LD>
<TE>   Measure K, a $3.3-billion construction bond, would help the
swelling Los Angeles Unified School District build new schools and
renovate old ones. It requires a 55% majority vote.</TE>
<TE>   And in Santa Monica, voters will weigh in on a ballot initiative
to increase the pay for employees who work primarily for luxury
hotels along the beach. The so-called living wage ordinance is being
closely watched nationwide because it would be the first of its kind
to regulate wages paid by private employers who are not operating on
city property or under city contract.</TE>
<TE>   In the Valley, secessionists struggled for six years to push what
became Measure F onto the ballot. Their unlikely campaign overcame
many hurdles -- changing state law to allow citywide secession votes
and collecting thousands of signatures to force a $2-million study of
the breakup's financial impact -- but the biggest obstacle lies
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   To win, secessionists need to claim a majority of voters citywide
and in the Valley. A recent Times poll shows that Los Angeles' likely
voters oppose a breakup by 2 to 1. The secession proposal was
trailing even in the Valley, 47% to 42%, a gap within the poll's
margin of error.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secession has also failed to attract widespread support,
according to the poll. Only 21% of likely voters citywide favor
Measure H, while 60% oppose it. "Most of us feel that it's going down
to defeat ... but the issue is not going to go away," said Jaime
Regalado, director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at
Cal State L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that there has been a pro-secession campaign, even
though it hasn't been very well run, nevertheless created a new level
of respect," he said. Secessionists "have made a credible case that
there has been a disconnect between a good part of some communities
and the structure of their government."</TE>
<TE>   If approved by voters, the new Valley city would be born July 1.
With 1.35 million people and 222 square miles, it would be bigger
than Phoenix, San Diego and Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley would be governed by an elected mayor and 14 council
members. Voters who live in the Valley will be asked to choose those
leaders as well as a new name for the proposed city.</TE>
<TE>   For at least its first year of independence, the Valley would
remain closely bound to the city it left, relying on Los Angeles for
virtually every municipal service. The Valley city would have a
$1.2-million budget -- and most of it would go to paying L.A. for
police and fire protection, garbage pickup, park maintenance and
other services.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, however, the fledgling city could set up its own
departments or contract with Los Angeles County or private vendors to
provide services.</TE>
<TE>   Fiscal Impact of a Split</TE>
<TE>   Because state law requires that municipal breakups be "revenue
neutral" -- in other words, they can't financially harm either the
new city or the one left behind -- the Local Agency Formation
Commission had to calculate secession's fiscal impact.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO found that Los Angeles collects $127.1 million more from
Valley taxpayers each year than it gives back in city services,
bolstering secessionists' belief that the Valley isn't getting its
fair share.</TE>
<TE>   The remedy, however, would be for the Valley to pay that amount to
Los Angeles after a breakup to compensate L.A. for the loss. The
so-called alimony payment would drop 5% annually over 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley city would keep all police stations, libraries and
other assets within its boundaries. LAFCO also decided that the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power would provide utilities to the
Valley at the same rates it charges L.A. customers. But Los Angeles
officials argue that LAFCO doesn't have the authority to enforce such
a mandate and suggest that the matter could wind up in court.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city, would lose a third
of its residents and nearly half its land in the breakup to become
the third-largest city, behind New York and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The city would have to redraw its council districts and hold new
elections. But since Los Angeles would retain control of its water
and power systems, airports and other assets, most residents would
probably detect few immediate changes.</TE>
<TE>   In the long term, however, the city would face the loss of
substantial tax revenue. After 20 years, Los Angeles would no longer
collect the Valley's alimony payment. Secession opponents contend
that a breakup could also cost thousands of city employees their
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The bid for Hollywood secession piggybacked on the Valley
movement's advances -- with the help of a rich nightclub owner who
wants to become Hollywood's first mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Valley effort, which was fueled by years of hard work
and donations from hundreds of Valley residents, the Hollywood
campaign is largely the brainchild of one man: Gene La Pietra, owner
of the popular gay clubs Arena Cafe and Circus Disco on Santa Monica
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra has contributed more than $2 million so far toward
Hollywood independence, including about $700,000 to get the measure
on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Secession backers say the new cities would trim the fat from local
government, making police, fire, sanitation and other services more
efficient and responsive. Council districts would be smaller,
theoretically giving residents a louder voice at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents -- a well-funded coalition of business moguls, union
members, politicians and lobbyists -- argue that a breakup could
endanger public safety and hurt city finances. They emphasize
secession's many uncertainties, pointing out that there are no
long-term guarantees about how the new cities would handle everything
from rent control to disaster response.</TE>
<TE>   Secession would have no impact on the Los Angeles Unified School
District. But separatists say a new Valley city would have so much
clout that, down the road, it could push for a school district
breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Although secession would leave L.A. Unified untouched, the
November ballot includes two bond measures that would help the
overcrowded district build more schools.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds for Schools</TE>
<TE>   The construction bonds -- a $13-billion statewide measure and a
separate $3.3-billion proposal for L.A. Unified -- would fund new
university and kindergarten-through-12th-grade school buildings,
expansions and renovations. Passage of the state bond measure,
Proposition 47, requires a simple majority, while the local bond
item, Measure K, needs a 55% vote.</TE>
<TE>   Like many local districts around the state, L.A. Unified plans to
match potential funds from the state bond with local bond proceeds.
The money would help finish building 80 new campuses and 79
expansions begun with funds from previous school bond issues. It
would also start 40 new school projects to ease overcrowding and get
students off buses and into neighborhood schools.</TE>
<TE>   If the local bond measure passes, it will raise annual property
taxes within the district by about $60 per $100,000 of assessed
value. For an owner of a $250,000 house, that means $150 a year for
30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Residents throughout the county will be asked to vote on two other
funding measures. Measure A would pay for earthquake and fire safety
improvements at county-owned science and cultural institutions,
including the Natural History Museum and the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, with a blend of private and public dollars.</TE>
<TE>   It would allow the county to issue $250 million in bonds to fund
upgrades at eight locations -- but only if another $250 million were
raised first through private donations.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would also help build new projects such as a cultural
arts complex in El Pueblo de Los Angeles historic district and a
performing arts center at Cal State Northridge. It would cost the
owner of a $250,000 home an estimated $6.96 the first year and $6.04
the second. That amount would continue to decline if real estate
assessments increased.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B is aimed at shoring up the county's shrinking network of
hospital emergency rooms. It would levy a parcel tax of 3 cents per
square foot on homes, office buildings and other developed
properties.</TE>
<TE>   The $168 million raised would help fund county trauma centers,
emergency medical services and bioterrorism response.</TE>
<TE>   County officials estimate that the tax would cost the owner of an
average 1,400-square-foot home $42.66 annually.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Monica, meanwhile, voters will consider a groundbreaking
living wage law that would boost the pay of housekeepers, busboys and
other low-wage workers who are concentrated in the luxury hotels in
the city's booming coastal tourism zone.</TE>
<TE>   Under the ordinance, businesses with more than $5 million in
annual sales would have to pay workers at least $10.50 an hour with
health benefits or $12.25 without. That would provide enough money
for a family of four to get off food stamps, proponents say.</TE>
<TE>   After years of debate, the City Council passed the ordinance last
year. But it never took effect; opponents collected enough signatures
to force a voter referendum on the issue. The initiative, Measure JJ,
asks voters to decide whether they want the law enacted.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the measure would chill the business climate. Posh
hotels along the coast have spent about $1.8 million over the last
three years to defeat the ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   But religious and community leaders and more than 100 labor
economists across the nation have voiced support for Measure JJ,
saying it would provide significant benefits for workers without
imposing an undue burden on businesses.</TE>

<LD>Nine o'clock in the morning in the emergency room at Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center near Torrance, and the lame, fevered, hacking masses
wait for their names to be called on the loudspeaker.</LD>
<LD>   "Sir, it is a minimum five-hour wait to see a doctor," an
attendant tells an exasperated man who feebly protests the delay.</LD>
<LD>   In the crowd of two dozen patients, a young man sits near me,
crutches at his side, an ankle in a cast propped up on a chair.</LD>
<TE>   He says he was unaware the hospital could be shut down soon,
ostensibly to save the collapsing L.A. County health system.</TE>
<TE>   "So you broke your leg?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "No," says Sedric Solomon, 22. "I got shot."</TE>
<TE>   "You got shot before or after you got the cast?"</TE>
<TE>   Solomon -- a construction worker with no health insurance, like
half the people here -- tells the story:</TE>
<TE>   He goes to buy some milk at a shop near Florence Avenue and
Normandie, and walks out into a blazing gun battle. He starts
running, and goes down from a bullet that goes in one side of his
calf and out the other, breaking a bone.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to MLK," Solomon says of Martin Luther King Jr./Drew
Medical Center, another overburdened county hospital. "It took three
hours before they saw me, then it took another six for them to do
this. After that I just got up and left. If it's going to hurt, it
can hurt at home."</TE>
<TE>   It hurt too much, though. This time Solomon figured he'd try
Harbor-UCLA, and see if they could look at his gunshot wound in under
three hours.</TE>
<TE>   The clock is ticking. For Solomon, and for the hospital, which
shuttles chairs from one unit to another each day, because there
aren't enough to go around.</TE>
<TE>   I look around the room, which is thick with discomfort, and the
whole scene is an indictment of American health care.</TE>
<TE>   About 250 people a day walk into Harbor-UCLA for emergency or
urgent health care. But many of them -- Sedric Solomon and his bullet
hole excluded -- really have no business being here. They should be
at a doctor's office, getting the kind of treatment that keeps them
from ending up at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   But in many cases they have no doctors, no insurance, and nowhere
else to go but to this catch basin.</TE>
<TE>   Whom to blame?</TE>
<TE>   You can start with federal officials, who dropped the ball on
health care reform and turned the business of medicine over to
insurance executives and accountants. You can point a finger at state
and local officials too, who are pros when it comes to blaming
everything on the feds, but not so sharp when it comes to actually
doing something.</TE>
<TE>   And you can always blame politics.</TE>
<TE>   Bickering L.A. County supervisors, who have already shuttered 11
clinics, could vote as early as Tuesday to kill the lights at
Harbor-UCLA and Olive View-UCLA Medical Centers because of a huge
projected budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Late last week, it looked as if the vote might be postponed. Some
folks argued that the timing of the vote, and perhaps even the threat
of hospital closures, was designed to draw support for Measure B,
which would raise $175 million a year to keep the county's trauma
centers in business.</TE>
<TE>   Look, we know the game. It's no surprise that everyone in this
thing, from politicians, to doctors, to nurses unions, to
pharmaceutical companies, to hospitals, to county health care
administrators, to insurance agents, has an agenda.</TE>
<TE>   But the patient is barely on anyone's radar screen, and often gets
stiffed in the end. Particularly the poor, and the growing legions of
those with jobs but no insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "About 40 to 50% of the people who come through the door have
nothing in the way of insurance, nada," Harbor-UCLA medical director
Dr. Gail Anderson Jr. tells me in the wings of the emergency room of
a teaching hospital he is eminently proud of, given its mission of
turning away no one.</TE>
<TE>   With county clinics already closed, the nearest hospitals wouldn't
be able to handle the increased load caused by a Harbor-UCLA
shutdown, Anderson says.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not just a concern for patients from the Harbor area, he
adds. If you happen to have a heart attack on the San Diego Freeway,
this is the only full-service trauma center between LAX and the
Orange County line, so say a prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B will help. But it's a Band-Aid, not a cure, and as the
population continues to explode, we'll need a Measure B-Plus.</TE>
<TE>   One more obvious long-term solution, here and nationwide, is
universal health care.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm amazed that neither party has made it a priority," Anderson
says.</TE>
<TE>   I wish I could say the same.</TE>
<TE>   In the emergency walk-in center, Sedric Solomon has finally been
called to have his bullet hole looked at. Celia Huerta, 52, a
diabetic from Compton, is waiting to be seen for arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   Like Solomon, she went to MLK last time and it took hours. She
says they told her she might be better off at Harbor-UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "They said I'd wait, though. They said I should bring breakfast,
lunch and dinner with me."</TE>

<HD>10 Seek Job That May Amount to Nothing</HD>
<DH>Diverse field of Valley mayoral candidates is fighting over
a post that would pay little and won't exist unless secession is
approved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 10 candidates for San Fernando Valley mayor have spent hundreds
of hours and thousands of dollars running for an office that would
pay only $12,000 a year and won't even exist if voters reject
secession on Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Mostly unknown and inexperienced, the candidates have carried a
double burden: communicating their own vision for the Valley to
voters who have shown little interest, and promoting Valley cityhood
itself.</LD>
<LD>   Getting their message out to 1.3 million Valley residents has been
difficult. Even the better-funded candidates have little money for
the campaign. They say prospective financial backers have been
frightened off by the fact that the winner of the mayor's race won't
have an office to hold unless voters approve secession.</LD>
<TE>   "It's certainly an uphill battle, but we are all working hard out
there to bring the truth to the voters," said Assemblyman Keith
Richman (R-Northridge), the best-financed candidate and only elected
official in the race. He had raised $127,000 as of Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Despite polls showing Valley secession faces long odds, Richman
and some of the other candidates have developed detailed plans for
improving police and fire protection, cutting business taxes,
streamlining bureaucracy, solving problems and reforming the school
system.</TE>
<TE>   Their specific proposals range from expanding the police force by
hundreds of officers -- something they all agree on -- to providing
universal health care for Valley children and Internet service for
all Valley residents.</TE>
<TE>   The field of candidates is almost as diverse as the Valley. It
includes two Latinos, an African American and a Filipino American.</TE>
<TE>   The overarching theme of the mayoral campaigns is that Los Angeles
is too big and that it has not given the Valley a fair share of
services. Only a Valley city, with its own mayor and city council,
can make things right, the candidates say.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign had been free of fireworks until recently, when
Richman came under attack for simultaneously seeking reelection to
the state Assembly. Richman has said he will give up his Assembly
seat if secession wins and he is elected mayor.</TE>
<TE>   A Times poll this month indicated that Richman, a 48-year-old
physician, was the front-runner but that the race was wide open.
Richman was ahead with just 13% support from likely voters, the poll
found. Two-thirds of the voters had not decided which candidate to
back.</TE>
<TE>   Richman has a five-point plan for a Valley city that includes more
police hiring and creation of a boroughs system.</TE>
<TE>   "Public safety is the No. 1 concern on people's minds," said
Richman, who would start off by expanding the police force in the
Valley by 30%, or 500 officers.</TE>
<TE>   Richman also would set up seven boroughs in the Valley, each of
which would elect five commissioners to make local decisions. If
secession passes, the Valley would also have a 14-member City
Council.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other mayoral candidates, only Mel Wilson has much of a
public profile. The 49-year-old Northridge resident is past president
of the Valley Board of Realtors and current general manager of the
Woodland Hills and Calabasas offices of Re/Max, the realty firm.</TE>
<TE>   A former pro football player, Wilson has also served on the city
Fire Commission and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, who was second in fund-raising, with $45,000 as of the
beginning of this month, said one of his top priorities as mayor
would be to lobby Sacramento to create a Valley school district.</TE>
<TE>   "Only 55% of our kids are graduating from the LAUSD. That's not
acceptable. That's a tragedy," Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   He also wants to make sure there are two paramedics on each shift
in each Valley fire station. Shifts in some stations now have one or
no paramedics, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a Democrat, Wilson says he is more in tune with the Valley,
where Democrats hold an edge in voter registration, than is Richman,
a Republican. The mayor's office would be nonpartisan.</TE>
<TE>   Benito "Benny" Bernal is the candidate who wants a Valley city to
provide health care to an estimated 4,000 uninsured children.</TE>
<TE>   Children ages 6 to 12 would be eligible for the health program,
says Bernal, 38, of Mission Hills. He also wants the city to provide
preschool programs for all 4-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   "It would provide an opportunity to educate and prepare kids so
they are ready for kindergarten," Bernal said.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Strassman, 54, an Internet consultant from Valley Village,
proposes the Internet service for all residents as a way to get them
involved in city government. He says residents should cast votes via
the Web on critical matters before the city.</TE>
<TE>   Strassman also favors a "green" approach to government. "Instead
of running out of water and space and clean air, we should use solar
energy and recycling and telecommuting so we have a sustainable
economy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate David Hernandez, 54, says a Valley city should take over
Van Nuys Airport from Los Angeles. He also intends to focus on
setting up an efficient city government.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to ensure that it is not only a doable project on paper
but that in reality we can make it a viable city," said Hernandez,
who also is running for Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Boyer, a 41-year-old alarm company manager from Reseda, is
the only candidate who says the Valley city should not adopt Los
Angeles' rent-control laws. He says the laws violate property owners'
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Boyer also suggests that after secession the Valley should be
carved into 30 cities of 50,000 people each. In addition, he says a
Valley city should not make the annual separation payments to Los
Angeles required by the Local Agency Formation Commission, which
approved the secession proposal for the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should we pay extortion payments to Los Angeles?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Shapiro, an 83-year-old gadfly and newspaper columnist, is
running for mayor in part to eliminate the gross receipts tax paid by
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Divina, 63, a retired accountant from Chatsworth, says his
accounting skills would help a new city start on the right fiscal
footing.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Roberts, 52, a North Hollywood community activist, says he
would fight for a Valley light-rail system.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Summers, a 45-year-old Realtor associate from Granada Hills,
says he would reinstate the senior lead officer program for the
Valley police force, and would hire more civilians to ease officers'
paperwork burden.</TE>

<LD>For Shawna Brino, one of the hardest things about raising quadruplets
is managing the chaos. Like when her 4-year-olds taunt each other in
the backyard.</LD>
<LD>   "With three boys the same age [her fourth child is a girl], you
can imagine the dynamics," said Brino, who lives in the Antelope
Valley. "They feed off each other and do crazy things. One will say,
'Hey, I bet you can't jump off the swing set.' And the other ones
will try it."</LD>
<LD>   Bringing up triplets, quadruplets and quintuplets can be
incredibly challenging, says Brino and other parents of multiples.
And that is after enduring a pregnancy that can leave many women
debilitated, depressed and downright shellshocked.</LD>
<TE>   To help Southern California parents cope with some of these
issues, two suburban mothers of triplets -- one from Simi Valley, the
other from Lancaster -- founded a support group two years ago for
parents of multiples.</TE>
<TE>   Although parents of twins are welcome, the group is aimed at those
who have more than two at a time. At a recent meeting, all but one of
the parents had triplets, quads or quints.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Higher Order Multiples Support meet once a month in a
conference room at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills,
where the drama of their hectic lives unfolds as they trade
information and swap hand-me-downs.</TE>
<TE>   They also get some peace and quiet -- mothers leave the children
at home with dad on meeting nights, or they hire a sitter.</TE>
<TE>   The recent meeting began with announcements and a look back on the
group's popular summer picnic, which drew many television cameras.
Then co-founders D'Anne Fraye and Tracy Lujan divided the parents
into two groups.</TE>
<TE>   Those with school-age children sat on one side of the room, while
those whose babies and toddlers were too young to set foot in a
classroom sat on the other. Most in the latter group hung on every
word uttered by Dale Sua of Simi Valley, who raised her 19-year-old
triplet boys without benefit of support groups and Internet sites.</TE>
<TE>   "My boys were in the same classes through elementary school," Sua
told the moms and dads. "One year I agreed to separate them, but the
homework and class projects were overwhelming. And the field trips
... how many times do you want to go to the zoo?"</TE>
<TE>   Fraye and Lujan said they wanted to provide a comfortable, low-key
environment where parents could express their concerns and fears with
others who could relate to their frustrations.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you just need someplace where people don't look at you
like you're crazy," Brino said. "Parents of single children don't
understand."</TE>
<TE>   Although several national organizations hold annual conferences
and connect parents of multiples over the Internet, "you don't find
the nitty-gritty how-to's," Lujan said.</TE>
<TE>   While multiples were once rare, the U.S. multiple birth rate,
meaning three or more children born at once, soared from 37 live
births per 100,000 in 1980 to 194 live births per 100,000 in 1998.
The surge came as women who postponed childbirth turned to fertility
treatment to become pregnant. The rate has since tapered off to 181
per 100,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   As mothers carry three, four and five babies to term, they find
themselves increasingly isolated from a world largely inhabited by
singletons and twins, said Janet Blyle, a Stockton mother who founded
a national support group, the Triplet Connection, nearly 20 years ago
when her triplet boys were born.</TE>
<TE>   Its handbook on bearing and raising triplets is considered by many
parents to be the prime authority on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   "The issues are so unique, and no one else understands," Blyle
said. "It's wonderful that they [Fraye and Lujan] are doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Expectant parents of multiples face a host of serious health and
medical challenges, parents say, including:</TE>
<TE>   * Reduction. Many doctors and insurance companies recommend that
pregnant women reduce the number of fetuses they are carrying to one
or two to lessen the risk of complications -- and to avoid the high
cost of delivering multiples.</TE>
<TE>   * Bed rest. Obstetricians often order pregnant women with
multiples to stay in bed 24 hours a day to reduce the risk of early
labor caused by physical activity.</TE>
<TE>   * Medication. Doctors often prescribe medication to prevent early
labor. A common one is magnesium sulfate, whose side effects include
dizziness, blurry vision and loss of muscle control.</TE>
<TE>   * Premature birth. Multiple babies are usually born prematurely,
creating a host of medical complications. A team of specialists is
usually required to deliver them in a newborn intensive care unit.</TE>
<TE>   After the babies are born, parents are confronted with a new set
of questions, such as:</TE>
<TE>   * How do you I keep from becoming a shut-in because it's too much
of a production to take the kids out of the house? (Get a relative or
friend to help you, experts say. Once you are outside, avoid making
eye contact with strangers who might stop you with questions.)</TE>
<TE>   * How do you breast-feed three babies? (First two, then one.)</TE>
<TE>   * Where do you buy a stroller for triplets? (Order one from Italy;
the U.S.-made models are too flimsy, experts say.)</TE>
<TE>   * How does one parent load three babies into a car? (Gradually.)</TE>
<TE>   * How do you put three toddlers to bed at the same time? (It helps
to take everything out of the room except the beds to reduce
distractions.)</TE>
<TE>   Fraye, 37, of Simi Valley, and Lujan, 33, of Lancaster, met three
years ago through Sidelines, a national support group for women who
have to stay in bed during their pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Fraye was pregnant with triplets Mitchell, Garrett
and Spencer. She and her husband, Vern, also have an 8-year-old
daughter, Lindsey.</TE>
<TE>   Lujan and her husband, Jerry, have 6-year-old triplets --
daughters Shelby and Taylor, and son Jerry. The couple also have a
2-year-old son, Jeremy, and a 1-year-old daughter, Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   Fraye, whose longest stretch in the hospital was nine weeks before
delivery, said she felt like a prisoner the entire time. She wasn't
allowed to get up, even to shower.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I had been through hell," Fraye said. "Your whole
life is taken away from you."</TE>
<TE>   Lujan could relate. Thirty-four weeks and three days into her
pregnancy, ensconced at Kaiser Woodland Hills, she woke up in a
panic. Something didn't feel right.</TE>
<TE>   She pulled out her intravenous lines and demanded that doctors
induce labor right then and there.</TE>
<TE>   They did. And they learned that two of the babies' placentas had
fused together and stopped functioning.</TE>
<TE>   If Lujan hadn't "listened to her body," her babies probably would
have died, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here to show people who want triplets or quadruplets that
it can be done and you can have healthy babies," Lujan said.</TE>
<TE>   When Fraye and Lujan aren't cleaning up messes or fending off
disaster on the playground, they are driving their kids around Los
Angeles to various acting jobs.</TE>
<TE>   About 25% of the families in Higher Order Multiples Support have
children who work in show business, said Janis Brett-Elspas, a parent
of triplets who volunteers as a public relations specialist for the
group.</TE>
<TE>   Identical twins and triplets are in high demand by producers
because they can share a single role and work a 12-hour day between
them, said Fraye, who worked as a talent manager in the entertainment
industry before she became a full-time mom. Labor laws limit the
hours a child may work on a set to six a day.</TE>
<TE>   Fraye's triplets play character Zach Brady on the TV soap opera
"Days of Our Lives," and Lujan's trio recently wrapped up six days on
the set of an Eddie Murphy movie.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Brino's quadruplets -- Lorenzo, Zachary, Nikolas and
Myrinda -- play twins Sam and David on TV's "Seventh Heaven."</TE>
<TE>   "Many of us are financially borderline, so it's a tremendous
opportunity to be able to make some money and put it away for
college," Fraye said.</TE>
<TE>   Lujan and Fraye, who are friends as well as partners, hope to keep
Higher Order Multiples Support going indefinitely, because it serves
a purpose among a growing number of parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone who walks through that door," Lujan said, "understands
my life."</TE>

<HD>Itinerant Nurses Fill Growing Shortages at State's
Hospitals</HD>
<DH>Institutions must use an expanding industry or turn
patients away. For nurses, benefits range from higher pay to rental
cars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Pogash</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>The blond, pony-tailed nurse bustled her way through the relatives to
the patient's bedside: "How y'all doing today?"</LD>
<LD>   "Y'all"? In Berkeley?</LD>
<LD>   But for the Southern accents and the "y'alls" heard in California
hospitals, patients might not know of the migration of nurses from
the South to large states like California, and New York.Like
thousands of other nurses, Courtney Carruba, who had never been out
of the South, is taking advantage of a national nursing shortage.</LD>
<TE>   Having temporarily left her husband, an operating room supervisor,
back in Birmingham, Ala., Carruba and her sister have done stints in
Merced, Oakland, Chico and Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   On her days off, she races to Lassen National Park, Lake Tahoe,
Monterey or Santa Cruz, which she did after an all-night shift,
hitting the beach on no sleep. Having accumulated a lot of loans
while in nursing school, the 27-year-old Carruba uses the fatter
paycheck to pay them back. In Alabama, she made $19 an hour. In
Northern California she earns $30 to $40 an hour. If she headed for
Los Angeles, she could make $34 to $43 an hour with the largest
company in the business, AMN Healthcare Services. In this burgeoning
industry, traveling nurse companies can offer furnished apartments in
safe neighborhoods, utilities, health clubs, travel expenses, rental
cars, 401(k)s and health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   With an estimated 126,000 nursing jobs going unfilled in the
country, and the prospect of that number doubling in 10 years,
traveling nurses -- as well as traveling health-care workers such as
X-ray technicians -- is a growth industry.</TE>
<TE>   Cross Country Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., is on NASDAQ; AMN
Healthcare Services of San Diego, which went public one year ago and
has an estimated 35% to 40% of the market, is traded on the New York
Stock Exchange. Its success is based on the premise, expressed by its
chief executive officer, Steve Francis, that "it's good to have a
nurse rather than a bed not staffed, because there's no revenue
coming out of a bed not staffed." The choice is that simple:
Hospitals can either hire traveling nurses (or even more costly per
diem nurses) or turn patients away. Some nights at Enloe Hospital in
Chico, Carruba said, the only other people she worked with were
traveling nurses. The agency that hired her, On Assignment Inc. of
Calabasas, draws the bulk of its traveling nurses from the South,
where salaries are much lower.</TE>
<TE>   And how does a hospital's permanent staff feel about the
travelers? Scott Meyerson, an Alta Bates Medical Center critical care
nurse, is far from threatened: "You have a pulse? Wow. You want to
work? We're thrilled."</TE>
<TE>   "We know if we don't have them," said Denise Navellier, patient
care manager at the hospital, "then we don't have anyone."</TE>
<TE>   However, the California Nurses Assn., representing 45,000
registered nurses, believes that quality can be eroded if a hospital
staff is not stable.</TE>
<TE>   When the nurses know the staff, the policies and procedures of a
hospital, said spokesman Charles Idelson, "the atmosphere is more
conducive to reducing medical errors and enhancing the general
environment for patient care." Using regularly scheduled staff rather
than traveling nurses "is more cost effective and more care
effective."</TE>
<TE>   With 585 registered nurses per 100,000 people, California ranks
49th in the 50 states -- only Nevada has a lower ratio, according to
Jan Emerson, vice president of external affairs for the California
Healthcare Assn. Massachusetts is at the top, with 1,190 nurses per
100,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   With the average California nurse now 47 years old and thinking of
retirement, and with state-mandated patient-nurse ratios for all
units of all hospitals to take effect in 2004, the shortage will
grow.</TE>
<TE>   By 2010, Emerson said, the state will need an additional 109,000
nurses, according to the state Economic Development Department. None
of the University of California campuses offers a degree in nursing,
and the University of Southern California recently closed its
program, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nursing programs did not bring it academic prestige," Emerson
said. (A USC spokeswoman said the program was too costly and couldn't
compete with less expensive programs offered by community colleges.)</TE>
<TE>   Traveling nurses are likely to be essential for meeting required
ratios. But the costs are significant.</TE>
<TE>   For the traveling nurses, the offers can be irresistible.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't unions in Texas," said Annjeanette "Angi" Domasig.
After 11 years in Dallas, where she earned $21 an hour at most, she's
working for 13 weeks in Berkeley, where she earns $28 an hour and
receives a free apartment. The cost of paying a traveling nurse $28
an hour plus the added benefits an agency provides can cost a
California hospital from $48 to more than $110 an hour, according to
Ginnie Kosmin, manager of patient care resources at Alta Bates
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   That can be two to three times as much as permanent nurses cost at
a time "when 66% of California hospitals are currently operating in
the red," Emerson said.</TE>

<HD>Never-Say-Die Makes It a Tie</HD>
<DH>Angel fans watched with dread as the Giants ran up a 5-zip
lead. Then the Angels struck back.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angels fans throughout Orange County thanked God and the rally monkey
Saturday night as the team came from behind to tie the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   From the mall to the barstool to the living room Barcalounger,
fans rode a sometimes-nauseating wave of excitement as Anaheim staged
a pulse-quickening rally to beat the San Francisco Giants 6-5,
setting up a seventh climactic game today.</LD>
<LD>   While many hard core Angels fans watched most of the game in a
state of dread, the memory of Thursday night's drubbing fresh in
their memories, a late inning rally sent their spirits soaring.</LD>
<TE>   "You don't turn off an Angels game until the last swing," crowed
Anaheim fan Tom Milowicki, 45, who watched the game at the Huddle, in
Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unreal. I had an asthma attack," said fan Heather Pone, who
watched in her parents' Anaheim living room. Pone, 28, who arranged
her wedding plans around the Angels' game schedule and drives a Dodge
Neon with the license plate, "HALOFAN," said she tuned in with
butterflies in her stomach.</TE>
<TE>   She said that despite a lot of long faces around her when the
score was 5-zip in favor of the Giants, she never gave up hope.
"We've come back from more. This is a team you just don't give up
on."</TE>
<TE>   Others were not as steely.</TE>
<TE>   "In the sixth inning, I was pretty shaky," said Todd Edette, 32.
He was hoarse from shouting over the din at Oggi's Pizza and Brewing
Company in Mission Viejo. "I thought they'd blow it again at the last
minute. I'm kind of afraid for Game 7."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a stone's throw from UC Irvine, the Steelhead Brewing
Company attracted a more international crowd whose loyalties were
clearly divided.</TE>
<TE>   A gaggle of MBA students who gathered at the brewery in one of
their monthly mixers quickly found themselves in debate.</TE>
<TE>   "Loosen up all you Angels' band-wagoneers, the Giants rule,"
bellowed Giants' fan Tommy Nguyen, 28, of Modesto. Nguyen, who said
he had two golf games and two cases of beer riding on the series
outcome, drew increasingly irritated stares from others at the bar
during the early innings.</TE>
<TE>   Classmate Ali Mozayeni, 25, of Newport Beach, jeered Nguyen. "Send
him back to NoCal," he shouted. Although Mozayeni said he'd been an
Angel's fan for all of three weeks, he said his bond with the team
was solid. "Listen, listen, if your hometown is in the World Series,
you support them."</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen, who grew louder and giddier as the game progressed, turned
ecstatic when Giants home-run king Barry Bonds slammed one out of the
park in the sixth inning. "Those Angels fans are going to be pulling
out their Giants hats."</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the room fell silent.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Todd Holbrook, 31, sat impassively, his back to a nearby
television set. A die-hard Yankees fan from Tenafly, N.J., Holbrook
cast a sour eye on the spectacle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's two loser teams fighting it out for nothing," he said. "The
next season starts April first."</TE>
<TE>   The dynamics of the game and the mood of the bar shifted abruptly
in the seventh inning, when Angel Scott Spiezio knocked a three-run
homer into right field. At Edison International field, spectators
began dancing in the aisles.</TE>
<TE>   They never stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "From having nothing to having everything is incredible,'' said
John Lologo of Irvine. "There's really no reason for the Giants to
show up tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Just before the Angels' offensive explosion, a Yankee fan ripped
the head off a stuffed Rally Monkey and threw it at a group of Angels
fans. Andy Kerr, 27, of Aliso Viejo, caught it. He never let go.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, I kept it in my left hand. And they've scored six
runs. Don't mess with the monkey."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at the Shops at Mission Viejo, Angel fans learned
developments by word of mouth.</TE>
<TE>   In the early innings, as the Giants widened their lead, Dale
Ferbert, 36, found himself without a television and surrounded by
people in Halloween costumes at The Picture People, a photography
studio.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather be at home, frankly," said Ferbert, as he adjusted a
flowing gold wig. "I was told I had to come."</TE>
<TE>   Ferbert, his wife, Loran, 35, and their two children were dressed
as Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Despite Ferbert's desire to watch
the game at home, his family had decided that the sixth game of the
World Series wasn't going to stop them from having their annual
Halloween picture taken.</TE>
<TE>   Told that the Angels were falling farther and farther behind,
Loran Ferbert said she had already braced herself for what was to
come. "We already have disappointment," Ferbert said of the Angels'
loss Thursday night. "There was nothing we could do. We were hoping
they'd win that night."</TE>
<TE>   Not all the action Saturday was on the baseball field. A pilot
towing a banner advertising the Knott's Berry Farm theme park above
Edison Field was forced to make an emergency landing on a street --
in traffic -- when his Cessna 150 lost fuel pressure.</TE>
<TE>   No one was injured when Martin Eckman, 61, touched his
single-engine craft down in the 1200 block of North Kraemer Avenue.
"It was a nice road, not a whole lot of traffic on it," Eckman said.</TE>
<TE>   But the unexpected touchdown was just the kind of incident Anaheim
police had in mind when they tried to convince federal aviation
officials to ban banner-toting aircraft from over the stadium during
the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "We're responsible for the security at the stadium, and that
doesn't stop on the ground," said Sgt. Rick Martinez. "It's safe to
say, we were all very lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Eckman, who identified himself as an Angels fan, said he has towed
banners over the stadium dfor 20 years without any problems.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, the forced landing gave Eckman his first opportunity
in years to watch the conclusion of the game live.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Voters Face Tough Races, Bond Issues</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County voters on Nov. 5 will consider potentially historic
change at Santa Ana City Hall, more than $804 million in school bond
measures and a host of other decisions that will affect everything
from their tax bills to the location of the next South County Home
Depot.</LD>
<LD>   Mayors in Irvine, Garden Grove and Westminster are seeking
reelection, and in Anaheim a former state lawmaker and two council
members are competing in a tough mayoral race. Voters in Irvine will
decide whether to repeal a utility tax and voters in San Juan
Capistrano will decide whether to clear the way for a 175-home
development and high school.</LD>
<LD>   Here are some of the top races and issues voters will decide on
election day:</LD>
<TE>   Santa Ana City Council: Three Seats</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Ana, where 76% of the population is Latino, voters for
the first time could elect a Latino majority on the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Four Latinos are among the 10 candidates competing for three seats
on the council. The winners will join incumbents Claudia C. Alvarez,
Jose Solorio, Brett Franklin and Mayor Miguel A. Pulido, who is
running unopposed in his bid for a third term.</TE>
<TE>   In Ward 2, in central Santa Ana, incumbent Lisa Bist faces
challenger and political newcomer Jose Macias. Bist, 43, has focused
on neighborhood improvements and code enforcement during her first
term. She also supported downtown renovation and the Artists Village.
Macias, a 25-year-old graduate of San Diego State, quit his job as a
sales representative to run for office and wants to see more
low-income housing and after-school programs, plus library
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   In Ward 4, the west-central part of Santa Ana, challenger Zeke
Hernandez is trying to unseat incumbent Alberta Dolores Christy.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, 56, is president of Santa Ana's chapter of the League
of United Latin American Citizens. He says he wants to cut wasteful
spending and increase funding for roads, parks and recreation.</TE>
<TE>   Christy, 57, said she will continue her focus on public safety and
neighborhood improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Six candidates are in the running for the seat representing Ward
6, which covers the southeast portion of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana development planner Mike Garcia, 30, said he knows how
city government works. He is campaigning for stronger public safety,
additional redevelopment and after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   Eleazar Elizondo, 30, ran unsuccessfully for county supervisor in
2000, getting 25,000 votes. The public-affairs consultant wants the
city to have more after-school and day-care programs.</TE>
<TE>   Also running in Ward 6 is Jennifer Villasenor, 24, a planner for
the city of Rosemead who says she also supports after-school
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Robert L. Henson Sr., 68, is a retired aerospace worker and
community activist who wants to see improved road conditions and a
crackdown on city code violations, vagrancy and prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Fiala, 56, is the founder of EON, a company that seeks to
stop the aging process. He said the city needs to move in a new
direction and wants to make drug rehabilitation a law-enforcement
priority.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Jeanne Flindt, a 42-year-old office manager, said the
city needs to improve Santa Ana's image, its roads, sidewalks and
soccer fields.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Unified School District: Ethnic Politics Emerge as
Latino Leaders Battle</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Ana, a city with one of the nation's highest
concentrations of Latinos, ethnic politics and a smoldering battle
between the city's most influential Latino leaders have laced this
year's campaign for school board.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees John Palacio and Nadia Maria Davis are among eight
candidates running for two seats.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of the fiery campaign is a board member who's not on
the ballot: Nativo Lopez, who is midway through his second term and
the target of an ongoing recall campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, Palacio and Davis are viewed by many as strong allies on
the board, and their detractors accuse them of race-baiting by
labeling any opposition to their policies--whether it be over
bilingual education or where to build schools--as an attack on Latino
working families.</TE>
<TE>   The three say those charges are untrue, and describe themselves as
politically independent community leaders who have some common
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Challenger Robert Munoz, a social worker, said he finds the ethnic
politics repulsive, and said the board needs to look at the city as a
whole. Including Munoz, four of the six challengers are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates for the board are retired teacher Nina C.
Brazelton; former school board member Audrey Y. Noji, a college
administrator; parent activist Roland Lujan; and city library
commissioners Oscar Garza and Lupe Moreno.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim: 2 Insiders, 2 Outsiders Seek Mayor's Office</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim, four candidates are vying to replace Mayor Tom Daly,
who is leaving office after 10 years because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   Two are City Hall insiders: council members Frank Feldhaus, 74,
and Lucille Kring, 59. Two are outsiders: former Assembly Speaker
Curt Pringle, 43, and former La Habra Police Chief Steve Staveley,
58.</TE>
<TE>   The city they hope to lead for the next four years is a vastly
different place than when Daly was first elected mayor in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1990 and 2000, the population of Orange County's
second-largest city soared 23% on the strength of booming Latino and
Asian communities that now dominate Anaheim's ethnic makeup.</TE>
<TE>   After a massive revitalization that modernized Anaheim's core
tourist district, the candidates say the city has a variety of needs
in its diverse neighborhoods -- which range from aging, poor areas on
the west side to new, upscale developments in Anaheim Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council has approved a new police station, gym and
community center on Beach Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   In the planning stages are a new main library, a library for East
Anaheim and a Tiger Woods Foundation education center for
underprivileged children.</TE>
<TE>   What else will be done -- and where -- will be among the issues
the next mayor will face.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the City Council approved a five-year,
$583-million capital improvement fund for a slate of public
improvements ranging from community centers and parks to road and
sewer upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven candidates are seeking Feldhaus' and Kring's at-large seats
on the council: Richard Chavez, Steve Eichler, Robert J. Flores, Bob
Hernandez, John Koos, Bobby McDonald, James Mills, Stefanie O'Neill,
Manny Ontiveros, Harry Sidhu and Bob Zemel.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine: Two Competing Slates and One Independent</TE>
<TE>   Irvine is home to a highly charged election pitting Mayor Larry
Agran and his political allies against a more conservative slate of
mayoral and council candidates pushing to cut taxes and city spending
and derail plans for a light-rail line.</TE>
<TE>   Agran, who helped lead the campaign to kill the proposed El Toro
airport and instead build a "Great Park" on the closed Marine base,
is being challenged by former City Commissioner Mike House.</TE>
<TE>   House, a local businessman who also opposed the airport, said
Irvine's quality of life has been threatened by what he calls
missteps by the city, including the Agran-backed Orange County
Centerline light-rail proposal that would link Irvine and Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   House is running on a slate -- called "New Priorities" -- that
includes council candidates Christina L. Shea, a former Irvine mayor,
and aerospace executive Chuck DeVore.</TE>
<TE>   Agran belongs to a rival slate that includes incumbent Beth Krom
and council candidate Mitch Goldstone.</TE>
<TE>   Also running for a council seat is Irvine businesswoman Linda Lee
Grau, who is touting her independence from the political fray and
says she will bring a common-sense business approach to making City
Hall more efficient.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Agran and Krom voted in favor of a scaled-down
Centerline plan, and also voted to put the issue before voters by
June 30. The project has been attacked by House, Shea and DeVore, who
oppose construction of the light-rail line through Irvine
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Grau is the leading proponent of Measure GG, a local ballot
initiative to repeal Irvine's tax on telephone, electricity and
natural gas services. The 1.5% tax is imposed only on for-profit
businesses in Irvine, and has a $5,000 yearly cap. The tax will
generate an estimated $3.6 million in city revenue for the current
fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Grau argues the tax handicaps Irvine businesses that compete with
companies outside the city, and ultimately forces those businesses to
pass on the tax on to customers. House, Shea and DeVore also favor
Measure GG.</TE>
<TE>   Agran and his supporters are against the measure, saying it will
cut city revenue and could force budget cuts for law enforcement,
parks, roads and services for seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove: Focus on Redevelopment</TE>
<TE>   The Garden Grove mayor's race has vacillated from nasty to
bizarre, with two candidates suing each other over an allegation of
criminal wrongdoing and a third candidate who goes by the name "Will
B. King" and likes to wear a cardboard crown.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Bruce A. Broadwater is running for his fifth straight term
and has been one of Garden Grove's strongest advocates for
revitalization and redevelopment, so much so that he is known as the
"Bulldozer." One of the projects Broadwater supported would have
added hotels and an entertainment center on Harbor Boulevard, which
would have increased the city's tax revenue but also would have
forced 1,000 families to relocate. The council voted to reduce the
proposal in the face of growing community opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Broadwater is being challenged by Anthony Joseph Flores, a former
policeman who lost his job with the city's police force in 1988.
Flores, now a workers' compensation agent and PTA member, has been a
vocal critic of Broadwater's redevelopment projects, saying someone
needs to stand up for residents and property owners.</TE>
<TE>   Flores filed a defamation suit against Broadwater in August,
alleging the mayor called him a "felon" during a private City Hall
meeting with a constituent. Broadwater countersued last month.</TE>
<TE>   The third candidate is Will B. King, who is also known as William
Beckingham.</TE>
<TE>   King, who describes himself as the nation's biggest gadfly, made
headlines in 1995 when he was removed from the courtroom of O.J.
Simpson's murder trial while dressed in women's clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, he was convicted of threatening his former wife's
fiance with a toy bomb, but the conviction was later overturned. King
has called his opponents "maggots."</TE>
<TE>   Countywide: A Bruising Contest for Judicial Office</TE>
<TE>   A countywide judicial race that was born amid controversy and
scandal is finishing the same way.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Kline dropped his reelection bid for Judicial Office No. 21
after being charged with molesting a teenager and downloading child
pornography. Competing to succeed him are two local lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Gay Sandoval, 50, is a former Orange County deputy district
attorney who specialized in child-abuse cases. She went to Loyola Law
School and has also served on several municipal boards in her
hometown of Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point attorney John Adams, 50, handles civil cases and also
has headed up an automotive specialty retailer. A graduate of
Stanford Law School, he also was an activist in the fight against an
airport at the former El Toro Marine base.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign took a nasty turn after a private investigator dug
into Adams' background and divorce records, and turned them over to
Sandoval and the news media.</TE>
<TE>   The documents included details about a $218,000 loan in 1991 that
Adams failed to repay, which led to his parents losing a rental home.</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, Adams made a $55,000 cash down payment on a
home for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Sandoval made the disclosure a campaign issue. Adams called that
"despicable," saying the incident occurred during a difficult
financial period.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Bar Assn. has ranked Sandoval as "qualified."
The group did not rank Adams because he did not respond to the
association's questionnaire. Adams said he didn't believe the
association would offer a full appraisal of his career as a civil
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   In another countywide contest, Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly is pitted
against Newport Beach attorney Bruce Peotter in the race to become
the next Orange County Clerk-Recorder.</TE>
<TE>   The nonpartisan office handles documents ranging from birth
certificates and marriage licenses to property records.</TE>
<TE>   Daly, 48, has served as an Anaheim school board member, city
councilman and mayor for the past 17 years, and said he has worked
hard to gain the support of Democrats, Republicans and Independents.</TE>
<TE>   Daly says he would like to explore setting up satellite offices at
city halls, so residents would have easier access to county
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Peotter, 43, runs a document recording service. He says he is the
better choice because he's a Republican and Daly is a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Peotter says he shares voters' desire for small government.</TE>
<TE>   Peotter said he would like to explore using online services to
boost efficiency, and also possibly merging the clerk-recorder's
office with the registrar of voters.</TE>
<TE>   Both are seeking the office left vacant by the death of Gary L.
Granville in February.</TE>
<TE>   Granville, who announced his retirement shortly before his death,
had endorsed Daly.</TE>
<TE>   School Bond Measures: Renovations and Expansions Sought</TE>
<TE>   To repair decrepit facilities, tackle some long-needed renovations
and accommodate surging student populations, a pair of Orange County
community college districts and two school districts have put bond
measures worth a combined $804.5 million on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Community College District--which includes Orange Coast,
Golden West and Coastline Community colleges--is asking for voter
approval for $370 million in bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The money would be used to replace and upgrade deteriorating
buildings, some of which date to the 1940s. The money also will be
used for campus safety improvements and to upgrade computer systems
and other technology.</TE>
<TE>   The bond measure, Measure C, is being supported by a Huntington
Beach councilman, local business leaders and a former state secretary
of education. For homeowners in the district, the estimated annual
cost would be $24 per $100,000 of assessed property value.</TE>
<TE>   The Rancho Santiago Community College District is asking voters to
approve $337 million in bonds to improve and repair facilities at
Santa Ana College and Santiago Canyon College. The funding also would
be used for construction of training facilities and classrooms for
emergency workers and law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The bond measure, Measure E, has been endorsed by Assemblyman Bill
Campbell (R-Villa Park), Santa Ana Mayor Miguel Pulido and Orange
County Sheriff Michael S. Carona. The estimated annual cost would be
$24.63 per $100,000 of assessed property value.</TE>
<TE>   The Tustin Unified School District has proposed an $80-million
bond measure for maintenance and infrastructure improvements at the
district's 20 oldest schools, and refurbishment of a Tustin High
locker room with exposed wiring and rotting plaster. Measure G will
provide funding for new heating and air conditioning systems, as well
as new classrooms and science labs.</TE>
<TE>   The bond measure is supported by the president of the Foothill
Community Assn., as well local education officials. The estimated
annual cost would be $39.92 per $100,000 of assessed valuation.</TE>
<TE>   The Centralia School District is asking for voter approval of
$17.5 million in bonds for major renovations at schools such as Knott
Elementary in Buena Park, where the computer lab has no Internet
access and sewer lines are constantly clogged by tree roots.</TE>
<TE>   The money will also be used to make health and safety
improvements, roof repairs and upgrades to ventilation systems at
district schools.</TE>
<TE>   The measure is supported by a former La Palma councilman,
education officials and the CEO of the Buena Park Chamber of
Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The estimated annual cost would be $24 per $100,000 of assessed
valuation.</TE>
<TE>   Other Local Measures: Buena Park, Fullerton, San Juan Capistrano
and Garden Grove</TE>
<TE>   From a proposed new police station in Buena Park to a 175-home
housing development in San Juan Capistrano, voters will be asked to
approve dozens of local measures.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove voters will decide whether to raise the city's hotel
bed tax from 10% to 13%, an increase that is supported by community
leaders as a way to provide additional revenue for police, fire and
other city services.</TE>
<TE>   Some local taxpayer groups oppose the initiative, Measure N,
arguing that the city already has raised the bed tax twice. They said
the new rate is higher than in most neighboring cities, and will
drive business away.</TE>
<TE>   In San Juan Capistrano, two divisive issues will be on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Measure CC asks voters to decide whether to permit an upscale
housing development and a high school in the foothills on the east
side of town.</TE>
<TE>   The Whispering Hills development would include 175 homes and would
be accompanied by the city's first public high school in more than 40
years.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters include council members, school board members and the
head of the local PTA.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano voters also must decide whether the city
should sell 13 acres of undeveloped land to Home Depot Corp., a deal
that would net the city $9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Measure DD say the sale and new store will bring in
much-needed revenue, while local citizens groups opposed to the
measure fear it will drive small merchants out of business and ruin
the city's small-town charm.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton voters must decide whether to elect the city clerk or
have the City Council appoint someone to the post.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the city clerk is elected. Council members said Measure
M was prompted by the retirement of longtime City Clerk Audrey Culver
and lack of qualified candidates to succeed her.</TE>
<TE>   A citizens group accused council members of trying to usurp
voters' rights, and say it should remain an elected office to keep
the council from acquiring more power.</TE>
<TE>   Buena Park voters will decided whether to pay a special tax to
build a 50,000-square-foot police headquarters, which will include a
crime lab, jail, firing range, training center and emergency-services
dispatch center.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, the maximum tax for a single-family
residential parcel would be $19 per year. The special tax may be
levied only until 2033.</TE>

<CX>   Orange County bond measure -- A story that ran in some editions of a
voters guide published in the California section Sunday incorrectly
reported that approval of Measure C on the Nov. 5 ballot in parts of
Orange County, authorizing issuance of bonds for the Coast Community
College District, would cost homeowners $24 per $100,000 of assessed
property value annually. The bonds would cost $16.76 per $100,000 of
assessed property value.</CX>

<HD>Lively Races for Orange County School Boards</HD>
<DH>Contests in Anaheim and Garden Grove have the potential to
reshape boards where white conservatives now form the majorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Provoking people has never been a problem for Anaheim Union High
School District board member Harald Martin.</LD>
<LD>   The man who made headlines when he advocated compensation from
other countries for educating undocumented immigrants knows that
ousting him is the main draw for some candidates in Orange County's
most crowded school board race.</LD>
<LD>   Of the dozen candidates seeking three seats, at least a few say
Martin's influence on the board should end. On his ballot statement,
business owner Amin David gives as his first priority: to "keep
schools safe and hold Harald Martin accountable."</LD>
<TE>   The Anaheim district is one of 24 Orange County school districts
with races on the Nov. 5 ballot. The candidates run the gamut of
community leaders, former board members, retirees and incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   Although many parent and teacher groups in the county say the
majority of contests are bland affairs, they say the Anaheim and
Garden Grove races have the potential to reshape boards where white
conservatives now form the majorities.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the potential to become a historic district rather than
one that's a laughingstock," said David, president of the Latino
networking group Los Amigos of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   In the Garden Grove Unified School District, attorney Lan Nguyen
is making history as the country's first Vietnamese American to run
for school board, according to the Asian Pacific American Municipal
Officials, a constituency group of the National League of Cities.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen is vying for one of two seats. Also running are a
basketball coach and two incumbents who were elected eight years ago
with the support of an organization that sought to create a county
network of conservative school board members.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said despite the outpouring of candidates trying to
supplant him, he doesn't regret anything he has done during his eight
years on the board. "I'm a horrible politician because I tell people
exactly what I believe," he said. And the turbulence may not be over
if board President Katherine Smith wins her dark-horse bid for state
school superintendent and steps down, leaving an open seat.</TE>
<TE>   While Martin's outspoken convictions have energized challengers,
some candidates and community members also object to the way three of
the five current trustees got on the board -- by appointment. They
contend the process for the most recent appointments -- Dennis Doi
and Brian O'Neal -- did not include a public request for
applications.</TE>
<TE>   Appointed candidates Doi, who took office in July, and Thomas
"Hoagy" Holguin, who has been on the board for two years, are on the
ballot. O'Neal took over for a trustee whose seat is up for election
in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "[David] is only complaining because myself and O'Neal are not
Latino," said Doi, a retired electrician who advocates increased
parental involvement and more programs for non-college-bound
students. "If it were him and another Latino appointed the same way,
you can bet he wouldn't say anything."</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Christine Villegas said a change of leadership is needed
to get the school district moving in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   "There needs to be someone on the board who can get that focus off
race," said Villegas, a planning consultant to the city of Anaheim.
"The school board should be ignoring [race], and instead tackling
what it can do to help the community."</TE>
<TE>   Villegas said she is running to ensure that the district offers
opportunities to all students.</TE>
<TE>   The three incumbents have put a priority on offering vocational
classes for those who aren't college-bound, said Holguin, who owns a
commercial contracting business.</TE>
<TE>   David said that those goals would be better accomplished if there
were Spanish-speaking board members.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said his emphasis on students' citizenship status is tied
to his desire to provide pupils their entitled share of funding: "I'm
going to keep fighting that battle because every dollar spent on a
student who is in this country illegally is one stolen from another
student who is rightfully here."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm constantly working at trying to move the education of
students into the forefront and the bureaucracy into the background,"
said Martin, an Anaheim police officer.</TE>
<TE>   The Anaheim Secondary Teachers Assn. has endorsed one candidate,
restaurant owner Frank Cozza Jr., who backs efforts to retain
enthusiastic teachers and increased board accountability for test
scores.</TE>
<TE>   "This one candidate in particular seems to have no hidden agendas
nor any alignment with current board members," said Carol Comparsi,
the group's president.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates include Denise Mansfield-Reinking, a former board
member in Northern California's Rio Linda Union School District, who
supports improved after-school programs and increased parental
control over district decisions.</TE>
<TE>   David Vill, a retired teacher, said school boards should make a
greater effort to explore other districts' policies to create "best
practices" types of programs.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Marmaduke "Tony" Clark, who works for a bingo supply
company, said he wants to improve Anaheim schools to lure students
attending private schools, and to support district administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Stewart, who resigned his seat on the Anaheim Union school
board two years ago saying he didn't have enough time to fulfill his
duties, is also a candidate. Stewart was unavailable for comment.
Judy Velasquez Ashbaugh, a UC Irvine customer representative, and
Vernon Beckett of Cypress were unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In the Garden Grove race, Nguyen said he is running because he
believes minority families need a voice in decision-making in the
49,800-student district, which is 72% nonwhite. "Right now, the board
and district policies are controlled by a majority that's a
Christian, right-wing, extremist type of group," he said. "That
doesn't sit very well with the diversity of the student-body that it
serves."</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent Terry Cantrell, who is seeking a third term, said the
board's emphasis has been on serving all students equally.</TE>

<TE>   As the candidates in both districts try to focus on education

<TE>   Villegas said she is running to ensure that the district offers
opportunities to all students.</TE>
<TE>   She said that while attending Magnolia High, she wasn't given
guidance about college. "While I realize that college isn't for every
single person, everyone should know how to get themselves there if
they want to," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The three incumbents have put a priority on offering wood shop,
auto mechanics and other vocational classes for those who aren't
college-bound, said Holguin, who owns a commercial contracting
business.</TE>
<TE>   "A diploma just doesn't have as much validity as it used to,"
Holguin said. "We're trying to ensure that even for students who
aren't academically strong, at least we've introduced them to some
type of trade that they can continue with."</TE>
<TE>   David said that those goals would be better accomplished if there
were Spanish-speaking board members.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to communicate in the language that is meaningful to
Latinos," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, who called David "no better than some petty dictator
trying to keep his people down," said that his emphasis on students'
citizenship status is tied to his desire to provide pupils their
entitled share of funding: "I'm going to keep fighting that battle
because every dollar spent on a student who is in this country
illegally is one stolen from another student who is rightfully here."</TE>
<TE>   He said that those discussions do not detract from the board's
responsibility toward students.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm constantly working at trying to move the education of
students into the forefront and the bureaucracy into the background,"
said Martin, an Anaheim police officer.</TE>
<TE>   The Anaheim Secondary Teachers Assn. has endorsed only one of the

the group's president.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates include Denise Mansfield-Reinking, a former board
member in Northern California's Rio Linda Union School District, who
supports improved after-school programs and increased parental
control over district decisions.</TE>
<TE>   David Vill, a retired teacher who taught for 30 years in schools
across the United States and in Panama, said that school boards
should make a greater effort to explore other districts' policies to
create "best practices" types of programs.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Marmaduke "Tony" Clark, who works for a bingo supply
company, said he wants to improve Anaheim schools to lure students
attending private schools, and to support district administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Stewart, who resigned his seat on the Anaheim Union school
board two years ago saying he didn't have enough time to fulfill his
duties, is also a candidate. Stewart, who has been a supporter of
"back-to-basics" teaching, was unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Velasquez Ashbaugh, a UC Irvine customer representative, and
Cypress resident Vernon Beckett did not file candidate statements
with the county registrar and were unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In the Garden Grove race, Nguyen said he is running because he

and district policies are controlled by a majority that's a

doesn't sit very well with the diversity of the students body that it
serves."</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent Terry Cantrell, who is seeking a third term, said the
board's emphasis has been on serving all students equally. He added
that although 51% of the district's students have limited English
proficiency, their test scores are consistently above state and
national averages.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say that is evidence right there that we do an
overwhelmingly good job with students of all cultures," Cantrell he
said.</TE>

<HD>When a Judge Is Forced to Play God</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a better world, no judge would have to pass judgment on a person
who can't talk, feel, move or breathe on his own. No judge would have
to decide whether a 14-month-old child, whose most constant companion
has been a ventilator, should live or die.</LD>
<LD>   But this is the world we've got, and because it is, Orange County
Superior Court Judge Richard E. Behn has an unpleasant duty ahead of
him. The judge has said he'll decide next week whether to take baby
Christopher off the life-support that has kept him alive for the last
10 1/2 months.</LD>
<LD>   To say baby Christopher won't have a say in the matter is to state
the obvious. But why not his parents, you ask.</LD>
<TE>   Are you referring to the father now in County Jail facing charges
for allegedly shaking the boy so violently that he irreparably
damaged his brain?</TE>
<TE>   Or his mother, who before the final act apparently had fretted
about the father's rough treatment of the boy but hadn't alerted
authorities?</TE>
<TE>   In a perverse twist on a parenting dispute, the two have differing
thoughts on its outcome: the mother wants the boy taken off
life-support; the father wants the boy to be kept alive in the hope a
medical miracle can someday improve his condition.</TE>
<TE>   I don't see any Solomonic option for the judge. The boy will live
or die, according to his dictate.</TE>
<TE>   Three doctors testified last week that the boy won't recover from
his condition and recommended he be removed from life-support.</TE>
<TE>   From the comfortable distance of those of us who don't have to
decide it, the judge's course seems clear. He should remove the boy
from life-support and spare him -- and society -- whatever personal
or financial cost would come from living on a machine.</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't want to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Who wants on their conscience that they were the ones to end a
14-month-old child's life?</TE>
<TE>   It's not like Behn would have the comfort, say, of a doctor who
knew he or she had done everything to save the child.</TE>
<TE>   No, Behn enters at the end game.</TE>
<TE>   You could argue that the safe choice would be to let Christopher
live, even if artificially.</TE>
<TE>   It would take the burden off the judge about ending an innocent
child's life and lets other people -- those in charge of long-term
care -- to worry about expenses or the boy's "quality of life."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Behn could do, and while I'm guessing most of us
instinctively know it would be the wrong decision, I wouldn't be
leading any effort to criticize him. If a judge is asked to play God
in a case and opts for life, who among us should blame him?</TE>
<TE>   I don't know Judge Behn or his personal beliefs. I don't know if
he's guided in this case by anything other than how he defines the
boy's welfare. Or how he defines life. It's also unclear whether a
judge pulling the plug on a brain-injured infant would affect the
severity of the legal charges facing the father, which now is felony
child abuse. If the boy dies on his own, authorities could pursue
murder charges.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not trying to fudge things. If I were the judge, I'd remove
the boy from life-support. That isn't the same as wanting to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Harold LaFlamme, whose law firm is representing the boy, says,
"It's one of those things where you want to do the right thing for
the boy. It's a real hard thing to sort out, obviously, under these
circumstances. If it was your own child, what would I do, that's been
the posture we've taken."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, LaFlamme won't say what he thinks the judge should
do.</TE>
<TE>   I don't blame him.</TE>
<TE>   As for the judge, my sympathies. I'll bet no one in law school
ever told him there'd be days like this.</TE>

<LD>The seven statewide propositions appearing on the Nov. 5 ballot:</LD>
<LD>   PROPOSITION 46</LD>
<LD>   Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Bond Act</LD>
<TE>   Would create a $2.1-billion trust fund to build and refurbish
low-income housing and expand shelters for battered women and
homeless families with children. Includes repairs and improvements to
apartments for families and disabled citizens; military veteran
homeownership assistance; and security improvements and repairs to
existing emergency shelters. Makes cities and counties eligible to
receive specified funds. Subjects expenditures to independent audit.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters: Pete Major, executive director, Habitat for Humanity,
Orange County; Barbara Inatsugu, president, League of Women Voters of
California; Dr. Kathie Mathis, executive director, Assn. to Aid
Victims of Domestic Violence; Tom Porter, state director of AARP; Dan
Terry, president, California Professional Firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents: State Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside), chairman, Senate
Constitutional Amendments Committee; Assemblyman Anthony Pescetti
(R-Rancho Cordova), vice chairman, Assembly Utilities and Commerce
Committee; John Coupal, president, Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.; Lew
Uhler, president, National Tax Limitation Committee.</TE>
<TE>   PROPOSITION 47</TE>
<TE>   Kindergarten-University Public Education Facilities Bond Act</TE>
<TE>   Provides a bond issue of $13.05 billion to build new public
schools and colleges to relieve overcrowding and accommodate growing
student enrollment, and to repair older schools. Funds will be
targeted to areas of greatest need and must be spent according to
strict accountability measures.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters: Allan Zaremberg, president, California Chamber of
Commerce; Jan Harp Domene, president, California State PTA; Larry
McCarthy, president, California Taxpayers Assn.; Wayne Johnson,
president, California Teachers Assn.; Bill Hauck, co-chairman,
Taxpayers for Accountability and Better Schools; Barbara Inatsugu,
president, League of Women Voters of California.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents: State Sen. William "Pete" Knight (R-Palmdale); Jon
Coupal, president, Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.; Lewis Uhler,
president, National Tax Limitation Committee; Edward J. Costa,
chairman, California Taxpayers Coalition; Ralph Morrell, president,
Northern California Committee for Limited Government; Ken Steadman,
president, Waste Watchers Inc.</TE>
<TE>   PROPOSITION 48</TE>
<TE>   Court Consolidation</TE>
<TE>   Would amend the state Constitution to delete references to the
municipal courts, which are now obsolete because of the consolidation
of superior and municipal trial courts into unified superior courts
previously approved by the voters. Makes certain conforming and
related changes in the Constitution to reflect consolidation.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters: Assemblyman Howard Wayne (D-San Diego); David Huebner,
chairman, California Law Revision Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents: Gary B. Wesley and Melvin L. Emerich, co-chairmen,
Voter Information Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   PROPOSITION 49</TE>
<TE>   Before- and After-School Programs</TE>
<TE>   Would require the state to spend up to $550 million a year on such
programs that provide tutoring, homework assistance and educational
enrichment. Current state spending is about $117 million a year.
Beginning in 2004-05, money for the programs would have to come from
the state general fund and not from education funding guaranteed
under Proposition 98. The measure would not go into effect until the
non-education portion of the budget grew by at least $1.5 billion
over its highest level in the previous four years. Makes every public
elementary and middle/junior high school, including charter schools,
eligible for after-school grants ranging from $50,000 to $75,000.
Maintains local funding match requirement. Gives priority to schools
with predominantly low-income students. Spending could be reduced
only if the Legislature suspended Proposition 98 (which is unlikely
to happen, according to the legislative analyst's office) or if
voters passed a subsequent ballot measure. Critics contend that the
proposition's built-in protections could lead to cuts in other
social, health and education programs during an economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters: Arnold Schwarzenegger, actor; Wayne Johnson,
president, California Teachers Assn.; Warren Rupf, president,
California State Sheriffs Assn.; Jon Coupal, president, Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn.; Tom Porter, state director, AARP.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents: Barbara Inatsugu, president, League of Women Voters of
California.</TE>
<TE>   PROPOSITION 50</TE>
<TE>   Water Quality, Supply and Safe Drinking Water Projects</TE>
<TE>   and Coastal Wetlands Purchase and Protections Bonds</TE>
<TE>   Authorizes $3.44 billion in general obligation bonds to fund a
variety of water projects; grants and loans to reduce Colorado River
water use; the purchase, protection and restoration of coastal
wetlands near urban areas; improved security for state, local and
regional water systems; grants for desalination and drinking water
disinfection; development of river parkways; restoration of habitat
in the San Franciso Bay-San Joaquin Delta estuary.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters: Barbara Inatsugu, president, League of Women Voters of
California; Dan Taylor, vice president, National Audubon Society;
Marguerite Young, California director, Clean Water Action; Dan Terry,
president, California Professional Firefighters; Phillip J. Pace,
chairman, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents: Ernie Dynda, president, United Organizations of
Taxpayers; Edward J. Costa, chief executive, Peoples Advocate; Tom C.
Rogers, chairman, Citizens Against Unfair Taxation; Richard Ahern,
vice president, Waste Watchers Inc.</TE>
<TE>   PROPOSITION 51</TE>
<TE>   Transportation. Distribution of Existing Motor Vehicle Sales and
Use Tax</TE>
<TE>   Will create a "Traffic Congestion Relief and Safe School Bus Trust
Fund" by claiming 30% of the sales tax revenue from the lease and
sale of new and used motor vehicles that currently goes to the
state's general fund. The money would be used for school bus safety,
clean air programs, highway and mass transit improvements, among
other things. Also identifies 45 transportation and environmental
projects around the state that would receive specified amounts of
money each year. Redirects specified General Fund revenues of $420
million in 2002-03, $910 million in 2003-04, and increasing amounts
annually thereafter, depending on the increase in the sale and
leasing of motor vehicles. Opponents contend that the measure will
lock in spending on these projects at the expense of health,
education or other needs.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters: Lt. Ed Gray, president, California Organization of
Police and Sheriffs; Kirk Hunter, co-chairman, School Transportation
Coalition; Paul Burris, president, Partners for Highway Safety; Dana
Rose, state coordinator, California Safe Kids Network; Dr. John
Balmes, American Lung Assn. of California; Arturo Venegas Jr.,
Sacramento chief of police.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents: Barbara Inatsugu, president, League of Women Voters of
California; Lenny Goldberg, executive director, California Tax Reform
Assn.; Lewis Uhler, president, National Tax Limitation Committee; Jon
Coupal, president, Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   PROPOSITION 52</TE>
<TE>   Election Day Voter Registration. Voter Fraud Penalties</TE>
<TE>   Would allow eligible citizens to register to vote up to and
including election day. Increases criminal penalty for voter and
voter registration fraud, and criminalizes conspiracy to commit voter
fraud. In the 27 days before an election, citizens must register or
re-register at their county registrar's office. On election day,
eligible residents could register or re-register at their local
precinct, provided they have proof they live in the area. Creates a
fund to implement the measure and requires trained staff at polling
places to manage election day registration. Current law requires
voters to register by the 15th day before an election. Opponents say
the change would make the system more vulnerable to fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters: Lee Baca, Los Angeles County sheriff; March Fong Eu,
former secretary of state; Barbara Inatsugu, president, League of
Women Voters of California; Rocky Delgadillo, Los Angeles city
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents: Jan Scully, Sacramento County district attorney; Mike
Carona, Orange County sheriff; Sharon Runner, co-chairman, Citizens &amp;
Law Enforcement Against Election Fraud; Ed Jagels, Kern County
district attorney; Roy Burns, president, Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs
Assn.; Jill Schall, president, Women Prosecutors of California.</TE>

<HD>Christian Bikers Roll In to Rev Up the Reverent</HD>
<DH>The Soldiers for Jesus motorcycle club joins thousands of
men attending an Anaheim worship conference.</DH>

<LD>The Soldiers for Jesus motorcycle club rumbled to the Anaheim
Convention Center Saturday, searching for spirituality at a religious
conference attended by thousands of men.</LD>
<LD>   Dingy bikers -- some wearing camouflage, others in leather and
bandanas -- joined their conservatively dressed brethren to hear
speakers talk about using biblical principles to solve everyday
problems.</LD>
<LD>   The secretary-treasurer for the club's Los Angeles-Orange County
chapter, who wanted to be known only as Jim, said he and his men were
there to strengthen "our pretty neat ministry," which works to save
the souls of bikers from the more renegade clubs.</LD>
<TE>   "Jesus loves bikers. All bikers. Our purpose is to spread the
Gospel to any and all outlaw motorcycle clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers for Jesus is a place where outlaw bikers can go to be
saved and still be in an outlaw club," said Jim, a 33-year-old Chino
Hills resident and father of two young children.</TE>
<TE>   The club has chapters throughout the United States and South
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the bikers somehow blended in with about 11,000 other
men who attended the 14th annual men's conference sponsored by
Calvary Chapel.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Reynolds, associate pastor at Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa,
said participants came from various Christian denominations to boost
attendance at the one-day conference to a record.</TE>
<TE>   He said that speakers used the conference theme "The Armor of God"
to "show how life is a battle to stand up and be men of God,
committed to God, family and community."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Rogers, 52, said this year's theme is especially relevant,
given what he and others at the conference said was society's
continued slide to secularism and its belief that men are less
spiritual than women.</TE>
<TE>   "Our primary desire is that men become good Christian fathers and
husbands and lead their homes in a way that God has asked," said
Rogers, a Costa Mesa resident who said his son is a pastor and his
daughter is married to one.</TE>
<TE>   Zach Martinez, 54, of Huntington Beach was in the prayer room
clutching a Bible and reflecting on his life, which he said had been
caught in the grip of schizophrenia before escaping to the bliss of
spiritual har- mony.</TE>
<TE>   "I was nuts as heck until I was saved by spirituality. Some people
do yoga to find inner peace. Christians use spirituality," Martinez
said.</TE>
<TE>   The conference ended early enough for the faithful to head home
and pray for an Angels victory in the sixth game of the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   But does God really favor a baseball team with a heavenly mascot?</TE>
<TE>   "I'll pray for a win tonight," said a man standing with a group
discussing the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "God's too busy to hear Giants' prayers," said a friend, who was
obviously an Angels fan.</TE>

<HD>In San Diego, a Fierce Battle for District Attorney's
Office Gets Personal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Silver</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Among the numerous plaques that hang on the office walls of San Diego
County Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst are a series of engraved tributes and
awards for leadership in cultural diversity.</LD>
<LD>   He doesn't say anything as he points to the honors from the
African American Bar Assn. and the La Raza Lawyers Assn. as he slowly
makes his way around his desk on the top floor of the Hall of
Justice. He wants them to speak for themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Pfingst, in fact, would rather not have to defend himself at all
against allegations that he made anti-Semitic slurs as a young deputy
prosecutor in the mid-1980s. His opponent, Superior Court Judge
Bonnie Dumanis, who is Jewish, says she would rather not have to
address it either.</LD>
<TE>   But in what has shaped up as the most brutal political battle for
the district attorney's office this county has ever seen, observers
say, it seems the only thing everyone else can talk about.</TE>
<TE>   It is a race that most outside the law-and-order crowd would
usually ignore. Not this year. The character attacks have become
fodder for talk radio, local magazine covers and e-mail chat.
Political observers say the attention on this campaign in this county
rivals the governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   While Pfingst was fending off accusations that he called a Jewish
colleague a "Jew bastard" and referred to his car with a similar slur
17 years ago, Dumanis had to admit on the campaign trail that she had
attempted suicide 16 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Both campaigns have swathed themselves in the same blanket denial;
they insist they haven't participated in the negative barbs and that
the fault lies with the opposing camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here 20 years, and I've never seen these kinds of
issues surface before," said Steve Erie, a political science
professor at UC San Diego. "D.A. races are usually staid affairs."</TE>
<TE>   The contest opened about a year ago when Pfingst's deputy district
attorneys took a vote of no confidence in their boss. Two-thirds of
the 300 deputies voted for a proclamation saying he had a "lack of
ethics, integrity and honesty."</TE>
<TE>   The deputy prosecutors' action capped a second term in office
filled with controversy. In 2000, the head of his fraud division
resigned after being investigated for running a personal real estate
business out of the office.</TE>
<TE>   The state attorney general's office took over the investigation
and served a search warrant on Pfingst's office. The chief deputy
eventually pleaded guilty to felony grand theft for using legal
assistants and secretaries in the office to help with his business.</TE>
<TE>   Also during his last term, two deputy prosecutors sued the county
in separate lawsuits for gender discrimination when they were
transferred after returning from pregnancies. Together, they won $1.5
million. Pfingst defends himself by saying he wasn't named in the
lawsuit. But he was the head of the office at the time.</TE>
<TE>   A field of primary challengers stepped in. Dumanis, 50, a former
prosecutor and now a judge, emerged with 23% of the vote in the
primary and the endorsement of the deputy prosecutors. Pfingst, 50,
took 41% in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in depositions for a discrimination lawsuit that deputy
prosecutor Richard Sachs filed against the county, another deputy
prosecutor said he recalled Pfingst making the Jewish jokes.</TE>
<TE>   In sworn testimony, James E. Atkins said he recalled Pfingst
making anti-Semitic remarks about Sachs among a group of deputy
prosecutors who often did so during their after-work happy hour
visits. Sachs says he was not promoted because of a medical condition
and because Pfingst didn't think his appearance fit that of a top
prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   Other deputy prosecutors -- including deputy prosecutor of the
year Bonnie Howard-Regan -- have come forward in recent weeks to
corroborate parts of Atkins' testimony, some in their own
depositions.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst says he was probably at the bar where the jokes were made
about Sachs. But he denies making any anti-Semitic comments. He was
raised Catholic but his grandfather was Jewish, as are some of his
"closest personal friends," including his daughter's godmother, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no words to defend it. That's why it's so effective,"
Pfingst said. "I know they lied under oath."</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst said he is sure Dumanis is behind the accusation. Atkins
is one of her supporters and has contributed to her campaign, as has
Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   But Dumanis says there's no way she could have been involved in
the scheduling of Sachs' depositions. He filed the case two years
ago, before she was in the race. Dumanis said she didn't know about
the anti-Semitic allegations until Atkins called her after he
testified.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the depositions became public, Pfingst told a reporter
for the San Diego Union-Tribune that he ran into two boys, about age
11 or 12, who said they recognized him. Pfingst was walking in
Encinitas on his way to a fund-raiser when he said the boys said,
"You're famous, aren't you? You're Pfingst. You hate Jews." And then
Pfingst said they yelled after him, "Jew hater! Jew hater!"</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst said he couldn't talk about the incident again other than
to say it was the most horrific experience of his life.</TE>
<TE>   His opponents question whether the encounter ever occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "The roar of laughter that went through the D.A.'s office -- I've
never seen anything like it. I haven't heard one person say they
believed it," said the prosecutor association's president, Mark
Pettine.</TE>
<TE>   Dumanis' character issues were brought up at a public forum during
the primary race. A member of the audience posed an anonymous
question asking whether any of the candidates had been treated for
mental illness. Dumanis told the audience she had attempted suicide
16 years ago as a delayed reaction to her sister's murder.</TE>
<TE>   She believes Pfingst's campaign consultant, Larry Remer, planted
the question because she says he tried to get reporters to write
about the issue three weeks before. Remer denies it. And Pfingst says
he hasn't been involved in any kind of campaigning other than
addressing their professional differences and experience.</TE>
<TE>   Each candidate has raised about $500,000. They are spending their
final contributions on a series of 30-second prime-time TV
commercials. Their aim is to address judicial issues. Character is
never mentioned.</TE>

<HD>Secession Supporters Confront Hahn at Fair</HD>
<DH>Activists accuse mayor of lying. He tells 2,000 seniors
small cities can't match L.A. services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just 10 days before the election, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn was
dogged at a city fair for seniors Saturday by a dozen sign-carrying
secession supporters who said he had lied about the potential harm of
a split.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn took his anti-secession campaign to an Encino park, where he
told 2,000 senior citizens at the city-sponsored fair that Los
Angeles is able to provide many services to them that smaller cities
cannot afford.</LD>
<LD>   Secessionists followed the mayor around the event and objected to
the use of taxpayers' money to pay for a fair where city officials
spoke against secession.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an absolute misuse of taxpayers' money but it's consistent
with what the mayor has been doing all along in using taxes for his
anti-secession effort," said Frank Sheftel, who is running for a city
council seat in the proposed San Fernando Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, secessionists holding a banner shouted at city
workers who tried to move them away from a stage where Hahn was
speaking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's public property," they said, until the city workers left
them alone. Police took an incident report from one secession leader
who said he had been manhandled by city workers.</TE>
<TE>   The secession supporters carried their signs and banner all around
Hahn as he led senior citizens on a one-mile walk around Balboa Lake.</TE>
<TE>   The city spent $40,000 on the Senior/Caregiver Fair and Health
Festival in Lake Balboa Park, using 29 buses to bring in elderly
residents from all over Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   With some campaign officials predicting low voter turnout on Nov.
5, secession supporters and opponents alike predicted that senior
citizens, who tend to turn out in larger numbers in elections than
younger voters, would play a key role.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the event was meant to educate senior citizens about the
great services provided by the city, not to campaign against
secession.</TE>
<TE>   But before Hahn spoke, his campaign workers passed out a flier
warning seniors that they could lose rent control and low-cost lunch
programs if cityhood measures for Hollywood and San Fernando Valley
are passed.</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE's president, Jeff Brain, later said his group would
file a complaint with the city Ethics Commission and the Los Angeles
County district attorney, alleging the use of public resources for
political purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Former U.S. Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, who introduced Hahn, told the
audience that "secession is a very risky business" that could hurt
seniors financially.</TE>
<TE>   "There would be a major shortage of funds that could result in an
increase in taxes and a decrease in services or both," Fiedler said.
"A cash-strapped San Fernando Valley would not likely have additional
money to subsidize the Meals on Wheels program."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn did not mention secession by name in his speech, but told of
a Malibu resident who said he had moved to Los Angeles for seniors'
services not available in his own city.</TE>
<TE>   "We provide programs to people that many other cities don't," Hahn
said. "We are able to do that because we are a great city."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview before the speech, Hahn said splitting Los Angeles
into three cities could force a cutback in specialized programs now
offered to senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "If we all have less money to spend, those might be the kinds of
things people say we can't afford," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Dennis Zine interrupted his own speech on the
greatness of Los Angeles and pointed to a secession supporter holding
a sign in the back of the audience. "Every time you've got a
wonderful party, you've got a party pooper, and there's the party
pooper right there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Seniors at the event seemed divided over secession. Ruth Smith
walked with the mayor and shook her head at the pro-secession signs
all around her.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this city. Why in the hell would anybody try to pull it
apart?" the retired teacher asked. "I live in Valley Village in a
wonderful neighborhood and it's not in dire neglect."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Southwell of Sherman Oaks scoffed at the mayor's warnings of
the negative effects on senior programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe a word of it," she said, adding that secession is
about localizing government and decision-making. "If our government
is not so big, our taxes will be spent better."</TE>

California Concerns</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There are few issues that matter more in politics than peace and
prosperity. And yet as the economy drags its heels and the nation
marches toward possible war with Iraq, there is an oddly disconnected
feel to this election season in California.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps it's because those issues and their associated anxieties
seem so far removed from Sacramento. "There's no state election
that's going to affect anything having to do with terrorism,
international affairs, snipers or anything that people seem to be
fixated on," said political analyst Tony Quinn, a former GOP
strategist. "And there's no sign that people think Sacramento has
anything to do with the economy of California."</LD>
<LD>   The latter view may be overly dismissive. But events and
politicians alike have conspired to rob this election of much of its
usual enticement.</LD>
<TE>   In redrawing the state's legislative and congressional boundaries
-- part of a once-a-decade process reflecting population shifts --
the Legislature managed to effectively remove serious competition
from all but a few contests across the state.</TE>
<TE>   After inserting himself into the other party's primary through a
$10-million advertising blitz against front-runner Richard Riordan,
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis drew the opponent he preferred. He is now
a solid favorite to win a second term over Republican businessman
Bill Simon Jr. -- notwithstanding voters' deep and abiding distaste
for him.</TE>
<TE>   Hanging over it all is the insidious shadow of Sept. 11, which
suddenly made the world seem a smaller and more vulnerable place --
and the usual back-and-forth of politics seem irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   "The big concern for voters is over things they can't control,"
said Jaime Regalado, a political scientist and executive director of
the Pat Brown Institute at Cal State Los Angeles. "People are saying,
'I'm not sure voting is the way to safeguard myself in this new
world.' "</TE>
<TE>   The jagged tone of the race for governor has hardly offered much
reassurance.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, experts are forecasting a record low turnout on
election day, Nov. 5, to match the overwhelming stay-at-home rate in
the March primary, when only about a quarter of eligible Californians
cast ballots.</TE>
<TE>   The apathy is evident to strategists like Gale Kaufman. The
Democratic consultant has convened numerous focus groups in the last
18 months -- only to find the people complaining at the prospect of
having to discuss politics for a full two hours. "People just don't
seem to care," Kaufman said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, millions of Californians will turn out to vote in just
nine days, grudgingly or not. Some will act out of patriotism or a
sense of civic responsibility. Others will enter the polling booth
fired with conviction: for Davis or for Simon, to split apart the
city of Los Angeles or to keep the nation's second-largest city
intact.</TE>
<TE>   It may not be war and peace, but there are plenty of important
decisions to be made, among them filling eight statewide offices,
ruling on seven state ballot initiatives, confirming three California
Supreme Court justices and deciding those few competitive legislative
and congressional races that present true contests.</TE>
<TE>   Topping the ticket is the race for governor, headlined by two
candidates who have spent far more time dwelling on their rival's
shortcomings than offering any affirmative thoughts on, say, dealing
with the state's budget problems, its fraying infrastructure or
overcrowded freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has attacked businessman Simon as a right-wing political
novice in far over his head -- an assault abetted by the rookie
candidate's frequent campaign stumbles. Simon has assailed Davis as
an ineffective and unprincipled money-grubber -- a charge underlined
by the incumbent's hesitant response to the budget and electricity
crises, and his ceaseless fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Many despairing voters look at the two and see "the classic
situation of choosing between the lesser of two evils," as voter
Anthony Fenner, an Oakland Democrat, recently put it, using perhaps
the most oft-heard statement of this discontented election cycle.
"Maybe it's the time to vote my heart instead of trying to avoid
someone more horrible than the guy I'm voting for," said the
41-year-old cabinetmaker, who is thinking of backing the Green
Party's Peter Camejo or one of three other minor party candidates "to
get them on the map."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the race for governor, there are seven other statewide
contests to be decided. Democratic incumbents are defending three of
their seats against Republican challengers and assorted minor party
candidates: Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante faces state Sen. Bruce
McPherson; Treasurer Phil Angelides is running against Greg Conlon,
and Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer faces state Sen. Dick Ackerman.</TE>
<TE>   Three offices are open, vacated by term limits: Republican state
Sen. Tom McClintock is vying against Democrat Steve Westly in the
race for state controller; Republican Keith Olberg faces Democratic
Assemblyman Kevin Shelley in the race for secretary of state, and
Republican Gary Mendoza and Democrat John Garamendi are the leading
rivals in the insurance commissioner's race.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic state Sen. Jack O'Connell and Republican Katherine H.
Smith face each other in the contest for state superintendent of
public instruction, a nominally nonpartisan position.</TE>
<TE>   Term limits, enacted by voters in 1990, will ensure a number of
new faces in the state Legislature as well -- though Democrats are
certain to keep their partisan advantage as a result of the
party-protection plan adopted when lawmakers redrew state political
boundaries last year.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 20 state Senate and 80 Assembly races, analysts say fewer
than 10 are seriously competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Two of those hot contests are elections for open Assembly seats in
inland San Diego and Imperial and Riverside counties.</TE>
<TE>   The same lack of competition holds true in most of the 53 contests
for the House of Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Only one -- the fight to replace scandal-scarred Rep. Gary Condit
in the Central Valley -- is drawing heavy interest outside the
district. Democrat Dennis Cardoza of Atwater is favored over
Republican Dick Monteith of Modesto, despite lingering resentment on
the part of Condit supporters over Cardoza's decision to challenge
his former mentor in the Democratic primary.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, analysts give Republican Beth Rogers an outside shot at
ousting Democratic incumbent Lois Capps in Santa Barbara; in the Bay
Area, Democrat Elaine Shaw is bucking for an upset over Republican
Rep. Richard Pombo of Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Democrats are expected to slightly boost their lead in
California's House delegation.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to partisan offices, Californians will decide the fate
of seven statewide ballot initiatives, including $15 billion in bond
measures to build housing, improve water quality and renovate the
state's public schools, among various projects.</TE>
<TE>   Other ballot measures seek to expand after-school activities (an
initiative sponsored by actor Arnold Schwarzenegger); permanently
shift some motor vehicle sales taxes from the general fund to
transportation projects; and allow Californians to register to vote
as late as election day. The deadline for registering this year was
last Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Voters also will decide whether to retain three state Supreme
Court justices. Facing an up-or-down vote are justices Marvin R.
Baxter, Carlos R. Moreno and Kathryn M. Werdegar, appointees --
respectively -- of California's last three governors, Republicans
George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson, and Democrat Davis.</TE>

<HD>'Gunfighter's Surgeon' Became a Southwest Legend</HD>

<LD>He's been dead for more than 90 years, but a frontier boxing champion
and the man known as the "gunfighter's surgeon" came to life a few
weeks ago to say a few words about his life and frontier medicine.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. George Emery Goodfellow was among five deceased Angelenos
remembered at Angelus Rosedale Cemetery during the West Adams
Heritage Assn.'s annual living history tour. Actors decked out in
period costumes portrayed the famous -- and infamous -- buried at the
graveyard, known for its unusual epitaphs and tombstones.</LD>
<LD>   Like many of the cemetery's permanent residents, Goodfellow is one
whose noteworthy medical accomplishments, largely forgotten, should
be recalled from time to time.</LD>
<TE>   Whether he was pioneering the removal of enlarged prostates or
tending wounded gunfighters on the mean streets of Tombstone, Ariz.,
he kept it all alive in medical reports. He became a Southwest legend
and someone people pointed to and talked about during his brief time
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout a medical career that spanned more than three decades,
according to a 1973 paper published by retired Pasadena urologist
Earl F. Nation, Goodfellow achieved legendary status for his medical
care of Tombstone's outlaws and lawmen. He has the distinction of
being the first physician known to operate successfully on abdominal
gunshot wounds, and was praised as the first to perform a successful
"perineal prostatectomy" in 1891.</TE>
<TE>   Goodfellow was born in 1855 and raised in the northern Sierra
gold-mining town of Downieville. At age 12, his parents sent him to
school in Pennsylvania. Two years later, he returned to the Golden
State to attend the California Military Academy in Oakland. He
returned to the East in 1872 at 17, this time to attend the Naval
Academy in Annapolis.</TE>
<TE>   His Annapolis career was cut short when he knocked unconscious the
school's first black cadet, John Henry Conyers of South Carolina, in
a hazing incident. Because Goodfellow was the school's boxing
champion, it caused a public uproar and he was suspended. Weeks
later, Conyers was dismissed for fighting with his roommate.</TE>
<TE>   Goodfellow's maternal uncle, John Baskin, a Utah judge, interceded
with his friend, President Grant, and was assured that his nephew
would be reinstated after the public furor subsided. His uncle left
office, however, and Grant was then too busy winning reelection to
fulfill his promise.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than stay down for the count, Goodfellow began to study
medicine with his cousin, a doctor. In 1877, he graduated from what
is now the College of Wooster in Ohio, and that same year married a
Pennsylvanian, Katherine Colt. Together they returned to Oakland,
where Goodfellow opened a practice. Restless, he moved to Tombstone.</TE>
<TE>   Hung Shingle Over Bar</TE>
<TE>   In 1880, Goodfellow, 25, hung his shingle over the legendary
Crystal Palace Saloon. The town of 2,000 residents already had 12
doctors, but only he and three others sported diplomas.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 11 years, his association with the likes of Wyatt
Earp and his four brothers, Doc Holliday, Bat Masterson, John
O'Rourke, alias "Johnny-Behind-the-Deuce," "Curly" Bill Brocius,
"Buckskin" Frank Leslie, the Clanton and McLaury brothers, and a host
of others, put money in Goodfellow's pocket and earned him the
nickname the "gunfighter's surgeon."</TE>
<TE>   After the infamous 1881 shootout at the OK Corral, Goodfellow
helped to perform the autopsies on Billy Clanton and the McLaury
brothers.</TE>
<TE>   He also tended to the living: It was Goodfellow who pronounced
Morgan Earp's wound fatal after Earp was shot in the back while
playing pool with his brother Wyatt. When Virgil Earp was later
ambushed and his left arm almost blown off, Goodfellow removed four
inches of shattered bone, saving the useless arm. With his good arm,
Virgil could still handle a gun and later served as marshal in
Colton.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Goodfellow, a surgical innovator, published his
medical findings. He early on observed that abdominal wounds from the
Colt .44 or .45 were invariably fatal: "Gunfighters' maxim is 'shoot
for the guts,' knowing that death is certain, yet sufficiently
lingering and agonizing to afford a plenary sense of gratification to
the victor in the contest."</TE>
<TE>   In his notes on the "Impenetrability of Silk," he watched two
gamblers, Luke Short and Charlie Storms, in a gunfight in 1881, just
a few feet from where he stood. Short blasted Storms through the
heart. Upon examining Storms, Goodfellow noted that the gambler's
folded silk pocket handkerchief was stuffed into the chest wound.
Goodfellow pulled out the handkerchief and out came the bullet, which
had killed Storms when it penetrated the heart.</TE>
<TE>   Serving as coroner at various times in Tombstone, his verdicts
were the stuff of Wild West legend. In an autopsy report on a gambler
named McIntire, shot in an argument over a card game, Goodfellow
stated that he had done "the necessary assessment work and found the
body full of lead, but not too badly punctured to hold whiskey."</TE>
<TE>   In 1884, he watched a group of Tombstone vigilantes hang a
notorious Texas gunman, 32-year-old Jack Heath. The coroner's jury
required no testimony because all jurors were members of the
vigilante committee.</TE>
<TE>   All the jurors, including Goodfellow, had been witnesses or
parties to the lynching. The usual wording of "by parties unknown"
was too crass even for these hard-bitten men. So Goodfellow suggested
the victim died of emphysema. When some of the jury asked, "Hell,
Doc, what's that?" he replied, "Something that causes shortness of
breath at high altitudes."</TE>
<TE>   Befriended Geronimo</TE>
<TE>   Restless and seeking adventure, Goodfellow left Tombstone in 1886
and joined the manhunt for Apache chieftain Geronimo, who had escaped
from the San Carlos Reservation in central Arizona. After Geronimo
and his followers surrendered, Goodfellow befriended the great
warrior.</TE>
<TE>   Always intrigued by how an Apache within 10 feet of a sentry could
shoot an arrow without a twang of the bowstring being heard, he bet
Geronimo that the warrior couldn't do it. A tree was selected as a
target and Goodfellow shut his eyes. He didn't hear a thing. When he
opened them, there were three arrows in the tree, and Geronimo went
off to prison $20 richer.</TE>
<TE>   In 1886, while Goodfellow was still living in Tombstone, he led a
rescue team deep into Sonora, Mexico, to help victims of an
earthquake. The grateful townsfolk christened him "El Santo Doctor."
When he returned to Tombstone, Mexican President Porfirio Diaz sent
his soldiers to Arizona to present him with a horse (alleged to have
been stolen from the U.S. Cavalry) and a double-headed silver
Austrian Eagle, left behind by Mexico's short-lived Austrian-born
ruler Emperor Maximilian, who was executed in 1867.</TE>
<TE>   Still, cutting people open is what Goodfellow did best, even
though he lost a few along the way. In 1891, when he failed to save
the life of the chief surgeon of the Southern Pacific Railroad, who
had been shot by his estranged wife's attorney, he took over the
railroad doctor's job.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, at St. Mary's Hospital in Tucson, Goodfellow
performed what many consider the first perineal prostatectomy, an
operation he designed to treat bladder problems caused by an enlarged
prostate.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next decade, he crisscrossed the U.S. demonstrating his
operation and attracting patients from all parts of the country. Dr.
Hugh H. Young, a urology professor at Johns Hopkins, learned the
technique from Goodfellow.</TE>
<TE>   In 1896, Goodfellow set up practice in downtown Los Angeles at 621
S. Main St., joined the California Club and presented his vividly
detailed report on perineal prostatectomy before the Southern
California Medical Society. A few years later, after performing 78
operations, he documented two deaths. Survivors didn't suffer
incontinence or need a catheter after surgery.</TE>
<TE>   While in Los Angeles, he pioneered dramatic advances in spinal
anesthesia, and is credited with improving the technique by
dissolving cocaine crystals in spinal fluid. He later switched back
to chloroform after he said several of his patients began to die in
"strange and devious ways."</TE>
<TE>   Medicine Bag of Booze</TE>
<TE>   Always on the move, Goodfellow joined his good friend Gen. William
R. Shafter as a civilian volunteer in the Cuban campaign of the
Spanish-American War in 1898. Fluent in Spanish and armed with a
medicine bag of booze, Goodfellow persuaded an inept Cuban general to
surrender at Santiago de Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   For his trouble, Goodfellow received a rare commendation for
"especially meritorious services, professional and military." He
later remarked that never had alcohol been used for a better or more
therapeutic purpose.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Goodfellow settled in San Francisco and joined the
California Medical Assn. in 1901. Five years later, when the Great
Earthquake struck, he fled his hotel room in panic. He received
another jolt when he realized he had left behind the medical
manuscript that he had spent almost his entire life writing.</TE>
<TE>   The only possession he managed to save was an Asian rug that he
promptly loaned to the half-clad Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. Weeping
hysterically, Caruso somehow managed to wrap the rug around his
rotund body.</TE>
<TE>   Shaken not only by the earthquake but by a nervous disorder that
made it impossible for him to operate, Goodfellow returned to Los
Angeles to be with his daughter Edith, her husband, Dr. Charles W.
Fish, and his friend Wyatt Earp. Goodfellow died at Angelus Hospital
on Dec. 7, 1910, at age 54.</TE>
<TE>   Although his son-in-law stated that the cause of death was
"multiple neuritis," Dr. Nation, the Pasadena urologist, and others
suspected that Goodfellow died of alcoholism.</TE>

<HD>Just in Case, Breakup Foe Runs for Office</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the San Fernando Valley becomes an independent municipality,
Tamara Trank wants to represent Northridge and Granada Hills on its
city council.</LD>
<LD>   The petite 35-year-old has studied the issues, printed up fliers
and lawn signs, and taken part in community discussions and debates.</LD>
<LD>   There's just one catch.</LD>
<TE>   She's against secession.</TE>
<TE>   Which ordinarily would make it a little harder to sell her
candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   But this is no ordinary campaign. This is the colorful, perhaps
quixotic crusade to slice the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood out
of the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In this campaign, where 122 people are running for 20 offices in
two cities that might never exist, there are candidates who don't
believe in raising money, candidates who refuse to reveal their ages
and candidates -- all but two of them, actually -- with no experience
in elective office.</TE>
<TE>   One Hollywood candidate -- Angelyne -- is a billboard model, and
another, Gene La Pietra, is a nightclub owner whose heavy bankroll
has nearly single-handedly kept the city's secession effort rolling.</TE>
<TE>   In the Valley races, there is one candidate, Marc Strassman, who
touts Internet-democracy that would allow voters to weigh in on every
decision made by the city council. Another, Wayne "T-Bear" Crochet,
is mounting a write-in campaign. There are even one or two besides
Trank who oppose secession.</TE>
<TE>   Trank is a Navy Reserve lieutenant who holds a doctorate in
physiological science, plays the trumpet and helps run a
drum-and-bugle corps for teenagers -- and she is greeted warmly on
the stump. Some residents even say they've already voted for her
picking her name out of the list of candidates on their absentee
ballots.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent warm evening, Trank was standing in the middle of a
residential block in the Sherwood Forest neighborhood of Northridge
and working up the nerve to knock on someone's door, when Dave White
pulled up in a silver Ford Explorer.</TE>
<TE>   Trank, dressed in pink pants and a pink sweater, sidled up to the
car and introduced herself. But when she got to the part about not
supporting Measure F, the Valley secession proposal on the Nov. 5
ballot, White seemed a little confused.</TE>
<TE>   "So are you guys voting for Valley secession or not?" he asked
Trank and her husband, Ted Haulley.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not," Trank replied.</TE>
<TE>   She explained that she might support a future breakup proposal --
and never considered joining the campaign against this one -- but
that she has problems with the current plan. She worries that the new
city will have financial and organizational problems.</TE>
<TE>   She's running for office, she said, to be in place to help fix
those problems should the secession measure pass.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he could support such a candidate, White was polite.
"I'm not sure," he said. "I'm a big believer in it."</TE>
<TE>   Next stop is the home of Don Voorheis. He's more sure.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a strong Republican and I want to get out of the city of L.A.
as fast as possible," he said. "I can't understand how someone who is
running for a Valley city council is against secession."</TE>
<TE>   Trank is used to this.</TE>
<TE>   "Did he cuss me out?" she asked, after a reporter went back to ask
Voorheis a question. But she pressed on.</TE>
<TE>   Stefan Banescu agreed that the new city could face rough going in
the beginning. But he said he's voting for secession anyway -- and
promised to vote for Trank despite her reservations. He even agreed
to put a Trank for Council sign on his lawn.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the city should have its own chance," Banescu said.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents, Trank learned, had already voted by absentee
ballot. They picked from among the mostly unknown candidates on the
basis of such information as occupations listed on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "Your name sounds familiar," said Kelly Luna. "I think I voted for
you."</TE>
<TE>   Trank says voters have told her that she's won a few absentee
votes just based on her career, which she listed as
"physiologist/military officer." A liberal, she reckons that the
military label has made her the choice of a few conservatives who may
not know much about the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who do know who the candidates are is Margie
Oldenkamp.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember you," she said as Trank stood in her doorway. "You're
the one who says you're not for secession but if secession wins you
want to represent us."</TE>
<TE>   A strong secession supporter herself, Oldenkamp asked if Trank has
any literature. "I have to admire you for even running, and for
walking around the neighborhood," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The evening goes on this way, the precinct walking stymied a
little by the fact that so many houses have security gates, and a bit
random because the couple is working without their map showing where
frequent voters live. Haulley explains that the map is in a computer
program that wouldn't open.</TE>
<TE>   They wind up on a residential block of White Oak Avenue, where
neighbors like Pat Losurdo worry that the city will open up the
street to more traffic. Losurdo, a musician with a truck that says
"Captain Cardiac and the Coronaries" in big red letters on the side,
said he didn't hold Trank's opposition to secession against her, and
agreed to post a lawn sign -- which his wife later nixed.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as you're going to be working for us, I don't have a
problem with it," said Losurdo, who plans to vote for secession. "If
I like somebody, I'll vote for them. And I like you already."</TE>

<HD>Nine Candidates Vie for Valley's 8th District Seat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If a feeling of detachment from Los Angeles' core is fueling the
secession movement, then residents of the 8th district of the
proposed San Fernando Valley city council should be especially
supportive of a breakup. The district of West Hills, most of Woodland
Hills and part of Canoga Park is much closer to Ventura County than
to downtown L.A.</LD>
<LD>   "I love L.A. I love the things that make it uniquely and
distinctly L.A. The problem is, all those things are over on that
side of the hill," said Bill Cipolla, 42, a TV news producer who is
one of nine candidates for the 8th district seat."I think we can
create the city that we want," said Cipolla, who lives in West Hills.</LD>
<LD>   None of the candidates -- eight men and attorney-accountant Joyce
Pearson -- has held elective office. A few have worked in government.
Others are running on a lark. The 14-member Valley council will exist
only if secession wins on the Nov. 5 ballot.</LD>
<TE>   "We're all grass-roots people who care about where we live and
want to make this the best place possible for ourselves and the
entire community," said Barry Seybert, who sells video equipment and
lives in West Hills. Seybert, 46, calls himself a progressive
Democrat. The council is nonpartisan.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Littge, a West Hills contractor, did not file his candidacy
petition until the last day possible. "I really felt that the average
Joe like myself would have an honest-to-God chance of getting
elected," said Littge, 49. "Of course, it's a moot point if secession
doesn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll this month found secession trailing everywhere but
in the West Valley.One of the 8th district candidates, Woodland Hills
attorney Johnny Walker, was an architect of the Valley secession
plan. After more than six years of work, Walker, 53, says it is time
to "complete what we started."</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with the city of Los Angeles is, it's just too big,"
he said at a recent forum sponsored by the Woodland Hills Chamber of
Commerce. "There are too many rocks for the scoundrels to hide under
at the present time. We need smaller rocks and no scoundrels."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the candidates oppose the 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch
project in Ventura County, not far from the 8th district. Ventura
County would reap the tax revenue from the proposed development, they
say, and the Valley would get the traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson, a 52-year-old Woodland Hills resident, echoes many
secessionists' cries that Los Angeles business taxes are too high,
and that the Valley does not get its rightful share of police and
fire protection and other city services. Smaller cities such as
Burbank and Glendale should be models for a Valley city, said
Pearson, who urges voters to "make Joyce your choice."</TE>
<TE>   The Valley needs more police, the candidates say, because gangs
have crept into even Los Angeles' westernmost areas, where some
neighborhoods are among the city's most affluent and others remain
charmingly rural.</TE>
<TE>   "You have gangs in Canoga Park -- that was unheard-of before,"
said Garrett Biggs, a 26-year-old political consultant who has worked
for various Republican officeholders and candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Biggs, a Woodland Hills resident, and his opponents hope that
Valley cityhood will lead to the formation of a school district
separate from Los Angeles Unified.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something that's going to happen automatically, but how
does the state of California ignore the sixth largest city in the
nation? How can they not give us our own school district?" Biggs
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to live in a city that has a school district I can be
proud to send my children to," said candidate Eugene Butler, 53, a
Canoga Park actor and teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Like all secessionists, the 8th district candidates promise that
the government of a Valley city will be more responsive to citizens,
if only because it will be closer to them.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates all have anecdotes to demonstrate that "Los Angeles
is big, and they don't care," as engineer Mohammad Vafakhah put it.
The pavement of the Woodland Hills street where the 51-year-old and
his family live is "like alligator skin," he said.</TE>
<TE>   West Hills private investigator Jay Rosenzweig said he has watched
a new barbecue restaurant near his office jump through burdensome
hoops to secure building and liquor permits. Rosenzweig, 42, wants to
"bring city government to your doorstep."</TE>
<TE>   "It can't get worse," he said. "It can only get better."</TE>

<HD>Growth Seems to Be the Hot Issue in Ventura County</HD>

<LD>Voting in sweeping restrictions over growth in the last few years,
Ventura County residents opted to bypass their elected officials and
seize control of major decisions on development.</LD>
<LD>   On Nov. 5, they will flex their newfound muscle in a big way for
the first time.</LD>
<LD>   Voters will also choose a raft of city council members, school
board leaders and legislators, but the hottest items on the ballot
focus on massive new neighborhoods proposed in Ventura, Simi Valley
and Santa Paula.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, residents of Ojai will decide on tough limits on the
traffic that growth there would generate.</TE>
<TE>   As developers have poured more than $1.5 million into their
advertising campaigns, less-richly funded citizens' groups have
countered with phone campaigns, public-access TV spots and yard
signs. By contrast, most of the races for local office have been
tepid, spurring comparatively little spending or voter interest.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, the state's recent, once-a-decade redistricting
has made most incumbents in both the Legislature and Congress even
more secure.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like a stealth election," said Herb Gooch, a political
analyst and professor of government at Cal Lutheran University in
Thousand Oaks. "There isn't much political fervor up and down the
state, and in Ventura County, you don't have exciting candidacies.
The turnout is apt to be very low, so whoever can best organize on
the ground is liable to do well."</TE>
<TE>   Voters in nine of the county's 10 cities will select council
members. Seats on 12 of the county's school boards also will be up
for grabs. Three positions are available on the Ventura County
Community College District board, a group that was widely criticized
in a financial scandal involving former Chancellor Philip Westin.</TE>
<TE>   On the state and federal levels, challengers are trying to unseat
four Assembly members and two members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the precinct-walking and candidate forum sound bites,
the election seems to be as much about a few rugged patches of
sage-studded ground as anything.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, county voters overwhelmingly passed the Save Open Space
and Agricultural Resources measure -- a first-in-the-nation law
mandating public approval to rezone farmland for development. Similar
measures have been passed in nearly all of the county's cities, but
this is the first time such laws have faced a significant test.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, Measure A would allow 1,390 homes in six neighborhoods
spread over the hillsides and canyons that serve as a backdrop for
the city. In return, the owners of the land would give a land trust
80% of their property -- some 3,000 acres of permanently protected
open space, which would be laced with hiking trails.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal from Lloyd Properties, a family partnership behind
the measure, has sparked bitter personal attacks and a host of
dramatically conflicting claims. Supporters are pitching the project,
which would be built over 15 to 20 years, as environmentally
sensitive and visually appealing. Opponents contend it would blight
the hillsides with ticky-tacky subdivisions and cause traffic
nightmares on the narrow roads nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also contend that approval would give developers a blank
check because they have yet to complete required environmental and
financial studies. The landowners counter that their plans still
would need approval by the city before construction could begin. City
officials agree with the landowners.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Lutheran's Gooch said low voter participation might favor
opponents of Measure A.</TE>
<TE>   "The people opposed are very passionate," he said, "and with a low
turnout, their small numbers will be magnified. And absentees could
be one-third of the vote; these tend to be people who have been
around the longest and are the most stable. And that could give the
edge to the anti-development side."</TE>
<TE>   In Simi Valley, Measure B would shrink the area in which growth
could occur, effectively killing proposals for 1,600 homes and an
industrial business park in Alamos Canyon just north of the Ronald
Reagan Freeway. It also would stop a 550-unit development in Runkle
Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the measure argue against the developments on
environmental grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "What our community should be looking at for Alamos Canyon is a
site for a regional park, not a huge commercial and industrial
development," said Kevin Conville. "It's sick."</TE>
<TE>   But opponents contend that the measure would unfairly change the
SOAR boundaries approved by voters in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Four years ago they came up with a line that everyone could live
with, allowing the city to grow and prosper and also giving the SOAR
folks some confidence," said Rondi Guthrie, an official with the
California Building Industry Assn.'s local branch. "Now they're
trying to tighten it. If it passes here, then no doubt they'll move
on to the next city."</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Paula, Measure F would effectively double the city's
area, allowing construction of 1,980 homes, 180 condominiums, two
schools, hotels and a shopping center in outlying Adams Canyon, now
mostly grazing land.</TE>
<TE>   If the measure is approved, the city stands to reap as much as
$2.5 million annually in taxes and fees -- a substantial sum for a
local government perennially stretched thin. But opponents argue that
Santa Paula would do better to grow within than to spread out.</TE>
<TE>   Higher-density housing could help revitalize the city's struggling
downtown, said Mike Miller, a leader of the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not bleary-eyed utopianism," he said. "It's happening all
over the country."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Measure F, Santa Paula voters will fill three
council seats and decide whether to carve the city into five council
districts.</TE>
<TE>   As in every other city in Ventura County, council members in Santa
Paula do not represent specific neighborhoods. But at-large
representation has helped limit the number of Latino council members
in a city that is two-thirds Latino, the U.S. Department of Justice
charged in a lawsuit two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has been a divisive one. Last December, eight-year
Councilwoman Laura Flores Espinosa was snubbed for the ceremonial
mayor's post because she supported the federal lawsuit. Espinosa is
in the race as a write-in candidate this year, having missed the
deadline for filing her election papers.</TE>
<TE>   Also running are incumbent Rick Cook; former Mayor Al Escoto; high
school teacher Gabino Aguirre; land-use planner Rita Graham; urban
planner Mary Ann Krause; and real estate agent John Wisda.</TE>
<TE>   In a number of other council races, the battle lines are drawn
over growth.</TE>
<TE>   In Simi Valley, Measure B has emerged as a campaign issue, with
incumbents Bill Davis, Paul Miller and Glen T. Becerra opposing the
move to increase SOAR's influence.</TE>
<TE>   Four other candidates are vying for the three seats on the
council. They are mayoral candidates Jim Mackelburg and David R.
Plunkett and council candidates Paul Luna Delgado and Brian E.
Wilson. In Thousand Oaks, a four-candidate slate calls itself the
Certified Slow-Growth Team and contends that the three incumbents up
for reelection have been too kind to builders seeking a berth in the
affluent suburb.</TE>
<TE>   The incumbents are Andy Fox, Dan Del Campo and Dennis Gillette. A
fourth seat is also open as Linda Parks, the hands-down leader of the
city's slow-growth movement, leaves to join the Ventura County Board
of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The self-proclaimed slow-growth slate consists of restaurant owner
Bob Wilson Sr., Planning Commissioner Claudia Bill-de la Pena, former
Planning Commissioner Michael Farris and English teacher Laura Lee
Custodio.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates are Randy Hoffman, a millionaire businessman who
lost his bid for county supervisor to Parks; retired aerospace
engineer Don Morris; David Seagal, a structural engineer making his
third council run; TV producer David Sams; and health care executive
Rick Velasquez.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, which has accommodated growth more readily than most
Ventura County cities, some candidates question how the city can
afford to provide services for the new developments already sprouting
as well as the 2,800-home RiverPark development approved earlier this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't just grow for the sake of growing," said candidate Saul
Medina, a psychiatric social worker who has been active on various
city commissions. Candidate Susan Komar, a local business owner, went
a step further, calling for a two-year moratorium on development in
the city.</TE>
<TE>   Nine candidates are competing for two seats.</TE>
<TE>   Among sitting council members, Dean Maulhardt is running again but
Tom Holden is not. Mayor Manuel Lopez, a 24-year council veteran, is
unopposed.</TE>
<TE>   The other candidates are Komar, Medina, former Councilman Andres
Herrera; Planning Commission Chairman Al Duff; elementary school
teacher Alex Escobell; communications technician Tim Hammons; retired
real estate agent Martin Jones and ticket agent Elias Banales. In
Ventura County's congressional races, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi
Valley) is expected to win easily over public relations consultant
Fern Rudin, a first-time candidate from Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   An eight-term congressman, Gallegly said he has a bit more than $1
million available for his campaign. Rudin, who said she accepted the
candidacy three days before the filing deadline, had collected less
than $1,000 by the end of September.</TE>
<TE>   Redistricting tightened Gallegly's grasp on his district, adding
to it GOP-dominated turf in Lompoc and inland Santa Barbara County.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara) is facing a challenger who is
better-funded and more well-known than Gallegly's. Beth Rogers, a
member of a wealthy, fourth-generation Ventura County farming family,
has a campaign treasury of at least $1.2 million -- about the same as
Capps'.</TE>
<TE>   While Capps drew former President Bill Clinton to a fund-raiser on
her behalf, Rogers offered donors a chance to rub shoulders with
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).</TE>
<TE>   Rogers is a conservative on issues such as taxation and is fluent
in Spanish -- which she believes will serve her well with Latino
voters in a district that spans the coast from San Luis Obispo to
Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a large bloc of voters out there that will identify with
me because I identify with them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Capps, a two-term incumbent who won a special
election after the death of her husband, Walter Capps, is well known
in a district where 45% of voters are registered as Democrats and 33%
as Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   In the county's Assembly races, Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa
Barbara) faces less opposition than she anticipated. Her Republican
challenger, Bob Pohl, was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer and dropped
out of the race Sept. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Like other incumbents, Rep. Keith Richman stands to benefit from
redistricting in his race against poorly funded Paula Calderon.
Spanning Simi Valley, the Santa Clarita Valley and a portion of the
San Fernando Valley, his district is solidly Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Rep. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) is running in a
district with even more Democrats registered now than before its
boundaries were changed to include Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   In her race against Michael Wissot, the first-term legislator is
counting on a 49% to 31% advantage in registered Democrats over
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   That is also the case with Rep. Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark). At
32 the youngest Assembly member, he is seeking his third and final
term in a district where voter registration is 46% Republican and 35%
Democratic. His Democratic challenger, financial advisor Bruce
Thomas, raised $17,000 by the end of September, compared with
Strickland's $277,000.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Fans Kick Up Their Heels at Victory</HD>
<DH>Soccer aficionados cheer the former also-rans, now the
national champions, at Staples.</DH>

<LD>Jennifer Porras couldn't hold back a scream when she saw her idol,
the dreadlocked soccer player she's been following on TV since she
was 9, bound into Staples Center wearing mirrored sunglasses and a
huge, toothy smile.</LD>
<LD>   "Cobi!" the Norwalk 16-year-old shrieked, her joyful cry skimming
over waves of booming applause. "Co-bi! Co-bi! Co-bi!"</LD>
<LD>   Cobi Jones, team captain of the long-suffering Galaxy, pumped his
fist in the air as fans let loose their jubilation after seven years
of frustration. After losing the Major League Soccer finals three
times since 1996, Los Angeles finally claimed the MLS Cup last
weekend in a tight match that ended in sudden death overtime.</LD>
<TE>   Scoring the winning goal against the New England Revolution was
Carlos Ruiz, the 23-year-old Guatemalan striker named the league's
most valuable player. Ruiz signed on with the Galaxy as a discovery
pick in February.</TE>
<TE>   For Porras and about 6,000 other fans who toasted the team
Saturday at the downtown arena, it was about time.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally!" said Jose Avendano, a 35-year-old inventory clerk from
South-Central Los Angeles. "Carlos Ruiz wasn't a big-money, big-name
player. We suddenly got this kid out of nowhere, and he made it
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Giddy fans in oversized aqua-and-yellow shirts waved Guatemalan
flags as the pulsing beat of "Livin' la Vida Loca" filled the arena.
Parents hoisted kids in tiny Galaxy uniforms onto their shoulders for
a better view.</TE>
<TE>   The noise swelled to a deafening roar as the players trooped in,
dressed down for the occasion in jeans and black golf shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like the fourth time was the charm," said Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn, who took the podium to welcome the team home. He
ticked off the names of L.A.'s other recent winners, from the
three-peat Lakers to the two-time WNBA titleholders, the Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a city of champions!" Hahn shouted in Spanish to the
predominantly Latino crowd. "Viva Galaxy!"</TE>
<TE>   Ezra Hendrickson, the defender named the team's MVP in 2001, gave
an emotional thank you to the fans who never abandoned the struggling
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to thank you guys ... for inviting us to your party,"
he said. "I remember many times we came up without it, but you stuck
with us. Your loyalty throughout the years was an inspiration." The
hourlong celebration also saw a long-standing wager settled. Galaxy
defender Alexi Lalas had promised to buy Ruiz a watch if he scored
more than 15 goals this year.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz wound up netting a league-high 24 goals during the regular
season. Lalas couldn't make it to Saturday's bash, but he still made
good on his word: Another teammate presented Ruiz with a shiny gold
Rolex.</TE>
<TE>   "This coming year, we'll have a new song," Ruiz told the crowd in
Spanish. "Champions, champions, champions!"</TE>

<LD>Former county prosecutor and criminal defense attorney George C.
Eskin has been awarded the 2002 Woodruff J. Deem Medal of Justice
Award in recognition of his more than 30 years of legal service.</LD>
<LD>   Retiring Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury
established the award to honor individuals who have made outstanding
contributions to the administration of justice. Eskin, 64, served as
assistant district attorney to Deem in the 1960s. He was also a trial
lawyer, handling civil and criminal matters before retiring in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   "As one who was hired by Woody Deem," Eskin said, "and who had the
utmost admiration for him as a trial attorney and a human being, I am
extremely honored that Mike Bradbury has seen fit to perpetuate his
memory and to name me as a recipient of this award."</LD>
<TE>   The award will be presented during a ceremony Monday at the

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities on Saturday were searching for two masked men who robbed
a Bank of America branch of an undisclosed amount of money.</LD>
<LD>   The holdup occurred shortly after 11 a.m. in the 2300 block of
Borchard Road. Ventura County sheriff's deputies said the pair
entered the bank and yelled at everyone to get down. Then they hopped
over the main service counter and grabbed cash from several teller
drawers.</LD>
<LD>   The pair left in a white pickup truck, which was found abandoned
nearby a short time later. The truck had been stolen earlier in the
day in the San Fernando Valley. Two ski masks and a small amount of
cash were found inside.</LD>
<TE>   Six employees and three customers were in the bank when the
robbery occurred, but no one was injured. No weapons were seen during
the heist.</TE>

<LD>On Marva Joyce Wallace's first day of freedom Saturday, it wasn't the
price of the four JC Penney bra-and-panty sets that struck her as
strange.</LD>
<LD>   It was the money.</LD>
<LD>   Standing at a department store checkout counter, she stared for a
second at $100 and $5 bills in her hands. When change, in the form of
52 cents, arrived, she fumbled again.</LD>
<TE>   The quarters confused her. The bills had a new, off-center design.</TE>
<TE>   "It's strange--everything looks so different," said Wallace, 48,
who has spent most of the last 17 years at the California Institution
for Women in Corona after being convicted of killing her abusive
husband in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David S. Wesley
overturned her murder conviction and released her from prison. He
ruled that the outcome of Wallace's trial might have been different
had battered women's syndrome been allowed to be used in her defense.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace is believed to be the first inmate released under a new
California law that allows inmates to file habeas corpus petitions in
cases in which evidence of the syndrome was not permitted at trial.
She may still, however, face a new trial.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, who is called Joyce by her family, spent Saturday
surrounded by aunts and cousins, brothers and sisters and the many
nieces and nephews who were born during her imprisonment. Neighbors
and friends arrived in a steady stream, many of them within minutes
of hearing or reading of Wallace's release.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't wait," said Gloria Davis, a church friend of the
family, as she leaped from her car to give Wallace a hug. Davis,
wearing all black except for an animal print hat tilted at an angle,
said she had been on her way to a funeral when she heard the news on
the radio. "I stopped the car and said, 'Thank you, Jesus.' I almost
got in an accident."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace started the morning with a pancake breakfast at her
mother's home on 102nd Street in Los Angeles. Then, dressed in an
off-white shirt and khaki cargo pants that she had borrowed from a
niece, she went on a mini shopping spree at a nearby mall.</TE>
<TE>   Underwire bras were a priority: They had been forbidden inside the
prison. Skirts and dresses in earth tones were also on the list --
anything that would be different from the jeans and gray T-shirt that
had long been her uniform.</TE>
<TE>   As Wallace called out her sizes to her mother, Deloris Wallace,
and aunt, Julia Richardson, the three women plucked items off shelves
with glee. "It's your day," said Deloris, as Joyce wondered whether
she should buy a black or brown purse.</TE>
<TE>   She went with the brown.</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs, in Penney's lingerie section, she picked out three sets
of matching bras and underwear, in leopard print, purple and royal
blue, "my favorite color."</TE>
<TE>   Strolling the aisles of a boutique, she chose a long-sleeve tan
sweater and a matching calf-length skirt. She paid for the items
without ever bothering to try them on -- a sign, perhaps, that she is
accepting her newfound freedom.</TE>
<TE>   She can always exchange.</TE>
<TE>   As the women walked through the mall, Wallace marveled at how much
the place had changed. It was a theme that ran throughout the day.
"Everything seems much bigger now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The tree in front of her mother's house "was a little stub when I
left." Now, it reaches far above the garage of the stuccoed house.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Honey, there've been so many changes,' " confided her
mother. "She's just getting used to the scenery."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace had learned that morning how to operate a cordless
telephone. She said she would soon learn to ride the Green and Blue
lines and drive the Century Freeway, which had sprung up near her
mother's house. Accustoming herself to a world with blue Pepsi and
juice bottles shaped like superheroes might take longer.</TE>
<TE>   But it was easy, she said, to slip back into her role as sister,
daughter and niece. In prison, weekends had been a lonely blur of
laundry and television, a small relief from the long hours that
Wallace put in working construction for the Inmate Day Labor Service.
She learned how to crochet, make ceramics and build baskets out of
pine needles and palm fronds.</TE>
<TE>   She rarely saw her children, who were 3 and 7 when she was
convicted. Her favorite grandmother died while she was in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Within two months of her marriage to Glendell Boykin, she said, he
began beating her, often for being absent from the home and after
visits by relatives. She testified Oct. 10 that she felt there was no
way to escape. "He told me if I ever tried to leave him again he
would kill me."</TE>
<TE>   She shot him to death and was sentenced to a first-degree murder
sentence of 27 years to life. Two weeks ago, Gov. Gray Davis denied
Wallace parole, reversing a recommendation of the state Board of
Prison Terms. Wallace said she expected the governor's decision,
"especially now, with the elections. He wasn't going to let anyone
out."</TE>
<TE>   The law allowing abused women to petition the court went into
effect in 2001. It was "what I was waiting for," she said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   On her first day of freedom, Wallace said she was learning how to
be a grandmother to Deon, 4, the son of her son, Jessie Martin. Deon
rarely visited her in prison. As he rode a red-and-white bicycle with
training wheels in a tight circle around Deloris Wallace's driveway,
Joyce kept a protective eye trained on him.</TE>
<TE>   "She blended in yesterday like it was the day before" the slaying
that sent her to prison, said sister Andrea Wallace, 37.</TE>
<TE>   For most of Joyce's imprisonment, Andrea said, the family often
told people that she was living out of town or working as a
stewardess. Her return, Andrea said, has helped to heal a family that
has never quite been the same since what mother Deloris calls "the
accident."</TE>
<TE>   "What she went through, I went through," said sister Ruby Wallace,
38, who visited Joyce two or three times a month, as often as she was
allowed by the prison.</TE>
<TE>   She said she took her sister family pictures and kept her up to
date on current events and changes within their large family. "I told
her I'd be with her till the end.... I figured, if she can go through
it in there, I can make it out here, with everything that's going
on."</TE>
<TE>   There were moments, throughout the day, when Joyce Wallace reached
out to grab her younger sister and hold her tight.</TE>
<TE>   At those times, there were more tears than words to share.</TE>
<TE>   "I still don't know how to feel," Wallace said at one point.</TE>
<TE>   There is still some uncertainty in her future; she is due back in
court Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office said Friday that it had not decided
whether to try her case again.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's attorney, Michael Brennan, told The Times that he
expected the two sides to settle without a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace was certainly making plans, however, for the rest of her
life.</TE>
<TE>   After years working construction as an inmate, making 95 cents an
hour, she said she's entertaining two more-lucrative job offers, one
as a plumber and the other working for a delivery service.</TE>
<TE>   She also hopes to spend time serving as an advocate for other
battered women.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know about shelters or hotlines," she said. "I was all
alone.... I didn't know any other way. If I can prevent that, I'm
more than happy to do it."</TE>
<TE>   But before any of that, she has a more pressing engagement, one
she hopes the judge will allow her to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter, Keshawna, who was 3 when she left for prison, will
be married Nov. 9 in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace is hoping to walk her daughter down the aisle.</TE>

<LD>More than 50 years after becoming the first person to break the sound
barrier, Chuck Yeager did it one last time before retiring from his
long career of test-piloting military aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   The aviation legend said he has no regrets about walking away from
60-plus years of flying the military's newest and most innovative
planes.</LD>
<LD>   "It was interfering with my hunting and fishing," he joked after
the era-closing flyover at the annual Edwards Air Force Base air
show. "All good things must come to an end."</LD>
<TE>   Still in good health at 79, he said he'll continue fly, but only
small, non-military planes. His new mission is to introduce young
people to military flying through the General Chuck Yeager
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was probably the last guy who will get to do the kind of flying
I did," said the retired Air Force brigadier general.</TE>
<TE>   After shooting down at least a dozen German planes in World War
II, he was assigned to a flight test facility in Ohio, where his
flying skills caught the attention of a top officer. He was selected
to pilot the experimental Bell X-1, and in 1947 he broke the
near-mythical sound barrier during a flight out of Muroc Army Field,
now Edwards Air Force Base. After that he flew "about every kind of
plane they had in the military," he said, flying as fast as Mach 3.2.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1975, when he left active duty with the Air Force, he's
tested the latest flying equipment as a dollar-a-year consultant for
Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   Now that he'll be spending more time on the ground, his immediate
plans are to "go elk hunting in Oregon next week."</TE>

<HD>Yeager's Career Ends on High Note</HD>
<DH>Aviation legend breaks sound barrier one last time. 'All

<LD>More than 50 years after becoming the first person to break the sound
barrier, Chuck Yeager did it one last time before retiring from his
long career of test-piloting military aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   The aviation legend said he has no regrets about walking away from
60-plus years of flying the military's newest and most innovative
planes.</LD>
<LD>   "It was interfering with my hunting and fishing," he joked after
the era-closing flyover at the annual Edwards Air Force Base air
show. "All good things must come to an end."</LD>
<TE>   Yeager's flight was the opening act of Saturday's air show,
featuring exhibits of B-1, B-52, F-117A and other aircraft. The crowd
was also treated to aerial acts such as a fighter attack
demonstration and a team parachute jump.</TE>
<TE>   There might be days when Yeager will miss his role as an Air Force
advisor who helps perfect targeting, infrared and other technology,
he said. "But I've never been addicted to flying, because to me, it's
been my duty. I can walk away and say, 'Man, I had a ball, but I've
got something else to do.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still in good health at 79, he said he'll continue fly, but only
small, non-military planes. His new mission is to introduce young
people to military flying through the General Chuck Yeager
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was probably the last guy who will get to do the kind of flying
I did," said the retired Air Force brigadier general. "I came into
the military as an 18-year-old kid before World War II, never having
been in an airplane, never having even seen one on the ground. It
turned into quite an opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   After shooting down at least a dozen German planes in World War
II, he was assigned to a flight test facility in Ohio, where his
flying skills caught the attention of a top officer. He was selected
to pilot the experimental Bell X-1, and in 1947 he broke the
near-mythical sound barrier during a flight out of Muroc Army Field,
now Edwards Air Force Base. After that he flew "about every kind of
plane they had in the military," he said, flying as fast as Mach 3.2.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1975, when he left active duty with the Air Force, he's
tested the latest flying equipment as a dollar-a-year consultant for
Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   "The other day I said to Maj. Gen. Doug Pearson, the head of the
flight test center here, 'That's $27 you owe me,' and the general
said back to me, 'Well, maybe we ought to see how much you owe us in
jet fuel.' I said, 'Ah, oh well.' "</TE>
<TE>   No one was begrudging Yeager any jet fuel Saturday. During his
half-hour farewell flight, about 75,000 air show visitors squinted at
leaden skies, hoping to catch a glimpse through the clouds of his
F-15 Eagle.</TE>
<TE>   Yeager flew at 30,000 feet in tandem with his old friend, NASA
shuttle astronaut Joe Engle, in an identical craft.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly the pair's contrails came into view and two nearly
simultaneous sonic booms thundered as the fliers broke the sound
barrier.</TE>
<TE>   "We got up to Mach 1.5," Yeager said. "We didn't want to go too
much faster. That would put too much energy into the shock wave, and
it'll break windows."</TE>

advisor who helps perfect targeting, infrared and other technology,
he said. "But I've never been addicted to flying, because to me, it's
been my duty. I can walk away and say, 'Man, I had a ball, but I've
got something else to do.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still in good health at 79, he said he'll continue fly, but only
small, non-military planes. His new mission is to introduce young
people to military flying through the General Chuck Yeager
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was probably the last guy who will get to do the kind of flying
I did," said the retired Air Force brigadier general. "I came into
the military as an 18-year-old kid before World War II, never having
been in an airplane, never having even seen one on the ground. It
turned into quite an opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   After shooting down at least a dozen German planes in World War
II, he was assigned to a flight test facility in Ohio, where his
flying skills caught the attention of a top officer. He was selected
to pilot the experimental Bell X-1, and in 1947 he broke the
near-mythical sound barrier during a flight out of Muroc Army Field,
now Edwards Air Force Base. After that he flew "about every kind of
plane they had in the military," he said, flying as fast as Mach 3.2.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1975, when he left active duty with the Air Force, he's
tested the latest flying equipment as a dollar-a-year consultant for
Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   "The other day I said to Maj. Gen. Doug Pearson, the head of the
flight test center here, 'That's $27 you owe me,' and the general
said back to me, 'Well, maybe we ought to see how much you owe us in
jet fuel.' I said, 'Ah, oh well.' "</TE>
<TE>   No one was begrudging Yeager any jet fuel Saturday. During his
half-hour farewell flight, about 75,000 air show visitors squinted at
leaden skies, hoping to catch a glimpse through the clouds of his
F-15 Eagle.</TE>
<TE>   Yeager flew at 30,000 feet in tandem with his old friend, NASA
shuttle astronaut Joe Engle, in an identical craft.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly the pair's contrails came into view and two nearly
simultaneous sonic booms thundered as the fliers broke the sound
barrier.</TE>
<TE>   "We got up to Mach 1.5," Yeager said. "We didn't want to go too
much faster. That would put too much energy into the shock wave, and
it'll break windows."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't allow himself any nostalgic thoughts while he was aloft,
or spend any time admiring the blue sky above the cloud cover, he
said. "I really don't think a lot [about anything] outside the
cockpit. What's outside the cockpit will kill you. Just like when
you're driving a car. You can't be thinking too hard about what
you're having for dinner."</TE>
<TE>   Now that he'll be spending more time on the ground, his immediate
plans are to "go elk hunting in Oregon next week."</TE>

<HD>Sultana Girls Conquer Mt. SAC With Ease</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hesperia Sultana performed like one of the top girls' cross-country
teams in the nation Saturday by posting a runaway victory in the team
sweepstakes race of the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational.</LD>
<LD>   Sultana, the No. 3-ranked team in Harrier magazine's national
poll, totaled 62 points with No. 12 Murrieta Valley second with 93
points.</LD>
<LD>   Canyon Country Canyon was third with 145 points, followed by Santa
Rosa Montgomery with 153 and defending state Division II champion
Escondido San Pasqual with 156.</LD>
<TE>   Sultana placed fourth in the state Division II final last year
after being hampered by injuries. But the Sultans have remained
healthy this season and their performances have shown it.</TE>
<TE>   They dominated the Division II race of the Stanford Invitational
on Sept. 28 and defeated Murrieta Valley in the Inland Empire
Challenge on Oct. 12.</TE>
<TE>   The cumulative time of their top five runners Saturday was 91
minutes 21 seconds, a record for the 2.91-mile course that has been
in use at Mt. SAC since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Kelsey Delagardelle placed third overall in 17:49 for
Sultana and freshman teammate Danielle Varela was fourth in 17:52.</TE>
<TE>   "We just wanted to get back out here on the course," Coach Jon
Mahr said. "We wanted to see what we could do."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly defeated Los Angeles Loyola, 113-135, for the
boys' team title. Dana Point Dana Hills was third with 152 points and
defending sweepstakes and state Division I champion Canyon Country
Canyon was fourth with 171.</TE>
<TE>   "Our [tight] group saved us," Poly Coach George Wright said.
"Loyola had two runners ahead of our top man, but we had six runners
ahead of their fourth finisher and that did it for us."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Kevin Brulois led Poly with a 13th-place time of 15:21 and
junior teammate Ulices Pina was 17th in 15:25.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Tim Nelson of Redding Liberty Christian and junior Rachel
Bryan of Elk Grove Laguna Creek won the boys' and girls' races.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson passed juniors Troy Swier of San Diego Mar Vista and
Mohamed Trafeh of Duarte in the final 400 yards to win the boys'
individual sweepstakes in 14:33, only five seconds off the course
record of 14:28 set by Ryan Hall of Big Bear in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan won the girls' individual sweepstakes in 17:08 after surging
to an early lead.</TE>

<TE>   A Southern Section rule set to take effect next fall that will
require athletes who transfer without a change of residence to sit
out a year may be modified to conform with the new "No Child Left
Behind" federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Section Commissioner Jim Staunton said discussions are expected to
take place on possibly amending the rule so it doesn't conflict with
the new law.</TE>
<TE>   One of the key features of the law offers students the opportunity
to transfer from under-performing schools to better ones in the same
district, based on standardized test scores.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Southern Section has reported that more than 600
athletes switched schools as of Sept. 30, far fewer than the 7,331
who filed transfer requests as of June.</TE>
<TE>   Staunton said the smaller number of students who transferred may
be an indication of parents' having second thoughts over the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "The only explanation I can give is there was a considerable
amount of school shopping," he said. "I believe that transferring for
a kid can be very traumatic. Maybe they didn't spot an advantage
going elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   The large number of transfer requests came after the Southern
Section passed its rule requiring athletes who transfer but don't
change residences to sit out one year effective next fall.</TE>

<HD>Los Alamitos Stands Tall</HD>
<DH>No. 4 Griffins rally for 16-12 Sunset League victory over
No. 8 Esperanza as Barnes ties Orange County record with 212th win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Alamitos High all but clinched its second consecutive Sunset
League title Saturday night by rallying to defeat Anaheim Esperanza,
16-12, at Placentia Valencia High.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Jeff Kline scored on a one-yard plunge midway through
the fourth quarter to provide the winning margin for the Griffins
(6-0-1, 2-0), No. 4 in The Times' rankings.</LD>
<LD>   The victory allowed Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes to tie former
Santa Ana Valley, Santa Ana and Orange Coach Dick Hill as the
winningest football coach in Orange County history. Each coach has
212 victories.</LD>
<TE>   "The win is a lot more important than the milestone," Barnes said.
"The milestone is one of those things I'll look back on when I'm 70
and think it's wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   The victory was especially impressive considering it came against
No. 8 Esperanza (6-1, 1-1), which was averaging 42 points.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 12-10, Los Alamitos struggled to move the ball for much
of the second half. The Griffins went three and out on their first
two possessions, and Esperanza took over at the Los Alamitos 42-yard
line early in the fourth quarter clinging to its two-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   But the Aztecs moved 20 yards backward before giving the ball back
to the Griffins, who went 68 yards in seven plays to take the lead
for good on Kline's touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos receiver Brandon Tripp intercepted a Rick Taloa pass
with 1 minute 57 seconds left to preserve the victory for the
Griffins, who tied Huntington Beach Edison for the league title last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I could read [Taloa's] eyes," said Tripp, who also caught seven
passes for 85 yards, "and he just threw the ball right to me."</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Childs scored Los Alamitos' other touchdown on a 16-yard
pass from Kline in the first quarter. Kevin Gamarnik's 29-yard field
goal early in the second quarter made it 10-0.</TE>
<TE>   Esperanza cut its deficit to 10-6 when tight end John Pace scored
on a five-yard pass from Taloa. The Aztecs took the lead in the third
quarter when Shaun Wildenstein (132 yards in 22 carries) scored on a
one-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   Kline completed 16 of 24 passes for 189 yards. Receiver Jeremy
Childs was the recipient of six of those passes for 91 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Bagley rushed for 120 yards in 17 carries for Los Alamitos.</TE>

<HD>It Could Use a Tweak, but Title IX Is Needed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a reevaluation of Title IX, the landmark legislation enacted
30 years ago that prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded
education programs, taking place.</LD>
<LD>   A panel of sports professionals and educators, formed at the
request of the secretary of education, Rod Paige, has been hearing
testimony on ways to improve Title IX, which is credited with
revolutionizing sports opportunities for female athletes.</LD>
<LD>   There have been growing complaints that the law has led to reverse
discrimination with the elimination of men's teams.</LD>
<TE>   But those who think parity has arrived in women's sports and
question the remaining need for Title IX have only to be aware of
what happened at Los Angeles University High last January.</TE>
<TE>   After years of neglect of the school's softball program and a
failure by adults to take appropriate action, Stephanie Varlotta, a
senior player, filed a Title IX complaint with the Los Angeles
Unified School District's office of Educational Equity Compliance.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with overwhelming evidence that the school was in violation
of gender equity rules, Varlotta forced administrators to sign a
compliance agreement to make major changes in the softball program.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, University has fulfilled its commitment. An
off-season softball fundamentals class, which is similar to a class
baseball players have always had, will be offered beginning next
month. The softball field, which once had a broken pitching rubber,
no dugouts and was considered a heath hazard, has been transformed
into one of the best in the Western League.</TE>
<TE>   Enclosed dugouts with wood roofs and cement floors were erected.
The outfield was re-sodded with hybrid Bermuda grass and is no longer
available for anyone and everyone to tear up with endless use.</TE>
<TE>   "The field is amazing, but to get that class is really going to
help the team," Varlotta said. "Now it's giving them a chance against
teams that play over the summer."</TE>
<TE>   University still hasn't put up an electronic scoreboard at the
softball field, like there is at the baseball field, but
administrators are committed to raising funds to complete the project
in a reasonable time.</TE>
<TE>   Elois McGehee, University's first-year principal, has made it
clear to her coaching staff that following gender equity rules is
"something important to me."</TE>
<TE>   "I do regret it had to come to a student filing a complaint for
action to be taken," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Another school close to rectifying a Title IX complaint is Granada
Hills Kennedy, which opened in 1971 and has never had a softball
field on campus. The school is scheduled to complete building a
softball field by the spring of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Varlotta graduated last June and won't be able to benefit from the
changes in University's softball program. She's attending Syracuse,
but her legacy can be seen in the renewed enthusiasm and
opportunities for University softball players.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be happy until it's all done, until the
scoreboard is up, until the coaching staff stays stable," Varlotta
said. "I realize I started something, and I'm going to finish it even
if it takes two years."</TE>
<TE>   It took Varlotta's courage and indignation to speed up the process
of change, but without Title IX, the softball team might be waiting
years for fairness to prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Title IX may require some tweaking, but it's still needed in a
time when gender equity problems continue to exist.</TE>

<HD>Kwan Takes Skating Title</HD>
<DH>In men's competition, Yagudin withdraws at Skate America
because of hip problem that could threaten career.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>SPOKANE, Wash.</DL>
<LD>On a night when the competitive skating future of Olympic champion
Alexei Yagudin appeared in doubt, Michelle Kwan was back to her
winning ways.</LD>
<LD>   Kwan won her seventh Skate America title Saturday night, only a
week after she agreed to be a last-minute fill-in for injured Sarah
Hughes.</LD>
<LD>   With a fall and another botched jump, it certainly wasn't Kwan's
best program. But with everyone else bumbling and stumbling, it was
more than enough to win.</LD>
<TE>   "This was icky," Kwan said, grimacing and screwing up her nose.
"And I've been feeling great all week."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin, who dropped out of the competition because of a chronic
hip problem, was anything but great.</TE>
<TE>   "I am worried because it's just like darkness in front of me," he
said. "I really believe I will be back. I want that. I will be back."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin, who turns 23 in March, said Friday that he has a
degenerative hip defect that could force him into early retirement.
The socket in his right hip doesn't cover the bone completely, so the
two rub together and cause painful irritation.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's competition, Ann Patrice McDonough and Ukraine's
Elena Liashenko crashed in warmup, but it didn't hurt either of them.
McDonough, the world junior champion last year, was second and
Liashenko was third.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Kirk, who had been in second after the short program,
dropped to fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Yukari Nakano of Japan and Ludmila Nelidina of Russia caused a
stir by landing triple axels within half an hour of each other.
They're the first women to do the jump in international competition
since Midori Ito at the 1992 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw one in warmup and I was like, was that a ... ? Wow!" Kwan
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the men's competition, Yagudin with drew just before he was to
skate Saturday night. In his absence, Brian Joubert of France won the
title.</TE>
<TE>   Five days ago, Yagudin was expressing relief that the pain in his
right hip seemed to be going away.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, after winning the men's short program at Skate
America, Yagudin said the pain had returned with an intensity that
makes him feel his competitive career could be ending.</TE>
<TE>   The 22-year-old Russian, figure skating's leading man since the
1998 world championships, will seek opinions from a number of
doctors, starting Monday with orthopedist Jeffrey Abrams in
Princeton, N.J. Yagudin expects to withdraw from the Skate Canada
event next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin said another doctor had told him that "It can damage me
the rest of my life. I have to sit down and think what is the best
thing to do. I have a big question in front of me."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin, world champion four of the past five years, said he has
seen a number of doctors since the hip began bothering him last
December.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent came here Thursday, when Yagudin said he was given
an anti-inflammatory injection for the pain.</TE>
<TE>   According to Yagudin's agent, Dmitri Goryachkin of IMG, Spokane
orthopedic surgeon Thomas Halvorson said he suspected Yagudin has a
congenital problem with the bone socket at his hip.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born like this, it wasn't something I damaged by skating,"
Yagudin said. "The doctor said if I was not an athlete, it could
cause problems in the future, when I was 50, 60 years old. I could
not imagine at age 22 I would have serious problems."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin said one doctor would have advised him to quit skating
already if he were not so talented.</TE>
<TE>   "I've won everything, but it's so hard to find the right moment to
stop," Yagudin said.</TE>
<TE>   In ice dancing, Elena Grushina and Ruslan Goncharov of Ukraine
staged a minor upset by winning. Galit Chait and Sergei Sakhnovski,
favored to win here after taking the bronze medal at the world
championships last spring, were a surprising fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Tatiana Navka and Roman Kostamorov of Russia were second.</TE>

<HD>Still Making the Most of Good Thing</HD>
<DH>Chastain, Fawcett, Foudy, Hamm and Lilly bring the U.S.
women's national team championship experience that has been 14-plus
years in the making.</DH>

<LD>Forget that battery-powered rabbit on television. The ones who really
keep on going and going and going are the five veterans on the U.S.
women's national soccer team.</LD>
<LD>   One of them, Brandi Chastain, tried to explain the other day just
what it is that keeps her and teammates Joy Fawcett, Julie Foudy, Mia
Hamm and Kristine Lilly at the peak of their game more than 14 years
after they made their respective debuts for the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   "If you look at the names on the U.S. roster, we've got Heather
O'Reilly, who is 17 years old," Chastain said. "I've got to chase her
around the field. So that's how I keep my excitement and my edge.</LD>
<TE>   "There are a lot of young players out there who would just be
thrilled with the opportunity to participate on the national team
level. My job is to make sure they don't take it."</TE>
<TE>   Age has nothing to do with it. Ability and experience are
everything.</TE>
<TE>   Chastain and Fawcett are 34; Foudy and Lilly are 31. Hamm, at 30,
is the baby of the group. Between them, the "famous five" have played
1,030 games for the U.S. since 1987 and have won two world
championships, Olympic gold and silver medals, and countless other
titles and honors.</TE>
<TE>   But it is more than the clink of medals that keeps them competing.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always loved the game," Chastain said. "I've said a hundred
times before, when I go out onto the field I feel younger. I have my
best friends out there with me and we're all trying to challenge
ourselves to reach one ultimate goal, and that's to win the World
Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the five set out on that quest for the fourth time. The
eight-nation CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup that begins today at the Rose
Bowl is also the qualifying tournament for the fourth FIFA Women's
World Cup, to be played in China from Sept. 24 to Oct. 11, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. does not qualify automatically as defending champion. It
must earn its place, and that means getting past Mexico today,
Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday at Cal State Fullerton and Panama on
Saturday at Safeco Field in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   That will get the Americans to the semifinals, where another
victory in Seattle would clinch a place in the Gold Cup final at the
Rose Bowl on Nov. 9 and, more important, one of the three World Cup
berths allotted to the North and Central American and Caribbean
(CONCACAF) region.</TE>
<TE>   Coach April Heinrichs, a standout player on the U.S. team that won
the first world championship in China in 1991, relies on her veterans
but has selected a balanced 18-player roster that is deep.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mantra in selecting rosters is [to] pick the best 18, not the
18 best players," she said. "We want to pick the group that works
best together, bearing in mind tactical combinations, positional
combinations and systems of play.</TE>
<TE>   "Experience is the single most important quality that a player
has. You can't fake it. You can't wish it on a player. You can't will
it. When a player has it, she knows it, and when she plays as an
experienced player, you see a calmness and a composure and confidence
from that player.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that's most exciting about our roster is we have
experience and we have youthfulness. We have young professionals and
young pups and we have wise women who have been around, who have been
in every conceivable scenario in the game of soccer and have the
all-knowing belief that at the end of the day if they're on the field
they can help us win."</TE>
<TE>   The question remains, why stick around so long? Why not retire at
the top?</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard other athletes asked that," Chastain said. "Michael
Jordan, why do you continue to play? Jerry Rice, why do you continue
to play?</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's something that you love. It's a passion that you
have. It doesn't go away just because you win championships. Every
day is a challenge. Every year there's a different obstacle."</TE>
<TE>   And so today Chastain will step again onto the Rose Bowl turf, the
same turf where four years ago she experienced her defining moment as
an athlete when she fired that game-winning penalty kick past Chinese
goalkeeper Gao Hong to regain the Women's World Cup for the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Chastain's reaction became the photographic image of the
tournament, and indeed of women's sports in general, as she ripped
off her jersey and knelt on the grass, arms upraised in triumph.</TE>
<TE>   A year from now, she and the rest of the famous five hope to
provide another picture just like it.</TE>

<LD>Some memorable moments in World Series Game 6 history:</LD>
<LD>   1911 -- Danny Murphy of Philadelphia had four hits as the
Athletics beat the New York Giants, 13-2, to win the World Series in
six games. The A's put the game out of reach with a seven-run seventh
inning.</LD>
<LD>   1977 -- Reggie Jackson hit three consecutive home runs to lead the
New York Yankees to an 8-4 victory over the Dodgers and give them the
World Series title in six games. Jackson drove in five runs. All
three homers came on the first pitch.</LD>
<TE>   1985 -- Dane Iorg's two-run single and a disputed call by first
base umpire Don Denkinger in the ninth inning gave the Kansas City
Royals a 2-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals and tied the World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   1986 -- The New York Mets rallied for three runs with two outs in
the 10th inning against the Boston Red Sox and pushed the World
Series to a decisive seventh game. The tiebreaking run scored on
Boston first baseman Bill Buckner's error on Mookie Wilson's slow
grounder.</TE>
<TE>   1993 -- Joe Carter became the second player in baseball history to
end a World Series with a home run, hitting a three-run shot off
Mitch Williams in the ninth inning that gave the Toronto Blue Jays
their second consecutive championship with an 8-6 victory.</TE>

being Barry Bonds, he doesn't just assure you of a home run, he
assures you of a defensive blunder or two. Oh sure, it may not show
up in the scorebook as an error, but Barry plays for Barry. The bloop
double by Garret Anderson in the eighth inning of Game 6 gets caught
by 70% of major leaguers, but not Barry.</TE>

<HD>Kent's Free to 'Seek His Fortune Elsewhere,' Owner Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Giants are prepared to lose Jeff Kent, saying they
won't alter their budget to re-sign the All-Star second baseman.</LD>
<LD>   However, there's one team in particular the Giants hope Kent
doesn't join.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd hate to see him in a Dodger uniform," owner Peter Magowan
said. "I don't think he'd look very good in a Dodger uniform, from my
perspective. Of course, they might have a very different
perspective."</LD>
<TE>   Magowan said he has "heard about all kind of places where Jeff
would help a ballclub," but won't engage in a bidding war for Kent,
who is coming off his sixth consecutive season with at least 100 runs
batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea what the demand for him might turn out to be in an
industry that lost $800 million this year," said Magowan, also facing
the possible departures of General Manager Brian Sabean and Manager
Dusty Baker. "I believe there are going to be some adjustments next
year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's up to Jeff. If he wants to seek his fortune elsewhere, it's
a free country. There's not much we can do about it if he doesn't
want to be here. These are things we have to find out pretty soon."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At a lunch meeting in early May, Barry Bonds told agent Scott
Boras he had overhauled his batting approach to hit for a higher
average this season.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the type of news Boras expected after Bonds
established a record with 73 home runs in 2001, but Bonds figured he
would be pitched around even more and wanted to maximize his run
production.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I'm going to go up the middle and go to left field
more,' " Boras recalled, saying Bonds thought the opposition wouldn't
expect that.</TE>
<TE>   Despite breaking the record for walks he set in 2001, Bonds led
the majors with a .370 batting average and hit 46 homers with 110
RBIs and 117 runs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't shake my head and say, 'How did he do that?' Baker said.
"You do find yourself saying, 'Man, he's done it again.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Giants calculated an additional profit of $3 million if the
World Series went four games and $9 million if the maximum were
played.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a difference in there of $6 million," Magowan said, "and
that will affect [the 2003 payroll]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda could hardly be described as a
fan favorite in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps he should be.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Baker play for Lasorda, but, says Lasorda, he
converted Giant reliever Felix Rodriguez into a pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Signed as a free-agent catcher by the Dodgers in 1989, Rodriguez
was converted to a pitcher in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   That spring, Rodriguez was with the Dodgers in Toronto for an
exhibition game when Lasorda sent word down to the bullpen that he
wanted Rodriguez to pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez refused at first.</TE>
<TE>   "I want you to pitch," Lasorda insisted. "You can do this."</TE>
<TE>   Pitch he did, that day and for the rest of that season with
Class-A Vero Beach. Rodriguez was 8-8 with a 3.75 earned-run average
in his first year on the mound.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the 1995 season he had reached the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez went on to pitch for the Cincinnati Reds and Arizona
Diamondbacks before being traded to the Giants in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   It all began that day in Toronto when, at Lasorda's insistence,
Rodriguez took off the catcher's gear for the last time.</TE>

<HD>It's a Giant Task They Face Today</HD>
<DH>Confidence in team's ability to come back in deciding game
is San Francisco clubhouse theme.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Giants have been a resilient bunch through many
twists and turns this championship season.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants especially enjoy recounting their accomplishments,
believing they can overcome any obstacle. And that's good, because
the Giants need one another more than ever now.</LD>
<LD>   They're pulling together for one last game in the World Series,
which the Angels forced Saturday night by rallying for a 6-5 victory
in Game 6 before a delirious crowd of 44,506 at Edison Field.</LD>
<TE>   Trailing, 5-0, in the seventh, the Angels overcame the largest
World Series deficit of a club facing elimination. They pounded the
usually rock-solid San Francisco bullpen after Russ Ortiz worked 6
1/3 strong innings, scoring three runs in the seventh and three more
in the eighth to force a decisive Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   Only six outs away from celebrating their first World Series title
since moving to San Francisco, the Giants saw their similarly
resilient opponents strike back again. One way or another, the wild
show ends tonight, and it's the Giants' turn to try to rebound with
the baseball's biggest prize still up for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   Although the mood in the clubhouse was somber, the Giants
continued to preach their theme.</TE>
<TE>   "You always hope those types of things don't happen, but we're the
Giants and we can deal with it," second baseman Jeff Kent said. "Even
up, 5-0, we still knew we needed to close the ballgame. We knew it
wasn't [over] by any means. We put four of our best pitchers out
there; they scored six runs in the last two innings and won.</TE>
<TE>   "Five runs wasn't a sizable lead that we knew we could hold, and
we proved it because we couldn't hold it. We're just going to deal
with it and go on. This is a team that's resilient. This is a veteran
ballclub that doesn't get emotionally attached to losses. There's
nothing to bounce back from. This is what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Well, not exactly.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants held off the Dodgers for the National League wild-card
berth, outlasted the Atlanta Braves in the division series and
completed an improbable pennant run against the St. Louis Cardinals,
deftly handling ongoing speculation about the futures of General
Manager Brian Sabean and Manager Dusty Baker along the way. But the
Giants acknowledged the Angels are unlike any challenge they've
experienced.</TE>
<TE>   It's like looking into a mirror.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been an amazing series because both teams never give up,"
said Ortiz, showing his bounce-back ability after working only 1 2/3
innings in Game 2. "It's been back and forth, and the Angels are
doing an amazing job of hitting the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's disappointing when you lose a game like this, but
if you start to think negative thoughts you're going to hang your
head. We don't do that."</TE>
<TE>   The Giant bullpen was second to the Atlanta Braves in the NL, so
these guys aren't accustomed to squandering late-inning leads. Of
course, they Angels aren't cooperating with their plan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of rare that we would all struggle at the same time,"
said setup man Tim Worrell (1-1), who gave up three hits and three
runs in one-third of an inning.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get where we are without confidence, and we thought we
could shut the door on them tonight."</TE>
<TE>   But the Giants didn't, providing another opportunity for them to
close the season on a resilient note.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll go on and play Game 7, and it'll be a heck of a game for a
lot of people," Kent said. "We're going to just do what we do. If we
needed to do something different, we would have done it a long time
ago."</TE>

<HD>Now Starring on Fox: The Giants' Brat Pack</HD>

<LD>The World Series came down to this Saturday: Angel fans relying on
the rally monkey -- Anaheim falling behind as planned, of course, or
he's not needed -- and Giant fans figuring their team was a cinch to
win with the Rally Brat and His Day-Care Friends in the dugout.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't get any more exciting than this, unless Fox could have
wangled a way to lock a live monkey in a phone booth with the Giant
manager's unruly kid, put a camera on them and let's see who tears
whom apart. Maybe call it "Survivor." I have a hunch that kind of TV
show might draw an audience.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   FOX, OF course, is at its best when it gets one of these
compelling silly story lines it can beat into the ground, because the
game of baseball isn't enough to keep everyone's attention. Last week
we learned about monkey etiquette; tonight we began with a picture to
grip the heart of parents/viewers everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Well, we got 22 overkill shots to be exact of 3-year-old Darren
Baker, the little rug rat who was almost trampled to death the other
night while trying to retrieve a bat with a bunch of Giants circling
the bases. That's 22 shots Saturday night before getting our first
look at Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Fox opened its pregame show calling the Giant manager's son the
"lucky charm," noting the Giants are 8-0 in postseason play with the
Rally Brat in the dugout, and if I'm Giant pinch-hitter Ramon
Martinez, I'm worried the little twerp might get voted a full Series
share before me.</TE>
<TE>   Two out in the top of the first, and we had seen the Rally Brat 25
times, which meant the rally monkey had a lot of catching up to do.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DOWN ON the field during warm-ups, diehard Giant fan Robin
Williams was joking with Bobby Bonds, Barry's father, and the subject
of his comedy routine was the Rally Brat, and what would have
happened had he been run over instead of saved by J.T. Snow?</TE>
<TE>   "What was that, a child? Better take that kid off my cleats,"
Williams said, while acting like a baseball player trying to knock
dirt off his spikes with a bat.</TE>
<TE>   I had a feeling Fox would not ask Williams to do his routine on
camera.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOX, KNOWN for its hard-nosed reporting, told us the Giants had a
batboy coach currently charged with the duty of letting the Rally
Brat know the proper time to run on the field. Ramon Martinez now was
in danger of being overlooked by both a 3-year-old and the kid's
baby-sitter.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know why they just couldn't have used one of those leashes
on the twerp like parents use when dragging a kid through the mall.</TE>
<TE>   But you can imagine the great picture that would make, and as
Dusty Baker told us in Saturday's Times, "[Darren] told me he's tired
of being in the paper himself." And some people are worried
newspapers don't attract young readers.</TE>
<TE>   Now in the interest of fair play, Fox did a pregame feature on the
rally monkey, perched on the rocks in center field and jumping up and
down with a guitar in his hand before taking the instrument and
smashing it over the rocks -- oh, I'm sorry, I'm told that was Scott
Spiezio -- I guess I was a little too far from the TV to really tell
the difference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE GAME dragged in the early innings, and Fox showed a commercial
for one of its TV shows, "Bernie Mac," with Bernie meeting a woman
holding a baby in her arms. I think it was the Rally Brat. If not, a
week from now it will be.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth inning Shawon Dunston homered for the Giants, and now
the Rally Brat had company, with 10-year-old Shawon Dunston Jr.
threatening to become Fox's new little darling. Dunston's father
kissed his kid when he arrived at home plate, and by the end of the
inning we had seen the Rally Brat 29 times on the night and Dunston's
kid eight times, but closing fast.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels tried countering with their own youngster, Francisco
Rodriguez, but he's grown up a lot in the last few weeks, and just
isn't as cute anymore.</TE>
<TE>   In the sixth it appeared that it was going to be children's day at
the zoo with Bonds homering, kissing his kid at home plate and then
Fox giving us three shots of Bonds' daughter in the stands.</TE>
<TE>   I turned to senior assistant sports editor Randy Harvey, and I
could tell by the look in his eyes he thought I was going to try and
kiss him too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW THE Angel players have never really taken to the rally monkey,
and to be honest actually hate him because he gets more credit than
they do, and is certainly more adorable than any one of them. I can
only imagine how much it must gall them to have to take home a
stuffed monkey to appease their own kids.</TE>
<TE>   Without the monkey, though, the Angels don't win.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the rally monkey became a little impatient with the inept
Angels, showing up in the sixth inning and not getting much done. The
Giants had a 5-0 advantage, but with Fox going to the monkey-cam and
finding fans who believe in the power of the critter, the game
changed.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh the rally monkey hit a three-run homer ... I'm
sorry, that was Spiezio, but I know what it made the score: Rally
Brat 32, Dunston's kid 14, Bonds' son 5, Bonds' daughter 3, rally
monkey 13, Jackie Autry holding the rally monkey 2, the Giants 5, and
the Angels 3.</TE>
<TE>   The game turned permanently in favor of the Angels in the eighth,
and we were no longer getting pictures of the Giants' day-care
program, leaving a national TV audience to wonder just how the Rally
Brat took it after the rally monkey kicked his butt.</TE>

<LD>Jim Abbott, one of the most popular players in Angel history, is
scheduled to throw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 7
tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Abbott, who inspired youngsters by achieving his dream of pitching
in the major leagues despite being born without a right hand, jumped
directly from the U.S. Olympic team in 1988 to the major leagues with
the Angels in 1989. He pitched a no-hitter for the New York Yankees
in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   CATCH OF THE DAY: Rod Carew threw out the ceremonial first pitch
before Game 6 Saturday. Every Angel fan knows Carew, the Hall of Fame
infielder who played in Anaheim from 1979-85 and later served as the
Angels' batting instructor.</LD>
<TE>   Kevin Uhlich caught the ceremonial first pitch. Not every Angel
fan knows Uhlich, who began his Angel career as a batboy in 1976 and
rose through the organization to become the team's senior vice
president of business operations.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim Mead wanted me to catch the first pitch, and I told him I
don't deserve to," Uhlich said, referring to the team's vice
president of communications. "He said, 'Yes you do. You started as a
batboy. This is for all the guys who have come and gone in the front
office.' I said, 'Twist my arm.' That was fun."</TE>
<TE>   LOW NOTE: After arriving late for Game 5, the fighter pilots
apparently decided to take no chances Saturday, arriving early.</TE>
<TE>   During the middle of singer Brian McKnight's rendition of the
national anthem, the four jets roared overhead, drowning him out.</TE>
<TE>   Last week at Pacific Bell Park, the jets arrived several minutes
after the anthem, stunning a crowd that had returned to its seats.</TE>
<TE>   JUICED UP: Actor Robin Williams apparently isn't impressed with
the fake rock formation in center at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like a miniature-golf course on steroids," he said.</TE>
<TE>   HOME SECURITY: There weren't many who blocked the plate as
fearlessly and effectively as Mike Scioscia, the former Dodger
catcher and current Angel manager, but that feistiness sometimes came
at a price.</TE>
<TE>   Asked before Game 6 to recall his most memorable collision,
Scioscia said it was when Chili Davis, then with the Giants, barreled
into him in 1986 and knocked him unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   "I got hit harder by him than anyone else," Scioscia said. "Chili
plays hard. He's 6 feet 3, looks like Apollo Creed. I saw stars. That
was the hardest I've been hit, including all my years of playing
football. It was a heck of a collision."</TE>
<TE>   Did Davis score?</TE>
<TE>   "No, he was out that time," Scioscia said. "We were both out."</TE>
<TE>   SATISFACTION: Scioscia and Dusty Baker have both been players on
World Series-winning teams and now both are trying to manage teams to
a World Series championship.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the playoffs, Scioscia said he felt much more emotional
as a Dodger player than he does as an Angel manager.</TE>
<TE>   Before Game 6 Saturday, Baker said he had the opposite feeling.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably get more satisfaction as a manager," Baker said,
"because you're in charge, you're responsible for everything even if
you have nothing to do with some of it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was different as a player. It was more fun as a player because
you get to play and you get to have a direct effect on the outcome of
the game. Whereas, the manager, you still are at the mercy of how the
players perform."</TE>
<TE>   Just goes to show that it takes all kinds. Scioscia has tried to
stay as far in the background as possible. He even sighed a little
Saturday when asked to describe himself as a player, saying "I hope
this is the last time I ever have to talk about this."</TE>
<TE>   Baker is happy to talk about himself as a player, happy to share
remembrances. Each approach has earned each man respect and
admiration in their respective clubhouses, though.</TE>
<TE>   TEAM OF THE FUTURE: That's what Giant Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda
thinks of the Angels, who play baseball his way.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a great team that they have there," said Cepeda, the 1958
National League rookie of the year with the Giants. "You have kids
that are putting it together. They're sort of unknown ballplayers and
hungry, but I think people will get to know them now. I like that
ballclub."</TE>
<TE>   NO CONFIDENCE: Channel 11 didn't think much of the Angels' chances
in Game 6.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday afternoon, the Web site for the local Fox affiliate
didn't have Game 7 on its schedule for today.</TE>
<TE>   However, its prime-time schedule did have the Bruce Willis movie
"Die Hard," which could be the title of the Angels' highlight video.</TE>

<LD>Angel starter Kevin Appier was not happy when Manager Mike Scioscia
came to the mound to pull him in the fifth inning of Saturday night's
game, and he was furious by the time he reached the dugout, sending a
bucket of bubble gum and several bottles of water flying off the top
of the bench.</LD>
<LD>   After four shutout innings, Appier gave up a two-run homer to
Shawon Dunston and Kenny Lofton's double in the fifth, and he was
pulled in favor of Francisco Rodriguez.</LD>
<LD>   "I wasn't as mad about coming out as I was about the
circumstances, that giving up some runs caused me to be taken out,"
said Appier, who met privately with Scioscia after the game. "If we
didn't come back and win, I would have beaten myself up all winter."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That ringing in your ears in Edison Field isn't only from those
noise sticks; it's the sound cash registers all over the park have
been making for almost a month.</TE>
<TE>   Angel fans have been scooping up playoff and World Series
merchandise as quick as stadium employees unload it from boxes, and
there have been lines from the team store out to the stadium parking
lot every day of the World Series and on many off days.</TE>
<TE>   According to Kevin Uhlich, the Angels' senior vice president of
business operations, the Angels have grossed about $1 million in
merchandise sales on game days and about $100,000 on non-game days.
For a regular-season sellout, the Angels won't even gross $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are staggering numbers," Uhlich said. "Having something
with Angels and World Series on it is a collectible, because it's our
first World Series in 42 years. These are Super Bowl-like numbers."</TE>
<TE>   After production costs and fees paid to merchandisers, the Angels
will net about 25% of the gross merchandise sales. With revenues from
ticket sales, concessions and parking, the Angels will net between $6
million and $7 million on the entire playoffs, Uhlich said. That will
help offset projected losses of $18 million this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Business-wise, this is a lot better than ending the season in
September," Uhlich said. "It doesn't get you into the black, but it's
well worth it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels considered so many options for arranging a Game 7
pitching staff, Scioscia said, that the coaching staff even joked
about activating pitching coach Bud Black, who retired in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got 6 1/2 years' rest," Black said, smiling. "I can get six
outs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel catchers Bengie and Jose Molina send love and
congratulations to their father, Benjamin, who will be inducted into
the Puerto Rican baseball hall of fame today. The elder Molina did
not play professionally, but he holds the all-time hit record in the
Puerto Rican amateur league.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A rally to honor the Angels, win or lose, will take place Tuesday
in the Edison Field parking lot. The rally cannot take place inside
the ballpark for two reasons -- one, the Angels hope to attract more
fans than the seating capacity of 45,050, and two, equipment will be
unloaded onto the field Tuesday in preparation for Saturday's Rolling
Stones concert.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Batboys were still being discussed Saturday. Darren Baker, the
3-year-old son of Giant Manager Dusty Baker, was rescued from a
possible home-plate collision by J.T. Snow, in an incident that
received national attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Dusty, the enviroment he wants to set," said Mike
Scioscia, the Angel manager. "I didn't see the incident. I didn't
even see any replays of it. It's tough for me to comment on.</TE>
<TE>   "I just know that Dusty, they have a lot of kids around there,
they seem to respond to that kind of atmosphere."</TE>

<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   GIANTS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- Kenny Lofton popped to short.
Aurilia flied to center. Darren Baker is at the game. Jeff Kent lined
a single to center that almost took Kevin Appier's head off. Bonds
was walked intentionally. Santiago fouled to short. No runs, one hit,
two left.</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- For all of you having World Series
parties at home, Fox apologizes for putting the Bud Light "Bug guts
in teeth" commercial on so early. That ad is the reason you have so
much onion dip left over today. David Eckstein flied to left. Darin
Erstad grounded to second. Tim McCarver's scouting report on Russ
Ortiz says "Dances Through Raindrops." Which isn't helpful if you're
a baseball fan, but is the title of the next Kevin Costner movie. Tim
Salmon grounded to third. No runs, no hits.</LD>
<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- J.T. Snow flied to center. It takes
home plate umpire Tim McClelland about five minutes to give a strike
call. Reggie Sanders struck out swinging. David Bell struck out. No
runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- They just showed the John Hancock
commercial with the scheming wife who is encouraging her husband to
buy more life insurance. Garret Anderson flied to deep center. Ortiz
came inside with a pitch and knocked Troy Glaus down. That is the
second time the Giants have done that to Glaus in two games. The
Angels should take note and do the same thing to Bonds. Glaus walked.
Brad Fullmer hit a broken-bat pop fly to short. Fullmer hit Santiago
on the glove hand with his backswing. Scott Spiezio flied to center.
No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- Shawon Dunston flied to right.
Lofton tried to bunt for a hit, but Glaus charged in and threw him
out. Glaus made a tough play look easy. Aurilia walked. Kent popped
to short. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- Dusty Baker was interviewed and
basically laughed about the whole incident with his son in Game 5.
It's always funny when your kid escapes serious injury. "Excuse me,
Mr. Baker? We've found another baby-sitter for Friday, thanks
though." Bengie Molina flied to right. Adam Kennedy struck out
swinging. Fox asked Eckstein how tall he really is. It was a short
interview. Eckstein grounded to short. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- Bonds walked. Santiago grounded into
a 5-4-3 double play. Snow grounded to second. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- Erstad grounded to second. Salmon
hit a grounder into the hole at short, Aurilia bounced his throw to
first and Snow was unable to come up with it. There goes the
no-hitter. Anderson grounded into a 4-6-3 double play. No runs, one
hit, none left.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 3, Angels 0 -- You can't rip the Fox "FanCam"
today, because they played a Bruce Springsteen song with it. Kudos to
Fox. Sanders popped to short. Bell got an infield hit to short.
Dunston homered to left. There are a lot of Giant fans in attendance
at Edison Field. Lofton doubled to right-center. Francisco Rodriguez
pitching. Appier was none too pleased about Scioscia's taking him
out, saying words you really shouldn't say with Darren Baker in
attendance. He threw some stuff in the dugout too. So it appears the
Giants aren't the only ones with children in their dugout. Lofton
stole third. With the infield in, Aurilia grounded to short. Eckstein
was about 50 feet from first and still threw it with an arc. Moments
after McCarver told everyone how valuable Molina is, he lazily tried
to backhand a pitch in the dirt and it got by him for a wild pitch.
Lofton scored. Three runs, three hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 3, Angels 0 -- Glaus flied to the center-field
fence. Fullmer flied to right. Spiezio grounded to first, pitcher
covering. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 4, Angels 0 -- Barry Bonds homered to right. You
can hear people turning the channel all across America. It took Bonds
37 minutes to circle the bases. It's obvious why there are so many
kids in the Giant dugout. People dislike the Giants so much, they
can't even find someone to watch their kids. Snow singled to left.
Sanders struck out. Bell fouled to first. One run, two hits, one
left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 4, Angels 0 -- Molina flied to right. Kennedy
singled to center. Eckstein grounded to short, Kennedy to second.
Erstad walked. Salmon took strike three. How do you take strike three
in that situation? No runs, one hit, two left.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 5, Angels 0 -- Dunston popped to second. Lofton
singled to right. Lofton stole second on a pitchout. Molina's throw
bounced into center, so Lofton continued to third. Aurilia struck out
looking. Kent singled to center, Lofton scoring. It appears that the
hitters have caught up to Rodriguez, something for the Angels to keep
in mind next season. Bonds struck out swinging. One run, two hits,
one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 5, Angels 3 -- Anderson grounded to second. Glaus
singled to left. Fullmer singled to right, Glaus to second. Felix
Rodriguez pitching. After fouling off several two-strike pitches,
Spiezio homered to right. A great, great at-bat by Spiezio, who has
been the MVP for the Angels all postseason. Orlando Palmeiro, batting
for Molina, struck out. Scott Eyre pitching. The star of "John Doe"
is at the game. It must be just coincidence that his show airs on
Fox. Kennedy singled to left. Tim Worrell pitching. Eckstein flied to
right. Three runs, four hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 5, Angels 3 -- Brendan Donnelly pitching. Jose
Molina catching. Santiago walked. Snow flied to center. Sanders
struck out. Bell struck out. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 6, Giants 5 -- Erstad homered to right. Salmon
singled to center. Rally monkey! Rally monkey! Chone Figgins ran for
Salmon. Anderson singled to left, Bonds kicked the ball, allowing
Figgins to take third and Anderson second. Robb Nen pitching. Glaus
doubled to left, Figgins and Anderson scored. The crowd is going
crazy! After just missing a double by inches, Fullmer struck out
swinging. Spiezio was walked intentionally. Jose Molina sacrificed.
Kennedy struck out. Three runs, four hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 6, Giants 5 -- Troy Percival pitching. Alex Ochoa
to right. Dunston checks out. Tom Goodwin, batting for Dunston,
struck out swinging. That's the Tom Goodwin Dodger fans remember.
Lofton fouled to third. Aurilia struck out swinging. No runs, no
hits.</TE>

<HD>Winning Hit by Glaus Has Giants Flailing in the Dirt</HD>
<DH>Angel third baseman responds to knockdown pitches with an
eighth-inning double that ties the Series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After Troy Glaus burned San Francisco for two home runs in Game 1 of
the World Series and a two-run homer in Game 4, the Giants decided to
take a different tack toward the Angel third baseman.</LD>
<LD>   It was an old-school baseball approach, right out of the Sal "The
Barber" Maglie book on pitching, in which the hurler introduces the
back of a power hitter's jersey to the dirt around home plate.</LD>
<LD>   In Game 5 Thursday night, Giant right-hander Jason Schmidt threw a
high-and-tight fastball that put Glaus on his back, and in the second
inning of Game 6 Saturday night, San Francisco right-hander Russ
Ortiz cranked up the chin music, sending Glaus to the ground with
another high-and-tight fastball.</LD>
<TE>   "You could see it in his eyes, he was ticked off," Angel batting
instructor Mickey Hatcher said of Glaus, who struck out in three of
four at-bats Thursday night. "But sometimes you don't want to get a
guy mad when he's not swinging the bat that well. He's a cowboy. He's
a redneck. Nothing's gonna scare him."</TE>
<TE>   That was apparent later in the game Saturday night, when two key
hits by Glaus flattened the Giants and helped lead the Angels to a
pulsating, 6-5, come-from-behind victory, evening the series at three
games apiece and forcing a Game 7 tonight.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the seventh and the Angels trailing, 5-0, Glaus
singled to left off Ortiz. Brad Fullmer singled, and Scott Spiezio
smacked a three-run homer to right field off Felix Rodriguez, which
trimmed the lead to 5-3.</TE>
<TE>   Darin Erstad homered to lead off the eighth, and after singles by
Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson and an error put runners on second and
third, Glaus doubled to left-center off Giant closer Robb Nen,
scoring the tying and winning runs, only the fifth time a team has
rallied from a five-run deficit to win a World Series game.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, I was basically looking to hit a ground ball, try
to score one run, tie the game, give ourselves a little more life,"
Glaus said. "Fortunately, he left a slider up. I was able to get it
over the outfielders. I was going for a sacrifice fly, a grounder to
second, whatever. I didn't really care."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus is batting .417 (10 for 24) with three home runs and eight
runs batted in during the World Series and .356 (21 for 59) with
seven homers and 13 RBIs in the postseason, so whatever intimidation
tactics opponents have tried, they haven't worked. It was the same
way during the regular season, when Glaus hit .250 with 30 homers and
111 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been getting knocked down a lot," Angel bench coach Joe
Maddon said. "They want to get him off the plate so he gives up the
outside edge. Some think they can intimidate him, but I've never seen
him intimidated. Troy is tougher than people think, and he keeps
proving it to people who think they can do things like that to him."</TE>
<TE>   In the top of the eighth inning, Angel reliever Brendan Donnelly
twice sent Giant catcher Benito Santiago to his back with
high-and-tight fastballs, and Santiago glared at Donnelly as he took
first on a walk.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if it was important to send a message to his hitters after
Glaus was knocked down twice in two games, Donnelly stared ahead and
said, "Next question." But Donnelly's response didn't go unnoticed in
the clubhouse, where some Angels said privately that they were pumped
up by his response.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy is mentally strong, he doesn't let that stuff affect him,"
Erstad said. "As a power hitter, he has to understand that's part of
the game. He keeps his composure well."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad, though, is another story. Leading off the eighth, the
center fielder lined a fat 1-1 Tim Worrell changeup into the
right-field seats to cut the Angels' deficit to 5-4, and the word
"composure" wouldn't be used to describe his reaction when he got
back to the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   "That charged up the entire bench," Maddon said. "He was so pumped
up, and so was everyone else. At that moment, we knew we were going
to win that game. You could feel it. I don't know why, you just feel
that you are."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon singled to center, Anderson blooped a single to left, Glaus
smacked his double, and the Angels mixed a nice seven-and-seven, with
the Giants on the rocks: it was come-from-behind win No. 7 for the
Angels in the playoffs and it forced a Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been dreaming about Game 7 of the World Series since I was 4
years old," Erstad said. "This is it, the ultimate, what you do in
your backyard."</TE>

<LD>ANGELS' JOHN LACKEY (1-0, 2.60 ERA in playoffs)</LD>
<LD>   vs. GIANTS' LIVAN HERNANDEZ (1-1, 4.91 ERA in playoffs)</LD>
<LD>   Edison Field, 5 P.M.</LD>
<TE>   TV -- Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KLAC (570), XPRS (1090), KSPN (1110).</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Lackey, picked over Ramon Ortiz to start Game 7, will
start on three days' rest for the first time this season. In his two
playoff starts, Lackey pitched seven shutout innings in the league
championship series and four shutout innings in his Game 4 start in
the World Series, before giving up three runs in the fifth in an
inning started by a single chopped in front of the plate and a bunt
single that hugged the third base line. Although Kirk Rueter stymied
the Angels in Game 4, the Giants will bypass him in favor of
Hernandez, whom the Angels routed for six runs in 3 2/3 innings in
Game 3. Hernandez, with a 6-1 lifetime playoff record, lost 16 games
during the regular season.</TE>

<LD>Moments after looking foolish on a pitch he swung at and missed by
about a foot, Troy Glaus doubled up the left-center alley to score
Chone Figgins and Garret Anderson and give the Angels a 6-5 lead in
the eighth. The hit was made more impressive when you consider it
came off Giant closer Robb Nen.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   NOT IN BOX SCORE</LD>
<TE>   Scott Spiezio's three-run home run at-bat was a clinic in hitting.
After falling behind, 1-and-2, and facing the 97-mph fastball of
Felix Rodriguez, Spiezio fouled off two pitches and took two close
pitches for balls before lofting a full-count pitch into the seats in
right field. It might have been one of the toughest three-run homers
in some time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE BIG LETDOWN</TE>
<TE>   When Kenny Lofton stole second and took third on Bengie Molina's
throwing error, then scored on Jeff Kent's two-out single in the
seventh, it appeared the Angel season was over, especially with Felix
Rodriguez, Tim Worrell and Robb Nen in the wings. The Angel crowd was
as quiet as it has been all postseason.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DID YOU NOTICE?</TE>
<TE>   The folks at Fox pretty much gave the World Series to the Giants
in the seventh inning. They started showing shots of Giant fans in
the stands and replayed Barry Bonds' big home runs from the
postseason. They even discussed who would win Series MVP. They didn't
know the Angels had one more comeback left in them.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Remains Critics' Choice</HD>
<DH>Despite major talent, a "major attitude" and aloofness make
him hard to embrace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Hiserman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The best hitter in baseball will find out today whether he'll be
getting that ring he's been wanting. It's his best chance yet to
silence any remaining critics. You know, the ones who would ignore
the 613 career regular season home runs and the four -- soon to be
five -- Most Valuable Player awards and instead seem to focus on
those 17 years he's spent chasing an elusive World Series title.</LD>
<LD>   It's the same old story, the same old question: What has he won?
Bonds has led teams to the playoffs six times, and just this year
enjoyed winning a series for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   If Hollywood were writing this script -- well, perhaps not a
Disney studio -- it might have Bonds smack a game-winning home run
today in Game 7. But if many baseball fans have their way, he might
be the goat.</LD>
<TE>   For the first eight days of this Series, Bonds has starred with
his athletic skills on baseball's biggest stage, showing even the
game's most casual fans what all the fuss has been about. He's hit
prodigious home runs -- four in all, including matching 485-foot
shots through weighted night air in Games 2 and 6 that left even
Angel players slack-jawed in their dugout -- and reached base at a
dizzying pace. All while also fully living up to another well-earned
reputation -- for being unemotional, dour and cocky.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine, he wasn't in a good mood after Saturday night's 6-5 loss
to the Anaheim Angels. So, while Tim Worrell, who was shelled in
one-third of an inning of relief, patiently answered questions a few
feet away, Bonds chased reporters from around his and Kenny Lofton's
locker, quickly dressed, and headed for the door without offering a
word. Therefore, we might never know what happened to cause Garret
Anderson's eighth inning single to twice squirt from his bare hand,
allowing Anderson to hustle into second base after the error. Or
whether, with a better jump, he might have caught the laser Troy
Glaus then hit over his head, scoring Anderson with the go-head run.</TE>
<TE>   Both were key plays, especially because Anderson, who has had a
tight hamstring, might not have scored from first on Glaus' hit. Of
course, there was also the mammoth home run to talk about, the one he
hit off Angel phenom Francisco Rodriguez leading off the sixth
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, as has his reputation throughout his career, rolled with
the coaster Saturday night. The good with the bad. That's the paradox
that is Bonds. He is a wonderful talent and nearly universally
accepted as the best ballplayer of his era. Yet, he is, in an age of
instant celebrity, an anti-celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters have written that he is "arrogant," "rude," and a
"poster boy for the modern, spoiled athlete." Didn't you see him
stroll, so self-centeredly, directly to his place on the baseline
during pregame introductions before the first Series game in San
Francisco? Didn't the rest of the Giant players slap hands and
exchange words of encouragement with each of their teammates and
coaches?</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, it seems, goes his own way a lot. He doesn't eat with the
team -- he has his own nutritionist and diet -- and doesn't stretch
with the team -- he has his own routine for that, too. His place in
the Giants' clubhouse at Pacific Bell Park is more than twice the
size of his teammates', none of whom has a leather recliner at their
cubicle.</TE>
<TE>   And so a Bonds' victory today, for many, would lack sentiment.
Watching him embrace his son, Nikolai, and plant a kiss on him after
his home run on Saturday somehow wasn't quite the same as seeing John
Elway cradle football's Super Bowl trophy or Ray Bourque hoist
hockey's Stanley Cup in moments of glory enjoyed at the ends of their
storied careers. In terms of pure ability, Bonds is to baseball what
Michael Jordan was to basketball and Wayne Gretzky to hockey. He's
just not nearly as beloved.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan and Gretzky were global ambassadors for their sports,
reveling in their extraordinary talents. Bonds isn't much of an
ambassador at all. He has few endorsements and enjoys limited
popularity outside the environs of the Bay Area. Part of that can be
traced to Bonds' relationship with the media. It is strained, at
best. Athletes haven't always cozied up to reporters -- Jordan, for
example, has been known to cop a major attitude -- but few can kill
an interview session with such an icy stare.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's why the players in Bonds' company on baseball's
career home run list all have nicknames -- Henry Aaron was "Hammerin'
Hank," Babe Ruth the "Sultan of Swat," and Willie Mays the "Say Hey
Kid," but sportswriters have penned no such poetic or musical
tributes for Bonds. Sorry, the occasional and snide "Mr. Personality"
doesn't count.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Mark McGwire's prodigious home runs and Sammy
Sosa's playful nature captivated a nation as they chased Roger Maris'
record for home runs hit in a season. Last year, when Bonds reached a
milestone by hitting the 500th homer of his career, teammates stayed
in the dugout as he crossed the plate. Later, as he went on to slug
73 homers, surpassing the 70 McGwire hit in 1998, many fans remained
apathetic.</TE>
<TE>   McGwire's record-setting home run was recently voted fourth among
baseball's most memorable moments. Bonds' feat of re-establishing
that record wasn't even in the top 10. No surprise there. The list
was the result of an Internet fan poll. Bonds doesn't win many
popularity contests.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is that little about him exudes warmth or friendliness
with even his occasional acts of kindness toward fans. When he
catches the final out of the inning, he'll flip the ball over his
shoulder into the stands as he jogs toward the dugout -- but he won't
make eye contact with any of those people in the seats. Another
reason may be that Bonds chooses to keep private his good deeds.</TE>
<TE>   Giant broadcaster Jon Miller tells of meeting a woman at PacBell
Park who was there to take in a ballgame in celebration of her
"100-and-something" birthday. She was there, she told Miller, by the
kindness of Bonds, who also routinely brightened her day by visiting
her.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't recall hearing about a press conference about it," Miller
said of Bonds' generosity, "or seeing anything in the newspaper."
Friends say there is, indeed, a soft side to Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if the public took the time to get to know him, they
would know that Barry is a very caring person, a sensitive person,"
said Atlanta Brave outfielder Gary Sheffield, one of Bonds' closest
friends in baseball. "Barry does things for people, we're talking
about major things, major money, major time. He does things for his
heart. He doesn't care what people think." Not that it was always
that way. Bonds just discovered he couldn't please everyone -- and
quit trying. "If he would have been different to accommodate people,
they're still not going to like you anyway," Sheffield said. "Half
the people are going to like you and half not."</TE>
<TE>   Worrying about it would only be a distraction.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for me to come in here and just talk," Bonds said
before a gathering of reporters earlier this week. "I want to do my
talking on the field. That's where it counts. That's where it
matters."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who was born in Riverside on July 24, 1964, owes his
ball-playing skills to a combination of nature and nurture. He
carries major-league chromosomes from his father, Bobby, who spent
half of his 14-year career with the Giants and hit 332 home runs. And
he was reared in an environment that allowed him to shag fly balls
before games and run around in the Giants' clubhouse. The great Mays
is his godfather. Baseball seemed to come easy to Bonds, who had a
.467 batting average his senior year at Serra High in San Mateo,
played three years at Arizona State before he was selected by the
Pittsburgh Pirates with the sixth pick in the 1985 draft, and was in
the big leagues a year later.</TE>
<TE>   Playing for the Giants, with whom he's played since 1993, allowed
him spend more time with his father, who worked as the team's hitting
coach from 1993-96 and now serves as a special assistant for player
personnel. "I share everything with my father," Bonds said. "Not just
baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was also able to reunite with a high school friend, Liz
Watson, whom he married in 1998 after a nasty divorce from his first
wife that required six years of court proceedings to determine a
financial settlement. He has a son, Nikolai, and daughter from his
first marriage and a daughter with Watson. Daughters Shikari and
Aisha Lynn watch from the stands, sometimes holding signs imploring
opponents to pitch to their daddy.</TE>
<TE>   Those signs are often ignored. Having set the single-season home
run record last season, Bonds this season established a record with
198 walks during the regular season. (Teammate Shawon Dunston, by
contrast, has walked 203 times in his 18-year career). Many games, he
saw only three or four strikes yet he led the majors with a .370
batting average and also hit 46 home runs with 110 runs batted in. He
reached base by hit, walk or being hit by pitch almost six out of
every 10 times he stepped into the batter's box, a previously
unimaginable feat.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said the best strategy against Bonds is
"cross your fingers and hope he doesn't get a chance to bat where he
can hurt you."</TE>
<TE>   In the World Series, Angel Manager Mike Scioscia is having a hard
time determining when that might be. When might a solo home run might
be the game-winning home run. Already down 3-0 on Saturday, the Angel
manager had Rodriguez challenge Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, it was 4-0. Bonds' threat is constant. But no matter
what he does critics are hesitant to give him his full due. They
point out that he looks more like a football linebacker these days
than the skinny leadoff hitter he was when he entered the big
leagues. The sudden weight gain and the increase in his home run
production so late in his career have prompted many to speculate that
he is using steroids. Bonds says he uses creatine, which is a legal
dietary supplement, but denies using steroids.</TE>
<TE>   One undeniable knock on his career -- until this season -- was his
history of postseason failure. Before these playoffs he had a career
postseason batting average of .196 with one home run. This
postseason, he is batting .357 with eight home runs, 16 RBIs and a
record 26 walks.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield said he used to brag to Bonds about the World Series
ring he won in 1997 with the Florida Marlins. "I used to tease him,
but then I saw how serious it really became," Sheffield said. "I saw
how deep it was in him that he wanted to win." But Bonds insists that
he does not need a championship ring to complete his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't ever hear them downgrade Ted Williams when they talk
about how good a player he was," Sheffield said, evoking the man many
considered to be the game's best hitter. "He never won." After today,
we'll know if the same must be said of Bonds.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Right-hander Dean Chance was an Angel for the team's first six
seasons, then pitched five more seasons with the Twins, Indians, Mets
and Tigers. His finest year was 1964 when, at 23, he won the Cy Young
Award by going 20-9 with a 1.65 ERA, 11 shutouts and 15 complete
games. He was also a 20-game winner with Minnesota in 1967. His
career record was 128-115. Chance, now a boxing promoter, is guest
analyst for The Times for this World Series.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Oh, man alive, was this tremendous or what? I guess if you are a
Giant fan, you didn't like it, but if you are a baseball fan, you
would have to love a game like this.</LD>
<TE>   It all came down to three key pitches.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1, there was Scott Spiezio against Felix Rodriguez in the
seventh inning. What a quality at-bat that was. Spiezio worked him
for eight pitches, the eighth being the three-run homer that got the
Angels back in the game. Now if Rodriguez keeps that ball high,
Spiezio can't get a bat on it because he's a low-ball hitter. If
Rodriguez had gotten it up and in on the fists, Spiezio might have
been in trouble. But Spiezio kept fouling pitches away until
Rodriguez got it in his wheelhouse, got it down where Spiezio could
get the full extension, came inside with the slider knee-high. And
Spiezio golfed it out.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2, you've got Darin Erstad against Tim Worrell to lead off the
eighth. Here the Angels caught a break because I thought the Giants
were going to bring in Robb Nen to start the inning.</TE>
<TE>   I was just hoping Erstad would get on base. I never dreamed of a
home run. From the way he swung, it looked like he hit a changeup.</TE>
<TE>   And No. 3, you've got Troy Glaus against Nen in the eighth. Here
was another big break. Nen had that slider working away against
Glaus, he made him look bad on it, but he didn't stay with it. I'll
tell you, if I'm pitching, I stay with nothing but sliders on the
outside. Or, if I go with a fastball, I make sure I get it inside
enough where he can't hit it. So what does Nen do? He throws a
terrible pitch, a high fastball that Nen didn't get in enough.</TE>
<TE>   As far as Angel pitching, that Percival was really something in
the ninth inning. What's impressive was that, not only was he
throwing 99 miles an hour, but the location he gets is tremendous.
I'm talking about height and inside and outside. Everything.</TE>
<TE>   As for tonight, if I'm Angel Manager Mike Scioscia, I just play it
inning by inning. He's going to start John Lackey. Fine, but I would
make Jarrod Washburn my second pitcher, use him three innings if I
had too, then the Kid, Francisco Rodriguez, and then Percival.</TE>
<TE>   But before we focus on tonight, I want to savor Saturday night a
little longer.</TE>
<TE>   I guarantee you, anybody who ever wore the Angel uniform felt like
they were out there last night.</TE>

<HD>Angels Will Go With Rookie</HD>
<DH>Lackey opens tonight, trying to become the first rookie
starter to win a Series Game 7 in 93 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin and Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So it comes down to the kid who had never pitched in the big leagues
until the end of June against the postseason veteran who was
threatening to snatch the title of Mr. October away from Reggie
Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia will give the ball to John Lackey to
start tonight's seventh game of the World Series. San Francisco Giant
Manager Dusty Baker will counter with right-hander Livan Hernandez.</LD>
<LD>   Lackey will be attempting to become the first rookie in 93 years
to win Game 7 of a World Series. "I've been thinking about playing in
the seventh game of the World Series since I was a kid," he said.
"Now I get a chance to actually do it."</LD>
<TE>   Lackey was dreaming of just pitching in the big leagues until June
30 when he was called up from triple-A Salt Lake City to start the
second game of a doubleheader against the Texas Rangers at Arlington.
Lackey replaced a struggling Scott Schoeneweis, who was sent to the
bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey lost that night, giving up three runs seven innings in a
game the Angels lost 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   But he won the admiration of Scioscia and pitching coach Bud Black
for his poise and command.</TE>
<TE>   So even though the 23-year-old native of Abilene, Texas, was sent
back to Salt Lake immediately after the game, it was only a temporary
demotion. He wound up the regular season going 9-4 with a 3.66 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   He lost once in his final seven starts of the regular season. He
won the game that clinched the Angels' first playoff berth in 16
years, stopping a four-game losing streak in the process.</TE>
<TE>   In his first playoff start, he threw seven shutout innings in the
league championship series. In Game 4 of the World Series, he pitched
four shutout innings, then gave up three runs in a fifth inning that
started with a chop single and a bunt single.</TE>
<TE>   So while the Angels partially chose Lackey over Ramon Ortiz to
start tonight's game because of the wrist tendinitis hampering Ortiz,
that is not the main reason. Lackey simply won the assignment, the
last and best one of an amazing rookie season.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't ask for a better man to be out there than Lackey,"
closer Troy Percival said. "He's not scared of anything."</TE>
<TE>   Lackey becomes the first rookie to start a Game 7 since Jaret
Wright, who grew up in Anaheim and whose father, Clyde, pitched for
the Angels. In Game 7 of the 1997 World Series, pitching for the
Cleveland Indians, Wright took a 2-0 lead into the seventh inning.
The Indians lost, 3-2, in 11 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey is believed to be the eighth rookie to start Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   No rookie has won Game 7 since Babe Adams did so for the 1909
Pittsburgh Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz, who will be available in relief today, acknowledged that "I
might not be 100%" and said he supported the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Lackey's feeling good," Ortiz said. "I'm happy. I want to win. I
don't mind. It's not my decision."</TE>
<TE>   As for Hernandez, he was 6-0 in the postseason until he ran into
the Angel hitting machine in Game 3 of this World Series, getting
bombed for six runs, five earned, in three and two-thirds innings.</TE>
<TE>   While Baker is starting the Cuban native, he's hardly telling the
rest of his rotation to take the night off.</TE>
<TE>   "We fell comfortable with Livan," Baker said, "but we're going to
go with everybody. You know, [Jason] Schmidt can be available, Kirk
Rueter can be available. All the guys in our bullpen can be
available."</TE>
<TE>   Tired arms? Pitch counts? In a seventh game, adrenaline counts
most of all.</TE>

<HD>Baker Doesn't Feel so Lucky After This Letdown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A tape is playing softly in the visiting manager's office at Edison
Field. It is a Dusty Baker favorite: John Lee Hooker from his album,
"Mr. Lucky."</LD>
<LD>   Mr. Lucky?</LD>
<LD>   "Dammit," says Baker.</LD>
<TE>   He says it no louder than the tape, but he repeats it as he works
at his desk, writing a lineup for Game 7 of the World Series on a
yellow pad, wishing it wasn't necessary, having done everything he
thought was necessary to close out the Angels in Game 6, uncork the
champagne, unplug the rally monkey.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we were thinking, that was the plan," Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, they had something to say about it."</TE>
<TE>   He meant the Angels, and what they had to say translated into the
biggest comeback ever for a team facing World Series elimination.</TE>
<TE>   What they had to say translated into a thunderous rally from a
5-0, seventh-inning deficit for a 6-5 victory over the San Francisco
Giants as Baker called on his bullpen four times in the seventh and
eighth innings in a futile attempt to stop the Angels where they were
and avoid the uncertainty of a Game 7 in which he will bring back
Livan Hernandez, who is 6-1 in the postseason but led the National
League in losses and was ripped by the Angels in Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Angels will be starting rookie John Lackey on three
days rest, and Baker made note of that as he was asked if this Game 6
loss was one of the biggest hurts his Giants had ever suffered.</TE>
<TE>   "In a long time," he said, "but this is the most resilient team
I've ever been around. It always comes back from a tough loss, but
dammit."</TE>
<TE>   Three runs in the seventh and three in the eighth lifted the
Angels to their most improbable victory in a season of improbable
victories, and nothing Baker did could stop it, no one he called on
had the answer.</TE>
<TE>   Especially not Felix Rodriguez, Tim Worrell or Robbie Nen, the big
three of his bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know who's been more dependable," Baker said, "but the
Angels were on their last breath, trying to get to tomorrow, and I've
always said it's tough to take the last breath out of a team. Now,
we're both on our last breath."</TE>
<TE>   The way it happened was that Russ Ortiz, bombed by the Angels in
Game 2, came back to give Baker six shutout innings, working out of a
threat in the sixth before he allowed singles to Troy Glaus and Brad
Fullmer with one out in the seventh -- only the Angels' third and
fourth hits -- and was replaced by right-hander Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   "We were an inning ahead of ourselves with the bullpen," Baker
acknowledged, "but Russ had done his job. We were hoping to get him
through the seventh, but they had started to hit him in the sixth and
I didn't think we could go any farther when they got those two hits
in the seventh."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez had a 3-and-2 count on Scott Spiezio, the first batter
he faced, when Spiezio ignited the crowd and put the Angels back in
the game with a three-run homer that landed in the first row of the
field-level seats in right.</TE>
<TE>   "The first row?" Baker said later. "Dammit."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez struck out pinch-hitter Orlando Palmeiro for the second
out, but Baker applied a quick hook. He brought in left-hander Scott
Eyre to face Adam Kennedy, only to have Kennedy single, prompting
Baker to return to his bullpen for right-hander Worrell, who ended
the inning by getting David Eckstein on a fly to right.</TE>
<TE>   It was 5-3 as Worrell returned for the eighth and was greeted by a
Darin Erstad home run and singles by Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson.
When Barry Bonds bobbled the Anderson hit in left, the Angels had
runners at second and third, no outs and Glaus at the plate, and
Baker was on his way to the mound again to bring in closer Nen, who
would need six outs to finish this one successfully.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't get close.</TE>
<TE>   The count was 2 and 1 when Nen delivered a 91-mph fastball that
had too much of the plate, and Glaus ripped it into left center to
score the runs that tied and won the game, stunned the Giants and
left Baker's 3-year-old son, the celebrated bat boy Darren, in tears.</TE>
<TE>   "A lesson in life," his dad would say.</TE>
<TE>   A lesson that was second-guessed in any way?</TE>
<TE>   Not in the Giants clubhouse, where Jeff Kent said of Baker's
relief moves: "We've been doing the same thing just about every game
we've played in the postseason. This is not the regular season. In
the playoffs, you don't give guys days off. You do everything you can
to win every game."</TE>
<TE>   Worrell agreed. He said fatigue wasn't a factor in the bullpen's
failure.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't remember anyone going through our bullpen like the Angels
did tonight," he said. "We've gone from Felix to me to Robbie
two-thirds of the season. There have been times I've put Robbie in
worse situations than that with no outs and he's gotten out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Not this time, not with those noise sticks pounding, the rally
monkey jumping off the scoreboard and the Angels visualizing all
those other times they've come back this season.</TE>
<TE>   Can the Giants? Can their bullpen?</TE>
<TE>   No problem, Baker kept saying as "Mr. Lucky" played in the
background, and the manager paused to reflect on an amazing game and
wondered if it would ultimately be categorized as a classic that
would be replayed again and again on that TV network that features
classics.</TE>
<TE>   Did he realize it was one as it was happening.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize it now," he said. "At the time I said, '--- that
classic.' "</TE>

<HD>Spiezio's Clutch At-Bat Rescues Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Great accomplishments start small.</LD>
<LD>   They start with ball one. A little outside and Scott Spiezio
watches. He fouls off the second pitch from Giant reliever Felix
Rodriguez and the third. So the count is 1-and-2.</LD>
<LD>   It is the bottom of the seventh and the Angels are running on the
fumes of Giants, they are running behind 5-0 in an elimination game
in the World Series, they seem to be running slower and slower.</LD>
<TE>   There is one out but Troy Glaus and Brad Fullmer each have
singled, hard-fought, patient hits, not from the swings of desperate
men but from the minds of confident men, men certain some offense can
be created, some last gasp can be breathed.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio fouls off a third consecutive pitch and the count is still
1-and-2. Palms are sweaty in the Angels' dugout and the Giants' too.
Spiezio is determined, a hitting bulldog with all the knowledge he
has gained from his father, Ed.</TE>
<TE>   When Scott was 5, Ed, a former major league player, had Scott
doing situational hitting. "Son, pretend it is Game 7 of the World
Series, bottom of the ninth, your team is down, guys on base, you at
bat." The 5-year-old took it all in.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard, though, to imagine this particular situation -- a
1-and-2 count in Game 6 of the World Series when your team is on the
go-home-as-runners-up end of the 3-2 standings.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad tried to put me in the toughest situation so that any
other situation didn't seem as tough," Spiezio says later, when his
eyes are still unfocused and his mind is still trying to understand
what he has done. "My dad always seemed to use Game 7. So I guess
I'll be able to use that tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there will be a tomorrow because of what Spiezio did with
this singular at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   With his finely trained eye and no nerves that showed, Spiezio
took ball two. Then another foul. Then he took again, ball three and
everybody in Edison Field is standing now. Everybody in the stands,
in the dugouts.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez is breathing hard and shaking his pitching arm, trying
to loosen it maybe or trying to find something extra, strength, pop,
oomph.</TE>
<TE>   On the next pitch, the 3-and-2 pitch, with Glaus and Fullmer
crouched and eager to move, Spiezio swings and the ball goes high in
the air. It is heading deep into the night, toward the fence in right
field.</TE>
<TE>   But hard enough? It doesn't seem to be. "I knew he got a good
portion of it," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia says. "I didn't know if
it was too high. I thought it was going to be close."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd inhales and there is not the frantic noise that had
accompanied a Glaus deep fly in the top of the fifth, when he had
pushed the ball to the very edges of the park, had seemed to have
clobbered a home run. But it was only a long out, the start of
another 1-2-3 inning by the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   This, though, is different. It is located perfectly, it travels
just far enough. Right fielder Reggie Sanders seems nonchalant about
the ball, too, wandering slowly toward it, as if he was either sure
he could catch it or sure he'd have no chance.</TE>
<TE>   When the ball lands, it is in the second row, in the corner and it
is a three-run home run.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio doesn't know at first if he's done just enough or not
quite enough with the ball. "I said, 'God, please let it get over the
fence.' "</TE>
<TE>   Don't think this is luck or a one-shot wonder.</TE>
<TE>   "He's having an MVP year," Angel hitting coach Mickey Hatcher says
in the jubilant Angel clubhouse. "He's the MVP of our team. He's been
picking us up offensively and defensively all year and you can see
the confidence Scott has when he steps into the box."</TE>
<TE>   While Barry Bonds and all his pyrotechnics have mesmerized World
Series watchers, while Glaus' power has brought Giant pitchers to the
point of knocking him down two games in a row, it is Spiezio, the
quiet first baseman with the red streaks painted into his goatee, who
has 19 runs batted in, tying Cleveland's Sandy Alomar in 1997 for
most in a postseason.</TE>
<TE>   This home run makes the score 5-3 but it does much more. It
crystallizes again what the Angels are about, that they are about
always, always believing in themselves and always, always doing the
right things.</TE>
<TE>   "That home run was huge," Scioscia says.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get something like that, it will give you a lift."</TE>
<TE>   As Glaus says, "Coming back from five runs is difficult. Coming
back from two is a little bit more viable of a situation. Now we can
play the game like we wanted to. We can steal bases, hit-and-run,
bunt, do things like that."</TE>
<TE>   This home run is the start of the biggest comeback ever by a team
facing elimination in the World Series and it is hit by a man who too
many teams too many times tried to eliminate. Including his own.</TE>
<TE>   At spring training before the 2001 season, the Angels were
bringing in guys like Wally Joyner, who had thought he was retired,
to knock Spiezio out of the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   And now, after the biggest hit of his life, in the biggest game of
his life, Spiezio is humble and awed by the occasion and also
thinking ahead already.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy did a great job, starting the inning off, getting on.
Fullmer, with another base hit behind him," Spiezio says, refusing to
accept his hero-hood. "You can't drive in any runs without guys on in
front of you. They did a great job. And with some points on the
board, that gave the guys something to shoot for."</TE>
<TE>   After his home run, Spiezio sits in the dugout, his eyes closed,
his head bowed. He is thinking, he says, of the feeling he had at the
plate, trying to remember what he did right and imprinting that
memory for a future at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   And he is considering already that he will be up again in the
game. "I was," Spiezio says, "getting myself prepared for the next
at-bat."</TE>
<TE>   Amazing.</TE>
<TE>   That is all to be said about Spiezio. About this game. About the
Angels, no matter what happens today.</TE>

<LD>This was baseball at its most dramatic.</LD>
<LD>   This was Game 6 of the World Series, top of the ninth inning, two
out, Troy Percival trying to close out a 6-5 Angel victory against
Rich Aurilia.</LD>
<LD>   This is how Fox covered it:</LD>
<TE>   Camera shot of Aurilia fiddling with his batting glove.</TE>
<TE>   Crowd shot of Jackie Autry looking quite nervous.</TE>
<TE>   Shot of Aurilia staring and digging in against Percival.</TE>
<TE>   Facial shot of Percival looking quite determined.</TE>
<TE>   Dugout shot of Barry Bonds looking quite concerned.</TE>
<TE>   Crowd shot of an Angel fan looking quite nervous.</TE>
<TE>   (Percival delivers. High. Ball one.)</TE>
<TE>   Shot of Aurilia spitting and tugging at his jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Dugout shot of Dusty Baker chewing on a toothpick.</TE>
<TE>   Quick shot of Jeff Kent swinging a weighted bat in the on-deck
circle.</TE>
<TE>   Another dugout shot of Bonds, still looking quite concerned.</TE>
<TE>   (Percival delivers. On the outside corner. One and one.)</TE>
<TE>   Replay of Percival delivering on the outside corner.</TE>
<TE>   Panoramic shot of Edison Field. The fans seem excited.</TE>
<TE>   Closeup of Aurilia's face. He looks very serious.</TE>
<TE>   (Percival delivers. Low and outside. Two and one.)</TE>
<TE>   Closeup of Percival pulling off his cap, then putting it back on.</TE>
<TE>   Closeup of Aurilia watching him do this.</TE>
<TE>   Quick shot of Kent, who's still in the on-deck circle.</TE>
<TE>   Facial shot of Percival. Lots of stubble. Needs a shave.</TE>
<TE>   Facial shot of Aurilia. Goatee is neatly trimmed.</TE>
<TE>   Dugout shot of J.T. Snow, looking quite concerned, chin buried in
arms crossed on top of the railing.</TE>
<TE>   Dugout shot of Russ Ortiz wondering how in the world the Giant
bullpen could blow a 5-0 seventh-inning lead.</TE>
<TE>   (Percival delivers. Aurilia fouls it back. Two and two.)</TE>
<TE>   Closeup of Aurilia spitting.</TE>
<TE>   Closeup of Percival trudging back to the mound.</TE>
<TE>   One more dugout shot of Bonds, now very, very concerned.</TE>
<TE>   Dugout level view of fans behind the Angel dugout. They appear to
be cheering.</TE>
<TE>   Another shot of Autry. She's clapping now.</TE>
<TE>   Closeup of Percival tugging on the bill of his cap. His fingers
are apparently very dirty.</TE>
<TE>   Dugout shot of Mike Scioscia squeezing his nose. Are his ears
burning from Tim McCarver's criticism of his decision to have Jose
Molina bunt with runners on first and second and one out in the
bottom of the eighth? Can't tell from this angle. Where are Fox's
cameras when you really need them?</TE>
<TE>   Shot of Aurilia digging in and grimacing.</TE>
<TE>   (Percival delivers. Aurilia swings and misses.)</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see you tomorrow night!" Joe Buck exclaims.</TE>
<TE>   Good thing for the Angels Percival was on the mound, where he
couldn't see any of this.</TE>
<TE>   He never would have made it through that last at-bat without
Dramamine.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of Angel fans have been complaining about the way Fox has
been covering this World Series, but you have to say this about the
camera work: It's perfect for a team owned by the people who own
Disneyland. There's a very technical term for camera style Fox uses
at baseball games. The professionals call it "MatterhornVision."</TE>
<TE>   The camera whips around here, pulls a hairpin curve there. It's
white-knuckle time, all the time, even though all they're doing out
there is playing catch.</TE>
<TE>   Amid this visual bobsled run, Buck knew well enough to pull back.
Someone had to. Buck's call of Troy Glaus' game-winning two-run
double was a refreshing piece of minimalism:</TE>
<TE>   "It's two and one to Glaus ... Into left center field! ... Bonds
on the run! Won't get it! ... And the Anaheim Angels have come all
the way back and lead it, 6 to 5!"</TE>
<TE>   And after Percival clinched the victory with his strikeout of
Aurilia, Buck went silent and let the crowd's reaction supply the
narration. It's was Fox's best moment of this World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, the silence eventually had to end and soon Buck was
uttering the words that strike fear in the heart of every baseball
fan: "Steve Lyons is standing by with Troy Glaus."</TE>
<TE>   Lyons is master of the question-free quickie postgame interview,
tossing general statements into the air and hoping the interviewee
agrees with them. After two such exchanges with Glaus, Lyons suddenly
threw a changeup:</TE>
<TE>   "During this postseason, the entire country has been introduced to
these crowds, the rally monkey and everything that goes with it. Does
that make you guys feel like you're never out of a game, even when
you're down 5-0 in the seventh?"</TE>
<TE>   How about that? The Angels appear to be peaking at just the right
time. Maybe Lyons too.</TE>

<DH>Wrigley Field's friendly confines in L.A. gave the Angels
of another era a chance to reign as Pacific Coast League's best</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire and David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The memories are sweet and plentiful, just like the perfectly plump
oranges that used to dangle from the trees blanketing Los Angeles in
the days when the only baseball circuit that mattered was the Pacific
Coast League, and the team of choice was the L.A. Angels. For those
who remember it best, the opportunity to pick a favorite story is too
juicy to resist.</LD>
<LD>   "Today, Los Angeles is like Mars, but it was so far different
then," said John Schulian, a television writer and former
sportswriter raised in the city and its since-demolished ballparks --
the Angels' Wrigley Field and the Hollywood Stars' Gilmore Field. "It
used to be like a small town, with the orange groves, a streetcar
system that worked, and a real nice section that was Hollywood. My
mother didn't drive. She went everywhere in town on buses. Can you
imagine that?"</LD>
<LD>   So much from that period does seem unfathomable now, especially
this notion that minor league baseball could so effectively grip the
attention of a market that was growing so large, sophisticated and
major league.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to remember," said veteran broadcaster Stu Nahan, "these
were the days before coaxial cable."</TE>
<TE>   Those were also the days before the Dodgers' 1958 arrival and the
1961 major league debut of Gene Autry's expansion Angels. Certainly,
football was king in the city -- with the Rams, USC and UCLA -- but
for more than 30 years there were no more important baseball games in
the Western United States than those being played at Wrigley, located
in South Central Los Angeles on the corner of 42nd Place and Avalon
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels debuted when the Pacific Coast League started in 1903,
led by a 41-year-old deaf mute center fielder named William "Dummy"
Hoy who stole 48 bases and scored a league-best 157 runs. Baseball
legend has it that umpires first used signs for balls and strikes
because of Hoy. The franchise won five league titles before being
purchased for $125,000 by chewing gum magnate and Chicago Cub owner
William K. Wrigley Jr. in 1921. The Angels relocated from a downtown
park in 1925 to 20,500-seat Wrigley Field, a $1.3-million ballpark
designed to look like Chicago's famed field -- with some notable
exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The exterior was California-style -- red-roofed with a white
facade. The power alleys were a hitter's dream -- 345 feet. There was
a 15-foot high wall in left field with no seating. A 12-story office
tower was placed at the entrance. And, in 1931, lights were
installed.</TE>
<TE>   "A beautiful park, a monstrous hitter's park," said Dick Beverage,
president of the Pacific Coast League Historical Society. "The
problem with it was the plot of land it was on. The fences couldn't
[connect] in a semicircle. Across the street there [beyond left
field] was a bunch of houses. The balls just rained on this one house
in the power alley. The window on the top story would be broken, and
there were dents on the boards."</TE>
<TE>   Wrigley's brightest star was center fielder Jigger Statz, who
spent a record 18 minor league seasons with the Angels. Statz carved
the palm out of his glove to get a better feel for the ball and
roamed the outfield so effectively that when someone once asked
native Californian and Brooklyn Dodger Duke Snider who was the best
center fielder he ever saw, he bypassed fellow New Yorkers Mickey
Mantle and Willie Mays to note Statz.</TE>
<TE>   Statz, making $10,000 a year, was on the 1934 Angel team that the
National Assn. of Professional Baseball named the best minor league
team of all time. League most valuable player Frank Demaree won the
triple crown, batting .383 with 45 home runs and 173 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Most impressive, the 1934 Angels were so dominant (137-50 in the
regular season) that the league made them play a collection of
all-stars from other teams in the league championship series. The
Angels won the series and finished the 1930s with three titles and
more than 1,000 wins. Lou "The Mad Russian" Novikoff became another
triple crown winner in 1940, hitting .343 with 41 homers and 171 RBIs
while his wife, Esther, occasionally verbally abused him from the
seats.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd strike out and she'd curse him," Beverage said. "[Fans] were
closer to the players. You could hear the players. The players could
relate to the fans. There was a lot of what they called bench
jockeying. The guys on the bench would yell at opposing players. All
the players knew each other's weaknesses. That's why the memories are
so pleasant. You could really see that the players were people."</TE>
<TE>   Beverage dismissed the rumor that dogged Novikoff during his
playing days. He was such a terrible outfielder it was said he
suffered from an incurable fear of vines, a devastating phobia given
that Wrigley's left-field wall was covered with ivy. The theory
gained momentum because Novikoff would let balls sail over his head
and carom off the wall. He later said the problem was a crooked
left-field line.</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, Negro League stars Lou Dials, an outfielder, and Chet
Brewer, a pitcher, were offered a tryout by Angel President Clarence
"Pants" Rowland, but owner Phil Wrigley refused to sign them. In
other areas, the PCL made considerable progress in the 1940s.
Attendance was rivaling that in some major league cities. The
nation's depth of talented players overflowed from the 16 major
league teams into the eight-team PCL.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these fellas were a step slower, threw the ball a little
slower and couldn't hit as well as the big leaguers, but, still, this
was very good baseball," Bill Weiss, a longtime PCL statistician,
said.</TE>
<TE>   Players loved the league because the pay often exceeded major
league salaries, the travel to cities such as Seattle, San Francisco
and San Diego was enjoyable, and trips to each city lasted from
Tuesday through Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was civilized living," former Angel pitcher Ralph Mauriello
said. "You were able to enjoy your family at home and hang up your
shirts and unpack your bags on the road."</TE>
<TE>   In 1945, Rowland, then the PCL president, petitioned for his
league to be designated a third major league. The cause never won
enough support, but the league was declassified from triple A
standing for the 1952 season and allowed to restrict players from
being called to the major leagues. The Angels were a Cub affiliate.
Television coverage of games cut into the Angels' attendance in the
1950s, although the team boasted a future TV star on its roster in
1951, Chuck Connors of "The Rifleman."</TE>
<TE>   Most tragic for the team was Walter O'Malley's heightening
interest in moving his Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember talking to Mr. O'Malley about baseball in Los Angeles
during spring training in 1956," said Mauriello. "He was asking me if
L.A. was a good sports town. I told him it was a football town and
expressed doubt that a baseball team could make it. Maybe my opinion
was biased. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, and when I had come to
L.A., it just seemed that baseball wasn't that important, that all
the kids' heroes were football players."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, one homegrown Angeleno, Gene Mauch, knew that wasn't entirely
true. Mauch, who would later manage the California Angels to American
League West titles in 1982 and 1986, was a second baseman for the Los
Angeles Angels from 1954-56.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were the happiest three years of my playing life," Mauch
said. "I had played in the big leagues six to seven years before I
was an Angel, and no one in L.A. knew who in the hell I was. As soon
as I came to L.A., I made a lot of new friends."</TE>
<TE>   Friends, and enemies. Mauch recalls suppressing a chuckle when
opposing pitcher Chet Johnson would shake his knees for comic relief
before delivering a pitch to Mauch, who typically wore out
left-handers. Earning a robust $15,000, the future manager was
regarded as the league's smartest player, PCL statistician Weiss
said. Mauch proved it by remaining constantly alert. He knew, for
example, that when opposing base coach Jimmie Reese winked to a
baserunner, it meant a steal was coming. So Mauch repeatedly signed
for his catcher to call a pitchout whenever Reese winked, one-upping
the man he'd later work with in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mauch drew a line between gamesmanship and poor
sportsmanship. He didn't appreciate the behavior of Carlos Bernier,
the flamboyant member of the Angels' rival Hollywood Stars. Mauch
said Bernier stole bases even if his team was winning in a rout.
"That burned me up," Mauch said. "I wouldn't let anyone else on our
team tag him out."</TE>
<TE>   Mauch took it a step further, grabbing a handful of dirt when
Bernier reached first base so he could throw it into his eyes en
route to second. "We had a fierce, fierce rivalry with that team,"
Mauch said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a class thing," said Schulian. "The Stars' name
alone, plus their affluent location, exacerbated that idea."</TE>
<TE>   The Stars, a Pittsburgh Pirates affiliate, were owned by Bob Cobb,
president of the Brown Derby and the Cobb Salad inventor. Actor Gary
Cooper also owned a piece of the team.</TE>
<TE>   The rivalry heated up during the Angels-Stars bitter 1953 fight,
described by most reporters as a riot. It started between two
gentlemen, Angel pitcher Joe Hatten and Frank "Mousey" Kelleher, who
had six consecutive hits against the Angels. Hatten wouldn't accept a
seventh, hurling a pitch in Kelleher's back. Kelleher charged the
mound, igniting a 10-minute brawl.</TE>
<TE>   Seconds after order was restored, Star pinch-runner Teddy Beard
slid into Angel third baseman Murray Franklin "so high he would have
sailed into the seats if his spikes hadn't hit Franklin in the chest
first," said Nahan. The brawl that followed was so intense -- players
turned to boxing, umpires ducked punches -- that William Parker, Los
Angeles' chief of police, ordered a herd of police to Gilmore Field.
The police remained there for the next day's doubleheader. "They kept
all the players [who weren't playing] in the clubhouse," Angel right
fielder Max West said. "When a manager wanted a ballplayer, they told
the police and he went into the clubhouse to get the guy."</TE>
<TE>   The action didn't last much longer. In 1956, Angel first baseman
Steve Bilko, a former-day Mark McGwire in the midst of three
consecutive MVP seasons, won the triple crown with 55 homers, 164
RBIs and a .360 average. The Angels finished 107-61 and won their
final PCL championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve Bilko was a great athlete, very loose, with a great pair of
hands," Mauch said. "He loved to eat -- if you left icing on the
tablecloth, he'd eat it -- and he loved to drink beer. If he took
better care of himself, he would have been an outstanding major
league player. No one had a bad word to say about him ever. There was
none better."</TE>
<TE>   Bilko hit 56 homers for the Angels in their final season, 1957,
and was so valued by the team -- earning an estimated $17,500 -- that
he was forced to take a pay cut when he joined the Cincinnati Reds in
1958. His teammates on that final Angel team included pitcher Tom
Lasorda and second baseman Sparky Anderson. Bilko died of a heart
attack in 1978. The Times ran his obituary on the front page.</TE>
<TE>   The PCL Angels' obituary came in October 1957, eight months after
Phil Wrigley sold the team to O'Malley for $2.5 million and the
rights to the Dodgers' triple-A club in Fort Worth. O'Malley's
decision to move the Dodgers west resulted in the Angels' relocation
to Spokane, Wash., and the Stars' move to Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't mourn over it," Mauch said. "I thought the people of Los
Angeles deserved a major league team."</TE>
<TE>   The city added a second team when Autry's Angels became an
expansion team in 1961. The team played, appropriately, in Wrigley
Field in 1961. Bilko homered in the team's season-opening win against
Baltimore, and, fittingly, struck the final homer hit in Wrigley.</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, Wrigley Field was torn down to make room for a community
center.</TE>
<TE>   "I never felt like I was experiencing anything less than anyone
else in the country because I was living in a PCL town," Schulian
said. "I was mesmerized by these guys, and even today, I think about
how Bilko and guys like Casey Wise and Gale 'Windy' Wade would have
been in the big leagues today."</TE>

<LD>The baseball season was tired, worn out, ready for a long winter's
nap. Old Man Baseball had just about set his head on his pillow when
the Angels yanked the pillow aside, shook him out of his slumber and
yelled into his ear the most magical words in the sport:</LD>
<LD>   Game 7!</LD>
<LD>   In a glorious game that will be replayed and retold in Southern
California for generations to come, and in a comeback unprecedented
in World Series history, the Angels scored six runs in their final
two at-bats Saturday night in a stunning 6-5 victory over the San
Francisco Giants.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels, eight outs from elimination, forced a decisive seventh
game by roaring back from a 5-0 deficit with three runs in the
seventh inning and three more in the eighth. Scott Spiezio
resuscitated the Angels with a three-run homer in the seventh, Troy
Glaus delivered the game-winning double in the eighth, and the Angels
lived to play the game of the childhood dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we'll have the hero," Angel second baseman Adam
Kennedy said. "That's what we've all been dreaming about forever, the
chance to say we were a hero in Game 7."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, facing an elimination game for the first time this
October, made history in victory. Never before had a team trailed by
five runs in a World Series elimination game and come back to win.</TE>
<TE>   Of their 10 postseason victories, the Angels have come from behind
in seven. In Game 3 of the division series, they came back from five
runs down against the New York Yankees. In Game 2 of the World
Series, the previous most amazing game in franchise history, the
Angels blew a 5-0 lead and won 11-10.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," center fielder Darin Erstad said. "This is borderline
getting a little crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kennedy: "Pick any game in the whole playoffs, and
people have said this is the best game they've ever seen. Here's another
one. I hope we have one more in us."</TE>
<TE>   There was a sense that this one was something incredibly special,
one players and fans will share with their children and
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds hit a home run. The Giants' Shawon Dunston hit a home
run too, circled the bases, crossed the plate and kissed his batboy
son, 10-year-old Shawon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio, whose father Ed owns two World Series championship rings,
hit the home run that revived hope he could win one of his own.
Brendan Donnelly, who endured a decade in the minor leagues and
recurrent unemployment in the sport he loved, earned a victory in the
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   This is not about a monkey on the scoreboard. This is about a game
so remarkable that a sellout crowd of 44,506, which stood upon
Spiezio's home run and never again sat down or shut up, produced such
a joyful noise that Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said he could compare
it only to that most hallowed of Southern California baseball
moments, Kirk Gibson's pinch-hit home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World
Series at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "There was about as much electricity in that stadium as there ever
was," Scioscia said. "I think tonight surpassed that."</TE>
<TE>   The Angel offense, in overdrive throughout October, had suddenly
sputtered. San Francisco starter Russ Ortiz, routed for nine hits in
1 2/3 innings in Game 2, pitched a two-hit shutout through six
innings.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the Angels had failed to score in 19 of 21 innings.
When Garret Anderson grounded out to start the seventh, the Giants
were eight outs away from the World Series championship.</TE>
<TE>   But Glaus singled, and Brad Fullmer singled, and the Giants
promptly removed Ortiz, with a 5-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants summoned Felix Rodriguez, who has pitched in every game
of the Series and 13 of their 16 playoff games. Spiezio worked the
count full, and beyond, fouling off four pitches. On the eighth
pitch, Spiezio yanked a home run that just made it into the
right-field seats.</TE>
<TE>   "I was praying," he said. "I was just saying, 'God, please just
get over the fence.' "</TE>
<TE>   Just like that, Spiezio kept hope alive. But San Francisco still
led after seven innings, 5-3, six outs to a championship.</TE>
<TE>   As the Giants batted in the top of the eighth, Tim Salmon said he
stood in right field and thought, ever so briefly, about whether his
next at-bat "could be my last at-bat of the year."</TE>
<TE>   But Tim Worrell, working for the fifth time in the Series and the
12th time in 16 playoff games, could not stop the Angels in the
bottom of the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad led off the inning with a home run. Giants 5, Angels 4.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon singled and Chone Figgins ran for him. Anderson dropped a
single near the left-field line, Bonds bobbled it for an error, and
the Angels had the tying and winning runs on second and third. The
Giants turned to closer Robb Nen.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus turned on a 2-1 slider, ripping a double to left-center over
Bonds' head. Angels 6, Giants 5.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Troy Percival retired the side in order in the ninth,
leaving Jeff Kent stranded on deck, and punctuated the victory with a
fist pump.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in awe," coach Mickey Hatcher said. "I just love these guys."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had planned and prayed, not necessarily in that order,
that Kevin Appier could deliver five innings, with Francisco
Rodriguez and Percival sharing the final four.</TE>
<TE>   Appier pitched into the fifth inning, with a shutout intact.
Rodriguez, Donnelly and Percival took care of the final 4 2/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   And so today will be the final day of a spectacular season. The
World Series extended to seven games last year, with a Game 7 duel
that started with Curt Schilling and Roger Clemens and ended with
Randy Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Today, someone will become a hero forever.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so pumped up," Salmon said. "I want to play right now.
Somehow, we've got to go to sleep."</TE>

<LD>It is Bill Mazeroski hitting a home run in the Pirates' last at-bat
off the Yankees' Ralph Terry, the Cardinals' Enos Slaughter scurrying
on his mad dash from first to home on Harry Walker's single to beat
the Red Sox, Sandy Amoros making a spectacular catch against the
Yankees' Yogi Berra and doubling off the runner to save the Brooklyn
Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   It is the Yankees' Bobby Richardson nabbing a Willie McCovey line
drive to save a shutout for Terry, the Reds' Joe Morgan looping a
ninth-inning single over the Red Sox's Jim Burton to score Ken
Griffey, the Arizona Diamondbacks, in their last bat, improbably
getting to Yankee closer Mariano Rivera.</LD>
<LD>   It is Game 7 of the World Series. We will have one tonight in, of
all places, Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels, who in years gone by have been one game, one out, one
pitch from the World Series, are now one game from winning it. The
Giants, a proud franchise that won the World Series when based in New
York, are one game from winning it for the first time since they
moved to San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   It is a chance for the Giants' Barry Bonds to finally win it all.
It is a chance for Angel players such as Garret Anderson, Darin
Erstad, Tim Salmon, Troy Glaus and Troy Percival to fulfill the
promise that most of the nation outside of Southern California --
outside of Orange County, really -- didn't know they had.</TE>
<TE>   If past Game 7s are an indication, though, one of those players
will not be the hero tonight.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, a pinch-hitter, Gene Larkin, hit a bases-loaded single
off Atlanta's Alejandro Pena to give the Twins a 1-0 victory. At
least his mighty swipe reached the outfield. Four years earlier,
another Twin, Greg Gagne, won the game against St. Louis with a slow
roller down the third base line with the bases loaded. When the
Dodgers won Game 7 in 1965 behind a three-hitter by Sandy Koufax, the
hitting star was Sweet Lou Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Will the Giants win tonight with a home run by Bonds? Or by Shawon
Dunston, who for six innings Saturday night at Edison Field looked
like he might be the star with his two-run home run in the fifth?
Will the Angels win tonight with a double off the wall by Glaus? Or
because a pinch-runner like Chone Figgins, as he did Saturday night,
force Bonds into an error in left field?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The questions Saturday night for the Giants and Angels,
especially, the Angels, focused on who would pitch tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia was asked that before Game 6,
assuming, of course, his team would win to force a Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   "We've given it a ton of thought," he said, referring to himself
and pitching coach Bud Black. "I've got smoke coming from my ears.</TE>
<TE>   "Buddy Black, he's hoarse from talking to me.... We've worked this
thing every which way you can work it, even the scenario of Buddy
Black coming in to pitch a game."</TE>
<TE>   Giant Manager Dusty Baker said before Saturday night's game that
he would start Livan Hernandez if Game 7 were necessary. Several
hours later, after the devastating 6-5 loss in Game 6, Baker hadn't
changed his mind, but considering that Hernandez was hit often and
hard by the Angels on Wednesday night in their Game 3 victory at San
Francisco, the Giant manager has a contingency plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel comfortable with Livan," he said. "But tomorrow, we're
going to go with everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Then he added, "I'm curious to see who they're going to go with
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia didn't keep him waiting long for the answer, the smoke
apparently having cleared. He announced that he would start rookie
John Lackey.</TE>
<TE>   It is Ramon Ortiz's turn to start, but he has an injured wrist. It
would be wrong, however, to assume that he won't pitch at all.
Injured wrist or not, he will be in the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   So will Jarrod Washburn, the ace who didn't pitch like one when he
started in the Angels' 16-4 loss Thursday in Game 5. So will
Francisco Rodriguez, even though he threw 46 pitches Saturday night
in relief. Percival even might be called on to get more than four
outs. Scioscia's contingency is the same as Baker's. Everybody is
available, except Bud Black.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Considering the state of the pitching staffs, and considering the
hitting prowess of the teams, a reasonable prediction for tonight's
game would be that it will be high scoring. One would be advised to
bet the over.</TE>
<TE>   But even though it is a Game 7, the ultimate game, the game that
the television executives said they needed to wake up the rest of the
country to the fact that there is a big event occurring out here on
the Left Coast, there is no guarantee that it will come close to
challenging Game 6 for drama and excitement.</TE>
<TE>   Sixth games in the World Series are often more memorable than
seventh games. Carlton Fisk's famous home run was in a Game 6. Bill
Buckner's error was in a Game 6.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said this Game 6 was better than Game 1 in 1988, the one
won by Kirk Gibson's home run. For a former Dodger, one who played a
key role in that game, to say that, well, that's treading on sacred
territory. It's also a game that has sustained us in this part of the
baseball world for 14 years. If Saturday night's game can do that,
then maybe it doesn't matter if Game 7 is as exhilarating. But we can
hope.</TE>

<LD>Five to nothing. Five to nothing. Five to nothing.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels, after a long and earnest fight, expired early Saturday
evening while resting comfortably among friends.</LD>
<LD>   Trailing the San Francisco Giants by an exact handful of runs in
the seventh inning in their World Series knockout game, they lay
lifeless on the Edison Field grass while all around them mourned and
remembered.</LD>
<TE>   "They were such battlers."</TE>
<TE>   "They worked so hard."</TE>
<TE>   "We're so proud of ... "'</TE>
<TE>   Wait a minute.</TE>
<TE>   Through the pathos emerged a scruffy, stringy-haired character
named Scott Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   He parted the crowd, leaned over the body, put his hands on the
chest, and pushed.</TE>
<TE>   Three-run home run!</TE>
<TE>   Following him was a stubble-bearded guy with red socks up to his
waist named Darin Erstad.</TE>
<TE>   He leaned over, put his hands on the same body, and pushed again.</TE>
<TE>   Home run!</TE>
<TE>   The mourning ceased, hope filled the house with cheering and
pleading, then a third man stepped up, tobacco juice running down his
chin, name of Troy Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   He leaned over and, amid a roar that surely shook those hands,
nonetheless delivered a push whose impact will be felt here forever.</TE>
<TE>   Two-run double!</TE>
<TE>   And with a jerk and a shout it was alive, they were alive, all of
Orange County was alive, running and leaping and finally bounding
into each other's arms, revived and restored and blessed, these
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Six to five. Six to five. Six to five.</TE>
<TE>   Seven outs from a series-ending loss, the Angels stunned the
Giants Saturday with a 6-5 comeback victory that knotted the
Otherworldly Series at three wins apiece.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels gained Game 7. The Giants lost everything.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels now have their Kirk Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants now have their Donnie Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Said the Giants' Tim Worrell, standing in a morgue of a clubhouse:
"We felt like we had it locked up."</TE>
<TE>   Said the Angels' David Eckstein, bouncing in the loud one down the
hall: "I can't really put this into words. It was amazing."</TE>
<TE>   It was better than that.</TE>
<TE>   It was better than Sandy Koufax beating the Minnesota Twins in
Game 7 on two days' rest.</TE>
<TE>   Koufax had nine innings, the Angels had seven outs.</TE>
<TE>   It was better than the 1981 Dodgers sweeping the Yankees in four
consecutive games after losing the first two.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had six days, the Angels had about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, gasp, it was even better than Gibby.</TE>
<TE>   ."When Gibson hit his home run, we still had a bunch of games
left," said Mickey Hatcher, who was in the dugout watching Gibson's
Game One homer in 1988. "Tonight, we didn't have none."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, as on that Saturday 14 years ago, Hatcher was one of the
first ones out of the dugout as the game ended, running to embrace
Troy Percival in the feeling that this was something never
experienced around here before.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like magic back in 1988," said Hatcher, the Angel hitting
coach. "Tonight, you could feel that same magic."</TE>
<TE>   The largely Dodger-populated coaching staff has adamantly resisted
making such comparisons throughout this jaw-dropping postseason, but
Saturday they had no choice.</TE>
<TE>   This was, indeed, the greatest World Series game in Southland
history.</TE>
<TE>   And, if you believe the statistics, one of the greatest World
Series games ever, seeing as it was the biggest comeback during an
elimination game during the 98 years that the World Series has been
held.</TE>
<TE>   "Down to our last outs, if we lose we go home?" asked Erstad with
that wry grin. "Yeah, I'd say this was our best."</TE>
<TE>   Considering seven of their 10 postseason wins have featured
comebacks, that is saying something.</TE>
<TE>   And to think that the blast of a lifetime started with a foul
ball.</TE>
<TE>   Before Spiezio's seventh-inning homer, he fouled off four of seven
pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept telling myself that I was right on it, just keep looking
for a pitch to hit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants will long remember not Felix Rodriguez's home-run
pitch, but right fielder Reggie Sanders' confusion. The rainbow fly
ball was catchable, if Sanders had not gotten lost and run into the
wall before beginning his leap.</TE>
<TE>   The sound of the crowd was as long and loopy and memorable as the
home run itself, a low murmur breaking into a rising wail before
ending in a thundering roar.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was an out," said Hatcher. "Then it wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' eighth-inning rally will be remembered for that same
Spiezio resiliency, this time with Erstad homering on Tim Worrell's
hanging slider after collecting just one hit in his previous 12
at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the soft liner by Salmon, and a bloop by Garret
Anderson, and the wall-banging bomb by Glaus, and history.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't like all of them hit the ball real hard," said Worrell.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants can keep telling themselves that, but the hardest hits
in those final two innings were surely on their psyche.</TE>
<TE>   How can they recover from this?</TE>
<TE>   Their star, Barry Bonds, in chasing down two balls in that eighth
inning, looked like a klutz.</TE>
<TE>   Their manager, Dusty Baker, in bringing in three relievers in the
seventh, looked like a fool.</TE>
<TE>   Their bullpen is decimated. Their belief is in question.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody recovers from this, just ask the 1986 Angels.</TE>
<TE>   As the current version left the field Saturday night, one of the
giant scoreboards flashed a sign, again and again.</TE>
<TE>   "You Gotta Believe!"</TE>
<TE>   How can you not?</TE>
