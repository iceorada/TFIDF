<HD>How the Dream Unfolded</HD>
<DH>MARTIN LUTHER KING JR., By Marshall Frady, Viking/Lipper:
216 pp., $19.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID J. GARROW</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martin Luther King Jr. was a vastly different person than many people
realize. At no time during or before his civil rights leadership
career did King ever want to be any sort of public figure or
celebrity; King's emergence in the national and then international
limelight was wholly the result of others pushing him forward as a
symbolic African American leader and not of any egotistical desire or
self-promotion on King's own part.</LD>
<LD>   King's initial reluctance to become a "leader," coupled with a
lifelong ambivalence toward praise and honors, shaped a most
remarkable and commendable man. King not only never reveled in or
gloated over his press clippings and media celebrity but, as more and
more awards came his way, he became more self-critical and
self-demanding.</LD>
<LD>   The best source for appreciating King's deep humility is also the
most deliciously ironic: the hundreds and hundreds of King's
telephone conversations that J. Edgar Hoover's FBI secretly taped and
that have been publicly available for more than 15 years, thanks to
the federal Freedom of Information Act. The FBI's intent was to
damage King's reputation through evidence of either
communist-affiliated advisors or sexual indiscretions, but instead
the agency generated a documentary record that time and again attests
to King's selfless nobility.</LD>
<TE>   Among biographers and civil rights movement scholars, a virtual
consensus has marked understandings of King for more than a decade;
no major interpretative disagreements separate me from Taylor Branch,
or Clayborne Carson from James H. Cone. Indeed, the last truly
original book on King, Keith D. Miller's "Voice of Deliverance: The
Language of Martin Luther King Jr., and Its Sources," appeared in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   Against this backdrop, Marshall Frady's slim new contribution to
the Penguin Lives Series breaks no new ground but does a commendable
job of presenting an accurate and easily digestible account of King's
life in just a few more than 200 footnote-free pages. Frady met King
in 1964, when, as a neophyte reporter for Newsweek, he was sent to
cover a protest campaign King was heading up in the historic but
intensely segregated town of St. Augustine, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Frady describes King then as "a startlingly unprepossessing
figure--a short, chunky man, with a manner of unremitting and
ponderous gravity" such that he could well have been "a comfortably
prosperous funeral home director." King was chunkier and looked far
less youthful than he had been when the remarkable success of the
Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott of 1955-56 had catapulted the
27-year-old pastor to sudden fame. King had been selected as the
black community's spokesman in part because the women who had
launched the boycott were vulnerable to white retaliation in their
jobs as publicly paid teachers and because, as someone who had lived
in Montgomery for just over a year, King was not closely aligned with
any existing community factions.</TE>
<TE>   But King was far from thrilled about his selection, and almost two
months passed before he underwent a private spiritual experience in
the kitchen of his parsonage--the "kitchen experience," King scholars
often call it--that led him to accept that this was the role and
mission that God was calling upon him to undertake. Frady, like
others before him, refers repeatedly to this "kitchen experience" as
looming very large indeed in King's own understanding of himself, and
Frady's portrait of King's inner life is consistently on target.</TE>
<TE>   Frady's brief account is less copiously detailed on the public
events in which King was caught up from 1956 until his assassination
on April 4, 1968. Throughout those years, King found himself flying
hither and yon, from speech to sermon to courthouse protest march, at
a pace that Frady correctly describes as resembling "some sort of
interminable campaign tour." Frady's account does brief justice to
King's major protest campaigns, including Birmingham and Selma, as
well as to other heralded events, such as the 1963 march on
Washington, but a reader of Frady's book may not realize the extent
to which the breadth and depth of the civil rights movement,
especially in the Deep South, far exceeded King's own intense
peregrinations.</TE>
<TE>   Within civil rights history, the most important books of recent
years--titles such as Adam Fairclough's "Race &amp; Democracy: The Civil
Rights Struggle in Louisiana, 1915-1972" and Charles Payne's "I've
Got the Light of Freedom: The Organizing Tradition and the
Mississippi Freedom Struggle"--focus upon relatively unheralded
events and rarely receive review attention outside the scholarly
community. It may seem shocking that among scholars, King's star has
been in eclipse for more than a decade, but there is no gainsaying
that as more years go by, King's historical import will likely
continue to slowly shrink as scholars concentrate upon the movement's
grass roots rather than on its leading public personas.</TE>
<TE>   But that evolution in no way diminishes King's remarkably
impressive leadership character, and Frady's modest biography is an
excellent introduction to that man who was King.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm Tired of Violence'</TE>
<TE>   I've decided that I'm going to do battle for my philosophy. You
ought to believe something in life, believe that thing so fervently
that you will stand up with it till the end of your days. I can't
make myself believe that God wants me to hate. I'm tired of violence.
And I'm not going to let my oppressor dictate to me what method I
must use. We have a power, power that can't be found in Molotov
cocktails, but we do have a power. Power that cannot be found in
bullets and guns, but we have a power. It is a power as old as the
insights of Jesus of Nazareth and as modern as the techniques of
Mahatma Gandhi.</TE>

<DH>ROSCOE: A Novel, By William Kennedy, Viking: 294 pp.,
$24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL GORRA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reading William Kennedy's darkly comic new novel, "Roscoe," makes me
suspect that the entire population of Albany, N.Y., once consisted of
ward heelers, prostitutes, bagmen and bent cops. It's a town where no
vote goes unbought and the police run the rackets themselves; a man's
town, in which women matter less than beer or horses. Yet it's also
an oddly egalitarian place, where men of all classes meet as equals
in the bars and back rooms, using one another's first names in
recognition of their shared interest in the crooked machinery of
party politics</LD>
<LD>   "Roscoe" is the seventh of Kennedy's Albany novels, a cycle of
interlocking narratives that trace the fortunes of New York's
unlikely capital from the mid-19th century forward. The best
known--and perhaps indeed the best--of those books remains the
Pulitzer Prize-winning "Ironweed," with its phantasmagoric view of
the city through the eyes of its drunks and derelicts, a novel whose
finest scenes take place in a cemetery. Kennedy's new book, in
contrast, provides a more familiar version of the city's buried
history.</LD>
<TE>   Roscoe Conway is part of the triumvirate in charge of the local
Democrats, and hence the city itself, sharing power with the
patrician Elisha Fitzgibbon and the bootlegging street boss Patsy
McCall. He's a shrewd but tired fiftysomething lawyer with both
literal and metaphoric heart trouble, and in August 1945, Roscoe's
main job is to keep the party one step ahead of Republican state
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Then, just after V-J Day, Elisha, his childhood friend, commits
suicide, and Roscoe needs to find out why and to keep it all quiet.
Pretty soon there's a newspaper editor to punch out, and before he
knows it, Roscoe is juggling a couple of unrelated murders, eight
brothels, an election, a child custody suit, a $40,000 cockfight, his
not-yet consummated love for Elisha's widow, ghosts, surgery and the
eating of a great many oysters.</TE>
<TE>   None of which, the oysters aside, seems at all consequential.
"Roscoe's" complicated plot has holes in it the size of Patsy's kegs.
It's really just a peg on which to hang an atmosphere, a string of
set-pieces to illuminate the shadows that both link and separate
politics and crime. Take Elisha's suicide. Roscoe receives two
autopsy reports, one for Elisha, "dead of coronary occlusion; and one
on Abner Sprule, an alias the party used ... when it suited them.
Chloral hydrate killed Sprule." And the cop in charge adds that
Sprule even has a body: "We got a wino out of the river." Kennedy
never does tell us exactly why Elisha killed himself, and Roscoe
himself doesn't need to know to produce a convincing explanation. For
the truth, as he says, "is in the details, even when you invent the
details."</TE>
<TE>   Roscoe is a wizard at the blarney we now call spin, and Kennedy's
achievement here lies in extending that into a portrait of a society
too openly corrupt to be called dishonest. He shows us how the game
is fixed, whether it's autopsies or elections or cockfights: "The
instant a crooked handler ... touches a chicken, he can secretly
break his thigh with a thumb.... You can also train your bird to lose
... give him a candle to study all night before a fight to paralyze
his pupil.... Or, conversely, put curare on your bird's spurs to
paralyze the enemy ... feed one of your cowards tomato juice to give
him a suntan, the color of winners, but bet him to lose."</TE>
<TE>   I don't expect to try any of it at home, but somehow I'm glad to
know this stuff, just as I am to learn that a tightwad mayor might
"encourage parents to send their kids to Catholic schools; it lowers
the public-school budget." "Roscoe" depends on Kennedy's knowledge of
such street-smart ploys, a mastery that has less in common with
writers such as Saul Bellow or William Faulkner, to whom he is
frequently compared, than it does with someone like Raymond Chandler.
For Kennedy and Chandler describe a society in which some crooks are
honest and most respectable citizens aren't, where everybody has
secrets and lives at some remove from the law, except--or
especially--when they own the law.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are differences, the most important of which is that
while both set their work in the '30s and '40s, Chandler was writing
then too. He didn't have the freedom to describe the full range of
his society's speech or sexual practices. Kennedy does, and his pages
are as pungent as onion, made sharp and raw by his ability to include
everything excluded by the conventions of the time at which his work
is set. Even his liberal use of what most newspapers still consider
an obscenity serves to remind us of the literariness of the
hard-boiled world from which "Roscoe" descends, a reminder that makes
Kennedy look realistic by comparison.</TE>
<TE>   It's an illusion, of course, and another of the differences
between Chandler and Kennedy suggests that the latter's world too is
a product of his artifice and skill. Everyone in Chandler's
California wants to start fresh, to lose the past; and the
detective's job is to uncover their secret histories. In Kennedy's
Albany, by contrast, everyone has always known everyone else and
their grandparents too. Yet secrets stay in the family, however
extended; the whole city may know who killed gangster Legs Diamond,
but some things aren't fit for the papers. Kennedy's people have long
memories, and his books are marked by flashbacks within flashbacks,
stories told and retold until they take on the shape of myth. To both
Roscoe Conway and this eponymous novel, 1932 or 1917 or even his 19th
century boyhood remain as vivid as the present.</TE>
<TE>   The dovetailing of one year with another, the return of old
acquaintances, of tales heard elsewhere and from another point of
view--these are among the pleasures of the Albany novels, and also
among their problems. This book's predecessor, "The Flaming Corsage,"
presumed a detailed knowledge of Kennedy's other work; "Roscoe"
doesn't, though it wouldn't hurt to know the cycle's earliest
volumes, "Legs" and "Billy Phelan's Greatest Game." Nevertheless
Kennedy does have trouble keeping himself from dotting the i's of his
world, too often pausing to offer the entire family histories of
characters who, in this novel at least, may exist only for a
paragraph. And there are problems with "Roscoe" as well. Having made
him half Falstaff and half Micawber, the confident master of a
fraudulent world, Kennedy finds it hard to involve us as fully as he
wants in the character's romantic fate.</TE>
<TE>   But those are only blemishes on the skin of this ripely
entertaining novel. They don't really touch its sour-sweet flavor.
"Roscoe" has its pungent life in its saloons and restaurants and
whispered exchanges in hotel lobbies; in a brothel called the
Notchery, "luxuriously furnished for a whorehouse"; in Roscoe's
drawer of twenties and his claim that as "I am incapable of truth ...
so am I incapable of lying." But though Roscoe Conway himself may
never quite tell the truth, in such details as these, "Roscoe"
certainly does.</TE>

<LD>SNOW DAY</LD>
<LD>   By Lynn Plourde, illustrated by Hideko Takahashi</LD>
<LD>   Simon &amp; Schuster: 32 pp., $16</LD>
<TE>   "Yawn./ Hug the pillow./ A cozy, curled lump in the quilt./ Mama
whispers, 'Snow day, child.'/ The quilt bursts open./ Is it ... /
Could it ... / Would it be?" To a child, perhaps no two words inspire
greater joy than Plourde's ("Pigs in the Mud in the Middle of the
Rud") titular phrase. For the family--freed from school, released
from work and not tethered to the television set--the day is defined
by its events. They eat "plumpy pumpkin muffins" on a "yummy snow
day"; watch the "wild, whirling wind" on a "fierce snow day"; and
enjoy "checkers and chuckles" on a "playful snow day."</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Plourde's snappy verse, with its brief phrases and effective
use of onomatopoeia, convey the active pace from wake-up to
wind-down. Hideko Takahashi's ("Beach Play") bold acrylics feature
the wide-eyed, exuberant brother and sister in crisp winter
landscapes and cozy scenes by the hearth. (Ages 3-6)</TE>

<TE>   FOREST FRIENDS' FIVE SENSES</TE>
<TE>   By Cristina Garelli, illustrated by Francesca Chessa</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 32 pp., $14.95</TE>
<TE>   In this tale from the team behind "Farm Friends Clean Up," five
forest inhabitants gather around the campfire and take turns
responding to Boar's prompt, "Who has a story about one of the five
senses?" Hawk tells of the time that his impaired vision caused him
to crash into a mountain; Bear was once stung by a bee (on the
tongue) while foraging and couldn't taste honey.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, in each case, Dr. Owl was around to dispense the
appropriate medical care--whether it meant plucking splinters from
Squirrel's paws or cleaning excess wax from Rabbit's ears so he could
hear again. Though the premise is forced, the text may inspire some
cause-and-effect discussions about the five senses from young
readers, and may even placate those who fear going to the doctor. But
it's Francesca Chessa's earth-toned, dense brushwork that supplies
the book's real pleasure. Making the most of the book's oblong
format, she stretches many of her full-bleed scenes across an entire
spread for maximum visual impact. In one humorous vignette, a
bewildered-looking Skunk--who has been sprayed accidentally by a
friend but is so congested that he can't smell the results--occupies
one end of a seesaw, while all his animal friends huddle together at
the other end, holding their own or each other's noses. (Ages 3-6)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MOLLY AND THE MAGIC DRESS</TE>
<TE>   By William Norwich, illustrated by M. Scott Miller</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday: 42 pp., $16.95</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Eloise hoists high society on its own petard even while it
preserves the Plaza's allure, this upscale fairy tale vacillates
between irony and ingenuous optimism. Molly and her slinky calico cat
share an elegant Manhattan apartment with Molly's platinum-coifed
mother and a prim, plump housekeeper. Although she wears a frock from
Paris to her cousin's wedding, Molly prefers her "magic" dress, an
off-pink relic with an unraveling lace hem: "It turned Molly into
anyone she wished. All she needed to say was 'Perfect dress in a
perfect world, take me into another whirl.'" During the ritzy
reception at the Knickerbilt Club, Molly escapes to a quiet room to
put on her shabby garment. To her surprise, she finds a homeless
woman. Molly convinces her to put on the magic dress, the party
guests walk in and suddenly, "They were all staring at the Queen of
England!" Depending on the reader, the magic-dress conceit might be
whimsical or satirical; the florid narration and prodigally happy
ending make it hard to tell. William Norwich, entertaining editor of
the New York Times Magazine, relies heavily on stereotypes and the
pretentiousness of the delivery undercuts the social critique.
Likewise, debut illustrator M. Scott Miller skewers the elite without
evoking any warmth for the title character; his caricatures of the
moneyed class have a dry-cleaned artificiality. (All ages)</TE>

<TE>   I LOVE SATURDAYS Y DOMINGOS</TE>
<TE>   By Alma Flor Ada, illustrated by Elivia Savadier</TE>
<TE>   Simon &amp; Schuster/Atheneum: 32 pp., $16.95</TE>
<TE>   Through this affectionate and revealing portrait of a bilingual
girl's weekend visits to her two sets of grandparents, Alma Flor Ada
("Where the Flame Trees Bloom") and Elivia Savadier ("A Bedtime
Story") prove that straddling two worlds can be a blessing rather
than a hardship. The left of each spread depicts the narrator
spending Saturdays with her paternal grandparents, with whom she
speaks English; on the right, she passes los domingos (Sundays) with
her Mexican-American abuelito and abuelita and converses in Spanish.
The situations in the two households share enough similarities that
readers can extrapolate the meaning of the Spanish words in context.
For instance, on one spread, the colors of the balloons her paternal
grandparents give her also appear in the kite that her abuelito makes
for her. Each pairing makes for a loving comparison and contrast,
enlivened by Savadier's graceful, warm-toned watercolor spot
illustrations. At book's end, both sets of grandparents coordinate a
cooperative gift for the girl's birthday. The balance tips slightly
in Abuelito and Abuelita's favor, in terms of fun and exoticism
(Grandpa and Grandma watch a video about the circus while the
Mexican-American grandparents "take me to a real circus").
Youngsters, however, will come away with the idea that this girl is
very lucky to have four such interesting people who love her. (Ages
4-8)</TE>

<LD>   DOWN BY THE LEMONADE SPRINGS: Essays on Wallace Stegner, By
Jackson J. Benson</LD>
<TE>   The body of Jim Morrison was buried in a sealed coffin in a Paris
graveyard, a fact witnessed by the few who attended the interment in
1971. Thus did the richly storied life of the lead singer of the
Doors, dead of heart failure at the age of 27, come to a sad and
squalid end.</TE>
<TE>   "Or was it, in fact, a hoax?" muses Ray Manzarek in "The Poet in
Exile," a novel that invents a new variation on the myth of Morrison.
"Was it all an elaborate ruse to free the Poet from his worldly
entanglements, including his now increasingly heroin-intoxicated
mistress, and send him off to ports unknown where he could pursue his
craft unencumbered?"</TE>
<TE>   As imagined by Manzarek, co-founder and keyboardist of the Doors,
the "rock God" is not dead and buried. Rather, he has contrived to
escape from the sycophants who only encouraged his drinking and other
excesses--"the La Brea Mafia," as Manzarek puts it--by faking his own
demise and going so deeply underground that the graveside charade in
Paris seems believable precisely because the deity himself is nowhere
to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "The Poet was gone," writes Manzarek. "And we all wept for him.
And our tears were applause for the efficacy of an illusion."</TE>
<TE>   "The Poet in Exile," of course, is presented as a work of
fiction--the Poet, whom we are supposed to recognize as Morrison, is
dubbed Jordan, and Manzarek's alter ego is called Roy. Morrison
styled himself as the "Lizard King" and Manzarek calls Jordan the
"Snake Man." But the author writes with a wink and nod, and he
clearly hopes to enlist his readers in yet another twist on the myth
that Morrison cultivated during his own lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   The yarn begins when a letter arrives at Roy's home in Los
Angeles--the missive was mailed in the far-off Seychelles, the
message is deeply and characteristically enigmatic and the signature
is a single scrawled letter: "J." Agitated and intrigued, Roy goes in
search of the West Coast wild man, whom he understands to be its
author, and, in a real sense, his own history and destiny.</TE>
<TE>   Roy casts his memory back to the dues-paying years of the rock
band that J fronted, a band that goes coyly unnamed in the book: "We
were touched by tongues of fire in the little El Segundo beach house
that we used as our rehearsal space," he recalls. "We were just
trying to take it a little higher. You know, like Van Morrison says,
'Into the Mystic.'" And when Roy finally finds himself face-to-face
with the self-styled Snake Man, now older and grayer but no less
charismatic, he is aquiver with curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   "I've only just begun to unravel this mystery," says Roy. "I've
got a million questions. And...Jordan, you're going to answer every
one of them."</TE>
<TE>   The Poet proceeds to describe his journey from substance abuse to
spiritual ecstasy, a narrative that ends with a moment of authentic
surprise and heart-tugging poignancy. Ultimately, however, the
answers provided by the resurrected "rock God" are no more mysterious
than the customary on-camera confessions that can be seen on any
episode of VH1's "Behind the Music." "I was a success, I was famous,
I had money in the bank ... and I had nothing," declares Jordan.
"Except a bad hangover." And when Roy finds him to be clean and sober
after his long years of self-exile, it's almost a disappointment:
"You're a good and decent human being now," announces Roy. "You're
not the Snake Man anymore."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Al Hirschfeld's pen-and-ink caricatures are as emblematic of the
New York theater scene as Sardi's or Times Square. Yet, as we
discover in "Hirschfeld's Hollywood," he started out in the motion
picture industry--and he never really left it behind.</TE>
<TE>   "[H]is first theatrical drawing was published in December 1926,"
explains David Leopold, an archivist and curator of Hirschfeld's
artwork. "By then, he was a veteran of studio publicity and
advertising departments, having already worked for Goldwyn,
Universal, Pathe, Selznick, Fox, First National, and Warner Bros."</TE>
<TE>   Co-published by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences,
and based on an exhibit of Hirschfeld's artwork at the academy,
"Hirschfeld's Hollywood" includes more than 100 posters, billboards,
murals, paintings, drawings and other artwork, all of which celebrate
Hollywood rather than Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   And, remarkably, the artwork that is presented so elegantly and
yet so playfully in "Hirschfeld's Hollywood" spans nine decades of
glitter and glamour, thus reminding us that Hirschfeld is still
active as he approaches his 100th birthday: When the Oscar
nominations were announced in 2001, the New York Times had Hirschfeld
draw the nominees.</TE>
<TE>   "From Astaire to Zorina," as Larry Gelbart sums up in a foreword
to the book, "from Dove to Hawks, from Pidgeon to Crowe."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Does Wallace Stegner belong in the pantheon of American authors
that includes such luminaries as Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck?</TE>
<TE>   Jackson J. Benson, professor emeritus at San Diego State
University, has devoted his life's work to the study of these three
writers, and he makes the case for Stegner in "Down by the Lemonade
Springs," a collection of his biographical and critical essays that
illuminates Stegner in ways that are intended not merely to heighten
our regard for him but to deepen the experience of reading his
writings.</TE>
<TE>   Stegner was not only a man of letters--an accomplished novelist,
historian and biographer--but also a beloved teacher of writing at
Stanford and a fiery environmental activist. The crown jewel among
his novels, "Angle of Repose," was honored with a Pulitzer Prize in
1972, but Benson also wants us to know that Stegner was presented
with a Freedom to Write Award by PEN Center USA West in 1992 when he
refused to accept a national arts medal from then-President George
Bush in protest against acts of censorship by the National Endowment
for the Arts.</TE>
<TE>   "A truth seeker" is how Benson describes Stegner, "who tried to
see himself, his history, his land, and his people as clearly as
possible and to pass on those discoveries to others."</TE>
<TE>   Benson is candid about his own high esteem for Stegner: "I spent
several weeks a year, off and on, with him for nearly seven years,"
writes Benson. "He was simply the brightest man I had ever known."
But he is also willing to confront some of the less endearing
qualities that he discerns in Stegner and his writing: "Like the work
of one of his mentors, Robert Frost, his writing had both a sunny and
a dark side," Benson explains. "What he said about Frost was just as
true for him: 'The real jolt and force of Frost's love of life comes
from the fact that it is cold at the root.'"</TE>
<TE>   The highest and best use of "Down by the Lemonade Springs" is as a
companion to Stegner's work. "Angle of Repose," for example, is
surely one of the greatest of American novels, but the experience of
reading (or rereading) Stegner's masterpiece will be all the greater
in the light of what Benson reveals about how it came to be written
in the first place.</TE>

<HD>The Getaway Artist</HD>
<DH>COLLECTED STORIES, By Saul Bellow, Viking: 442 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE SIEGEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If society knew what was good for it, Saul Bellow would be in jail.
For behind the great fortune of Bellow's imagination lies the idea of
crime. Along with writers from Andre Gide to Isaac Babel to Norman
Mailer, Bellow likes to toy with an analogy between lawbreakers and
art makers; he sees both the criminal and the artist as original,
elemental personalities. Crime as a motif runs through "Collected
Stories" like a bright green thread, most strikingly in "A Silver
Dish," one of several masterpieces included here.</LD>
<LD>   After his father's death, Woody Selbst reexamines his own divided
life. The product of a British-Jewish mother who became a fanatical
Christian convert and a Polish-Jewish father who left Woody's mother
for a married Catholic named Halina, Woody occupies two worlds.</LD>
<TE>   Woody recalls a day in his adolescence when Morris, his father,
reappeared and told him a tale about how he desperately needed money
to pay back Halina, who had stolen $50 to help Morris out. Bring me
to Mrs. Skoglund, Morris says--a rich, suppressive fundamentalist
Christian who is Woody's patron--and together we'll ask her to lend
us the money. Woody knows that there's something rotten about the
story, but he and his father travel through a Chicago snowstorm to
old Mrs. Skoglund's palatial home. After hearing their story, Mrs.
Skoglund decides she needs to be alone for a few moments to ask God
for guidance. As soon as she's gone, Morris declares (wrongly) to
Woody that she'll never give up the money, and he grabs an
expensive-looking silver dish from a cabinet and stuffs it down his
pants.</TE>
<TE>   The image serves a remarkable purpose. Throughout the story,
Bellow vividly describes church bells ringing: "The last of the bells
still had the bright air streaming with vibrations." Silver is the
stuff of spiritual bells and, by having Morris shove Mrs. Skoglund's
dish next to his groin, Bellow fancifully weds spirituality to
libido. After all, Bellow describes Morris, a con man and thief, as a
man who is "vital and picturesque," an advocate of "real life and
free instincts, against religion and hypocrisy."</TE>
<TE>   Morris maddens and exasperates Woody, but Woody loves him above
anyone else; he crawls into his father's hospital bed and holds the
old man as he dies. "Pop divided himself. And when he was separated
from his warmth, he slipped into death." Perhaps we are all dead when
we separate ourselves from our warmth, from the part of us that
steps, for the sake of life, beyond law and convention.</TE>
<TE>   Crime in literature has something to do with the desire of
sensitive bookish male authors, their ambition sheltered and fueled
by tender, maternal affection, to triumph over an untender and
unmaternal world. In Bellow's art, however, the bookish son's alter
ego is also the quiet outsider, expelled to society's margins by
exotic aspirations that flow from peculiar gifts. Such a figure's
toughness expresses itself through guile more than through physical
force. The type of criminal that inhabits the core of Bellow's
imagination is not the man who has the capacity to injure or kill but
the man who takes chances that defy social habits and routines; not
the murderer or violent burglar but the gambler and the con man.</TE>
<TE>   In his passionately intelligent introduction to this volume, James
Wood writes that "Bellow's characters all yearn to make something of
their lives in the religious sense." Yet Wood is also keenly aware of
Bellow's joy in sensuous worldly intensity. Bellow's characters, in
fact, yearn to make something of their lives in a world where
religion is insufficient for living a modern life. They wish to make
sense of their own selves, while religion leads one away from the
self. The gambler recasts his identity every time he does or doesn't
beat the odds.</TE>
<TE>   It's too bad that this wonderful, indispensable book does not
quite live up to its claim of being the "collected" stories. Several
tales have been left out that would have sharply illuminated Bellow's
development as a writer, and one of them, "Two Morning Monologues,"
captures Bellow's obsessive identification of crime with imaginative
freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing in Partisan Review when Bellow was in his late 20s, the
story concerns a young man who finds himself at loose ends, lacking a
job and a conventional purpose in life. In his first monologue, he
labors under doubt and hesitation, waiting for his inertia to blossom
into an exceptional destiny. His second monologue carries a much
different tone. Unfolding crisply in the idiom of the gambler or the
con man, it is a crackling rumination that celebrates risk and danger
and flies in the face of convention.</TE>
<TE>   This theme of lawbreaking grows throughout Bellow's work into a
mighty world view. Augie March supports himself by stealing books;
the down-at-his-heels hero of "Seize the Day" humorously wishes that
he could expropriate the money of old people. The intellectual
historian Herzog, in the novel of that name, relishes the fact that
Willie Sutton, the legendary bank robber, read the entire set of
Encyclopaedia Britannica while serving a life sentence; "Humboldt's
Gift's" Charlie Citrine is fascinated and repelled by a gangster who
smashes Citrine's Mercedes with a baseball bat and invites him to
have a menage a trois with him and his girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Though Bellow portrays no gamblers or con men in the short stories
gathered here, he gives us plenty of risk-taking and crime. "A
Theft"--originally published as a novella--turns on the suspected
pilfering of an emerald ring and the series of risks that the story's
female protagonist takes in trying to retrieve it. In "Looking for
Mr. Green," George Grebe is, like the hero of "Two Morning
Monologues," jobless and at loose ends. He is thus yet another
version of the authentic outsider, of the artist free to gamble with
his destiny. "He felt that his luck was better than usual today,"
Bellow tells us. Finally finding employment at a public assistance
agency, Grebe is assigned the job of giving a black man named
Tulliver Green his welfare check, but Green proves to be as elusive
as reality itself. Indeed, by the end of the story, Grebe's search
for Green becomes an odyssey of chance-taking and self-invention.</TE>
<TE>   Bellow often associates a larcenous mentality with an appetite for
living, and he identifies an appetite for living with the artist's
gift. In "Mosby's Memoirs," Hymen Lustgarten is a simple man from
Newark who goes to Europe to make money on the black market.
Lustgarten is a ludicrous figure, not at all equipped for the schemes
he has hatched in his oversized imagination. His plan to take his
American Cadillac to Europe and sell it for a fortune ends in
brilliant comic disaster. Yet Mosby, the cold-blooded memoirist and
consummate respectable insider who derisively recalls Lustgarten's
escapade, experiences something like a minor breakdown when he
realizes how empty his life is alongside Lustgarten's vital
imagination and will.</TE>
<TE>   In the extraordinary "Something to Remember Me By," an adolescent
boy has his money and his clothes stolen by a prostitute. He in turn
steals clothes from three different strangers to keep himself warm as
he makes his way home through a blizzard to his parents' house, where
his mother lies dying. Once there, he resolves to repay a debt that
he incurred on his journey by stealing the money from his mother, who
has hidden the bills "in her mahzor, the prayer book for the High
Holidays, the days of awe." But since it is a sin to to keep money in
the prayer book, let alone to handle money on the days of awe, the
boy's mother is as much a lawbreaker as her son. In this way, the boy
will crown his three thievish transformations of identity with a
sensational minor crime. But it is not really a crime. About to pass
to the other side, the mother has bequeathed the boy something sacred
in the form of something profane. She has taught him that the way to
pass from death to life--from being naked in a blizzard to being
wrapped in warmth at home--is to take a transforming leap of faith
over hindering rules. Like all the gamblers and mild lawbreakers in
Bellow's fiction, the boy suddenly gains a second life in the daring
of his imagination.</TE>

<TE>   From `A Silver Dish'</TE>
<TE>   After a time, Pop's resistance ended. He subsided and subsided. He
rested against his son, his small body curled there. Nurses came and
looked. They disapproved, but Woody, who couldn't spare a hand to
wave them out, motioned with his head toward the door. Pop, whom
Woody thought he had stilled, had only found a better way to get
around him. Loss of heat was the way he did it. His heat was leaving
him. As can happen with small animals while you hold them in your
hand, Woody presently felt him cooling. Then, as Woody did his best
to restrain him, and thought he was succeeding, Pop divided himself.
And when he was separated from his warmth, he slipped into death. And
there was his elderly, large, muscular son, still holding and
pressing him when there was nothing anymore to press. You could never
pin down that self-willed man. When he was ready to make his move, he
made it--always on his own terms. And always, always, something up
his sleeve. That was how he was.</TE>

<DH>ARNOLD SCHOENBERG'S JOURNEY, By Allen Shawn, Farrar, Straus
&amp; Giroux:,  272 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN LEVI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why would anyone pick up Allen Shawn's "Arnold Schoenberg's Journey"?
Schoenberg's rep has become that of the surgeon who replaced the
heart of music with a mathematical machine called "the 12-tone row"
and, worse still, the pagan who assassinated key structure and
replaced it with the godless relativism of atonality, in which every
pitch is just as important as every other.</LD>
<LD>   With the joy of the boy who fell in love with Schoenberg when he
was a 13-year-old piano student, Shawn claims that the music of
Schoenberg, in fact, is "no more 'difficult' than the work of other
early-twentieth-century modernists such as Kandinsky, Eliot, Kafka,
or Joyce, for whom even the general public has a feeling of
affection, of receptivity, of the kind of trust that one accords
great art in which there is much that one simply doesn't grasp--at
first or perhaps even ever."</LD>
<TE>   While one might wonder in which of America's shopping malls one
might find this "general public" with a crush on Kandinsky (although
T.S. Eliot perhaps deserves a star in the pavement as the original
lyricist for "Cats"), the 50-year scope of Schoenberg's work--from
his 1899 romantic "Verklarte Nacht" through the "orgiastically
beautiful evening-length" "Gurrelieder," the remarkable cycle of
words and music that make up his "Pierrot Lunaire" through his 1947
unabashedly 12-tone Piano Concert--is a Baedeker of European
classical music from Brahms to Boulez.</TE>
<TE>   Schoenberg's own personal journey, although well-documented, is
fascinating. A secular Jew born into the cultural mecca of Vienna,
Schoenberg was in all senses a self-made man with a contrarian streak
that discouraged any who might want to help make him. He taught
himself composition. At age 25, he converted to Lutheranism. Then in
Paris, 35 years later, in the wake of the rise of Adolf Hitler, he
converted back to Judaism, with Marc Chagall at his right hand
holding the tallis. He eventually found a haven teaching in America,
not among the ivies but beneath the palms of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Yet what is left of Schoenberg 50 years after his death? Tonality
is as rampant as kudzu in contemporary conservatories. The revolution
that shocked audiences is passe, if even remembered. It is not
Shawn's goal to answer that question. He describes his book as
neither a biography nor a musical study "but rather a linked series
of visits to points of interest in Schoenberg's life--'soundings,' if
you will." Not entirely facetiously, Shawn declares his intention to
give Schoenberg's work "a more superficial treatment than it has
hitherto received."</TE>
<TE>   And Shawn's is certainly not the magisterial examination of
Charles Rosen's 1975 critical biography or the careful consideration
of Robert Craft's essays that championed Schoenberg and his
arch-rival Igor Stravinsky. Nor does it advance our knowledge of
Schoenberg beyond what Walter Frisch compiled in his 1999 collection,
"Schoenberg and His World."</TE>
<TE>   Shawn takes an eclectic approach, sometimes using Schoenberg's
painting (from self-portraits, landscapes and somewhat fantastical
abstract canvases that Schoenberg painted between 1906 and 1912) as a
guide to the music, sometimes sugaring the book with anecdotes of his
own relationship as a listener and a teacher of the composer's works.
Even so, Shawn feels the necessity, fairly frequently, of injecting
arguments that need the illustration of written music--and therefore
require not only musical literacy on the part of the reader but a
handy piano.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Shawn, a composer and teacher, writes with an enthusiasm
for the music of words, a passion he evidently inhaled as a child of
the New Yorker's longtime editor William Shawn and continues to
breathe as the husband of writer Jamaica Kincaid. If Shawn's
exhalations lead readers to put down the book and put on a CD of
Schoenberg's opera "Moses und Aron," the maestro could hardly
complain.</TE>

<DH>THE DEVIL'S DETAILS: A History of Footnotes, By Chuck
Zerby, Invisible Cities Press:  150 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM H. McNEILL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>THE DEVIL'S DETAILS: A History of Footnotes, By Chuck Zerby, Invisible
Cities Press:</LD>
<LD>   This quirky little essay takes off with the words: "The need for
an adequate book on footnotes is obvious. One of the earliest and
most ingenious inventions of humankind, the footnote has been for
centuries an indispensable tool of the scholar and a source of
endlessly varied delight for the layperson." And, after deploring the
recent decay of the footnote because publishers dislike it, Chuck
Zerby gets down to his subject by saying that "the main job of the
footnote is to interrupt. Simply interrupt." The rest of "The Devil's
Details" is, accordingly, a series of disjointed meditations,
abundantly interrupted by footnotes and by learned whimsy.</LD>
<TE>   Zerby embarks on an elaborate search for the first footnote and
finds it in the Book of Job in the so-called "Bishop's Bible,"
published in England in 1568: When the publisher ran out of space for
marginal notes he printed two of them, (f) and (g), at the bottom of
the page. Having hailed the significance of this invention in
extravagant terms, Zerby takes refuge in a footnote of his own: "Just
as astronomers know that earlier and earlier stars will be found, we
expect someday our research will be superseded by the discovery of an
earlier footnote.... This author with the cooperation of Invisible
Cities Press is offering a modest but appropriate recognition for the
discoverer ... who will be given a celebratory dinner at a restaurant
of his or her choice for up to one hundred dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Zerby devotes two of his seven chapters to footnotes to poems, a
subject I was surprised to learn existed. Abraham Cowley, for
example, a minor 17th century English poet, published a heroic poem
about King David, whose first book "has the satisfying ratio of
sixteen pages of notes to twenty-four pages of verse." But his
achievement was, according to Zerby, surpassed by Aphra Benn (died
1689), who made witty footnotes take an active part in shaping her
readers' response. Alexander Pope's "The Dunciad" marked the apex of
poetic footnoting, but modern practitioners have included T.S. Eliot,
Marianne Moore and a more obscure poet named Christopher Ward, who
improved on his predecessors by taking his footnotes and versifying
them.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to scholarly and historical footnoting, Zerby ranks
18th century philosopher Pierre Bayle and historian Edward Gibbon
above all others. "Bayle is the Mozart of the footnote" while
Gibbon's are "where the scholar pops out of his office to stretch his
legs, and, meeting colleagues, gossips ... and feels free to offer
opinions based on nothing but his prejudices and whims." Decline
began in the next century with historians Leopold von Ranke, who
"failed to see the dramatic possibilities of footnotes," and Lord
Thomas Babington Macaulay, "whose genius, as this footnote
demonstrates, was to combine balanced sentences with unbalanced
enthusiasms."</TE>
<TE>   Then, with the 20th century, serious decay set in. Humorists
attacked footnotes on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1920s;
publishers banished them to the back of books in the 1930s. With the
dawn of the Internet, the threat of virtual footnotes, erasable at
the stroke of a finger, suddenly looms. Zerby proposes "a
well-funded, broadly representative international committee to
explore and establish a policy for the encouragement and preservation
of the venerable and endangered footnote" to enable it to "fly once
again in virtual reality--proud, virile and redundant." I agree with
Zerby that footnotes belong at the bottom of the page, and I wish all
readers and publishers agreed with us. But some fully literate
persons, including my wife, positively dislike what they find to be
the distraction of footnotes, and if they are a majority, I am
reconciled to the extra effort needed to follow an author's argument
by consulting notes at the back of the book.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, I emphatically disagree with Zerby's view that
the proper function of footnotes is to offer readers a refreshing
interruption from engagement with a (presumably) dull text. Citation
of the source of a quote or idea or piece of information is surely
the central role for responsible footnoting. And citing one's sources
accurately is not a trivial matter. It holds erratic personal memory
in check and acknowledges debts, while incidentally also establishing
a scholar's claim to participate in a given universe of discourse.</TE>
<TE>   The sour view that citations simply allow "scholarly readers to
purloin my citations without having to give me a reference" points to
another abuse. But without footnote citations the fabric of scholarly
discourse would wither, disagreements would have to be vented haute
voix in the text, while friendly nods and generous confessions of
indebtedness would have to find more awkward, perhaps less frequent,
expression.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, footnotes have a second, discursive function that seems
more important than the amusing or refreshing interruptions that
Zerby celebrates. I used to reserve any imperfectly thought-through
hunches for footnotes; and off-the-top-of-the-head suggestions and
inquiries can sometimes stimulate someone else to pursue the matter
in earnest. Indeed, because a writer told me so, I happen to know
that at least once I did provoke this younger and linguistically
qualified person to write a history of the Crim Tartars. This sort of
outreach toward untrodden ground is, or ought to be, an integral part
of scholarly discourse and is more than a mere interruption of the
argument.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, footnoting can be overdone. Vainglorious exhibitions
of learning with nothing important to report are an occupational
hazard for academics faced with the "publish or perish" imperative of
a modern university. But celebrating footnotes as amusing
interruptions seems a poor defense against such abuses. It is also a
poor way to resuscitate the endangered footnote that Zerby so
deplores.</TE>

<HD>A Conversation With William Kennedy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Your last novel, "The Flaming Corsage," appeared in 1996.
Have you been working on "Roscoe" since then?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: "Roscoe" was my main thrust after that book, and it was
very hard to write. My problem was the character of Roscoe himself.
It took a long time to feel comfortable with him. There are real
counterparts for some people in my book: boss Patsy McCall, Mayor
Alex Fitzgibbon [Elisha's son], the governor, and of course Legs
Diamond, but there were none who could do what I wanted my
protagonist to do. Either they weren't smart enough or couldn't see
themselves or were too remote from the center of power. I needed a
serious intelligence who was central to the machine from the
beginning on through 1945, and it turned out I had to invent that
fellow Roscoe. He'd be secretary of the party, a lawyer, a brilliant
rascal with a very peculiar conscience and a romantic heart. Amoral
but with soul.</LD>
<LD>   Q: You were born and raised in Albany, N.Y. How did your
background help you in creating the atmosphere of "Roscoe"?</LD>
<TE>   A: I've been writing this book for 40 years, covering politics for
daily journalism, writing essays about the people. Also I was a
Depression child, grew up when the machine was forming itself. You'd
think this would make it easy, but immersion like that makes you
crazy, for you know there's far more than can be seen or even that
one man can know. You have to keep reporting and interpreting; but
how and when do you winnow it all down to a story? Answer: Do what
you can with history, then let the imagination do the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When you wrote the first of your books with an Albany setting
back in the 1960s, "The Ink Truck," did you know that you were going
to go on to write a series of linked books?</TE>
<TE>   A: No, I couldn't even have predicted the books would stay in
Albany. But in time I loved the place and knew I didn't have to go
elsewhere. This was a mother lode of material. I did have an early
fascination for the way [William] Faulkner intertwined the books in
his saga, and the way [J.D.] Salinger's Glass family members
overlapped in his stories: So I guess there was some intuition that I
might someday do something similar. But I had no plan. The books
evolved one by one. And after "Ironweed" I called them a cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why did you make Albany the center of your work?</TE>
<TE>   A: The politics grabbed me, and in the 1960s I wanted to write a
novel on the Machine and the Boss who were classically corrupt and
unbeatable. But I didn't understand politics of this sort well
enough, and the next 40 years were a learning experience. As to the
town, it's full of history, as old as the nation and almost as
varied. Writers often go off seeking the exotic to rouse their muses,
and some just don't function well on home turf. But if you look at
any place seriously, you can find extraordinary history waiting to be
discovered. You just have to go after it vertically. Look what
Sherwood Anderson did with "Winesburg, Ohio." He made a crossroads
village immortal.</TE>
<TE>   Q: If Roscoe Conway were alive today, would he be a successful
politician?</TE>
<TE>   A: He'd be successful under any circumstances, just as Bill
Clinton would if he hadn't gone into politics. I'm in no way equating
Roscoe with Clinton in terms of chicanery, just in their acute
intelligence and aggression, qualities that lead to success. Roscoe's
comprehension of human behavior, his talent for manipulating others,
his gift of gab and his wit--these are characteristics of successful
people. Roscoe would adapt to all things. If he lived in Hollywood,
he'd be a head of studio.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is "Roscoe" the last Albany book?</TE>
<TE>   A: Hardly. I've got another novel just starting to cook. And as to
Albany, the material can't be exhausted. I'm chasing all sorts of
unknowns, in the city and in myself, and my conclusion is that the
cycle will end only when I do. What's still surviving are the
visions--of real history and re-imaginable history. They coalesce
after a while, and at the moment, they're both only 74 years old, and
not counting.</TE>

<LD>LAZY B</LD>
<LD>   Growing Up on a Cattle Ranch in the American Southwest</LD>
<LD>   By Sandra Day O'Connor and H. Alan Day</LD>
<TE>   Random House: 316 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   The language in the memoir of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor and her brother H. Alan Day about growing up on the
largest cattle ranch in Arizona (160,000 acres) reminds me of those
no-nonsense New England memoirs that conceal a disdain for the
seduction of beauty over hardiness. The moral is: Hard work builds
integrity. Don't expect anyone else to do yours for you. Do the best
you can or don't bother.</TE>
<TE>   "Lazy B" is organized by chapters describing family members and
people who lived and worked on the ranch, like Bronco Busting Jim or
Bug the Cook. What interests O'Connor most about them is their work
ethic. Her father emerges as a powerful, capable lord of his own
domain, meting out justice that is always deserved, never questioned.
Her mother never falters, never seems to tire of ranch life, is
always immaculately dressed and someone a child could be proud of.</TE>
<TE>   We are not used to life stories in which emotional hurdles are
leaped in a single bound. There is much to learn here about roping
and herding and training horses and daily ranch life. But we never
learn why one of her aunts died at 20 or why it is OK to refer to
living creatures as "a particularly surly mess of beef"? O'Connor has
a remarkably detailed memory. A passage that describes how one ranch
hand rolled his cigarettes is downright cinematic. How the cowboys
moved and did their work is as vivid as the emotional terrain is
unclear.</TE>

<TE>   CRASHING THE PARTY</TE>
<TE>   How to Tell the Truth and Still Run for President</TE>
<TE>   By Ralph Nader</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Dunne Books/</TE>
<TE>   St. Martin's Press: 358 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Nothing makes your average middle-class liberal madder than the
mention of Ralph Nader's name. Not even naming Richard Nixon. Nader's
explanation for their anger? Democrats "not only fear but despise
idealism." Idealism, he writes with characteristic humility, "took a
stand in 2000." In "Crashing the Party," Nader describes his
motivation to run, how he ran his campaign, what it stood for and
what he hopes the Green Party will accomplish in the future. Some of
the book tackles those moments in the campaign that he considers
particularly disappointing: when, for instance, Gloria Steinem
abandoned him, or when he was accused of saying that there were no
differences between Bush and Gore (he claims to have said that there
were "few differences") and when some Democrats claimed that "a vote
for Nader was a vote for Bush." ("Bush," Nader writes, "is a mindless
pusher for laws that shield corporations from being held
accountable," what he calls "tort deform.") He is particularly proud
of running an $8-million campaign, as opposed to Al Gore's
$120-million and Bush's $186-million efforts. He makes, again, an
excellent case for the need for another party and for a revitalized
Democratic Party. In the end, he seems pleased with what the Greens
accomplished and stands by his course. "The fissure opened by this
modest Green Party campaign proved to be a much deeper fault line
between liberals who believed there were no alternatives and liberals
who had endured enough of the commercialized politics of concessions
and broken promises."</TE>

<TE>   A HOUSE IN CORFU</TE>
<TE>   A Family's Sojourn in Greece</TE>
<TE>   By Emma Tennant</TE>
<TE>   Henry Holt: 256 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Our supply of Peter Mayle bourgeois fugitives has dwindled
severely in the last few years. After Francis Mayes' second book on
Tuscany, it's been downright spotty. Until now.</TE>
<TE>   Emma Tennant's father, an architect at the head of his own firm in
London, picked up in 1965 and moved to Corfu. He designed and built
this house on 12 acres with a view of one of the most beautiful bays
on the island that he had purchased. He wanted to spend his remaining
years painting and sailing, a dream he realized until his death in
1983. They meld as much as possible into village life in Liapades, on
the east side of Corfu. Tennant's life as a freelance writer in
London seems barely able to compete with the paradise her parents
created. Her descriptions of the island (flora and culture) remind me
of Sarah Orne Jewett's descriptions of Maine, but her mind's
wanderings on Greek history or "The Odyssey" or Lawrence Durrell and
Edward Lear are a bit choppy and hard to follow. In Greece, she
explains, you're never alone. In fact, the word for "private" in
Greek, she writes is "idiotikos." Tennant describes the spirit of
enjoying another culture more gently, less aggressively than Mayle or
even Mayes. She floats through it more dreamily, leaving an even
greater desire for some other place.</TE>

<LD>   DANCE OF DAYS: Two Decades of Punk  in the Nation's Capital, By
Mark Andersen</LD>
<LD>   At the art school where I teach, the kids still wear purple
mohawks. They practice extreme piercing and happily regard themselves
as anarchists. They are, in brief, punks. Punk--the music, the
fashion, the philosophy, the attitude--is surprisingly central to our
era. Which is good, because punk--the music, the fashion, the
philosophy, the attitude--rocks.</LD>
<TE>   The counterculture of the '60s, with its music and its subversive
hair, has been analyzed to death. For my students, the '60s might as
well be the late Pleistocene. But Black Flag is on their T-shirts.
It's not just a logo; it's a living culture. As for my own
sub-generation (I was 18 in 1976, when the first Ramones album came
out), the Clash was our Bob Dylan.</TE>
<TE>   So it's time to write punk history, and folks are. In fact, punks
are writing their own history. "We Got the Neutron Bomb" and "Dance
of Days" are ideal anthropologies: They help us understand a
subculture as its participants understand themselves. Each book is
written by a central participant in the scene with the aid of a
professional writer who was there, and each is fundamentally a
collage of quotes rather than a linear narrative.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-'70s, as rock mutated into art under the aegis of bands
like Yes, a back-to-basics movement swept New York and London and
produced the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. Everyone noticed the
attitude, encapsulated by the Sex Pistols' Johnny Rotten spitting at
audiences. But the music itself was back to basics.</TE>
<TE>   By 1979, New York and London punk was losing momentum and a more
uncompromising and problematic style developed, known as "hardcore."
Centered in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., hardcore
was the most direct possible embodiment of rage and alienation,
inciting fans to violence at shows. Some groups flirted with fascist
and racist rhetoric. Songs were howled or bellowed over rhythm
sections that roared like chain saws.</TE>
<TE>   In "We Got the Neutron Bomb," Marc Spitz traces the L.A. scene
into the hardcore era: It is framed entirely as a dialogue among L.A.
punks, though the dialogues are assembled quotations and not actual
conversations. This method initially irritates but ultimately
beguiles: It crystallizes the collective voice of a diverse
subculture. Brendan Mullen founded and ran the Masque in the trashed
Hollywood Center Building--first a rehearsal space, then a
quasi-legal club and always the center of the punk universe--and his
knowledge underpins the perfect pitch of the quotations, turning them
into a definitive history.</TE>
<TE>   The story starts with glam rock: David Bowie and Iggy Pop and
misfits such as Kim Fowley, who worshiped the glam icons in the early
'70s. It proceeds through the formation of bands such as Fowley's
Runaways (which gave us the great Joan Jett) and then into the
ascension of L.A. punk in bands as diverse as X, the Motels and the
Go-Go's.</TE>
<TE>   One iconic moment is the advent of the Germs in 1979, arguably the
first hardcore band (though the D.C. band Bad Brains was emerging
around the same time). Led by the self-consciously insane and
sexually ambiguous Darby Crash, they rejected musical proficiency and
perhaps even music and tried to perform a spectacle of rage and
ecstasy, including self-mutilation and the destruction of the clubs
in which they played.</TE>
<TE>   "We Got the Neutron Bomb" leaves us as the scene shifts from
Hollywood and a fairly small and tightknit community of musicians to
what one participant calls "Clockwork Orange County": suburban zones
such as Huntington Beach and nearby Long Beach, where truly
screwed-up kids invented the slam dance and stage-diving. Soon the
great L.A. hard-core bands such as Black Flag, Agent Orange and
Circle Jerks were making focused and extreme music.</TE>
<TE>   One thing you've got to give L.A. punks, they had the best names
ever: Hellin Killer, Cliff Hanger, Lee Ving (of the great
faux-fascist band Fear), Tomata du Plenty, Phil S. Teen, Billy Club.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone seemed to be high all the time. Drugs, alcohol and
rampant sex unified the kids but in the end destroyed the unity and
the music. In a fairly typical moment in "We Got the Neutron Bomb,"
Slash Record chief Bob Biggs reports that Darby Crash would shoot up
gutter water when he couldn't get heroin. Crash committed suicide by
drug overdose before he even really found his voice. Like the drugs,
AIDS exacted an awful toll, and by the mid-'80s there was very little
left at all.</TE>
<TE>   That makes the D.C. story all the more moving. As rock critic Mark
Jenkins and ex-scenester Mark Andersen show in detail in "Dance of
Days," harDCore (as the style was called) emerged with a philosophy
called "straight edge": no drinking, no smoking, no promiscuous sex.
The movement was named after a song by Minor Threat and centered on
its singer, Ian MacKaye. Straight edge is perhaps the first and only
authentic ascetic youth movement in American history, and it emerged
in part because the kids at Wilson High in northwest Washington,
D.C., saw their older siblings (that would be me, a member of the
class of 1976 before my expulsion) damaging or killing themselves.
Before long, there were straight edge kids all over the country. The
Boston straight edge was particularly extreme: They would invade bars
and parties and knock beers and cigarettes out of people's hands.</TE>
<TE>   And as the musicians matured from teenagers into artists, the
straight edge philosophy developed into anarchist activism. At the
Dischord record label, which issued and continues to issue important
music outside of the mainstream music industry, MacKaye's band,
Fugazi, still manages itself, books itself and records itself. For
much of its history, Dischord was the music wing of Positive Force, a
loosely knit political collective to which co-author Andersen was
central.</TE>
<TE>   "Dance of Days" emphasizes that (unlike the L.A. scene) harDCore
was relentlessly political, and remains so today. We might say that
politics is to D.C. what decadence is to L.A.: a hobby, an obsession,
the end of all things.</TE>
<TE>   The D.C. scene continues to flourish after 20 years. Grunge bands
were closely connected to D.C. punk. In fact, Nirvana's drummer, Dave
Grohl, who now fronts Foo Fighters, played the '80s, not in Seattle
but in Washington, D.C. punk bands.</TE>
<TE>   And the phrase "straight edge" has entered the collective
consciousness. Used especially by girls, it amounts today to a kind
of declaration of sexual independence.</TE>
<TE>   Punk has triumphed, not only in grunge but in today's top pop rock
bands such as Blink 182, No Doubt and P.O.D., a vindication of the
music, if not the vision, of Mac- Kaye and Crash. There is a thriving
punk world--the Methadones, Bigwig--on independent labels, making
some of the best music around. As did the blues, punk emerged among
members of a particular group to transform pain and rage into art.</TE>
<TE>   If for whatever perverse reason you're trying to figure out the
'80s, forget Reagan and Wall Street: Visit me at art school and
realize that MacKaye and the Masque were and remain far more central
to our generation.</TE>

<DH>GRACEFULLY INSANE: The Rise and Fall of America's  Premier
Mental Hospital, By Alex Beam, PublicAffairs: 288 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW SCULL</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We live in the twilight of the empire of asylumdom. Until two or
three generations ago, we followed the example of our Victorian
forebears, consigning legions of the awkward, the inconvenient and
the impossible to purpose-built museums of madness. Most of them were
vast and straggling outposts of the welfare system, vainly aspiring
to the status of medical institutions; a few smaller and more
plushily appointed, where the most batty and dotty representatives of
what passes for an American aristocracy could be kept discreetly
under wraps.</LD>
<LD>   Nowadays, we have embraced what our Orwellian leaders have dubbed
"community care." The mad and the mopish, the dolorous and the
downcast, the delusional and the demented have been "decarcerated."
Cast out of the institutions where once they were locked away and
instead doped up with the miracle pills of modern psychopharmacology,
they subsist at the margins of civilized society, most of them
repressively tolerated in the most deteriorated sectors of our urban
areas. Meanwhile, bereft of the human flotsam and jetsam that once
provided their raison d'etre, the edifices that once housed the
alienated are in their death throes.</LD>
<TE>   Alex Beam, a columnist for the Boston Globe, has written a
biography of one of these decrepit near-corpses, the McLean Asylum, a
place he dubs "America's premier mental hospital." If McLean has a
claim to preeminence, it is not because it came first (Philadelphia
and New York built their bins some decades sooner, as did colonial
Williamsburg). Nor is it because it was a center of psychiatric
innovation or by some measure "better" than several of its
competitors. To the contrary, it was largely a therapeutic backwater,
notwithstanding its academic affiliation with Harvard Medical School.
It was from its up-market clientele (Boston Brahmins, literary icons
such as Robert Lowell and Sylvia Plath, the mad mathematician and
sometime Nobel prizewinner John Forbes Nash, and, as it began to
spiral downward, spoiled rich kids from the 1960s generation, such as
the singing Taylor brothers, James and Livingston, and their sister
Kate) that the luxuriously appointed asylum, set in grounds designed
by Frederick Law Olmsted, obtained its status and its standing.</TE>
<TE>   Beam makes little of the McLean asylum's 19th century history. He
recalls the founding of the asylum in the late 1810s and briefly
sketches its early history in a Charles Bulfinch-designed building in
Charlestown, Mass., but he fails to mention one of the greatest
ironies of its early years: that it was the poor and working classes
who contributed most generously to the initial funding of the
establishment, relying upon assurances that their needs would be met,
only to be shut out once it became apparent that the rich would not
tolerate confinement of their relations alongside the socially
inferior.</TE>
<TE>   Beam's biography skates lightly over the hospital's youth and
early adulthood, focusing its gaze rather on the last century of the
asylum's life--the period that followed the institution's move from
what had become an area of slaughterhouses and slums to the leafy
Boston suburb of Belmont. There, amid acres of rolling grounds, about
160 patients lived in surroundings that, on the surface at least,
mimicked the country-house lifestyle many of its affluent patrons had
enjoyed prior to their breakdowns.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, the establishment's wealthiest patron was Stanley
McCormick, heir to the McCormick Harvest Machine Co. (later
International Harvester) fortune. McCormick was a one-man gravy train
for the psychiatric profession, despite their collective inability to
do anything for him. In his post-McLean years, a series of shrinks
danced attendance on him. One psychoanalytically inclined gentleman
was paid the princely sum of $150,000 a year (in 1927) to devote his
entire attention to "mad McCormick" (with the usual lack of success),
until he was fired amid the acrimony of an lawsuit launched by the
patient's wife (herself embroiled in endless disputes with Stanley's
blood relatives).</TE>
<TE>   Psychoanalysis appealed to a segment of McLean's clientele, and a
whole succession of patients were subjected to the dubious
ministrations of talk therapists, with generally dismal results. Not
that they were spared assaults from the other weapons in the
psychiatric arsenal. To the contrary, Beam recites a litany of failed
and often frightful therapeutic interventions of a somatic sort
visited upon those who occupied the wards. Being rich and mad, it
turned out, did not spare one the encounter with lobotomy, insulin
coma therapy or a variety of shock therapies, or even with a melange
of the lot concocted by McLean physicians and administered under the
label of "total push therapy."</TE>
<TE>   A journalist by training, Beam wants to tell a good story, and he
prefers interviewing the living to slogging through the archives. So
it is to the events and personalities of the last half century that
he most closely attends. A string of doctors and patients pass before
us, each contributing to a portrait of an institution that once
insisted on a six-week preliminary residence before offering either
diagnosis or prescription for its patients, and that offered for many
of the too wealthy a sheltered sojourn apart from the cares of the
world--a stay that often continued to their deaths.</TE>
<TE>   But the managed-care revolution, and the relentless escalation of
the costs of in-patient care, compounded by the feckless management
styles of some of its leaders, eventually landed McLean in the soup.
Save for the odd celebrity such as Ray Charles (who elected to stay
for some weeks in the hospital to avoid jail for a drug bust), few
could afford its inflated charges. The in-patient population shrank,
the shrinks failed to adjust to the new realities, and the whole
place began to fall apart. The institution's new master plan calls
for selling off much of its 250 acres of rolling grounds for
redevelopment, donating other land to the township as open space (a
bribe to obtain the necessary planning approval), and setting up a
new, small, super-expensive unit, the Pavilion, which for $1,800 a
night will offer its wares to the tiny segment of the population that
can afford such indulgence. It is not certain that even these drastic
moves will allow it to survive.</TE>

<DH>BLACK LIVINGSTONE: A True Tale of Adventure in the
Nineteenth-Century Congo, By Pagan Kennedy, Viking: 238 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN SCHRANK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"No man--you apprehend me?--no man here bears a charmed life." So
says a frustrated agent in Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness."
Considering the genocide that occurred in the Congo at the turn of
the last century, a charmless life does seem like the only option.
But William Sheppard, the "Black Livingstone" of Pagan Kennedy's fine
new biography, possessed just enough charm to make him the exception.
His charm lay in his adaptability; he understood that a multifaceted
image is everything.</LD>
<LD>   "To earn the trust of the Africans, you must become protean, a
shape changer, a man of a thousand faces," Kennedy writes. "You had
to be a black white man." And Sheppard was that: He was an American
black man who had to become a Presbyterian missionary to go to
Africa. The combination of surviving in Jim Crow America and an
education at Hampton and Tuscaloosa Theological Institute had already
forced Sheppard to learn the skills that would help him prosper once
he arrived. He only needed the church to get him there.</LD>
<TE>   Sheppard's adventure begins in 1890 when, at 25, he sails out of
New York with fellow missionary Samuel Lapsley, his priggish, pious
and, most necessarily, white companion. Lapsley is completely taken
in when he meets Belgium's King Leopold, who controlled the Congo.
Kennedy skillfully shows how the "apparent coincidences" that ease
their voyage exist only because of Leopold's evil schemes. In fact,
King Leopold's master plan for the Congo makes him as horrifying a
figure as Hitler or Stalin.</TE>
<TE>   In Africa, Sheppard quickly turns into Mundele Ndom, or the black
white man. Upon his arrival, he forgoes preaching and instead kills
36 hippos to feed the Bateke people, who were in danger of
starvation. While the Christ-like Lapsley succumbs to the harshness
of the interior, Sheppard flourishes. He makes an unprecedented
journey to the secret kingdom of the Kuba. He makes friends with the
Kuba king Kot aMweeky and involuntarily becomes Bope Mekabe, "a
reincarnated member of the Kuba elite."</TE>
<TE>   Sheppard's early life makes up Part 1 of "Black Livingstone." His
is a rollicking adventure. But historical gravity comes in Part 2,
beginning with the hardships endured by Lucy Gannt Sheppard,
William's wife, who accompanied him in the Congo in the mid-1890s.
Though Lucy dreamed that her accommodations in the Congo might be
"the Ladies Home Journal house," she's plagued by difficulties and
heartbreak. Lucy loses two babies to fever and disease. Sheppard
becomes less carefree, though when not with Lucy he lives as
"Sheppate" and takes African mistresses and fathers additional
children.</TE>
<TE>   In Chapter 8, "A Basket of Hands," Kennedy describes a "horrifying
mission" that Sheppard was ordered to take by another missionary,
William Morrison. Sheppard had to find "evidence of atrocities" in
the killing fields created by the Zappo-Zap warriors, who were
employed by King Leopold's Belgians. Sheppard allows Malumba, the
Zappo-Zap leader, to believe that he is Belgian and is, therefore,
his boss. Malumba subsequently shows him evidence of his warrior's
efforts, including a basket of "eighty-one right hands" and "people
with the flesh carved off from the waist down." Sheppard takes
photographs of these horrors with a brand new Kodak box camera.
Again, it's his ability to role-play and put others at ease that
saves his life.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy deftly combines Sheppard's own concise commentary ("I said
very little [to Malumba]" he wrote later. "I thought it a better
policy.") with her own dramatic depictions of horrors comparable in
scope to any genocide of the 20th century. She slowly and
dramatically builds Sheppard's role to show how "mass media and human
rights were inextricably linked." She argues that when Sheppard took
on the Zappo-Zap mission, the idea was without precedent. She writes,
"No one had ever launched an international human rights campaign
before."</TE>
<TE>   Later, the Belgians attempt to bring Sheppard and Morrison to
trial, and Sheppard writes articles that condemn King Leopold's
activities. Mark Twain bases his book, "King Leopold's Soliloquy," on
Sheppard's writing and "mentions the hero by name." And so, "without
meaning to, he [Sheppard] had become one of the world's most
outspoken black critics of white oppression." Kennedy can't avoid
wrestling with Sheppard's politics: When Sheppard is back in America
on lecture tour as the "Black Livingstone," he is sometimes subtle in
his stand against King Leopold and the Belgians, though he is clearly
disgusted with their activities. Sheppard explains his inactivity
this way: "Being a colored man, I would not be understood criticizing
a white government before white people." Through it all, Sheppard
seems to be aware that he must grapple not with his own limitations
but with the limitations of others.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy chronicles Sheppard's life with a near pitch-perfect
combination of sympathy, drama and historical comprehension. She
transforms Sheppard's acute case of changeability into an intense
narrative force. And though she often seems tempted by a hindsight
view of Sheppard's activism, she errs on the side of building an
admirable biography and does not try to make this incredible protean
man transcend the horrible violence and political upheaval of his
times.</TE>

<HD>Ready, Set, Rewind</HD>
<DH>Studios are playing it safe with numerous sequels, prequels
and reworkings of tried-and-true themes.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"What the mass media offers is not popular art but entertainment
which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced
by a new dish."</LD>
<LD>   That's a line from the British poet W.H. Auden. His is not a name
that trips off the tongues of moguls as they dine on Cobb salads at
the Grill, or of rabid development executives hunting down their next
big script. Indeed, Auden's final book of poetry, "Epistle to a
Godson," was published in 1972.</LD>
<LD>   That was the last golden age of Hollywood, when such films as "The
Godfather," "Cabaret" and "What's Up, Doc?" were rolling into
theaters. Imagine what he might have said if he had had to
contemplate a year filled with "Star Wars" 5, "Jason" 10, "Bond" 20,
"Austin Powers" 3, "Lord of the Rings" 2, "Harry Potter" 2, "Men in
Black" 2, "Stuart Little" 2, "Spy Kids" 2, "Santa Clause" 2, and new
installments in the Jack Ryan, "Star Trek" and "Desperado"
franchises. That's not to mention such live-action comic strips as
"Spider-Man," "Constantine,"  "Daredevil" and "Scooby-Doo" (whose
trailer got a big cheer from the audience when I saw "Harry Potter"
1).</LD>
<TE>   Unlike Wall Street and Silicon Valley, the movie business appears
to be percolating along. In 2001, the industry earned a record $8.3
billion. Six films grossed more than $200 million each, five of them
with significant kid appeal. "Family entertainment was king last
year," Columbia Pictures Chairman Amy Pascal notes. "If we learned
anything last year, it's that families like to go to the movies
together, and if you give them good movies, they will go."</TE>
<TE>   Kids will have plenty to see next year. Besides the juggernaut
fantasy sequels, there is such Nickelodeon product as "Clockstoppers"
and "Hey Arnold! The Movie," as well as an Imax prequel to the 1979
"The Black Stallion" a prequel to "Peter Pan," and Disney's "The
Country Bears," which has the dubious distinction of being the first
film derived from a theme park attraction. ("Pirates of the
Caribbean" is coming--this is not a joke.)</TE>
<TE>   Just because box office was up didn't mean, however, that more
people flocked to the pictures. As veteran prognosticator Tom Sherak
of Revolution Studios points out, "The admissions don't change. The
box office goes up because the price of the tickets goes up." Adding
an ominous note, Sherak explains that to get really big grosses, the
studios need to win the hearts and minds not of those who live in New
York or here in L.A., but of the residents of Wichita, Decatur, Omaha
and Rapid City. "The philosophy is if a movie is to be really big, it
works from the middle of the country out. A picture can do well
working on the coast, but to be really big, it needs to be working in
the middle of the country."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, it was a year of unprecedented turmoil behind the scenes
as the studios geared up for a strike that never happened, jamming
pictures into production willy-nilly in the first quarter of the
year. They then sat around for a number of months trying to digest
what they had wrought, until they were sideswiped by the events of
Sept. 11 and sat around for a few more months trying to figure out
how pop culture should respond.</TE>
<TE>   The net result appears to be a collective grasp for the familiar.
It's a year long on marketing concepts, and short on films that can't
be described in 10 words or less, although as ever there are a few
hardy souls beating against the tide of corporatization and the
prevailing assumption that movies are simply widgets that talk.</TE>
<TE>   At least half the films coming appear to be retreads of past hits.
"Rules of Engagement" is recycled into "High Crimes," and "Sleeping
With the Enemy" has morphed into "Enough," now starring J. Lo instead
of Julia Roberts. Eddie Murphy updates "48 Hours" with "Showtime,"
trading in former partner Nick Nolte for new comic superstar Robert
De Niro.</TE>
<TE>   "The Full Monty" has spawned an entire genre--the band of misfits
makes good--that includes "Welcome to Collinwood" ("The Full Monty"
does a heist), "The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest" ("The
Full Monty" goes online) and "Lucky Break" ("The Full Monty" in
jail).</TE>
<TE>   There is also the progeny of "The Sixth Sense," films that combine
thrills and new-age mysticism, such as "Dragonfly," in which Kevin
Costner is contacted by the spirit of his dead wife through the
near-death experiences of her patients, and  "Sin Eater," a Heath
Ledger thriller about an ancient order of priests who can absolve the
guilty of their sins, but, as the promotional material points out,
"the absolution is fatal!"</TE>
<TE>   "I started a genre; I didn't realize it," sighs "Sixth Sense"
writer-director M. Night Shyamalan. "I guess I'm supposed to be
flattered, but it bothers me." This year Shyamalan returns with
"Signs," about a farmer (Mel Gibson) who wakes up one morning to find
his land imprinted with crop circles--perhaps made by aliens. "I've
seen footage of them," Shyamalan says of the phenomena, which have
appeared in several Midwestern states. "It's quite a magical thing to
be inside one of these things, even the ones we made."</TE>
<TE>   Like Shyamalan, others are trying to make films that are not
simply product extensions or prefab insta-movies in which the concept
has been tried five times before and the studio has just added water.
Below is a list of hope, potential beacons of ingenuity that might
keep the brain cells alive during your next trip to the multiplex.
Some of next year's best films will undoubtedly not be on this list,
as they're lurking in the independent netherworld. (Last year at this
time, "In the Bedroom," now a critical darling, was just getting a
distributor.) Others on this list will inevitably fail, but at least
they dared.</TE>
<TE>   Big Directors Who Can Do Whatever They Want</TE>
<TE>   After a three-year hiatus, Martin Scorsese returns with his
long-awaited epic "Gangs of New York," a sprawling tale of a young
Irish immigrant seeking revenge on his father's killer. It's set amid
the racial clashes and draft riots of Civil War-era New York.</TE>
<TE>   For film lovers, this has the highest wanna-see factor. It boasts
a spectacular cast that includes Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio
and Cameron Diaz, lavish sets, and a director who generates cult-like
devotion. For Hollywood cognoscenti, the film's $90-million budget is
more than what any Scorsese film has ever grossed domestically. It
went six weeks over schedule and spawned tales of an epic battle over
length between Miramax honcho Harvey Weinstein and Scorsese, someone
who can actually go mano a mano with Harvey Scissorhands.</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese says he's been fascinated with the period since childhood
and has wanted to make this movie for more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I found the book ['Gangs of New York' by Herbert Asbury] on Jan.
1, 1970, and I read it in one day. It had all the folklore of old New
York, particularly about the Five Points area, and the struggle of
poor people and the underworld of New York, which was very colorful
and very political, and in 1850 and early 1860s how the Irish gangs
would fight the nativist gangs," Scorsese said.</TE>
<TE>   "It made me begin to think how the first wave of immigration was
really a test of what America is supposed to be. [The motto is] 'Give
us your homeless and your poor.' Was America to be open for everyone
in the world or just those who were there [first]? A lot of it was
worked out on the streets of Manhattan."</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese contemporary Steven Spielberg has a trio of films coming:
the 20th anniversary re-release of "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial";
"Catch Me if You Can," starring DiCaprio and Tom Hanks in the true
story of master forger Frank Abagnale Jr., the youngest man ever on
the FBI's most wanted list; and "Minority Report," a film noir set in
the future, starring Tom Cruise as a police detective who uses
psychic technology to arrest murderers before they strike. Problems
ensue when, accused of a future murder, he finds himself victim of
his own scientific methods. Scott Frank and Jon Cohen scripted.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Soderbergh, by contrast, is going ultra-low-tech with "Full
Frontal," a super-experimental quickie shot on digital video and film
during a hectic 19-day period last fall. Scheduled to debut in March,
it is being craftily marketed by Miramax as the unofficial sequel to
1989's "sex, lies, and videotape," which appears to mean the movie
Soderbergh would make if he were going to make "sex, lies, and
videotape" now. Get it? The actors, who include Catherine Keener and
Soderbergh's old partner in crime Julia Roberts, did their own hair
and makeup and shot some of the video themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Literary Properties With Buzz</TE>
<TE>   Here's what insiders are talking up: "About a Boy" with Hugh
Grant; "White Oleander," "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,"
"Possession," "The Hours" and "About Schmidt," which has little of
Louis Begley's original novel but the divine premise of a man--Jack
Nicholson--tooling around America in a rented Winnebago.</TE>
<TE>   Wholesome Films</TE>
<TE>   "Ice Age" might have come too late to save Fox's incipient
animation division, but this computer-generated film, set in
prehistoric times, features a woolly mammoth, a sloth and a squirrel
with a distinctly Wile E. Coyote flair for disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "Pinocchio" boasts the acting and directing services of the joyous
human pinball Roberto Benigni, although some children might be
surprised to find their beloved wooden puppet being played by a grown
man.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, although the Disney stock price is flagging, the mother
ship of family entertainment is reputed to have reversed the slow
degradation of the famed animation machine with "Lilo &amp; Stich," which
features an adorable alien puppy dog-like creature, a ukulele-playing
Hawaiian girl and songs by Elvis Presley.</TE>
<TE>   Disney is also betting on "The Rookie," the true story of a
middle-aged high school baseball coach who tried out for the major
leagues ... and made it. Texan director John Lee Hancock wanted to
make sure "not to embarrass my home state, which is always cartoonish
and caricatured in its presentation. The guys always have on
10-gallon hats and wear suspenders, and I was sick and tired of
that."</TE>
<TE>   Actors Stretching</TE>
<TE>   "The very first day of shooting I had Sam Rockwell standing
completely naked in front of a TV set. That typifies the way the film
is going," says George Clooney from location in Toronto, where he is
making his directorial debut on "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."
It's based on the "unauthorized" autobiography of game-show host
Chuck Barris, creator of "The Dating Game" and "The Gong Show," who
claims to have been a covert CIA assassin with 33 kills on his
record.</TE>
<TE>   Inside wags have already dubbed the film the comic version of "A
Beautiful Mind," but Clooney says, "I choose to believe him because
he's a nice guy and a fairly honorable guy. The things he's willing
to tell about himself aren't very flattering, so it's fun."</TE>
<TE>   Robin Williams, the cuddliest man in show biz, explores inner
darkness as a murderer in "Insomnia," Christopher Nolan's follow-up
to "Memento," and as a creepy, obsessed photo processor in "One Hour
Photo." In the black comedy "Death to Smoochy," he's Rainbow
Randolph, the corrupt ex-star of a children's show out for revenge on
his replacement, goody-two-shoes Smoochy, a pink rhino played by
Edward Norton.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to do an ad that said, 'Everyone wants a movie to take
their children to. This is not the film,' " Williams says of
"Smoochy." "It's got a real edge. It's dark, nasty, funny, which is
great to do with a comedy."</TE>
<TE>   After sitting 2001 out, Adam Sandler returns with three films, a
return to "Wedding Singer" terrain with a remake of Frank Capra's
"Mr. Deeds," the still-untitled Paul Thomas Anderson offbeat romance
in which he plays the owner of a plunger factory who must contend
with a rapacious phone sex operation, and who finds love and harmony
with Emily Watson. Last is "Adam Sandler's 8 Crazy Nights," an
animated comedy in which Sandler plays the three lead parts and sings
five songs. "It's Adam, Adam, Adam all the time," Columbia Pictures'
Pascal says, adding, "I believe in Adam Sandler 100% of the time. I
do."</TE>
<TE>   Wacky and Different</TE>
<TE>   "Had I known it was going to be made, I wouldn't have written it.
It's a sort of unflattering portrait of myself," Charlie Kaufman says
about "Adaptation." It was supposed to be a straight adaptation of
Susan Orlean's best-seller "The Orchid Thief," but the "Being John
Malkovich" scribe, unbeknownst to the studio who hired him, made it a
story about a confused, self-hating screenwriter struggling to write
an adaptation of "The Orchid Thief." Nicolas Cage plays Kaufman as
well as his freeloading twin brother, and Meryl Streep is Orlean.
Spike Jonze directs.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing the same comic insouciance he brought to "The First Wives
Club" and to his literary alter-ego, Libby Gelman-Waxner in Premiere
magazine, writer Paul Rudnick drops a Manhattan heiress into the
world of gangsta rap in the wild romantic comedy "Marci X," starring
Lisa Kudrow and Damon Wayans. "It's a real interracial love story,"
Rudnick says. "That's an area that's been somewhat neglected or only
treated like an NBC white paper or a '60 Minutes' spotlight. It's
wonderful terrain for a romantic comedy to have two really terrific
comic stars going for each other."</TE>
<TE>   A different kind of love story awaits in "Frida," the tale of
Mexican painter Frida Kahlo and her tempestuous relationship with
muralist Diego Rivera. Directed by Julie Taymor, director of "The
Lion King" stage musical, and starring Salma Hayek, it brings Kahlo's
paintings to life with a series of vivid tableaux vivants: "It looks
like a painting, but then you realize it's alive," Taymor says. Hayek
"breathes and moves."</TE>
<TE>   David Fincher was sent the script for "The Panic Room" with a
caveat from his agent that he probably wouldn't like it because it
took place in one house. "I thought it was kind of interesting.
Always a contrarian, that's my mantra," Fincher says. He brings his
stylish touch with suspense to this tale of a young divorcee (Jodie
Foster) and her daughter who are locked in their New York
brownstone's "panic room" during a vicious home invasion.</TE>
<TE>   When You Have More Money Than God</TE>
<TE>   CNN founder Ted Turner is making sure the country gets a big dose
of American history with "Gods and Generals," the big-screen prequel
to the New Line Civil War extravaganza "Gettysburg." Robert Duvall
plays Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and Turner has a small part as
Col. Waller Tazewell Patton and even sings. Some 100,000 Civil War
re-enactors volunteered to play the fighting armies.</TE>
<TE>   "They brought their own weapons and uniforms," Turner says. "We
couldn't have made the movie without them. It would have cost more
than 'Harry Potter.'" As it is, Turner shelled out all $53 million of
the film's cost from his own pocket.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all my money. Every penny. That way nobody can blame me if
it doesn't work."</TE>

<HD>Not-So-Super Heroics</HD>
<DH>How do you make comic-book bravery relevant? 'Spider-Man's'
makers stress their hero's conflicts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The scene: Debris and horror raining down behind them, a well-dressed
couple clutch each other and stumble from the devastated World Trade
Center. They look up to see a famous hero, a man dressed in scarlet
and blue dangling from a rope of webbing. They ask him not for help,
but for an explanation. "Where were you?" "How could you let this
happen?" The hero bows his head and wanders into the billowing dust.</LD>
<LD>   The fleeting encounter at ground zero is not from the upcoming
film "Spider-Man." If it was, it would make the filmmakers both
psychic (the principal filming was completed in the weeks before
Sept. 11) and foolhardy--who, after all, would even consider
incorporating the terrorist attacks in a summer blockbuster designed
as state-of-the-art popcorn escapism? Instead, the scene is from a
recent comic book published to raise money for relief efforts and
also frame the attacks for young readers.</LD>
<LD>   The jolting words and pictures, though, speak to an intriguing
question for the film life of "Spider-Man": How relevant is an
old-fashioned spandex superhero in a somber world where the new
heroes wear firefighter togs and villains appear on CNN?</LD>
<TE>   This question does not elude Sam Raimi, the soft-spoken director
of "Spider-Man," who knows that quite a bit of money and career
capital are invested in making this 1962 comic book creation into a
2002 cinema sensation. Asked if timing and tone are on his side, the
director takes a long moment to consider and then picks his words
with care.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for me to make a grand statement of our society, and
this movie is not that, it's for entertainment, first and foremost.
But you know, 'hero' is such a sacred word right now. We've seen now
what a hero is by watching some among us risk and lose their lives to
help others. We all want to pay tribute to those men and women for
that. But before there were those real heroes, there were these
myths, this fantasy. And it has lessons in it for young people. It
does not compete with the real heroes, nor could it."</TE>
<TE>   The man who wears the mask in the film is actor Tobey Maguire, who
is breaking from his recent history of playing contemplative
outsiders who build walls around themselves ("Cider House Rules,"
"Wonder Boys") to play, well, a contemplative outsider who climbs
walls.</TE>
<TE>   Munching on a vegetarian sausage in a West Hollywood coffee shop,
he shrugs when asked the same question about heroes and timing and
tone. "If anything, I think people will be ready this summer to watch
a good guy in New York who has fun and goes around and beats up the
bad guys. Do superheroes still fit in?" He takes a bite of his
English muffin. "Yeah, I think so."</TE>
<TE>   As long as there have been stories, there have been heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Beowulf, Hercules, the Scarlet Pimpernel and Sherlock Holmes--they
came in varied literary shapes and sizes through the ages, but for
American youth culture, the most accessible and indelible heroes have
been the costumed men of mystery. Superman was first, landing in the
summer of 1938 with his square jaw and promises to fight for truth,
justice and the American way. In a few years, he was there in full
four-color glory hitting Adolf Hitler with haymakers and urging kids
to buy war bonds.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Spider-Man arrived in 1962, though, the hero model was
changing and becoming more complicated, just like the youngsters
buying comic books. "The older heroes were, to me, boring," says Stan
Lee, who co-created Spider-Man with artist Steve Ditko. "I wanted to
do something different and make a hero the readers would feel was
like them, not above them."</TE>
<TE>   In the first issue of the comic book (now worth a small fortune on
the collector's market), Spider-Man is presented as Peter Parker, a
mousy high school student ignored by girls and bullied by football
players. Bitten by a glowing, radioactive spider, Peter discovers he
has become unnaturally strong and agile, and can now cling to
walls--he has literally been imprinted with the attributes of the
arachnid. The quasi-scientific creation of superpowers and the
ensuing illogical decision to parade around in a gaudy, skin-tight
costume made this new hero a fairly garden variety addition to the
comic book world. But it was his problems, not his powers, that made
him a groundbreaking creation. He's usually broke, confused and a
little whiny. He loses fights with the bad guys and his own callow
teen impulses. The cops hate him, the local newspaper rails against
him, and he often wonders why he's risking his life when nobody
understands him.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Superman, that was my first favorite," Raimi says. "But
when I was about 12, Spider-Man was the one that fascinated me.
Unlike Superman, when Spider-Man arrives somewhere, the crowds boo
him, they don't hail him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's mistrusted and misunderstood. He's not from another planet.
He's a kid living in Queens. He's not rich, he's not Bruce Wayne.
He's a bit irresponsible and a bit self-involved. Really, it was a
soap opera, there were all these threads continuing through the story
line."</TE>
<TE>   For Raimi, now 42, and other young readers, Spider-Man's reckless
but heartfelt attempt to do the right things and deal with the
strange physical and emotional changes in his life resonated beside
their adolescent struggles. As cultural commentary too, there was
more to Spider-Man and the other Marvel Comics heroes of the 1960s
than superficial escapades.</TE>
<TE>   Some were bitter and iconoclastic, plagued with self-doubts,
envious of their peers or suspicious of society. They dealt not just
with bad guys, but with bigotry, evil corporations, overzealous
authorities and their own foibles.</TE>
<TE>   One character with the silly-sounding name Silver Surfer spent his
days flying above the nations of the world and walking among its
peoples in disguise. Lonely, he ruminated about the failings of
humanity, and suffered abuse and ostracism for all of his good deeds.
It may be an overstatement to connect these parable-like comic books
to angst of 1960s youth and the era's turmoil, but it must also be
considered that you can tell a lot about a culture by the mythology
it creates for its 12-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an interesting thing to look at," says Joe Quesada, now
editor in chief of Marvel Comics. "The history of the hero-villain
models can be very telling about the times. In the 1950s, for
instance, there was a clear-cut line. There were the black hats and
the white hats. In the 1960s, it was still clear who the good guys
were, but they were more complex. They had Achilles' heels, they had
their share of faults."</TE>
<TE>   That was then, but what about now? Which hero speaks to today's
youth?</TE>
<TE>   Quesada points to popular Marvel character the Punisher, who was
created in the 1970s but remains among the most bankable and most
followed characters in the company's deep trove. The Punisher has no
powers; he just owns more firearms than the military of a small
nation. He was a cop but, a la Serpico, he refused the overtures of
his corrupt compatriots and then watched as his wife and children
were murdered during retaliation by the bad cops. The Punisher
responded by becoming a one-man vigilante death squad, a Charles
Bronson with a black costume and rippling muscles.</TE>
<TE>   "The Punisher is a perfect example," Quesada says. "The readers
are more sophisticated now and exposed to more, and, for a lot of
them, they think his approach is the way to respond to the evil out
there. I think that does reflect something in our society and
culture."</TE>
<TE>   Whether they are bellwethers of contemporary ideals or just
disposable pulp, comic books and their brand of the fantastic have
become staple source material for Hollywood. The "Superman" and
"Batman" film franchises have combined to give the movie industry two
decades of box office heroics, while "The Mask," "Men in Black" and
"Blade" proved that the characters didn't have to be household names
to fly as films.</TE>
<TE>   More projects are in the pipeline, but none is as anticipated as
"Spider-Man." At theaters, the crowd response has often been wildly
enthusiastic to the trailer's footage of the hero's breathtaking
web-swinging and leaping in urban concrete canyons.</TE>
<TE>   "He looks great, just great," muses Raimi, not so much bragging as
marveling at the special-effects capabilities of the day. There may
be relief too in Raimi's voice--the relief of a true believer
protecting treasured property. It's now well-known that Raimi's
mother painted a mural of the superhero on her son's bedroom wall as
a birthday gift when he turned 12, and he has a deep reverence for
the original Lee and Ditko stories. "He was destined to make this
movie," Maguire notes.</TE>
<TE>   Raimi's reverence and David Koepp's screenplay have kept the
film's story foundations extremely close to the comic book origins.
Some of the subtle changes: Peter Parker is now less geeky and more
brooding; the spider that bites him is genetically altered instead of
irradiated; and, in a slightly disturbing change, the webbing he uses
emanates from his body chemistry instead of the wrist-wrapping
contraptions he invented in the comic books.</TE>
<TE>   The axis of the character remains a bitter lesson he learns: "With
great power comes great responsibility." That phrase was used by the
movie's director, star and producer during separate interviews for
this story and, if you check, you'll find it is a pivotal utterance
in the movie's script as well as the final thought on the last page
of Amazing Fantasy No. 15, the first appearance of the character 40
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   If Spider-Man is a "hero of important example" for young people,
as Raimi offers, he is one who comes packaged with driving guilt,
self-loathing and loss. As the story goes: Young Peter first uses his
new powers for personal gain, winning prize money in the wrestling
ring by defeating far larger opponents. Basking in his success one
night, a robbery suspect races by him as a police officer shouts out
for Peter to trip or grab him. The teen balks and tells the cop to do
his own job. Later, Peter suffers a horrible loss: His beloved Uncle
Ben (Cliff Robertson in the film) is murdered by a robber--the same
man Peter had the chance to stop. The youngster is inconsolable but
eventually turns his grief into action, pledging to make up for his
sin.</TE>
<TE>   All of that will be familiar to thousands and thousands of
moviegoers who grew up reading the popular comic book, but it was new
ground for the actor donning the costume. Maguire, 26, had a somewhat
vagabond childhood after his parents split when he was a toddler, and
he says he never read comic books along the way. "I never really got
introduced to comics," he says. "Like a lot of kids, I played a lot
of video games, and I guess you learn about good and evil there, in a
way." He had zero interest initially in playing the superhero, but he
changed his mind after reading Koepp's script and hearing that Raimi
was on board.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire then delved into the comic book history of his character,
reading reprints of the first 50 issues or so of the 1960s-era comic
book. Sitting in the coffee shop on the Sunset Strip, Maguire flipped
through the pages of a hardcover collection of the very earliest
Spider-Man stories, and he gushed about the surprisingly fresh allure
of the story lines that spend as much time with high school angst as
with rooftop battles.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire and company acknowledge that a second Spider-Man film is
practically a given, and it's no secret that Sony would love to weave
Spider-Man into a lucrative franchise, especially with the extensive
rogue's gallery of villains that Ditko rendered so vividly, including
Dr. Octopus (a scientific genius who has long, powerful mechanical
arms grafted to his torso), the Vulture (a bald bad guy with wings)
and Sandman (a thug who can turn his body into the consistency of
sand or the density of rock). The first film's heavy is the Green
Goblin, a high-tech hobgoblin who is secretly Peter's most revered
mentor and father of a good friend.</TE>
<TE>   Played by Willem Dafoe, the Green Goblin creates more internal
conflict for Peter when what seems at first to be a clear and pure
evil is something far murkier.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so cut and dried in the sense that these people are
complicated characters," Maguire says. "The Green Goblin is still
considered the bad guy, the evil guy, but there are redeeming
qualities about him and things that you want to care about him for.
And Spider-Man is not a flawless character. He's not just an
altruistic, perfectly moral superhero. He's a human being that
struggles with his own personal desires against his sacrifice for the
greater good and greater responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Maguire says that the failings and weaknesses of a hero are the
stuff of intriguing stories. Indeed, one of the reasons kryptonite
became such a fundamental part of the Superman stories is the vital
need for some chance that he might actually lose once in a while.
Spider-Man, conversely, suffers setbacks and losses all the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man is trying to pay down his own guilt; that's why he
puts the costume on," Raimi explains. "But he is a hero because he
grows from an irresponsible young man into a responsible young man.
He makes sacrifices for others. He's an icon for kids. He can't
compete with the firefighters we see as heroes now, but he can teach
a kid that one young man named Peter Parker learned and grew into a
hero."</TE>
<TE>   Viewers may find their thoughts might flip for a moment to the
events of Sept. 11 while watching "Spider-Man." That's because, in
the distant background, the World Trade Center remains part of the
skyline of Spider-Man's New York. The towers were featured
prominently in a trailer that was pulled after the attacks, but that
footage was jettisoned, according to producer Laura Ziskin.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not integral to the storytelling," she said. "It was not
that we felt it was inappropriate to have the World Trade Center in
the film.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing was, for us, to have a scene with a helicopter, an
aircraft and the World Trade Center was hard for us to look at. That
was the extent of the concrete impact [of the attacks] on the
project. When you ask if there was something less concrete, anything
that influenced us, that's harder to answer. If there was, I can't
put my finger on it or articulate it. But, in today's context, yes,
some of the good and evil issues are more poignant now. Any story of
a hero, especially one that lives in New York, is a little more
poignant right now."</TE>
<TE>   The offices of Marvel Comics are on East 40th Street in Manhattan.
The business never shut down after the nearby terrorist attacks, but
Quesada said it has been impossible not to reflect on the nuances of
hero manufacturing in the new world disorder. "It does color the
content," he said. "It's just in the back of your mind as you do
these things. I think what 9/11 has done too is rejuvenated the
heroic ideal--I think people are in a new phase in this country,
they're tired of questioning leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "They're looking for heroes again."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, a hunger for heroes and the quickening pulse of
patriotism are understandable responses to the nation's ordeal, but
there is still the issue of real-life dramas making the comic-book
world seem a little too precious even for youngsters. Doesn't a man
climbing walls like a spider seem a little quaint when airplanes are
falling out of the sky? Quesada says not.</TE>
<TE>   "When we did the issue with Spider-Man at the World Trade Center,
you could read it different ways. The superheroes were there and
helping, but you could also read it metaphorically that the message
was, 'We're here always, behind you and in you.' The heroic ideal is
part of us. So I don't think all of this makes superhe- roes quaint.
I think it makes them needed."</TE>

<HD>A Road Paved in Gray</HD>
<DH>A hit man's journey of vengeance held moral complexities
irresistible to Sam Mendes and Tom Hanks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRITTEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Two years ago, a movie with a distinctly ambivalent central character
was the unlikely winner of the Academy Award for best picture.</LD>
<LD>   Was "American Beauty's" Lester Burnham, the character played by
Kevin Spacey, a downtrodden suburban hero, wearied by the shallowness
of his materialistic surroundings, or a sleazy, sardonic creep with
an unhealthy interest in a girlfriend of his teenage daughter?</LD>
<LD>   Director Sam Mendes, in his first movie, kept audiences intrigued
by such questions and did so with style. But he must now surmount a
familiar obstacle: his sophomore film.</LD>
<TE>   At first glance, Mendes' "The Road to Perdition," which is
scheduled to open in July, could hardly be more different from the
contemporary suburban affluence in which "American Beauty" is set. It
takes place in Chicago and the Midwest in the Depression era of the
1930s.</TE>
<TE>   But its story revolves around a character of moral complexity to
rival Lester Burnham's: Michael Sullivan, a hit man who sets out with
his young son on a journey of revenge after members of his family are
murdered.</TE>
<TE>   In his office at the Donmar Warehouse, the small London theater he
has run with remarkable success for the past 10 years, Mendes
discussed his attraction to morally ambivalent lead characters.
"[Michael Sullivan] is not a good-hearted hit man," he said flatly.
"He's a hit man. He's done bad things and also necessary things. He
doesn't explain his actions. As with Kevin Spacey's role in 'American
Beauty,' the audience is asked to judge whether at any given time
this man is doing good or bad. The film flirts with audience's
sympathies in that way. It has no moral absolutes--which is what drew
me to the script."</TE>
<TE>   Mendes has himself added to the sense of paradox about this
dubious central character. "When I read the script, I said I'd like
to pursue it, but I also wanted someone you would never expect to
play [Sullivan]," he said. "Because it's much more interesting to
cast against type."</TE>
<TE>   They don't come much more against type than Tom Hanks, the nearest
thing to an all-around stand-up guy that American movies have
produced since the days of James Stewart and Henry Fonda. Hanks is
best known for playing essentially decent, even heroic characters,
but he leaped at the chance to portray Sullivan, even though he had
wanted a long break from filming after the grueling experience of
shooting "Cast Away."</TE>
<TE>   "You can't be a slave to the familiarity that the audience has
with you," Hanks said, speaking by telephone. "I'm familiar to
people, but I think you have to do something to expand the horizons
of that familiarity. You can't escape the fact that people know you
and have preconceived notions of you, but you have to try and take
people places with you they've never been to before. It's a hard
thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Judging by a two-minute trailer for "The Road to Perdition," it's
clear that Hanks' character is no angel. "This isn't like Tony
Soprano's family, trying to deal with the ethics of whether it's bad
or OK to kill someone," Mendes observed. "[In 'Perdition'] that deal
was done years ago."</TE>
<TE>   The other strong narrative strand in "The Road to Perdition" is
the uneasy relationship between Sullivan and his son, Michael Jr.,
(played by Tyler Hoechlin), who accompanies him on his vengeful
mission. "What isn't clear at first in the story is how much the boy
knows about how his father makes his living," Mendes said, "and then
what happens when he finds out.</TE>
<TE>   "In part, this story is about the secret world your parents
inhabit that you don't have access to. This boy gets access before
he's ready, so then it's about how children have to deal with
violence, and whether the seeing and watching of violence leads you
to become violent yourself. Ultimately, it's about a father saving
his son from his own fate."</TE>
<TE>   Hanks, 45, said he too was intrigued by the story's father-son
motif. "As can happen with small dysfunctional families, where a lot
of things aren't said, one son can be the apple of the father's eye,"
he noted. "And in this story, there's a developing relationship
between the father and son, and you wonder what will happen."</TE>
<TE>   Hanks noted that "Perdition" also features a subtler, surrogate
father-son relationship, between his character and that of his mob
boss, played by Paul Newman. Mendes described Newman's character as
initially benevolent but increasingly sinister.</TE>
<TE>   The film came about after DreamWorks, the studio behind "American
Beauty," sent Mendes a script written by David Self ("Thirteen
Days"). Self had adapted it from a graphic novel by Max Allen
Collins.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a comic book," Mendes said, laughing. "I can't bring myself
to say 'graphic novel.' But it's a serious story. The script is
loosely based on it. The film took a swift diversion from the source
material the minute I got hold of it. And the script needed to be
pared down to its essence. A lot of what I saw in it had the same
kind of nonverbal simplicity of art-house pulp movies like 'Once Upon
a Time in America' and 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.' The story
isn't just about what's said."</TE>
<TE>   Hanks said the script was toned down considerably from its source
material: "The graphic novel was much more pulpy. They call
[Sullivan] 'The Angel,' and he strikes fear into everybody. In the
movie, he is still an enforcer, but his notoriety is soft-pedaled."</TE>
<TE>   Mendes, 36, had expected a long break from movies in the wake of
"American Beauty." He returned to work at the Donmar Warehouse not
actively looking for film projects and started work directing a play
called "To the Green Fields Beyond." (He recently announced that he
will step down as artistic director of the Donmar in November,
although he will retain an office there.)</TE>
<TE>   It was when he was in rehearsals with the play that he agreed to
direct Perdition. This was exactly a year after the September 1999
release of "American Beauty." But once the play was complete, the
film had to be shot in quick time, to be completed before last year's
planned writers' strike.</TE>
<TE>   The production base for "Perdition" was Chicago, but because
Mendes wanted an authentic sense of time and place and as little
computer-generated imagery as possible, shooting was spread out
across far-flung Midwest locations. Much of the action in the story
centers on the Quad Cities region of Illinois and Iowa (The
"perdition" of the title refers not only to damnation and the loss of
one's soul, it is also the name of a fictitious small town in
Michigan that plays a crucial part in the father and son's journey.)</TE>
<TE>   It's likely that "The Road to Perdition" will be one of the year's
most hotly discussed films because of the moral ambivalence at its
core: a guy in a murderous profession who's nevertheless trying his
best to be a responsible father. It's these shades of gray that
Mendes and Hanks have seized upon most eagerly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's odd to be making films in the Hollywood mainstream that
aren't dealing in black-and-white issues," Mendes noted. "First
'American Beauty,' now this."</TE>
<TE>   As a director, Mendes has made his reputation on closely studying
texts and working to reach their emotional core, first with a Donmar
revival of Stephen Sondheim's controversial musical "Assassins,"
later with "Cabaret" and "The Blue Room," starring Nicole Kidman. Of
"American Beauty," he has said, "I thought I was making a much more
whimsical, comic story, kaleidoscopic, almost like a Coen brothers
movie--'The Big Lebowski,' for example. And in the cutting room I
found I was instinctively drawn towards a much more emotional story."</TE>
<TE>   Hanks is even more bullish than Mendes about the absence of
black-and-white figures in "Perdition."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the film has a ring of authenticity to it. It's a genre
movie, by and large, with all the signposts you'd expect: There's
bootlegging, it's set in the Depression era. But it avoids the
standard narratives. It looks at gray areas. There's a substantial
amount of paradox in the story.</TE>
<TE>   "It stays within the confines of an expensive, mainstream studio
picture, but Sam is a renegade," Hanks continues. "He has a bit of
the anarchist in him. With him directing, you get not to do the
standard things."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Hanks believes the good-bad dichotomy at the heart of
"Perdition" is what underpins the story: "Otherwise, it's just about
the retribution of a bad guy planning revenge. Without that
ambivalence, you're just dealing with the primary colors of
movie-making. When you're trying to hold a mirror up to nature, deep
down the audience knows that people sometimes get away with evil.</TE>
<TE>   "At times, movies can be like a standard morality play, a bracing
tonic. But there are also times when the audience is dying for
another view, about the paradox of being alive."</TE>

<HD>An Architect's Steely Resolve</HD>
<DH>After pondering the interaction of humankind and nature,
Barton Myers answers with statements in metal. Some are practical,
some aesthetic, as seen in '3 Steel Houses.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles architect Barton Myers is better known for designing
large public buildings than private houses. He is the brain behind
the award-winning Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, completed
in 1993--a flexible facility with movable floors and seats, which
allows for multiple uses, and reconfiguration from a flat exhibition
hall into a 1,850-seat arena or theater with 900, 1,450 or 1,963
seats. The work of Barton Myers Associates can also be seen in
Beverly Hills, where the firm was responsible for major renovations
at 9350 Center Drive and the nearby Ice House office building.</LD>
<LD>   On the other side of the country, Myers designed Newark, N.J.'s
$180-million New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which opened its
doors in 1997 and serves as home for the New Jersey Symphony.</LD>
<LD>   In 1997, New York Times architecture critic Herbert Muschamp gave
the arts center, across the street from Military Park and a block
from the Passaic River, a mixed review. He praised the center's
2,750-seat Prudential Hall, the largest of its two theaters, as
"breathtakingly glamorous," and the 514-seat Victoria Theatre as a
"smoky amethyst of a room." But he trashed the lobby areas, calling
their eclectic mix of patterned carpet, glass, wood and copper "a
mess."</LD>
<TE>   Because he's known primarily for public buildings, Myers, 67, is
particularly excited by the opportunity to show a more intimate side
of his work in "3 Steel Houses," an exhibition of drawings, models
and photos showcasing three of Myers' steel-framed residences.
Organized by the University Art Museum of UC Santa Barbara to mark
the recent donation of the Myers archive to the museum's Architecture
and Design Collection, the show at UCLA's Perloff Gallery runs
through Feb. 8. The exhibition includes his own home and studio in
Toro Canyon, Montecito, near Santa Barbara. Myers and his wife,
Vicki, moved into the house in 1998. The compound is made up of three
pavilions built on a slope, with Myers' studio at the top, the main
residence in the middle, and a guest house and garage at the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   The house is notable for retractable window-walls that can open
the rooms to the idyllic Santa Barbara climate, as well as for its
equally practical metal panels that can roll down to secure the
buildings from the ever-present threat of brush fires.</TE>
<TE>   Also included in the exhibition are two homes in Canada, including
another Myers family residence in Yorkville, Toronto--this one not on
40 rustic acres, but with its ultra-contemporary facade sandwiched
between square homes of sedate, traditional brick.</TE>
<TE>   A few days before the exhibition was to open, Myers, a professor
in UCLA's department of architecture and urban design, reflected on
the reasons a member of the general public might join campus
architecture students in discovering a modest display detailing the
birth of three houses.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is no show more interesting to people than houses,"
Myers says during a conversation in the firm's new Westwood Village
offices--another recent renovation at 1025 Westwood Blvd., all
concrete, glass and steel, with an enormous curved ceiling made of
wood, reminiscent of an airplane hangar. "You can see the earliest
sketches to the working drawings to how it is actually built."</TE>
<TE>   In November, the firm moved into the space, which doesn't look
lived-in yet. Before the interview, Myers' archivist, Kelly Robinson,
mentions that to give the ceiling its stressed look, the wood was
blasted with walnut shells. Tiny bits of shell continue to surprise
the staff by raining down into the cavernous communal working
space--most recently, into Robinson's coffee.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us have a pretty emotional and passionate feeling about
the way we want to live," says Myers, seated at a glass table in the
rear of the space; for the moment, no nutshells appear to be falling.
"That's why there are so many shelter magazines. Here is another idea
about shelter, another lifestyle that might be different from yours,
another way of living.</TE>
<TE>   "In my house [in Montecito], it's about the way one begins to
engage nature," he continues. "The ability to be able to open and
close houses, move in and out, is the California dream, and obviously
inspired by the Japanese--but you also have to deal with the question
of fire. In the Canadian climate, you live in a more introverted way;
you bring light inside and try to think about a way to get through
those long, gray months without the California sun.</TE>
<TE>   "And then, I think, it's also about seeing new technologies, the
promise of new technologies in housing. Luckily, when I got started I
was doing a lot of very large projects, when a lot of my American
contemporaries were doing houses--so I haven't done a lot of them.
I've always done them as interesting experiments."</TE>
<TE>   How does Myers define a "steel house"? "I use the idea that the
predominant statement is steel," he says. "We use a lot of steel in
housing, but most of it is hidden, in seismic reinforcing--these are
houses in which the major architectural element is steel.</TE>
<TE>   "Glass has been with us a long time, it goes back thousands of
years ... but the idea of the glass house, the glass box, is
relatively familiar. Steel is relatively new in domestic
situations--you are used to seeing it in the commercial world, but
not in the domestic world.</TE>
<TE>   "The first really great steel houses only begin in the 1920s; then
we had the Case Study houses in the 1950s. There are probably only
200 interesting steel houses in the world, so it is relatively
avant-garde.</TE>
<TE>   "Vincent Scully, the great [architecture] historian at Yale, once
said that you can't really talk about houses as architecture unless
they do three things. One, they have to have an interesting idea
about space. Two, they have to say something about the time they were
built in. And three, they have to have prototypical implications.
These three steel houses have helped me kind of advance prototypical
ideas; we try things out that, hopefully, other people can learn
from, and use."</TE>
<TE>   One of his favorite elements, Myers says, is the use of
off-the-shelf materials. "None of these things are made as stock that
you can go pick them off the shelf, but most of them are standard
pieces that are prefabricated for you," Myers says. He waves at the
back entrance of the company work space: "These aluminum doors behind
you are all made up of common parts, but they make those to your
dimensions--they can be wider, or higher, and are all made of things
that are readily available in the industry. They don't involve new
fabrication or invention."</TE>
<TE>   Myers is an unlikely champion for the architectural avant-garde.
He is originally from Norfolk, Va., an area steeped in architectural
tradition. The Myers family occupied the same home, a brick Colonial
near the center of town, for six generations, from 1791 to 1932; the
home survives today as a museum.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, Myers attended the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis,
Md., and became a jet pilot in the U.S. Air Force. He later attended
the University of Pennsylvania (1964-66), before launching his
architectural career in Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was in Canada, they were always very polite, but I was
always an American," Myers says with a laugh. "And when I came to Los
Angeles, all the California architects thought I was Canadian. I
think I'm finally being accepted as a Southern California architect."</TE>
<TE>   Myers is less accepting of Southern California architecture--not
the buildings themselves, but the area's failure to take advantage of
the concepts of interconnection and community, ignoring opportunities
for renovation and infilling (creating more dense neighborhoods by
building between existing structures) as alternatives to sprawling
growth. This is particularly true, he says, of such architectural
landmarks as Brentwood's Getty Center, the new Kodak Theatre in
Hollywood and the yet-to-be-completed Our Lady of Angels Cathedral
and Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We always seem to repeat the same kinds of mistakes in Los
Angeles. I think the cardinal [Roger M. Mahony] made a great mistake;
he shouldn't have abandoned the old cathedral," he says, referring to
St. Vibiana's Cathedral, several blocks away, which was damaged in
the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The decision was made to build a new
cathedral, rather than renovate the old cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   "He abandoned a hugely important cultural and historical piece; he
leaves a critical part of Los Angeles that needed a catalytic shot in
the arm, and moves to an isolated freeway location that doesn't
benefit the community, doesn't generate activity around it," Myers
continues. "That's hundreds of millions of dollars spent that doesn't
leverage hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "The Getty is another building with exactly the same issue. They
decide they want to be the 'people's museum,' then pick a location at
the top of a mountain. Not that the Getty isn't doing wonderful
things, but it could have leveraged a whole lot more. And Disney Hall
will be the same; it's an isolated object. That's the disappointment
of Los Angeles; we haven't been able to build the connections the way
we should have."</TE>

<DH>The latest 'Star Wars' installment seeks to show how a good
kid can transform into a force of darkness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leave it to Yoda, "Star Wars" resident sage, to articulate the moral
descent experienced by villainous Darth Vader. "Fear leads to anger,
anger to hate, hate to suffering."</LD>
<LD>   "That's the path," says "Star Wars" creator George Lucas. "Without
that, there wouldn't be any prequel, because there wouldn't be any
story to tell."</LD>
<LD>   Lucas, creator of the world's most popular film franchise--nearly
$1.5 billion domestic box office and counting--is speaking from the
Bay Area, where he's about to catch a plane for London to oversee
musical scoring for "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones." The
picture, fifth in the "Star Wars" saga, opens May 16.</LD>
<TE>   But back to Yoda. His pronouncement on the roots of evil occurs
during "Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace," the 1999 "Star
Wars" episode that presents the once and future Darth as a spunky,
tow-haired tyke named Anakin Skywalker. He's Jedi material, argue his
mentors, but Yoda senses fear in the boy.</TE>
<TE>   Just how prescient was Yoda? Jump ahead in the story--and back in
real time--to the original 1977 "Star Wars," wherein Anakin, renamed
Darth Vader, serves as a fearsome henchman for a wicked emperor.
Vader tortures Princess Leia, helps blow up an entire planet and
crosses light sabers with freedom-loving rebels.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980), he packs Han Solo into a
frozen keg of carbonite, chops off Luke Skywalker's hand, then
reveals that he is father to the wounded Luke. Darth wreaks more
havoc in "Return of the Jedi" (1983), insisting to Luke that he's
incorrigible before finally redeeming himself by throwing his wicked
boss into a black hole.</TE>
<TE>   But who was Darth Vader before he hid his face behind a shadowy
visor? To answer that question, Lucas needed to take a look at the
man in black back when he was a golden child named Anakin Skywalker.
Lucas says of the first "Star Wars" prequel, "'Phantom Menace' was
done really to determine that Anakin was a good person, good heart,
nice kid. We're not talking here about an evil little monster
child--we're talking about this great kid just like we all start out
as, or [we] think we start out as."</TE>
<TE>   In "Episode II," Lucas says, "the issue then becomes, what is it
in Anakin's personality that makes him turn bad? What is his flaw? He
has a couple. The groundwork is put forward in this movie much more
clearly."</TE>
<TE>   "Attack of the Clones" was shot in 61 days using the
high-definition digital video format Lucas believes will one day
become the industry standard. Principal photography in Australia,
Italy, Tunisia and Spain wrapped a year ago last fall. For the past
16 months, Lucas and his company Industrial Light &amp; Magic have been
working on special effects for the film, budgeted at about $110
million.</TE>
<TE>   As with the previous "Star War" movies, "Episode II" plot twists
have been kept under tight wraps. The director's production company,
Lucasfilm, has pressured Web fans to remove "spoilers" and
unauthorized script snippets from their Web sites and Lucas isn't
about to divulge anything--yet.</TE>
<TE>   But this much is known: Ewan McGregor returns from "Phantom
Menace" as Anakin's mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Natalie Portman is also
back, but she's given up her crown as Queen Amidala of Naboo to
become Senator Padme. Anakin has grown into a headstrong 19-year-old
Jedi-in-training who falls in love with Padme while serving as
bodyguard during her trans-galactic travels. His loyalties are torn
because the Jedi oath forbids romantic love.</TE>
<TE>   Hayden Christensen plays Anakin. The 20-year-old Canadian beat out
more than 400 actors considered for the role. Since completing work
on "Episode II," Christensen has been nominated for a Golden Globe
award for his work in "Life as a House." Speaking from Toronto, his
hometown, Christensen said, "Like Anakin, we all have to make
choices, following instinct, reasoning and our heart. We're
continually being presented with influences, sometimes very opposing
ones, that motivate us and affect our decisions. Hopefully we choose
wisely."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when a character chooses rashly, it makes for a far
more interesting yarn. Lucas says, "What brought me back to finish
the whole thing off was the question of why, and how, Darth Vader
became evil. The whole reason for going back and doing the back story
on 'Star Wars' is that there is an evolution from this very good
person, very kind person, very loving person into something that one
would describe as evil."</TE>
<TE>   Post-Sept. 11, any effort to explore the impulse toward evil takes
on heightened relevance. How is it, for instance, that a kid named
John Walker Lindh from a middle-class San Francisco family would grow
up to become a Taliban soldier?</TE>
<TE>   Lucas says that's not his domain. "'Star Wars' deals on a much
more general level with age-old issues relating to fear, the
unwillingness to let go of things. Out of that comes jealousy, and
anger, and wanting power. So 'Episode II' has to do with greed,
power, jealousy and fear, and doesn't really get into specifics of
how you might relate it to what's going on today.</TE>
<TE>   "This stuff was written 25 years ago, so however relevant it is
now is based on issues that have been around a long, long time," says
Lucas, who spent two years in the early '70s researching mythology
and religion before he sketched out an outline for the entire "Star
Wars" odyssey. (Lucas created the basic story for each "Star Wars"
film. He wrote the original "Star Wars" by himself, then delegated
"The Empire Strikes Back" screenplay to Leigh Brackett and Lawrence
Kasdan. Lucas co-wrote "Return of the Jedi" with Kasdan, wrote
"Phantom Menace" on his own, and co-wrote "Attack of the Clones" with
Jonathan Hales.)</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to have this mythological footing because I was basing
the films on the idea that the Force has two sides, the good side,
the evil side, and they both need to be there. Most religions are
built on that, whether it's called yin and yang, God and the
devil--everything is built on the push-pull tension created by two
sides of the equation. Right from the very beginning, that was the
key issue in 'Star Wars.'"</TE>
<TE>   In "Attack of the Clones" and continuing through the yet-untitled
"Episode III" prequel to be filmed in 2005, Anakin will be getting
worse before he gets better. "As evil begins to take over, it pushes
the Force out of balance," Lucas says. "It's easier to succumb to
evil than it is to be a hero and try to work things through on the
good side. Evil is inherently more powerful--it doesn't have the
burden of worrying about other people."</TE>
<TE>   Lucas hopes his "Star Wars" tale, when completed, will simply
portray on epic scale what ordinary mortals deal with on a daily
basis.</TE>
<TE>   "What Luke sees in Darth Vader at the end of 'Return of the Jedi'
is something that I thought was worth understanding: the idea that
Darth actually was a very good person," Lucas says. "Except he's
slightly more powerful than other people and when you get into that
situation, your ability to do evil is much easier to come by.</TE>
<TE>   "But the issues Darth struggles with as he grows older are the
same issues that everybody struggles with, the fact that sometimes
they don't consider the consequences of what they're doing because
it's not expedient."</TE>

<LD>Challenged to justify his dark and depressing plays, John
Stripling--I mean Steppling--delivered this devastating riposte:
"Just turn on the news, and see the carnage and suffering" ("All
Bite, Wherever He Is," by Don Shirley, Jan. 13).</LD>
<LD>   "Just turn on the news"--why didn't I think of that? A complete,
reasoned, unbiased, accurate and penetrating analysis of world events
from dedicated anchorpeople is right here in my living
room--free--courtesy of innumerable generous, fair and open-minded
corporate sponsors.</LD>
<LD>   Gosh, I feel so stupid! Life is depressing, and I could have known
it all along if only I'd had enough sense to watch TV. Steppling's
pithy, succinct "Just turn on the news" may well eclipse Nancy
Reagan's immortal "Just say no."</LD>

<HD>In Search of Divine Ambiguities</HD>
<DH>A director eliminates complex sets to emphasize characters'
gray areas in Opera Pacific's 'Don Giovanni.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For director Thor Steingraber, the essence of "Don
Giovanni"--Mozart's opera about an irresistible libertine, the women
he seduces and his ultimate comeuppance--is what can't be pinned
down.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of 'Don Giovanni' is about a certain divine ambiguity in
almost all the characters and their relationship to this man,"
Steingraber said during a recent break in rehearsals at Opera
Pacific, which is presenting the work this week at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center.</LD>
<LD>   "Many questions are not answered explicitly by [librettist]
Lorenzo da Ponte and Mozart. That ambiguity is useful for stage
directors. If one is really going to present something that is
intriguing and filled with dramatic tension, I suspect one would
engage those divine ambiguities."</LD>
<TE>   Divine, literally, because Giovanni is called to justice from
beyond the grave by the man he kills in the opening scene (while
trying to seduce the man's daughter). Between these two points,
various characters attempt to reveal or discover the truth about
Giovanni, and encounter the limits of their own codes of honor.</TE>
<TE>   Steingraber tries to focus these issues by staging "Don Giovanni"
on one unit set, paring the opera "to the essential visuals." It was
created to his specifications by Riccardo Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   "One could divide 'Giovanni' into many scenes, minimally nine or
10, but also [as many as] 20," Steingraber said. "So often 'Giovanni'
becomes an opera about scene changes. I've sat through many such
productions.</TE>
<TE>   "But very little of it is about place. It's about character and
interaction. I wanted to focus on the narrative, and to aid the flow
and pacing and the impact of the piece by never having to pause more
than a few moments in moving from one scene to another."</TE>
<TE>   Lighting and period costumes (by David C. Woolard, based on 18th
century silhouettes) help define the changes.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a scene-by-scene progression of the costumes, which help
tell the story in their own way, but not in a way the audience
becomes aware of," Steingraber said.</TE>
<TE>   The production, which received mixed reviews at its premiere, has
four partners--Pittsburgh Opera, which gave the premiere in October;
Opera Pacific; New York City Opera, which gets it after the Costa
Mesa run; and Tulsa Opera, which inherits it last.</TE>
<TE>   "We are playing every note of every set piece," Steingraber said.
"There are two minor cuts in the recits, [narrative], maybe a
minute's worth, standard cuts that I've never heard performed.</TE>
<TE>   "We are doing both Ottavio arias, both Elvira arias. We are doing
the epilogue. It has to be done. Ultimately, the opera is a comedy if
you're taking the classic definition. It has a good ending for all
the characters but one. Even with Giovanni, it's an ambiguous ending.
He doesn't just die. Nothing is left as a corpse on the stage. It's
something more theatrical than that. That's why it's so important to
use the epilogue."</TE>
<TE>   These days, Steingraber, 35, spends virtually all his directing
career in opera. Local audiences have seen his productions of
Bellini's "The Capulets and the Montagues" (1999) and Rossini's
"Cinderella" (2000) at Los Angeles Opera. But he didn't start out as
an opera director.</TE>
<TE>   "My formative years were spent studying music and theater
separately," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up in Chicago and went to Indiana University, where he
majored in theater and psychology. But since childhood, he also had
been studying piano and voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Having left the university and getting my start in a career of
theatrical direction, I realized that my training in music could be
wedded with theater into one pursuit, which was opera directing."</TE>
<TE>   His first opera was also one by Mozart--"Cosi fan tutte" for
Indianapolis Opera and Opera Memphis in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had to tell one anecdote about that production, it's that
one critic said, '"Cosi" is a comedy. It must be funny. This wasn't
funny at all.' The second critic said, 'The audience was laughing so
hard, you missed many key moments. It's a shame there was hilarity
all evening.' So how much humor was in the production?</TE>
<TE>   "This production has fewer laughs than some because of the focus.
It's all about one thing--the focus on character, their hopes and
situations and interactions. Hopefully we are engaged in the
characters enough to find genuine humor.</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing about 'Don Giovanni' is, as someone once said, if
it's done well, we can see ourselves in every single character. Don
Ottavio, who wants to do the honorable thing. Giovanni, who has a
lust for life and perhaps a fear of mortality. Leporello, as the
abused person who can't get [himself] out of a bad situation."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of abused people who can't get themselves out of bad
situations, how does he feel about the common belief that this has
become the age of the opera director, not necessarily to the
betterment of opera?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm uncomfortable with the phrase because it sounds like there's
been a coup," he said. "I don't think that's the truth. Directors are
taking their place at the table or being allowed to work as equal
collaborators. I appreciate the prevailing attitude that directors
are stepping to the fore. I don't like the implication that there is
a hierarchy."</TE>

<HD>Linkin Park Tests a New 'Hybrid' Theory: Remixing the CD's
Rap-Rock</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Linkin Park must have done something right with its debut album,
"Hybrid Theory." With 4.8 million copies sold in the U.S. in 2001,
the Los Angeles band's rock-rap collection was the year's biggest hit
and now has total sales of more than 5.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   But the best new artist Grammy nominee is giving the "Hybrid"
material a complete make-over. Enlisting a variety of hip-hop,
industrial and dance music DJs and producers, the group is assembling
a remix version of the album, due in March or April. The idea isn't
just to offer some new spins on familiar songs, but to give them
entirely different sounds.</LD>
<LD>   "We are trying our best to take it as far in a sample-driven basis
as we can without compromising the songs," says group MC Mike
Shinoda. "I want to basically do a complete reinterpretation of the
album with the same intensity, but with as little rock references as
possible."</LD>
<TE>   Big followers of hip-hop and techno, the band's members recruited
some of their favorite figures to work on the tracks. Shinoda says
they turned down offers from some star-level artists in favor of more
underground talent, leaning toward darker, heavier sounds.</TE>
<TE>   Among the best-known people involved are KutMasta Kurt, Evidence
(of Dilated Peoples), the Crystal Method working with Ryu from Styles
of Beyond, and Jay Gordon of the industrial-rock band Orgy. Shinoda
is handling the remix of "Crawling," which is likely to draw the most
attention since it features a new guest vocal by Staind's Aaron
Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' appearance notwithstanding, Shinoda says the album is not
being put together with the idea of another big hit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not even planning to release any singles," he says. "We
don't want radio necessarily to pick this up. We're doing it for our
fans, people who have a lot of different music in their CD
collections. We want them to know they can look to us to mix
different things together. We've always told people about all the
things we listen to and play, but don't usually get to share that
with them."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, it's a different matter with plans for the next
new album, for which the band is currently writing songs with hopes
for a release before Christmas. But Shinoda says commercial aims
won't inhibit creative growth.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of musicianship in the new songs," he says. "It's
more complex music in an understandable package. And I want to take
it up a step as far as the depth of the lyrics."</TE>
<TE>   BREAKING THE MOULD: Bob Mould, ex-leader of punk band Husker Du,
took a couple of years off from music and went to work in 1999 as a
writer for World Championship Wrestling's TV shows, of which he was a
longtime fan.</TE>
<TE>   After WCW went under in 2000, Mould returned his focus to music,
but he didn't want to wrestle with the record business, having been
through several label contracts in his career. So rather than sign a
conventional deal, he's become the first artist to join Aimee Mann
and Michael Penn in their independent United Musicians coalition.
Through an arrangement the coalition has with the RED distribution
firm, Mould plans to release three albums between March and September
on his Granary Music label.</TE>
<TE>   The first, "Modulate," introduces dense electronic textures to
Mould's melodic rock. The second, "Long Playing Grooves," will be an
all-electronic set released under the alias LoudBomb. "Body of Song"
will be an intimate acoustic album.</TE>
<TE>   "I sort of watched the entertainment business systematically take
music apart, strip away the value and meaning of it," Mould says.
"I'm not getting better looking, not getting any younger. I'm not
going to appeal to 10-year-olds. So I don't have a place in what
remains of the traditional music business."</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly the kind of artist United Musicians was created
for, following Mann's release of her "Bachelor No. 2" in 2000 after
Interscope Records let her go. The album sold 176,000 copies--too few
to satisfy a major label, but a healthy, profitable figure for an
indie effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob is great--the right kind of artist to do this," says Mann and
Penn's manager, Michael Hausman, who set up and runs United
Musicians. "He's very experienced, has a strong following and has
been doing this for more than 20 years. In this day and age, the way
the labels operate with this kind of artist, our argument is you're
better off on your own."</TE>
<TE>   Mould will return to the road in March, a venture that will seem
easy compared with life in the wrestling world. "I was helping write
four hours of live TV every week and helping direct behind the
curtain," he says. "It was five days a week of flying--I'd get on the
Learjet in Reno or wherever we were doing the show, we'd make a pit
stop for fuel in Kansas and then back to Atlanta [WCW's
headquarters], getting three hours sleep before having to write more
TV.</TE>
<TE>   "It was harder than punk rock, actually."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Korn's Jonathan Davis has written score music and
five songs for the movie "Queen of the Damned" and will provide the
singing voice for the vampire Lestat. But because of Korn's Epic
Records contract limiting work he can do for other labels, Davis'
voice won't be heard on the soundtrack album, due Feb.22 from Warner
Bros. Records. Instead, Disturbed's Dave Dramin, Static-X's Wayne
Static and Linkin Park's Chester Bennington have filled in on three
songs, with the remaining two still to be completed.... With drummer
Taylor Hawkins publicly acknowledging that drugs caused his medical
crisis in Europe last summer, the Foo Fighters will play a benefit
for the Musicians Assistance Program on Feb. 7 at the House of Blues
in Anaheim. Tickets go on sale Monday.... Magnetic Fields, whose "69
Love Songs" was a 2000 critics' favorite, has become the latest
rock-oriented act to sign to Nonesuch Records, which has deals with
Randy Newman and Wilco.... Dave Matthews' ATO Records label, which
helped David Gray rise from journeyman to star, will try the same
trick with Patty Griffin, who had two respected but poor-selling
albums on A&amp;M. Her new "1000 Kisses" is due from ATO on April 9.
Matthews and Griffin met taping an "Austin City Limits" a few years
ago.</TE>

<HD>Are These Actual Barriers to Drama?</HD>
<DH>Outside East West Players, LAPD anti-terrorist barricades
add resonance to a show but may have hurt company fortunes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>Times Theater Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A joke going around East West Players is that the pioneering Asian
American theater company will stage a site-specific production of
"Les Miserables" on the street outside its theater in downtown L.A.'s
Little Tokyo.</LD>
<LD>   Erecting that musical's famous barricades would be no problem. On
Oct. 5, the day the United States began bombing Afghanistan, the Los
Angeles Police Department placed two large concrete barriers at each
end of the block in front of the theater, complete with checkpoints
that restrict the flow of traffic.</LD>
<LD>   The move was in response to the possibility that terrorists might
attack Parker Center and other police headquarters buildings, the
back entrances of which face East West across Judge John Aiso Street.</LD>
<TE>   No one at the theater has any idea when the barricades will come
down. They may be permanent; an LAPD spokesman, Lt. Horace Frank,
said he expects the barriers to "be up for the rest of time."
They'll almost certainly stay up during the run of East West's next
production, Philip Kan Gotanda's "The Sisters Matsumoto," which opens
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Sisters Matsumoto" is set in the aftermath of the internment of
Japanese Americans in remote camps during World War II, as a family
returns home to California's Central Valley. East West artistic
director Tim Dang hopes Gotanda's play will have particular resonance
right now, "with all the talk about Arab Americans facing wartime
racial profiling."</TE>
<TE>   The play might also carry special meaning in this venue, which was
a church that served as a registration center for the camps during
World War II. Interned Japanese Americans stored belongings in the
basement and returned to retrieve them.</TE>
<TE>   It's even possible that the images of police activity outside the
theater might enhance the feeling of being in the regimented wartime
world that serves as the prelude to the story in the play.</TE>
<TE>   Dang learned about the barricades the morning they were put in
place in a phone call from the production manager for "Red," which
was playing at the theater at the time. When Dang arrived around
noon, he found officers at the checkpoint barring non-police vehicles
from passing through.</TE>
<TE>   Actors and other production personnel as well as audience members
could enter the block only on foot--after they found an alternative
to their normal parking arrangements, which involve entering a lot
just north of East West's theater, through an entrance off Judge John
Aiso Street.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because of the availability of street parking on Sundays,
the Oct. 5 matinee was delayed by only 20 minutes. But Dang
immediately began phoning and faxing LAPD officials, requesting
permission for East West employees and patrons to drive through the
checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, most theatergoers have been allowed to pass through,
but East West officials have heard reports of some who were denied
entrance--including two committee members who arrived on a recent
weekday to help plan the theater's 36th anniversary gala.</TE>
<TE>   They've also heard reports of others who simply turned their cars
around at the checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   "The barricades reinforce a sense of gloom and tension," said
Daniel Mayeda, co-president of East West's board. He said most of the
subscribers will find their way to the shows, but he fears they may
hesitate to recommend productions to friends.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand," Mayeda added, "we're the safest theater in
L.A.; no other theater is behind police barricades."</TE>
<TE>   Company officials believe the barricades have exacerbated the
effects of the economic recession on the company's financial health.</TE>
<TE>   For the current fiscal year, which began in July, East West had
already planned to trim its budget by about 10%, from more than $1.3
million in the previous year to $1.2 million, in response to the
slowing economy.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Dang selected a five-actor musical revue for this
year's late spring show, "The World Goes Round," instead of a bigger
musical, like last year's "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Forum."</TE>
<TE>   Still, in the wake of Sept. 11 and the barricades, much of the
company's financial picture is worse than expected. Season
subscriptions have fallen from 1,100 to about 1,000, instead of
rising to the projected 1,300.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Red," the first production of the season, received
reviews as good as any in East West history, ticket sales were 23%
lower than projections, and the no-show rate for subscribers was
higher than ever. Theater officials blamed post-Sept. 11 malaise and
the barricades. Revenue from advertising in the program and in
newsletters and sales of promotional items have also fallen, as has
corporate and foundation support.</TE>
<TE>   The only silver lining is in the area of private contributions.
Last month, the company received its largest single contribution ever
from an individual. The donor requested anonymity, and the company
won't reveal the amount beyond six figures, but it and other gifts
were big enough to boost the level of giving by individuals to 87%
above projections for the year.</TE>
<TE>   The company's debt stands at about $92,000--down from $170,000 a
year ago--thanks to the private donations.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the shortfall in earned income, East West has taken
several actions to cut back expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Over the holidays, the company moved its offices from rented
quarters at the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center, two
blocks away, to a former storage and dressing room on the fourth
floor of the Union Center for the Arts, the city-owned building that
houses the company's theater on the second floor.</TE>
<TE>   The city's Community Redevelopment Agency is paying the expenses
of building walls in the space to make it into more of an office and
to muffle noise from a nearby generator. Most of the items that had
been stored there were moved to the company's existing warehouse and
rehearsal space in an industrial zone on the east side of downtown
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The moves will save $30,000 a year in rent, and managing director
Al Choy noted the added convenience of consolidating operations in
two locations instead of three.</TE>
<TE>   However, the move also has its drawbacks--the amount of office
space has shrunk from 2,000 square feet to about 750. The theater's
board, which used to meet in a boardroom, met Monday in the new,
cluttered office--"an eye-opener for some of them," Choy said.
Revenue-producing classes that are scheduled to begin in February
have not yet found a new home.</TE>
<TE>   The set for "Sisters Matsumoto" has also been affected by
cost-cutting. The script calls for the two-story interior of a
Victorian house, and such a set was built for the play's previous
productions elsewhere. At East West, the set will be a blond-wood
platform costing about $2,000, in comparison with the estimated
$10,000 that a Victorian house set might have cost. "It's more
metaphorical, less representational," Dang said. He added that the
production's director, Chay Yew, "is very spare in his stagings, so
it's great that he's directing for us right now."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking by phone from San Francisco, playwright Gotanda said such
revisions are fine with him. "I'm interested in looking at it
differently," he said. Although his stage directions ask characters
to go to the second story of the house, and this set won't have a
second story, he said Yew should "throw out stage directions like
that."</TE>
<TE>   East West is also economizing with a hiring freeze, effective last
October. The number of full-time staff has decreased from nine to
seven, supplemented by four part-timers and volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the barricades, the company's leaders hope some of
the confusion for would-be theatergoers will be alleviated in time
for "Sisters Matsumoto." They've met with city officials, and the
city has agreed to pay for street signage that makes it clear that
businesses on Judge John Aiso Street are open and welcoming
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Dang said city officials also have assured East West that officers
at the checkpoints will allow drivers with business on the block to
pass through the barriers. The city channeled several million dollars
in federal block grants to the renovation of the Union Center for the
Arts, Mayeda said, so he believes the city will want to protect that
investment. East West also raised $1.5 million for the renovation
effort.</TE>
<TE>   Union Center has two much smaller tenants: the nonprofit gallery
L.A. Artcore, which has similarly suffered from the barricades, said
executive director Lydia Takeshita, and the nonprofit media arts
organization Visual Communications. That group's operations manager,
Amy Kato, said her group isn't as reliant on foot traffic as the
others, but added that "people feel apprehensive" when they arrive
for meetings.</TE>
<TE>   When East West moved to Union Center in 1998, after spending
decades in a 99-seat theater in a somewhat seedy part of east
Hollywood, "we thought that being next to a parking lot and the
Police Department would be a big plus," Dang said. "Other than
artistic issues, parking and security are two of the main factors
that audiences mention most."</TE>
<TE>   "We've weathered crisis after crisis," Mayeda said, "so we'll get
through this. The artists themselves have contributed money. They've
been very helpful."</TE>
<TE>   "I tell the artists it's like a situation out of 'Les
Miserables,'" Choy said. "You just have to brave the barricades."</TE>

<LD>Presenting 2002, the year in movies. Daunted? This year, in addition
to the stories outlined below, we have attempted to organize our
complete list of the year's movies into a more manageable overview.
Our usual mammoth chronological list was inevitably subject to studio
rescheduling whims.</LD>
<LD>   Within six categories--action, animation, comedy, drama, foreign,
thrillers--we've arranged the list in a way we hope makes it a little
easier to absorb.</LD>
<LD>   The realm of High Anticipation may include films with a
pedigree--director Sam Mendes' first picture since "American Beauty,"
for example--or some that Calendar editors and reporters believe will
be worth investigating. Similarly but less certainly, films under
Curiosity Factor piqued our interest in some way, whether it was the
subject matter, star, director, writer or combination thereof.</LD>
<TE>   An umbrella for titles from actors, directors and writers on whom
studios--and fans--have come to rely for sure bets, the Familiar Zone
is the home for some sequels and material about which we have a
reasonably good idea of what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   Fun to Contemplate includes, among other things, guilty pleasures
or titles that for some reason made us giggle, gasp or groan.</TE>
<TE>   Animated movies, you'll notice, are not otherwise categorized
because there are only 10.</TE>
<TE>   You may disagree with some of our designations but we hope they
will engage you. For better or worse, here are the films slated for
release for the remainder of 2002.</TE>

<HD>The Feelings Aren't Mutual</HD>
<DH>Cozy talk from the managers of our retirement funds can't
make us feel better about our losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Given our recent numbers, you may wonder why we're still so
confident."</LD>
<LD>   As a matter of fact, the question occurs to me just now. That and
the old Beatles' song "I'm a Loser."</LD>
<LD>   I've just received an annual report from one of America's largest
mutual fund companies. This is the season when such statements arrive
in the mail, charting the progress of millions of our precious nest
eggs--complete with the insider scoop on investment strategies.</LD>
<TE>   First thing I noticed is that Sir Isaac Newton was wrong about
gravity. You may recall, he postulated that two falling objects will
arrive in the dirt at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   "For the 12-month period ended Oct. 31, 2001, ____ fund declined
43.42%," the report begins, "significantly under-performing its
benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Index, which lost 24.83%."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the face of dear Ben Franklin on a C-note has been reduced
to one each, Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln and George Washington,
plus pocket change. Perhaps we should reconsider Ben's old ditty
about the value of a penny saved if $100 becomes $56.58.</TE>
<TE>   These big mutual funds are supposed to shoulder the investment
work for the millions of us who have other tasks to do. It is in
diversified, brand-name outfits like this fund that George W. Bush
and Daniel Patrick Moynihan want us to entrust not just our 401(k)
but our Social Security too for a better future.</TE>
<TE>   Because they manage our collective billions in retirement dollars,
these funds can command journeyman talent there on Wall Street, or so
we're told.</TE>
<TE>   In this progress report, some 15 portfolio managers guide us into
the rabbit hole, writing down their thoughts "about performance."</TE>
<TE>   As I read along, some follow-up questions came to mind:</TE>
<TE>   Portfolio manager: "I've been known to follow something called the
20% rule: If a stock falls 20%, it's time to sell."</TE>
<TE>   So how did you lose 43%?</TE>
<TE>   "I have not allowed panic or headlines to dictate my investment
decisions. Bottom line is that we do our homework."</TE>
<TE>   Oh really? Whose idea was it to invest $154 million in Enron?</TE>
<TE>   "Through this difficulty, we have never wavered."</TE>
<TE>   You held on to Enron?</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, our conviction in the majority of our owned companies
has strengthened, especially at these lower valuation levels."</TE>
<TE>   So you're waiting for the chance to buy more Enron?</TE>
<TE>   "Our companies and their management teams have certainly been
tested, and I am very satisfied with their progress to date."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Kenneth Lay and his gang did quite well for themselves,
didn't they?</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, we are our toughest critics."</TE>
<TE>   Would you believe me if I said we didn't believe you?</TE>
<TE>   "It's times like these when you have to take another hard look at
every company in your fund whose valuation has been taken to a lower
level."</TE>
<TE>   Is bonehead English now an elective in college?</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to ask yourself, who are you hiring when you
invest in a mutual fund?"</TE>
<TE>   If not the Three Stooges, then who?</TE>
<TE>   "You'll never hear a prediction of 'when' from me; it's the
'where' that we're spending time on."</TE>
<TE>   Us too. Where did the money go?</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm finding is that, oftentimes, the entire franchise isn't
worth what the market is paying for it today. It's worth more."</TE>
<TE>   To whom?</TE>
<TE>   Portfolio manager No. 1: "Virtually all our companies are actively
working toward lowering their cost structures."</TE>
<TE>   Portfolio manager No. 2: "The way I see it, it's only a matter of
time before this money finds its way into consumer spending
patterns."</TE>
<TE>   Does anyone there know the name of Joseph Heller's most famous
book?</TE>
<TE>   "While some of our companies suffered as a result of poor
execution in a difficult economy, our ongoing research suggests that
many of our companies fell victim to reactionary selling."</TE>
<TE>   Perchance is this what is meant by the phrase, "lose-lose"?</TE>
<TE>   "In either case, our investment strategy remains unchanged."</TE>
<TE>   OK, if green isn't your favorite color, what is?</TE>
<TE>   "We invest our own money in ____ funds, so we share your
disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   Does anyone remember what all the king's horses and all the king's
men couldn't do for Humpty Dumpty?</TE>

<LD>We are the co-presidents of the Amnesty International branch at
Milken Community High School in Los Angeles, and after reading
"Amnesty's New Cause" (by Dana Calvo, Jan. 6), we felt we had to
respond.</LD>
<LD>   The article discussed how the youth of America "seemed to care
more about Napster than the plight of women and children smothered by
the Taliban."</LD>
<LD>   Our high school chapter has more than 50 members out of the
roughly 500 students at our school, and we are deeply committed to
the cause of human rights. Every Wednesday during lunch, we use
Urgent Action appeals from the Amnesty Web site to write letters to
world leaders demanding the release of specific prisoners.</LD>
<TE>   Last year we wrote to President Vicente Fox of Mexico on behalf of
two imprisoned Mexican environmentalists, and this year they were
freed.</TE>
<TE>   It's stories like that which keep our members coming back and
spark the interest of other teenagers who realize they can truly
affect foreign policy.</TE>

<LD>While I agree in spirit with Jeff Cooper (Calendar Letters, Dec. 30)
complaining about having to sit through commercial messages at the
movies, he's being a bit disingenuous.</LD>
<LD>   Has he been to a major sports venue such as Staples Center lately?
Fans are bombarded with ads over the PA system, on the giant video
screens, and even (at Kings games) on the boards and the ice. Plus,
tickets and concessions cost much more than a night at the movies.</LD>
<LD>   The reality is that constant exposure to advertising is a fact of
modern life. At least the ads stop once the movie starts--unless you
count product placements.</LD>

<HD>Not So Quick, Mr. Penn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was perplexed to read that Sean Penn wants to burn all the old
films ("Don't Get Him Started," by Rachel Abramowitz, Jan. 6). He
recently participated in the UCLA Film and Television Archive's "The
Movie That Inspired Me" series, choosing John Cassavetes' "Minnie and
Moskowitz."</LD>
<LD>   Although we have restored two well-known Cassavetes
films--"Husbands" and "Shadows," which are screening at the 2002
Sundance Film Festival--we didn't have this lesser-known title in our
collection. After scouring the other major U.S. archives for a
presentable 35-millimeter print, we finally tracked one down at the
British Film Institute. That evening we were able to screen a
beautiful print.</LD>
<LD>   If this film had not been carefully preserved and archived, Mr.
Penn's choice would not have been available. Also, it would never be
available in a 35mm version to inspire further generations of
filmmakers.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps Mr. Penn should put the matches back in his pocket.</TE>

<TE>   Not since Jodie Foster told the Los Angeles Times Magazine some
years back that when she sees an injured bird she wants to "kick it"
have I read such self-absorbed, pretentious drivel pour from the
mouth of a Hollywood actor, as it did in the Sean Penn interview.</TE>
<TE>   I've never understood the reputation Penn has gained. His
technique seems to involve the artifice of appearing internally
tortured and/or ponderous so as to appear interesting, but it is
really just throwing up emotional sand to distract the viewer rather
than to create something that actually informs a performance.</TE>
<TE>   As for Penn's opinions about how terrible American films are, he
comes across as a self-appointed elitist who can't even clearly
articulate why he feels the films are so bad.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Filmmaker Aaron Landy (Calendar Letters, Jan. 6) finds it
"disheartening that Turan has crowned 'The Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring' as his No. 1 film of the year." I find it
disheartening that a "filmmaker" is so blinded by his paranoia over
corporate hegemony that he can't recognize a special movie when he
sees one.</LD>
<LD>   I'm as anti-hype as they come, but dismissing "Fellowship" as
"dreck" is both patronizing and disingenuous. In an era when studios
often feel the need to pander to the MTV audience, there's not a
single winking reference to modern tastes in the film. It's blessedly
irony-free. It features stellar performances by first-rate actors. It
takes the source material seriously--there's reverence for J.R.R.
Tolkien's work in every frame. Is it perfect? Perhaps not, but even
those critics who've found fault with "Fellowship" have applauded its
ambition and execution.</LD>
<LD>   Movies offer a forum for a wide range of artistic expression. Some
films illuminate the human condition, others try to transport the
viewer to an alternative reality. "Fellowship" is a sterling example
of the latter--it's the best fantasy film to come down the pike in
ages. It could have been precisely what Landy accuses it of being;
the true miracle here is that it avoided those potential pitfalls.</LD>
<TE>   If Landy has a grudge against that particular genre, he should
come out and say it. In the end, that would be more intellectually
honest than launching into a rant against the evils inherent in
commercialism.</TE>

<LD>In Stephen Farber's cynical piece on the White House's call for more
movies that express "American values" to aid in combating terrorism,
he unaccountably leaps to the conclusion that Karl Rove wants
Hollywood to produce more "gung-ho war movies" that show Americans as
somehow uniquely courageous and self-sacrificing ("In Search of a
Truly American Film," Jan. 6). He correctly notes that Americans do
not hold a monopoly on bravery or community spirit (as if that is in
dispute).</LD>
<LD>   So what recent films illustrate uniquely American values? "In the
Bedroom," for one, according to Farber. He claims that it "makes a
persuasive and terrifying case for the notion that vigilantism is an
irrepressible American impulse." How? Well, for one thing, after the
protagonists do their dirty work, the director "makes a point of
focusing on the American flag." No wonder this film is up for so many
awards.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not sure why Farber took pains to argue that courage and other
admirable attributes are universal, but not the impulse to take the
law into one's hands. One might say Osama bin Laden and other
terrorists around the world have made a more "persuasive" case that
extra-legal violence is far from a uniquely American impulse.</LD>

<LD>   BAD RELIGION</LD>
<LD>   "The Process of Belief"</LD>
<TE>   Epitaph</TE>
<TE>   God--however you choose (or not) to define that term--bless Bad
Religion. In an era when too many demand unquestioning loyalty to the
status quo, the veteran L.A. band provides a by turns muscular,
melodic and melancholy guide to challenging the norm and making your
own rules.</TE>
<TE>   OK, right--that's pretty much what these guys have been doing
throughout their 20-year recording career. But they've got a bit more
spring in their step on "Process" (due in stores Tuesday), perhaps
because of the first appearance of original guitarist-songwriter
Brett Gurewitz since 1994's "Stranger Than Fiction," or maybe because
the group, which moved to Atlantic Records that same year, has
returned to Gurewitz's fiercely indie Epitaph label.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking partly as if addressing a select few who can understand
the message, and partly as if anyone who really listens can get it,
the band tears through 14 tracks in 36 minutes. Guitars mesh with
pell-mell assurance as the players veer from the singsong one-two
punk of "Supersonic" and "Destined for Nothing" to the breathless
tirades "Prove It" and "Materialist" to the angular anthem "Epiphany"
and the goth-pop ballad "Broken."</TE>
<TE>   "You might not think there's any wisdom in a ... punk rock song,"
taunts the environmentally minded "Kyoto Now!" Au contraire,
messieurs. There is quite a bit. Bad Religion plays Thursday, Friday
and Saturday at West Hollywood's Whisky, Roxy, and Key Club,
respectively.</TE>

<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   ELBOW</TE>
<TE>   "Asleep in the Back"</TE>
<TE>   V2</TE>
<TE>   Romance is thriving in England, at least among a new generation of
rock bands. Like Coldplay, Travis, Doves and Starsailor, the young
men of Manchester-based Elbow tap the spirit of classic romantic
poets as they moon over unattainable women but still brave gantlets
of emotional batterings to pursue them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be the corpse in your bathtub/Useless/I'll be as deaf as a
post/If you hold me like a newborn," sings a hopelessly smitten Guy
Garvey in "Newborn," a centerpiece on this debut album (in stores
Tuesday).</TE>
<TE>   The quintet cradles its yearning in music so hypnotically graceful
and magnetically powerful that the offerings are as compelling as
they are naively sincere. Elbow may not prove to be the most
commercially successful of the new romantics--the songs are more
about atmosphere and texture than about pop hooks--but at this stage
it may well be the best.</TE>
<TE>   From the first notes of opener "Any Day Now," with its haunting,
pulsing vocal arrangement and waves of guitars and keyboards, it's
clear this is a band with imagination and ambition.</TE>
<TE>   There are times that "Asleep in the Back" (which is a finalist for
Britain's Mercury Music Prize after it was released there last year)
recalls U2's feeling its creative oats in the mid-1980s.</TE>

<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   WILLIE NELSON</TE>
<TE>   "The Great Divide"</TE>
<TE>   Lost Highway</TE>
<TE>   Pop fans could be rightfully suspicious of yet another batch of
all-star duets between the veteran country outlaw and various rock,
pop and country partners, this time including Rob Thomas, Brian
McKnight, Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt, Lee Ann Womack--even Kid Rock.</TE>
<TE>   Don't be.</TE>
<TE>   This is Nelson's most ambitious and consistently rewarding album
in years. It exhibits a level of commitment rarely apparent in recent
albums that, however musically engaging, have often sounded tossed
together.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson sounds utterly comfortable with the ultra-contemporary
production by Matt Serletic (Matchbox Twenty, Santana). Still, even
production this captivating can carry only so far, and songs by
several outside writers, including Thomas, Serletic and Bernie
Taupin, allow Nelson to ruminate articulately on the toll that time
can take on the heart, the body and the spirit.</TE>
<TE>   There's an elegiac sweep to several tracks: the Nelson-Jackie King
title tune, in which the singer refuses to pronounce a relationship
dead; "This Face," an unflinching self-appraisal that's neither vain
nor self-pitying; and the album-closing duet with Raitt, "You
Remain," a haunting expression of loss.</TE>
<TE>   In "Last Stand in Open Country," his duet with Kid Rock saluting
mavericks young and old, Nelson, who at 68 would seem to have nothing
left to prove, nonetheless sings, "I'm always looking for something
to prove." Obviously he means it, and here he proves it. He plays
Feb. 8 at the Grove in Anaheim and Feb. 9 at Universal Amphitheatre.</TE>

<TE>   "Eban &amp; Charley" soundtrack</TE>
<TE>   Merge</TE>
<TE>   He's made records as Magnetic Fields, the 6ths, Future Bible
Heroes and Gothic Archies, but until now Stephin Merritt has never
released one under his name. The occasion is songs and score for an
independent film about the relationship of a young man and a teenage
boy, and the assignment taps the more abstract aspects of a musician
who's been hailed as the true genius of contemporary American pop
songwriting.</TE>
<TE>   The album (in stores Tuesday) clocks in at barely more than 30
minutes, and seven of them are taken up by the sounds of a rainstorm.
There are also new Merritt songs, all of them legit, if in some cases
mere miniatures. "Poppyland" is a grand adventure in synthetic pop
textures, "Summer Day" has a melancholy Merseybeat feel, and "Maria
Maria Maria" evokes Cohen and Dylan, with the droopy-voiced bard as
soulful as he is doleful.</TE>

<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** KRS-One and the Temple of Hiphop, "Spiritually Minded,"
KOCH/In the Paint. On his 10th album, the Bronx rap pioneer makes God
and redemption the thrust of his sometimes bombastic platform. "Take
Your Time" pleads with women to respect themselves, while elsewhere
the former Boogie Down Productions frontman blasts hip-hop performers
and powers that be for continuing to foist off empty messages on
impressionable fans. Despite occasional tepid production, KRS-One
gives the hip-hop industry a much-needed self-check.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   *** The Streetwalkin' Cheetahs, "Guitars, Guns &amp; Gold," Triple X.
Other than the newly recorded, folk-grungy title tune, this
collection spotlights past points on the eternally rebellious L.A.
punk band's map (with bonus enhanced-CD video!). Despite the changing
lineup and the varying sound quality, these hard-to-find selections
are coherent in their breakneck pacing, brash guitars and cranky
righteousness. Along with the muscular new-waver "Generator,"
highlights include leader Frank Meyer and original bassist Dino
Everett dueting on a previously unreleased version of X's "Los
Angeles" and a frenzied live take on Iron Maiden's "Sanctuary." Rawk!</TE>

<DH>Madlib's funhouse creations have won a notable following.
But rap stardom isn't his goal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing among the schoolchildren and tourists gawking at the
glassed-in sea life at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, a
man in beige pants and a matching turban studies all manner of coral
and kelp with his hands clasped behind his back.</LD>
<LD>   Otis Jackson Jr., who lives just a few blocks away and frequents
the facility, could be mistaken for a professor of marine biology or
perhaps a grad student. He's enraptured by the exhibit featuring
toxic fish and checks out a school of circling anchovies.</LD>
<LD>   But what Jackson is really here to see are the sea dragons. He
remembers them well from his last trip to the aquarium, when he had
partaken in a little "mind-alteration," and they really threw him for
a loop.</LD>
<TE>   "Check them out," Jackson says in a honeyed whisper as he points
at the garish, monstrous-looking fish. "Man, remember those sea
monkeys from the comic books? These look like what I always thought
sea monkeys should look like!"</TE>
<TE>   Of such whimsical observations does Jackson--who goes by the name
Madlib and made his breakthrough record under the moniker
Quasimoto--concoct some of the most imaginative, structurally complex
and flat-out hilarious hip-hop of the moment. The Oxnard native's
musical universe is a funhouse of the mind, hosted by an MC with
multiple personalities and an arsenal of self-made field recordings,
movie dialogue, comedy records and jazz samples.</TE>
<TE>   The goal for Jackson, 28, is not rap superstardom, but the freedom
to record whatever he wants, when he wants. "I didn't get in this to
make a lot of money," he says. "I could do what the industry does--it
would actually be easier than what I do now--but my brain and heart
won't let me. As long as I'm living decent, then I'm cool."</TE>
<TE>   "The Unseen," the 2000 release that Jackson recorded as Quasimoto,
packs countless sounds and ideas into 24 dense hip-hop constructs.
The pace is leisurely and trippy--Jackson's Quasimoto character raps
in a high, reedy voice that sounds as if it's been dipped in
helium--but the musical invention is restless and relentless. Jazzy
grooves collide with comedy shtick, as Madlib/Quasimoto weaves a
vivid slice-of-life urban tableau.</TE>
<TE>   After going virtually unnoticed after its initial release, "The
Unseen" picked up fans by word-of-mouth, and Spin magazine declared
it one of the best overlooked albums of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "Madlib is one of the most refreshing people out there in terms of
musical selection and taste," says rapper Q-Tip, the former A Tribe
Called Quest member who, along with the Roots, Limp Bizkit and DJ
Shadow, is an avid fan. "His approach is just a breath of fresh air.
I like how vulnerable he allows himself to be in this age of
super-rappers."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's latest release, "Angles Without Edges," which he
recorded under the name Yesterday's New Quintet, is a screaming
U-turn from "The Unseen's" dada-hop. Jackson, who has no formal
musical education, plays bass, vibes and Fender Rhodes piano on the
instrumental album, a loving homage to the jazz giants he reveres.</TE>
<TE>   "When Otis first approached me about making a jazz album, he
didn't own any instruments," says Chris Manak, owner of Jackson's
L.A.-based label, Stones Throw. "Instead of an advance, I bought him
a bunch of instruments, and he just taught himself to play
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his musical fecundity and the approbation of an
underground hip-hop community that regards him as a visionary,
Jackson is self-effacing to a fault. He originally recorded "The
Unseen" without any intention of distributing it, and only a tiny
percentage of his massive recorded output has seen the light of day.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to put out 'The Unseen' because I thought I would
be criticized," says Jackson, one eye on a clutch of frisky sea
otters. "I thought everyone would think the sped-up vocals were a
gimmick. I had to be convinced to put it out."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is astonishingly prolific. He has two more Quasimoto
records in the can, as well as 16 Yesterday's New Quintet
albums--that's 320 tracks--waiting for Stones Throw to either release
or not, as the case may be.</TE>
<TE>   "With each album he wants to challenge himself," says Manak, an
acclaimed DJ who records under the nom de scratch Peanut Butter Wolf.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in our studios eight to 10 hours a day recording, and it's
hard to keep up with him. But my label is open to doing anything he
wants."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's musical path was almost preordained. His father, Otis
Sr., was an R&amp;B singer in the '60s and '70s who recorded a number of
records with the great arranger H.B. Barnum. His mother, Senesca
Jackson, was the elder Otis' main songwriter and backup singer, and
her brother is the great jazz trumpeter Jon Faddis.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how I got interested in the recording studio, just going
with them when they were recording," says Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Reared in Oxnard, a town that was plagued by gang violence,
Jackson kept to himself and made primitive mix tapes in his bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of thugs out there, and I really didn't fit in,"
says Jackson, who dug into Public Enemy and Beastie Boys records, as
well as his grandparents' huge jazz collection. "There were a certain
amount of people that were down with me, and we would just sit in the
room and make music."</TE>
<TE>   Among those buddies were his high school friends Jack Brown and
Romeo Jimenez. In 1993, the three made a single under the name
Lootpack and managed to get a copy of it to rapper King Tee, who was
producing the L.A. rap group Tha Alkoholiks. Tee liked what he heard
and hired Lootpack to contribute a track for the band's album "21 and
Over." Lootpack's debut album, "Soundpieces: Da Antidote!," was
released by Stones Throw in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Manak had heard the Lootpack single on a college radio station in
San Francisco and tracked the band down.</TE>
<TE>   "After the Lootpack album came out, Otis got a lot of calls from
DJs trying to find out what gear he used," Manak says. "What's
amazing is that he uses an SP1200 [sampler],  which is a 10-year-old
machine that has only a few seconds of sample time. It's a very
low-tech machine, but Otis has mastered it."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's docket is full for the coming year. He has recently
recorded album tributes to Stevie Wonder and George Duke. Blue Note
Records has asked him to put together a remix album of old jazz
tracks from the label's vaults, and Jackson is also thinking about
working with outside singers. Lootpack may end its hiatus and release
an album on Stones Throw this year, and there's more Quasimoto music
to record too. Stardom, if it ever comes, would be a nice perk, but
it's certainly not a priority.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think about it," Jackson says of fame. "Whatever fits,
fits."</TE>

<LD>You know how you're zipping down a two-lane road admiring the
countryside and suddenly here comes a truck--a rather large
truck--that blasts past with a car-rocking THRUMP that makes a
teenage passenger say, "Cool!"? Well, planet Earth had one of those
close encounters the other day with a very large, gray galactic rock,
and most of us remain clueless.</LD>
<LD>   While we're down here obsessing about important stuff like
football playoffs, Sen. Joseph Lieberman's Afghanistan trip and
mounting LAX parking fees, a rock the size of two Rose Bowls blew
across our planet's bow at 68,000 miles an hour. This lifeless chunk
of primordial refuse has been tumbling around the sun on its own
wobbly orbit every 1,321 Earth days since the solar system was formed
4.5 billion years ago. And we just now nearly met up with it.</LD>
<LD>   This encounter didn't merit 15 seconds of network fame because it
was 510,000 miles away--twice the moon's distance, but a very near
miss in cosmic terms. Earth itself moves through 18.9 miles of space
every second (66,500 miles an hour), never transiting the same spot
twice. Change Earth's position a tad and a good bit of Europe could
be gone today, or a colossal splash would have gained the attention
of countless coastal cities.</LD>
<TE>   Now, here's the real catch: No one on Earth saw this stony rogue
coming. Not until the day after Christmas when an automated NASA
telescope in Maui detected the approaching asteroid's faint movement
and alerted the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Near Earth Objects Office
in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Named 2001 YB5, the rock joins thousands of tracked space objects,
564 of them over a kilometer across. Hundreds more mammoths remain
out there unknown. Not that advance notice would help; there's
currently no defense for asteroid collisions, not even a Bruce
Willis. And now the Tora Bora caves are gone too.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, there will another fly-by of a gigantic rock, when
4660 Nereus blows through the neighborhood. Being 2.7 million miles
away, it'll be ignored too. Back to movie stars.</TE>

<LD>Consider the map below a sharp tack on a sleepy electorate's easy
chair. What it says is this: If secessionists have their way, almost
50% of Los Angeles residents reading this editorial may arise one
morning no longer able to call themselves Angelenos. Better to wake
up now.</LD>
<LD>   A measure to turn the San Fernando Valley into a city unto itself
looks almost certain to go before voters in November. But that's not
all. The commission overseeing the secession process seems intent on
adding to the same ballot proposals to turn parts of the harbor area
and Hollywood into cities.</LD>
<LD>   The commission kept alive the harbor area proposal, earlier deemed
financially shaky, by telling a private consulting firm to add
cost-cutting alternatives to its final study. It ordered an
accelerated analysis of the Hollywood proposal, filed much later than
the other two, so that all three would be on the same timetable.</LD>
<TE>   A secession measure has to win more than 50% of the vote in both
the proposed new municipality and citywide. Having three different
proposals on the ballot would boost each one's chances. If that
tactic leads to passage, it will affect all Angelenos, no matter
where in Los Angeles they live. The day after the election, Valley,
harbor area and Hollywood residents would find themselves Valleyites,
Harborians and Hollywoodenos, with no civic connection to Los
Angeles, which would no longer be the second-largest city in the
United States. Indeed, if the Valley (1.4 million residents and 224
square miles), the harbor area (147,000 residents, 35 square miles)
and Hollywood (209,000 residents, 18 square miles) broke off, Los
Angeles would lose 1.7 million people and 277 square miles, 46% of
its population and 59% of its land area. In other words, those who
live in the tattered remains would suddenly be in a city half what it
had been and, presumably, suffering a commensurate loss of statewide,
national and international clout.</TE>
<TE>   To secession advocates, of course, smaller is better, even if
"small" wouldn't describe either a deconstructed Los Angeles or a new
Valley city that would still be bigger than Boston and San Francisco
combined. We have argued against a breakup, both out of civic pride
and because of the complications and uncertainties such a division
would entail for both the new and remaining cities. But that's an
argument for another day. What's important now is for Angelenos to
decide whether four cities are necessarily better than one, whether
each would be better or worse off than before, whether disentangling
a diverse, vibrant city is worth the costs.</TE>
<TE>   Still ahead are state audits of the consultant's reports and
another round of public hearings. The commission has until summer to
officially decide which proposals to put on the November ballot. But
now is the time for Angelenos to join in the debate, to see that this
plan is not just about forming a new city but about dismantling Los
Angeles itself.</TE>
<TE>   Angelenos who have seen secession movements wax and wane since the
1970s say it will never happen--one more reason to hit the snooze
button and roll over. Don't.</TE>

<HD>Jet Still Flying High With Readers After 50 Years</HD>
<DH>Media: By sticking to its original mission of spotlighting
black achievements, the pocket-size magazine has remained profitable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HERBERT G. McCANN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>When Jet magazine first appeared in 1951, its profiles of black
achievers countered negative images of blacks in mainstream media and
inspired support for the civil rights movement.</LD>
<LD>   "One day, the world will say that Jet magazine was one of the
great victories of black folks," comedian and activist Dick Gregory
said. "Historians will be able to get back issues of Jet and Ebony
magazine and see what happened during the civil rights movement."</LD>
<LD>   More than 50 years later, Jet founder John H. Johnson said the
pocket-size magazine is holding fast to his original idea:
spotlighting black achievements and reporting national and
international events of importance to the black community.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel good that we've survived when so many competitors have
come and gone," said Johnson, who at 83 remains chief executive of
the publishing company bearing his name. "There have been many
attempts to copy [the magazine]. We worked hard and did a better job
of covering the news."</TE>
<TE>   Jet's first cover featured the wife of boxer Sugar Ray Robinson
wearing a mink. In addition to articles on the anti-colonial movement
in Nigeria and Ralph Bunche winning the Nobel Peace Prize, it
featured Edna Robinson's list of ways other black women could get a
mink--her facetious pointers included getting a cheating husband to
buy one as a peace offering and raising the animals themselves.</TE>
<TE>   That combination of the whimsical and the serious is a formula Jet
has followed faithfully.</TE>
<TE>   The weekly was at its most grave when covering blacks' battle for
equal rights. Its reporting of the August 1955 murder of Emmett Till
is considered a defining moment of the civil rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   Till was visiting Mississippi from Chicago when he was kidnapped
and murdered, allegedly for whistling at a white woman. Jet published
a picture of the teen's badly mangled body in his casket.</TE>
<TE>   "Its stories and its pictures galvanized blacks into supporting
the civil rights movement," said Leroy Bryant, a Chicago State
University history professor who in the 1960s sold Jet on Chicago's
streets and subways.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine also deterred opponents of the civil rights movement,
contends Gregory, a frequent participant in protests.</TE>
<TE>   "White racists knew they could do anything to black folks and it
would never be reported in the white press," Gregory said. "But with
Jet around, that changed. The number of lynchings declined after the
Emmett Till pictures were published."</TE>
<TE>   For Jet and its sister publication, Ebony, which was founded in
1941, to effectively cover the civil rights movement in the South,
Johnson teamed a black writer with a white photographer.</TE>
<TE>   "Whites wouldn't talk to a black reporter, so he would talk
primarily to blacks," Johnson said. "And no one could figure out who
the white photographer was working for. They would meet at night and
exchange information."</TE>
<TE>   Earl G. Graves, publisher of Black Enterprise magazine, said
Johnson accomplished a major feat when he launched Jet and fought off
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it was the tragedy of Martin Luther King's assassination
or Colin Powell ascending to secretary of State, or a high school
student breaking a record, Jet is there all the time in a timely
way," Graves said.</TE>
<TE>   But Jet's reputation does not make it immune to criticism. Some
say the magazine's focus on celebrity and brief articles comes at the
expense of weightier issues. It is a criticism Linda Johnson
Rice--Johnson Publishing Co.'s president and Johnson's
daughter--acknowledges and rejects.</TE>
<TE>   "The book has only 64 pages, in which you can only do so much,"
she said. "We like to keep it short. If a story warrants more
in-depth coverage, we will do it."</TE>
<TE>   Those short and to-the-point articles first made Jet popular,
Bryant added.</TE>
<TE>   "It imparted information to a generation that was not as literate
as their children," he said. "They were like my father, who came to
Chicago from Arkansas with a third-grade education. Jet gave them
information quickly and precisely."</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the "Beauty of the Week," a photo of a shapely
woman in a bathing suit that gives Jet a hint of cheesecake. An
attempt to rid the magazine of the feature was reversed after a
deluge of complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably the first place where readers, whether male or
female, look," Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty years of tradition and Jet's readership are helping it as
the magazine industry is battered by a sharp decline in ad pages.</TE>
<TE>   Advertising spending already was dropping off due to a slowing
economy, and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have industry leaders
worried that the decline will worsen.</TE>
<TE>   Jet--which has a weekly circulation of about 950,000, although the
publisher claims readership is higher because copies are
shared--ended 2001 with ad sales relatively flat, Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   Samir A. Husni, a University of Mississippi journalism professor,
said ethnic magazines generally are less affected by ad declines
because their incomes largely come from subscriptions and readers are
loyal even in bad economic times.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the changes in the magazine industry, it has been
constant," Husni added. "Any magazine that can remain constant and
profitable is doing something right."</TE>

<LD>I've been an admirer of Dick Clark ever since he was a 40-year-old
teenager hosting American Bandstand in the late 1800s, but I'm not
sure he's got a winnable case, ["Dick Clark Sues Head of Grammys,"
Dec. 20].</LD>
<LD>   Clark is suing Michael Greene and the Grammys for allegedly
preventing Michael Jackson from performing on both Clark's American
Music Awards show and the Grammy broadcast. Sue him? I think a
bouquet of roses would be more fitting for anyone who restricts
Jackson to just one performance this winter.</LD>
<LD>   Greene, in his defense, says the embargo is merely part of
"standard industry practices." That's an unbeatable strategy for an
industry known for perfecting the art of payola and for forcing
songwriters to share royalties with record company execs.</LD>
<TE>   John Corcoran</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For Dick Clark to claim that he has "the best interests of
recording artists, the recording industry, and ... music fans" in
mind while he files a $10-million lawsuit against the president of
the Recording Academy is pure chutzpah.</TE>
<TE>   If Mr. Clark honestly wanted to help musicians and the record
industry, he would long ago have moved his show's broadcast forward
to November or December, when it could have promoted artists at the
key time of the year for their commercial exposure. This simple
adjustment would also avoid any conflict with the Grammys.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Clark's sour-grapes lawsuit is driven by only two things: his
ego and his greed.</TE>
<TE>   Hank Neuberger</TE>
<TE>   Chicago</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Get out the 10-ounce gloves and let Clark and Greene beat each
other senseless. True music fans won't be happy 'til both are seeing
stars.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was amused by "Grocers Try Fresh Ideas To Win Back Shoppers" [Jan.
6].</LD>
<LD>   By fresh ideas do you mean annoying "club cards" that require the
customer to surrender personal information before being allowed to
buy sale-priced items? How about that pricing structure from decades
ago where you are told, for instance, that 12 packs of soft drinks
are "three for $7.47."</LD>
<LD>   The variety of choices continues to shrink as national brands are
replaced with "store brands." This allows you to buy Cheddar cheese
that tastes like cheese-colored wax. All this while waiting in long
lines because the markets have cut staff in an attempt to save money.</LD>
<TE>   Oh well, at least you get to listen to lousy music played far too
loudly while you wait. It seems to me that large grocery chains are
trying their hardest to drive customers away rather than draw them
in.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems these days that everyone is an opportunist. A family is
suing an airline because they had to spend a few hours on a plane
that was diverted from LAX to Ontario due to bad weather. In "Family
Sues Northwest Air Over Christmas Day Delays" [Dec. 28], the Sheldons
claim to have suffered severe emotional distress, humiliation and
mental anguish. Among the egregious acts: "There was no Christmas
music piped in" said their lawyer. "It was claustrophobic" said a
family member.</LD>
<LD>   News flash: Air travel is cramped and comes with no guarantee of
your favorite music. It also comes with an implicit guarantee to land
as safely as possible and to avoid situations that would put you at
risk.</LD>
<LD>   The family should be grateful that they were sitting safely,
though cramped, on the airplane Christmas morning rather than having
attempted a risky landing at the intended airport during bad weather.</LD>

<TE>   Their lawyer is quoted as saying "We're going to be asking for
millions of dollars in punitive damages." I am surprised he didn't
also say the standard "it's not about the money." Yeah, right.</TE>
<TE>   This is just another example of the mentality of many in our
society that when anything bad happens (even bad weather), someone is
responsible and has to be sued.</TE>

<HD>Minimum Wage Increase Has Maximum Effect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sanford Thier excoriates the owner of Chanteclaire restaurant for
planning to lay off five workers due to the minimum wage increase
["Don't Link Layoffs, Minimum Wage Increase," Letters, Jan. 6]v. The
man has been in business for 42 years, I think he knows how to run a
restaurant better than Thier.</LD>
<LD>   The socialists masquerading as Democrats have not repealed the law
of supply and demand, as Thier seems to believe. Couple declining
revenues with higher labor costs and something has to give, and it in
this case it is five.</LD>
<LD>   Thier makes a bold leap of faith confusing cause with effect. He
concludes: "The point is that all this nonsense about minimum wage
increases causing job losses is economic nonsense. If that were true,
how do you explain what happened after the last minimum wage
increase? At that time, unemployment fell to its lowest levels in
years."</LD>
<TE>   Here is the explanation: At the time of the last minimum wage
increase, the economy was approaching full employment. There were
regions of the country where the prevailing wage for fast-food
workers was $2 above the minimum wage. During an expansionary cycle,
increasing revenue can exceed increasing labor costs, which will go
up, in any case, regardless of the minimum wage, as employers bid up
wages. During an economic contraction with decreasing revenues,
increasing labor costs through a minimum wage increase could be the
difference between profit and loss. You don't need a Nobel prize in
economics to figure this out.</TE>

<HD>What Price Those Holiday Bargains?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one in the media ever reports that all the retailers' claims about
having to slash prices on goods before Christmas "much deeper than
ever before at this time of year" are groundless, even after the
tragedy of Sept. 11. Each year at Christmas, retailers sing this same
refrain, but after the markdown, prices on identical or equivalent
items of apparel remain exactly the same as they were year after year
in the past. Or sometimes more.</LD>
<LD>   No wonder shoppers in malls appear to hang back. When they went
out looking for those big bargains they'd heard about in the news,
they discovered sweats, dress shirts, jeans and Dockers and women's
apparel cost exactly what they have for years after the much-lamented
"big new cuts" to lure buyers.</LD>
<LD>   With the average markup on apparel at 80%, retailers don't hurt if
they mark clothing down a mere 25% or even a better 40%, even after
they've covered costs of labor and overhead.</LD>
<TE>   Wouldn't it be refreshing for the media reporting these "big
never-before-seen markdowns" before Christmas to actually go out to
check on these claims by comparison shopping on items of apparel
these reporters bought last year for their families? But then it
would be too clear--there was no difference, and should have been no
story.</TE>

<LD>How can a man live off just $1million after receiving a $12.3-million
bonus last year ["Eisner's Paycheck Humbled in 2001," Jan. 5]?</LD>
<LD>   Maybe Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner will have to dig into
the $576 million he received in 1997. It's reported that even some of
his staff had to get by on a mere $300,000 bonus, and now they have
the gall to file a lawsuit against Michael Ovitz for the $140-million
severance pay they gave him for all the work he did in his 14-month
stay at Disney.</LD>
<LD>   Do you think that maybe a larger cut in payroll for the likes of
these execs might have saved the jobs of the 4,000 people they had to
lay off?</LD>

<HD>Credit Aid Agency Takes Issue With Article</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Credit Aid Agency's Strategy Draws Fire" [Dec. 24] mentions our
"signed agreement" with payday lenders without adequately describing
the nature of the agreement and its benefits to consumers. This,
along with several other inaccuracies, paints an erroneous picture of
our organization [Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Los Angeles]
and our long-standing commitment to serving consumers with integrity.</LD>
<LD>   Despite CCCS-LA's active role in supporting legislation to
regulate the payday loan industry, more consumers than ever before
find themselves in extreme financial difficulty as a result of
borrowing in this way. These consumers have never been systematically
referred to CCCS for assistance. Our agreement asks payday lenders to
refer their clients to us, in exactly the same way as other creditors
do. We are attempting to ensure that these consumers benefit from the
help and support they desperately need. The only revenue derived by
CCCS-LA from this agreement is the usual fair share contribution that
is paid by the lenders (not the consumers) on the amounts disbursed
to them each month.</LD>
<TE>   The article also infers that we will encourage people to file for
bankruptcy. CCCS-LA never has and will not encourage our clients to
do this. It is our policy that our counselors should, whenever
feasible, structure a debt-management program and only in those cases
where clients are in such a critical financial state that they cannot
be qualified for a debt repayment plan (by the standards set by their
creditors) are they advised to seek legal assistance. Of the
approximately 213,000 people that we counsel annually, only about
1,300 are advised to seek legal assistance.</TE>
<TE>   To serve those clients better, we are researching area law firms
to determine those with the highest ethical standards who will
economically provide bankruptcy services. Other services provided by
our wholly owned subsidiary will be pre- and post-bankruptcy
education of the type envisioned by the pending amendments to the
bankruptcy code, to ensure that clients are fully informed of the
implications and procedures involved in filing bankruptcy. The new
entity will also provide those clients who can only afford to
"self-file" with an economical "document preparation" service.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the article states that we will be providing
"bankruptcy advice." For the record, CCCS-LA and its subsidiary will
not provide legal advice. At the present time we refer clients to
area nonprofits such as Legal Aid and Public Counsel. In the future,
our subsidiary will also, when requested and appropriate, refer
clients to pre-qualified law firms after further economic analysis
has determined that bankruptcy is the only viable option.</TE>

<HD>Start Your Marriage Off Right-- Wise Up About Debt,
Spending</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My fiance and I are getting married in November and we have
to pay for the wedding ourselves. It is going to cost us in the
neighborhood of $20,000. We also have combined credit card debt of
about $18,000. We are confident that we can save $20,000 by the
wedding, but should we put that money in the bank or start using it
to make some large payments on the credit cards? Of course, using the
wedding money to reduce the debt might force us to start using the
credit cards again, but we thought it would look good to the
creditors if we were to occasionally send in more than just the
minimum.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Maybe you should start thinking less about looking good
and more about being smart.</LD>
<LD>   Honestly, people. You're already deeply in debt before you've even
started your life together. Why in the world are you considering
spending another small fortune for a one-day blowout?</LD>
<TE>   Pay off your credit cards and either postpone your wedding or have
a small affair that you can pay for upfront. You can find suggestions
about having a great, affordable wedding on the Dollar Stretcher Web
site at www.stretcher.com.</TE>
<TE>   If you've really got your heart set on a bash and you don't want
to postpone the nuptials, have an affordable wedding now and save up
your shekels for a big party on one of your anniversaries.</TE>
<TE>   Your creditors, by the way, generally don't care whether you pay
more than the minimum on your credit cards. In fact, they would
prefer you didn't--that's how they make their money and keep you in
financial chains.</TE>
<TE>   Consider that you're paying about $3,000 a year just to carry that
debt--$3,000 that's eating away at your financial health. If you were
to invest that money each year instead, you could have more than
$400,000 in 30 years, assuming a 9% annual return. Think about
that--you're giving up nearly half a million dollars just because
you're unwilling to live within your means.</TE>
<TE>   Give each other the best wedding present possible: Pay off your
debt and pare down your spending. Remember, if you have to pay for
something with credit--and it's not something that will appreciate in
value, such as a house--then you can't afford it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Credit Will Still Take Hit From Bankruptcy</TE>
<TE>   Q: My wife and I filed for bankruptcy eight years ago. Our lawyer
told us it would solve all of our debt problems and give us a new
start. Well, it has affected us big time. We've managed to slowly
rebuild our credit over the years, and the credit cards we managed to
keep from before the bankruptcy have rewarded us with steadily higher
credit limits. But every time we try to apply for new credit, we get
rejected and they list the bankruptcy as the reason. Why don't all
credit card companies play by the same rules?</TE>
<TE>   A: Because they don't have to.</TE>
<TE>   Credit card companies have different ways of trying to manage
their risk and maximize their profits. Most issuers, for example, try
to avoid people whose credit records show a history of late payments,
delinquencies or bankruptcies. Others relish the chance to get their
hooks into such "subprime" customers, who probably will give the
companies plenty of opportunities to charge late fees and punitive
interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   You're still viewed as damaged goods by the companies who want
only "prime" customers, so your best recourse is to wait until the
bankruptcy drops off your credit report before applying again. That
will take two more years, because bankruptcies remain on your report
for 10 years. Other negative items, such as late payments, generally
disappear after seven years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's OK to Give Number Out--This Time</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've written several times about the phone number to call if
you want to opt out of credit-card solicitations. I called this
number--(888) 5 OPT OUT or (888) 567-8688-- and they wanted to know
my Social Security number. With all of the "identify theft" these
days, how can we know that this is a legitimate service and not just
a way to get Social Security numbers? Who runs this service? I enjoy
your articles. If you could put my mind at ease, I would be grateful.</TE>
<TE>   A: Yours was one of several letters from people disturbed that
they were asked to punch in their Social Security numbers when they
called the opt-out number.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that you shouldn't reveal your number, or any other
personal financial information, willy-nilly. But your Social Security
number is essential for any transaction involving credit, including
this opt-out number--which is a service provided by four major credit
bureaus. You can feel safe giving out your Social Security number on
this line.</TE>

<HD>Strong Home Values a Shelter for Economy</HD>
<DH>Real estate: The residential market is helping Southern
California avoid a repeat of the recession of the early 1990s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN and DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California's buoyant residential real estate market and
rising home values are a key factor shielding the region from
recession. That marks a sharp contrast with the early and mid-1990s,
when falling prices and slow sales contributed to the area's worst
economic collapse since the Depression.</LD>
<LD>   The strength of residential real estate also is benefiting other
U.S. metropolitan areas. But few, if any, have enjoyed rebounds as
dramatic as Southern California's.</LD>
<LD>   It is a major reason Southern California is suffering only a
slowdown while the San Francisco Bay Area, hurt by a deep downturn in
high technology that has deflated home prices lower, is in recession.</LD>
<TE>   Real estate has remained a stable source of jobs for the local
economy, including employment for construction workers, lenders and
real estate agents. Even more important, analysts say, is how rising
home values have supported consumer spending.</TE>
<TE>   Strong home values and low interest rates have combined to spur a
wave of refinancing. That has enabled consumers to cut monthly
mortgage payments, and sometimes take out cash as well, providing a
local economic stimulus.</TE>
<TE>   "If you cut your mortgage payment, it's just like a monthly tax
rebate check. It's a big deal for maintaining purchasing power," said
Stephen Levy, director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing
Study of the California Economy.</TE>
<TE>   Economists say high home equity, particularly in areas such as
Southern California, also has kept consumer confidence from falling
further amid the U.S. recession. As a result, they say, consumers
continue buying cars, homes and other items.</TE>
<TE>   All the same, the local real estate business hasn't been enough of
a force to prevent a slowdown in the region's growth. And it could
become less of a prop for the local economy, with home building in
the region expected to decline moderately this year and most of the
mortgage-refinancing surge apparently over.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, Southern California's residential real estate
business is providing economic staying power and helping the region
resist the national recession.</TE>
<TE>   "It has translated into spending we didn't see in the last
downturn," said Fred Furlong, an economist with the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases, such as that of Virginia Bock, home equity has
provided a financial safety net. After Sept. 11, Bock knew her job as
a product manager for an airline services company in Orange County
was in jeopardy. She responded by quickly refinancing the mortgage on
her Irvine townhouse, reducing her monthly loan payment to $1,300
from nearly $1,500. As part of her new loan, Bock obtained a $100,000
line of credit allowing her to borrow money by drawing on her home
equity.</TE>
<TE>   Bock was right about her job--she was dismissed Nov. 1. By relying
on her savings and the benefits of her new home loan, Bock said, she
can stay in her townhouse and survive financially until at least this
fall, if she can't find a good job before then.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm really not in a bad situation,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate specialists such as mortgage broker Edward J.
Rosenblum, co-owner of Flagship Mortgage in the San Fernando Valley,
say the difference is striking between the situation today and the
devastating Southern California recession of the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Rosenblum ran a mortgage finance operation in the Antelope
Valley and worked with home builders. One of the big problems, he
said, was that would-be home buyers balked at going ahead with
purchases, despite plummeting prices, because they sensed that prices
might go even lower.</TE>
<TE>   Some Antelope Valley home builders couldn't persuade people to buy
even with offers of free swimming pools and allowances of $20,000 to
$25,000 for upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   Things were so grim that at one failed housing development in
Lancaster, unfinished homes were sold to the filmmakers of "Lethal
Weapon 3" and used as the background in a simulated inferno scene.
(The homes weren't actually burned down, but they were bulldozed
after filming was over.)</TE>
<TE>   In other cases, homeowners handed the house keys to their mortgage
lenders because they owed more on their mortgages than the homes were
worth.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Rosenblum said, people eager to buy homes stream into
his office, and refinancing deals remain an active part of his
business. In fact, lenders locally are fighting for refinancing
customers--unlike a decade ago, when plummeting prices left many
Southern Californians with little or no equity to tap.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have equity in a house, and you have a pulse, somebody
will make you a loan," Rosenblum said.</TE>
<TE>   And homeowners are plump with equity. That reflects skyrocketing
home values in Southern California, including the five Los
Angeles-area counties and San Diego County. DataQuick Information
Systems Inc., a La Jolla firm that tracks real estate trends, said
the value of a median-price house in Southern California climbed
$2,468 a month last year.</TE>
<TE>   Although other metropolitan areas also enjoyed substantial
appreciation, DataQuick found that Southern California's advance in
value was more than four times the national gain.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Southern California's home values tumbled during the
region's prolonged recession in the early 1990s while values rose
elsewhere. According to an analysis by Economy.com, a consulting firm
in West Chester, Pa., the median sales price for Southern California
homes fell 18% from a pre-recession high of $206,600 in the fourth
quarter of 1989 to a low of $168,800 in the third quarter of 1996.</TE>
<TE>   During the same period, Economy.com said, the median sales price
nationally climbed 26% to $115,600 from $91,600.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of Southern California's housing market, particularly
in Los Angeles County, largely stemmed from the severe retrenchment
in the aerospace industry and the loss of jobs, many of them
high-paying.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, home builders, after putting up one development after
another in the 1980s, abruptly cut back.</TE>
<TE>   That brought the loss of thousands of jobs and upheaval in real
estate-related fields, from construction to savings and loans, many
of which failed. Building, in particular, "stopped dead in its
tracks," Rosenblum said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Home Equity Turns Into a Reserve Fund</TE>
<TE>   By some accounts, the real estate decline was second only to the
aerospace retrenchment in causing the region's recession. Then the
real estate market was dragged down further by the 1994 Northridge
earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1990s, Southern California's slow recovery was gaining
momentum. The population grew and home building came back, but
nowhere near the dizzying levels of the 1980s. The housing supply got
tighter, particularly in Los Angeles and Orange counties, causing a
shortage that pushed up prices, even after the national recession
began in March.</TE>
<TE>   When mortgage interest rates fell to a 30-year low last year and
triggered a home-refinancing boom across the country, Southern
California was one of the hubs of activity. Home equity turned into a
reserve fund, or piggy bank, that fueled consumer spending even as
the job market worsened.</TE>
<TE>   According to DataQuick, lenders provided a record $116 billion in
home-refinancing deals last year in Southern California, more than
triple the level in 2000. "For a lot of families, it's more important
than the stock market," said John Mitchell, an economist who tracks
California and other Western states for U.S. Bancorp.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Del Rosario-Heard and her husband, Edwin Heard, took
advantage of the opportunity to refinance. They pulled a total of
$150,000 in cash out of their residence in Mission Viejo and an
investment house in Dana Point.</TE>
<TE>   They used the money to pay off one car, buy another car, eliminate
debts and invest in other real estate. And they have cash left over.
For now, they are through with paying interest on credit card debt.</TE>
<TE>   Del Rosario-Heard said those changes have brought her "peace of
mind."</TE>
<TE>   "I have less stress," said Del Rosario-Heard, 43, a psychiatric
nurse. "I have enough money in the bank for bills, for emergencies
and even investments."</TE>
<TE>   The financial cushion provided by real estate for the national and
regional economies has limits, however. Although homeownership spread
to a record 67.9% of U.S. households in the third quarter of 2001,
not everyone owns a house.</TE>
<TE>   Also, more U.S. homeowners are getting into trouble managing their
mortgage payments, signaling the possibility of rising foreclosures
and weaker real estate markets ahead. A report released last month
found that the percentage of mortgages more than 30 days past due was
4.87% in the third quarter of 2001, up from 4.01% in the same period
a year earlier and the highest level in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts attributed most of that rise to the nation's recession.
Other factors, they say, are the growing number of low-income
homeowners, predatory lending practices and borrowers who have taken
on too much debt in their home loans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Homes Can Sell Within Two Weeks</TE>
<TE>   For California, though, the news is better. The state has yet to
show a major rise in mortgage delinquencies. In the third quarter,
its past-due rate was 3.76%, up from 3.18% a year earlier, but down
from 3.97% at the end of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Local homeowners who have lost their jobs and are truly in
desperate financial shape can, in many cases, sell their homes at a
profit and avoid foreclosure. That's a far cry from much of the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Furth, an agent at Coldwell Banker in Northridge and
president of the Southland Regional Assn. of Realtors, remembers the
early 1990s as a time when homes typically sat on the market for six
months or more. She said brokers would give away lottery tickets and
gift certificates to Nordstrom to drum up business for open houses.</TE>
<TE>   Today, she said, "there's so little inventory that if something is
priced right, it's not unusual for a home to sell in two weeks."</TE>

<HD>'Short-Sellers' in Enron Finally Get Their Due</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. may be the best friend that Wall Street's "short-sellers"
ever had.</LD>
<LD>   Some of these professional bears bet against the energy company's
stock early last year, smelling a fraud. Yet any monetary gain they
reaped could be of modest value compared with the long-term benefit
to their image thanks to Enron's demise.</LD>
<LD>   That's because the principal lessons Enron has taught investors
are about the need to question glowing corporate forecasts of sales
and earnings, to dig deeper into companies' financial statements, and
to think twice before affording sky-high price-to-earnings multiples
to stocks of businesses heavy on hype and light on specifics.</LD>
<TE>   Those are the hallmarks of professional short-sellers. Though
often reviled for the end product of their work--the actual
"shorting" of stocks, meaning borrowing and selling shares, hoping
the price declines so the loaned shares can be replaced at lower cost
in the future--short-sellers may be the last bastion of hard-nosed
research left on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of work to short a stock," said Bill Fleckenstein, a
veteran short-seller who heads Fleckenstein Capital in Issaquah,
Wash. "You have to be right."</TE>
<TE>   They aren't always right, of course. But Enron is a prime example
of how short-sellers' questioning of the conventional wisdom can
prove to be spectacularly on target.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few voices raised against Enron a year ago was that of
James Chanos, a well-known research-intensive short-seller who heads
Kynikos Associates in New York. Chanos publicly questioned other
analysts' assumptions about Enron's true profitability and made the
argument that the company was merely a disguised "hedge fund"--a
high-risk trading operation that didn't deserve the huge valuation
investors had given it.</TE>
<TE>   But Chanos got little publicity, and most institutional money
managers were far more interested in hearing the upbeat
pronouncements coming from then-Enron CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling and
from the army of brokerage analysts covering the company.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Chanos' warnings belie the line heard most often on Wall
Street today, as big investors and analysts try to explain why they
didn't see Enron's collapse coming. The line is, "We were totally
snookered--the company deceived the government, its auditors, and
us."</TE>
<TE>   Baloney, says James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate
Observer newsletter in New York and a longtime ally of the
short-selling community. "I do not buy for one minute" the idea that
anyone paying close attention to Enron's finances wouldn't have seen
the same warning flags that Chanos did, Grant argues.</TE>
<TE>   "And if it [Enron] was so opaque, why did people own it?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   Led by a handful of professional skeptics, more investors did
short Enron stock as 2001 wore on. But those bets rose relatively
slowly, and even by September--after Skilling had resigned and the
share price was crumbling--a modest 13.8 million Enron shares (less
than 2% of the total outstanding) had been shorted, according to New
York Stock Exchange data.</TE>
<TE>   In November, as bankruptcy neared, short-selling of Enron stock
soared. But the big money would have been made by shorting the stock
at $80 early in 2001, and holding that bet, rather than shorting it
at $10 in November. (The profit on a short sale, after all, is the
difference between the price at which borrowed stock is sold and the
price at which shares are bought back to repay the loan. Enron shares
were trading Friday at about 51 cents.)</TE>
<TE>   Short-selling of stock in general was at record levels as of
mid-December, the latest data available from the NYSE and Nasdaq. Yet
professional short-sellers say those figures are misleading. Most
shorting is connected with strategies other than betting on an
overvalued stock's collapse, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Many short sales are made to hedge "long" bets--for example, an
investor may short one stock in an industry to protect against a
decline in a rival stock the investor owns, should the entire sector
take a sudden hit.</TE>
<TE>   The community of money managers who are actively researching
stocks to short is tiny, Fleckenstein said. In all, he estimates
there may be less than $1 billion committed to short-selling funds
such as his own. The funds' clients typically are institutional
investors and wealthy individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Short-sellers have never been a huge group on Wall Street, but
they enjoyed a higher profile--and endured substantial public
wrath--in the late-1980s, after the 1987 market crash.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the famous short-sellers of that era, in particular the
Feshbach brothers of Palo Alto, were accused of spreading lies about
stocks to knock them down and thus profit from short sales.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the great bull market of the 1990s. Shorting stocks,
which, at a minimum, always smacks of being un-American, turned fatal
for many practitioners.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index produced a total return
of more than 20% for five straight years ending in 1999. Worse for
many short-sellers, the S&amp;P was led by its technology stocks, a
sector that some short-sellers believed had become overvalued by
1998.</TE>
<TE>   As tech shares continued to climb, a bet against a stock because
it was overvalued by traditional standards meant certain failure for
many short-sellers, as the overvalued simply became more overvalued.</TE>
<TE>   Some short-sellers learned the hard way just how risky the
strategy can be. If you buy a stock outright, the most you can lose
is your entire investment.</TE>
<TE>   But a short-seller's losses are potentially unlimited: If you
short a stock at, say, $50, and the market price then rises instead
of falls, your losses mount until you buy back the stock on the open
market and repay the loaned shares (which usually are lent by
brokerages).</TE>
<TE>   Now, even in the wake of the deepest and longest bear market in a
generation, most of the remaining short-sellers say that, so far,
there is no rush of new money coming their way from investors.</TE>
<TE>   David Tice, a Dallas money manager who heads the $200-million
Prudent Bear mutual fund largely dedicated to short-selling, says the
amount of money he has attracted after each major market sell-off of
the last few years has declined sequentially. His fund was up 7.4%
last year even as the broad market plunged.</TE>
<TE>   Tice remains a raging bear. He sees "tons" of stocks to short, he
said, given his outlook for the economy to remain troubled and his
belief that many stocks are drastically overvalued relative to
companies' earnings potential in the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   If any event draws more investors to consider trusting
professional short-sellers with at least a portion of their
portfolios, it ought to be Enron's rise and thunderous fall.</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, Fleckenstein considers the relative lack of
interest in short-sellers to be a sure sign that the bear market
isn't over, because most people believe otherwise. "I find it
comforting," he said.</TE>

<HD>Easing the Pain of Health-Care Costs</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Buying your own coverage? You can opt for a
higher deductible and cut expenses for drugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cost of health insurance hit Joan Little like an oncoming train.
For 30 years she was blissfully ignorant of health expenses, thanks
to coverage provided by her employer.</LD>
<LD>   But then she retired at age 52--long before Medicare coverage
kicks in--and suddenly needed to buy health insurance on her own.</LD>
<LD>   "What a shock," Little said. The health maintenance organization
she chose charged a stunning $3,912 a year in premiums.</LD>
<TE>   Little's insurance premiums are now half what they were six years
ago, despite skyrocketing health insurance costs. The reason: She
researched her health insurance options and learned that she could
reduce her premiums by taking on more risk.</TE>
<TE>   Little now pays just $150 a month in premiums for a
high-deductible health insurance policy. Because she's both
physically healthy and financially secure, the routine medical bills
she must handle usually cost far less than buying a more
comprehensive insurance plan.</TE>
<TE>   People who need to buy their health insurance--because they lost a
job, retired early or lost the insurance they once had through a
former spouse--should take note. Many individuals, particularly those
with children or chronic ailments, might not be able to make Little's
cost-saving decision to shoulder more of the risk of her own health
care.</TE>
<TE>   But education and preparation can pave the way to cost reduction
and better health care, whether through lower premiums, savings on
emergency care or reduced prescription costs.</TE>
<TE>   Even workers with company-subsidized insurance often can save
money by becoming more familiar with their health options.</TE>
<TE>   "The single most important thing that an individual can do is be
as well informed as possible," said Joe Luchok, spokesman for the
Health Insurance Assn. of America in Washington. "It takes some time
and effort, but it's well worth it."</TE>
<TE>   Here's what you need to know.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What Are Your Options?</TE>
<TE>   Individuals threatened with the loss of health insurance because
they have been laid off, recently divorced or widowed can continue
their current coverage under their former employer's or spouse's
plan. This option, called COBRA, extends coverage to people facing
sudden loss of health insurance for a limited period--18 to 36
months.</TE>
<TE>   But prepare for sticker shock. Most employee health insurance
costs are subsidized by employers, who pay about 80% of the expenses,
according to national benefit consulting firm Towers Perrin.</TE>
<TE>   When COBRA coverage kicks in, the subsidies stop and the plan can
charge for administrative costs. The average unsubsidized cost of
health insurance is $228 a month for a single person and $661 a month
for family coverage, according to Towers Perrin. That's $2,736 and
$7,932 a year, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, healthy consumers can find less expensive coverage.
But they may need to give up some of the benefits--such as
prescription drug coverage and low co-payments--that commonly come
with employer-provided group health plans.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it makes more sense to buy COBRA coverage or find
insurance on your own will depend on the cost of your company's COBRA
plan, your family circumstances and your other options.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other Options</TE>
<TE>   There are three basic types of health insurance. Traditional
insurance plans, called indemnity plans, allow you to choose your
doctors and make more decisions about your health care. But you pay a
deductible before coverage kicks in, and usually a 20% co-payment for
each doctor and hospital visit.</TE>
<TE>   Health maintenance organizations limit consumer choices when
seeing a doctor, but there are generally no deductibles to satisfy
and co-payments are modest--usually $5 to $10 per doctor visit.</TE>
<TE>   Hybrid plans, such as preferred provider organizations,
incorporate elements of managed care and traditional insurance. PPO
plans, for instance, will pay for a portion of health costs,
regardless of the doctor, but they'll pay a higher percentage of the
costs if the consumer sees a doctor who's part of the PPO network.</TE>
<TE>   The premiums for each of these types of insurance vary widely,
based on factors such as where the policyholder lives and whether a
deductible must be satisfied before coverage kicks in.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Assess Use of Services</TE>
<TE>   To determine which plan will be most cost-effective, consumers
need to do more than compare premiums. They also must assess how they
use health care.</TE>
<TE>   Those who use a lot of medical services--families with small
children, people in frail health or with chronic illnesses--are
likely to have significantly lower out-of-pocket costs with an HMO.
But for the consumer who goes to a doctor outside the network, that
care usually is not covered.</TE>
<TE>   PPOs often are the best choice for a family that is willing to get
most care through the system but might want to occasionally go
outside the network.</TE>
<TE>   Little chose an indemnity plan because she's healthy and likes to
choose her doctors. Her plan, which has a $2,000 deductible, has an
extremely low premium--$150 a month. But if she has a lot of medical
needs in any given year, she knows the indemnity plan will cost her
more than her former HMO. The coverage only protects her from major
medical expenses she can't afford. She must shoulder most of the
day-to-day expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Still, because she has no dependents and is rarely sick, she
spends the bulk of her health-care dollars on premiums. For her, the
indemnity plan is the best deal.</TE>
<TE>   "No one plan is best for everyone," Luchok said. "You have to look
at your particular situation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Be Prepared</TE>
<TE>   Chest pains. Bad fall. Deep cut. Is it an emergency? The answer
often determines whether a managed-care plan will cover the cost.
Consumers who make a bad call can end up with thousands of dollars in
medical expenses that aren't reimbursed.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency care is generally the most expensive way to treat an
ailment. Although cost is an incidental issue in a real emergency,
families often rush to an emergency room when they would have
received better--and more cost-effective-- treatment elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers should be familiar with their health plan and create a
system for managing medical crises before they happen, said Johan
Dekeyzer, health-care consultant with Hewitt Associates in Newport
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Most health plans offer several levels of care. Some have a
so-called nurse line benefit, an after-hours service that can advise
on everything from over-the-counter medications to whether an
emergency room visit appears warranted.</TE>
<TE>   Many plans offer access to urgent-care centers, which are a step
between an emergency room and a doctor's office and are considerably
less expensive than an emergency room.</TE>
<TE>   Get organized before emergencies arise, Dekeyzer suggested. Jot
down the phone number for the doctor's office and the nurse line and
the address and hours of the nearest urgent-care center. Consider
which level of care is appropriate for the most likely medical
crises--from broken bones to chest pains. That eliminates looking for
phone numbers and wondering what to do in a crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk through the condition and find out if you need to go to [an
emergency room] now, the urgent- care center later or the doctor
tomorrow," Dekeyzer said. "Knowing how to use your benefits will save
you a lot of money and a lot of hassle."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Consider Prescriptions</TE>
<TE>   Prescription drug costs are rising even more rapidly than the
overall cost of health care, which makes managing drug expenses even
more important.</TE>
<TE>   The prescription management process starts in the doctor's office,
Luchok said. Ask questions about the prescription the doctor is
writing and whether other drugs will do the job for less money.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, doctors are willing to provide drug samples or
prescribe generic drugs that are a fraction of the cost of a
brand-name medication. The savings from generic drugs can be
particularly compelling for those with chronic ailments.</TE>
<TE>   If consumers are willing to shop around, brand-name drugs can be
purchased at discounted prices.</TE>
<TE>   "I can go to Costco and get medicines for a fraction of what I had
been paying," Little said. "My first prescription, which cost $110 at
the pharmacy, was only $80 there. Another went from $137 to $106. A
mail-order pharmacy that my aunt uses is about the same."</TE>
<TE>   The Internet provides a great way to compare costs, Little added.
"Another friend of mine went online and got a prescription for half
the price," she said. "It's bizarre, but if you work at it, the
savings are out there."</TE>

<HD>Prepare Now for 2003 Health-Care Expenses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's too late for workers to do much about the latest increases in
their out-of-pocket health-care costs. But they can start planning
now to ease the pain in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   By laying the groundwork this year, workers can position
themselves to take advantage of a widely offered but little-used
employee benefit called health-care spending accounts.</LD>
<LD>   The accounts, which allow employees to set aside part of their
pretax wages to pay their share of medical and dental bills, may grow
in popularity as employers respond to rising health-care costs by
shifting more of the burden to their  employees.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of these spending accounts allow you to get certain
elective treatments that might not be covered by your health plan, so
you even broaden your coverage somewhat," said Johan Dekeyzer, a
health-care consultant with Hewitt Associates in Newport Beach. "But
you have to be cognizant of what your needs are going to be."</TE>
<TE>   Medical spending accounts, offered by about 85% of large
employers, can provide substantial savings  for families that
require frequent health-care services.</TE>
<TE>   Because the money deposited in the account is taken out of a
paycheck before taxes, each $1,000 saved in an account costs a
middle-income worker about $600. (That assumes a 27% federal tax, 5%
state tax and 7.65% employment tax--or FICA--rate.)  That means
employee-paid expenses such as co-payments, deductibles and
out-of-network charges are cut about 40% when they're paid from these
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   There's a catch, however. Money that's put into an account but not
spent during the year is lost. And employees get just one chance each
year to declare how much they want to save--during a company's
open-enrollment period, which is usually in the fall--and that amount
generally can't be changed until the following year. If you save too
much, you lose the unspent amount. If you don't save enough, you miss
a chance to pay necessary medical expenses with tax-free income.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of losing a portion of the savings is a key reason
that only about 10% of eligible employees use medical spending
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The solution: Keep track of your health-care spending now so you
can make an educated estimate of how much to set aside for your 2003
medical expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Many employers provide worksheets and booklets to help workers
estimate expenses that aren't reimbursed in any given health
insurance plan. If you still have the worksheets from your last
open-enrollment period, use them to note medical expenses throughout
2002.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care spending accounts can be used to pay a variety of
medical costs that may not be covered by your health plan, such as
orthodontia, the extra cost of a private hospital room, private duty
nursing or medical expenses of a dependent who is not covered by your
plan, such as a dependent parent.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, money in the accounts can be used to pay for special
schooling for a child with mental or physical disabilities, treatment
of psychological or nervous conditions, chiropractic expenses, laser
eye surgery, glasses or contact lenses, guide dogs, Braille books and
magazines and even special equipment to modify a house or car to
accommodate a family member with a disability, according to CCH Inc.,
a Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of tax and benefit information.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how the spending plans work:</TE>
<TE>   A family of four typically has half a dozen doctor visits with a
co-payment of $10 a visit, for a total of $60. Prescription drug
costs that aren't reimbursed amount to $200 annually. Dentist visits,
not covered by the family's health plan, cost $400. And the dentist
recommends braces for both children, which will cost more than $1,500
a child.</TE>
<TE>   This family should put $2,160, or $180 a month, into a health-care
spending account to pay medical and dental expenses, plus the cost of
the oldest child's braces. Next year, they'd do the same, setting
aside money for the younger child's braces.</TE>
<TE>   The after-tax cost of the $2,160 the family put in its medical
spending account is about $1,300--a savings of $850.</TE>
<TE>   On the downside, the accounts require paperwork. Medical bills
must be paid upfront and forms must be filled out to get
reimbursement from the savings account. But the savings are worth the
extra effort.</TE>

<LD>Enron Probe Uncovers More Revelations</LD>
<LD>   More revelations pored forth last week about the days leading up
to Enron Corp.'s spectacular bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   A detailed road map of Enron's aggressive accounting maneuvers and
an uncannily accurate prediction of the company's collapse were laid
before Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in August in a lengthy memo
written by a vice president.</LD>
<TE>   Enron's auditor, Andersen, fired the partner in charge of Enron's
audits for ordering the destruction of thousands of Enron-related
e-mails and documents soon after the Securities and Exchange
Commission asked for information about the energy trader's books.</TE>
<TE>   That in part prompted SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt to outline plans
for a private oversight body to discipline accountants and review
company audits.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Enron's proposed sale of its core energy-trading
business to UBS Warburg raises the question: Without its crown jewel,
what is Enron?</TE>
<TE>   Until only a few months ago, the Houston-based company was the
world's largest energy trader.</TE>
<TE>   But now, under Bankruptcy Court protection, Enron is frantically
unloading assets, including its once-dominant trading operation, its
Oregon utility, its best natural gas pipeline and a variety of
international assets.</TE>
<TE>   If all of these deals are completed, Enron could end up much as it
began, a smallish operator of scattered pipelines.</TE>
<TE>   And Enron was bumped from the New York Stock Exchange to the
lowest tier of regular securities trading--the unregulated "pink
sheets."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kmart Gives Rescuer the Green Light</TE>
<TE>   Kmart Corp. moved to stem some of its woe last week by tapping
retailing turnaround expert James B. Adamson to help rescue the
nation's second-largest discount chain.</TE>
<TE>   But speculation remained that the company may be headed to
Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   Adamson, a Kmart director who steered the Advantica restaurant
company and Revco drugstore chain through bankruptcy reorganizations,
becomes the retailer's chairman. Charles C. Conaway remains chief
executive. Mark S. Schwartz departed as president and chief operating
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said it was incumbent upon the company to take some
action, as its credit quality and stock price continues to flag.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service cut their Kmart
ratings twice, and its stock lost about 50% over the last five
trading days, closing Friday at $1.74.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WTO Won't Give U.S. a Break</TE>
<TE>   The World Trade Organization ruled that a tax break for U.S.
exporters was illegal, opening the door for Europe to impose as much
as $4 billion in duties on U.S. exports as punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the United States repeals or amends its tax code, it could
face a bitter trade war with its European allies as well as the
largest penalty imposed in the six years that the Geneva-based WTO
has been regulating commerce.</TE>
<TE>   A WTO panel is scheduled to meet in late March to finalize the
duties and to decide which exports will be targeted. The list could
include airplanes, chemicals, toys and food.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between the United States and Europe already were
strained over threatened U.S. penalties on steel imported from Europe
and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Given the financial stakes and the fragile state of the global
economy, many officials say they expect the U.S. and Europe to craft
a face-saving compromise that will avoid a costly trade war.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Turbulence for Airline Earnings</TE>
<TE>   Putting the last touches on a portrait of a horrendous year, the
major airlines began reporting massive fourth-quarter losses that
reflected the slump in air travel after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   American Airlines parent AMR Corp. said its loss, a quarterly
record for the nation's largest carrier, totaled $734 million.</TE>
<TE>   Continental, Northwest and US Airways also posted huge quarterly
losses.</TE>
<TE>   The industry altogether is expected to lose at least $6 billion
for all of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But maverick Southwest Airlines, the low-cost short-haul leader,
again managed a slim fourth-quarter profit despite the bleak industry
conditions. Southwest earned $32.4 million before one-time items.</TE>
<TE>   On the positive side, the airlines say passenger traffic continues
to gradually build, helped by fare sales.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the gains reflect leisure travel, and the carriers
don't expect business traffic to climb substantially until the U.S.
economy improves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bonuses Prescribed for Best Doctors</TE>
<TE>   Six of California's largest health insurers plan to begin paying
bonuses to doctors for providing top-notch care.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative is one among several nationwide that provides
further evidence that the current system of fixed HMO payments for
patient care is rapidly coming unglued.</TE>
<TE>   The health plans are Aetna Inc., Blue Cross of California, Blue
Shield of California, Cigna Corp., Health Net Inc. and PacifiCare
Health Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Together, they are devising a set of standards for measuring care
and plan to publish report cards on doctors' performance and reward
medical groups with bonuses of 5% to 10% for meeting or exceeding the
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Critics are skeptical, and the consortium acknowledged that
creating a fund for doctor bonuses might have to come from higher
customer premiums.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Suit by Sunbeam Shareholders Settled</TE>
<TE>   Albert J. Dunlap, the business leader dubbed "Chainsaw Al" for his
slash-and-burn approach to fixing troubled companies, agreed to pay
$15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders of Sunbeam
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, set to go to trial last week, accused Dunlap and other
Sunbeam executives of mismanagement and fraud at the small-appliance
maker. Dunlap served as chairman and chief executive from 1996 to
1998.</TE>
<TE>   The suit stemmed from Sunbeam's abrupt financial nose dive in the
late 1990s. Sunbeam filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   A judge must approve the settlement, in which Dunlap did not admit
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Sunbeam's former auditor, accounting giant Andersen, agreed last
year to pay $110 million to settle securities-fraud litigation
brought by Sunbeam shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weak Tech Earnings Send Strong Signal</TE>
<TE>   Firms at the top of the hierarchy such as Microsoft Corp., Yahoo
Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp. sparked optimism on Wall Street with
earnings--anemic compared with the boom years of the late 1990s--that
nonetheless signaled that the period of freefall has come to an end.</TE>
<TE>   Those front-line companies are best positioned to feel reawakening
demand from consumers and businesses. But they are the first links of
a long chain of events that will take at least a year to ripple
through the high-tech economy.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, tech stocks fell after chip-making giant Intel Corp.
said it would cut its capital spending 25% in 2002 despite
fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MGM Failed to Attract Bidders</TE>
<TE>   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. majority shareholder Kirk Kerkorian was
hoping to sell the legendary studio, but has failed to attract the
kind of promising bids he wants from major media companies, industry
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The billionaire was hoping that a suitor--perhaps Walt Disney Co.,
Viacom Inc., Vivendi Universal or AOL Time Warner Inc.--would pony up
$30 a share or more to get their hands on MGM's vast film library of
more than 4,100 titles, which include the James Bond and the Pink
Panther series.</TE>

<HD>Tauzin Focusing His Energy on Enron</HD>
<DH>Investigation: The GOP congressman has been aggressive in
his inquiry in the firm's collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER  and JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Lining the walls of Louisiana Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin's office are
some of his prized hunting trophies: an owl, a wild turkey, deer and
even the stuffed head of an alligator with Mardis Gras beads dangling
from its teeth.</LD>
<LD>   Judging by the vigor with which the powerful chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee is stalking players in the Enron Corp.
scandal, Tauzin would love to add some of the energy company's
executives and its Andersen accountants to his wall, as well.</LD>
<LD>   No member of Congress has been more aggressive in investigating
Enron's collapse than Tauzin. His committee has been investigating
the financial meltdown for two months. His staff has unearthed some
of the most damning evidence yet, including the internal memo of an
Enron vice president warning that the company was about to "implode
in a wave of accounting scandals." And Tauzin has made clear that his
committee is just getting started.</LD>
<TE>   All of which has some in Washington scratching their heads,
because there are reasons Tauzin might be expected to step into this
furor very reluctantly.</TE>
<TE>   His Gulf Coast district is dominated by energy companies that did
business with Enron. He--like many in Washington--has taken thousands
of dollars in contributions from the now-bankrupt company.</TE>
<TE>   Most puzzling of all, he is a high-ranking GOP lawmaker leading
the charge on a matter that has been a source of embarrassment to
Republicans, especially the Bush White House.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin, 58, dismisses suggestions that he might be inclined to
pull his punches, saying anyone who would suggest so doesn't
understand the seriousness of the scandal, the stakes of the
investigation or the populist politics of Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to pursue this wherever it leads us," Tauzin said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats doubt that Tauzin will be eager to pursue the
investigation wherever it leads, noting that so far he hasn't called
for the White House to surrender any records of its apparently
extensive contacts with Enron executives.</TE>
<TE>   Many Republicans, meanwhile, are quietly pleased that Tauzin is
forging ahead, shielding them from criticism that they may be soft on
a company that gave generously to both parties, but was among the
GOP's most lavish donors over the last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "People are glad Tauzin is being aggressive and is out there," a
House GOP leadership aide said. "We take this very seriously. We need
to appear to be on top of the game. We cannot let the Democrats have
the field."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Enron was widely considered one of the glowing
lights of the new economy. But the Houston-based energy trading
company began to unravel last fall amid questions about its
accounting practices. Ultimately, the company was forced to
acknowledge that it had overstated its earnings by nearly $600
million, and it filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2. Thousands of
Enron employees lost their jobs, and many lost their retirement
savings, which were heavily invested in Enron stock.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse caught the White House in its swirl because Enron was
among the biggest political donors to President Bush. Also, Enron
executives were consulted as the White House developed its energy
plan last year, and they requested help from key administration
officials as it sank into bankruptcy. The White House appears to have
rebuffed those requests.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Enron's largess was so extensive that conflicts
loom everywhere. The company and its employees gave money to 51 of
the 56 members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee over the
last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin (pronounced TOE-zan) was among them, though far from the
top of the list. From 1989 to 2001, the company and its employees
contributed $6,464 to him, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics. By contrast, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), chairman of the
panel's energy subcommittee, garnered $28,909 from the company.</TE>
<TE>   Embarrassed by the scandal, many lawmakers have pledged to donate
any Enron contributions they accepted to a fund set up for the
company's laid-off workers.</TE>
<TE>   But Tauzin, part of a long line of Louisiana politicians who don't
embarrass easily,  said he won't give the money back and that Enron
was foolish if it thought it could influence him.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin got considerably more from Andersen, collecting $57,000
from 1989 to 2001. Only one member of Congress, Sen. Phil Gramm
(R-Texas), got more from the accounting company during that period.</TE>
<TE>   With Democrats looking for any opportunity to tar the GOP with the
scandal, Tauzin can't afford to be anything short of vigorous in the
investigation, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows that the best defense is a good offense," said Tom Mann,
a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution. "The last thing
Republicans want to do is be put in a position of defending Enron and
Andersen."</TE>
<TE>   The politics of Tauzin's energy ties are more complicated than
they appear, experts said. His district has one of the largest
concentrations of petrochemical plants in the country, and he
acknowledges that many of them did business with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the companies with a large presence in his district
have been at odds with Enron on industry deregulation and other
issues. And the perceived arrogance of Enron executives during the
company's meteoric rise alienated industry peers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no love lost for Enron among energy companies and
utilities," said former Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), who is now
an industry lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin is part of a long tradition of colorful deal-cutting
Louisiana politicians. He is the only member of Congress with a
French-Cajun Web site, and he makes gumbo, a main course at his many
fund-raisers, from his own cookbook.</TE>
<TE>   He worked on an oil rig to put himself through college, and was a
roommate of Sen. John Breaux (D-La.) while studying law at Louisiana
State University.</TE>
<TE>   An avid sportsman, he owns a small hunting club on Maryland's
Eastern Shore and makes no apologies for the fact that its members
include lobbyists eager for help from his committee.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin was elected to Congress as a Democrat in 1980. But he
switched parties in 1995, when Republicans took control of the House,
after securing a promise from GOP leaders that he would preserve his
seniority on the commerce committee.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin then lobbied heavily to win its chairmanship, competing
with lifelong Republican Michael G. Oxley of Ohio. In a compromise
crafted by GOP leaders, Tauzin won the chairmanship last year but had
to cede some of the committee's turf to a new Financial Services
Committee chaired by Oxley.</TE>
<TE>   His staff is seasoned on scandal investigations, having led
headline-generating inquiries into the California energy crisis and
the Firestone tire recall.</TE>
<TE>   "We took [Ford and Firestone] to the woodshed," said Ken Johnson,
spokesman for Tauzin on the committee. "Right now both Enron and
Andersen are in line for a good old-fashioned spanking too."</TE>

<LD>Re "A Son Has Been Waiting 26 Years for Justice," Jan. 17: Columnist
Steve Lopez and Jon Opsahl have it wrong. It is not the function of
the justice system to provide therapy or vengeance to Jon Opsahl or
even to focus on his slain mother, Myrna Opsahl. That is the function
of the civil courts. The job of the criminal justice system is to
keep our society safe. I defy anyone to tell me how our society is
any safer if Sara Jane Olson, Bill Harris, Emily Harris (Montague) or
Michael Bortin are put in prison for the rest of their lives.</LD>
<LD>   I also don't understand why it is therapeutic and satisfying for
Jon Opsahl to be an instrument for taking parents away from their
children. Does it make his loss any less painful to know that he has
inflicted that same pain on other children? Vengeance is for God, not
for Jon Upsahl or even for the criminal courts.</LD>

<TE>   Re "4 SLA Figures Arrested in '75 Bank Slaying," Jan. 17: Hurrah,
three more former members of the Symbionese Liberation Army [and Sara
Jane Olson] were arrested in connection with a murderous 1975 bank
robbery. I find it bizarre how so many normal-looking people continue
to make the same kind of sappy-headed statements that were made
during SLA member Olson's case: "Oh, they were just trying to live
normal lives."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, remember how the world discovered that a lot of former Nazi
SS officers had escaped capture and had attempted to live normal
lives? That didn't abrogate their crimes. Pass the matching
bracelets, officers. Job well done!</TE>

<TE>   An innocent's brutal murder should never be swept under the carpet
of time and progress. That said, let's not rush to paint the current
SLA suspects as unrecognizable faces of pure evil. Our country was
being swept up in a costly, perverse and dishonest war, we were being
lied to on a daily basis by our military and government and three
decent voices of hope had been extinguished--not by trumped up
scandal and innuendo this time, but by assassins' bullets. It seemed
that the very soul of this country, born out of revolution, had been
corrupted to the side of business and establishment abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Washington, Paine and Franklin, the SLA revolutionaries
lacked vision, competence or judgment. The result was a miserable and
pathetic tragedy for which they must be held to account. But I will
not condemn the spirit of resistance to a government no longer, of,
for or by the people.</TE>

<LD>Re "Pakistan's Moderation," editorial, Jan. 15: Your thoughtful
critique of the Kashmir situation is both pragmatic and succinct.
Pakistan's claim over any part of Kashmir amounts to a rape of
history. It's unfortunate that India remains divided in a
self-destructive quagmire of post-colonial politics. The people of
India and Pakistan must rethink the blunders of a painful past and
construct a new United States of India. This will promote enduring
peace and equality. Even internationalization of the so-called Line
of Control is not going to undo the horrors of history.</LD>

<LD>Regarding the fatal accident on the 710 on Jan. 17: I use the 710
Freeway for my commute to work every day. There is not one single day
that I don't see at least one semi truck traveling at 70 miles per
hour, cutting in front of others (including other trucks) or not
allowing other drivers to merge in from the onramps. And yet very
rarely do I see a highway patrol car in the whole stretch from Long
Beach to Alhambra. Since the CHP seems unable to slow down these
trucks, perhaps we should have a private company handling the job.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bush Hears Local Voices--When It Suits His Agenda," Commentary,
Jan. 16: John Balzar rightly illuminates the president's double
standard on states' rights but uses the issue too much as an attack
against President Bush without emphasizing the damage these oil rigs
will cause. Although I am a Democrat, it should be noted that
development on these leases first occurred in 1999 during President
Clinton's term.</LD>
<LD>   In June, with the support of Californian environmental groups like
CalPIRG, the state of California won its court case against the
federal government mandating that California must be consulted about
any new rigs built off its shores. Each one of the these rigs will
drill scores of wells, and with each well the production will dump
toxic metals like lead and mercury into our ocean.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of the Interior released a study a few years
ago demonstrating a 94% chance of a major oil spill in Southern
California in the next three decades. Yet despite these dangers and
the president's rhetoric about states' rights, Interior Secretary
Gale Norton has appealed the court's decision to let California
decide about its own coasts. California has repeatedly rejected
building new oil rigs, and the Department of the Interior is
attempting a backhanded route to serve corporate oil interests at the
expense of California's environment and public health. Californians
need to make their voices heard to their representatives and the
Interior Department to protect our already damaged coastline from
becoming even worse.</TE>

<TE>   I am in complete accord with Balzar that the Bush administration's
high esteem for local decision-making is based on profit, not
principle. Not only does this administration cater to the whims of
industry regarding the use of our public lands but it also proposes
the overly simplistic solution of multiple use as a panacea. While
some recreational activities on our public lands are compatible with
wildlife, most industrial uses are not. Bush administration
officials' failure to acknowledge this fact demonstrates their
disregard for the environment.</TE>

<LD>Re "Violence Breeds Violence," Commentary, Jan. 16: Ellen Goodman's
observations reminded me of my own findings in assisting victims of
domestic violence in their effort to obtain restraining orders
against their abusers. (I am a volunteer with the L.A. County Bar
Assn.'s Barristers Domestic Violence Project.)</LD>
<LD>   Those seeking a temporary restraining order in Los Angeles County
Superior Court are forced to wait for hours to get the assistance
necessary to complete and file the forms. Frequently, they bring
their young children, who become tired, hungry and bored. Too often,
when the children become boisterous and out of control, their
frustrated parents strike, pinch or shove them. The very violence
that has brought the victim to court is being passed on to the child.
And so the cycle continues.</LD>

<LD>Re "California to Number Exits on Freeways," Jan. 16: A great idea,
long overdue! But why not add another improvement? As approaching
exits are shown, mark them not only with their numbers but also with
an indicator as to whether the exits will occur on the left or right
side of the freeway. I have seen many motorists cross lanes
dangerously, or cause unnecessary traffic delays, because they
suddenly realized they were in the wrong lane for exiting.</LD>
<LD>   I have seen such indicators only rarely. They should also be
placed on surface street signs pointing to a freeway onramp. I am
sure many surface street accidents have been caused by similar
confusions.</LD>

<HD>The Eloise of L.A. Revels in a Grand Past</HD>
<DH>Luxury surrounded Carlyn Benjamin in her childhood home,
the Ambassador.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I am a city child. I live at The Plaza.... I spend an awful lot of
time in the lobby. For instance every day I have to go to the Desk
Clerk and see what's happening there..." --From Kay Thompson's
"Eloise"</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Almost 50 years ago, a fictional 6-year-old imp named Eloise first
captivated children with her fanciful life at The Plaza in New York.
Over the decades, little girls read of her escapades and imagined the
excitement and adventure of living in a grand hotel. But one little
girl didn't have to dream about it. She lived it.</LD>
<TE>   As the daughter and granddaughter of the first general managers of
the famed Ambassador in Los Angeles, Carlyn Frank Benjamin grew up in
the once-luxurious hotel. And like Eloise, she knew every nook and
cranny, every bell captain and desk clerk. Room service? A way of
life.</TE>
<TE>   Now "80 going on 39," widowed and living in Brentwood, Benjamin is
working on a memoir about her days at the Ambassador--tentatively
titled "Life With Reservations."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District closed escrow on the hotel
in December, and now its future is uncertain. While conservationists
fight to save the building, which was designed by Myron Hunt, the
architect of the Rose Bowl and Huntington Library, the school
district is deciding on the best use of the site. Benjamin hopes that
somehow the hotel will be saved. "It's part of Los Angeles history
and ... my family's history," the place where she spent her
childhood, from infancy to age 17.</TE>
<TE>   Eloise lived on the top floor of The Plaza. Carlyn Frank, her
parents and younger sister, Jackie, lived on the top floor of Rincon,
a tile-roofed cottage on the grounds of the hotel, which was managed
first by her grandfather Abe, later by her father, Ben, both of whom
were hired in 1921 for the hotel's opening. It was Abe Frank who
created the Cocoanut Grove, the hotel's fabled gathering place of the
rich and famous.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent day, Benjamin makes a bittersweet visit to the
decaying 500-room hotel, which closed in 1989. Walking up the cracked
concrete steps leading to Rincon, she recalls, "This is where I had
my third birthday party. We sat on these steps and blew bubbles." The
walkway in front is where silent screen star Pola Negri used to
exercise her pet cheetah. Next door lived gossip king Walter Winchell
and his family.</TE>
<TE>   The Rincon, fallen into disrepair--with the added insult of having
been once used by the Los Angeles Police Department SWAT team to
practice raids on crack houses--is a forlorn sight with its tattered
screens, punched-out walls, peeling paint and plaster. It is hard to
imagine the living room as Benjamin remembers it, with a baby grand
piano in one corner.</TE>
<TE>   Entering the master bedroom, where a window is boarded up and a
vine has pushed its way inside, it is apparent Benjamin is a bit
shaken. For her, every room holds a memory. There was the sun-filled
den--"This is where I was sitting during the 1933 earthquake."
Surveying the state of the room, she adds, "It looks like it just
happened." And there was her bedroom and her sister's, both with
porches overlooking the hotel. Once, there were striped awnings, a
swing and a caged myna bird. "From here you could see the neon sign
on the Cocoanut Grove."</TE>
<TE>   She peers through dirty windows to the bungalow's overgrown
backyard. "I had a three-room playhouse down there, with running
water, electricity, a little baby grand piano," built for her by the
hotel's groundskeeper.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Ooooooooo I absolutely love Room Service... Rene always says,
'Bonjour, Eloise, voici votre petit de'jeuner' ... and I always say,
'Bonjour, Rene,' merci and charge it please." --"Eloise"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For little Carlyn, room service was just the way people ate. No
big deal. Indeed, her mother at one point tired of it and converted
one of Rincon's baths into a tiny kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was little," Benjamin remembers, "I'd sign checks in the
coffee shop. I didn't know you paid money for food." Later, she and
her friends would "all go to the Fountain Room and order chocolate
sodas ... and turkey sandwiches with Russian dressing, made with real
caviar, not lumpfish. I learned to love caviar when I was very
young."</TE>
<TE>   When a hotel is your home, there are other perks. For one, a
housekeeper makes your bed. "I had three clean sheets every day," one
just to cover the blanket. "That's the thing I missed most when we
moved."</TE>
<TE>   She had the run of the hotel, and she made the most of it, often
hanging out with the doormen at the auto entrance "to see who was
checking in and checking out." A who's who of old-time Hollywood were
hotel guests or residents. Marion Davies and newspaper scion William
Randolph Hearst lived there for a year. (It's said that Davies once
rode a white horse through the hotel's vast lobby en route to a
costume party. Lore also has it that F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald
made a bonfire of the furniture in their room. Benjamin knows of
neither account firsthand.)</TE>
<TE>   Guest Howard Hughes loved to rumba in the Cocoanut Grove. Charlie
Chaplin was a regular guest, as was Jean Harlow. Eastern
society--Vanderbilts, Du Ponts--wintered there. Presidents and
royalty checked in. But today it is perhaps best known as the place
where Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated on the night he
triumphed over Sen. Eugene McCarthy in the California presidential
primary on June 5, 1968.</TE>
<TE>   The Casino shopping arcade stands abandoned, but Benjamin can
point out where every shop once stood when the Ambassador, often
referred to in print as "The World Famous Ambassador," was a
miniature city. Attending to guests' whims and wishes were chic
boutiques, a post office, a travel agent, a psychic, a dentist, a
surgeon, a portrait painter, a piano teacher, a tailor and Professor
Miggle, a hair rejuvenator.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "My day is rawther full. I have to call the Valet and tell him to
get up here and pick up my sneakers to be cleaned and pressed. ...
Then I have to go down to help the switchboard operator. ... "
--"Eloise"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ambassador's head switchboard operator was Goldie, who worked
out of a small windowless room. Young Carlyn came by often. "She knew
everything that was going on in the hotel. And on weekends she'd
connect me with my girlfriends on conference calls."</TE>
<TE>   The Ambassador's rather grand movie theater, which on a recent day
was set up as a nightclub for a film shoot, was another of young
Carlyn's regular haunts. "I knew how to turn the Wurlitzer on," which
never failed to impress her friends. Top movies of the day were 25
cents for hotel guests--and included a singalong with a bouncing
ball--10 cents for children, and free for Carlyn, whose father
succeeded his father as general manager in the late 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   The big outdoor pool was Carlyn's favorite summer place. There,
Fred Cady, who coached several U.S. Olympic teams, taught her to
swim, holding a long pole to which she was attached with a leather
belt. She was fascinated by the house portrait artist, Josef Segall.
When he moved in, he sneaked his pet lion up to his room in the
service elevator. Benjamin recalls, "When the scent started coming
out into the hall, my father became aware of it. He built him a cage
in back of the tennis courts. That was the start of a zoo. We ended
up with bears, two fawns, an anteater, a swan and two parrots. Segall
sat in the cage every afternoon reading, with the lion lying at his
feet. I don't think it had any teeth."</TE>
<TE>   Off the lobby was the "doll room," where she'd often watch the
staff of women whose job was to make the celebrity look-alike dolls
as centerpieces for Tuesday's star nights at the Grove, when it was
reserved for A-list stars.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Then I scamper to the Terrace Room, where those debutantes are
prancing around. ... " --"Eloise"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carlyn Frank's Terrace Room was the Cocoanut Grove, with its fake
palms, said to have been rescued from an Oxnard beach where they had
been used in filming Rudolph Valentino's "The Sheik."</TE>
<TE>   The place to be seen from its opening in 1921, the Grove had lost
its luster by the '60s and in the '70s suffered the insult of a Las
Vegas-like make-over under the direction of Sammy Davis Jr. It never
was the same and closed in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   But, for Benjamin, memories of the original Grove are fresh.
Guests would enter through etched-glass, down red-carpeted stairs.
"There was a waterfall in the center of the back wall, and there was
a moon." Pointing at some windows near the ceiling, she said, "See up
there? That was the engineers' booth, where I used to hang out to see
what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   John Barrymore brought a real monkey to the Grove, where fake
monkeys with electric eyes hung from the fake palms. Marlene Dietrich
was sighted at a table one night wearing an orange suit with black
monkey fur epaulets. One of the early acts was Bing Crosby and the
Rhythm Boys. Benjamin says, "My father took Bing out of the Rhythm
Boys and put him up as a solo act. The trio was making $300 a week."</TE>
<TE>   In the former Zinnia Room off the lobby, Carlyn attended Miss
Klarkquist's cotillions. In those days, young ladies bought their
gowns on the fourth floor of nearby Bullock's Wilshire and, Benjamin
remembers, "One night we all showed up in the same dress in different
colors."</TE>
<TE>   To Benjamin, the French Room, later renamed the Royal Ambassador
Restaurant, will always be "where I met [Charles] Lindbergh. He came
walking down the hall, this tall blond hero. My father introduced me,
and he shook my hand." It was 1927, after Lindbergh's Paris flight.</TE>
<TE>   The lobby was always abuzz with activity. On the night of the 1933
quake, Benjamin says, "The guests and all the people from the
surrounding area came and spent the night there. Everyone stayed up
all night, listening to the music of the house orchestra. There was a
buffet set out in the lobby." The hotel suffered very little damage.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing remains of the Lido Gardens, once located near the
swimming pool. There, Ben Frank installed a dance floor and
bandstand.</TE>
<TE>   "When it wasn't being used," Benjamin says, "I could use the dance
floor for roller skating."</TE>
<TE>   West of the pool stood a huge auditorium--now a parking lot--where
horse shows were held. There was an indoor tennis court, where she
played on rainy days.</TE>
<TE>   And there were always children around. Her classmates from Third
Street School, then John Burroughs Middle School and later Los
Angeles High, came to eat and swim and play in her private clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 17, her father and the hotel parted ways and the
family moved to a real home on Highland Avenue. Carlyn Frank was no
longer "queen of the hill." Ben Frank went on to other
enterprises--including Ben Frank's toasters-on-every-table coffee
shops, and died in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 19, she met Ben Benjamin, then manager of the Roos
Bros. sportswear store in Hollywood. They married five years later
and had two children. Benjamin, who died in 1991, became a top
Hollywood talent agent.</TE>
<TE>   There are those who trace the hotel's demise to the Kennedy
assassination, but several factors led to its decline, including the
general downward spiral of the neighborhood and the migration of the
Beautiful People to the Westside. Gradually, the Ambassador fell into
disrepair. Today, it is a botch of Band-Aid renovations. A mustiness
permeates the rooms. Cheap furniture dots the lobby. Gone are the
white sand beach and cabanas.</TE>
<TE>   Once, says Carlyn Frank Benjamin, "It was caviar."</TE>
<TE>   A community meeting will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday at Virgil
Middle School, 152 N. Vermont Ave., on the best use of the property.</TE>

<HD>A Blossoming Bohemia</HD>
<DH>Lured by good rents and a kicky nightlife, artsy types are
moving to Koreatown. But low-income residents are being forced out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two and a half years ago, Jason Lucas, who had moved to Los Angeles
from Ohio to pursue a career as a furniture designer, was looking for
a place to live. He wanted a reasonably priced apartment with lots of
space in which to craft his unusual pieces--tables and chairs
suspended by cables from the ceiling. He checked out the artsy
enclaves of Silverlake and Los Feliz but found them "a little too
trendy."</LD>
<LD>   Lucas, 26, ended up in Koreatown. He pays $1,050 a month for a
one-bedroom apartment in a building called the DuBarry, one of many
refurbished Art Deco-style apartment buildings in the bustling
multi-ethnic neighborhood near downtown. It wasn't just the
affordable rent that appealed to Lucas. Koreatown's diversity was a
big selling point. "I would kill myself if I lived in the suburbs,"
he said.</LD>
<LD>   Here, few signs advertise in English, most businesses cater to
Korean and Central American tastes. Although street crime is a
drawback and the population density rivals that of Manhattan, Lucas
loves his neighborhood. And just a few months ago, his sister, 24,
and his musician brother, 22, rented places nearby.</LD>
<TE>   A new bohemia is just beginning to take root in Koreatown. Lured
by the area's affordable rents and architecturally grand apartment
buildings, the starving artist set is moving in and signs of
gentrification are emerging. Rents in the area are climbing, in some
buildings as much as 200% in three years. Two Starbucks and a
Wal-Mart recently moved in. And beyond the vibrant Korean American
nightlife, there is a young singles scene anchored by the Wiltern
Theatre, a few Internet cafes and several low-profile bars with
generous drinks and late-night hours.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 100,000 residents and thousands more commuters
occupying about 21/2 square miles, Koreatown is one of the most
densely populated neighborhoods in the nation. Most of the area's
residents are immigrants from Korea, Guatemala, El Salvador and
Nicaragua. In 1990, according to census figures, Koreatown's
population was 27.5% Asian, 51.1% Latino, 11.2% white and 6.4% black.
Ten years later, the breakdown was 29.9% Asian, 51.7% Latino, 6.6%
white and 4.7% black. Roughly, its geographical boundaries are
Beverly Boulevard on the north, San Marino Street on the south,
Western Avenue on the west and Hoover Street on the east.</TE>
<TE>   But while Koreatown's growing cachet may be good news for business
owners who are struggling to keep the area commercially viable, many
low-income families in Koreatown are being pushed out of a
neighborhood that in recent years has offered immigrants a toehold in
a new land. About three years ago, a handful of developers began to
sniff out bargains with the area's Art Deco apartment buildings.
That's when San Francisco developer Andrew Meieran of Albion Pacific
and his partner, the Michigan-based real estate company Seligman
Western Enterprises, bought 16 apartment buildings clustered around
the Ambassador Hotel for $50 million. Since then, Meieran, who is
passionate about preserving the area's signature architecture, has
acquired 22 more. Some of the buildings had fallen into such
disrepair that city officials were threatening to condemn them. Now,
Meieran, 34, and his partners are renovating them slowly with hopes
of drawing more young professionals to Koreatown.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, Meieran admits that some low-income families have
been displaced. As units are vacated, he refurbishes them and hikes
the rents, typically out-pricing the tenants who had previously lived
there. "We want a changing demographic," Meieran said. "It comes
about entirely naturally. We don't do very heavy advertising."
Instead, he said, he relies on word of mouth to attract new tenants.</TE>
<TE>   That's how singer-songwriter Linda Mark found her place in
Koreatown. A year ago, the 26-year-old Boston transplant moved to an
old building on South Hobart Boulevard because she wanted a cheap
apartment that wasn't one of the "new generic dentist office-looking
buildings," she said. And she likes living "in a part of town where
it's not all about money and looks."</TE>
<TE>   She pays $500 a month for a studio apartment, utilities included.
During the last year, her landlord has evicted troublesome tenants,
repainted the units and decorated the place with plants. "The thing
about this building is that there are a lot of creative types in
here, and everyone has different careers, and they all kind of work
with each other a bit," she said. One of her neighbors is a fashion
designer and has helped Mark put together clothes for her
performances.</TE>
<TE>   The city's original Koreatown existed south of where it is today,
spread along Jefferson Boulevard in the 1930s. But by the early
1970s, the population moved north to Olympic and Harvard boulevards
after a large Korean market opened there. Signs designating that area
Koreatown went up a few years later.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1920s and 1930s, the area was one of the city's most
fashionable. At its chic heart was the Ambassador Hotel, which opened
in 1921, surrounded by barley fields. But not for long. "It was the
catalyst for the economic growth of Wilshire Boulevard and the
residential community that grew up around it," said Ken Bernstein of
the Los Angeles Conservancy. "Those grandiose residential buildings
were in a way made possible by the success of the Ambassador."</TE>
<TE>   The hotel was a star magnet. In the 1930s, Jean Harlow held her
wedding reception at the Ambassador when she married MGM producer
Paul Bern. Clark Gable and Carole Lombard were living in the
neighborhood when they met. John Barrymore had an apartment at the
Gaylord on Wilshire Boulevard. In the late 1940s, then-Screen Actors
Guild President Ronald Reagan lived in the luxury Langham apartments
on South Normandie, known for its rooftop swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Langham's current tenants is USC senior Brigette Young.
Her studio apartment is close to the subway and the coffeehouses and
bars on Wilshire Boulevard. "Anything you can think of is within 10
minutes of here," she said. "This is right in the middle of
everything."</TE>
<TE>   For Young, 21, the music director of the college station KSCR, the
neighborhood had more character than USC's campus housing and offered
her better access to the Hollywood music scene.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks away guitarist Theodore Liscinski, 30, rents a studio
at the DuBarry on Catalina Avenue. He moved there two years ago from
the edgy New York neighborhood of Washington Heights because he won a
role in last year's film "Hedwig and the Angry Inch." California's
temperate weather and Koreatown's cheap rents persuaded him to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Tenants at the DuBarry relinquish most modern amenities including
central heating and air conditioning. But for $900 a month, they get
a bright, roomy apartment with a view of the Hollywood sign. "It's
not spectacular," Liscinski said of his neighborhood. "But there are
things to do. The [H.M.S.] Bounty is around the corner, if I feel
like having a drink. There's an Internet cafe on Normandie and
Wilshire. There's a 7-Eleven close by and a Thai place I go to every
week to get takeout."</TE>
<TE>   The nautical-themed H.M.S. Bounty on Wilshire Boulevard on the
first floor of the Gaylord building is a local watering hole for many
of the neighborhood's up-and-coming artists. They're drawn by the
dimly lit bar's red vinyl booths and generous martinis. Gaylord
tenants kill time at the bar while doing laundry on the building's
basement floor. Matt Dillon, Drew Barrymore and Winona Ryder have
been known to stop by.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Joe Falasca moved to the Gaylord from Brooklyn about a month
ago. He cherishes his ninth-floor one-bedroom (rent: $1,000) and
boasts that the place was once occupied by John Barrymore. "It had
the real city feel that I wanted and that old hotel elegance," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Until the early 1980s, this section of Wilshire Boulevard was
dominated by large oil and insurance companies. Gradually, those
businesses started moving downtown and to the Westside. In 1989, as
the economy soured, the Ambassador Hotel was shuttered and the
community took a big fiscal hit. Area merchants suffered while
conservationists, developers and city officials fought to gain
control of the hotel. In December, the Los Angeles Unified School
District ended years of legal wrangling and closed a deal to buy the
building and its grounds.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, the area was ravaged by rioting; scores of Korean-owned
businesses were looted and set ablaze. Many Koreans lost their
businesses, and some moved away. "This area was largely abandoned [by
police] during the riots," California Center Bank President Seon Hong
Kim said. "I still have very bad memories of it."</TE>
<TE>   Koreatown's commercial exodus was further fueled by damage caused
by the 1994 Northridge earthquake and Metro Rail construction in the
early to mid-1990s. During this period, apartment buildings emptied
and rents dropped. Low-income Latino families were drawn to the area
by its more affordable rents and easy access to public
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   About this time, property owners started a business-improvement
district to revitalize the area. Trees were planted in medians along
Wilshire Boulevard and planters sprouted along sidewalks. Slowly, the
area recovered as small, predominantly Korean businesses took over
the empty high-rise office buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those Wilshire Boulevard buildings were leased by local
and foreign government agencies. Consulates representing the
Philippines, Indonesia, Poland, El Salvador, Peru and the Caribbean
nations all have a presence in the area.</TE>
<TE>   This expanding diversity has obscured the recent influx of young
artists, who are predominantly white, said Charles Kim, executive
director of the Korean American Coalition, a national advocacy group
headquartered in Koreatown.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've even noticed that they're coming to
Koreatown," he said. Although gentrification has caused a backlash in
other neighborhoods, such as Santa Monica and Venice, Koreatown isn't
likely to experience the same tension, Kim said. "This is a place
where we can add all different kinds of culture," he said,
"especially if they're artists."</TE>
<TE>   After a difficult decade, the Korean business community perceives
new residents as good for business, said California Center Bank's
Seon Hong Kim.</TE>
<TE>   "My company has spent a lot of money on business development [in
Koreatown]," he said. "We really need a return from that investment."</TE>
<TE>   Some residents are less enthusiastic. Latino families make up the
majority of tenants occupying the older buildings in Koreatown. For
many Central American immigrants, the area is appealing because
housing, jobs and transportation are all within walking distance. If
rents double, said Carlos Vaquerano, executive director of the
Salvadoran American Leadership and Educational Fund, low-income
Latinos "will have to leave.... We don't have the resources Koreans
do."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, developer Meieran clashed with some of his Latino
tenants. Late last year, he purchased a building on Berendo Street,
where singles rented for as low as $250. After a tour of the building
with a fire inspector, Meieran removed an elaborate candle-lit shrine
to the Virgin Mary erected by tenants in the lobby. The tenants were
outraged, he said, because the shrine had become a community
touchstone. He further angered tenants when he fired the building
manager because she spoke only Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem here is a matter of culture," said Eduardo Rodriguez
of the Assn. of Salvadorans of Los Angeles. "You have to respect the
culture of people. The problem with gentrification is that it doesn't
take into account what people feel, what people think. It's just
about money."</TE>
<TE>   "It's problematic," Meieran said. "We don't want to displace
people ... but at the same time you want to spend the money to
upgrade the building, so it's difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, he planted grass in front of the Berendo building where
there was only dirt and removed a sidewalk taco stand built by a
local vendor. A single in the refurbished building will go for $750 a
month. "In three months," Meieran said, "you won't recognize the
place."</TE>

<LD>The first time Sossi Demirdjian sat with her son in court, the infant
Michael was in her arms and she was beaming as a judge pronounced her
and husband, Gary, the legal parents of their adopted child.</LD>
<LD>   Sixteen years later, they were back in court with Michael last
week. But this time, he was seated next to his lawyer, wearing a red
jumpsuit from county jail. And his mother was sobbing into a napkin,
as her only child was declared "vicious and evil," a murderer
sentenced to life in prison for beating to death two of his friends.</LD>
<LD>   How, I wondered, do you get from there to here? What happens in
the lives of suburban kids of privilege to lead to such heartbreaking
ends?</LD>
<TE>   The answers, it seems, are as complicated as the messy, confusing
world that we are raising our children in.</TE>
<TE>   It is the kind of story--full of violence and grief and pain--that
makes parents shudder as they watch their own teenagers treading the
stormy waters of adolescence today. Two La Crescenta boys--Chris
McCulloch, 13, and Blaine Talmo Jr., 14--out of school for the summer
and running the streets. Skateboarding, crashing at the homes of
friends, shooting hoops ... "good kids," their friends called them,
having a good time, albeit with a tad too much freedom and too little
sense of their own vulnerability.</TE>
<TE>   Their bodies were discovered one weekend in July 2000 on a school
playground in their neighborhood. They had been beaten to death with
a rock and a concrete bench, in what police would later call a
dispute over a marijuana deal gone bad. Police arrested their former
schoolmate, Michael Demirdjian, then just 15 years old. After two
trials--the first produced a hung jury--he was convicted of both
murders last fall and sentenced to two life terms, without chance of
parole.</TE>
<TE>   The saga was troubling on several fronts. How could the dead boys,
just out of middle school, have had so little supervision that they
could be away from home for days without their parents' knowing where
they were? How could a shy, quiet kid with devoted parents commit
such a brutal crime? How could a peaceful, upscale suburb, known for
the quality of its schools and its close-knit neighborhoods, be the
setting for such violence?</TE>
<TE>   It is simple to blame drugs; marijuana is indeed often the tie
that binds kids to tragedy. It is tempting to blame naive or
neglectful parents, who leave kids to fend for themselves too much.
And it is easy to see that a toxic culture--one that glamorizes
drugs, violence and thuggery--is helping to shape our children's
perceptions and their fate.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we should also blame our illusions ... the notion that we
know our kids, that we really understand their issues. The fantasy
that they are coming up in a world as predictable as the one that we
recall, and that we can set its boundaries with the right combination
of freedom and control.</TE>
<TE>   But little about child-rearing is ever as clear as we would like
it to be. Everyone knows of kids who, despite caring families,
inexplicably veered off track; and of children who grew up in
dysfunctional homes and still managed to find success. Even "good"
kids can do stupid, terrible things, wind up behind bars or dead,
leave their parents wondering, did I do too much or not enough?</TE>
<TE>   "I used to stand outside his room," Sossi Demirdjian told me after
the sentencing, "and listen through his bedroom door" when her son
Michael got late-night phone calls. She made sure he was in his room
at night, but found out later, after his arrest, that he sometimes
sneaked out through his window.</TE>
<TE>   "My son, he made some mistakes," she said. "But he was a good kid.
And I make mistakes too."</TE>
<TE>   The families of the dead boys must have questions that will go
eternally unanswered as well. At the funeral of her son, Chris,
Aileen Bristow told of her frustration trying to corral her wayward
child. "It was like he was in a hurry," she said. He'd be gone with
his friends for days, coming home only long enough to get a few
hours' sleep and change his clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of you are probably asking 'Why didn't you stop him?' God
knows I tried."</TE>
<TE>   If there's a formula for raising good kids, Sossi Demirdjian
thought she was following it. There was "Mommy and Me" when Mike was
a baby. Private school until junior high. Soccer and hockey and
basketball, with his parents there to watch him play. Help with
homework, family vacations, visits to Disneyland with friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Always, we were with him," she says. "Maybe we didn't always
understand, but we always gave him love."</TE>
<TE>   Now her son--who, even as a teenager, was too shy to sleep at the
home of a friend--will spend every night for the rest of his life
locked away in a prison cell. And Michael's mother and father--who
have never gotten so much as a traffic ticket--will be forever known
as the parents of a murderer and never see their son again outside of
a prison visiting room.</TE>
<TE>   But they are better off than the parents of Chris and Blaine, who
tried just as hard--and failed just as painfully--to usher their sons
safely through adolescence. They can only visit their children's
graves.</TE>

<SM>COVER: They were "good kids" from good families living in a
good neighborhood with good schools. So why did two of them wind up
beaten to death and the other in prison for life for killing them?
There are no easy answer, and that is the frightening part for
parents.</SM>

<LD>Annenberg Tribute</LD>
<LD>   Calling her a woman who has "given a lifetime of service to
others," former President Gerald R. Ford presented Leonore Annenberg
with the inaugural Pat Nixon Ambassador of Goodwill Award at a
benefit netting $175,000 for the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace
in Yorba Linda.</LD>
<LD>   Annenberg, U.S. chief of protocol under President Reagan and wife
of diplomat and publishing magnate Walter H. Annenberg (who was
unable to attend the gala), thanked Ford and went on to praise her
friend, Pat Nixon, who died in 1993: "She was a global ambassador of
goodwill, representing the United States with dignity and poise."</LD>
<TE>   The same could be said of Annenberg, observed Julie Nixon
Eisenhower, who worked with the library to create the new award in
honor of her mother.</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Annenberg is a great diplomat. She has represented America
in the Court of St. James [when her husband was ambassador] and in
her humanitarian efforts in medicine, education and the arts."</TE>
<TE>   About 350 guests, including former President Richard M. Nixon's
brother, Edward Nixon, former Secretary of State George P. Shultz and
David Eisenhower, dined on grilled filet of beef with truffle sauce
at tables decorated with bouquets of yellow roses--Pat Nixon's
favorite flower.</TE>
<TE>   Also attending the Jan. 9 event, which marked what would have been
Richard Nixon's 89th birthday: Betty Ford, Pete Wilson, Nixon library
board chairman Donald L. Bendetti and his wife Dorothy, Gaddi
Vasquez, Gerald R. Parsky, Julia "Judie" Argyros, Judith Rodin,
Katherine B. Loker, John Argue and John Barr.</TE>

<LD>As mother loaded the dishwasher, she asked, "Jeffrey, what would you
like for your birthday?"</LD>
<LD>   "I would like," said Jeffrey, "a real jet black horse with a
silver saddle and bridle. I would ride him to school every day."</LD>
<LD>   "But do they have hay at the cafeteria?" his mother asked.</LD>
<TE>   "Hmmmm," said Jeffrey, thoughtfully.</TE>
<TE>   "What else would you like?"</TE>
<TE>   "A real train," said Jeffrey, "with a huge black engine and 100
miles of tracks. I'd take my friends clear across the mountains."</TE>
<TE>   "Wouldn't it scare our dog? He might run away."</TE>
<TE>   "He's too brave--I think."</TE>
<TE>   "That's nice. What else would you like?" asked Mother.</TE>
<TE>   "A really real rocket ship to carry me and my friend to the moon."
Jeffrey went "rrrooww," as if he were blasting off.</TE>
<TE>   "Would your teacher excuse you from school to go to the moon?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'd go in the summer,'' Jeffrey smiled, proudly.</TE>
<TE>   "I see, and what else would you like?"</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey thought about a pet lion, a shark for the swimming pool, a
real live rattlesnake.</TE>
<TE>   Mother frowned and stacked dishes.</TE>
<TE>   On the night before his birthday, Jeffrey dreamed of his wonderful
wishes. Then on his birthday, he got up early. Maybe his mom and dad
would give him his present in the morning. After all, it was his
birthday!</TE>
<TE>   As he walked into the kitchen, he stopped suddenly.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, wow!" Standing right beside his chair at the table was his
birthday present. It had a big blue ribbon tied around it, and
gleamed red and silver in the sun from the window.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey ran into his mother and father's bedroom and threw his
arms around both of them. "How did you know that the most wonderful
birthday present in the whole wide world would be a real bicycle!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kay Haugaard thinks imagining big, fantastic things is nice, but
the best fun comes from real things like bicycles that we can do
things with. This story will be on The Times' Web site at

<HD>For the Poseurs of Sundance, Attitude Can Be Everything</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Text and Photos By ROBERT GAUTHIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Locals call the Hollywood elite attending the Sundance Film Festival
"PIBs,"--"People in Black." It's meant in the most derogatory sense,
but that doesn't seem to bother the herd of movie-industry types
walking along Main Street, wearing Kenneth Cole sweaters and talking
into their ultra-tiny Motorola Star-Tak phones.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, it's getting harder to spot a PIB because black seems to
be fading to gray and giving way to other colors. As the 20th annual
celebration of American independent movies ends today in this
picturesque mountain town, new fashion categories come to mind such
as "PINGs" (People in Neon Green) or "PIMPs" (People in Modified
Pink).</LD>
<LD>   Photo day at the Mountain Lodge ice rink, and a San Francisco drag
troupe is melting snow as its colorful outfits and attitude outshine
the bright midday sun. The troupe earns the "People Who Just Won't
Let Go of the '60s" award. Not far away is actress Bai Ling, melting
some snow of her own as she shows off her "ski outfit," with a
tiger-stripe print midriff top and an even shorter fur jacket with
leopard spots. Guaranteed to keep her warm as she's cutting through
the deep Park City moguls.</LD>
<TE>   Looking like the girl next door in a classic "look in your own
closet and you'll find one" sweater, actress Aimee Graham, who is in
"Bark," responds to a red-carpet type question of "Who's your sweater
by?" with, "I don't know, just make something up." Later in the week,
she's posing at the Reebok house, a cabin where filmmakers, actors
and actresses can go to get a workout, a massage, lunch and free
Reebok clothes from head to toe. It didn't take long for her to
graduate to one of the People in Free Gear. She still doesn't know
who made her sweater.</TE>
<TE>   You still see an occasional dead animal--or faux skin--warming the
obviously wealthy shoulders of a "Park City Recreator at Play" as one
of them exits the Marriott Hotel on the way to the slopes for some of
the best skiing in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the likes of the truly independent filmmaker, who
is the embodiment of the spirit of Sundance. Don Thomas, a graduate
student at San Francisco State, wears his homemade chicken outfit day
in and day out to promote his master's project, "Pedro+Tony?," his
animated love story about a dog named Pedro and his "boyfriend who
happens to be a chicken," Tony. Thomas falls into a category of his

<KH>MUSLIM WOMEN</KH>
<HD>An Identity Reduced to a Burka</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAILA AL-MARAYATI and SEMEEN ISSA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few years ago, someone from the Feminist Majority Foundation called
the Muslim Women's League to ask if she could "borrow a burka" for a
photo shoot the organization was doing to draw attention to the
plight of women in Afghanistan under the Taliban. When we told her
that we didn't have one, and that none of our Afghan friends did
either, she expressed surprise, as if she'd assumed that all Muslim
women keep burkas in their closets in case a militant Islamist comes
to dinner. She didn't seem to understand that her assumption was the
equivalent of assuming that every Latino has a Mexican sombrero in
their closet.</LD>
<LD>   We don't mean to make light of the suffering of our sisters in
Afghanistan, but the burka was--and is--not their major focus of
concern. Their priorities are more basic, like feeding their
children, becoming literate and living free from violence.
Nevertheless, recent articles in the Western media suggest the burka
means everything to Muslim women, because they routinely express
bewilderment at the fact that all Afghan women didn't cast off their
burkas when the Taliban was defeated. The Western press' obsession
with the dress of Muslim women is not surprising, however, since the
press tends to view Muslims, in general, simplistically.</LD>
<TE>   Headlines in the mainstream media have reduced Muslim female
identity to an article of clothing--"the veil." One is hard-pressed
to find an article, book or film about women in Islam that doesn't
have "veil" in the title: "Behind the Veil," "Beyond the Veil," "At
the Drop of a Veil" and more. The use of the term borders on the
absurd: Perhaps next will come "What Color is Your Veil?" or "Rebel
Without a Veil" or "Whose Veil is it, Anyway?"</TE>
<TE>   The word "veil" does not even have a universal meaning. In some
cultures, it refers to a face-covering known as niqab; in others, to
a simple head scarf, known as hijab. Other manifestations of "the
veil" include all-encompassing outer garments like the ankle-length
abaya from the Persian Gulf states, the chador in Iran or the burka
in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Like the differences in our clothing from one region to another,
Muslim women are diverse. Stereotypical assumptions about Muslim
women are as inaccurate as the assumption that all American women are
personified by the bikini-clad cast of "Baywatch." Anyone who has
spent time interacting with Muslims knows that, despite numerous
obstacles, Muslim women are active, assertive and engaged in society.
In Qatar, women make up the majority of graduate-school students. The
Iranian parliament has more women members than the U.S. Senate.
Throughout the world, many Muslim women are educated and
professionally trained; they participate in public debates, are often
catalysts for reform and champions for their own rights. At the same
time, there is no denying that in many Muslim countries, dress has
been used as a tool to wield power over women.</TE>
<TE>   What doesn't penetrate Western consciousness, however, is that
forced uncovering is also a tool of oppression. During the reign of
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in Iran, wearing the veil was prohibited.
As an expression of their opposition to his repressive regime, women
who supported the 1979 Islamic Revolution marched in the street
clothed in chadors. Many of them did not expect to have this "dress
code" institutionalized by those who led the revolution and then took
power in the new government.</TE>
<TE>   In Turkey, the secular regime considers the head scarf a symbol of
extremist elements that want to overthrow the government.
Accordingly, women who wear any type of head-covering are banned from
public office, government jobs and academia, including graduate
school. Turkish women who believe the head-covering is a religious
obligation are unfairly forced to give up public life or
opportunities for higher education and career advancement.</TE>
<TE>   Dress should not bar Muslim women from exercising their
Islam-guaranteed rights, like the right to be educated, to earn a
living and to move about safely in society. Unfortunately, some
governments impose a strict dress code along with other restrictions,
like limiting education for women, to appear "authentically Islamic."
Such laws, in fact, are inconsistent with Islam. Nevertheless, these
associations lead to the general perception that "behind the veil"
lurk other, more insidious examples of the repression of women, and
that wearing the veil somehow causes the social ills that plague
Muslim women around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Many Muslim men and women alike are subjugated by despotic,
dictatorial regimes. Their lot in life is worsened by extreme poverty
and illiteracy, two conditions that are not caused by Islam but are
sometimes exploited in the name of religion. Helping Muslim women
overcome their misery is a major task. The reconstruction of Muslim
Afghanistan will be a test case for the Afghan people and for the
international community dedicated to making Afghan society work for
everyone. To some, Islam is the root cause of the problems faced by
women in Afghanistan. But what is truly at fault is a misguided,
narrow interpretation of Islam designed to serve a rigid patriarchal
system.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional Muslim populations will be more receptive to change
that is based on Islamic principles of justice, as expressed in the
Koran, than they will be to change that abandons religion altogether
or confines it to private life. Muslim scholars and leaders who
emphasize Islamic principles that support women's rights to
education, health care, marriage and divorce, equal pay for equal
work and participation in public life could fill the vacuum now
occupied by those who impose a vision of Islam that infringes on the
rights of women.</TE>
<TE>   Given the opportunity, Muslim women, like women everywhere, will
become educated, pursue careers, strive to do what is best for their
families and contribute positively according to their abilities. How
they dress is irrelevant. It should be obvious that the critical
element Muslim women need is freedom, especially the freedom to make
choices that enable them to be independent agents of positive change.
Choosing to dress modestly, including wearing a head scarf, should be
as respected as choosing not to cover. Accusations that modestly
dressed Muslim women are caving in to male-dominated understandings
of Islam neglect the reality that most Muslim women who cover by
choice do so out of subservience to God, not to any human being.</TE>
<TE>   The worth of a woman--any woman--should not be determined by the
length of her skirt, but by the dedication, knowledge and skills she
brings to the task at hand.</TE>

<HD>The U.S. Continues Its Strategy of 'Eternal War'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC COOPER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I last visited Colombia some months back, the editor of Gabriel
Garcia Marquez's news magazine Cambio lamented that his country
seemed "ripe for eternal war." The news last week that Colombia's
sputtering "peace process" was salvaged from collapse at the last
moment does little to alter that grim assessment.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-year-old peace talks between the government and leftist
guerrillas will continue. But with no truce in place, so will the
mutual murder, mayhem and kidnapping that has turned this Andean
nation into one of the most violent places on Earth. Regrettably,
U.S. policy does nothing except accelerate and encourage the
bloodletting.</LD>
<LD>   Under its so-called Plan Colombia--a $1.3 billion, multiyear
effort pushed through in the last phase of the Clinton administration
in the name of the war on drugs--the Bush White House now pumps more
than $2 million a day into the counter-narcotics conflict. Countless
federal drug and intelligence agents act as adjuncts to the Colombian
military. A couple of hundred or more U.S. military advisors train
and counsel three new elite battalions of the Colombian army. Dozens
of hi-tech U.S. combat helicopters, including a squadron of 14
battle-ready Black Hawks, are being shipped to Bogota.</LD>
<TE>   Along with them come an unknown number of private-contract U.S.
pilots and helicopter technical crews. Another batch of
private-contract Americans fly the crop dusters that spray toxic
herbicides over the coca-rich countryside. Supporting this operation
are four new so-called "forward operating locations," or FOLs--U.S
.military intelligence outposts--in Ecuador, Aruba, Curacao and El
Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   Now word comes that the Bush administration is considering U.S.
military aid that would be earmarked, not for counter-narcotics
assistance, but for counter-insurgency, that is, for the government's
war against the guerrillas. Already last year, one U.S. Embassy
official admitted to me that the line between the two struggles is
"ambiguous." Those who have worried that U.S. intervention in the
Colombia drug war would eventually drag us directly into that
country's civil war now have genuine cause to be alarmed.</TE>
<TE>   It's no accident that Colombia is simultaneously the world's
largest cocaine producer and home to the hemisphere's most dogged
guerrilla insurgency. Both the drug trade and the guerrilla movement
have grown out of social and economic injustice endemic in rural
areas of the country. A political and economic oligarchy has
monopolized much of recent Colombia history. Disenfranchised
subsistence farmers have found in coca production their only
salvation. Others have sought a better world through armed struggle
or organized crime. And all sides have an interest in the cash-rich
coca trade.</TE>
<TE>   With a certain sense of irony and resignation, Colombians lump all
rifle-toting groups--from the army and police to various guerrilla
groups, counter-guerrilla paramilitary death squads and criminal
gangs--under the rubric of "armed actors." They might as well add the
U.S. to that roster.</TE>
<TE>   For 38 years, the guerrilla insurgency has raged. Colombian
President Andres Pastrana, whose term is up in August, has taken a
two-track approach to the crisis. While accommodating the U.S., he
has also--to his credit--aggressively pursued peace parlays with the
FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) insurgents, an
18,000-strong guerrilla army that is flush with coca dollars. To the
open dismay of U.S. officials, Pastrana granted the guerrillas a
Switzerland-sized safe haven, which has been the venue of the talks.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations have been bumpy and inconclusive. Neither side
has given very much. The government demands that rebels cease their
tactic of kidnapping and that they stop using the safe zone as a
staging area for military operations. For their part, the guerrillas
demand the government do more to reign in right-wing death squads,
which have carried out a string of horrific massacres.</TE>
<TE>   Then last week, Pastrana stiffened. Giving the rebels a 48-hour
ultimatum, he demanded they either meet a series of his demands or
abandon the safe haven and face a large military offensive.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimatums from any side hardly seem the remedy for what ails
Colombia. In order to achieve a lasting peace, all "actors" in the
conflict will have to make concessions of sizable proportions. The
guerrillas will have to recognize that while their call for social
justice widely resonates in Colombia, their real political support is
narrow and weak because most Colombians are appalled by their
involvement in the coca industry and are horrified by their use of
often barbaric military tactics. As a result, the guerrillas have no
future other than as one more political party.</TE>
<TE>   On the government side, Pastrana will have to show some real grit
in confronting and eliminating the right-wing death squads that often
work as allies with the army. But more important, Pastrana will have
to make what Italian leftist politicians call the "historic
compromise"--convincing the Colombian elites that the future of their
country rests on their willingness to accept radical economic and
social reforms that close the gaping class divide that rends the
nation weak and keeps it at war with itself.</TE>
<TE>   For all this to work, the U.S. would have to scale down its
current military posture and redirect its military assistance to
economic development. But that possibility seems as distant as the
other two. Few Colombians failed to see the stark symbolism in the
fact that Pastrana's ultimatum last week came just one day after an
elaborate ceremony was staged to receive the latest shipment of U.S.
Black Hawk gunships, during which U.S. Ambassador Anne W. Patterson
renewed the U.S. pledge to provide military support. To underscore
the hard-line U.S. policy, the White House last week made a "recess
appointment" of ultra-hawk Otto J. Reich as assistant secretary of
State for Western Hemisphere affairs. As Colombia teetered on the
abyss of all-out war, the peace talks were, nevertheless, rescued.
Round-the-clock negotiations carried out by United Nations special
envoy James LeMoyne and, at the final moment, supported by foreign
diplomats brought both sides together just four hours before the
deadline. Now Pastrana has issued another ultimatum, giving the
rebels until today to agree to a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   To the embarrassment of U.S. diplomacy, credit for salvaging the
peace process should go squarely to LeMoyne. A former New York Times
foreign correspondent, and armed with nothing more than fluent
Spanish, a working knowledge of the region and a mandate from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, LeMoyne kept the dialogue alive.</TE>
<TE>   One can only imagine what the government of the United
States--with its enormous power, wealth and prestige--could
accomplish if it followed LeMoyne's example and put all its efforts
in Colombia into the work of a lasting peace, instead of into a
seemingly endless war.</TE>

<HD>No Way to Pick a Chief</HD>
<DH>The debate about Parks' future has pitted elite blacks
against a police union. Where's the rest of the city?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE DOMANICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whose police department is it? That's the question the people of Los
Angeles should be asking themselves as the first term of Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks expires. Parks has strongly indicated that he wants
another five years as chief, a decision he's expected to make
official next month. Whether the Police Commission reappoints him or
looks elsewhere, however, seems, so far, unrelated to what the rest
of the city may want, or to what's best for the city. Instead, it's
come down to a nasty political fight with heavy racial overtones
between the city's black establishment and the department's
rank-and-file union, the Police Protective League.</LD>
<LD>   The question of de facto ownership of the Los Angeles Police
Department used to be easy to answer. It belonged to the chief of
police--to William Parker, Ed Davis and Daryl F. Gates. They ran the
department as if it were a personal fiefdom, proudly accountable to
no one, serving at their own pleasure for as long as they chose.</LD>
<TE>   Then came the videotaped beating of Rodney G. King by four LAPD
officers, the highly critical Christopher Commission report outlining
the department's misconduct, the 1992 Los Angeles riots and a
voter-approved charter amendment limiting the chief's term in office.
The chief no longer has life tenure. He is now limited to one
five-year term, after which an additional five may be requested, with
10 years being the maximum.</TE>
<TE>   During his five years as chief, Willie Williams never owned his
department. An outsider from Philadelphia, he was hostilely greeted
by the department's command staff and by newly elected Mayor Richard
Riordan, who hadn't chosen him and didn't like him. Such politically
cold treatment, combined with Williams' own erratic behavior, led to
his dismissal. The commission then chose the man who Riordan wanted
for the job--Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Parks tried to make the department his and Riordan's. But in 1999,
the Rampart police corruption scandal raised questions about Parks'
leadership, management skills and commitment to the Christopher
Commission reforms. Parks also got himself into more trouble when,
acting on principle, he opposed the Police Protective League's
flexible-workweek plan, which allows officers to work 12-hour shifts
three days a week or 10-hour shifts fours days a week. Parks did
himself further harm by implementing a disciplinary system the League
considers harsh, arbitrary and capricious--the root cause, the union
claims, for officers leaving the department by the hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   All this made Parks' reappointment an issue in last years' mayoral
campaign. Facing a tough challenge from former Assembly Speaker
Antonio Villaraigosa, then-City Atty. James K. Hahn hit on the
winning strategy of making Villaraigosa appear dangerous to
conservative white voters, of gaining the Police Protective League's
support by promising to implement its flexible-workweek plan and of
gathering up the black vote by promising African Americans a seat at
his administration's table and, in contrast to Villaraigosa, being
noncommittal about Parks' future.</TE>
<TE>   Now Hahn is caught in the middle of his two key constituencies,
and the city is paying the price.</TE>
<TE>   The battle began in late November, when the police union, after
polling its members, released a "report card" giving Parks'
leadership all Ds and Fs. In response, black leaders, including two
congresswomen and three City Council members, blasted the League and
announced their undying support for Parks. "Hahn has to do the right
thing for the whole city," asserted Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas.
"And placating the [league] is not consistent with doing what needs
to be done in the interest of public safety."</TE>
<TE>   Last Thursday, the league released the results of its latest
poll--a no-confidence vote--that, according to league director Ted
Hunt, had a "rate of return" of 68%. Of those, 93% voted "no
confidence" in Parks. "The league," said Hunt, is "willing to spend
up to $1 million to tell the people of Los Angeles that the LAPD is
mismanaged and organizationally broken....[W]orking conditions [under
Parks] are simply intolerable."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the president-elect of the black police officers'
association, the Oscar Joel Bryant Foundation, sent an open letter to
Hahn. Describing the current situation as an "internal race war,"
Ronnie Cato wrote that "the [Protective] League is determined to
convince you ... that [Parks] should not be selected for a second
term. ... They have hired a political campaign firm ... to inundate
you and the Police Commission with negative misinformation about the
chief. ... He is being targeted by a [predominately] all-white league
that has never allowed an African American to serve on its board
....[or] found anything wrong with the actions of any white officer
who has killed or beaten an African American citizen. ... The league
is making it clear that they do not want an African American chief to
tell them what to do."</TE>
<TE>   The black political elite and L.A.'s business establishment that
most vocally support Parks, and the largely white union that opposes
him, constitute far less than 1% of the city. That leaves more that
99% of the city unheard in the debate over whether Parks should be
reappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Parks is a well-connected black man; a hard-won symbol of black
political power in Los Angeles. But he's also a failed chief opposed
to fundamentally reforming his department's training methods, tactics
and attitude. Should he be reappointed chief simply because of his
race and regardless of his past performance?</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, race was--and should have been--a decisive
factor in the selection of a successor to Gates. Not only had African
Americans borne the brunt of the LAPD's violence and abuse, they had
led the fight to reform the department. It took nearly a century of
battling and a 1980 consent decree to ensure diversity within the
LAPD. But we're now entering our 10th year with a black chief. Two of
the department's eight deputy chiefs--Julius Davis and Maurice
Moore--are African Americans, as are 20% of its commanders, 11.4% of
the highest-ranking captains and about 12.6% of the highest-ranking
lieutenants. In all, black officers comprise about 13.6% of the
force, slightly more than their proportion in the city's population.</TE>
<TE>   After one of the city's worst police scandals, reform, not color,
must be the overriding issue in the selection of a new chief. Parks'
race should not protect him from his failure to overhaul the
department.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Police Protective League, it is what it is, a union,
nothing more. It exists for no other reason than to obtain the best
pay, benefits and working conditions for its members. At election
time, it provides money and support to candidates who advance its
goals. The voters of Los Angeles should realize that, and stop
allowing this relative small group of public servants to remain king
makers.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Hahn maintains that when it's time to state his opinion on
who should be chief, he'll do the right thing, unswayed by the two
groups to whom he owes his job. And he may do just that. But just in
case, the rest of the public and their representatives had better
wake up and ensure that L.A.'s next chief is the best possible person
to reform the department, not someone who's named--or not named--as a
political payback.</TE>

<LD>During his five-year tenure, Police Chief Bernard C. Parks not only
endured the department's worst police corruption scandal. He has also
managed to tick off portions of the rank-and-file, his supervisorial
staff and the community. Neighborhood watch groups didn't like him
gutting the popular senior-lead-officer program. Officers resented
his opposition to flexible workweeks. And Parks' disciplinary system
has been deemed both draconian and picayune. Still, the chief retains
support for his quieter initiatives. What follows is a sample of
opinion from people around the city on the question of granting Parks
a second term:</LD>
<LD>   "Parks should continue. He had the misfortune of having the
Rampart scandal occur during his tenure [and] ... there has been a
lot of press about low police morale, difficulty recruiting personnel
and losing officers to neighboring cities. ... [But] he has an
excellent background, he's already served five years, violent crime
is down and crime, in general, is down. If the West L.A. division was
its own city, it would be one of the safest places in America, thanks
to the efforts of the LAPD--so somebody is doing something right."</LD>
<LD>   --Larry Zehnder, president of Westside Civic Federation,
representing 17 West Los Angeles homeowner associations in
Beverlywood</LD>
<TE>   "I'm strongly recommending they don't extend Parks' contract. A
significant sample of police who work the Echo Park area consistently
tell me the primary reasons the Police Department has been unable to
boost the number of officers are the rules and regulations laid out
by the chief. ... [These rules] cause the officers to be very timid
in their approach to criminals, especially gang members. ... Parks
has been doing everything in his power to sabotage the compressed
work schedule. When he dismantled the senior lead officers, he made
very insulting remarks about how they only served a small group of
elitists. Parks is very inflexible, he won't listen to citizens and
he won't budge once he's made a decision, and that is a quality we
don't want in a chief."</TE>
<TE>   --Ron Emler, Echo Park Security Assn. (neighborhood watch group)</TE>
<TE>   "The chief should be kept on. But the issue really goes beyond any
one officer or police chief. My fear for L.A. is that no police chief
can be successful. Too many groups [like the Police Protective
League] are ready to see the city go down in a blazing ball of fire
rather than give up their vested interests. ... Until we stop playing
musical chairs with the police chief, and work together to make him
successful, the city won't prosper."</TE>
<TE>   --Patsy Carter, chairwoman, 23rd Street Neighbors at University
Park</TE>
<TE>   "I think he should continue. I don't think Parks is responsible
for Rampart [police-corruption scandal]. I know some of the
rank-and-file don't like his disciplinary methods, but he has to
stick to his guns and do what policy says he should do. He's doing
the best he can, but he has to fight [the Police Protective League]
in order to implement disciplinary matters; it seems like [the union]
just fights against him, I don't know why."</TE>
<TE>   --Lawrence D. Koonce Sr., president of 81st Street Block Club,
South-Central Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   "I think very highly of the work Chief Parks has done, and if he
were to leave, I'd be very disappointed. He has supported our center
and, in fact, has been very instrumental in advocating the rights of
sexual-assault survivors in South L.A. ... [It] has been very hard to
get police to get annual training in sexual-assault procedures [but]
now I am able to walk in and participate in [their] training. And the
officers are a lot more sensitive to issues of survivors. ... The
officers' approach to coming out and getting a report from victims
has totally changed, it's more supportive, more caring. And follow-up
is much easier."</TE>
<TE>   --Felicia Gray, program director, Rosa Parks Sexual Assault Crisis
Center, South Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   "I've admired the chief very, very much, and I'm hoping common
ground can be found over issues so he can continue. At the same time,
I have a huge problem with the morale among the rank-and-file; it's
an unhealthy tension that affects the esprit de corps. He has done a
fantastic job to bring discipline, to bring respect to the police
department, but that discipline has to be fair, meted out in equal
way. The gutting of the senior lead officers was a decision that had
a tremendous impact on how the ordinary citizen approaches the
department. Now, we have a message machine to contact the senior lead
officer; it's a very poor solution."</TE>
<TE>   --Msgr. John Moretta, Resurrection Parish, near Boyle Heights</TE>
<TE>   "Parks has done some really good things in this community, but I
don't think he should be chief of police. He doesn't let his officers
make judgments out in the field. Even for the smallest bogus
complaint, supervisors have to investigate the police officers, no
matter how fraudulent they might be. When they got rid of CRASH
units, gang activity and crime grew significantly. They should have
dealt with police officers who committed those crimes in the Rampart
scandal, but to get rid of an entire unit so essential to the L.A.
area, I don't think that was good."</TE>
<TE>   --C. Suk, Koreatown youth worker</TE>
<TE>   "He's a tremendous guy, but he needs to mend his ways. For one
thing, he can't be so stiff and militaristic in decision-making.
Apparently, he's not listening to his deputy chiefs, who keep telling
him things have got to change.... Parks ... respond to questions, but
we get the same rhetoric: We don't have the manpower and we don't
have money. What we know is the money hasn't been spent due to a lack
of good candidates for police. We're losing officers faster than
we're gaining them. ... We have better police service in our area
because we have more officers on board, but [former Police Chief]
Willie Williams should really get the credit for that, since he was
in office at that time."</TE>
<TE>   --Ross H. Valencia, chairman steering committee for Boyle Heights
Residents Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the job Parks has done. Around Woodland Hills, I've seen
improvements with police patrolling; crime's down and graffiti is
down. There's more discipline on the police force. When that thing
happened in Rampart division, the whole police force took a look into
itself and said we better clean up here."</TE>
<TE>   --Arturo Lewin, Art Lewin Clothiers, Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely, we should keep Chief Parks. We need continuity. ...
What we need to do is work with the police chief to make our streets
safer. Chief Parks ... reinstituted police walking our streets. The
officers have been wonderful about coming out and assisting us ...
they actually give the homeless our card and refer them to our
agency. They've referred homeless mothers living in their cars,
rather than arrest them or put them in jail."</TE>
<TE>   --Mary L. Gimenez-Caulder, executive director/ CEO, Harbor
Interfaith Shelter, San Pedro</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he's doing a good job, there are too many gangs,
too many murders. He's too busy being Mr. Big Shot to get anything
done. A couple of policemen I know are not happy with the way he's
doing things. He's very strict, very rigid, doesn't do what's
necessary to protect the city. He was taught by [former Police Chief]
Daryl Gates, who was the same way. Too many of the policemen are
leaving, they can't get new policemen in this city anymore, and it
takes forever to put them through the strenuous checks to see whether
they're qualified. ... There shouldn't be change for change's sake,
but if there's any possibility of it becoming better, that would be
welcome."</TE>

<LD>This has been a tough couple of weeks for Kenneth L. Lay, chairman
and chief executive officer of Enron Corp. His company's outside
auditor, Andersen, reported that thousands of e-mails and documents
related to Enron audits were shredded after federal regulators had
launched a probe into Enron's finances. Late last week, the Enron
board fired Andersen. A letter written by a company vice president
warning of an accounting "implosion" was made public. Lay's private
conversations seeking help from Bush Cabinet members were suddenly
the talk of Washington. The Justice Department announced a criminal
investigation of his company. And Enron was delisted from the New
York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   But this is also a story of real people, like Roy Rinard, a
54-year-old utility lineman with an Enron subsidiary, who will have
to work long past when he had hoped to retire. The reason? The value
of his 401(k) savings account, all invested in Enron stock, shrunk
from $472,000 to less than $4,000 after Enron declared bankruptcy. He
was helpless to stop the loss. Along with the bulk of Enron's other
employees--although not its top management--Rinard was prevented by
company rules from selling his retirement-plan stock.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Enron executives allegedly carried out a scheme that
artificially inflated the price of the company's stock and then
cashed out before bankruptcy was declared. All told, top Enron
executives and board members sold more than $1 billion in stock, all
the while assuring their employees and shareholders that all was well
at the company, according to news reports.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government is investigating, but perhaps its first
task should be to examine its own culpability in the matter,
particularly with regard to the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act, enacted by Congress in late 1995 as part of Newt Gingrich's
"contract with America."</TE>
<TE>   The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act might more accurately
be labeled the "Corporate License to Steal Act." Approved by just two
votes over a presidential veto, the law was written largely by and
for powerful corporate interests. It gutted historic safeguards
against fraud and weakened those protecting investors. It set up
legal obstacles that may have enabled Enron to hide its questionable
accounting practices. Under the law, victims must prove a fraud in
detail without access to evidentiary documents. Damages are limited.
Those collaterally responsible for a fraud like, perhaps, an
accounting firm, are protected from liability.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations in the Enron story echo some of the allegations in
suits our law firm is currently litigating or has settled since the
act was passed.</TE>
<TE>   At Waste Management Inc., insiders reaped millions of dollars of
profits while at the same time--it later became clear--the company
was falsifying profit reports. Twice in 10 years, Waste Management
had to restate previously reported earnings.</TE>
<TE>   At Cisco Systems, top executives sold nearly $600 million of their
own company stock before breaking news of serious financial problems
to investors. While they were rushing to sell their shares at prices
as high as $80 a share--more than four times its current value--the
executives misled investors about sales, inventory and profits.</TE>
<TE>   At Oracle Corp., Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Ellison dumped
nearly $900 million in stock--his first sale in five years--just
weeks before the company disclosed bleak revenue and earnings news
that sent stock plummeting more than 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Sunbeam Corp. ultimately declared bankruptcy and its stock
plummeted, but not before its chairman and chief executive, Albert J.
Dunlap, who later was found to have falsified financial reports and
destroyed a valuable brand name, managed to sell 100% of his
holdings--for more than $60 million. Enron's accounting firm,
Andersen (then known as Arthur Andersen), was also responsible for
auditing Sunbeam and recently paid $110 million to Sunbeam
shareholders to settle its liability.</TE>
<TE>   These financial tragedies, while shocking, were not totally
unexpected. A 1999 Fortune magazine article predicted just such
events, noting that "beneath corporate America's uncannily
disciplined march of profits ... lie great expanses of accounting
rot, just waiting to be revealed." Since then, U.S. investors have
lost trillions in shareholder value. As economist Ben Stein recently
put it, "It now is clear that the worst stock market debacle in the
history of post-war America did not just happen by chance or by greed
of the masses, but happened in large part because of conspiracy,
greed in high places, and a federal regulatory failure of unique
proportions."</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to Enron. Enron formed limited partnerships
that were apparently used, among other things, to keep debt off
company books. Several Enron executives, including Chief Financial
Officer Andrew S. Fastow, acted as managing partners or investors in
these partnerships, despite the fact the partnerships were treated as
unconsolidated affiliates. Fastow--who liquidated more than $30
million of his own Enron shares--reportedly received an additional
$30 million in managing fees from the partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Enron's independent accounting firm may have
pushed the limits of conflict-of-interest rules. Andersen, previously
in charge of insuring the accuracy of the books for Waste Management
and Sunbeam, had received about $1 million a week in fees from Enron
for accounting and auditing. But the auditing never resulted in a
disclosure that the partnerships existed primarily to hide debt,
which meant that, on paper, Enron seemed profitable. Now Andersen has
admitted to destroying Enron documents and has fired its chief Enron
auditor, David B. Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   We are the plaintiff attorneys for Amalgamated Bank, which, as
trustee of an equity fund that invests the retirement savings of
union employees, suffered losses of $10.3 million in the Enron
collapse. (This amount represents just a fraction of an estimated $20
billion overall loss for public investors.)</TE>
<TE>   Under one of the few consumer protection provisions of the 1995
reform act, institutional investors, by serving as plaintiffs in
fraud litigation, can now help call corporations like Enron to
answer. An increasing number, including Amalgamated Bank, have
stepped up to try to recoup funds for unwitting investors.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron case is a symptom of the same disease that afflicted us
in the 1920s. The company is not a victim of market forces, but a
motivator as old as humankind: greed. It is past time for Congress to
revisit the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and enact true
reform. Otherwise, the financial well-being of millions of Americans
will remain in the hands of the insiders, who can be counted on only
to be faithful to the instincts of greed.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Once again, Pakistan is at the center of a South Asian storm.
Following a terrorist attack on India's Parliament building that New
Delhi blames on Islamabad, President Pervez Musharraf is working his
way toward a new diplomacy. He is trying to stave off Indian
retaliation, rearrange the remnants of his country's old Afghanistan
engagements, contemplate new Kashmiri strategies, find a way to
combat intolerance at home and weave a path toward renewed relations
with the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Embedded in his frantic activity is a brutal irony: Pakistan's
army is squeezing the country into the world's tightest corner, and
although everyone, including the West, is banking on Musharraf's
rule, Pakistan's survival depends on his capacity to relinquish power
and move toward democracy.</LD>
<LD>   Since its founding, Pakistan has been ruled too often by generals
whose insecurity and poor judgment have left the country living on
edge. The army's interests--alliances to support nuclear experiments,
close relations with China, meddling in Afghanistan and Kashmir and
cheer for U.S. interests that did not always coincide with its
own--have emboldened the military while exposing Pakistan to every
danger that domestic instability and an unstable region could conjure
up.</LD>
<TE>   The first casualty of military rule is accountability. When the
army patronized extremists to do its bidding in Kashmir and
Afghanistan, who could say "no" to misadventures that were
endangering the state? When the same extremists broke the law by
fomenting hatred and violence at home, the army couldn't say "no,"
either--at least, not without risking its foreign policies. When
civil libertarians criticized the links between domestic insurgency
and cross-border terror, no one was able to defend them from
harassment.</TE>
<TE>   Have things changed since the war against terrorism, the demise of
the Taliban, the Indian-Pakistani skirmishes and recurring fears of
war?</TE>
<TE>   Judging by Musharraf's recent speech, the answer is "maybe." His
plea for social progressivism, vague though it was, drew praise from
foreigners and sighs of relief from the millions of anxious
Pakistanis who have been held hostage to creeping intolerance,
violence and, in Musharraf's words, internal strife that is "eating
us up like termites."</TE>
<TE>   But a speech needs broadly-based policies, or it's only public
relations. Pakistan needs policies that rejuvenate its institutions,
and these, in turn, require an engaged public. These are not goods
that military governments usually value. Without them, however, the
fundamental contradictions within Pakistan's domestic and foreign
policies will easily betray Musharraf's determination to change
course.</TE>
<TE>   When foreign policy is predicated on fraud and terror, when the
army advocates policies that require illegal actions to implement,
when militant groups have enough resources to challenge the state's
monopoly on force, only a complete house-cleaning will do. Last week,
Pakistan's military government banned more extremist groups, although
not enough of them to make a significant difference, and arrested
more than 1,000 of their members. But Musharraf has yet to confront
his hardest, most important jobs: overhauling foreign policy to
protect Pakistan's people, borders and economy, and ensuring that the
fight against internal instability protects the rights of all
Pakistanis.</TE>
<TE>   This is why serious politics has to return to Pakistan, so that
government can help build a compassionate state where liberty is the
foundation for security. Not Musharraf's politics of constrained
public discourse, docile elected bodies and a paternalism mired in
old-fashioned feudalism. Rather, Pakistan needs political contests
that encourage open debate, enshrine the value of fundamental rights
and challenge--finally--the verities that army rule has persuaded
civil society to accept for too long.</TE>
<TE>   It would be better, of course, if a political makeover did not
emerge from fear of war. Pakistan's crackdown on religious extremism
looks like a response to Indian pushing and U.S. pulling, even though
it is Pakistanis who have been trying--and until now, failing--to
excise extremism from within. Had Musharraf seriously gone after
terrorism when he took office in a military coup in 1999, Pakistan
and its neighbors would probably be much safer, peaceful places.
Instead, even some of Pakistan's embattled liberals now fear that
Musharraf is as good as they will get from an army laced with
militancy.</TE>
<TE>   This is why army rule has to go--because Pakistanis should be able
to choose, not cower and compromise. If Musharraf truly believes his
words, then he will ultimately have to stand habit on its head and,
like enlightened authoritarians elsewhere, do himself out of his job.</TE>
<TE>   This is why Musharraf's patrons in London and Washington need to
measure their actions with care. For the moment, Musharraf may seem
like a pliable autocrat who sounds like a politician and thinks like
a general.</TE>
<TE>   But those who believe that terrorism can only be countered by
military strongmen should take another look at Pakistan, where
authoritarianism and army rule have consistently fostered instability
and insecurity. And then they should ask how long Pakistanis should
pay for short-term thinking and politically empty, military-dominated
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, political change has come to Pakistan in the wake of
war, assassination and tectonic shifts in international politics. If
the silver lining in today's South Asian conflicts is a belated
recognition that civilians should run armies and armies should not
run states, then we may all be a bit wiser and much, much safer.</TE>

<HD>Copyright Wars: The Kings Strike Back</HD>
<DH>The family is not censoring history, it's protecting its
rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES L. SWANSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Martin Luther King Jr. was not a wealthy man. But he left behind a
valuable legacy of intellectual property--books, speeches,
manuscripts, sermons, letters and unpublished papers. Copyright law
protects that property, and therein lies the origin of a bitter
dispute over the ownership of King's writings.</LD>
<LD>   On the eve of the national holiday celebrating King's birthday,
his legacy is under attack, not by racists, Ku Klux Klansmen and
segregationists, but by scholars, civil rights leaders and the media.
The target of their attack is not King's message but his family--his
widow, Coretta Scott King, and their children.</LD>
<LD>   Late last year, the New York Post indicted the family as King's
"ignoble heirs;" the New York Times accused them of "misplaced
values," calling their behavior "distressing" and "heartbreaking;"
the Houston Chronicle smeared them as "grasping, greedy, tacky ...
and, worst of all, unworthy" of their slain patriarch. The attacks
climaxed with a CBS "60 Minutes" broadcast in which William
Rutherford, a former executive director of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, feared that King "must be spinning in his
grave." Reporter Lesley Stahl joined the chorus, mourning that "the
family has even been accused of killing the dream."</LD>
<TE>   Killing the dream? What monstrous thing has the King family done
to provoke such vicious criticism? It turns out that they're under
siege because they've chosen to protect what is rightly theirs--the
property they inherited from King after he was assassinated in 1968.
Under the Copyright Act of 1976, a federal law authorized by Article
I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution, the rights to King's writings
belong to his heirs.</TE>
<TE>   Like most intellectual property owners, the Kings protect and
license their rights. In 1997, they licensed Time Warner Inc. to
release a large quantity of King's writings--many hitherto
unpublished--in books and electronic media. The Kings also allow
nonprofit and educational institutions to enjoy certain noncommercial
uses royalty-free, and they make King's works available for a fee to
the media and other for-profit entities. They've licensed his voice
and image for at least two television commercials.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1993, the King family sued USA Today for publishing,
without permission, the entire text of King's most famous work--the
"I Have a Dream" speech he delivered Aug. 28, 1963, at the Lincoln
Memorial. They sued CBS in 1996 when the network sold videotapes
containing nine minutes of that speech. And they raised questions
when a group with no connection to the family proposed using King's
name to raise tens of millions of dollars to erect a huge monument on
the Mall in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   These actions have provoked outrage. Brent Staples wrote in the
New York Times that the family is trying to "corner the market" on
King's words, placing "profits above the national good." The Houston
Chronicle insisted that King's life (and presumably his copyrights)
"belongs to all of us." Sweeping aside more than two centuries of
property law, the Chronicle argued that "the standard that ought to
apply here has little to do with what is legally permissible ... it
has to do with what is right."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are guilty, say the critics, of three things: by
enforcing their property rights, they limit the dissemination of
King's writings and thereby censor history; by earning profits, they
dishonor their patriarch, who never cared about intellectual-property
rights; and by licensing television commercials, they display poor
taste. Those charges, in order, are illogical, false and irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   First, the family has no interest in suppressing King's works,
much less in censoring history. On the contrary, as their multimedia
deals with Time Warner and others demonstrate, they want his works to
reach the widest possible market. Ideas, facts and information about
King are not the subject of the copyrights; they're available to all.
Thus, the Kings can't prohibit authors from writing books and
articles about him; professors from teaching courses about him;
editors from publishing photographs of him; or producers from making
films about him. What they can control are his actual words, which
they are doing, but not in any way that suggests they're censoring
history.</TE>
<TE>   Second, it is false to claim that King did not care about
copyright. Unlike Leo Tolstoy, whose scruples against private
property led him to throw his works into the public domain, King
copyrighted his books. When he was alive, he sued a record company
for releasing unauthorized recordings of the "I Have a Dream" speech.
That hardly suggests that he meant his family to be bereft of the
financial benefits that his works might afford them after his death.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the question of whether licensing television commercials
is tasteful is subjective and irrelevant. Even if it did evidence
poor taste, the property still belongs to the family.</TE>
<TE>   This dispute over King's works is not without its larger
implications. Were they to carry the day, the critics would threaten
the very foundation on which the law of intellectual property--indeed
all property--rests. They advocate a de facto appropriation of King's
writings in the name of the "public interest." That logic leads
inevitably to the socialization of copyright, with authors subject to
the tyranny of the majority. Such a regime would effectively destroy
any expectation of copyright protection in the work of a public
figure. Perversely, the more important a work, the less copyright
protection it would deserve.</TE>
<TE>   That the critics are waging their campaign in the name of the 1st
only compounds their error. In so doing, they trivialize the
amendment, transforming it into a burglar's tool wielded by the
media. Their theory amounts to opportunism in the name of the "public
interest," "newsworthiness" or the "right to know." All property
derives its value from the power to exclude others. The right to free
speech does not include the right to take the speech of others for
free. Reasonable people may disagree about the scope of copyright
protection. But no one can deny that, under current law, King's
property is protected.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring property rights, a cornerstone of the liberty King fought
to secure, is an inauspicious way to celebrate his birthday. His
dreams may belong to the world, but his intellectual property belongs
to his family.</TE>

<HD>The Other Guys' Gift to the GOP</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH S. BAER and ADAM D. SHEINGATE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Without a Republican casting a single vote, the GOP has won the first
battle of the 2004 election. The Democratic National Committee has
set up a plan allowing states to hold their primaries and caucuses in
February, immediately after the first-in-the-nation Iowa and New
Hampshire contests.</LD>
<LD>   The DNC is fighting the battles of presidential elections past.
With these new rules, Democrats may be laying the groundwork for
future defeat.</LD>
<LD>   The DNC's complaint was that by going dark for five weeks after
the 2000 New Hampshire primary, the Democrats ceded the spotlight to
the Republicans. In addition, in states such as South Carolina where
the Republican primary was held in February, voters were confused,
turnout was down and states and parties had to foot the bill for two
contests. Harmonizing the calendars, the DNC says, would correct this
problem. Yet these nominating calendars were created to serve the
interests of the two parties, and in 2000, that was to protect their
respective front-runners.</LD>
<TE>   For the GOP, this meant avoiding the mistakes of 1996, when Bob
Dole went broke winning primaries and was effectively silenced until
federal funds were available to him after the Republican convention.
So the GOP front-loaded the process, and its front-runner, George W.
Bush, didn't accept matching funds, enabling him to spend a record
amount of money.</TE>
<TE>   For the Democrats, protecting the front-runner meant clearing the
way for Al Gore by taking the bounce out of New Hampshire. Remember
that, in September 1999, polls showed that Bill Bradley led in the
Granite State. But Gore secured a narrow victory. Creating a
five-week gap without a primary left Bradley--and whatever momentum
he had--with nowhere to go.</TE>
<TE>   But the lessons of 2000 make no sense for 2004. Here's why:</TE>
<TE>   * In 2004, the Democrats will face an incumbent Republican
president who will have virtually unlimited money as well as the
bully pulpit to dominate the airwaves. Having the media follow
Democratic candidates as they travel from contest to contest may be
the only way to keep Bush from dominating the headlines.</TE>
<TE>   * No Democrat can do what Bush did in 2000 and refuse public
campaign funds without committing political suicide. So even if the
primary scrap ends early, the Democratic nominee would lack the money
to compete with Bush before the convention in August.</TE>
<TE>   * By accelerating the front-loading trend, Democrats create a
situation in which only those who can raise $30 million and build a
national network can compete. If there's only one or two of these
candidates, as in 2000, then a quick contest can lead to a quick
conclusion. But it looks like 2004 could have four or five
candidates--Gore, House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of
Missouri and Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, John F. Kerry
of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina--who can meet
this standard. It's not beyond the realm of fantasy that it could
take a brokered convention to sort things out.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the GOP, the Democratic Party allocates its delegates
proportionally: Candidates who poll at least 15% in a state receive
the same percentage of delegates. A group of candidates with
approximate national strength and specific regional appeal could win
enough delegates to keep anyone from getting the two-thirds of
pledged delegates needed for nomination. With the rest of the
delegate votes in the hands of unpledged "superdelegates," Democrats
could find themselves spending the summer horse-trading
ambassadorships, not battling Bush.</TE>

<HD>English Isn't a Second Language on TV</HD>
<DH>Growing Spanish media won't take over the market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've seen the TeleFutura--and it may not be as ominous as some
expect.</LD>
<LD>   TeleFutura is the seventh and newest Spanish-language TV network
in this country. It was launched Monday by Los Angeles-based
Univision Communications Inc., the $6.8-billion company that is--for
now--the 800-pound gorilla of Spanish-language broadcasting in the
U.S.</LD>
<LD>   I write "for now" because these days nothing is certain in the
mass-media business except change. And the launch of this latest
Spanish-language network suggests that some Univision executives see
change coming.</LD>
<TE>   Univision's growth has been a big story for a decade. Purchased
for a mere $550 million in 1992 by A. Jerrold Perenchio, Univision
now has 26 television stations, 32 affiliates, a cable network and an
Internet portal.</TE>
<TE>   Its scrappiest competitor, Florida-based Telemundo, is no slouch
either. It owns 10 TV stations in major cities such as Los Angeles,
has affiliates in most other markets and a cable network. It was
recently purchased by NBC for $1.98 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Two other Spanish-language networks, Visalia-based Azteca America
and Hispanic Television Network of Fort Worth, are not as large. But
their growth would seem preordained, given the Spanish-language
broadcasting boom.</TE>
<TE>   But without denigrating the success of Univision or Telemundo,
allow me to suggest that there may be less to this Spanish-language
media boom than meets the eye.</TE>
<TE>   The phenomenal growth of these TV networks, not to mention dozens
of new Spanish-language radio stations from Georgia to Washington
state, has been fed by a historic wave of immigration from Latin
America that began in the late 1960s and may have peaked in the '90s.
Even the biggest waves ebb. And the end of our economic boom,
combined with political and economic reforms in Mexico and peace in
Central America, seems to have turned the Latin American immigrant
tide. At least declining numbers of illegal-immigrant arrests would
indicate that it has slowed.</TE>
<TE>   This means the Latino audience Univision and its rivals gear their
programming to is going to change in subtle but important ways.
Households that were only Spanish-speaking will include more Latinos
born in the U.S., who speak English and Spanish. Like other young
Americans, they'll prefer rap videos on MTV or American football on
ESPN to the recycled telenovelas (soap operas) that are the staple of
Univision and Telemundo.</TE>
<TE>   In Univision's promotion of TeleFutura, one hears acknowledgments
that their market is changing. "There is this huge audience that is
not watching Univision, and a large percentage are Spanish speakers,"
said one top Univision executive recently.</TE>
<TE>   That reality should reassure the groups that have looked upon the
proliferation of Spanish-language media in this country with concern,
and even alarm.</TE>
<TE>   Fearful Anglos who see Univision and its competitors as the
harbingers of some cataclysmic cultural shift can take confidence in
the vigor of English as our common language and in the continued
attraction of U.S. culture.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to the warnings of some demagogues, Latino immigrants are
not unassimilable.</TE>
<TE>   But even as Latinos assimilate, Spanish-language media won't fade
away. Their business won't grow as fast, but foreign-language TV and
radio stations and newspapers will still be viable--especially in
international cities such as Los Angeles. But they will have to
compete harder for an audience that shifts easily between languages.</TE>
<TE>   That should offer some hope to the many Latino activists who
criticize Univision and its competitors for not doing more to promote
TV shows produced by, and for, U.S.-born Latinos. They may find
broadcast outlets willing--or perhaps forced--to move beyond
telenovelas, tacky variety shows and old movies to focus on the
bilingual, bicultural reality of a unique American audience.</TE>

<HD>Enron Needed a Level Playing Field</HD>
<DH>The hefty cash flow of monopoly utilities wasn't due to a
free market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON M. THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While it is no perversion of language to describe Enron's collapse as
a scandal, it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify any
political dimension to the scandal or any course of action elected
officials can take to ameliorate the situation.</LD>
<LD>   With a criminal investigation and numerous class-action civil
suits underway, congressional investigations will do little more than
earn headlines and provide a platform for political mudslinging and
irresponsible charges.</LD>
<LD>   Thus far, the most oft-repeated accusation is that something must
be amiss because Enron was one of President Bush's top campaign
contributors, and Enron officials met with Vice President Dick Cheney
and other White House staff to help formulate the administration's
energy policy.</LD>
<TE>   There is also speculation that Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay
asked for federal assistance to avert bankruptcy. Whether or not this
is the case, his company's subsequent implosion makes it clear what
the answer was.</TE>
<TE>   Yet campaign finance crusaders and administration opponents argue
that whether Enron was offered a bailout is immaterial because Enron
had access to the "corridors of power."</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every misdeed alleged to have been committed by the firm
could be attributed to this access--and probably will be in the
coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   As unseemly as they may appear, Enron's political contributions to
Bush, as well as its millions in soft money donations to both
political parties since 1992, are relatively modest considering the
industry in which the company operates.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety-three percent of Enron's business is--or was--energy
trading: connecting energy producers to utilities, and natural gas
suppliers to generators.</TE>
<TE>   While natural gas pipelines and extraction have been deregulated,
the rest of the industry, for the most part, has not. Thus Enron's
core business was dependent on competitive energy markets and the
deregulation of electricity generation.</TE>
<TE>   Some may characterize Enron's attempts to open energy markets from
government monopolies--which have gouged consumers for decades--as
"buying influence." And the free-market advocates may disagree with
some of the policy initiatives Enron pursued, such as federal
financing for overseas energy ventures and open access to electrical
transmission facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there is no question that Enron's fortunes were inexorably
linked to consumer choice and the end of pervasive electricity
monopolies.</TE>
<TE>   The electricity monopolies Enron challenged were among the most
profitable businesses in the nation, thanks to their cozy
relationship with politicians. A National Assn. of Regulatory Utility
Commissioners report in 1993 found that electricity utilities
outperformed the S&amp;P 400 more than 87% of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the cash flow of monopoly utilities was not the product of
free-market exchange but the result of negotiations between the
corporations and political bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Far beyond buying influence, the political maneuvering of Enron's
energy industry antecedents actually determined their revenue, costs
and profit.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that competitive markets would eliminate this free ride,
electric utilities fought--and continue to fight--deregulation tooth
and nail.</TE>
<TE>   In most states where deregulation has occurred, including
California, the incumbent utilities have succeeded in manipulating
the laws to guard against unfettered competition.</TE>
<TE>   It should surprise no one that a business trying to open these
regulatory fiefdoms to competition must fight for its interests in
the public policy arena and, in the process, help to finance some
campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, some accuse the Bush administration of acting
improperly because it did not extend a federally backed line of
credit to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Such action would not only have been scandalous but would have
been inimical to the free market, which demands that risk be borne
privately.</TE>
<TE>   It is perfectly fitting that Enron was denied precisely the type
of government franchise that it worked to eliminate.</TE>
<TE>   As long as the government artificially structures markets and
rewards political patronage with regulatory services, political
contributions and influence peddling will remain an essential feature
of American business.</TE>
<TE>   Limits or even an outright ban on campaign contributions will do
nothing more than cap the price businesses may pay for these
government services.</TE>
<TE>   Serious reformers would be better served to target the disease,
not its symptoms.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Schools Need Better Oversight</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Tough Love for L.A. Schools," editorial, Jan. 15: I am in
agreement with LAUSD Supt. Roy Romer's decision to remove some of the
administrators from the 10 school campuses. I once taught at Wilson
High School and am fully aware of the problems there. But we can't
lose sight of other problems plaguing our schools, such as gross,
tragicomic mismanagement at all levels. For example:</LD>
<LD>   This past fall semester, a crew of workers appeared on our campus
to earthquake-proof every room. All furniture, cabinets and desks
were locked down with plastic adhesive strips. This in a school where
every four months teachers rotate rooms and have to move furniture.
They even attached my rolling file cabinet to a rolling book cart in
my classroom.</LD>
<LD>   Last week we received an in-school memo saying the district was
considering taking back all unspent IMA money (the smallest budget on
campus and the one that purchases classroom supplies) due to a
mid-year budget shortfall. One Brentwood school campus had to cancel
an after-school tutoring program due to similar budget cuts.</LD>
<TE>   How much money was spent to earthquake-proof our 700-square-mile
district? I see students every day discarding the plastic strips in
the classrooms and in the hallways, leaving the rooms no longer
earthquake-proof.</TE>
<TE>   Do you think there might be a problem with oversight? There might
be a budget shortfall, but who exactly is overseeing expenditures
downtown?</TE>

<TE>   As the mother of five children who have been successful in the Los
Angeles Unified School District, I agree that it's a great idea to
clean the schools of poor administrators and teachers. But what about
the poor parents, those with absolutely no conception of the
importance of education, who refuse to support the teachers?</TE>
<TE>   How effective can any teacher be when the student is so often
absent? There are children who have not yet returned from winter
break! And what about the many parents who never attend a
back-to-school night, an open house or a parent conference and who
refuse to be involved with their child's performance or behavior? How
do we "clean them up"? With no solution, how can a teacher or
administrator possibly be successful?</TE>

<TE>   Re "LAUSD's Building Fantasy," Opinion, Jan. 13: Please let us
assure you that the Los Angeles Unified School District can and will
build new schools and expand existing campuses. Three primary centers
have been opened in the past 18 months, one campus expansion is
already complete and five other projects are currently under
construction. This year, at least 13 more projects will break ground.</TE>
<TE>   Promises and mistakes of the past have been and are being
corrected. In the case of the Community Magnet located near Fairfax
and Venice, the focus of the article, a plan that was budgeted at $6
million ballooned to over $12 million, and it was fiscally prudent to
halt the project long enough to bring it back into line.</TE>
<TE>   Under the design of a new architect, it is now included in the
current priority plan and will include the following improvements: a
new multipurpose/food service building and an administration building
and restroom building. Some of the existing bungalows will also be
renovated. Internet access will be added, along with other safety and
technology features. Today, a team of professionals is in place to
rebuild Community Magnet. Within a year, the design will be completed
and approved by the division of the state architect. By next June
construction will begin.</TE>
<TE>   We have turned over a new leaf in the LAUSD building program, and
in the year it has taken to bring the Community Magnet project back
within budget, over 63 other new school projects have started and
completed design within the anticipated project costs.</TE>

<DL>STANFORD</DL>
<LD>On Jan. 10, President Bush signed into law a foreign operations bill
that included approval of $446.5 million for U.S. family planning aid
through the U.S. Agency for International Development. While that
amount represented more than he'd originally requested, the combined
total remains less than half of what Americans annually spend on
microwave popcorn.</LD>
<LD>   Congress also kept in place a Reagan-era "gag rule" that withholds
U.S. grants from foreign nongovernmental organizations using any of
their budgets to perform abortions or even provide abortion
counseling. The rule's full impact has yet to be measured, but it's
already known to have cut significantly into the services provided by
such effective reproductive-health groups as the International
Planned Parenthood Federation and Marie Stopes International. Worse
yet, in response to antiabortion groups' complaints that the U.N.
tacitly condones forced abortions and sterilization by aiding family
programs in China, the White House now has held up the funds for the
U.N. population agency.</LD>
<LD>   At a time when we've shown how quickly a nation can unite against
the threat of terrorism, our lack of resolution in the face of
increasingly threatening population pressures seems all the more
strange.</LD>
<TE>   While some early projections, including a few published in "The
Population Bomb," overstated how dire our food situation would be
today, the concern they raised, all too briefly, was inarguably
valid. The rapid adoption by farmers in the 1970s of the "green
revolution," with its higher yields from better seeds and
fertilizers, forestalled widespread famines. But even so, today some
10 million people a year die of problems related to inadequate diet.
Meanwhile, other issues raised in "The Population Bomb," such as the
threat of novel epidemics and climate change, were, in retrospect,
understated.</TE>
<TE>   The world's relentless population growth, including our own
weighty share in it as Americans, is inexorably leading us to an
environmental breakdown. Yet, our attention to this problem now seems
to be waning just when urgent action is needed.</TE>
<TE>   As President Bush decides what to do about those funds for China,
and as he finalizes next year's budget requests for international
family-planning programs, we urge him to think past the next
real-time crisis and invest in long-term risk management. Although
birth rates have slowed in much of the world, the population
continues to rise. At more than 6.1 billion, we're already seeing the
first breakdowns in our life-support systems, including severe
pressures on our freshwater supplies and climate changes that signal
potentially catastrophic instability. The United Nations Population
Fund recently warned we risk climbing to a population of 10.9 billion
by 2050 if we fail to ensure women's rights to reproductive health.</TE>
<TE>   Judge for yourself if we're meeting that challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians continue to argue over abortion, and advocacy groups
raise alarms at each new population forecast. Yet, there's little
debate about how many world citizens--or, in particular,
Americans--is desirable and how we can get to that number. The
world's richest, most powerful, most can-do nation, which adds about
1.7 million people to the world's population each year, far more than
any other industrialized country, still has virtually no domestic
policy and only a weak foreign policy on population.</TE>
<TE>   Though so fundamental in determining our future, population is "a
marginal issue, at best, in American public dialogue," says Robert
Engelman, vice president for research at Population Action
International. "The press runs screaming from it, and we lose an
opportunity to engage our own public and the world as a whole on how
population change affects our lives." While we can quickly summon the
will to crack down on terrorists, we balk at discussing birth rates,
made timid because the subject is so often polluted by racial or
religious bigotry. This is so despite the appalling fact that at the
dawn of the 21st century, nearly half of U.S. pregnancies are
unintended, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute.</TE>
<TE>   In strict financial terms, the United States remains the largest
single donor for international family planning. Yet, when viewed in
proportion to our giant economy, our donation is stingier than those
of other industrialized countries and grossly inadequate to the need.
At the U.N.'s 1994 International Conference on Population and
Development in Cairo, the 20-year price tag for global family
planning was estimated at $17 billion annually by the year 2000.
Developed nations vowed to provide one-third of that amount, making
the needed U.S. share nearly $1.9 billion for fiscal year 2001.
Instead, the U.S. has reduced its support from $667 million annually
in 1996 to its current level of about $480 million--with the "gag
rule" in effect. That means that while we annually export tens of
millions of dollars worth of made-in-America condoms, IUDs and
birth-control pills, we share in the blame for the continuing lack of
access to birth control endured by some 350 million couples in
developing countries worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Even as we stint on foreign aid, our population growth at home and
over-consumption of the world's resources contributes
disproportionately to the escalating exhaustion of our life-support
systems, including a stable climate. Freshwater scarcity--already a
reality in parts of Africa and the Middle East, where population has
been growing by roughly 2.5% a year--is predicted in some parts of
the United States within our children's lifetimes.</TE>
<TE>   Population growth also increases the worldwide threat of disease
by pushing ever-larger groups of humans into closer contact with
animal reservoirs of previously unknown pathogens. This increases the
probability that more AIDS/HIV-like epidemics will occur.
Furthermore, our security and that of our children is also at risk
from climate change, a threat that grows in parallel with our growing
population and profligate consumption of fossil fuels. The danger
could come in increases in coastal flooding, intense storms and
epidemics, as predicted by most mainstream scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of access to family-planning tools makes the world a
particularly dangerous place for women. More than half a million
women die each year from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth,
with an estimated 70,000 of these deaths stemming from unsafe
abortions. When First Lady Laura Bush offered sympathy for the
"brutal oppression" of Afghan women, she didn't go on to note that
governments that intentionally deprive women of access to
birth-control measures also tend to keep them uneducated, unhealthy
and out of the professional world and civic leadership. But she
should have, not least because societies with more women in
leadership roles may well be less brutal, both at home and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The Earth's population continues to grow by more than 77 million
people each year. Nearly one in three human beings are less than 15
years old. The decisions these young people make as they enter their
childbearing years--and their ability to follow through with
them--will affect us and our children through the rest of this
century. They, and we, need leadership so that we all can start using
the planet's resources more intelligently. President Bush can start
leading by asking Congress for more than he did last year for
international family planning. In the meantime, we'll wonder: What
new, real-time crisis must we face before we'll hear Laura Bush
talking about population policy on CNN?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Replacing an existing light switch with a dimmer allows you to adjust
the illumination in a room, and it's about a 10-minute project, even
for a novice.</LD>
<LD>   Dimmer switches come in a three common designs: rotary knob, slide
bar and toggle.</LD>
<LD>   The rotary knob dimmer allows you to control the light by turning
a knob. The slide bar design works the same way but the light level
is controlled by sliding a horizontal bar. The toggle dimmer looks
like an ordinary wall switch light and is controlled by simply moving
the toggle up or down.</LD>
<TE>   Whatever type you select, make sure it can handle the wattage of
the circuit it will control.</TE>
<TE>   Prepare to remove the existing wall switch by turning off the
power to the room by flipping the breaker at your electric panel.
Remove the switch plate by taking out the screws and then do the same
for the existing switch. Pull the switch out of the box as far as the
wires will allow. You should see two wires connected to the back or
side of the switch.Carefully remove the wires from the existing
switch by unscrewing the side terminal screws or by pushing a small,
thin screwdriver into the wire release holes.</TE>
<TE>   If needed, straighten the ends of the wires and/or strip off
insulation so that about five-eighths of an inch of bare copper is
showing.</TE>
<TE>   The new dimmer switch also has two wires coming from it that will
connect to the two wires in the wall. You will use the plastic "wire
nuts" to connect the wires. Make sure the dimmer wires are also
stripped to show about five-eighths of an inch of bare copper. With
pliers, twist the ends of a dimmer wire and a wall wire together and
thread a plastic wire nut over the pair so that it seats tightly. Do
the same for the other pair of wires. Wrap electrical tape over the
connection between the wires and nut.</TE>
<TE>   Carefully install the dimmer switch into the wall box and secure
it in place with the two screws from the old switch. Reinstall the
plate and flip the breaker back on.</TE>

<LD>The nation's housing market is expected to soften slightly this year,
but still post strong sales activity as the economy rebounds from a
shallow recession, according to the National Assn. of Realtors'
latest economic and housing forecast.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. David Lereah, the association's chief economist, said the
forecast anticipates a "negligible" 0.5% decline in national
existing-home sales to 5.23 million units this year compared with
2001's results.</LD>
<LD>   But new-home sales are expected to decline 3.2% to 874,000 units
and housing starts are expected to decline 4% to 1.54 million from
2001 levels in 2002.</LD>
<TE>   The final figures for 2001's housing markets have yet to be
tabulated, but the association's evidence thus far indicates sales of
existing and new homes set records last year.</TE>

<AU>JAMES CAREY and MORRIS CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Testing a smoke detector is just one of several home-maintenance
tasks that should be performed on a regular basis.</LD>
<LD>   Regular maintenance provides optimum longevity, helps prevent
malfunctions and ensures maximum safety for you and your family. Here
are a few other tasks that should be performed regularly:</LD>
<LD>   * Check furnace filters.</LD>
<TE>   The purpose of the filter on a forced-air furnace is to keep dust,
soot and other contaminants from collecting on the interior workings
of your furnace. In addition, a high-quality filter will cut down on
airborne dust and particulate matter that is blown into your living
area. Once the filter has been sufficiently coated with this grime,
it causes the furnace blower to work harder, making it more costly to
operate and shortening its life span. A clean filter will help the
furnace run more efficiently and save on operating costs.</TE>
<TE>   Because filter size and location vary from furnace to furnace,
you'll need to check the owner's handbook for information. If an
owner's handbook doesn't exist, information usually can be found on
the furnace or on an inside panel of the furnace. Some furnaces have
more than one filter that will need replacement. Buying replacement
filters by the case will cut down on the unit price and will make
replacement convenient.</TE>
<TE>   * Check water filters and softeners.</TE>
<TE>   Water filters are a great means of improving water quality (smell
and taste). The secret to keeping water quality high is replacing
filters regularly. The frequency depends upon the type of system and
the condition of the water. Whole-house filters, point-of-use
dispensers and ice-maker water supplies can each be changed in a
matter of minutes. Besides providing better water quality, a clean
filter will improve flow.</TE>
<TE>   Although a water-softening system is reasonably maintenance-free,
every now and again the brine solution becomes clogged at the base of
the brine tank, preventing the solution from being siphoned into the
resin tank. You know that is the case when your brine tank is full of
salt and your water doesn't have that slick feel. Check your owner's
manual for information on how to flush the brine tank, or call a
service professional to do.</TE>
<TE>   * Clean the dryer duct and filter.</TE>
<TE>   Clean the lint screen thoroughly after every load. If it's filled
and clogged with lint, the air won't circulate and the clothes won't
dry. The dryer runs far longer, which wears it out faster and wastes
energy dollars. Use a duct cleaning brush to clean the dryer duct at
least twice annually.</TE>
<TE>   * Clean and freshen sink drains.</TE>
<TE>   Foul odors from a sink drain can make your home unpleasant. To
keep sink drains in your running freely--and absent of odor--try
these methods: Run hot water through the sink after each use, throw a
handful of baking soda into the drain and add hot water or pour a cup
of vinegar into the drain and let it sit for a half-hour. Then run
very hot water.</TE>
<TE>   * Test smoke detectors.</TE>
<TE>   All smoke detectors and alarms have a "test button." Once a month,
get up on a chair, or use a broom handle for extra reach, and push
it. If you don't hear anything, your battery is dead. If after you
change the battery the smoke detector still is not working,
immediately replace it with a new one. Test the smoke detector by
striking three kitchen matches, blowing them out and holding them
near the unit. While you're checking your battery and testing the
detector, brush or vacuum the alarm to keep dust out of the
mechanism.</TE>
<TE>   * Test carbon monoxide detectors.</TE>
<TE>   The care and maintenance of a carbon monoxide detector is much the
same as for smoke detectors with regard to cleaning and frequent
testing. However, a carbon monoxide detector can't be tested using an
outside source. Therefore, it is imperative that the test buttons
provided on the equipment be tested at least once each month.</TE>
<TE>   * Flush the water heater and check the pressure and temperature
relief valve.</TE>
<TE>   Mineral deposits and sediment at the base of a water heater tank
make the job of heating water infinitely more difficult and affect
your utility bill. Check your water heater for sediment and remove at
least once annually.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure and temperature relief valve opens to release
pressure buildup in the water heater when the temperature or the
pressure gets dangerously high, thus preventing a possible explosion.
To test the valve, simply raise and lower the test lever several
times so it lifts the brass stem it is fastened to. Hot water should
rush out of the end of the drainpipe. If no water flows through the
pipe or you get just a trickle, replace the valve.</TE>
<TE>   * Test ground fault circuit interrupter receptacles.</TE>
<TE>   The ground fault circuit interrupter was developed to prevent
electrical shocks. All receptacles have test buttons. You should test
each receptacle in your home at least once a month. If the test
doesn't trip the breaker, replace it immediately.</TE>

<HD>Upstairs Neighbor Disturbs Their Peace, Property Value</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN GLASSMAN and DONIE VANITZIAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Two years ago we purchased a fifth-floor condominium in a
multistory building in an upscale area of Los Angeles. Before we
purchased, we researched the area, talked to other owners, visited
the police department and viewed the complex during the day and at
night. We bought it because there is no grass, pool, sauna or
Jacuzzi, no amenities other than a doorman and valet parking. We
thought the building was safer and the fees would be more
controllable here than in a typical condo complex with grounds and
amenities to upkeep.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after we moved in, so did the new unit owner above us. Our
upstairs neighbor is a wealthy drug dealer who has been in and out of
jail and currently is on probation. He is an insomniac who never
leaves his condo, runs the air conditioner all day and night and has
a stream of traffic to his condo 24 hours a day. The association
allows wood floors, and his squeak, creak and crack around the clock.</LD>
<LD>   Since he moved in, so have the ants. The ants streaming into our
unit have been so thick that two walls actually appeared black. At
great expense we tried to rid our unit of the ants but have been
unsuccessful.</LD>
<TE>   We have complained so often to the police that they now consider
us a nuisance. The police said this is not considered a public view
issue but a dispute between neighbors that needs to be resolved by
the board or management company.</TE>
<TE>   We complain to the board and the management company but to no
avail. For two years, the management company has had us fill out form
after form yet done nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Now the management company wants us to solicit our neighbors for
signatures to support our claims. The board will do nothing about the
floor noise, air conditioner and ants. We hired an attorney who wrote
the drug dealer a threatening letter. The day after he received the
letter, our cat was found dead.</TE>
<TE>   Then his attorney threatened to sue us for harassment. The board
and management company are now retaliating against us and the
situation has grown unbearable. What can we do?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: As egregious as your circumstances are, the law allows the
board to issue rules and regulations designed to deter complaints
rather than solve problems.</TE>
<TE>   Pest problems affecting the entire complex are usually the
responsibility of the board, although only termites are specifically
mentioned in the Davis-Stirling Act. If the board ignores those
problems, they will also ignore the real issue of nuisance neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Two alternatives remain after your board declines to take action.
Visit the Department of Health Services Web site (www.lapublic
health.org) and locate the L.A. County Quick Reference Guide for
department phone numbers, including those that deal with bugs and
pests such as ants.</TE>
<TE>   Next, contact the police department with information you may have
with respect to possible criminal activity in the building. Many law
enforcement agencies have neighborhood law enforcement teams with
designated lead officers to whom you can take your report.</TE>
<TE>   Whether in public view or not, a crime is a crime and law
enforcement should be interested in taking your complaint. If the
officer answering your call doesn't take your complaint, keep asking
for superior officers until someone takes the report.</TE>
<TE>   Make sure you obtain a copy of that report for your files.
"Proving" any violation is not your responsibility and further
involvement by you could be dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Write to your board, management company and the neighbor
explaining that the circumstances are a constant nuisance that
interfere with your quiet enjoyment. Unit flooring may not come under
the purview of the board to repair and should the neighbor choose to
ignore your request, the remaining option may be to file a nuisance
lawsuit, a choice likely to cost more than the resulting solution.</TE>
<TE>   If your building is not a security building, suggest that the
board hire guards and require everyone who is not a resident to sign
in and show proper identification, a tactic that may deter your
neighbor's visitors. The common areas of your building are owned by
your homeowners association and rules regarding visitors make much
more sense than those designed to control the individual homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   Short of exhausting your remedies with the board, and having
already reported the problem to the police, your last resort is to
sue your upstanding upstairs neighbor for nuisance. Given the result
of your police report, we cringe at what your lawsuit might bring.</TE>

<HD>Beware of Appreciation-Sharing Reverse Mortgages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. HARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Consider this exceptional financing opportunity for your home: The
lender gives you $58,000 in cash over a 32-month period. When your
home is sold a few months later, you owe the lender more than
$765,000.</LD>
<LD>   Sound like a nightmare? It's not. It's an actual mortgage
transaction that a subsidiary of the prominent Wall Street firm of
Lehman Brothers insists is legal, fair and precisely what the
borrower requested.</LD>
<LD>   Lehman's subsidiary, Financial Freedom Senior Funding Corp., is
demanding that huge payout from the estate of Lacy S. Eckhardt, a
widow who signed up for a reverse mortgage in April 1998. Eckhardt
died in December 2000. When her children sold her home the following
spring, they were stunned to receive a "final loan payoff demand" of
$765,112.13 from Irvine-based Financial Freedom.</LD>
<TE>   How could that be? Welcome to the world of reverse mortgages,
where poorly advised seniors--and their heirs--can lose tens of
thousands almost overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Eckhardt's daughter, Catharine Earhardt, recalls that "we knew
that she had taken out a reverse mortgage, but we had no idea of the
details. When we read the [loan] documents [after her death], we were
horrified."</TE>
<TE>   Reverse mortgages are designed to produce income for seniors by
converting homeownership equity into usable cash. The amounts
borrowed, plus interest and fees, typically need not be repaid until
after the homeowner dies, sells the property or moves out.</TE>
<TE>   Unusually High</TE>
<TE>   Percentage for Lender</TE>
<TE>   Some reverse mortgages contain equity-sharing or
appreciation-sharing features designed to cut the lender into a
portion of the appreciated value of the home at the time of sale. In
Eckhardt's case, the appreciation-sharing percentage was unusually
high--50% to the lender. The loan terms also required Eckhardt to
purchase an annuity that would not pay her a cent until 2012.
Assuming she was still alive, the annuity would then begin paying
$1,816 per month, in place of payments from the lender.</TE>
<TE>   Eckhardt paid $40,453 upfront for the annuity, but it carried no
death benefit or cash surrender value. At the time she applied for
the loan, Eckhardt was 69 and in chronically poor health, according
to her family.</TE>
<TE>   In a complaint filed in Westchester County, N.Y., Eckhardt's
estate claims that she was misled into applying for a mortgage with
"unconscionably high" costs, without counseling or legal guidance.
The complaint also alleges that she received an "artificially low
appraisal," which when combined with the appreciation-sharing
feature, allowed the lender to be "guaranteed a profit of at least
$225,500 even if [Eckhardt] died the day after making the loan,"
according to the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The appraisal arranged by the lender on the property valued it at
$980,000. Two follow-up appraisals paid for by Eckhardt's estate put
the market value around $1,425,000 at the time of the loan. The
estate sold the home in May 2001 for $2.2 million--more than double
the reverse mortgage appraisal value. A local realty agent said that
the $980,000 value placed on the home was so low "there would have
been a buyers' stampede" if it had been listed for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Complaint Entered</TE>
<TE>   Into Arbitration</TE>
<TE>   The Eckhardt complaint was not filed in court, but entered instead
in a mandatory arbitration proceeding, now underway. The reverse
mortgage documents signed by Eckhardt required arbitration for
borrower disputes but allowed the lender to use the court system to
file for foreclosure.</TE>
<TE>   In defense of the $765,000 payout demand--now totaling more than
$800,000 with penalties--a lawyer for Financial Freedom said Eckhardt
applied for the loan of her own volition and received full disclosure
of the terms. James Mahoney, chief executive of Financial Freedom and
co-chairman of the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Assn., noted
that Eckhardt's loan was originally made by Transamerica Home First,
whose assets were acquired by Financial Freedom. A major class-action
suit against Transamerica Home First has been filed in California,
alleging predatory lending practices in connection with loans similar
to Eckhardt's. That case is scheduled for trial in September.</TE>
<TE>   The Lehman Brothers connection is significant. Lehman acquired
control of Financial Freedom two years ago. The Wall Street
investment bank pools high-return loans such as Eckhardt's into
multimillion-dollar bonds, and sells pieces to private investors.</TE>
<TE>   Financial Freedom says it no longer makes appreciation-sharing
reverse mortgages such as Eckhardt's. But substantial numbers of them
still exist nationwide, critics say. Given the high rates of home
appreciation over the last five years, payoffs even larger than
Eckhardt's are ticking time bombs in high-cost markets around the
country--often without the knowledge of the families involved.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae, the giant home loan investor, once funded
appreciation-sharing reverse mortgages, but stopped when confronted
with the prospect of embarrassingly high early payoffs harmful to
seniors and their heirs.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took two years for owner Jeff Beuth to turn this simple tract
house into a custom, Zen-like contemporary in a lush greenbelt with
lots of bamboo.</LD>
<LD>   "I acted as the designer and picked all of the finish products
ranging from windows, doors, faucets, handles, paint colors,
appliances, stucco type, flooring, tile, plate covers, fireplace
finishes and plants," Beuth said. "Additionally, I furnished and
decorated the house."</LD>
<LD>   Beuth, 35, rebuilt the house through his City Corp. Ventures,
which has bought, remodeled and resold more than 150 houses since
1995. His 37-year-old brother, Randy, is a Hollywood cameraman who
helped form, and works part-time, for the building company.</LD>
<TE>   For this project, the brothers hired Norm Simon of Corner
Construction in Los Angeles to be the architect and builder.</TE>
<TE>   About this house: The original house was built in 1951 and was
3,375 square feet. "I added approximately 1,400 square feet and, as
you can tell, did a thorough remodel, which took the old house down
to a few studs," Jeff Beuth said.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $3,895,000, not including furnishings</TE>
<TE>   Size: Five bedrooms and six bathrooms in 4,700 square feet, on a
27,400-square-foot lot overlooking the city</TE>
<TE>   Features: Skylights, blond maple hardwood floors; four indoor
fireplaces and one outdoors; a media room with sliding doors to an
infinity pool and spa; a master suite with a sitting area, spa tub,
two-sided fireplace, steam room and limestone shower; four
closed-circuit security cameras, computer-controlled lighting and
sound; city and ocean views from almost every room.</TE>
<TE>   The house's Zen-like quality is due to its minimal style and
Balinese influences. Feng shui was considered in its design, which
incorporates natural stones and earth tones.</TE>
<TE>   Where: Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   Contact: Jeff Beuth, City Corp. Ventures, (310) 291-7330</TE>

<TE>   To be considered as a candidate for Home of the Week, please send
color interior and exterior photos (copies only, please; we cannot
return the pictures) and a brief description of the house, including

<LD>Oscar-winning actor Cuba Gooding Jr., who stars in the new movie
"Snow Dogs," and his wife, Sara, are doing a major renovation on a
Pacific Palisades house they bought 18 months ago for close to its
$3.5-million asking price.</LD>
<LD>   The house was built in the '40s and is on nearly an acre with
canyon views.</LD>
<LD>   Architect David Applebaum, who has designed home alterations and
additions for stars such as Bob Hope and Diane Keaton, is overseeing
work on the 3,500-square-foot house, which has been expanded to 8,000
square feet.</LD>
<TE>   Phase 1 is 80% completed, and Phase 2, which is nearly ready to
get underway two years earlier than planned, will include a new
swimming pool, four-car garage, boxing gym, screening room and
roller-hockey court.</TE>
<TE>   Phase 1 focused on the main house. From the front door, the actor
and his wife wanted visitors to be able to see the kitchen. The
intent was to make the house informal, warm and welcoming. The house
has two staircases to maintain family privacy when the actor is in a
meeting in the formal living room, which will double as his office.
The ceiling there has been raised from 8 to 12 feet to make the room
more spacious.</TE>
<TE>   Off the kitchen is a garden room, wine closet and china pantry.
The kitchen blends into a great room. The interior designer is Sean
Miller.</TE>
<TE>   The English Country-style house, with French influences, has a
master suite with a balcony, a maid's quarters and four family
bedrooms. There is an upstairs sitting room with a fireplace and a
guest room that could be a game room. The master bedroom also has a
fireplace and two walk-in closets.</TE>
<TE>   The house, which has a slate roof and copper dormers, is
surrounded by a terraced colonnade which complements the park-like
setting created by landscape designer Jay Griffith.</TE>
<TE>   Gooding, 34, isn't expected to move into his Palisades home until
at least December, but is said to be delighted over a home he never
could have imagined as a child. After his parents divorced when he
was in fifth grade, he and his mother, brother and sister lived in a
motel in suburban Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Gooding won a best supporting actor Oscar for his role as pro
football star Rod Tidwell in the movie "Jerry Maguire" (1996). More
recently, he appeared in "Men of Honor" (2000) and "Pearl Harbor"
(2001).</TE>
<TE>   "Snow Dogs," released Friday, is about a father who reunites with
his son during Alaska's Iditarod dog-sled race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker star Kobe Bryant has purchased a Newport Beach home for
about $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Mediterranean-style house, which is behind private gates and
is also in a guard-gated community, has a pool, spa, unobstructed
city and ocean views, and a video surveillance and laser security
system.</TE>
<TE>   The basketball star, 23, and his wife, Vanessa, had been looking
for an Orange County home to buy since August, when he backed out of
escrow on a $13.5-million, 10-bedroom home on 9.5 acres with a
lagoon, waterfalls and a half-scale replica of a pirate ship in Coto
de Caza.</TE>
<TE>   The basketball player's wife went to school and has family in
Orange County. The couple also has a Pacific Palisades home, which he
bought in 1999 for $2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Cohen, estate director for Re/Max Olson Brokerage, Westlake
Village, represented the Lakers player in buying the Newport Beach
home. Jeff Ewing of Coldwell Banker, Coast Newport Properties,
represented the seller.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Actor Wayne Rogers and his wife, Amy, bought a Westside condo and
are selling their longtime Beverly Hills house.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers, probably best known for his role as Capt. "Trapper John"
McIntyre on the TV series "MASH" (1972-83), is selling his Beverly
Hills home for close to its $2.95-million asking price. Escrow is due
to close Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   He had owned the five-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot home that was
built in 1923 for 30 years, but has been living primarily in Florida
for the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   He bought the condo for slightly more than $900,000. The
two-bedroom, 2,600-square-foot unit built in 1981 has a den with a
wet bar and greenbelt views.</TE>
<TE>   The actor, who starred with Bo Derek in the June TV movie "Frozen
With Fear," is also a home builder and financier. He and his wife, a
former producer of "Good Morning America," also have homes in Utah,
New York and Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Moore of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills, had the listing
on the condo. Sidney Kibrick and Barbara Weisberg of Nourmand &amp;
Associates, Beverly Hills, had the listing on the Beverly Hills
house.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pia Zadora has sold her Malibu house for about $5 million and
listed her Beverly Hills-area home at just under $7.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The actress-singer, 46, filed for divorce from her second husband,
writer-director Jonathan Kaufer, 46, in November. She was previously
married to multimillionaire Meshulam Riklis. When they were married,
they bought Pickfair, the legendary Beverly Hills home of Mary
Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks; Riklis refurbished the house, razing
much of it because of termites.</TE>
<TE>   Zadora's Cape Cod-style Malibu home, with 40 feet of beach
frontage and a grassy yard, had been on the market at just under $5.5
million. The remodeled home, with wide-plank pine floors, includes a
four-bedroom main house plus a guest cottage. It was purchased by an
L.A. businessman.</TE>
<TE>   Zadora's Beverly Hills-area home, with six bedrooms in about
10,000 square feet, also has a sunken tennis court, a pool with a spa
and expansive lawns.</TE>
<TE>   The house, on just under two acres, was built in 1988 but was
redone five months ago to add environmental and hypoallergenic
features. It has "bottled water quality" pool water, natural paint on
the walls, an air-filtration system and pesticide-free landscaping
and gardens. Zadora added a meditation room, a staff room, a laundry

<LD>Regarding "No End In Sight" by Diane Garrett, Jan. 6: In my opinion,
the problem [stalled home construction projects] can be solved by the
authority that issues building permits.</LD>
<LD>   Such permits are issued, based on architectural plans submitted,
and it should thus be possible to determine reasonable construction
time.</LD>
<LD>   If plans are changed during construction, additional time, if
needed, can be added to the permit. Add a margin of safety, say 30
days, and a completion date can thus be determined and made part of
the permit.</LD>
<TE>   Guaranteed financing must be part of the building permit as well,
and once construction starts, the contractor is obligated to finish
the project within the time allowed, or face a fine.</TE>

<LD>"Damage From Neighbor's Tree Is Worth Filing Claim" by Robert J.
Bruss, Jan. 13, clearly shows why the public has no respect for the
law, the courts and lawyers. Bruss gives the advice to file a lawsuit
because there is "everything to gain and nothing to lose."</LD>
<LD>   A reader requested legal advice about a neighbor's tree. The
reader had previously requested that the neighbor trim the tree
because branches overhung his property. The neighbor complied. Later,
a branch fell off the tree in a storm damaging the reader's house.
The reader wants to know if he can recover his insurance deductible
from his neighbor in Small Claims Court.</LD>
<LD>   As a lawyer and research attorney for the Los Angeles Superior
Court, I believe ... filing a lawsuit without having any legal
evidence of fault is nothing more than filing a frivolous lawsuit. I
disagree that by doing so the reader has "nothing to lose." The
reader will lose a cooperative neighbor who had his tree trimmed when
asked.</LD>
<TE>   We all lose by having courts that are clogged with frivolous
lawsuits. The court's integrity is undermined when forced to deal
with such nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, lawyers who give advice to file a lawsuit because
"anything can happen in Small Claims Court" encourage the perception
that the legal system is nothing more than a crapshoot. Our courts
exist to resolve legitimate disputes.</TE>

<HD>A Towering Feat</HD>
<DH>A two-story Tuscan turret with a blue tile roof is the
latest addition to a former 'junko' Hollywood Hills home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY PRICE-ROBINSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An accomplished Hollywood music attorney, Martin Cohen can be found
most days pushing a wheelbarrow across his two lush acres in the
Hollywood Hills, using his jackhammer (the rented ones were costing
him "a fortune"), sawing tiles in a converted gardening shed or
choosing plants at the nursery.</LD>
<LD>   "I've paid my dues. I can do what I want with my time," said
Cohen, 70, who has cut his lawyering back to two days a week.</LD>
<LD>   For the last 38 years, Cohen has poured much of his free time and
energy into his home, which he has transformed from "a junko
Colonial" he bought for $40,000 to the striking Mediterranean villa
it is today. "Everything you see, I've done," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The latest major project, completed earlier this year by a general
contractor, was the addition of a two-story Tuscan tower with a blue
tile roof, arched windows and a tiled fountain.</TE>
<TE>   The tower "is our greatest accomplishment," said Cohen's wife,
Trish. "My husband did all the stonework and mosaics."</TE>
<TE>   Martin Cohen bought the property in 1964 with an $8,000 down
payment that he borrowed from a friend. Once part of a larger estate,
the sloping two acres were mostly covered with 40 avocado trees,
Scottish broom and what he called "rat-catching ivy."</TE>
<TE>   Among Martin's first projects was a swimming pool, right outside
his bedroom, which he said he uses "religiously" every day. Later, he
built an adjacent hot tub in a gazebo decorated with tiles and
antique glass.</TE>
<TE>   To create a back patio, he built a retaining wall to hold back the
sloping ground and terraced the remaining land with flower and
vegetable beds, fruit trees, pathways and poultry yards. He used to
raise goats, and he still raises chickens, geese and turkeys for the
legendary feasts he and Trish prepare for friends.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years he has installed a walk-in freezer, a wood-burning
pizza oven and a series of wine cellars into the retaining wall. All
told, the property holds 9,000 bottles of wine. "I thought it was
11,000," Trish said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm cutting down," Martin said. "I'm beginning to believe I can't
drink it all."</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the house has evolved from a three-bedroom family home,
where Martin raised his two children, to a two-bedroom, five-bathroom
entertainers' delight. Martin dug out a basement wine cellar years
ago and festooned the walls with hand-cut tiles shaped like grape
vines. These days, all the parties end up down there. Said Trish:
"It's packed."</TE>
<TE>   Trish came on the scene 15 years ago and encouraged Martin to move
the decorating scheme away from the dark Mexican style he had
created, influenced by frequent trips to Tijuana, and toward a
lighter Mediterranean flavor.</TE>
<TE>   When she arrived, Trish said, "the house wasn't as pretty as it is
now."</TE>
<TE>   The quality and scope of the home's remodeling projects increased
dramatically in 1998 when the couple met general contractor Norman
Knoff. The first project was removing 37 tons of hillside to build a
garage for Martin's pristine 1952 Rolls Royce.</TE>
<TE>   Right away, Knoff noticed the home's ragtag kitchen, barely more
than a kitchenette, where Trish had cooked for as many as 150 guests.
She was used to making do, having grown up one of nine children in a
two-bedroom cottage in Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the biggest mishmash I've ever seen," Knoff said of the
kitchen. But it did contain a giant Wolf stove, which Trish said
attracted her when she first met Martin.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Trish and Knoff persuaded Martin to convert the home's
attached garage into a full-sized kitchen--but it wasn't easy.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit the roof," Knoff said. He recalled Martin saying: "She's
not going to make me move my tools, is she?"</TE>
<TE>   Looking into the packed garage, Knoff retorted: "How long has it
been since you've used your fishing poles? Twenty-five years?"</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Martin relented. "Martin's very old-fashioned," Trish
said. "It's hard to move him."</TE>
<TE>   She credits having the contractor as an ally for making the
kitchen and an attached pantry into a reality. "Norman saved my
life," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As the kitchen neared completion, Martin added his touch by
covering a large arch with stone, and installing tiles from Ann Sacks
onto the edge of the stove hood. He also retained the $28 wrought
iron pan rack he bought years ago in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   The $73,000 tower came about when Trish requested "a real clothes
closet" in the master bedroom. Martin was happy with the narrow,
low-ceilinged corridor he created in an attic space. But it was too
claustrophobic for Trish, who told Martin his next wife should be no
taller than 5-foot-2. But, Martin said, Trish is "a keeper."</TE>
<TE>   At first, the couple wanted to build a second story over the
bedroom, but as Knoff explained the process, they realized it would
be too disruptive for them and their menagerie of cats and dogs.
Plus, Thousand Oaks designer Doris Anne Mendenhall pointed out, a
second-story closet and the existing first-floor bathroom would make
for a clumsy arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the tower, to be attached adjacent to the bedroom at
the end of the house, was conceived of and sketched out by
Mendenhall. It called for a blue tile roof to match that on the
existing house, a faux door that evokes a castle and an ornate
fountain.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the ground floor of the tower would serve as Trish's
cedar-lined closet and the second floor, accessed by a spiral
staircase and open to the bedroom, would be an exercise room.</TE>
<TE>   Constructing the tower with its massive exposed ceiling beams and
rafter was a dramatic event. An early idea was to drop the entire
roof unit from a helicopter, but ultimately the 600-pound beams were
hauled in through the windows.</TE>
<TE>   "Five guys," Martin said. "All brute force."</TE>
<TE>   The roof tiles alone required three weeks to cut and install. With
construction done, Trish called in Closet Factory to equip the
circular space with a sophisticated blend of mirrors, shelves,
cabinets, shoe racks, glass-fronted drawers and rods for hanging
garments.</TE>
<TE>   "See what I paid $80,000 for?" Martin asked a visitor. Said Trish:
"I think that's cheap. Don't you?"</TE>
<TE>   Now that the tower is done, Trish worried briefly that
Martin--whom she refers to as Paddy O'Cohen when he passes with his
wheelbarrow--will have nothing to do.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry," Knoff said. "There's a list."</TE>

<AU>ROBERT GRISWOLD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Must the owner place security deposits into a separate
account? Must this account be interest-bearing for the benefit of the
tenants?</LD>
<LD>   Property manager Robert Griswold replies:</LD>
<LD>   The owner is not required to place the deposit into a separate
account but must be able to properly return the security deposit
(after making lawfully allowed deductions) within 21 days as required
by California law.</LD>
<TE>   There are currently no requirements for owners to pay interest on
security deposits unless you live in select rent-controlled areas.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Ted Smith replies:</TE>
<TE>   There is no requirement that your rental owner place the security
deposit into either a special or an interest-bearing account. Tenant
groups have unsuccessfully lobbied California lawmakers to force
landlords to pay interest on security deposits. There is no bill
pending before the legislature at this time. On your departure, all
the landlord has to do is return your deposit after any lawful
deductions.</TE>
<TE>   California real estate brokers need to be a little careful
regarding security deposits. The California Department of Real Estate
requires licensed brokers to maintain trust accounts for client
moneys. . This includes licensed property management firms, which
hold tenants' security deposits.</TE>
<TE>   Tenant's rights attorney Steven R. Kellman replies:</TE>
<TE>   Landlords need not place security deposits in separate
interest-bearing trust accounts, although there should be a law
requiring it. Since there is no such law here in California, many
landlords simply use the deposits for their own purposes. In other
words, they spend them. When it is time to refund a deposit, they are
faced with having to return money that they have already spent. Some
then play the deposit deduction game. This game is played by the
landlord who "finds" deductions such as cleaning, damages and rent
owed to justify keeping the deposit.</TE>
<TE>   For example, there may be a large cleaning charge when the tenant
spent the whole day cleaning the place. Costs may be charged for
items that just wore out from age, or maybe deductions were taken for
repairing something that was broken from the beginning of the
tenancy. Sound familiar?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, many landlords sincerely try to follow the deposit law.
If the deposits were kept in a trust account, however, more landlords
would be less likely to play the game since the money would be right
there and not already spent when it is time to make that refund.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, a security deposit may be used to pay rent left owing
after moving out, damages beyond normal use or cleaning. Tenants
should protect their deposits by following some simple steps. Be sure
to document damages upon moving in, and let the landlord know about
anything that needs repair from normal use during the tenancy. Upon
moving out, have the place professionally cleaned (including the
carpets) and get a receipt showing the work was done. It may cost a
little, but it will save a lot in deposit deductions.</TE>
<TE>   Fading Romance Not Grounds to Break Lease</TE>
<TE>   Q: Late last year, I moved into a home and signed a long-term
lease with my boyfriend. The relationship is not working out. If we
were able to advertise and find new tenants, could we break our lease
and receive the security deposit back?</TE>
<TE>   Griswold replies:</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, but relationship problems do not qualify as grounds for
legally breaking a lease. Contact your landlord and see if he will
cut you any slack. In today's rapidly escalating rental market, the
landlord may even be able to rent your place for more money and will
let you cancel the remainder of your lease.</TE>
<TE>   Check your lease carefully to see if you are allowed to sublease,
but 99% of all California leases prohibit subleasing without owner
approval (which is not likely to be granted). Otherwise, you and your
boyfriend are responsible for the entire amount of the rent each and
every month until the owner re-leases the property.</TE>
<TE>   The landlord must handle the security deposit in compliance with
California Civil Code section 1950.5 and provide an accounting and
any balance after deductions within 21 days.</TE>
<TE>   Smith replies:</TE>
<TE>   Your landlord has every right to expect full performance of the
lease from both of you. Your personal problems with your
boyfriend/roommate are not the landlord's.</TE>
<TE>   If you give your landlord authorization, he will try to rent the
apartment to qualified replacement tenants. You and your boyfriend
will remain responsible until the house is re-leased. You also may be
held responsible for advertising and marketing expenses. Unless the
landlord is able to get someone else in there right away, it's
unlikely that you will receive your security deposit back.</TE>

Break</HD>

<SE>Realty Tax Tips</SE>
<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although a loss on the sale of your principal residence is never tax
deductible, most sellers who plan ahead can avoid owing tax on their
profitable home sale.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1997, Internal Revenue Code 121 has simplified most
principal residence sales. In fact, it's no longer necessary to even
report most exempt home sales less than $250,000 to the IRS.</LD>
<LD>   To qualify, the seller or sellers must have owned and occupied
their principal residence an "aggregate" two years during the last
five years before its sale. The two years need not be continuous
occupancy.</LD>
<TE>   If a house or condominium is owned by a qualified resident, up to
$250,000 of principal residence sale capital gains are tax-free. When
a husband and wife, filing jointly, both qualify, then up to $500,000
of home-sale profits are tax-free. Title need only be in one spouse's
name if both meet the two-year occupancy test.</TE>
<TE>   Once the aggregate two-year ownership and occupancy test is met,
the residence need not be occupied by the owner or owners. For
example, if you lived in your house for two years and then rented it
to tenants for the last three years (or less) before selling it, you
qualify for up to $250,000 of tax-free home sale profits (up to
$500,000 for a qualified married couple filing jointly).</TE>
<TE>   This tax break can be used as frequently as every 24 months. For
example, you might buy a fixer-upper house, move in, renovate it
while living in the home and make a profitable sale after as little
as 24 months of ownership and occupancy. If you do this over and over
every 24 months, you'll soon become known as a "serial home seller."
How else can you earn up to $250,000 of tax-free profits every two
years?</TE>
<TE>   Most couples in the process of getting a divorce soon learn
Internal Revenue Code 1041 allows tax-free inter-spousal realty title
transfers during the marriage or as part of a divorce.</TE>
<TE>   However, the old pre-1997 tax law was unfair, granting one
ex-spouse possession of the family home until the youngest child
turned 18 or 21, at which time the home was to be sold. Under the old
tax law, the ex-spouse living in the house got all the tax breaks
when selling, and the ex-spouse not living in the home got none.</TE>
<TE>   But the 1997 Tax Act allows both spouses to claim up to $250,000
of tax-free profits, even if one spouse is not living in the
residence. In other words, if an ex-spouse (called the "in spouse")
lives in the family home for at least two of the five years before
its sale, then the nonresident "out spouse" can also qualify for up
to $250,000 of home sale tax-free profits.</TE>
<TE>   Internal Revenue Code 121 has a special rule for a surviving
spouse. He or she can claim up to $500,000 of principal residence
sale tax-free profits if the home is sold in the year of the other
spouse's death. But if the home is sold in the next tax year after
the spouse's death, then only up to $250,000 of home sale profits are
tax-free.</TE>
<TE>   This rule might seem harsh, forcing widows and widowers to quickly
sell their homes or lose an extra $250,000 of tax-free profits.
However, the surviving spouse's adjusted cost basis on the half of
the home received from the deceased spouse is usually "stepped up" to
market value. In community property states, the surviving spouse's
new basis is usually stepped up to market value on the entire home's
value, so this is not an issue in those states.</TE>
<TE>   When two or more unmarried co-owners each meet the ownership and
occupancy tests, each co-owner can claim up to $250,000 of tax-free
sale profits when the home is sold.</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate, suppose two friends own and occupy their principal
residence at least two out of the five years before its sale. The tax
result is up to $500,000 total tax-free sale profits, up to $250,000
for each co-owner. If three friends own and occupy a principal
residence two out of the five years before its sale, the result is up
to $750,000 of tax-free sale profits.</TE>
<TE>   If you own a second or vacation home, in the right circumstances,
its sale might be tax-free if you meet the two-year ownership and
occupancy test.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Barbara and George spend November through April each
year in their Houston home. They spend the other six months, from May
through October, at their home in Kennebunkport, Maine.</TE>
<TE>   If they should decide to sell either residence and can prove it
was their principal home an "aggregate" two out of the last five
years before sale, then it can qualify for up to $250,000 of tax-free
profits per qualified seller.</TE>
<TE>   If your home sale profits exceed the $250,000 or $500,000 limits,
it is possible to shelter more than these amounts from capital gain
taxation.</TE>
<TE>   This is accomplished by converting the property into rental
status. Then, regardless of the sale profit amount, the property can
become eligible for an IRC 1031(a)(3) tax-deferred Starker delayed
exchange for another investment or business property of equal or
greater cost and equity. There is no minimum rental time before the
converted previous personal residence becomes eligible for a
tax-deferred exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Home sellers who are knowledgeable about home sale tax avoidance
are often surprised how simple IRC 121 really is. Careful tax
planning can easily result in principal residence tax-free sales
profits up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for a married couple filing
jointly). Consult with a tax advisor to maximize tax savings from a
home sale.</TE>

<HD>Time to Replace Inefficient Dryer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>From Associated Press</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Does your clothes dryer leave things damp, or overly dried and
super-wrinkled? It's a common problem with older dryers. Not only are
clothes wrinkled, tangled or damp, they also use far more energy than
new ones do--whether gas or electric.</LD>
<LD>   One feature on newer models is auto-reversing drum rotation that
changes back and forth every few minutes to minimize tangling and
wrinkling. This also speeds up drying and saves energy. New moisture
sensors work better, saving energy, preventing over-drying, wrinkling
and eliminating the need for ironing.</LD>
<LD>   Got an energy-guzzling time-wasting dryer that's frustrating and
wasting money? Check out what's new at the appliance store.</LD>

<HD>Wonders Down Under</HD>
<DH>AUSTRALIA: Above the reef and in the rain forest of
Queensland, gem-hued sea life, turquoise waters and jewel-toned
butterflies beckon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY V. HAINES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CAIRNS, Australia</DL>
<LD>Wish you were here. The weather's fine. Tomorrow it will be partly
fine, but it's expected to become fine and humid.</LD>
<LD>   "Fine," I deduce from the Australian weather reports, is the
equivalent of what we Americans call "fair." I thought I knew how to
speak Australian; I've seen the Crocodile Dundee movies and eaten at
Outback Steakhouse. But when I greeted our hotel desk clerk with
"G'dye, mite," he merely paused, swallowed and said, "Sorry, not even
close."</LD>
<LD>   Still, I was better than fine, because I was doing essentially two
vacations in one--reef and rain forest--and I was doing it in a place
that, although tropical and exotic, is reminiscent of a Robert Young
and Donna Reed America.</LD>
<TE>   My wife, Janice, and I were here in August as part of a two-week,
three-city package that also took us to Sydney and Brisbane. I don't
think I would have selected four days in Cairns had we not purchased
a package that included it. But we soon were glad we had come.</TE>
<TE>   To imagine where Cairns is, think of a map of the United States
flipped over so that Maine is in the south. The upside-down "Florida"
is the Cape York Peninsula of Queensland, and Cairns is about where
you would put Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   "Cairns" isn't pronounced the way it looks, of course, this being
Australia. The way Queenslanders say it, you don't hear the "r." But
it is English. You don't need Berlitz lessons to visit Australia. And
that's the appeal of the country: comfortable and strange at the same
time.</TE>
<TE>   Many guidebooks relegate Cairns, a town of 100,000, to that
awkward category of "not very interesting, but a good jumping-off
point for places that are." Nevertheless, it is one of the major
tourist destinations in Australia, attracting 1.5 million visitors
annually.</TE>
<TE>   You may not have heard much about it because you have heard
instead of what it's close to: the Great Barrier Reef.</TE>
<TE>   Cairns can't claim all of the reef. It extends 1,250 miles from
the Tropic of Capricorn to New Guinea, and it has an area about equal
to Arizona's. It's not just a big, long undersea wall either; it's
actually more than 2,000 reefs and islands, all formed from the
skeletons of coral polyps.</TE>
<TE>   But the reef snuggles in close to the coast--as close as 20
miles--near Cairns, whose international airport distributes divers,
snorkelers and honeymooners to small resort communities that in turn
put them aboard boats with a magnum of sunscreen and ship them out to
the reef. A good many of the visitors are Aussies, who in August come
north where it's warmer. (The seasons are opposite from those in the
U.S.; when it's summer in the U.S., it's winter Down Under.)</TE>
<TE>   We boarded a catamaran near Port Douglas, 30 miles north of
Cairns. The hourlong bus trip to the port had been a bit of a trial
for me: The Australians apparently share the British love for highway
roundabouts, and I concluded that they deliberately tried to make us
carsick so seasickness would seem a blessing. In its defense, the
road was curved beguilingly along the water, permitting "ooh"-worthy
views of the Coral Sea and the beaches south of Port Douglas.</TE>
<TE>   I was surprised at the size of the catamaran. I was expecting
something with room for six people and a beer cooler. Instead, the
fleet of five catamarans operated by Quicksilver Connections could be
the navy of a small nation. The vessels, about 115 feet long, can
haul 300 to 400 passengers, and, powered by water-jet engines, they
thrust through the water at speeds of up to 40 knots (about 46 mph).</TE>
<TE>   It took 90 minutes to reach the Great Barrier Reef, but the trip
was smooth. The catamarans are called "Wave Piercers," designed to go
through the waves rather than over them. So the boat trip was less
bumpy than the bus trip, and although seasickness medication was
available, neither Janice nor I needed it, and I don't think anyone
else did either.</TE>
<TE>   Our base for the next few hours was the Agincourt Reef Platform.
On approach, it resembled a giant card table set up in the middle of
the ocean. How were we all going to fit on that?</TE>
<TE>   It's bigger than it appears, though--about 160 by 75 feet and 230
tons--and can accommodate all the passengers who arrive by Wave
Piercer.</TE>
<TE>   The relatively tame water in which the platform rests is a pale,
transparent green, but not far away it turns Ty-D-Bol blue. There was
a line of real waves out there, foaming white where they collide with
the coral barrier. On the other side the bottom reportedly drops down
more than a mile.</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to know how to swim to appreciate the reef;
instead, you have only to descend the stairs into the "basement." The
lower level of the platform has underwater windows that allowed us to
see the coral formations, the inquisitive fish looking at the
inquisitive people and the kicking legs of dozens of snorkelers.</TE>
<TE>   We then boarded a 30-passenger semi-submersible boat, half in the
water, half out. We sat in a long, narrow row, Roman galley style,
with thick windows on either side. The skipper skillfully guided us
through little notches in the reef, never damaging the precious live
coral and, more important from my perspective, never breaking one of
those windows.</TE>
<TE>   During our half-hour trip, we glided over staghorn coral and brain
coral, looking just like their names suggest. We also saw fish in
Busby Berkeley formations. Their intense colors confirmed for me that
there must be a creator and that he must spend his weekends painting.</TE>
<TE>   Back on the platform, Janice prepared to do what she does
well--swim--and I to do what I do well--go to the buffet. The
platform is essentially a large picnic shelter and has no kitchen, so
the catamaran had transported supplies, using its winch to lower huge
containers of cold food to the assembled throng.</TE>
<TE>   As I dined, surveying my companions, it occurred to me that
besides the many nicknames Australia already has (Down Under, Oz,
Sunburnt Country), everyone had missed an obvious motto: Australia,
Land of Dorky Hats. Big, wide-brimmed contraptions that tie on, Paul
Hogan specials with crocodile teeth in the band, a leather bush hat
called the "oiled squashy." Australia is a land preoccupied with not
frying the noggin. For good reason too: The ozone layer has thinned,
and Australians have among the highest skin cancer rates in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Janice, wearing a wetsuit and two coats of SPF 45, was mask-down
in the water, paddling above the coral, prying into the home life of
fish. Another of the group members, who declined the offer of a
wetsuit because she wanted to "get some color," certainly got some,
and the color was scarlet.</TE>
<TE>   Janice had taken an optional tour, led by a marine biologist, that
went by boat to a quieter section of ocean away from the splashing of
neophytes, where they could view sea cucumbers, multiple
configurations of coral and clownfish, which change sex depending on
the reproductive needs of their community.</TE>
<TE>   Back on the platform Janice invited me to join her group as they
watched the underwater video that a crewman made of their trip. There
was my mermaid wife, holding a sea cucumber and never once uttering,
"Ewww, gross!"</TE>
<TE>   The Quicksilver cat took us back to Port Douglas, where we chose
boat rather than bus to return us to Cairns. We found a spot on the
afterdeck that sheltered us from the breeze as the coast slipped by.
I could see why the area is popular with honeymooners, and even old
married couples clung together, watching the sun set over the
silhouettes of the trees.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Cairns we searched for dinner. Cairns may be mainly a
jumping-off point, but it's a good place for dinner once you've
jumped back. Its small downtown is home to cuisines as diverse as
Italian and Thai. If there is little uniquely Australian cuisine to
be found here, the Red Ochre Grill satisfies the curiosity of the
gastronomically adventurous with crocodile fritters, emu pate and
kangaroo steak. "Bush tucker," our guidebook called it. The chef also
uses native-grown seasonings to enliven otherwise more traditional
dishes--eucalyptus salmon, for example. It was one of the best meals
we had in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Cairns' rectangular layout of low-rise, workaday buildings and its
informal pace are reminiscent of an American Midwestern town. Until
tourists discovered Far North Queensland, it was a somnolent seacoast
village that depended on the mining and sugar cane industries nearby.
Nevertheless, today Cairns definitely is aware of its role in
tourism: The arcades and waterside avenues are filled with souvenir
stands.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in our trip, when I told a fellow tourist we would be
visiting Cairns, he just muttered something like "T-shirt capital of
Australia." But I wasn't disappointed that Cairns wasn't Monaco,
although it does have a casino.</TE>
<TE>   My only disappointment was the absence of animals. Apparently
misled by the books of my childhood, I expected to see koalas in
every tree, kangaroos loitering at street corners. Perhaps that is
true somewhere on the continent, but here on the east coast, while
the famous beasts are present, they are reclusive, and you may have
to go to a zoo or special park to see them.</TE>
<TE>   Thus a trip to Kuranda, 22 miles northwest of Cairns, is more for
scenery than for wildlife. Kuranda is the terminus for a railroad
built in the late 19th century to get supplies from Cairns to the
miners and loggers of the Atherton Tableland through territory that
was nearly impenetrable. Those were 22 difficult miles, climbing
through jungle and along deep gorges, and construction took five
years and required 15 tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   We appreciated that task when we went to Kuranda by train, a
creaky old railroad with wood coaches. For the first few miles of the
trip the train rumbled authentically along through the suburban
backyards of the flood plain, but then the Kuranda Range appeared,
and we began to creep a thousand feet upward through the trees.</TE>
<TE>   As the coastline receded, we focused on the rocks and gorges and
rain forest greenery, none of which would lend itself to easy
railroad construction. At Stoney Creek, high in the mountains, we
curved around a bend so big that we could see nearly the whole train
and yell "G'dye!" through the open windows to our mates at the other
end. Much of the curve was on a bridge, held up by spindly legs in
front of a rock wall against which a small waterfall splashed.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, hippies adopted Kuranda. We still could see some
traces of that era--the back-to-nature feel of the craft shops, the
sense of community in the flea markets--but, mostly, Kuranda's
hippies had become Kuranda's entrepreneurs. Wood crafters, leather
toolers, potters--Kuranda is a knickknack and bric-a-brac mother
lode. While some of the T-shirt and souvenir ashtray stuff we could
find just as easily in the U.S., Australian aboriginal art tempted
me. But then, what exactly does one do at home with a 5-foot wood
didgeridoo? Start an Australian band?</TE>
<TE>   Instead of buying, we ate. We found the Veg Out Cafe, an excellent
vegetarian restaurant (count on a hippie village to get veggie
cooking right), and for about $10 we dined on falafel and
Malaysian-style noodles, accompanied by fruit shakes. We felt
virtuous: We would observe the animals, thank you, rather than eat
them.</TE>
<TE>   Not that we would eat butterflies anyway. We had a choice of three
venues for spying on animals--an aviary, the Noctarium (a mini-zoo
featuring bats, spiny anteaters and other Australian nocturnal
animals) and the Australian Butterfly Sanctuary--and we chose
butterflies.</TE>
<TE>   Soon we were in a warm, gymnasium-size room filled with greenery
and flying swatches of color. A spunky young guide explained the
rigors of butterfly life: all those metamorphoses from egg to
caterpillar to chrysalis to adult. And for what? For 24 hours of sex,
a few weeks of bragging about it, then death. But at least they get
to look good.</TE>
<TE>   The Cairns birdwing butterfly looks cut from green silk. The
Ulysses butterfly is black when viewed from below, but electric blue
from above. One butterfly landed on Janice's head and refused to
leave; others alighted fearlessly on her hand. Butterflies seemed to
love her. None of them was interested in me.</TE>
<TE>   Kuranda lies in the heart of the rain forest and is a biologist's
fantasy because of the continent's unique geological history.
Australia has species of plants and animals you can't see
elsewhere--giant fig trees, koalas, platypuses--adapting to their
respective environments. Somewhere back in time, Australia broke away
from the other continents and followed its own evolutionary agenda,
boogieing to its own biological beat. One of the best ways to view
the forest--particularly if, like us, you have limited time--is from
above. A Skyrail Cableway gondola car took us high above ground, and
we skimmed along, eye to eye with the treetops. We saw giant palms,
vines, ferns and mistletoe. At 150 feet, the red penda trees are so
tall they should have red beacons.</TE>
<TE>   The 4.7-mile ride is a three-hop journey, and we stopped at
transfer stations for long-shot views of gorgeous gorges, close-ups
of the rain forest vegetation and extreme close-ups of the bugs
(little ant railroads running up the tree trunks) that live in it.</TE>
<TE>   A bus gathered us up at the bottom of the mountain and took us
back to Cairns. Rather than dining out on our last night, we shopped
Woolworth's (in Cairns it's a supermarket) for fresh bread, salami,
cheese and Shiraz wine for a picnic in our room at the Cairns
Colonial Club. The picnic was delicious, simple but satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   Like Australia. Back in the States, I longed for the innocent
comfort and the scenery we had found here, and in my yearning, I
savored the memory of the reef, the rain forest and those fine, fine
days Down Under.</TE>

<LD>The "volunteer vacation" is a widely misunderstood travel concept.
The programs involve domestic or international travel for the purpose
of performing socially beneficial labor. You assist various groups in
building low-cost housing, teaching English, digging wells,
maintaining hiking trails or performing other useful tasks.</LD>
<LD>   Even though you work hard at these services, usually you don't
receive free room and board in return, especially if the program is
three weeks or less. The planning, preparation and administration of
such programs cost money, for which the sponsoring organization
requires a fee from the volunteer.</LD>
<LD>   And though such charges are usually much smaller than those of a
commercial tour, they can be substantial, and they rarely include
transportation to the site, which the volunteer must cover.</LD>
<TE>   Still, some volunteer programs charge only nominal sums, and a
handful pick up basic room and board. (Keep track of whatever
expenses you incur because some may be tax deductible.)</TE>
<TE>   Here are five affordable and soul-satisfying examples of a
volunteer vacation to consider.</TE>
<TE>   * Willing Workers on Organic Farms ("WWOOF"), care of New England
Small Farm Institute, P.O. Box 608, Belchertown, MA 01007; (413)
323-4531, www.wwoof.org. This group assigns its volunteers from all
over the world (all ages, though most are young and earthy types) to
learn farming techniques while helping a network of mostly family-run
organic farms in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Europe and Korea.</TE>
<TE>   You join a small team on each farm, pitch in with daily chores and
acquire firsthand organic farming techniques, like pesticide-free
planting and compost fertilizing. You can usually count on some
sheepherding, sowing, harvesting, milking of cows and making cheese
and yogurt.</TE>
<TE>   Time commitment: usually a few days but as much as a few months,
depending on your host farm. Cost: a $30 membership fee, then your
half-day's work pays for a full day's room and meals. Air fare and
other costs are the participant's responsibility. Requirements: a
willing heart and a strong back; no age limit.</TE>
<TE>   * Wilderness Volunteers, P.O. Box 22292, Flagstaff, AZ 86002;
(888) 737-2888, www.wildernessvolunteers.org. This group works with
public land agencies to promote outdoor volunteering in America's
wild lands.</TE>
<TE>   Each trip lasts a week; has 12 or fewer participants, who sleep in
tents or in a dorm; and includes such tasks as restoring streams,
planting trees, repairing trails or taking inventory of species on
national park, Forest Service and other public lands. Guides do the
cooking with the help of participants, and there's ample time to
explore the wilderness you are helping preserve.</TE>
<TE>   Groups vary in age, but the organization tends to attract active
people from 20 to 40. Locations include California, Hawaii, Utah,
Wyoming, Washington, Oregon and Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   Time commitment: one week. Cost: $198 per week (not including
transportation to and from a park and your own camping gear).
Requirements: age 16 and older, and physically fit.</TE>
<TE>   * El Porvenir, 2508 42nd St., Sacramento, CA 95817; (916)
736-3663, www.elporvenir.org. It builds village water projects in
now-peaceful Nicaragua.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers in six- to 10-person "brigades" join with local
residents and bilingual guides to construct wells, latrines and
community washing facilities. There's time to visit and converse with
Nicaraguan organizations and groups. Lodgings are in private homes,
village schools or modest hotels, and the stay includes a
recreational weekend at a beach. Participants' ages vary.</TE>
<TE>   Time commitment: two weeks. Cost: $325 per week, including food,
lodging and land transportation (but not air fare). Requirement:
physical fitness. No Spanish language skills or construction
experience needed.</TE>
<TE>   * La Sabranenque, Rue de la Tour l'Oume, 30290 Saint Victor la
Coste, France; (716) 836-8698 in the United States,
www.sabranenque.com. It works to preserve and restore the ancient
architecture of the Provence region of France and far northern
regions of Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Work includes construction and restoration of medieval stone
buildings, castles and ramparts. From March through October,
volunteers labor at sites with experienced technicians, acquiring
traditional Mediterranean techniques of stonecutting, roof tiling,
flooring, masonry and arch and vault construction.</TE>
<TE>   Costs cover double occupancy in restored stone houses, and
family-style meals with your co-volunteers. (Groups are limited to
35.) Volunteers are of all ages.</TE>
<TE>   Time commitment: two to three weeks. Cost: $225 per week, not
including air fare. The three-week Italy and France program is $430
per week. Requirements: ages 18 and up, and physical fitness. No
construction skills or knowledge of French or Italian are necessary.</TE>
<TE>   * Sierra Club Service Outings, 85 2nd St., 2nd Floor, San
Francisco, CA 94105; (415) 977-5522, www.sierraclub.org/outings.
Outings are short stints at clearing trails in Nevada, maintaining
beaches in Puerto Rico, preserving historical sites in Utah, tracking
dolphin patterns on Midway Island, removing invasive plants in
California or numerous other useful tasks in the outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   Groups of 10 to 18, including a leader and cook, stay in
accommodations ranging from tents to lodges. Most participants are in
their mid-40s to early 50s, though groups often include retirees.
Some trips can be strenuous, but most are accessible to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Time commitment: Most trips last one week; some are 10 days. Cost:
$295 to $495 per week. Requirements: ages 18 and older. There are
also special trips for 15-to-19-year-olds.</TE>

<HD>A New Star on Hawaii's Horizon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A newcomer is sailing the waters around Hawaii. Until late last year,
American Hawaii's Independence and United States Lines' Patriot, both
operated by American Classic Voyages, were the players. But American
Classic Voyages filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in October and
ceased service. Norwegian Cruise Line's new Norwegian Star entered
the picture.</LD>
<LD>   The only catch: Norwegian Cruise Line is a foreign-flag ship, so
it is required by federal law to call at a foreign port in the middle
of a cruise that begins and ends in Hawaii. The ship's itinerary each
week allows a passenger to board in Honolulu on Sunday, call in Kona
on Monday, spend Tuesday at sea, sightsee Wednesday in the Republic
of Kiribati, spend Thursday at sea on the way back to Hawaii, call in
Lahaina on Maui on Friday, spend Saturday in Nawiliwili, Kauai, and
return to Honolulu on Sunday morning. Passengers may also board in
Maui on Friday and disembark there the next Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Star called in Los Angeles in early December on its way to its
year-round home port of Honolulu, and we joined about 1,000 travel
agents and media representatives for a three-day cruise off the
California coast.</LD>
<TE>   The 2,200-passenger, 91,000-ton Star has 10 restaurants, and in
the casual spirit of the Hawaiian Islands, a passenger need never don
a tie, let alone a tuxedo.</TE>
<TE>   About 18 months ago, Norwegian Cruise Line introduced "freestyle
cruising," aimed at a younger traveler who doesn't like structured,
traditional cruising.</TE>
<TE>   NCL has abolished the idea of assigned dinnertimes and tables or,
as senior vice president of sales and marketing Andy Stuart says,
"spending the whole week in one restaurant with one waiter." Instead,
passengers may eat when and where they please, but sometimes paying a
surcharge for the privilege and usually needing a reservation for the
popular times and venues. They also are automatically billed $10 a
day per person for gratuities (except for children younger than 4)
but may make adjustments to this amount by telling the reception
desk.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional dress codes are gone. There are no designated formal
or semiformal nights. Instead passengers wear what they please,
within limits. "We enforce our rules of no jeans, no T-shirts and no
baseball caps at dinner," Stuart says. "Before, we had a dress code
but didn't enforce it. [The new system] has actually smartened up the
dress in the evening."</TE>
<TE>   Another popular feature of freestyle cruising, Stuart says, is
that passengers need not vacate their cabins early on departure
morning but may occupy them until they want to disembark. (The only
requirement is that passengers leave the ship while customs and
immigration officials are still on duty.)</TE>
<TE>   The Norwegian Star should delight cruisers in Hawaii who were
accustomed to smaller, older vessels. All cabins include two lower
beds that can convert to queen size, a divided bath with large
shower, TV, mini-refrigerator, safe, hair dryer and coffee maker.</TE>
<TE>   The less expensive accommodations measure as much as 170 square
feet, the standard industry size for new ships, adequate but not
spacious. Inside (windowless) cabins start at a brochure price of
$1,629 per person, double occupancy, for a seven-day cruise; an
outside cabin with window but no balcony starts at $1,789 per person,
double. Early booking discounts may lower those fares considerably;
ask your travel agent.</TE>
<TE>   Mini-suites and suites range from 229 to 5,802 square feet. The
latter two are jaw-dropping suites, each with its own living room and
dining room; three separate bedrooms, each with a luxury bath whose
glass walls face the ocean; and private rooftop terrace and garden
with gazebo, outdoor dining table, whirlpool spa and sunbathing area.
Each villa is priced at $28,000 for the seven-day cruise. It can
accommodate six adults and even a child or two on sofas or foldaway
beds, so this could be the ultimate luxury getaway for a small group
of family or friends.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 restaurants include two large dining rooms, the opulent
Versailles and the cool and elegant Aqua, each with its own menu; the
Market Cafe buffet and the Blue Lagoon food court, both open 24
hours; La Trattoria, a casual red-checkered-tablecloth Italian
evening eatery tucked into the corner of the Market Cafe; and Las
Ramblas Tapas Bar &amp; Restaurant, serving Spanish-style appetizers.
These restaurants are free to passengers, and only La Trattoria
requires a reservation.</TE>
<TE>   Four other eateries serve dinner with surcharges that start at $10
per person. They include Endless Summer, a big, airy restaurant
serving Hawaiian food; Ginza, an Asian restaurant with a sushi bar;
and Le Bistro, with traditional French dishes and tableside service.
The SoHo Room offers high-end contemporary cuisine a la carte or a
fixed meal for $14 without wine, $25 with a glass of wine served with
each of three courses.</TE>
<TE>   There are ice cream bars, hamburger grills, indoor and outdoor
bars and lounges, including an English pub with giant sports TV and
karaoke rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Families will find an enormous children's center, an indoor play
area with separate "Snooze" and "Flicks" rooms and a sheltered
outdoor deck with several water-slide pools and spas just for kids.</TE>
<TE>   The Barong Spa Center, operated by Hawaii-based Mandara Spa,
provides Eastern- and Western-style beauty and health treatments and
in-suite massages, and a large indoor lap pool at sea.</TE>
<TE>   Exercisers will find a 24-hour fitness center with treadmills and
other machines, and e-mail users can keep in touch 24 hours a day at
one of 17 terminals in the Internet Cafe (75 cents a minute).</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment on board is good, with three lavishly staged
shows on each cruise. On our sailing they presented "Asia Cirque,"
featuring Chinese acrobats, and "Music of the Night," a salute to
Andrew Lloyd Webber.</TE>
<TE>   A small wedding chapel can be booked for ceremonies in port;
contact the NCL wedding planner at (800) 392-3472.</TE>
<TE>   The only downside to freestyle cruising seems to be that not much
is free. But for a company targeting a new cruise audience accustomed
to resort and hotel travel and facing steep competition in today's
slow economy and declining travel market, perhaps this is what it
takes to stay in business.</TE>
<TE>   To get a free color brochure, contact a travel agent, call (800)
327-7030 or log on to www.ncl.com.</TE>

locomotives of yesteryear chug on.</DH>

<DL>CIENFUEGOS, Cuba</DL>
<LD>Surrounded by fields of sugar cane, under a sunset sky streaked with
orange, the rails stretched off into the distance. Along the
narrow-gauge track rattled a train of cars loaded with cane. At its
head, two antique steam locomotives, built in 1909 and 1920 in
Philadelphia, struggled to keep the train moving. At its hind end,
aboard primitive cabooses and flatcars with seats, 68 Americans held
on tight when the cars shuddered as they banged through a switch
leading to an acopio, or reload, where the cane was chopped and
transferred from truck to train. There another locomotive panted
softly, nudging cars into place to be filled with short lengths of
cane.</LD>
<LD>   Despite sitting on hard seats--or having to stand--and the general
lack of amenities, most of these American passengers were happy to be
riding the rails of Mal Tiempo, a sugar mill (or central, as they're
called in Cuba) in the country's midsection.</LD>
<TE>   So close, so inaccessible, so enigmatic, Cuba has intrigued a
generation of Americans forbidden to travel here. The island's
mystique and its attractions are manifold. Beaches and resorts.
Mojitos, the rum, lime and mint concoctions much favored by Ernest
Hemingway that have become the year's hot cocktail stateside. An
accidental museum of American automobiles from the '40s and '50s,
most still running well. The earthy, infectious music brought to our
attention by the movie "Buena Vista Social Club."</TE>
<TE>   Add to this predictable list a less likely attraction: steam
locomotives. For Americans who love trains and, in particular, find
steam locomotives charismatic, Cuba has tantalized for decades as a
paradise just out of reach. The nation is like a museum of working
American trains. The faithful have known that for the annual zafra,
or sugar harvest, every February, a ragtag armada of locomotives
comes to life to haul Cuba's chief product and export from fields to
mills--and, to a lesser extent, to carry refined sugar and molasses
to customers, usually through an interchange with the Cuban National
Railways (the Ferrocarriles de Cuba, or FCC). About 100 steam
locomotives are at work during the harvest--although the number drops
each year, despite the resourcefulness of mill mechanics.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian, British and European steam locomotive enthusiasts for
years have been coming to Cuba, and recently more and more U.S.
citizens have been traveling here illegally--but with increasing
impunity. Because of an embargo enforced by the Treasury Department
under the Trading With the Enemy Act, it's not going to Cuba that is
against the law; it's spending money here.</TE>
<TE>   So when Trains Unlimited Tours announced a two-week trip for last
March, one that would be legal and licensed by the Treasury
Department as an educational outreach tour, I was one of 68 train
buffs who signed on.</TE>
<TE>   Our group visited 13 mills, including one worked by ancient
electric locomotives. Only one was a bust, showing us nothing more
than diesels and a cool welcome.</TE>
<TE>   At the rest, we saw 27 steam locomotives, all made in America, of
two gauges--standard (which run on 4-foot, 81/2-inch-wide tracks) and
narrow (with tracks only 2 feet, 6 inches wide). For economy, several
of the lines into the fields were built in narrow gauge; lines from
the mills interchanging with the national railroads had to be
standard.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest steam locomotive we saw dated from 1903 and the newest
from 1925. The highlights were four mills where we could climb aboard
a train and ride: the Rafael Freyre, Mal Tiempo, Cuba Libre and
Venezuela. (When the mills were nationalized after Fidel Castro's
revolution in 1959, they were renamed, most often for political or
revolutionary heroes or neighboring countries.)</TE>
<TE>   We also spent a few days riding the main lines of the Cuban
National Railway (mainly in chartered American-built diesel rail
cars) and one highly memorable ride on the antique electrified
interurban cars (sort of streetcars on steroids) of the former
Hershey Cuban Railway, now also part of the national system.</TE>
<TE>   We participants in the "Cuban Rail Historian Tour" who arrived at
Havana after a short charter flight from Miami (operated by
Gulfstream International Airlines, a Continental affiliate) were a
diverse group. Most were serious rail fans, though others just liked
trains and were taking advantage of an opportunity to visit Cuba. Of
the dozen women, many (though not all) were spouses of those in
category one. Although steam locomotives were the primary focus,
there was time to enjoy more mainstream attractions: the beaches,
mojitos, classic cars, music and, in my case, some Hemingway shrines.</TE>
<TE>   From the airport, the buses that were our primary mode of
transport whisked us to the Hotel Plaza in Old Havana. The Plaza is a
classic example of the puzzle of contemporary Cuba. Still a grand
hostelry, it opened in 1909, closed in 1985 and reopened in 1991
after a renovation. With a spacious, high-ceilinged lobby and, on the
bedroom floors, broad halls that open onto a central courtyard, the
place evoked the writings of Hemingway.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a decade after renovation, however, the spartan guest
rooms were edging into disrepair. After an initial stay at the Plaza
we returned three times; on each occasion, something was amiss in my
room--a dangling shower head, an absent lightbulb. An unadvertised
feature of the trip was the chance to get a good look at pure
communism just beginning to be diluted. Shoddiness and sloppiness
appeared to be items clearly on the debit side. On the plus side, on
my tour I saw little of the brutal poverty, ill health and
malnutrition common in developing nations.</TE>
<TE>   Getting right down to business on our first afternoon, we visited
two mills, both just a short ride from Havana. Amistad con los
Pueblos, it turned out, wasn't milling that year, but two locomotives
were maintained there to work nearby mills. Crews ran them back and
forth over about 50 yards of track while our cameras clicked and
camcorders whirred. My heart sank. Was this uninspiring little skit
going to be the pattern for the next two weeks?</TE>
<TE>   The second mill, Gregorio Arlee Manalich, quelled my worry. This
neatly manicured mill property buzzed with activity. A standard-gauge
locomotive (built in 1918 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works) switched
covered hopper cars--full of molasses, probably because that's what
most mills produce--to interchange with the FCC. As this trimly
painted steamer slipped its wheels, the fireman--called a
fogonero--jumped down from the cab and trickled sand from a can onto
the rails for traction. The oil fire flashed in the firebox (all
Cuban steam locomotives burn oil), throwing the maquinista--the
engineer--into hellish profile.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, three fetching narrow-gauge Baldwins (of about the same
era as their big brother) darted back and forth, shunting cars of
cane. From the balcony of the operations center where I stood and
watched, it all looked like a wonderfully hyperactive model railroad.
Like kids in a candy shop, we hardly knew where to point our cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Cuba is one big island, more than 780 miles long, and our
itinerary had us crisscrossing it by bus more than I would have
liked. Bus travel was not without interest, however; the two-lane
highways were used by nearly every mode of transport: buses, trucks
(many with beds packed sardine-like with standing travelers), autos
of many vintages (with '40s and '50s models predominating), bicycles,
tractors, horse cars, oxcarts, cane wagons.</TE>
<TE>   From Havana we headed east (with an overnight stay in Moron and
three mill visits) to the coastal resort town of Guardalauaca. Three
nights there allowed the less steam-obsessed among us to swim in the
Hotel Guardalauaca's expansive pool or the ocean and relax, while
most of us trekked to nearby Rafael Freyre for two days of riding on
its narrow-gauge railroad.</TE>
<TE>   The chartered rides were leisurely jogs that offered a welcome
window on rural Cuba. With the sweet notes of the steam whistle
heralding our coming, we passed boys throwing a much-repaired
baseball and clusters of townspeople waving from each modest
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   We stopped (by prearrangement) at a small traditional tobacco farm
with a thatch-roofed drying shed. The host handed out cigars.</TE>
<TE>   Steam fan though I am, I was enchanted by the former Hershey Cuban
Railway, an electric line built--along with mill and company town--in
the teens by Milton Hershey, primarily as a source of sugar for his
Pennsylvania-based chocolate company. We covered the 57-mile main
line between the village of Casablanca (across the harbor from
Havana) and Matanzas, another port city east of Havana. Our transport
was a pair of heavyweight interurban cars built around 1920 by the
J.G. Brill Co. Again, this was classic American transportation from
75 years ago: a single-track line, wood trolley poles and kerosene
marker lights on the big, rumbling cars that wandered across an
agricultural landscape. It could have been Iowa in the '30s.</TE>
<TE>   Some in our group would have preferred more general sightseeing,
but our travels across the island--to rural areas and small cities,
as well as Havana--provided countless glimpses of Cuban life. In the
colonial city of Cienfuegos, called the "Pearl of the South," we had
time to stroll through Marti Park and admire the splendid
buildings--cathedral, library, art gallery--that line it. But our
frequent returns to Havana offered the best chances for tourism off
the rails, and I was especially eager to see Hemingway's old haunts.
I visited a perfect little hole-in-the-wall bar and restaurant, La
Bodeguita del Medio, where a trio played guitars and a clutch of
young women danced sinuously. Posted on the wall was a Hemingway
quote, "My mojito in La Bodeguita, my daiquiri in El Floridito," a
nearby watering hole. I visited both, drank both, then dropped in at
Room 511 (now a museum) at the Ambos Mundos Hotel, where Hemingway
lived and worked at times in the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, a group of us hired a gypsy taxi--a Chevy from the
1940s--to visit the "Museo Hemingway," his villa on Havana's
outskirts. This lovely, veranda-encircled building is virtually
untouched from the day he left, with furniture and endless shelves of
books intact. But the museum is entirely uninterpreted (in any
language), and it can be viewed only through windows.</TE>
<TE>   Our last whiff of steam came near Moron, on the rails of the
Venezuela mill, where we highballed out into the cane fields aboard
four bright orange cabooses behind an immaculately maintained
locomotive, its smoke box star-studded, its boiler wiped to a high
sheen. We returned hauling loads of cane, arriving back at the mill
at dusk. There our buses waited to whisk us back to the Hotel Moron.</TE>
<TE>   But roughly a dozen of us held out, choosing to return aboard the
national railways charter train that had brought us to the mill--a
string of Romanian boxcars converted to marginal coaches by the
addition of windows and folding bus doors. A few bare bulbs dangling
from the ceiling provided just enough light to find and pop open a
last warm beer.</TE>
<TE>   Exhilarating and clamorous, the ride back was not to be
missed--cars slamming and banging, diesel horn wailing insistently. I
sat on the steps with the doors pushed aside as we surged through the
fragrant darkness of cane fields. The air was luxurious, the cool of
evening just right after a hot day.</TE>
<TE>   This particular American was still very, very happy.</TE>

<HD>Smile, Buckle Up and Behave; Hidden Cameras Fly Too</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"This is your pilot. We have reached our cruising altitude of 35,000
feet. And by the way, will the passenger in Seat 32B please keep his
seat belt fastened?"</LD>
<LD>   By now we should be accustomed to being on camera in stores, at
work and nearly everywhere else. And soon you'll be on camera while
flying with JetBlue Airways, the New York-based low-fare airline that
serves 18 cities, including Long Beach and Ontario, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   Amid ongoing security concerns in the airline industry, JetBlue is
installing hidden cameras in passenger cabins that can be monitored
by pilots. It plans to have the system running on at least one plane
by Feb. 1 and on the rest of the airline's fleet of 22 Airbus A320s
in the next few months, said Mark Dash, JetBlue program manager at
Florida-based LiveTV , which is installing the system. He believes
JetBlue will be the first U.S. airline to install security cameras in
commercial passenger cabins. Delta Air Lines confirmed last week that
it is testing a similar system.</LD>
<TE>   "You're being watched for your own safety," said JetBlue
spokeswoman Fionna Morrisson. But she acknowledged that "if you're
acting against the law," the airline could take action. Dash said
that besides alerting pilots to security problems, the cameras can
also monitor smoking, air-rage incidents and other cabin activity.
"There would be a video record of them [passengers] doing what
they're not supposed to be doing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The airline's planes already carry antennas that feed up to 24
channels of live satellite TV to passengers' seats. The security
cameras will "piggyback" on that system but instead feed video images
of the cabin to two monitors on the flight deck, one for the pilot
and one for the first officer, Dash said. Pilots will also get a
weather channel but not, despite their joking requests, ESPN, he
said, because "we really don't want the flight crew watching
television."</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue, which began operating two years ago, is on an expansion
binge. It plans to buy 12 more planes this year and to expand from
three round trips each day between New York's JFK, its main hub, and
Long Beach, its new West Coast hub, to 27 per day by August 2003,
Morrisson said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the Sept. 11 attacks, New York City has been quietly expanding
its tourist attractions and facilities. Major shopping emporiums
aimed at children have opened in the last two months, and this month
Ritz-Carlton plans to open a hotel about four blocks from the former
World Trade Center site.</LD>
<LD>   A huge new Toys R Us Times Square store is part of the area's
efforts to reinvent itself as a family destination. The
110,000-square-foot building at 1514 Broadway, between 44th and 45th
streets, has a 60-foot-tall Ferris wheel with neon lights, a
two-story Barbie dollhouse and a 34-foot-long Tyrannosaurus rex that
moves. Do we need to mention that you can also buy toys there? Open
10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Mondays to Saturdays and 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sundays.
(800) 869-7787, inc.toysrus.com.</LD>
<LD>   At 10 Rockefeller Plaza on 48th Street, Pokemon USA Inc. has
opened its first U.S. store. Besides selling video games and other
paraphernalia based on the Japanese cartoon characters, the store
lets visitors try out Pokemon games on 42-inch screens and view
hourly sound-and-light shows for free. It is open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Mondays to Saturdays and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sundays. (212) 307-0900,
www.pokemoncenter.com.</LD>
<TE>   On Jan. 29 the $210-million Ritz-Carlton New York, Battery Park,
will open near the southern tip of Manhattan at 2 West St. near
Battery Place. The 39-story glass-and-brick tower, New York's only
Ritz-Carlton (until another opens this spring on Central Park) will
offer views of the Statue of Liberty and New York Harbor and, to the
north, the former World Trade Center site. Besides a 298-room hotel,
the tower will have 113 private condominiums.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel has luxury touches such as a "bath butler" to draw baths
and telescopes in some of the rooms. Reflecting its location near the
financial district, room rates are higher on weekdays, starting at
$325 per night versus $199 weekends. (800) 704-5643,

<HD>Princess Cruises Revamps Activities for Children</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Princess Cruises has expanded its programs for children, adding
science and wildlife activities, spa services for teenagers and more
age groups. The program is free except for spa services, priced from
$10.</LD>
<LD>   The line began testing the program on six of its ships and plans
to expand it to the rest of the fleet by May 1, said spokeswoman
Denise Seomin. Staff from the California Science Center in Los
Angeles will offer stargazing, reef-habitat studies and other
hands-on activities, depending on the destination. The National
Wildlife Federation is providing materials on conservation.</LD>
<LD>   The Teen Spa program has the usual facials and manicures but also
offers face paint, henna tattoos and body and hair glitter. Also new
is a schedule of free activities in port; formerly, kid-sitting
charges were levied during port stays.</LD>
<TE>   In another change, Princess is allowing younger infants aboard. It
has lowered its age limit for passengers to 6 months, except for some
cruises in Asia, South America, Africa and India, for which the
minimum is now 12 months.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A new display at the Smithsonian's Arts and Industries Building, on
view through March 15, includes two toy electric trains that chug
through a fantasy world of live plants and miniatures called
Smithsonian Land.</LD>
<LD>   The theme is a whimsical one: With the arrival of locomotives in
the countryside, fairies have taken to the hills, leaving behind an
intricate imaginary world of miniature houses, trains with clanging
bells, bridges, pines and mosses. Open 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily.

<KH>WEEKEND ESCAPE</KH>
<HD>Opening a Door to the Other Tecate</HD>
<DH>There's more to the Mexican town than high-priced Rancho La
Puerta.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE ALVORD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TECATE, Mexico</DL>
<LD>One of my friends, the most seasoned of Mexico travelers, has never
vacationed in Tecate. That's not to say she doesn't know its
reputation. When I said my husband and I were planning a getaway
there, she nodded approvingly.</LD>
<LD>   "To the spa, of course," she said, meaning Rancho La Puerta, where
a week of fitness classes, vegetarian cuisine and metaphysical
pampering starts at more than $4,000 for two.</LD>
<LD>   "No," I said. "Not the spa."</LD>
<TE>   She seemed confused. "Why else," she asked, "would anyone go to
Tecate?"</TE>
<TE>   It's a reasonable question. Many vacationers head for the coastal
resorts with the glitzy reputations. But I wanted to spend a weekend
in a place off the beaten track and closer to home. I wanted to eat
authentic food, dance to salsa music and absorb a little Mexican
history and color, perhaps in the form of ancient rock paintings or a
traditional procession wending through dusty streets to a timeworn
church.</TE>
<TE>   I found many of these things during a pleasant weekend last month
in Tecate--and enjoyed it all without spending much money, thanks to
one of Rancho La Puerta's less expensive neighbors, the Rancho Tecate
Resort &amp; Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   Tecate straddles the U.S.-Mexico border about an hour's drive
southeast of San Diego. Incorporated in 1892, Tecate is among the
oldest cities along the California border but certainly different in
ambience from Tijuana and Mexicali, with their crowds of day-trippers
in search of cheap drinks and bargain trinkets.</TE>
<TE>   This city is cleaner, smaller and easier to negotiate. It's built
on industry and agriculture, with an identity not defined by the
border. After Rancho La Puerta, the town's second claim to fame is
beer. The Tecate brewery's red-and-white billboard and towering
stainless-steel vats can be seen from almost anywhere in the city,
dominating the landscape like a castle.</TE>
<TE>   The area is a magnet for maquiladoras, or foreign-owned factories,
which flourish at an industrial park just outside town and employ
what appears to be a thriving middle class.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say the city isn't gritty. As in many Mexican towns,
sidewalks are cracked, and the curbs are crude. Some of the streets
are dirty, and others are simply dirt. But the people are well
dressed, friendly and seemingly happy to see visitors.</TE>
<TE>   I'd been to Tecate before, charmed by its low-key atmosphere and
surprised by the quality of food at the Rancho Tecate Resort, where I
had stopped for lunch once before. This time I wanted to give the
accommodations a try.</TE>
<TE>   My husband, Jim, and I drove California 94 east from San Diego one
Friday afternoon, arrived at the border (a California town also
called Tecate) about 2 and easily found a place to buy Mexican car
insurance. It's a crime to drive in Mexico without it. For about $32
we got three days of full coverage.</TE>
<TE>   We crossed the border and followed directions the insurance office
gave us: Turn left at the first light, then right on Mexico 3, marked
the road to Ensenada. Getting around Tecate is a lot like a Bing
Crosby-Bob Hope movie. Anything can be found in one of three places:
on the road to Ensenada, the road to Mexicali or the road to Tijuana,
all clearly marked.</TE>
<TE>   For our weekend, we oriented ourselves around two places:
tree-shaded Hidalgo Square, in the center of downtown Tecate, and the
Rancho Tecate Resort, about five miles south on the road to Ensenada.
Our first stop was the Office of Tourism, in a storefront on Hidalgo
Square, where a friendly woman plotted our weekend activities on a
map.</TE>
<TE>   Because it was on the way to our resort, our next stop was Centro
Artisanal, a strip of shops where local artisans make and sell their
wares: handcrafted ceramics, wrought-iron furnishings and delicate
blown glass.</TE>
<TE>   We had no difficulty finding the sprawling resort, which is off
the road to Ensenada and down a palm-lined lane. The lobby in the
hacienda-style main building was dark and elegant, with wood-beam
ceilings and bright, polished tile floors. We checked in, then walked
past the gleaming gold-painted columns and down a few walnut-stained
stairs to the handsome bar. Beyond lay a large restaurant, its tables
draped in white linen.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Tecate was built on the site of a turn-of-the century
winery. A two-story-tall, 30-foot-wide oak barrel from the original
building was left in place and converted into a stairwell in the
hacienda.</TE>
<TE>   Our room ($99 a night) was clean and nicely appointed--not as posh
as a luxury resort hotel but above average for a Mexican town like
Tecate and just as comfortable as any mid-scale hotel in the U.S.
Given the reasonable prices and the nice bar and restaurant, I could
see why the resort is well frequented by maquiladora executives and
local dignitaries. Some weekends, I was told when making
reservations, the 45 rooms (12 in the main hacienda) are completely
booked for corporate events.</TE>
<TE>   During our visit, three weeks before Christmas, the rooms and
grounds were largely empty. No one lay by the pool, the tennis court
looked lonely and the three-hole golf course with rounded greens
strung between sandy fairways saw nary a duffer. But each night, the
restaurant became party central for maquiladora-sponsored holiday
shindigs. The festivities kicked up about 7 p.m. and continued nearly
till dawn.</TE>
<TE>   That was OK on Friday. We happily danced along after dining. On
Saturday night, as we dressed for dinner, the noise filtering up to
our room on the second floor of the hacienda was annoying. We
mentioned the problem (but I didn't disclose I'm a writer) when the
resort manager struck up a conversation during dinner. He snapped his
fingers, and we were given another room in a building far from the
maddening party band.</TE>
<TE>   The food, as on previous visits, was good and not terribly pricey.
We dined there two nights, feasting on filet mignon, carne asada,
shrimp in white sauce and lobster, all delicious and beautifully
presented. With dessert and tip, the bill averaged about $65 per
night, plus drinks.</TE>
<TE>   Our daytime activities were similarly affordable. Mornings in
Tecate are marked by the aroma of freshly baked pastries, so we
started Saturday at El Mejor Pan de Tecate, or Tecate's Best Bread,
where row upon row of goods is stacked on iron racks. We sat on a
patio enjoying coffee and three fruit-stuffed scones--all for $1.30.</TE>
<TE>   Next we hit the Tecate brewery. We were disappointed to learn that
tours had been canceled for the holidays and surprised to see a long
line at the gates nevertheless. A guard explained the attraction:
tickets for beer samples. About 10,000 people show up each month for
this freebie, offered 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday, the
guard said proudly.</TE>
<TE>   After an excellent lunch at La Mision, we left for the ancient
rock paintings of El Vallecito.</TE>
<TE>   El Vallecito, a United Nations World Heritage Site, is near the
town of La Rumorosa, 40 miles east of Tecate on the road to Mexicali.
An easy-to-travel dirt road leads to a rock-strewn wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   The paintings here are geometric designs and stick figures
believed to be about 2,000 years old. No one knows much about the
people who painted them, using local plants and minerals to create
white, red and gold pigments. The Mexican government restricts
visitors to all but a few of the paintings, which are spectral and
eerie.</TE>
<TE>   I awoke early Sunday to explore the gravel roads that crisscross
the resort's 2,000 acres. The paths were perfect for a morning walk
that meandered through trees and overlooked a beautiful valley framed
by brown and purple hills.</TE>
<TE>   When I got back to the room, Jim was dressed for tennis, so we hit
a ball around a cracked court before checking out. Our last adventure
took us back to Hidalgo Square, where every Sunday vendors set out
tables of food and crafts, couples stroll along tree-lined paths and
children follow in the steps of men selling bright balloons.</TE>
<TE>   The town was celebrating the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe,
patron saint of the Americas, with a festive parade. Beautiful young
women adorned in feathers and colorful garb pirouetted to the beat of
drums. Behind them, children carried a portrait of the saint as the
parade wound through the streets to Santa Maria de Guadalupe Church.</TE>
<TE>   Before heading home we stopped for a nice lunch: fish Veracruz, a
club sandwich and sodas at El Tucan, on the road to Tijuana. The trip
wasn't a week at a world-famous spa. But it was fun-filled and
offbeat. And the final tab alone was enough to make us smile.</TE>

<LD>The official name is Anchorage Fur Rendezvous, but the locals call it
simply "Rondy," and it's the biggest winter festival in the state.
Begun in the 1930s, the festival will be held this year from Feb. 8
to 17. It includes such typically Alaskan activities as Eskimo
blanket tosses, dog sled races and a prospectors' ball. Other
highlights are helicopter rides, pancake breakfasts, horse-drawn
carriage rides, fiddle contests and melodramas.</LD>
<LD>   For more information, contact Greater Anchorage Inc., 400 D St.,

<TE>   Denver will honor Buffalo Bill on his birthday with two big
events. The annual birthday party will take place at the city's
oldest saloon and one of Buffalo Bill's favorite bars, the Buckhorn
Exchange Restaurant. The festivities on Feb. 23 will include a
look-alike contest that usually draws a dozen or so Buffalo Bill
ringers, plus Old West gunfights and western music. Reservations are
required for dinner but not for the general milling about. The
following day, the look-alikes and other Bill fans will reconvene at
Buffalo Bill's gravesite at the Buffalo Bill Museum.</TE>

<TE>   The 18th National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, Jan. 26 to Feb. 2 in
Elko, is a jubilee that celebrates contemporary ranching
traditions--far more inclusive than a strictly poetry event. Cowboy
poets from as far away as the Australian bush will participate this
year. Visitors can sign up for workshops in rawhide braiding,
horsehair hitching, western dancing and cooking Apache camp bread and
mutton stew.</TE>
<TE>   Or they can just sit back and enjoy performances by the poets
(including headliners Baxter Black and Waddie Mitchell), storytellers
and western musicians. Reservations are suggested.</TE>

<TE>   The Gasparilla Pirate Fest, Feb. 2 in Tampa, began in 1904 when
local citizens donned costumes to reenact the historic invasion of
the bay by Jose Gaspar. This year hundreds of pirates-for-the-day
will sail into the bay led by the Jose Gasparilla, a fully rigged
pirate galleon, and accompanied by a flotilla of pleasure boats. They
will proceed to "capture" the city and hold a victory parade into
downtown, strewing trinkets as they pass.</TE>

<TE>   You can have a wild time celebrating Mardi Gras in Louisiana
without ever setting foot in New Orleans. Lafayette is just one
alternative where the good times roll with parades, balls, dancing in
the streets and plenty of food from Feb. 8 to 12. The Courir de Mardi
Gras dates to early settlement days and re-creates ceremonial
medieval begging rituals. A caped horseback rider travels from house
to house seeking ingredients for a communal gumbo. Tee Mamou features
400-year-old European chants sung in French. And while most fancy
balls are private, the Southwest Louisiana Mardi Gras Assn. Pageant
and Ball is open to all--and is free.</TE>

<TE>   Brownsville's Charro Days, Feb. 28 to March 3, have paid tribute
to the city's strong Latino heritage and its border location for 65
years. Three parades on three consecutive days, with bands, floats
and tejano and mariachi music, will march over the international
bridge into Matamoros. The indoor merienda is a pageant of
traditional and ornate Mexican dress. At the Sombrero Festival
visitors can enjoy more local music.</TE>

<TE>   Binche, about 34 miles south of Brussels, hosts the country's most
lavish pre-Lent celebrations, Feb. 10 to 12. On the 10th "Mam'selles"
are on parade. From dawn to dusk on the 12th, streets will be filled
with more than 800 local men and boys costumed as "Gille," a
hay-stuffed carnival character with white feathered headdress (some
as high as 4 feet). These Gilles toss oranges to the crowd. Also part
of the tradition: a brass band concert. To learn more about Binche's
carnival tradition, stop by the town's Carnival and Mask Museum.</TE>

<HD>Near Palo Alto, Earthquake Country Offers No-Fault Views</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My first hikes along the San Andreas fault were motivated by a kind
of fatalistic curiosity. But after a while, I began to enjoy the
sheer beauty of earthquake country: the crushed and uplifted rocks,
the jagged stream beds and the long gashes through sweeping
grasslands.</LD>
<LD>   For Californians, it's a shaky common ground. Those of us who live
on the coastal side of the state are on the Pacific Plate, which
drifts north until it hits the North American Plate, thus creating
the San Andreas fault.</LD>
<LD>   The two plates creep past each other an average of 2 inches a
year. The movement isn't consistent, though. The plates often lock
together, and stress builds until--whammo! Energy is released in the
form of earthquakes.</LD>
<TE>   Hikers get a fine introduction to the world of plate tectonics and
continental drift in the hills above Palo Alto. This week I'll
explore several trails in Los Trancos Open Space Preserve and
neighboring Monte Bello Open Space Preserve.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Trancos, nine trailside educational stations are keyed to
an interpretive pamphlet at the trail head. Looping paths also cross
fern-lined Los Trancos Creek and pass old oaks, some of which lost
limbs during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   On clear days, hikers can see downtown San Francisco to the north
and Mt. Diablo across the bay to the east.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: Set out for Los Trancos first. Exit
Interstate 280 at Page Mill Road in Palo Alto and wind seven miles
west to the preserve entrance. The parking lot, on your right, is one
mile east of Skyline Boulevard. If you hit Skyline, you've gone too
far.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: Keep in mind that some signposts may not match trail
maps. That's because signs steer hikers toward end destinations
rather than labeling trails. A sign that says San Andreas Fault
Trail, for example, may not actually mark San Andreas Fault Trail but
rather point hikers toward it.</TE>
<TE>   That said, these trails are pretty well marked, so you're unlikely
to get lost. From the trail head, follow an unnamed connector trail
north for a tenth of a mile to Franciscan Loop Trail. Take this trail
right (east) as it descends into an oak woodland.</TE>
<TE>   For a little detour, after about a quarter-mile turn left
(northwest) and follow a connector trail to the San Andreas Fault
Trail, a loop that's about three-quarters of a mile.</TE>
<TE>   Back on Franciscan Loop, the trail crosses a bridge over Los
Trancos Creek and half a mile later rises to a junction with Lost
Creek Loop Trail.</TE>
<TE>   Join this loop heading northwest (at first) for slightly more than
half a mile, passing a junction with northbound Page Mill Trail and
briefly joining a segment of Lost Creek that also serves as
southbound Page Mill Trail. Keep right (south) on Lost Creek, then
turn right (west) back onto Franciscan Loop Trail. Travel past old
oaks and into grassy meadows. Another right (south) turn onto a
connector trail will lead back to the parking area.</TE>
<TE>   Another good place to hike is neighboring Monte Bello Open Space
Preserve, whose parking lot lies almost directly across the street
from Los Trancos' parking area. Monte Bello, which means "beautiful
mountain" in Italian, is just that: a handsome, 2,700-foot-high ridge
cut by creeks, green with grass and cloaked with oak and fir. It's
inspiring scenery.</TE>
<TE>   The preserve's main path is Stevens Creek Nature Trail, which
starts by the parking lot. The trail tours a variety of landscapes:
grassland, chaparral, evergreen forests. A close-up view of the San
Andreas fault is particularly illuminating. Fault movement has
produced two soil systems and thus two plant communities: woodland on
one side, brush and grass on the other.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens Creek Nature Trail also explores a cattail-lined sag pond,
a topographic depression created by the fault. Interpretive stations
discuss ladybugs, Douglas firs and California's official state rock,
bluish-gray serpentine.</TE>
<TE>   The preserve also offers a couple of longer trails that go into
upper Stevens Creek Canyon and ascend Monte Bello's high ridge.</TE>

<HD>On the Web, Buyers Face a Fee-Finding Mission</HD>
<DH>Comparing air fares is hard when sellers aren't upfront
with add-on costs. And DOT's new rules may not help all consumers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internet is the latest playing field in the tug-of-war over how
service fees and other add-ons should be presented to buyers of
airline tickets.</LD>
<LD>   One team is made up of Web travel seller Orbitz and its
supporters. On the other team, so far, are competitor Travelocity and
a group of travel agents. The U.S. Department of Transportation is
the referee. And the fraying rope is us, the traveling public.</LD>
<LD>   What's at stake is how we shop for bargains and compare deals.</LD>
<TE>   In the last two months there has been a flurry of petitions and
responses filed with the DOT over Internet service fees on airline
tickets. On Dec. 3, Orbitz, the site owned by five airlines that made
its debut in June and quickly became one of the top-10 Internet
travel sellers, announced it was phasing in a service fee of $5 per
airline ticket. It asked to be exempt from the DOT's long-standing
ban on travel sellers listing service fees separately from air fares.</TE>
<TE>   Just four days later, saying the "public interest" required it to
act without allowing the normal time for public comment, the DOT
granted the exemption for Orbitz. On Dec. 19 it issued a revised
policy that lets all Internet travel sellers list their fees
separately, unlike offline travel agents, who are supposed to abide
by the old rules.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the confusion, the new DOT policy states that it doesn't
apply to airlines even though they typically sell tickets on their
own Web sites. When I asked DOT spokesman Bill Mosley to clarify, he
said airlines aren't considered Internet travel sellers for the
purpose of the decision.</TE>
<TE>   A week later Travelocity filed a petition asking the DOT to
reconsider, accusing the federal agency of inconsistency and Orbitz
of violating the revised policy.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 4, Radius, a worldwide consortium of more than 100 travel
agencies, entered the fray, saying the DOT's revised policy
discriminates against consumers and traditional travel agents. And on
Jan. 7, Orbitz fired off a response to Travelocity's petition,
accusing it of having an "unsavory agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Internet travel titan Expedia, which doesn't charge service fees,
stayed on the sidelines. But in public comments, it criticized
Orbitz's new fee as anticonsumer--even as Expedia itself, on Dec. 4,
was fined $40,000 by the DOT for listing fares that excluded
so-called fuel surcharges from one of its search paths. The
surcharges, which airlines began imposing in 2000 to compensate for
higher fuel costs, are about $20 each way. The DOT requires all
travel sellers to include them in quoted fares. (Expedia says it is
now in compliance.)</TE>
<TE>   Why so much angst about $5? It can make a difference. In a recent
survey that ran 60 simultaneous Internet fare searches on Orbitz,
Expedia and Travelocity plus 10 airline-owned sites, Orbitz beat or
tied the lowest fare 73% of the time, according to Thomas Weisel
Partners, the investment bankers who conducted the survey as part of
their ongoing research. But when the survey factored in the $5
service fee, Orbitz's score fell to 56%.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, each party in these conflicting filings claims
to be acting in consumers' interest. But which really is?</TE>
<TE>   Of Orbitz and Travelocity, online expert Henry Harteveldt, a
senior analyst with Forrester Research, says: "Both companies could
probably do a better job of communicating fees to the public."</TE>
<TE>   The new DOT policy allows Orbitz and other Internet travel sellers
to post service fees on their home page or in a pop-up box linked to
the home page. In Orbitz's case, this note appeared on the home page
when I checked it Jan. 15: "Orbitz Services and Fees. Learn the
latest." I clicked on the note, and a pop-up announced the amount of
the fees. When I used the "quick flight search" to find fares, the
fare appeared in bold type, followed by lighter type with the fee and
total.</TE>
<TE>   Why not just list the fee on the home page? Customers surveyed
"said it was not necessary to see it on the home page," says
spokeswoman Carol Jouzaitis. And Orbitz wants to keep its design
uncluttered, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, she adds, Orbitz is more upfront than its competitors. On
the latter she has a point.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what my own survey of travel sites on Jan. 15 showed:</TE>
<TE>   * Travelocity, www.travelocity.com, didn't have a service fee
except for Northwest Airlines tickets. The $10 fee was not listed on
the home page.</TE>
<TE>   But when a search turned up a Northwest fare, the fee notice
appeared three times, once with a red exclamation mark. Why was it
not on the home page? Spokesman Al Comeaux says Travelocity defines
"upfront" as "the first time you see the price."</TE>
<TE>   * Trip.com, www.trip.com, didn't list a service fee on the home
page either. Until recently it charged a $10-per-ticket service fee
plus a $5 "processing fee." On Dec. 20, a day after the DOT issued
its new policy, it dropped those fees. (The timing was a coincidence,
says spokeswoman Dawn Lyon.) But like several sites, it separately
charged fees for issuing paper tickets, and it had extra fees for
cancellations. To find these, I had to do a search, then click on
"service fees" by the itinerary I wanted, which called up a pop-up
box listing 15 possible fees. "Our goal is certainly not to make it
[fees] confusing," Lyon says.</TE>
<TE>   * Cheap Seats Travel, www.cheapseatstravel.com, also didn't list
fees on its home page. When I searched for air fares, it took three
mouse clicks (including a display of fares without the fee) to arrive
at the service fee, listed in smaller type next to my chosen
itinerary: "USD 10.00 Processing Fee per ticket." Company President
Tom Spagnola's comment about this: "We really can't quote the
processing fee until the people agree to the price of the ticket, I
guess."</TE>
<TE>   * Cheap Tickets, www.cheaptickets.com, didn't display fees on its
home page. Its "Express Search" showed a $3.95 "order processing fee"
when it first displayed fares. Its "Power Search," which finds fares
"excluding surcharges, fees &amp; taxes," according to a note on the home
page, did just that, adding the service fee later when I checked if
seats were available.</TE>
<TE>   Fee, fee, who's got the fee? It's not a fun game for consumers.</TE>
<TE>   As for offline travel agencies represented by the Radius filing,
they also have a point: The playing field is not equal for online and
offline sellers, making it hard for consumers to know who is offering
the best deal. If offline sellers appear to be charging higher prices
because they wrap in fees, "travelers will remove their business from
travel agencies," the filing says.</TE>
<TE>   Who hasn't weighed in on this issue yet? The traveling public. But
you can do so by visiting the DOT's document site, dms.dot.gov. Click
on "Search" and enter the last five digits (11086) of Docket No.
OST-01-11086 to read the filings so far. Click on "Help" on the home
page for instructions on how to make your views known.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, we consumers will need to follow the "Buyer, beware"
dictum. And to that add a new one: "Find the fees."</TE>

<LD>John Pregil knows he's one lucky guy.</LD>
<LD>   Not only does he live in paradise, but he also has figured out how
to earn a living doing what he loves most, which is meeting people
from all over the world. He is guaranteed all the action and
excitement he wants. Even better, his wife and children can sometimes
tag along.</LD>
<LD>   When Pregil isn't on duty as a Honolulu firefighter, he can
usually be found on a nearly deserted beach at Barbers Point, about
20 minutes west of Waikiki, teaching tourists how to surf. Pregil and
two other surf-loving firefighters, Garrett Valles and Kevin Miller,
launched the Hawaiian Fire Surf School a little less than two years
ago and employ other off-duty firefighters to teach. All are trained
in first aid, CPR and open-water rescue, and they all have years of
lifeguard experience. Call Hawaiian Fire at (808) 384-8855 or visit
www.hawnfire.com.</LD>
<TE>   "We all grew up surfing," Pregil says. "It was something we did on
the weekends. You go to the beach with your families, and you hang
out and go surfing. It's an attitude."</TE>
<TE>   That ultra-cool surfer's attitude is exactly why kids who visit
Hawaii want to learn to surf.</TE>
<TE>   My kids couldn't wait to give surfing a try--after they had bought
the "right" surfer shorts and shirts, of course.</TE>
<TE>   There are certainly plenty of opportunities to learn surfing in
Hawaii, especially in Waikiki, where surf lessons have been offered
since before World War II. And these days, with fewer tourists on the
beach, your kids will get all the personal attention they could want
from teachers who are eager to introduce youngsters to the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Mokuahi is licensed by the state to teach surfing and has been
doing so for decades.</TE>
<TE>   He charges $20 for a 60-minute lesson and is stationed just
outside the Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "If you know how to swim, you can learn to surf," Mokuahi says.
"Just make sure you go with someone who knows what they are doing."</TE>
<TE>   Farther down the beach, legendary Hawaiian surfer Hans Hedemann,
who spent 17 years surfing competitively all over the world, runs his
surf school in the shadow of Diamond Head. Kids account for about a
quarter of his students, he says, and some come for lessons every day
they're on the island. Call the Hans Hedemann Surf School at (808)
924-7778 or visit www.hhsurf.com.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents set up a class for the kids, and then [the parents] want
to go," Hedemann says. "Moms jump in there and give it a shot."</TE>
<TE>   I did, though not too successfully, I must admit.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawaiian Fire Surf School van picked us up at our hotel just
after breakfast and equipped us with everything we would need for the
day. The school charges $79 for adults, less for kids, and lunch is
included.</TE>
<TE>   "We get you out of Waikiki so you won't be around all the surfers
who don't know what they're doing," Pregil told us. "We can keep a
close eye on you here."</TE>
<TE>   That sounded good to me. The waves were gentle too. There's only
one drawback: If you (or the kids) aren't having fun, there's no
escape until the lesson is over several hours later.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't a problem for us. The instructors reminded me of the
instructors at a ski resort, enthusiastic and eager to introduce
novices to their sport.</TE>
<TE>   "Surfing is very spiritual in Hawaii," Pregil says. "It's like
you're at one with the ocean. This is where surfing began, and
Hawaiian surfers are very proud of that and glad to be able to help
pass it on."</TE>
<TE>   The session began with a safety lesson on the beach. (Never dive
into the water headfirst.) Then we learned how to position ourselves
on the board. After that we surfed alongside the instructors till we
dropped onto the beach in exhaustion. We learned that the hardest
part wasn't balancing ourselves on the board but paddling out to
catch the waves.</TE>
<TE>   The good news was that everyone who tried--even the 50-somethings
in the group--managed to get up on their boards. I'd never seen such
a happy, sand-covered, waterlogged group. There were even smiles on
the faces of those who wouldn't have come if not for their kids'
urging.</TE>
<TE>   "I got up for two seconds," said a pleased Tanya Bastillos, who
was with her 13-year-old daughter. "I thought I'd hate it, but I want
to do it again."</TE>
<TE>   This could be the year you and the kids join the Hawaiian surfing
scene, because a trip to the islands is affordable. Before booking,
ask about deals that include rental cars, free breakfasts, kids'
activities and, most important, free nights with a certain minimum
number of nights booked. (Visit www.gohawaii.com, the state's
official tourism site.) Even luxury hotels are offering discounted
packages.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a sampling of what's out there:</TE>
<TE>   * Pleasant Holidays, a charter company that sends more than
400,000 tourists to Hawaii each year, has six-day air/hotel packages
from the West Coast starting at $399 a person. There are also
packages offering substantial discounts at condos and luxury hotels.
Call (800) 2-HAWAII (242-9244) or visit www.pleasantholidays.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Book an Aston condo or hotel from January until June and get one
free night for every three nights paid. Aston operates 35 condo
resorts and hotels on four islands. Call (800) 92-ASTON (922-7866) or
visit www.astonhotels.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Outrigger hotels and their more moderately priced division, the
Ohana hotel group, offer various specials depending on the property.
There are free snorkeling lessons for kids at the Outrigger Waikiki
on the Beach and free kids' activities at the Outrigger Wailea Resort
on Maui. Subject to availability, discounted Ohana rates start at $69
in Waikiki, $99 on Maui. Call (800) 688-7444 or visit
www.outrigger.com.</TE>
<TE>   * At Destination Resorts Hawaii in Wailea on Maui, luxury condos
large enough for a family start at $165 a night. Call (800) 367-5246
or visit www.destinationresortshi.com.</TE>

<HD>For Schoolchildren, Field Trips Are a Preview of Life's
Yellow Brick Road</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES TRAVEL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a way, my travels started in the fourth grade in St. Louis when I
went on a school field trip to nearby Springfield, Ill., the home and
burial place of Abraham Lincoln. I don't remember the modest house
where three of Lincoln's sons were born or the Old State Capitol. But
I can still see the gleaming yellow school bus that took me and my
classmates on the adventure, as potent to me then as Dorothy's ruby
slippers.</LD>
<LD>   This school trip and others seeded my desire to see the world.
"Children get a sense of independence and discover that they are
citizens of the world," says Margaret Bowles, associate head of
academic affairs at Viewpoint, a private K-12 school in Calabasas,
who has taken school groups as far afield as China.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, school trips teach children how to handle themselves
away from their parents, how to eat in a restaurant and behave during
a lecture. "A lot is learned in terms of life skills," says Vincent
Ferrandino, executive director of the National Assn. of Elementary
School Principals in Alexandria, Va.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, the real purpose of a school trip is to teach children
about a specific subject--colonial America in Williamsburg, Va.;
ecology in the Channel Islands; the animal world at the San Diego
Zoo. Educators say such trips are an important part of school
curricula at all levels. My mother, who taught middle school social
studies for 20 years, says trips give children a chance to see and
hear what their teacher has been telling them about, bringing to life
subjects as varied as geology and government.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Jane Collier, principal of Ivanhoe Elementary in Los Angeles,
who accompanied 60 fifth-graders last year on a four-day trip to
Washington, D.C., says that children become especially alert to
learning when they're out of the classroom and confronted with new
faces and places.</TE>
<TE>   At Viewpoint school, children from fourth to 12th grade go on a
big trip every year. These include at least one night away from
home--three-day Astrocamp at the Desert Sun Science Center in
Idyllwild for fifth-graders, four days on Catalina Island for
sixth-graders and the eighth-grade plum, a six-day geology and
ecology program at Yosemite.</TE>
<TE>   Westland, a private elementary school in L.A., starts 6- and
7-year-olds with short trips to farms, dairies, restaurants and
stores to see how food comes to the table. It requires parents to
serve as chauffeurs on two trips a year.</TE>
<TE>   Moms and dads can enrich their children's education during family
vacations, but school trips are usually specifically designed with
learning in mind. "The purpose of the trip has to be embedded in the
curriculum. It's not just see as we go," says Sylvia Seidel, a
director at the National Education Assn. in Washington, D.C. This
means preparing children before they take a field trip and reflecting
together on the experience afterward. For instance, you could make
kids read a play before they see it, then have them try to write one
when they return from the theater. "If the experience is isolated,
it's less useful," Seidel says.</TE>
<TE>   At Mission San Francisco Solano in Sonoma, Calif., 13,000
fourth-graders a year augment their classroom state history studies
by learning how Native Americans who lived at the mission in the
early 19th century cooked, wove baskets, made candles and spun wool.
Most school visits there last just a few hours, but the teachers of
some lucky students arrange for them to participate in an overnight
environmental studies program. To prepare for this special study
course, instructors must attend a daylong workshop at the mission
before the trip.</TE>
<TE>   Planning and executing school excursions, particularly when they
include long-distance travel and overnights, are complicated. Some
schools shy away from big trips because of liability concerns. After
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many school excursions were canceled
because of safety concerns, say staff members at such popular
destinations as Colonial Williamsburg and Springfield, Ill. Then,
too, school trips cost money, which is seldom readily available,
especially at cash-strapped public schools. The L.A. Unified School
District does not budget for field trips, although it provides
schools with discretionary funds that may be used for excursions,
most of which are day trips.</TE>
<TE>   It's largely up to parents to pay or raise funds for multi-day
excursions such as Ivanhoe's trip to Washington and Viewpoint's
Yosemite adventure, which costs about $500 per student. As a matter
of policy, both schools see that all children get a chance to take
the trip, even if the parents can't afford it. To do so, schools
sometimes tap discretionary funds and kids sell candy or hold car
washes. Ivanhoe principal Collier says that parents "do a lot of
fund-raising."</TE>
<TE>   Parents are also often tapped to chaperon school excursions. Deb
Pfiffner, a mother of three in Burke, Va., went on four trips to New
York City with her then-high school daughter, Megan, and schoolmates
to study marketing at fashion houses and theme restaurants. "Some
went just to get out of school," Pfiffner says, "but they still had
to do all the activities. All their time was booked." Consequently,
even the class-dodgers had little opportunity to run amok.</TE>
<TE>   Janie Lou Hirsch, director at Westland School, says that kids who
take only one school trip a year are the most likely to act out on
field trips. When children are accustomed to spending time outside
the classroom, they learn to behave in public.</TE>
<TE>   So field trips are valuable for a host of reasons. It isn't a
modest proposal, I know. But is it too much to ask for every child to
have a chance to see Washington, D.C., and the Grand Canyon?</TE>

<LD>You can nod off in the snowy Alps and, saving yourself the cost of a
hotel room, wake up on the sunny shore of the Mediterranean. Riding
the rails in Europe is not always the least expensive transportation,
but because the rail network is extensive, service is frequent and
specially priced passes are available to people younger than 26, many
young travelers have always found it attractive. Several new youth
rail passes have been introduced this year.</LD>
<LD>   If you want to hit the highlights of Paris, Florence, Venice and
Rome, there's the new France 'n Italy Youthpass, offering unlimited
second-class rail travel throughout these two popular countries. The
pass is valid for travel on any four days within a two-month period
for $199. Additional days, up to a maximum of six, can be purchased
for $21 each. Two-country passes are a new trend that travelers will
see more often in the future, rail companies say.</LD>
<TE>   The new Swiss Youth Pass is valid for consecutive days of
unlimited travel on national rail, lake steamers and transportation
services in 36 Swiss cities. This pass is honored on some postal
buses and selected private railways, such as the Glacier Express and
the Panoramic Express. It is also valid for 25% discounts for many
mountaintop excursions and entrance to the Lausanne Olympic Museum.
The passes are available for first- or second-class service. A
four-day pass costs $184 first class, $120 second class; eight days
is $255 first class, $169 second class; 15 days is $308 first class,
$203 second class; 22 days is $357 first class, $237 second class;
and one month of travel is $402 first class, $263 second class.</TE>
<TE>   With the new Italy Flexi Rail Card Youth, you don't have to travel
on consecutive days. Each card is valid for a specified number of
days of second-class travel, which must be used within a one-month
period. A four-day pass costs $159, eight days is $223 and 12 days is
$286. Passholders are also eligible for special fares on Artesia
Premier Trains and for ferry service to Sicily.</TE>
<TE>   Also geared to cost-cutting young travelers is the new
second-class European East Pass, valid for five days of unlimited
travel in Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland
within one month. It costs $154, plus $18 for each additional day.</TE>
<TE>   To see if a pass will be a good value, log on to the Rail Europe
Internet site at www.raileurope.com and run through the fares and
schedules, comparing youth point-to-point fares with passes for the
region you want to explore. Keep in mind that on many routes, if you
board an overnight train after 7 p.m., only the next day is deducted
from your pass.</TE>
<TE>   The youth passes must be purchased before you travel to Europe.
You must be younger than 26 on your first day of travel, and you must
begin using your pass within six months of its purchase. Remember
that not every train has second-class service and that reservations
for high-speed trains and berths for overnight journeys cost extra.
To avoid surprises, study with a travel agent the schedules of routes
you are likely to travel before you buy a pass.</TE>
<TE>   On the Rail Europe site you'll also find details on other 2002
rail passes that offer special rates for travelers younger than 26.
These include the traditional 17-country Eurailpass, the Europass,
the Eurail Select Pass, BritRail Classic Youth Pass, BritRail
Flexipass Youth, France Youthpass, German Rail Youth Pass, Greek
Flexipass Rail 'n Fly Youth and the Holland Junior Rail Pass. Foreign
student travel services also sell youth point-to-point international
rail fares and passes that can be purchased after arrival. To find
addresses for such services, log on to www.istc.org.</TE>
<TE>   Other travelers can be a good source of advice. On the Graffiti
Wall (message board) at www.ricksteves.com or at Lonely Planet's
Thorn Tree (www.lonelyplanet.com) you'll find shared information
about trains. Recently a Canadian traveler related her experience on
a rail trip in Eastern Europe: "I had a second-class ticket ... and
once my train hit the border from Hungary to Romania the lights and
heat went out in all of the second-class cars. I woke up shivering! I
moved to the first-class car and paid the ticket man $10 to stay in
first class for the remainder of my trip. The lights and heat
remained on in first class."</TE>

<LD>The Travel section is the primary reason my husband and I subscribe
to the Sunday Los Angeles Times. We have discovered several
interesting trips through the myriad articles we've perused.
Christopher Reynolds' accounting of his Oxford experience, "Oxford
Lite" (Jan. 14, 2001), was one such article, and we set about
following his footsteps to Christ Church.</LD>
<LD>   We found Professor Chandrika Kaul's course, "The Rise and Fall of
the British Empire, 1765 to Present," exhilarating and interesting,
not the galloping experience Reynolds wrote about. She is an
excellent instructor and adroit with her subject matter. It was
obvious then and even more so after reading Reynolds' recent article
("Looking Back, Going Forward," Dec. 30), that he does not possess a
wealth of experiences or knowledge.</LD>
<LD>   Our accommodations at Christ Church were luxurious--new with
private bath--on the ground floor of Meadows Quad. We were expecting
college food and were delightfully amazed at the quality and
ingenuity of the Oxford chef. The wines and meals were delicious and
our housing outstanding. It was such a grand experience that we are
determined to return for more courses.</LD>
<TE>   I am compelled to contest Reynolds' reference to the food being
"murky and mysterious" in the Great Hall at Christ Church. Any person
whose culinary expertise is so narrow as to choose sashimi as a
yardstick for a chef's abilities defies description.</TE>
<TE>   I strongly suggest that you find writers who are more well read
and well traveled, especially if you are paying them very much.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Just a Few Rows of Seats and a World Away From the Usual
Mode of Travel," Her World, Jan. 13: I too have had the pleasure of a
complimentary upgrade to first class and was initially puzzled about
why they chose me.</LD>
<LD>   A few years ago I was returning to my university in Guadalajara,
Mexico, after being home for the holidays. When I checked my luggage
I spoke in Spanish to the ticket counter attendants, as I had guessed
they would be bilingual (and I can always use the practice). A few
moments later I received my upgrade. Upon boarding the plane I was
directed to a roomy seat next to a sweet Mexican grandmother whose
children had arranged to send her home in first class. I looked
around and noticed that all the other first-class passengers were
Anglo men in business suits. When the flight attendants began to
offer refreshments, I discovered that none in first class spoke
Spanish, so I ended up translating for the woman during the four-hour
flight, which I surmise was the reason for my upgrade. If so, it was
well worth it. Any time I can be of service in first class in the
future, I will happily oblige.</LD>

<LD>I am compelled to respond to the letter "More Hotel Fee Add-Ons"
(Dec. 30), regarding "resort fees." I am strongly opposed to this
type of inflammatory pricing, which gives many of us in the
hospitality business a black eye.</LD>
<LD>   All too often, these add-on fees are not disclosed when a
reservation is placed. At that time the customer needs to ask, "Are
there any additional fees or charges?"</LD>
<LD>   I trust that the fees letter writer Sally Cullen was charged were
disclosed on the registration form she signed at check-in. If not, we
encourage her to dispute the additional charges with her credit card
company.</LD>

<CP>PHOTO: The trick, explained 15-year-old Marshall Hope of Los
Alamitos, was getting close to the ostrich but not too close. "I
didn't want it to peck at the camera and ruin it," he said. Marshall
was visiting Solvang with his parents when they came upon Ostrich
Land, a nearby farm that sells hand-painted ostrich eggs,
ostrich-feather key chains and (say it ain't so!) ostrich jerky.
Marshall, who aspires to be a professional nature photographer,
positioned himself about 2 feet from the bird, then waited. "He just
stuck his head up at the right second, and I clicked it."</CP>

<DH>'The Jamie Kennedy Experiment' and 'Glory Days' introduce
the WB's young adult viewers to vintage TV fare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though the new WB series "JKX: The Jamie Kennedy Experiment" and
"Glory Days" are geared for the teen and young adult audience the
network has cultivated, the shows actually are throwbacks to vintage
TV genres.</LD>
<LD>   "With both 'Jamie Kennedy' and 'Glory Days,' we are trying to do
something that has been sort of standard operating procedure at the
WB since Day 1, which is to identify durable programming genres that
have not been reintroduced to younger adult audiences," says Jordan
Levin, president of entertainment for the WB.</LD>
<LD>   In the case of "Jamie Kennedy," which can be seen Sundays at 8
p.m., the half-hour series is "introducing the practical joke-variety
show and the 'Candid Camera' format. And with 'Glory Days,' it is
introducing a real old-fashioned murder mystery-whodunit that has
been really popular on CBS, but hasn't gotten aged down." Both shows
were introduced last week.</LD>
<TE>   "Glory Days," shown Wednesdays at 9 p.m., is the second series for
the WB from executive producer and creator Kevin Williamson, of
"Dawson's Creek" and the "Scream" movies. Eddie Cahill plays Mike
Dolan, a young novelist who returns to his hometown of Glory after
"loosely" basing his best-selling murder mystery on the events
surrounding his father's accidental death. The beautiful Pacific
Northwest town is filled with murder and other grisly goings on.
Every week, Dolan, the coroner (Poppy Montgomery) and the sheriff
(Jay R. Ferguson) will be solving a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, it is a very bare bones whodunit, but the
whodunits are creepy and the characters are a little quirky," Levin
says. "There is a very contained sense of what this town is and the
rules it organizes itself by, which has a little bit of 'Northern
Exposure' and 'Picket Fences' to it."</TE>
<TE>   As well as a dash of "Twin Peaks." Williamson, though, is quick to
note that "Glory Days" is much more accessible than the cult David
Lynch series.</TE>
<TE>   Williamson's original concept for the series was a coming-of-age
soap opera with a lot of weird happenings in the town of Glory. It
was WB executives, he says, who suggested introducing murder. "They
said, 'You wanted things to happen; how weird can you take it?'" he
says. "I am discovering week to week how weird we can go. So it is
sort of evolving."</TE>
<TE>   Some episodes of the 13-week series are straight-ahead mysteries,
says Williamson, whereas others are quirky and emotional. "We keep
everything sort of relatable," he says. "In order to make it
accessible and real, we have weird stuff happen, but we try to
scientifically explain it. But if we can't, we sort of leave it up to
the audience."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "Jamie Kennedy," says Levin, "we wanted to do a
personality-driven vehicle. We didn't want to do something that was
ultimately mean-spirited. We wanted to do something that really
blended a lot of different programming forms--a celebrity-driven,
non-scripted vehicle in the sort of variety show type of vein."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, a stand-up comic who has appeared in "Scream" and "Three
Kings," is having a ball playing everyone from a Malibu rapper
meeting his girlfriend's disapproving mother and sister to an
executive who has had major jaw surgery, trying to conduct an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a huge fan of 'Candid Camera' and 'Saturday Night Live,'"
Kennedy says. "Peter Sellers is my idol, and [like him] I love
playing many different characters. This show is a good chance to do
it. We get to act off of real people."</TE>
<TE>   "JKX: The Jamie Kennedy Experiment" can be seen Sundays at 8 p.m.,
"Glory Days" Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on the WB. The network has rated
this week's episode of "Jamie Kennedy" TV-PG-D-L (may be unsuitable
for younger children, with an advisory for suggestive dialogue and
coarse language) and "Glory Days" TV-PG-V (may be unsuitable for
younger children, with an advisory for violence).</TE>

<HD>A Committee-Like Approach</HD>
<DH>AFC: Ravens have rushed for more than 200 yards in each of
their last two games by sharing the duties among three running backs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRENT JONES</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>OWINGS MILLS, Md.</DL>
<LD>They have turned a phrase with a negative connotation into a positive
approach.</LD>
<LD>   ''Running back by committee'' usually means no player stands above
the rest and often ends in griping, but the Baltimore Ravens have
used Terry Allen, Jason Brookins and Moe Williams to forge a mauling
offensive identity similar to the one that led to a remarkable
playoff run last season.</LD>
<LD>   The Ravens have rushed for more than 200 yards the past two games,
with the trio combining for 41 carries Sunday in the first-round
playoff win over the Miami Dolphins and 37 carries the week before
against the Minnesota Vikings.</LD>
<TE>   Because of injuries to Allen, then Brookins, it was the first time
the three played in back-to-back games since mid-October losses at
Green Bay and at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   ''Nobody likes to do it running back by committee,'' Ravens coach
Brian Billick said. ''The player doesn't. The lead back doesn't. Even
as a coach, you'd like to have your guy in there. But this is the way
it is going to be for us, and everybody is comfortable with that
role.</TE>
<TE>   ''Given the way we've run the ball, I can't imagine it working
much better than that.''</TE>
<TE>   Those games came against an awful run defense in the Vikings (30th
in the NFL) and a below-average run defense from Miami (17th). Now,
the Ravens will face the league's best in stopping the run in
Sunday's divisional playoff game at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   ''It is a challenge, and I think we are ready for it,'' Allen
said. ''In fact, I know we are ready for it. We've wanted to run the
ball all year. They've started to give us the ball, and we've been
doing well with it. We're not going to give them any reason to take
it away from us.''</TE>
<TE>   Allen unquestionably is the chairman of the committee. He has
rushed for back-to-back 100-yard games for the first time since 1994,
with 133 against the Vikings and 109 against Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Brookins, in his first two games back since breaking a bone in his
foot, added 15 and 65 yards, respectively, while Williams has a
combined 73 yards.</TE>
<TE>   ''A lot of people said that this wouldn't work,'' Brookins said.
''But this is what is getting us to the playoffs. This is carrying us
to the ultimate goal. When Jamal (open bracket)Lewis(close bracket)
went down, people were saying, 'Where are they going to go?' Then
Terry came in, and it seems to be working. So we are not going to try
and fix it.''</TE>
<TE>   Allen's hard-nosed style -- he's routinely carried linebackers
into the secondary in the past two games -- has boosted the offense.</TE>
<TE>   He rushed for 4 yards or more 10 times on first down against
Miami, which consistently put the Ravens in manageable situations.</TE>
<TE>   ''He has a great desire to get to the Super Bowl, and he is going
to give it everything he has,'' running backs coach Matt Simon said.
''I think a lot of guys recognize his undying passion to achieve
that, and they have a compassionate respect for it.</TE>
<TE>   ''It is huge because, No. 1, they are all able to feed off each
other. With Terry's lead, and their youthfulness, they've created a
good combination for us and keep us with some fresh legs.''</TE>
<TE>   Brookins, about 25 pounds heavier than Allen, runs in a strictly
straight-ahead style. Williams is the one with the speed to run
outside.</TE>
<TE>   Allen is the only NFL player ever to come back from two
reconstructive knee surgeries, and his quest to get to his first
Super Bowl is one of the feel-good stories of the playoffs. But he
does not see it as such.</TE>
<TE>   He had a minor blowup in the locker room Wednesday when questions
about his age kept coming up. Allen, 33, settled down and gave a
passionate explanation of why his age is nothing but a number.</TE>
<TE>   ''Who cares? Players are going to play regardless of how old, how
young,'' Allen said. ''Are they talking about rookies that come in
and play well? I'm getting tired of people talking about my age. Let
it go.</TE>
<TE>   ''Why does it matter? Why, why, why? So what, I'm 33. I'm going to
retire after this year, so I can quit listening to this.''</TE>
<TE>   Brookins came in at that point and told Allen he would be back for
another season, an example of the kind of encouragement the backs
give each other on the field.</TE>
<TE>   ''These guys have taken on the same philosophical approach that it
is about team and not one guy,'' Simon said. ''And it is all for the
good of the group as opposed to the glory of one.''</TE>
<TE>   For the first time this season, the Ravens will enter the Steelers
game with all of their running backs healthy.</TE>
<TE>   Allen missed the first game at Pittsburgh with an ankle injury,
and Brookins missed the rematch Dec. 16. In the latter, the Ravens
had just 15 total rushes, a number they will need to at least double
Sunday. With the trio healthy, they have a chance.</TE>
<TE>   ''It takes all three, we know that,'' Billick said. ''We knew that
coming into it. That is where, you remember a couple of weeks ago, my
optimism in our abilities to do well in the playoffs was based on the
fact that at the right time, fatefully, us getting healthy. And guys
understanding what it is we needed them to do. They've got a good
feel on how this rotation should work.''</TE>

<HD>Selig Gets Washington's Attention for Relocation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BOSWELL</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bud Selig certainly got Washington's attention this week.</LD>
<LD>   It's amazing how your tune changes when the heat gets high enough.</LD>
<LD>   ''There's no doubt in my mind that relocation is coming,'' the
baseball commissioner said Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Of Washington, he said, ''given the demographics of the area and
all the people who want it, they are the prime candidate.''</TE>
<TE>   As they say in diplomacy, that is a policy shift. If local fans
want to get enthusiastic, it's somewhat justified. When Selig speaks
about franchise movements, it's supposed to carry a great deal of
weight. That's the one area in baseball that's always been at the
center of a commissioner's influence.</TE>
<TE>   However, Selig's word has seldom been a particularly valuable
bond. His statement Thursday, while provocative, hardly constitutes a
promise. The ''prime candidate'' doesn't always win.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Selig, and baseball, are clearly reacting to the intense
criticism they've received lately. The game's antitrust exemption is
being scrutinized by Congress. Almost daily, Selig seems to get
caught in some new conflict-of-interest imbroglio.</TE>
<TE>   All of a sudden, keeping Peter Angelos happy doesn't seem so
important. Indemnifying the Orioles may be the least of Selig's
problems.</TE>
<TE>   So, what's in the cards for Washington? According to highly placed
management sources, there are two scenarios in which the Washington
area ends up with a team.</TE>
<TE>   If everything turns out exactly as Selig and his owners prefer, a
team would relocate to Washington for the 2003 season. That team
would almost certainly be the Florida Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how it comes down.</TE>
<TE>   ''There's a big picture here. All these things are tied together
in a meaningful way,'' Selig said this week.</TE>
<TE>   Selig's ''big picture'' plan has one fundamental tenet. All of
baseball's current owners--the guys who pay him his $3 million
salary--get to feed at the trough before anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   Any new players--such as the potential ownership groups in
Washington and Northern Virginia--only get to join the monopolistic
lodge if all else fails.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry, a lodge member in good standing, was unhappy as the
Marlins owner. Taxpayers wouldn't build him a new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   So, baseball put together a Good-Old-Boys group, with Henry at its
head, to buy the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   That deal went through on Wednesday for $660 million. Sounds like
a lot. It's not. A group headed by Miles Prentice offered $755
million and one led by Cablevision chairman Charles Dolan bid $750
million.</TE>
<TE>   At the last minute, with the Massachusetts attorney general
threatening to hold up the deal, the Henry group coughed up an</TE>
<TE>   extra $40 million for the Yawkey Trust charities. Even so, charity
will receive $70 million less from the Henry group than it would have
from Dolan. Welcome to Bud's World. The attorney general said he took
the deal to ''avoid two years in court.''</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the next part of the puzzle. Montreal Expos owner
Jeffrey Loria will buy the Marlins from Henry. That deal is as good
as done and should be completed within days. The assumption inside
baseball is that Loria will try, as Henry did, to get a publicly
financed stadium in Miami. When he fails, he'll say he ''tried
everything.''</TE>
<TE>   Then, after the '02 season, Loria will move the team to
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Studying baseball is like Kremlinology. You have to connect the
data points. It sure seems as if somebody has promised the D.C.
market to Loria. He's clearly overpaying Henry for the Marlins ($158
million). The franchise might be worth $100 million on the open
market. And baseball is overpaying Loria for the Montreal franchise
(about $120 million). But the game isn't overpaying him by $30
million. So, how is Loria going to make up that gap?</TE>
<TE>   By getting Washington.</TE>
<TE>   A far fairer method of bringing the Marlins to Washington would be
an auction. (Not that the Red Sox example gives much confidence in
the high bid actually winning.) The price could be $350 million. Out
of that windfall, Loria could be made whole, Angelos could be
indemnified and baseball would still have a huge chunk of change left
for the owners to divide among themselves.</TE>
<TE>   How will it actually work out? Loria is actively disliked by many
owners. He was too brazen in demolishing the Expos for the obvious
purpose of skipping town. There's even a school of thought that Loria
is the pigeon in this poker game. He thinks he's going to get
Washington. That's why he's going along with this double swap of
teams. But in the end game, he gets the shaft.</TE>
<TE>   If enough people scream bloody murder about him getting the
Washington market, then Bud will probably drop him like a hot potato.
So, who wants to yell first?</TE>
<TE>   The second Washington scenario falls into place if Selig's hopes
for contraction die. In that case, the Expos would move here. The
Montreal club -- run as a baseball chattel -- will be an incredible
embarrassment to the sport next season. Will we see a two-digit
attendance figure? Everybody knows the Expos have to be killed or
moved. If they can't be contracted, they would be sold at auction
after the 2002 season to the highest Washington bidder.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball, and especially Selig, hate this second possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Some in baseball suspect that Selig wants to contract the Twins,
at least in part because his Brewers are the closest team to
Minneapolis. He might pick up a lot of Minnesota cable TV subscribers
and increase his regional network. That could increase the value of
his franchise. Baseball, and Selig, can always claim the game would
be ''solidifying a franchise'' by increasing the Brewers' TV revenue.
But it just so happens to be Bud's franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Feel free to add one more item to the list of possible
conflict-of-interest issues that now confront Selig. This
no-contraction scenario is not what baseball wants. But if it is what
baseball gets, then Washington would be the better for it.</TE>
<TE>   What this area really needs for a successful franchise is local
ownership with deep pockets and deep roots. We've got that.</TE>
<TE>   The last thing Washington needs is another owner like Calvin
Griffith or Bob Short. And Loria fits that dubious description. He's
already mismanaged the Expos to the brink of insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   If, after that, he bought the Marlins, then moved them here, he
would be the ultimate baseball carpetbagger. Thanks, Bud, but no
thanks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all these Byzantine possibilities, one important change
has definitely occurred. Baseball and Selig are under constant fire
these days for their shady inbred dealmaking and their blatant
back-scratching cronyism. Suddenly, out of the blue, baseball has
started to see the light. What a coincidence. Who says pressure
tactics don't work?</TE>
<TE>   For 31 years, Washington has wanted baseball back. Now, a
commissioner has finally indicated that the game probably wants
Washington.</TE>

<HD>Getting a Closer Look Under the Hood in NASCAR</HD>
<DH>Motor sports: New Winston Cup director learns that politics
take place in the garage as well as outside of it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE SPENCER</AU>
<BD>THE SPORTING NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Change has arrived for the competitors in the Winston Cup garage, and
that's a good thing.</LD>
<LD>   For nearly two years, the teams were promised that a restructuring
would occur in the competition department. Last October, the official
word finally came from NASCAR President Mike Helton that John Darby
would replace Gary Nelson as Winston Cup director.</LD>
<LD>   After a decade of being the top car czar, Nelson now is running
the NASCAR research and development center in Conover, N.C., about an
hour northwest of Charlotte, and Darby is the point man for the
teams.</LD>
<TE>   Basically, Darby is in charge of implementing and enforcing the
rules in the Winston Cup garage, sort of like the supervisor of
officials in the NFL. He says that while his job description is
similar to the one he had in the Busch Series, the level of pressure
has jumped relative to the size of the playing field.</TE>
<TE>   "With Winston Cup being our diamond, the top of our pyramid, the
pressures are expected," Darby says. "But if the responsibilities and
the duties are under control -- and I'm not there yet but hope to be
very soon -- the extended pressures are just something you have to
deal with."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1984, Darby has worked his way up the NASCAR ladder, and he
honed his management skills as the Busch Series director the past
four years. But he still carries the same air of sensibility that he
developed early in his racing career as a technical inspector at
Rockford (Ill.) Speedway and while working on different racing teams.</TE>
<TE>   Though just 45, Darby seems wise beyond his years. His style with
the crews is almost paternal, strong yet fair. The competitors may
not always agree with him, but they at least find his decisions
consistent. In a short period of time, he has gained the respect of
many competitors in the Busch and Cup garages as an advocate for the
teams.</TE>
<TE>   "Working with John in the past and knowing how he structures
things, there are no surprises," says Buddy Barnes, research and
development manager for the No. 7 team. "He's personable and
understands all the angles: the racing side, the teams and the
business. You always feel like you've been heard when you go into the
NASCAR trailer. He may not give you the answer you were looking for,
but at least you know he'll be objective.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be under a watchful eye, and there will be times that get
touchy, but he can handle it."</TE>
<TE>   Last week at Daytona, Darby got a firsthand look at the increased
level of lobbying that occurs in the Winston Cup garage. The red
trailer could have used a revolving door for the number of top-level
manufacturers' representatives who already were politicking for
concessions. Darby insists that he will work to achieve parity among
the teams. That's one of the main objectives during Daytona testing.
He also is concerned about the speed and handling of the cars and
asked drivers for their opinions about how the new aerodynamic rules
package for restrictor plate tracks is working.</TE>
<TE>   Despite several rules adaptations, especially for the Daytona 500,
don't expect Darby to make changes throughout the year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 2002 is where we'll be looking at an all-time low number
of changes," Darby says. "There may be rewording of a rule or
restructuring to clear up the language. When I look at changes, I
look at how those changes will affect the teams and what they'll have
to do to fix their cars.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, at Daytona and Talladega there will be changes because we
switched the aero package, but in general, looking at the 2002
rulebook, the changes are very few."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the recent rules changes have involved safety. Darby has
been on both sides of the cat-and-mouse game that develops when
competitors try to get around rules, and he expects the crews to push
the envelope. But he will not waver and compromise the safety of the
drivers and the integrity of the cars' structure.</TE>
<TE>   "If there has ever been an awareness of safety, it's now," Darby
says. "It's always been one of our major concerns, but what's
happened is it's not just our No. 1 concern; it has spread throughout
the entire garage area. When there's time to gain a competitive edge
in today's world, the teams will say, 'Let's do what we can to go
faster,' but if there's any chance of putting the driver in a
precarious situation, then they'll back off a little.</TE>
<TE>   "My philosophies are very basic and common: If the rule says don't
stick your hand on the stove, then don't stick your hand on the
stove."</TE>
<TE>   Darby says that as he develops new Cup relationships, the teams
will learn three basic things: They can always talk to him, they can
trust him, and they can have confidence that he will make proper and
correct decisions. Darby says he'll "be tickled" if he can establish
that type of rapport by the end of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not looking for a pat on the back from (NASCAR chairman) Bill
France or Mike Helton," Darby says. "But if at the end of the year
the garage area doesn't feel like the season was too bad, that would
be all right with me."</TE>

<HD>Rams, Packers Are All About Quarterbacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB OATES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the calendar, Super Bowl day is still several weeks off, but it
may be that the real Super Bowl game will be played today when the
Green Bay Packers, with Brett Favre throwing, line up in St. Louis
against Ram passer Kurt Warner. In any case, look for the winning
team to last through the winter undefeated.</LD>
<LD>   These are the NFL players of the year--Warner one, Favre two--but
they're as different as two successful quarterbacks could be.</LD>
<LD>   Favre is a classic big-play man--like John Elway or Steve Young or
Terry Bradshaw--whose excellence or greatness is obvious. Anyone can
see and appreciate what Favre does.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast, Warner's excellence or greatness is disguised, hard
to see, unlike any other quarterback's, yet from this vantage point:</TE>
<TE>   No passer is quicker or more accurate than Warner.</TE>
<TE>   No passer is a better athlete or throws harder than Favre.</TE>
<TE>   And no one, perhaps, has seen such a matchup, factoring in the way
both teams run--with Ram Marshall Faulk and Packer Ahman Green--and
the way both teams defend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steelers Better</TE>
<TE>   The only other organizations with a Super Bowl potential this year
might be the Pittsburgh Steelers and defending champion Baltimore
Ravens, one of which, probably Baltimore, will be eliminated in the
game at Pittsburgh today.</TE>
<TE>   After an indifferent run through most of the regular season, the
Ravens, with the rebirth of running back Terry Allen, have perked up
lately, as they did a year ago, to cloud what seemed to be
Pittsburgh's sunny ride through the AFC.</TE>
<TE>   Plainly, the Ravens have become the mystery team of this
tournament. The Steelers, however, are a better blend of running,
passing and defense. Not as awesome on defense as the Ravens can be,
the Steelers have more offense if passer Kordell Stewart and runner
Jerome Bettis are set for the Raven defense.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kordell's Coach</TE>
<TE>   This is Stewart's seventh season in Pittsburgh, but his first with
his own personal coach, Tom Clements, the former Notre Dame
quarterback who, had he spent the last five years at Pittsburgh,
might well have had the Steelers in or near the Super Bowl all five
years.</TE>
<TE>   The stubbornness of Coach Bill Cowher in delaying the appointment
of Clement--or someone like him--is all that has held back Stewart,
whose ability, raw at first, has been obvious all along. All he
needed is a knowledgeable position coach to work on his confidence
and his profession's fine points, of which there are hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   Self-confidence is about half of quarterbacking; and the most
visible change in Stewart this season is the confident way he's
playing.</TE>
<TE>   That improvement comes from Clements, who by training is lawyer,
coach and athlete.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   49ers Run, Run</TE>
<TE>   The first round climaxed last Sunday with the day game, in which
Green Bay turned back the San Francisco 49ers in a 25-15 exercise
suggesting that San Francisco's coach, Steve Mariucci, misunderstands
the West Coast Offense.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, the 49ers wasted the first quarter and too much of
the game running into Gilbert Brown, Green Bay's 340-pound defensive
tackle.</TE>
<TE>   The Packers also wasted the first half running the ball, but a
home team can do that and get away with it, particularly on a cold
day at Lambeau Field.</TE>
<TE>   It's the visiting team that pays when it doesn't attack
aggressively with a passer--Jeff Garcia--who is about Favre's equal
except in experience, and with taller and stronger
receivers--6-foot-3 Terrell Owens, 6-4 J.J. Stokes, 6-2 Tai Streets
and the others. And so the 49er halftime lead was only 7-6.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco weakness is pass defense, which wouldn't have
mattered if Mariucci had played for a meaningful lead in the first
half but which mattered decisively in the second half when Favre
exploited it after Green Bay's high command awoke.</TE>
<TE>   The play that all but won for the Packers, setting up their 15-7
lead in the third quarter, was an underthrown second-and-11 51-yard
bomb, Favre to Corey Bradford, which most NFL right cornerbacks would
have intercepted but which San Francisco's, Jason Webster, misplayed.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers finally unleashed Garcia in the fourth quarter, when,
quickly, his passes achieved a 15-15 tie on a long drive and a
two-point conversion. But it was too late. By then, Favre, easily
piling up the last 10 points, was in a winning groove. And the 49er
pass defense wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Packers Deep</TE>
<TE>   When it was all over in Green Bay, it was clear that the Packers
could be a load in St. Louis today if they remember to start throwing
in the first quarter and keep at it.</TE>
<TE>   They have the quarterback for a shootout kind of game as well as
the receivers, Antonio Freeman and Bill Schroeder, and they add to
that lively depth with No. 3 and No. 4 receivers Bradford and Donald
Driver.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Packers have surrounded Favre with more talent than he
has had since his Super Bowl season, including tight end Bubba Franks
and running back Green, who isn't the Faulk type but can be nearly as
effective as Faulk on the draw plays that are essential to a passing
team.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the Packers won't let the Rams bound away.</TE>
<TE>   Although Favre doesn't run much anymore, he can still throw with
becoming accuracy when falling down in any direction--a trait that
sets him apart--and he can be expected to take more chances than
Warner likes to risk. The interception Favre threw last Sunday when
he should have hung onto the ball was worse than Garcia's. It just
didn't hurt as much.</TE>
<TE>   One area in which Warner exceeds Favre is connecting with
receivers in stride. In most games, this has given the Rams one of
their decisive advantages. This time if, for instance, a Warner pass
reaches Isaac Bruce or Az-Zahir Hakim in stride, or Torry Holt or
Ricky Proehl, the game's result might hinge on how fast the Green Bay
secondary recovers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami Inept</TE>
<TE>   The Miami Dolphins were the only home team that lost on wild-card
weekend, which probably says more about their inefficient pass
offense than their defense. Although the Ravens punctured that
defense on two monster drives of 90 and 99 yards to win, 20-3, the
Dolphins lost the day because, meantime, they couldn't throw the ball
well enough to keep up.</TE>
<TE>   Almost surely, their pass-offense weaknesses can be attributed
largely to lack of pass practice at training camp, through the
regular season, and, of course, last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Miami coach, Dave Wannstedt, is one of the many in the NFL who
consider that football is a game of running the ball and stopping the
run. That means, among other things, that on practice days, that's
what they practice. When in the Baltimore game it became necessary
for Miami passer Jay Fiedler to do his thing, he couldn't. Or,
alternatively, his receivers dropped the ball. As golfer Ben Hogan
said, there are only three ways to improve: practice, practice,
practice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rice's Night</TE>
<TE>   On the first day day of wild-card weekend, pro football's first
nighttime playoff game was a surprise success story last Saturday,
promising many more mid-January night NFL playoffs until at least the
year that a blizzard blows out the players. As the Oakland Raiders
won, 38-24, a very strange thing happened to the New York Jets. Every
time they threatened to rally during a wild five-touchdown fourth
quarter, a 39-year-old man put them down and away.</TE>
<TE>   That was wide receiver Jerry Rice, who carried nine passes for a
net 183 yards. At his age, Rice should have been home watching by the
fire instead of making the game's big plays, each of which showed
that he still has the quality that has separated him from his peers:
explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Never the fastest player on any field, Rice produces burst of
speed, on demand, as he did to set up the Raiders' third touchdown
after the Jets had finally scored their first. He was sprinting
across the field when quarterback Rich Gannon's pass caught him at
top speed. The net gain was 47 yards.</TE>
<TE>   To score the Raiders' fourth touchdown after the Jets had scored
their second, Rice sprinted into a corner as Gannon's pass arrived
from 21 yards away. That made it 31-17 and just too much for the
Jets, who only had one more touchdown in their quiver.</TE>
<TE>   On the game's decisive plays, it was the New York pass defense
that imploded.</TE>
<TE>   Unaccountably, considering Rice's big night, the Jets, on his last
big play, released him unmolested into the corner. Earlier, as the
Raiders took a 16-3 halftime lead when wide receiver Tim Brown scored
on Gannon's third-and-goal, three-yard pass, Brown was the only wide
receiver out. Unaccountably, the Jets didn't see him.</TE>
<TE>   On a chilly night in Oakland, their quarterback, Vinny Testaverde,
deserved better.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Big-Play McNabb</TE>
<TE>   The playoff season began with Saturday's day game at Philadelphia,
where Eagle quarterback Donovan McNabb was the difference as the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers fell out of the tournament, 31-9.</TE>
<TE>   Like Steve Young in the old days at San Francisco, McNabb is a
running back playing quarterback. Carrying the ball, he attacked the
Tampa defense with his usual speed, power and assortment of moves,
totaling 57 yards afoot to lead the more famous Tampa runners, Mike
Alstott, who finished with 32 yards, and Warrick Dunn, who had 29.</TE>
<TE>   Not the best pocket passer, McNabb has a big strong arm that
enables him to throw well on the run, giving the Eagle pass offense
the advantage it has had this season over most defenses.</TE>
<TE>   For McNabb, beating Tampa decisively was much harder than it might
have seemed, considering the final score. That's a great defense, and
it only buckled when McNabb authored three of the weekend's best
touchdown plays:</TE>
<TE>   * In the second quarter, taking a 10-3 lead, McNabb first faked a
pass, then scrambled right, turned, and shot a 16-yard scoring pass
through a very small hole to 6-6 tight end Chad Lewis in the end
zone.</TE>
<TE>   * Shortly before the half, on third and 13, McNabb disguised his
intentions for as long as he could before delivering the ball on a
fast-screen play to running back Duce Staley, who, behind
well-rehearsed blocking, weaved through the Buccaneers to score from
23 yards out.</TE>
<TE>   * That made it 17-3, and it was all but over when the Eagles
scored again in the third quarter on a 61-yard drive that began and
was sustained on McNabb's passes. Then, on second and six at the
Tampa 25, he handed the ball to rookie running back Correll
Buckhalter, who scurried up the middle to score while half of the
Buccaneers were playing pass defense and half were distracted by a
fake reverse. There wasn't a more effective play on offense anywhere
in what remained of wild-card weekend.</TE>
<TE>   It takes plays such as that to outmaneuver the Tampa defense, the
style of which has been Coach Tony Dungy's principal contribution to
the NFL game. Most teams, the Rams included, have copied Dungy's
tactics and strategy on defense.</TE>
<TE>   His problem remained the same: an inconsequential offense. The
Buccaneers are the proof that it's difficult to win pro championships
with defense.</TE>
<TE>   If Bill Parcells succeeds Dungy next season, he will need to do
hardly anything, except tinker a bit with the offense, to field a
Super Bowl-type team.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Buccaneer offense has ample talent. Dungy is leaving
everything in place at Tampa but a pass-offense mind-set.</TE>

<HD>Spurrier Attracts Attention</HD>
<DH>New Coach's Arrival Has Many Free  Agents Wondering if a
Move to  Washington Might End Up Being Fun</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MASKE</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Wide receiver Michael Westbrook said the coaching
change from Marty Schottenheimer to Steve Spurrier has dramatically
increased his interest in re-signing with the Washington Redskins
this off-season.</LD>
<LD>   Agent Leigh Steinberg said one of his quarterback clients, Jeff
George, would be interested in returning to the Redskins and hinted
that another, Troy Aikman, might be intrigued by the possibility of
coming out of retirement to play for Spurrier.</LD>
<LD>   "To be in an offense that Steve Spurrier has is always a
receiver's dream," said Westbrook, who's eligible for unrestricted
free agency.</LD>
<TE>   The Redskins must revamp their roster to give Spurrier the tools
his high-powered offense needs. Westbrook and rookie Rod Gardner rely
on bulk more than the speed Spurrier favors. And their only
quarterback is Sage Rosenfels, who didn't play as a rookie this
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins could attempt to trade for demoted New England
starter Drew Bledsoe or former New Orleans starter Jeff Blake.</TE>
<TE>   They could wait to see if the hefty contracts of Jacksonville's
Mark Brunell, Buffalo's Rob Johnson and Baltimore's Elvis Grbac lead
to their release. One NFL source said Wednesday that Brunell is
likely to leave the salary cap-strapped Jaguars.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins could sort through the unrestricted free-agent market
or attempt to obtain a former Florida quarterback, like Chicago Bears
reserves Shane Matthews and Danny Wuerffel. They could re-sign
incumbent starter Tony Banks or veteran backup Kent Graham, both
prospective free agents. They could select a quarterback in April's
college draft or they could consider a short-term fix like George or
Aikman.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve Spurrier's presence in Washington makes that a very
exciting opportunity," Steinberg said Wednesday. "Given his emphasis
on throwing the football and his innovative mind, all of a sudden
that may be a mecca for quarterbacks. That team is not that far away
from being a contender anyway, and he may bring some new wrinkles to
offensive NFL football. Any free-agent quarterback is going to be
interested, and it's not just the obvious guys."</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins ranked 28th in the NFL in total offense and 30th in
passing offense under Schottenheimer. Westbrook said late in the
season that he expected to be elsewhere next season. But as he
visited Redskins Park Wednesday, Westbrook said he would like to
remain.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the hiring of Spurrier increased the chances that he
will be back, Westbrook said: "Of course it does ... but it's still a
business, so we'll see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   Westbrook, who led the Redskins with 57 receptions for 664 yards,
said he hasn't spoken to Spurrier, but indicated he would have no
problem fitting into the new offense.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you've seen the ball thrown to me, I make plays,"
Westbrook said. "If he comes here and throws me the ball, I'm going
to make plays, period."</TE>
<TE>   If the Redskins try to sign a speedy wide receiver on the
unrestricted free agent market, their best bet might be the St. Louis
Rams' Az-Zahir Hakim. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Jacquez Green, who
played for Spurrier at Florida, also is eligible for unrestricted
free agency.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Green Wednesday, Spurrier said he might be interested
if he's available, but added that the team already has some good
young receivers.</TE>
<TE>   As for quarterbacks, Steinberg said George's problem was with
Schottenheimer and his short-passing offense, not the Redskins.
Schottenheimer released George two games into this season, and George
wasn't signed by another team.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever differences Jeff George had with the Washington Redskins
are gone," Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Aikman, 35, retired last offseason -- in part because of a string
of concussions, the last coming on a hit by Redskins linebacker LaVar
Arrington -- and spent the season as a broadcaster for Fox.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy had a wonderful time his rookie year commenting on Fox, and
he fundamentally plans to return" to his TV career, Steinberg said.
"Having said that, if an intriguing opportunity comes along, he'd
have to think about it."</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins almost certainly would have to trade up from the 18th
pick in the draft to get one of the top college quarterbacks, David
Carr of Fresno State or Joey Harrington of Oregon. The free-agent
market promises to be thin unless it's bolstered by salary cap cuts.
Jim Miller, Trent Dilfer and Gus Frerotte could be available, and Jay
Fielder can opt out of his contract with the Dolphins to become a
free agent. Charlie Batch, Cade McNown and Akili Smith also could be
released for salary cap reasons.</TE>

<HD>Schaap Helped Build a Better Sports Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE JACOBSON</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Dick Schaap began in this business at age 15, taking high
school scores for Jimmy Breslin at the Review Star, gone these many
years. Thursday a lot of people whose names you recognize paid
tribute in a memorial service at the magnificent Cathedral of St.
John the Divine in Manhattan. In between Dick made this a better
business.</LD>
<LD>   The sports business, the book business, the magazine business, the
television business, the newspaper business. And it took very fast
hands to beat him to a check.</LD>
<LD>   Billy Crystal was the master of ceremonies, if that's what you
call the person who presides over a memorial service. "I never got
laughs in a church before," Crystal said, and that was right. There
were some choked tears, more laughs and a lot more insight. "He
started at 15," Crystal said. ''He had to be either the youngest
sports reporter or the starting pitcher on the Bronx Little League
team."</LD>
<TE>   Schaap would have liked the line. It was funny and biting but not
too caustic, which was the way Schaap presented his work, which was
considerable over 40 years and more. It would stand well in a
journalism class.</TE>
<TE>   Martina Navratilova said she had failed to find a memorable line
of Schaap's to be quoted. "His strength," she said, "was not to be
quoted but to bring out the quotes of others."</TE>
<TE>   In a business of late marked by people who seek to make their name
by tearing down others, Schaap told what he found inside others. He
accomplished so much because his work was good, not because he was a
great self-promoter.</TE>
<TE>   His producer for years at ABC News, Joe Donnelly, said he'd point
out what everybody was talking about and Schaap would say, "that's
why I don't want to do it." His strength was in developing another
aspect and showing how it was at least as important and more
interesting. Dick and I took high school scores at the Long Island
Press, another departed paper, and even then he knew there was more
to it than the boxscore.</TE>
<TE>   Schaap died Dec. 21 at 67, three months after hip replacement
surgery that went wrong. Oddly, he was on the big video screen doing
his own afterword from a TV piece about his last book, "Flashing
Before My Eyes." There were clips of Ali, Vince Lombardi, Martin
Luther King, Son of Sam and more, who were subjects and often friends
of Schaap's.</TE>
<TE>   The book was generally panned as an exercise in name-dropping. His
best work wasn't writing about himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fitting that I drop a name," Crystal said in his droll
opening. "I'm a friend of Dick Schaap."</TE>
<TE>   And Dick's wife, Trish, said, "He was in awe of his life."</TE>
<TE>   He described his life as ''about athletes and actresses, cops and
comedians, politicians and playwrights, the eclectic mix that has
made almost every day of my life seem like a fantasy to me.</TE>
<TE>   "Often I am asked what my favorite sport is, and always I say,
'People.' I collect people.</TE>
<TE>   "I once asked Paul Prudhomme, the Cajun chef, his idea of great
taste, and he said, 'Chocolate ice cream with curry sauce, because
they're so different.' I feel exactly the same way -- about people."</TE>
<TE>   Crystal was a substitute teacher in Long Beach when Schaap, then
editor of Sport--another departed publication--tried to get Robert
Klein to MC the dinner for Sport's Man of the Year for 1974, which
was Ali.</TE>
<TE>   Klein's agent said, ''Take Billy.'' Schaap, in some haste, did.
And Crystal did impressions of Howard Cosell and Ali that he'd honed
in comedy clubs.</TE>
<TE>   His Cosell was wonderful and his Ali was popeyed and braying,
"I've got $900,000 in Chicago banks and eight Rolls-Royces--one for
every day of the week." They stayed good friends.</TE>
<TE>   I went to a nightclub with Schaap and saw Lenny Bruce, a brilliant
comedian, reading transcripts of his lingering trial for obscenity,
and failing to be funny. Bruce was staying at the YMCA, he said,
because it was the only room available.</TE>
<TE>   Schaap grew up in Freeport. Bruce grew up in Freeport. Schaap,
then a general columnist at the Herald Tribune -- another lost
newspaper -- defended Bruce. When Bruce died, Schaap wrote: "One last
four-letter word. Dead. Dead at 40. That's obscene."</TE>
<TE>   Breslin recalled that on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Kramer was there, too. With Schaap they produced "Instant
Replay," Kramer's diary of Green Bay's 1967 championship, portraits
of the Packers and Vince Lombardi and the game known as the Ice Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Schaap's title was going to paraphrase Lombardi, "The Day Time Ran
Out," but with 14 seconds left Kramer's block sprung Bart Starr for
the winning touchdown. Kramer gloried in the instant replays on TV,
and that became the title.</TE>
<TE>   The book became a classic for its insights into the game and its
people, with wit and without scandal or obscenity. It's a landmark
work 35 years later.</TE>
<TE>   Schaap's work was important because, as The Rev. Robert Wright
said, "Our play and our work have as real a place in our lives as our
prayer." On the way out, a jazz quartet played, "Memories of You."</TE>
<TE>   It swung.</TE>

<HD>Steeler Rookie Ready to Make Bigger Impact</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTIAN EWELL</AU>
<BD>THE BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>PITTSBURGH -- It's a bit odd that the NFL's top defensive rookie
rarely plays in passing situations, but it's something he intends to
change. Soon.</LD>
<LD>   "Next year," said Kendrell Bell, a linebacker who is a big part of
the difference between the way the Pittsburgh Steelers' defense
performed last year and the way it has stifled offenses during a 13-3
season.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the wrong time to be doing a lot of changes."</LD>
<TE>   For now, Bell, an Augusta, Ga., native, is perfectly happy to sit
on third-and-long situations, as pass coverage is his weakness.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers' coaching staff is equally satisfied at the moment to
have him lay vicious hits on running backs coming up the middle and
for him to rush the quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Taken 39 picks into the draft, he's done well in both assignments
this year--recording nine sacks, 15.5 tackles for lost yardage and 88
tackles overall.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers were good enough to earn him the top defensive
rookie honor earlier this week, as well as a Pro Bowl alternate
designation.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has made a bigger contribution to their team than he has
to ours," Pittsburgh Coach Bill Cowher said. "Certainly, his ability
to play at a high level for 16 games has been a credit to him and his
teammates."</TE>
<TE>   Bell is merely one of a stellar collection of linebackers on the
Steelers, which had the NFL's top-ranked defense this season.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Jason Gildon is headed to the Pro Bowl after a 12-sack
season. Joey Porter's nine sacks place him among the AFC leaders.
Earl Holmes had 118 tackles to lead the team for the third straight
season.</TE>
<TE>   But whereas before Pittsburgh had Gildon and Porter to rush
opposing quarterbacks from the outside, there wasn't a force in the
middle. Bell, who played at Georgia, solved that problem.</TE>
<TE>   "The presence Kendrell gives us makes us more of a well-rounded
defense as far as blitzes," Gildon said. "If you have a team with
guys both inside and outside, it keeps offenses off-balance and they
have to play you more honest."</TE>
<TE>   One way or another, the Steelers seemed to have solved the problem
of what to do when, last spring, they cut Levon Kirkland, a
once-starring linebacker who had slowed down.</TE>
<TE>   They moved Holmes into Kirkland's "Buck" spot -- the linebacker
who takes on more blockers, and, into Holmes' former freelancing,
"Mac" spot, they decided they would insert either free agent veteran
Mike Jones or Bell, who'd gone from junior college ball to Georgia
before entering the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   With Jones and Bell, Steelers defensive coordinator Tim Lewis said
he knew he was set at the position. Only later would he find out to
what extent that was true as the rookie quickly took to a 3-4 defense
that often allowed him to run free.</TE>
<TE>   Coming in as not even the first defensive player taken by the
Steelers in the draft (that was Texas defensive tackle Casey
Hampton), Bell set the tone by busting the team's star running back,
Jerome Bettis, during a training-camp practice.</TE>
<TE>   Opposing players got the same treatment throughout the season.</TE>
<TE>   "If you'd watch Kendrell in college, you would have figured out
after only a game or two that he fit the bill and fit it pretty
well," said Lewis, who feels Bell has the potential for a career on a
par with that of Ray Lewis, the Ravens' star linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   "But would I have guessed that he'd be a Pro Bowl alternate and
Defensive Rookie of the Year? Not in my wildest imagination."</TE>
<TE>   Bell's success has made him something of a celebrity in the Steel
City, where he now finds himself endorsing such products as
Blitzburgh Salsa, as well as doing the auto dealer commercials.</TE>
<TE>   He still has some unfinished business, however--like becoming a
polished football player. Cowher has tried to make sure Bell has not
had to pick up too much of the pro game too soon.</TE>
<TE>   By next season, Bell expects to have a broad grasp of his
responsibilities on defense. For now, he's happy with his role.</TE>
<TE>   "I know if I go out there and blow a coverage, it's a touchdown,"
he said. "I'm comfortable with where I'm at now. It's no problem with
me."</TE>

<HD>Charity Earley, 83; Led Black Women's Battalion in WWII</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charity Earley, the first black commissioned officer in the Women's
Army Auxiliary Corps and commander of the only battalion of black
women who served overseas during World War II, has died. She was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Earley , a retired teacher and school administrator, died of
undisclosed causes Jan. 13 in Dayton, Ohio, where she once served on
the Sinclair Community College board of trustees.</LD>
<LD>   In 1942, Earley became the first black commissioned officer in the
Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, which became the Women's Army Corps, or
WACs. She downplayed the distinction of being the first by saying it
was due to her maiden name, Adams, being at the head of the alphabet
and putting her at the top of the list of new officers. But as she
said in a 1997 interview, "I earned the rest of it, I assure you."</LD>
<TE>   As commanding officer of the 6888th Central Postal Directory
Battalion, Earley was the highest-ranking black woman serving
overseas. Her all-black, 850-member female battalion was stationed in
Birmingham, England, and later Rouen, France.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Earley was publicly recognized by President Clinton at
the groundbreaking for the Women's Memorial in Washington, D.C. A
year later, she was honored by the U.S. Postal Museum Hall of Fame.
And in 2000 she was among 16 veterans invited to Washington by
Clinton to attend the groundbreaking for a World War II memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "When I talk to students, they say, 'How did it feel to know you
were making history?' But you don't know you're making history when
it's happening," Earley once said. "I just wanted to do my job."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Kittrell, N.C., Earley graduated from Wilberforce
University and was teaching school when she received an application
for the newly established Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. in 1942.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the first time they started something new and positive
for blacks and whites at the same time," she told the Dayton Daily
News in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Earley was among 40 black and 400 white women in the corps' first
class, whose platoons were separated by race. At the end of officer
candidate training, Earley was made 3rd officer, the equivalent of a
2nd lieutenant, and became a commanding officer of a training unit.</TE>
<TE>   After being deployed to Europe, Earley set up and administered the
6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion.</TE>
<TE>   Her battalion's mission: to deliver mail to all Americans
stationed in the European theater.</TE>
<TE>   With soldiers constantly on the move, that was no easy task. There
were 7 million cards bearing the mailing information for individual
GIs on file in the European theater of operations--some 7,200 Robert
Smiths alone.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, when Earley's postal delivery battalion
arrived in England, the Battle of the Bulge had disrupted mail
deliveries to thousands of GIs, and three giant airplane hangars were
packed full of undelivered mail.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to learn the postal business real fast," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The women in her battalion spent the first two hours of each day
updating the cards bearing mailing information. Then they would sort
the new mail that came in.</TE>
<TE>   Earley had her women working in three eight-hour shifts: a third
would be sorting mail, a third sleeping and a third off duty.</TE>
<TE>   Before she was through, Earley told the Columbus Dispatch, she had
a brush with a court-martial.</TE>
<TE>   When a general showed up to inspect her postal unit, she turned
out only the off-duty third of her battalion for formal inspection in
order to let the others keep working or sleeping.</TE>
<TE>   The general, who was white, said he was going to send over a white
officer to show Earley how the job should be done.</TE>
<TE>   "Sir, over my dead body," replied Earley, who later remembered the
general sputtering and driving away in his car.</TE>
<TE>   Although the general brought charges against Earley, he quickly
dropped them and later apologized. Earley said they wound up becoming
friends.</TE>
<TE>   The camaraderie Earley and the women in her battalion developed
during the war extended to the annual reunions they held after the
war. As blacks and as women, they shared a special bond.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, we had segregation to put up with," she recalled.
"And the men didn't want the women in the Army; that was another
battle we had to fight. I know some of those women didn't love me,
but we stood together on things that mattered, such as doing a good
job."</TE>
<TE>   Earley left the service in 1946, retiring as a lieutenant colonel,
the highest-ranking black female officer in the WACs. She returned to
her teaching career and married a physician-in-training .</TE>
<TE>   Earley wrote a book about her experiences, "One Woman's Army: A
Black Officer Remembers the WAC," which was published in 1989 and
reissued in soft cover in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her husband, Dr. Stanley A. Earley Jr.; a son,
Stanley A. Earley III; a daughter, Judith Earley; two brothers,
Bishop John Adams and E. Avery Adams; and a sister, Dr. Lucy Rose
Adams.</TE>

<HD>Alex Hannum, 78; Took 2 NBA Teams to Titles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alex Hannum, a former USC men's basketball standout and the first to
coach two different National Basketball Assn. teams to championships,
has died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Hannum's death Friday at his home in San Diego was announced on
the Web site of the Philadelphia 76ers, one of the NBA teams he
coached, but no details were given.</LD>
<LD>   One of Wilt Chamberlain's favorite coaches, Hannum was inducted in
the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998, two years after he was selected
one of the NBA's 10 greatest coaches.</LD>
<TE>   He had a record of 471-412 in 12 seasons with four teams, and
coached four seasons in the old American Basketball Assn., compiling
a 178-152 record.</TE>
<TE>   Hannum first coached Chamberlain with the San Francisco Warriors,
who lost to the Boston Celtics in seven games in the 1964 NBA Finals.
Hannum was voted coach of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Chamberlain was traded to the 76ers during the 1964-65 season, and
Hannum joined him in Philadelphia for the 1966-67 season. The team
finished 68-13, an NBA season record that lasted until the Lakers
finished 69-13 in 1971-72.</TE>
<TE>   It was Hannum who convinced Chamberlain, then the NBA's greatest
offensive force, to share the ball more and pay more attention to
defense. The transformation helped the 76ers win the 1967
championship, ending the eight-season reign of the Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   Hannum coached the 76ers one more season before jumping to the
Oakland Oaks of the fledgling ABA. He guided the Oaks to a 60-18
record and the title in 1968-69, earning coach-of-the-year honors.</TE>
<TE>   He returned the following season to the NBA with the San Diego
Rockets, and coached the Denver Nuggets of the ABA from 1971 through
1974, his final three seasons as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Born July 19, 1923, in Los Angeles, Hannum was a 6-foot-7 center
during his playing days.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to USC after a stellar career at L.A.'s Hamilton High and
was with the Trojans for the 1942-43 seasons before spending more
than three years in military service. Hannum returned to USC for the
1946-47 season and became team captain and an All-Conference
selection in 1947-48, his senior season.</TE>
<TE>   Hannum had a nondescript nine-season playing career in the NBA,
but was named player-coach of the St. Louis Hawks in 1956-57 and led
the team to the finals. As their coach the next season, he guided the
Hawks to their only title, beating the Celtics in six games in the
finals.</TE>

<HD>Carl 'Bobo' Olson, 73; 1950s Boxer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carl "Bobo" Olson, middleweight champion of the world in the
mid-1950s, has died. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Olson, in his prime a relentless barrage puncher with a masterful
left, died Wednesday night in a Honolulu hospital after a long battle
with Alzheimer's disease.</LD>
<LD>   The only Hawaiian boxer elected to the International Boxing Hall
of Fame, Olson compiled a 99-16-2 record, with 49 knockouts, before
retiring in 1966.</LD>
<TE>   Olson, who got his nickname from his sister when he was a boy, was
born in 1928 and grew up on the tough streets of downtown Honolulu,
sharpening his boxing skills at an early age. He began fighting
professionally at 16, and won 19 fights before he turned 18 and could
legally box on the mainland. He won the vacant world middleweight
championship by outpointing Randy Turpin of England in October 1953
in a 15-round fight at New York's Madison Square Garden. That same
year he won the American middleweight title. The Ring magazine named
him Fighter of the Year. Olson successfully defended the title
against Kid Gavilan, Rocky Castellani and Pierre Langlois before
losing it in 1955 on a second-round knockout to Sugar Ray Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   In beating Olson, Robinson became the first fighter to twice win
back the world middleweight championship.</TE>
<TE>   Olson fought Robinson four times but never won. In their final
bout, in 1956 at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, Robinson knocked him
out in the fourth round.</TE>
<TE>   While he was middleweight champion, Olson challenged for the light
heavyweight title and was knocked out in the third round by Archie
Moore.</TE>
<TE>   After he left boxing, Olson worked as recreational director for
the Operating Engineers Local Union in San Francisco and in public
relations for the Teamsters before retiring.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Thomas Lebherz, 79, a UCLA professor of obstetrics and gynecology
who helped pioneer surgical treatment for the urinary incontinence
that some women suffer as a complication of giving birth, died of
cancer Thursday at UCLA Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to his work on treating incontinence, Lebherz
researched causes of premature births and the use of amniocentesis to
detect congenital problems in a fetus during the second trimester of
pregnancy.</LD>
<LD>   A renowned teacher often called "the resident's friend," Lebherz
was also an active obstetrician. He delivered more than 10,000 babies
during his long career, including 24 in one 24-hour period at the
Naval Hospital in Corona. After reading about the feat in 1954, the
late Groucho Marx invited Lebherz to appear on his TV show, "You Bet
Your Life."</LD>
<TE>   Educated at Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Md., and
Georgetown Medical School, Lebherz was a career Navy doctor until
tuberculosis forced his military retirement in 1968. During his
service, he was chief of obstetrics and gynecology at naval hospitals
in Bethesda, Md., Oakland and San Diego. He joined the UCLA faculty
in 1970.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Harry Lee Morrison, 69, a physicist and associate dean at UC Berkeley
who was known as a strong advocate for women and minorities in
mathematics, died Monday at his Berkeley home. The cause of death was
not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Morrison taught physics at Berkeley for 22 years until his
retirement from the faculty in 1994. He continued to serve as an
assistant dean in the undergraduate advising office of the College of
Letters and Science, a position he held for 11 years.</LD>
<LD>   As the only African American professor on the physics faculty, he
was a natural magnet for minority students in the department and
unofficially advised many of them. He helped develop the nationally
recognized MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement)
program, launched in 1970, to boost minority enrollment in college.
His specialty within theoretical physics was statistical mechanics.
He studied the behavior of fluids when the temperature drops low
enough for them to become so-called superfluids and wrote or co-wrote
many papers on the movement of particles in superfluid systems.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Arlington, Va., Morrison earned a bachelor's degree in
1955 and a doctorate in 1960 from Catholic University of America in
Washington. He taught physics at the Air Force Academy and worked at
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory before joining the UC
Berkeley faculty in 1972.</TE>

<HD>9/11 Strikes Chord With Guitar Maker</HD>
<DH>An Eastside man hopes stars will strum the instrument he
created with a patriotic theme to be auctioned off for the benefit of
attack victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Manuel Delgado gave blood. He donated money and prayed for the
victims of the terrorist attacks. But he still searched for a more
personal gesture to make.</LD>
<LD>   He decided to do what he does best: He made a guitar, one with the
Stars and Stripes on its front.</LD>
<LD>   But as he labored making the instrument by hand at his family's
guitar shop in East Los Angeles, he wanted it to serve a meaningful
purpose.</LD>
<TE>   The finished guitar, with its glittering mother-of-pearl stars,
now rests in a case in a corner of the shop, waiting to fulfill his
plans.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel, whose family's Candelas Guitars has crafted instruments by
hand on the Eastside since the 1940s, hopes to persuade various
big-time entertainers to play the guitar over the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on the anniversary of the attacks, he wants to auction off
the instrument in New York City and donate the proceeds to victims.</TE>
<TE>   It's an ambitious project, he knows. But, driven by faith, he
believes it will become a reality.</TE>
<TE>   "If this happens," he said, "it [will be] proof that it's not me
doing it, that God has his hand in this."</TE>
<TE>   Candelas Guitars is well-known in some circles of entertainers
and, over the decades, the shop has made instruments for some famous
musicians--particularly Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   The shop is now run by Manuel, 30, and his brother, Tomas, 32--the
third generation of guitar makers in their family.</TE>
<TE>   But the business can be traced to the 1920s when Manuel and Tomas'
grandfather, Porfirio, and great-uncle, Candelario, started it in
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1940s, they moved the shop to Los Angeles where Porfirio's
son, Candelario, who was Tomas and Manuel's father, became the second
generation of guitar makers.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Candelario died of cancer in 1994 at 52; Tomas and
Manuel have since operated the shop on Cesar Chavez Avenue, two doors
up from where it opened.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, the brothers were getting ready to come to work at
the shop when they awoke to the TV images of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath, they went through the same emotions that many
people across the country experienced.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel gathered with the congregation at his San Dimas church. As
the names of victims became known, each member of the church drew a
piece of paper and prayed for the name on it.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel's read: Christine Hanson, 3 years old, Groton, Mass. She
was on United Airlines Flight 175 from Boston to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I still pray for her," he says. He still carries the piece of
paper in his wallet.</TE>
<TE>   He prayed for personal guidance too.</TE>
<TE>   "God, what do I do? How can I help?" he remembers asking.</TE>
<TE>   Driving to work one morning, he realized he should use his
God-given talent of making guitars to help the victims.</TE>
<TE>   He ran the idea by Tomas, who, as the owner of the shop, gave him
permission to work on the special guitar.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next three months, they ran ideas for the design by each
other.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel printed out an American flag from the Internet to use as a
model. He decided to use mother-of-pearl to inlay "God Bless America"
and the stars.</TE>
<TE>   At first, he wanted to use woods only from America to show
patriotism. But then, as a symbol of world unity, he opted for the
woods from around the world that are typically used at the shop.</TE>
<TE>   There was Canadian spruce for the front, American maple for the
back, Indian rosewood for the binding, Honduran mahogany for the neck
and African ebony for the fingerboard.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to get others involved, so he explained his project to
representatives of some companies that make guitar parts. They liked
the idea and donated tuning pegs, a pickup, a case and the
mother-of-pearl.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the guitar is done, Manuel faces the hardest part of the
project: getting famous musicians to play it.</TE>
<TE>   He can call longtime friends of the shop, such as Los Lobos. The
band's drummer, Louie Perez, has been helping Manuel with the
project.</TE>
<TE>   But he doesn't exactly have the number for Garth Brooks, Manuel
jokes.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago, a well-known mainstream rock star came from Santa
Monica to the shop to pick up an instrument he had ordered.</TE>
<TE>   Over a bite across the street, Manuel tried to explain his project
and shyly asked the star if he would be interested in playing the
guitar during a performance. But the guitar hadn't been completed.</TE>
<TE>   The singer listened and didn't say no. But Manuel didn't want to
seem opportunistic so he didn't push it. He's hoping the singer
eventually will play it.</TE>
<TE>   A few doors have opened. He's to have a meeting with someone at
Universal Amphitheatre. A public relations agency has also agreed to
help pro bono.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to get all kinds of stars--Latin, mainstream American,
singers, musicians or other celebrities--to play one song during a
performance or to simply hold the guitar.</TE>
<TE>   Out of respect for the flag, he doesn't want the front of the
guitar to be signed . But signing the back would be OK.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he can take pictures of the stars playing the guitar and the
photos can be given to the person who finally buys the instrument.</TE>
<TE>   The guitar, with its full sound that fills a small room, is
typical of the guitars the shop often tailors for clients.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers would normally sell a steel-string guitar like it for
$3,000 and up. But Manuel says that, if he succeeds in getting stars
to play it, the sky is the limit.</TE>
<TE>   All the money would go to victims--maybe to some of those, Manuel
says, who have not gotten as much help as others.</TE>
<TE>   He believes the project will happen, Manuel says. But already, he
draws satisfaction from using his guitar-making talent wisely.</TE>
<TE>   "I really think I need to honor God in what he told me to do," he

<HD>Sampras Gathers No Moth in Win</HD>
<DH>Tennis: He survives insect invasion and Escude to advance
to fourth-round meeting with Safin at Australian Open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Moths were dive-bombing the court, disrupting Cyclops and setting off
the normally placid protagonist.</LD>
<LD>   What started as a high-quality match Saturday night was
threatening to turn into a science fiction movie in the early morning
hours today: "Mothra: Who Ate The Seeds?"</LD>
<LD>   Pete Sampras, with the help of his best weapon, his right arm,
escaped the moths, ordered the beeping Cyclops machine turned off and
survived the most dangerous foe of all, Nicolas Escude of France, at
the Australian Open. Carrying the movie motif a little further,
Escude is like the guy who keeps showing up in the next scene even
after he goes over a cliff in a burning car.</LD>
<TE>   Escude reached the semifinals here in 1998, and in three of his
matches, he lost the first two sets before coming back to win. Fans
in Melbourne know him as the man most responsible for winning the
Davis Cup for France against Australia in December.</TE>
<TE>   In this tournament, he saved two match points to beat Alex
Calatrava of Spain in the second round. He saved three more against
Sampras in the fourth-set tiebreaker today and forced a deciding
fifth set. For Sampras, the most painful match point was the first, a
double fault.</TE>
<TE>   The eighth-seeded Sampras needed four more match points--bringing
the total to seven--to finally put away No. 30 Escude, acing him down
the middle to win the third-round match, 7-6 (5), 5-7, 6-4, 7-6 (6),
6-3, in 3 hours 50 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   His reward: A fourth-round meeting against Marat Safin. Sampras
and Safin are the only players remaining on the men's side who own a
Grand Slam singles title.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras, who had 33 aces and 11 double faults, was relieved and
made fun of his edginess over line calls and the Cyclops machine,
which went off when moths landed on the service line. He even beat
his heart once with his fist, delighting his entourage, which, at
least temporarily, included an excited Sergio Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be the Mark Cuban of tennis," Sampras said,
jokingly. "There's going to be mistakes out there and you're going to
have distractions, and it's just a matter of keeping your composure."</TE>
<TE>   Said Escude: "I was thinking about the last round when I save the
match point. But I don't know if it's a miracle or something like
that, to win the fourth set."</TE>

<HD>Garofalo's Sorry Example</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Huntington Beach City Councilman Dave Garofalo is not the
first elected official to violate the law and his public trust. And
it would be hopelessly naive to believe that he will be the last.</LD>
<LD>   But it's important for county residents, not just those in
Huntington Beach, not to paint all elected officials with the same
shameful brush.</LD>
<LD>   Garofalo, after about 18 months of investigations and denials, has
pleaded guilty to one felony and 15 misdemeanors. They stem from his
actions in approving issues before the council involving advertisers
in publications he owned and violating state financial reporting
laws. He resigned from the council last month saying he wanted to
give more attention to "personal issues and get on with my life."</LD>
<TE>   Court records suggest there may have been numerous other cases
than those involved in his guilty pleas. His votes over a two-year
period, according to the district attorney, were "flagrant, repeated
and consistent."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being placed on probation, fined nearly $50,000 and
required to do 200 hours of community service, the convictions bar
Garofalo from holding public office again, unless a judge clears his
record.</TE>
<TE>   Some officeholders have expressed fears that the public will now
hold them in lower regard because of Garofalo's greed and sorry
example. That's understandable.</TE>
<TE>   It's also understandable that some residents would harbor such
feelings of distrust because through the years they have seen other
Orange County politicians who thought they could get away with
wheeling and dealing finally get caught.</TE>
<TE>   Cases like Garofalo's do make it more difficult to maintain the
public's confidence in its government, and also to sustain the belief
that elected officials, except for the rare exception, are honest.
But they are. It's important to remember that and not let Garofalo's
ethical and criminal shortcomings leave the impression that such
actions are widespread or the norm.</TE>
<TE>   But elected officials countywide can't entirely ignore what
happened in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The question is not whether Garofalo learned his lesson. More
important is whether others in office, who are there to serve the
public rather than their own financial interests, have learned
anything. They need to be aware of the limits set out in
conflict-of-interest laws and scrupulously live by them.</TE>
<TE>   Garofalo's convictions should have no lasting harm if they are not
allowed to poison the public's confidence in its representatives and
institutions. If that happens, Garofalo would have taken much more
from the community than the profits he gleaned from his illegal
votes.</TE>

<HD>A Change in Interpretation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some school districts in the county take the shortsighted approach
when it comes to involving its non-English-speaking parents in school
board sessions and giving them a voice in educational issues.</LD>
<LD>   The rationale goes something like this: We don't get a lot of
Spanish-speaking parents at our school board meetings; no one is
clamoring for an interpreter, and to have one would be an added
expense. So, we won't have an interpreter unless there is a greater
demand. To be sure, not having an interpreter does save money. But at
what price to effective communication? Should parents struggling with
the English language not be able to express the same concerns and ask
questions about their children's education as English-speaking
parents?</LD>
<LD>   Orange County's ethnic makeup is changing, as the federal census
so graphically showed. Various ethnic groups now make up 49% of the
county population--and in 10 cities within the county, they are now
the majority.</LD>
<TE>   Latino residents are the largest minority group in the county. And
the Asian population is the fastest-growing. In some schools, Latino
and Asian students make up 90% or more of the total enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   It's time more school districts recognized the changes and changed
too.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana has. Several years ago, it began providing a Spanish
interpreter at school board meetings. An interpreter is also
available for other school meetings and for Vietnamese and Cambodian
parents. The district's paper goes into students' homes in three
languages.</TE>
<TE>   And at its last school board meeting, the Newport-Mesa Unified
School District began providing an interpreter for its
Spanish-speaking audience.</TE>
<TE>   What they have realized is that the lack of many Latino and Asian
parents at board meetings is not because of a lack of interest. It's
because of the lack of an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents struggling with English may feel embarrassed about
addressing the board and find it difficult to have a real dialogue
when language is a barrier on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   With an interpreter, they can fully understand what board members
are saying and can better express their opinions.</TE>
<TE>   That will increase not only understanding and communication but
attendance as well.</TE>
<TE>   More districts ought to take a look at the number of
English-deficient students they have and reconsider their reluctance
to provide an interpreter for parents eager to get involved in their
children's education--if they could get around the language barrier.</TE>

<HD>Reclaiming North County</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County is certainly "new" by the standard of many other
American communities, where housing, business and parks have
histories going back generations. But even as the county contemplates
new communities in Rancho Mission Viejo and parts of northern Irvine,
it is reclaiming older neighborhoods and commercial districts in
North County. The revitalization of older neighborhoods and the
recycling of parcels that have fallen out of use is a difficult but
worthy challenge. To put a fresh face on our older communities, it
ought to be encouraged and facilitated by local government.</LD>
<LD>   When Richard Nixon opened his presidential library in his native
Yorba Linda, he recalled a place that was rural and forsaken, in
contrast with the world capitals he frequented in adult life. Yorba
Linda today is no longer remote agricultural country but has become
one in a string of suburbs along Imperial Highway and just off the
Riverside Freeway. Its Old Town, the downtown area, has often been
unfamiliar even to residents, who bypass it to go elsewhere to shop
and dine.</LD>
<TE>   The city has been buying property and will work with a developer
to build housing, including some for seniors, along School Street.
There are plans to convert back alleys to narrow streets to
facilitate access to stores. In general, planners want to restore the
area's historic ambience, giving people, as one commissioner put it,
"a reason to stop."</TE>
<TE>   The aesthetic appeal of downtowns has become a priority in this
age of cookie-cutter strip malls and subdivisions. The public
response has been favorable, and the sentiment is worth nourishing.
To reclaim some of the feeling of the city's history, there are such
touches planned as putting wood siding instead of stucco on the
exterior of the retail center, in a way that brings to mind old
packinghouses.</TE>
<TE>   Not all are thrilled with the plan, especially those small
businesses that would be relocated. The city needs to go the extra
mile to help affected business owners find new quarters in town.</TE>
<TE>   Revitalization is spreading to unincorporated areas, which don't
have the focus of a single city's action. Here creative thinking by
residents can go a long way in working with county government and
drawing attention to spots for potential new housing.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the West Anaheim Neighborhood Development Council
identified a rundown strip mall near Anaheim and proposed
transforming it into a site for homes that young families could
afford.</TE>
<TE>   County officials, pressured by the state to do more for low-income
rental and owner-occupied housing, has been looking for such places.
The time is ripe for citizens and government to work together.</TE>
<TE>   The efforts by both cities and the county to target older
neighborhoods for improvement is important for the future of the
northern part of the county, where much of the commercial and housing
stock is older. With good planning, new housing and revitalized
shopping areas in older neighborhoods can complement each other and
be attractive to low-income workers.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange, an old industrial property off the Costa Mesa Freeway
has been identified for a public park. A 15-acre plot that used to be
owned by a railroad and that was used as a landfill, asphalt factory
and surface mine now has the unlikely future as a park.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated it and two
other parcels in the county for a demonstration project on recycling
industrial property.</TE>
<TE>   In a city such as Orange, which has a low percentage of parkland,
this is a great opportunity, provided that the land can be cleaned up
as intended.</TE>
<TE>   All these efforts signal a willingness to consider new uses for
old sites. In so doing, a partnership of government at every level
with local residents can brighten aging parts of the county.</TE>

<LD>Re "Probation for Frisky; Care Bill for Owner," Jan. 5: Responsible
people do not let domestic cats--or any animals, for that
matter--wander outside in any environment, particularly one in which
where there is an active coyote presence. The euthanasia or
quarantine of Frisky is a moot point because the cat probably will be
killed by a car, dog, exposure to fertilizer or poison, coyote, or
one of the many other outdoor hazards. Also, it's rude to allow any
pets to wander onto neighbors' properties where they defecate,
urinate and create other nuisances.</LD>

<LD>Re "Has the Fox Had Its Last Act?," Jan. 7: The Fox Theatre was an
important part of my childhood. It was there that I saw "Shane,"
"Ivanhoe" and many other movies as a young girl. The movies were
wondrous, but so were the murals, the red velvet curtains and the
gilt ornamentation of the theater. I often tell others about the Fox
Theatre, sharing memories of its grandeur and its effect on me. Going
to a movie there was like entering a magical place. There are few
movie theaters like it today.</LD>
<LD>   The city must act to save this theater. Plummer Auditorium has its
own purpose, but it does not have the grandeur of the old Fox
Theater.</LD>

<HD>DMV Should Review Its Call in Vanity Plate Case</HD>

<LD>Re "Ex-Fullback Flagged for Vanity Plates," Jan. 4: I read in utter
amazement that the Department of Motor Vehicles demanded the recall
of a vanity plate because a Native American activist, Eugene Herrod,
complained after surfing the DMV Web site looking for "offensive"
plates. When I read the plate, 1REDSKN, my immediate thought was of
the football team, not a racial slur.</LD>
<LD>   What's next? Does the DMV impound my Jeep Grand Cherokee? How
about the Mazda Navajos or Chevrolet Cheyennes? Maybe Herrod can
write the president and have the Apache, Blackhawk and Comanche
helicopters grounded and the Tomahawk missiles dismantled.</LD>

<TE>   The offense in this "vanity license plate" case is in the
thin-skinned vanity of activist and complainer Eugene Herrod and the
DMV. Apparently Herrod has nothing better to do than surf the
Internet in search of a problem that isn't a problem. The DMV would
better serve its customers by managing their long lines.</TE>
<TE>   What would happen if members of the Audubon Society suddenly took
offense and whined about the use of Cardinals, Eagles, Ravens,
Falcons and Seahawks? And what about the "Chiefs"?</TE>

<TE>   I can identify with Dale Atkeson's dilemma. In the 1980s, I
requested to use "HAYBROD" on my plates. I chose it in honor of my
grandchildren, Hayley and Broderick. The DMV guys said, in essence,
"Sorry, it might be construed as Hey, Broad." Go figure.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Outcry Over Pets in Pet Food," Jan. 6: While the practice in St.
Louis of boiling down euthanized pets is certainly horrific, it is by
no means unique. Most shelters in Orange County, including the county
shelter, and veterinarians send their euthanized pets to a rendering
plant right here in Orange County. I have no doubt that the final
destination for these much loved pets is the food bowl of Fido or
Kitty.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers should be as vigilant about reading pet food labels as
they are about their own food labels. Beware of any label that says
"byproducts," which means anything from hoofs, beaks or the beloved
golden retriever you euthanized because of old age.</LD>
<LD>   The only humane way to handle euthanized pets is to have them
cremated. Large shelters, such as Orange County's, should have their
own crematory.</LD>
<TE>   Many veterinarians offer crematory services for a fee, and your
pet's ashes can be returned to you in a nice urn or box. This is the
only way to have peace of mind and ensure the humane treatment of
your pet's remains.</TE>

<HD>Debating the Future of El Morro Mobile Homes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A Solution for Crystal Cove," Commentary, Jan. 6: Assemblyman
John Campbell (R-Irvine) said the state parks department should
extend the lease for renters at the El Morro Village Mobile Home Park
for 10 more years, double the rent and dedicate the money to
improvements for the historic district of Crystal Cove State Park.</LD>
<LD>   This proposal does not address a solution for the greater good of
all Californians. The demand for camping spots, especially along the
coast, far outstrips the supply. The State Park System has about
11,000 campsites statewide, yet the demand is more than double that
number and the department has not added any campsites in Southern
California since 1992.</LD>
<LD>   The state has been trying to develop the El Morro park since 1982,
when the general plan for the park was approved. However, extensions
won by the renters have kept them living in a state park for 20
years. If they are granted a 10-year extension beyond December 2004,
they will have lived on public park property for more than 30 years.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, we have a park plan that is fully approved and funded
from Proposition 12 park bond money and ready to go at El Morro. We
have already spent $800,000 in the planning process. We will be ready
to begin construction in early 2005 to build a 60-unit campsite and
rehabilitate the environment and habitat areas of creek.</TE>
<TE>   The parks department is looking at all funding possibilities, such
as special legislation, private donations, the Proposition 40 park
bond measure on the March ballot, the Coastal Conservancy, and the
money set aside by the Coastal Commission in 1982, now more than $2.8
million dollars. There is a public demand for both El Morro and
Crystal Cove, and we do not want to sacrifice one for the other.</TE>
<TE>   How long should the public wait to watch the sunset from an El
Morro campsite? The renters have enjoyed a wonderful life in a state
park. But after 20 years, it is time for the greater good for all
Californians to prevail. It is not time to push this denial of public
park property to 30 years or more.</TE>

<TE>   Campbell reminded me that governing sometimes requires tough
choices. His recommendation isn't tough, though; it's just smart. Who
cares if El Morro Village continues on in its tiny portion of Crystal
Cove State Park if we are able to get the cottages repaired? Unless
the campers are willing to pay a sum equal to the rental income at El
Morro Village, let's get the leases extended and get on with
business.</TE>

<TE>   Who does John Campbell speak for? Hardly the Crystal Cove Historic
District! He was completely silent during three years of contentious
debate on the luxury hotel contract, the district's future use and
the tenants' pleas to stay. He even failed to vote for the park bond
measure recently passed by the Legislature with funding that could be
tapped for Crystal Cove.</TE>
<TE>   More than 25 years after its purchase, this unique coastal site, a
direct link between the beach and inland canyons of the park, finally
will be made available to the public to enjoy. Beach access and
parking, picnicking and 60 view campsites will add to existing state
park facilities that are full all summer.</TE>
<TE>   Respectfully, Assemblyman Campbell, with plans and funding in
place, the campground should proceed for the benefit of all your
constituents. Let's get the state parks department out of the yearly
rental business by supporting the park bond measure, Proposition 40,
on the March primary ballot. It's time for El Morro tenants to thank
the landlord (us) for 25 years in this very special place and move
on.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Many meetings and letters to our state representatives, governor,
the state park system and a lost litigation later, we finally have
Campbell with a logical and fiscally responsible plan to extend
leases at El Morro for 10 years to fund the restoration of the
historic cottages at Crystal Cove. Thanks for his perseverance and
for understanding finance. Maybe someday Crystal Cove Historic
District will be restored to its former quaintness and be back on the
California Tourist Guide as a "must see," and I'll be able to find
something there worthy of a painting again.</TE>

<HD>Why CDC Report on Suburban Living Is Junk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Report Deals a Blow to Suburbs," Jan. 7: I used the adjective
"junk" in a very specific context when discussing with your reporter
the Centers for Disease Control's report on the supposed negative
health effects of sprawl. The report theorizes that suburban living
increases respiratory disease (because of poorer air quality) and
heart disease and obesity (because of a lack of exercise
opportunities). The authors work at an institution that provides
access to volumes of data on respiratory disease, heart disease and
obesity. All they had to do to create a convincing, scientifically
sound argument was analyze this data and compare what it says about
suburban versus urban living, yet there were no such comparisons in
the study.</LD>
<LD>   The complete lack of comparative health data leaves only two
possible conclusions: The study is junk because the authors did no
work to substantiate their thesis, or they saw the data, realized it
undercut their argument and chose not to present it. In that case,
junk is too kind a description.</LD>
<TE>   Smog alerts in Southern California are down 75% since 1970,
despite a tripling of our population--much of it going to the
suburbs--during the same period. Crime rates and traffic congestion
are both higher in urban areas, which would tend to discourage
exercise in non-sprawl neighborhoods. Most new neighborhoods, on the
other hand, offer parks, sidewalks and trails that encourage
exercise. Reality, therefore, runs counter to the opinions stated in
the CDC report, making the report's lack of data all the more
unfortunate.</TE>
<TE>   The authors are correct in their belief that planners have a
responsibility to consider human health in their community designs.
Planners also have a responsibility to plan a community people will
want to live in. In Southern California, we are addressing both,
which is why in new planned communities one sees design being used to
make towns more car-friendly, because people want to drive, and more
health-friendly, because residents want to be able to walk, bike and
run with safety in their neighborhoods.</TE>

<LD>Re "O.C Judge Faces Additional Molestation Charge," Jan. 1: What is
perplexing is that if convicted of the additional child molestation
charge, this trusted public servant would be subject to a maximum
state prison term of only 14 years? How is it that a nonviolent,
albeit recidivist offender, who pilfers vitamins and videotapes to
support a drug habit, can receive life in prison while a sexual
predator who would use a position of trust to prey upon our youth
receives any kind of release date at all?</LD>
<LD>   Consider that this elected jurist has been dealing out hard time
to criminal defendants for more than 25 years. Perhaps the time has
finally come to take a thorough look at our states' sentencing
guidelines and implement a change that would both repair the
disproportionate sentences that are handed out, and simultaneously
get our judicial priorities in order. If convicted, we should start
with Judge Ronald C. Kline.</LD>

<LD>I've been following the tirades by district attorney candidate Wally
Wade, and all I can say is, does this guy have anything positive to
say? Wade does nothing but spew negative attacks on the district
attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe I'm in the dark, but I like the job Tony Rackauckas has
done. Wade is clearly still smarting from the beating he took from
Rackauckas in 1998. All I know is that since Rackauckas took office,
gangs and gang crime have fallen dramatically. Deadbeat parents have
been made to pay up. DNA tracking of sex offenders is in place.
Streets are safer for our kids.</LD>
<LD>   It's no wonder Wade would rather focus on office politics than on
Rackauckas' crime-fighting record.</LD>

<TE>   I've been reading about the race for district attorney with a lot
of interest. As someone who works in the private sector, I know the
challenge of managing people and resources. But what strikes me as
utterly unbelievable about the district attorney's office is that the
incumbent actually has to put up with people like Wallace Wade.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas' job of managing hundreds of lawyers can't be easy. But
doing so when they're making all sorts of flagrant, and unproven,
allegations must be impossible.</TE>

training of Rackauckas' prosecutors is "unnecessary," as he claims,
then how does he explain these five tragedies? What change is
Rackauckas making to ensure the innocent are not convicted?</TE>
<TE>   If we are to learn from the past, as Wade suggests, then the
obvious change is to change the district attorney. The March election
just isn't soon enough.</TE>

<LD>Re "Tenants Responsible for Living Conditions," Letters, Jan. 5:</LD>
<LD>   Let us not forget that a judge weighing all the evidence convicted
Sam Menlo of a misdemeanor criminal offense of being a slum landlord
in Anaheim. Menlo's actions were so abhorrent that he was sentenced
to live in his complex for many months instead of going to jail.</LD>
<LD>   It costs money for a landlord to keep up apartments. I know,
because I own and manage two buildings. If the bad conditions are
caused by the tenant, a landlord should get rid of them or at least
charge them for damage. If he has vacant apartments and drug needles
are found, he needs to get security guards and alert the police.</LD>
<TE>   Menlo apparently did not take action because he wanted the rent
money more than repairs. He took the money and donated part of it to
his church and to high-profile charities such as his La Brea Avenue
building. This does not exculpate him.</TE>

<LD>Re "Allaway Was Agitated by Movie, Nurse Testifies," Dec. 11:</LD>
<LD>   Did I really read that a nurse claimed that Edward Charles Allaway
became "angry and unglued" when he watched "Night of the Living Dead"
in 1999? Who is picking the movies for mass murderers who plead
insanity?</LD>
<LD>   I think I'm a relatively sane guy, but "Night of the Living Dead"
freaked me out. What must have Allaway thought? Shouldn't any movie
involving murder and/or eating people be banned from mental
hospitals? Do we need a government committee to study this? Maybe a
new entertainment director at mental hospitals?</LD>

<TE>   Maybe I missed your readership's reaction to the story that
Allaway became "angry and unglued" while watching "Night of the
Living Dead" in 1999 while an inmate at Patton State Hospital for the
Criminally Insane. "Night of the Living Dead"? Who is the
entertainment coordinator? What did they serve for dinner that night,
Silence of the Lamb Stew? The inmates are running the asylum.</TE>
<TE>   David Powers</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It really galls me to see Allaway on TV crying tears of self-pity.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't he realize how lucky he is? There are people on death row
who have killed only one person.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he is enjoying a standard of living much better than he
could earn as a janitor.</TE>
<TE>   We should eliminate the verdict of "not guilty by reason of
insanity." Instead, let's say "guilty, but insane," followed by a
sentence appropriate to the crime, but suspended. When or if the
perpetrator recovered from insanity he could then serve his time in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   This would give some closure to the relatives of the victims
instead of dragging them through the ordeal, year after year, of
facing the possibility of seeing a murderer walk free.</TE>

<HD>More to Airport Motives Than Meets the Eye</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Letters from Newport Beach-area residents and the other El Toro
airport supporters dutifully regurgitate statistics that seem to
support this need.</LD>
<LD>   But the truth is they just want a new airport somewhere else,
anywhere else, so they can transfer their problems. And the facts
themselves rebut any real argument for an airport at El Toro that
they can conjure up. John Wayne is operating at only 58% of capacity.
The existing runway can be lengthened within existing airport
boundaries at a fraction of the cost of building El Toro.</LD>
<LD>   The differences in the vision for the former Marine base at El
Toro couldn't be any more distinct. If you're not sure about all this
or believe even any of the county's quieter, cleaner, airport
rhetoric, just look at the areas surrounding any 30-million passenger
airport in the nation. Look at the communities under its flight paths
and the impact it has on these areas. That is the vision that Newport
Beach, the 3-2 Board of Supervisors majority, and the Airport Working
Group has for most of central and southern Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   Is that really what we want for our communities, ourselves and our
children? Is that why we all moved here?</TE>
<TE>   Douglas K. Blaul</TE>

<TE>   Are the South County residents who oppose a nearby convenient
airport the same ones who crawl inch by inch through the El Toro Y
day in day out for work and then again to get to John Wayne Airport?
And aren't the leaders of these cities the same ones who approve one
new huge residential complex after another in the hopes of increasing
city revenue? How are all these people going to fly anywhere? You'll
need a helicopter just to get to the airport.</TE>

<TE>   Re "A Fair Look at the Great Park," Editorial, Dec. 9:</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial tried to make controversies surrounding the park
issue more clear. The most significant fact is that the park plan
advertised in the glossy brochures is not the park plan promises for
the March ballot. It does not include any new building projects.</TE>
<TE>   Also important is that voters need to consider the potential
revenue losses to the county if the El Toro property becomes a park
instead of an airport. Reports on the subject conclude about 80,000
jobs and $6 billion in annual economic activity would be sacrificed.
Now that we are in a recession, that lost becomes even more
significant.</TE>
<TE>   Esther Fine</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The recent article on the report of toxic contaminants at El Toro
left out several significant facts:</TE>
<TE>   * The study was funded by the Newport Beach-based Airport Working
Group--the same outfit whose "study" said the park would cost
taxpayers $2 billion. The county's own estimate placed this at $19
million over 20 years; less than half of what has been spent on an
unworkable plan for an airport to date, or 33 cents per resident per
year.</TE>
<TE>   * The county's own EIR states that there are "significant impacts"
from the construction and operation of an airport resulting in
increased cancer deaths that cannot be mitigated.</TE>
<TE>   * It is the responsibility of the federal government to clean up
any toxins left behind at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, please beware of "information" funded by the deep
pockets of the Newport NIMBYs!</TE>

<HD>A Hole in the Runoff Dam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID S. BECKMAN and ROBERT CAUSTIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Local water agencies are making decisions that will chart Southern
California's course in addressing its No. 1 water pollution
problem--polluted urban runoff--for most of the rest of the decade.
The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board on Dec. 13
approved a strong new federal Clean Water Act permit to control
polluted runoff.</LD>
<LD>   Now all eyes are on Orange County. On Friday, after delaying its
vote for more than a month, the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality
Control Board approved a new runoff permit for the northern half of
the county. Later this month, the San Diego Regional Water Quality
Control Board will vote on a plan to cover southern Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The unusual convergence of all of these permitting actions during
December and January makes this an important moment for a region
grappling with how to reduce billions of gallons of polluted runoff,
most of which is discharged to the ocean without any treatment.</LD>
<TE>   These regulatory decisions determine how frequently beaches will
be closed to swimmers and whether runoff will be allowed to be
acutely toxic to marine life, as studies show it often is today. And
they play a central role in supporting, or undermining, recreational
and tourist economies interconnected with the beach lifestyle for
which Southern California is world famous. Economists tell us that
tourism related to our beaches contributes billions of dollars a year
to the local economy--a good-enough reason alone to step up efforts
to protect water quality.</TE>
<TE>   The Clean Water Act permits at issue contain requirements that
must be implemented by cities to reduce toxic runoff for a five-year
period expiring in early 2007. The permits are best thought of as
"blueprints" for pollution reduction. They contain a set of programs
ranging from educational efforts targeting the public to technical
specifications for new pollution-reducing features in large
development projects.</TE>
<TE>   As a consequence, the stringency--or weakness--of the terms of
each permit can and will mean the difference between success and
failure in keeping beaches open and waters safe for people and marine
life.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the proposed new permits are a mixed lot. The good news
is that the Los Angeles board, with jurisdiction over Ventura and Los
Angeles counties, approved a strong plan that is a significant
improvement in many respects over its 1996 effort, one that
environmentalists and some board staff consider a near-total failure.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the San Diego board has proposed a set of actions for
southern Orange County that is considerably better-calibrated to
improve water quality than previous plans. (The San Diego board has
jurisdiction over South County because of watershed boundaries.)</TE>
<TE>   The South County plan is focused on assuring that new development
does not diminish water quality and on assuring that some troubling
beach conditions get appropriate attention. This plan is based on
meticulous preparation by regional board staff members and could make
a real difference in protecting ocean beaches and other local waters.</TE>
<TE>   With a strong plan in place in Los Angeles, and a strong one set
for adoption for South County, the Achilles' heel along the coast is
North County. The Santa Ana board approved a plan Friday that has
been heavily influenced by foot-dragging bureaucrats and their allies
in the development community. This plan is weaker than either the Los
Angeles permit or the plan for South County.</TE>
<TE>   Astoundingly, the Santa Ana board rejected or limited common-sense
practices that are routine elsewhere in Southern California,
including in Los Angeles and San Diego. In an attempt to deflect
criticism, the Santa Ana board claimed that its plan was simply "less
prescriptive" than other local plans. But in this case at least,
"less prescriptive" is doublespeak for "less effective."</TE>
<TE>   All Southern Californians have a stake in assuring that the set of
solutions adopted to address our foremost water pollution problem
does not resemble a slice of Swiss cheese. Because of urban runoff's
diffuse nature and broad influence, efforts in the coastal plain to
control pollution can be swamped by inaction inland. Similarly,
strong efforts in one part of the county can be undone by weak
efforts in another area.</TE>
<TE>   For these reasons, Santa Ana regulators need to view their runoff
plan as a down payment on a set of new and stronger actions. These
officials, many of whom are new to the board, need to ask themselves
if they are doing enough for their local communities. More important,
however, given the scope and implications of the polluted runoff
problem, the broader Southern California community needs to ask these
officials to plug the holes that threaten not only the coastal
environment, but ultimately the environmental economies on which the
whole region depends.</TE>

<LD>Proponents of Measure M contended that Orange County roads and
freeways would be improved if the voters approved the half-cent sales
tax increase. They were right. Measure M tax revenues have markedly
enhanced the Orange County road system, especially along the Santa
Ana Freeway from the Los Angeles County line south past the aptly
named Orange Crush.</LD>
<LD>   Many Orange County commuters can attest to the improvements
wrought since Measure M passed in 1990. Even if rush-hour traffic can
slow to a crawl around the Orange Crush, it would be much worse
without the Measure M-financed improvements.</LD>
<LD>   Proponents of the toll road system contended that the toll roads
would reduce traffic on the freeways and other arterial roads in
Orange County. They were right. The toll roads are, increasingly,
siphoning traffic away from more congested routes. Perhaps equally
important, the toll road system in Orange County is largely financed
by private investors, allowing the limited public road funds to be
leveraged into better roads and freeways in other parts of the
county.</LD>
<TE>   Two major improvements in the Orange County transportation
infrastructure, two major successes. Critics of the toll roads and
the Measure M-financed freeway improvements might want to drive up
the San Diego Freeway some weekday afternoon and contemplate the rear
bumper of the car in front of them as they inch along ever so slowly
from the South Bay curve to the San Fernando Valley. Opponents of
more freeways in west L.A. were "successful," and now that area is
frequently gridlocked. Orange County is in better shape, but not
without looming transportation problems.</TE>
<TE>   Like almost everything else in Orange County, these looming
transportation problems are made more acute by the fact that Orange
County gets less money from the state, $13 per capita for road
building and maintenance, than most other California counties.
Sacramento County, by way of comparison, gets $26 per capita, or
twice as much.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the Orange County legislative delegation in Sacramento
might as well be representing San Francisco. Baghdad by the Bay gets
$51 per capita for road building and maintenance. Many Orange County
cities, including Anaheim, Costa Mesa and Tustin, get less than $20
per capita. Combined city and county state road fund revenues for
much of Orange County are in the $33-per-capita range, a fat
$18-per-capita less than San Francisco gets.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, however, Orange County is not alone. Remarkably, Los
Angeles County only gets $13 per capita from the state. Riverside
County and San Bernardino County do a little better, at $17 per
capita each. Is it possible that the Orange County delegation,
especially the Democrats who are part of the political majority in
Sacramento, can work with their colleagues, particularly Los Angeles
County legislators, to get more state money for the Southland?</TE>
<TE>   Now the Orange County Transportation Authority contends that a
glorified trolley line in central Orange County is a good use of the
limited transportation funds available. They are wrong. Metro areas
throughout the U.S. have wasted billions on similar systems. "Light
rail" costs way too much, provides very limited service and, even
worse, diverts scarce taxpayer dollars from much more effective
solutions. By any measure, expanding bus service helps more people
(especially those who really need public transportation), costs less,
reduces traffic congestion more effectively and is flexible to boot.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, like a toddler digging around in Mom's purse, the
OCTA just can't let go of building "something." Mothers know the
substitution trick well. If a toddler gets into Mom's purse, a quick
switch to a favorite toy can divert the child's attention.</TE>
<TE>   Improved bus service probably won't divert OCTA's attention, but a
high-speed monorail from John Wayne to Ontario Airport just might.
Consider the manifold benefits of such a monorail. No airport at El
Toro, coupled with a permanent reduction in commercial flights from
John Wayne, would be popular throughout the county and do much to
heal the nasty north-south split. Reduced auto traffic from the
Inland Empire could help shorten trip times for all Orange County
drivers, especially if the monorail stopped at Anaheim Stadium (with
shuttle buses to the Disneyland resort area). Inland Empire commuters
to Orange County would benefit from less traffic on the Riverside
Freeway. Traffic on the San Diego Freeway would be reduced, which
would help Orange County, and perhaps more importantly, Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, such a monorail would cost more than CenterLine. But
the monorail would actually have passengers, which would make it more
cost-effective.</TE>
<TE>   Also, because the monorail could benefit Los Angeles County,
Riverside County, San Bernardino County and Orange County, it is
possible that a critical mass of state legislative support could
coalesce around changing appropriations to get a greater share of
state transportation funds for Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The contractors pushing CenterLine would certainly prefer the more
extensive monorail project. A few of OCTA's urban planning ideologues
might be disappointed. Maybe there is a solution. Give the OCTA board
members a lifetime pass, and let them ride free to their hearts'
content.</TE>

<LD>For a decided change, USC's basketball team, not UCLA's, was
Arizona's targeted team last week in Tucson.</LD>
<LD>   "Wildcat coaches played a psychological game in which their weekly
buildup was exclusively USC," Greg Hansen wrote in the Arizona Daily
Star.</LD>
<LD>   "This was the first time in 15 seasons that the Trojans came to
Tucson more feared than UCLA. Or at least co-feared, and the young
Arizona team bought it all."</LD>
<TE>   The Wildcats routed the Trojans, 97-80, after leading by as many
as 31 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which team holds the NBA record for points scored in
the first half of a game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That settles it: On HBO's "Inside the NFL," sideline cameras
during the 49er-Packer playoff game captured 49er Coach Steve
Mariucci's discussion with officials over a play involving punt
returner Vinny Sutherland that was under review.</TE>
<TE>   "They say that he touched it?" Mariucci asks. "Ask the guy. Look,
he says he didn't touch it. You are wasting everybody's time. Why
would he lie? He's from Purdue."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Heady stuff: Jeff Gordon in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: "[We]
expect a few thousand Green Bay Packer fans to work their way into
the Dome on Sunday for the big playoff game [against the Rams], and
we're pleased to see they will be allowed to wear their cheese heads
after those ludicrous hats clear security. But what can St. Louisians
wear to counter them? Toasted ravioli heads?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Good investment: Steve Rosenbloom in the Chicago Tribune: "If
David Stern takes all the money he gets from fining Dallas owner Mark
Cuban for ripping NBA officials and puts that money toward training
the refs better, then this whole thing would go away."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Field conspiracy: Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel: "You were
astonished at Steve Spurrier's sudden announcement he was leaving
Florida and then again when he chose Washington as his new home.</TE>
<TE>   "Didn't make sense, did it? But that's because you were not aware
of the mysterious 'FedEx factor.' Spurrier's' last game was in the
FedEx Orange bowl. The Redskins play their home games at FedEx
Field."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Get it? Making note of Michael Jordan's impending divorce, Jay
Leno quipped: "Apparently now, for the last six, seven years, Michael
Jordan has had like a half-dozen girlfriends while he's married, and
I'm thinking to myself, 'Well, good God, forget the NBA, this guy's
presidential material.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal rule: From Caught on the Fly in the Sporting News: "Yep,
Casey Jacobsen's scoring is up, but his sharpshooter rep is starting
to dull. The extra--ahem--attention has him f-f-f-frustrated, and
he's shooting with one eye on the rim, the other on the NBA. Jake
says: 'If scouts believe I can't create my own shot, well,
one-on-one, that's not a problem. One-on-two or -three, that's a
problem.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Phoenix, with 107, against Denver on Nov. 10, 1990.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jim Armstrong in the Denver Post: "Raider defensive
tackle Darrell Russell has been suspended for a year after testing
positive for Ecstasy. In a related story, the Detroit Lions' entire
team recently tested positive for Agony."</TE>

<HD>Lakers Not Shaken or Spurred</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Even without O'Neal in the middle, San
Antonio's big men stifled in L.A.'s 98-81 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>On a decidedly football Saturday in Texas, when the most stubborn NBA
fan had more invested in the basketball game in Chicago than the one
here, and NBC barely glanced over at them, the Lakers did what they
can do.</LD>
<LD>   Once more without Shaquille O'Neal, who served the last game of
his three-game suspension, the Lakers rode their system into San
Antonio, stuck pretty closely to Tim Duncan, watched David Robinson's
career wither a little more, and beat the Spurs, 98-81, at the
Alamodome.</LD>
<LD>   The Western Conference behemoths, accounting for the last three
NBA titles, played for the first time since last spring, when the
Lakers swept the best-of-seven conference finals by an average of
22.3 points.</LD>
<TE>   "Certain things we do against this team just work," Laker forward
Rick Fox said. "And it's up to them to figure out something
different. Until they do, we're going to keep doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant scored 28 points, but this was not about Bryant
dragging along the Shaq-less Lakers behind him. The Laker bench
scored 39 points, beginning with Slava Medvedenko's 12 in 14 minutes,
and the Lakers ran a six-point lead to eight with Bryant on the bench
for the first six minutes of the fourth quarter. Bryant returned and
immediately made two critical shots--a three-point basket from the
top and a five-foot floater--that pretty much finished the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Robert Horry did the hard work on Duncan, who
scored two points in the fourth quarter and four points--on
two-of-eight shooting--in the second half. Robinson, guarded mainly
by Mark Madsen, scored four points in 23 minutes, so the Spurs' size
advantage was lost in an interior of Madsen, Horry and Samaki Walker.</TE>
<TE>   "As Dave gets older," Fox said, "the twin-tower threat isn't that
much of a threat."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it is barely more than a curiosity. Robinson did not play
in the fourth quarter, the continuation of a recent trend in which
Malik Rose has gotten those critical minutes. The Spurs signed the
36-year-old Robinson for $20 million over two seasons last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "We need better performances out of some people," Spur Coach Gregg
Popovich said. "Whether Shaq is playing or not is irrelevant. You
have to play for 48 minutes. A couple of people didn't show up, but
that's not as important as the team only competing for two periods."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the best shooting team in the league, the Spurs missed 14
of 15 three-point attempts, shot 41.5% overall, and then were
outrebounded by four. Robinson was one for eight from the field and
Steve Smith was three for 10, statistics that would appear to round
up the "didn't-show-up" suspects.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of an odd eight days in which they lost to the Chicago
Bulls and the Miami Heat, both last-place teams, the Lakers scored 29
fourth-quarter points and finished with two wins in three games
without O'Neal. In the first win, the 39-point victory against
Memphis, Bryant scored 56 and everyone else held on.</TE>
<TE>   This was different.</TE>
<TE>   This was Derek Fisher with 11 points and five first-half rebounds.
This was Madsen, straining for five rebounds and keeping the
basketball alive countless other times. This was Fox bouncing into
the back court on the skin of his knees and elbows, maintaining a
possession that ended with an alley-oop, Fisher to Bryant. This was
Mitch Richmond, gaining momentum with his shot, making three of four
field goals in 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   And, as the San Antonio crowd rose in the fourth quarter, when the
game would be decided by one final push by someone, the Lakers took
out on an 11-point run, to a 94-77 lead, finally on Madsen's
left-handed, seven-foot hook over Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the Lakers were in the building, they left halfway
to the sweep that put them into the NBA Finals against the
Philadelphia 76ers. In that Game 2, Phil Jackson was ejected. He
stayed around in this one, but seemed only mildly impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a fortunate day in a lot of ways," he said. "A lot of
bounces went our way."</TE>
<TE>   And so the Lakers have won five in a row against the Spurs in a
series once dominated by San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   The only man who could know the difference, or be reasonably sure
of it, stood near his Laker teammates and smiled and shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "This team expects to win, they've been here," said Samaki Walker,
the former Spur. "I guarantee you, there was a different aura before
the game in these two locker rooms. I guarantee you."</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>You might see Wizards 77, Bulls 69 and Eagles 33, Bears 19 and think
Chicago was a two-time loser Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Uh-uh.</LD>
<LD>   This was a special day for the city, a day when it was the center
of the sports world.</LD>
<TE>   It was a chance to savor and remember some of the privileges of
being a Chicago sports fan over the years. Like the opportunity to
drive west on Madison Avenue and watch Michael Jordan. Or the chance
to watch the NFL playoffs in familiar Soldier Field, that chilly but
intimate lakefront stadium with the majestic columns.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Chicago got to honor Jordan, something it never tires
of doing. And it took the great play of Donovan McNabb to knock the
Bears out of the playoffs. That's Donovan McNabb from Mount Carmel
High on the South Side of Chicago, my friend.</TE>
<TE>   See, the city couldn't lose.</TE>
<TE>   It got to show off the lung power of 23,534 fans at the United
Center and 66,944 fans sitting in sub-freezing temperatures at
Soldier Field (which will be renovated, with a new seating bowl and
more luxury suites that will obscure the view of the columns from
inside the stadium).</TE>
<TE>   Great city, great fans. As Jordan's agent, David Falk, said, "Any
fans that could support the Cubs through 50 years have to be great."</TE>
<TE>   Want to know the power of the Chicago fans? They tamed Jordan.
They turned the greatest competitor the NBA has seen into a pussycat.</TE>
<TE>   They showered him with affection, used their lungs and hands to
repay him for the six championships he won for them and the 29,277
points he scored for them and the countless Michael Moments he gave
them.</TE>
<TE>   And those eyes that used to burn with competitive fire were moist
with ready-to-roll tears.</TE>
<TE>   Players, coaches, media and fans were all fair game for Jordan's
self-motivational tactics.</TE>
<TE>   You think it's a coincidence that he had some of his greatest
moments--including his career-high 69-point game--in Cleveland? It's
because the Cavaliers' fans never treated him with the usual
reverence he found at other arenas. They rooted vehemently against
him without paying him a scintilla of respect. Never even paused to
appreciate the show. So he took particular delight in punishing them.</TE>
<TE>   But he couldn't bring himself to hate Chicago on Saturday. The
city always showed him love.</TE>
<TE>   Wizard Coach Doug Collins recalled the days when he coached a
younger Jordan with the Bulls and the fans would make the old Chicago
Stadium's foundation shake when MJ took the court.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember, 'And from North Carolina ...' and not being able to
hear anything else," Collins said. "The Stadium used to sway. You
could feel it move. I coached him every night for three years and the
hair stood on my forearms every time he was introduced."</TE>
<TE>   This time he was the last visitor introduced, and with far less
fanfare.</TE>
<TE>   "A 6-6 forward from North Carolina, Michael Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   But the crowd kept cheering and it wouldn't die down. The wave of
noise crested, gathered itself, then surged again.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan waved. His eyes looked watery. He smiled.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after more than a minute, they turned off the lights and
began the Bulls' introductions. Traditionally, especially in the
glory years, that was the cue for Bull fans to go crazy. This time
they booed. They weren't ready to stop applauding Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   The ovation lasted long enough and reached decibels high enough to
create a special moment. And there might have been problems if it
were allowed to continue.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God they cut the lights out, or we'd be sitting there
still, I'm sure," Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan still couldn't believe the outpouring of emotion.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost had me crying. How am I supposed to play after that?"</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't. Not to his old standards, of course, but not even up
to par with the better efforts of his latest comeback. He scored only
16 points and missed 14 of his 21 shots, even threw up a couple of
airballs. He committed nine turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "When the crowd started that whole thing, it was tough for me to
play," he said. "I had a tough time playing against Chicago, because
... it's like playing against a relative. It's not as intensified,
it's not quite as motivated."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help that he had to go against the in-your-face defense
of Ron Artest. That's the same guy who broke Jordan's ribs during a
pickup game last summer. You'd think Jordan would want revenge
against him, but he likes this kid too much.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Ron Artest," Jordan said. "He's got so much intensity and
such a competitive drive. One time he kicked me and said, 'I'm
sorry.'"</TE>
<TE>   Artest certainly didn't show Jordan any reverence when he was
guarding him. He didn't even appreciate the Jordan-induced delay in
the Bulls' introductions.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't like that," Artest said. "After they called him, they
should call us right out. It's not like somebody won the championship
and they're giving out rings and trophies. They called him, call us
out. What are we waiting for? We're the home team."</TE>
<TE>   The less said about the game itself, the better. To paraphrase the
inscription on the Jordan statue outside the arena, this game was the
worst there ever was, the worst there ever will be.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls flirted with the NBA record for worst field-goal
percentage in a game (22.9%) before making five shots in a row near
the end to finish at 24.7% And still the Wizards won by only eight.
They made 24 field goals to the Bulls' 22 and shot 36.9%. They
committed 22 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Given those ugly numbers, you couldn't blame Bull owner Jerry
Reinsdorf or General Manager Jerry Krause for having missed the game.
And although it did make for another subplot in the never-ending saga
of Jordan's departure and who's responsible, Jordan didn't choose
this day to add to the argument.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they had something else to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With 2:45 remaining in the game, it was clear the Bulls' fans had
better things to do--like go someplace to watch the Bear game.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Jordan, his divorce received much bigger play in
the supermarket tabloids than his return to Chicago received in the
local sports pages this week. The anticipation of the Bears'
divisional playoff against the Eagles captured the city's attention.
Even at the United Center on Saturday, the loudest cheers after
Jordan was introduced came when the video screen showed a fan holding
up a Bear helmet. With 3:43 left in the fourth quarter, fans started
chanting, "Let's Go Bears!"</TE>
<TE>   By the time Jordan finished addressing the media and the cab
dropped me off at Soldier Field, it was the second quarter of the
Bear-Eagle game. At times it appeared the Bears could continue their
wacky, winning ways. Thanks to a 47-yard run on a reverse and a
39-yard interception return, the Bears had a 14-13 lead in the third
quarter even though they were being dominated statistically and in
time of possession.</TE>
<TE>   But McNabb proved to be too good. He recognized defenses, spotted
blitzes and mismatches and forced mistakes. He used his fleet feet
primarily to escape trouble in the pocket and took off running only
when necessary.</TE>
<TE>   He drubbed the Bears for 262 yards passing and two touchdowns and
ran for 37 more yards plus a TD. After he ran five yards for the
Eagles' final touchdown with 3:21 to play, he dunked the ball over
the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   That's one more dunk than Jordan had on the day.</TE>
<TE>   But, as McNabb noted, he was wearing Air Jordan shoes.</TE>

<HD>Patriots Give It a Rave Review</HD>
<DH>AFC: Raiders snowed under in overtime, 16-13, after
controversial call leads to tying field goal in regulation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Nobody would have given the New England Patriots a snowball's chance
in August to play for the AFC championship this season.</LD>
<LD>   Their chances seemed just as slim with less than two minutes left
in regulation Saturday, when the Raiders started to celebrate after
linebacker Greg Biekert pounced on the ball in four inches of snow,
recovering New England quarterback Tom Brady's apparent fumble with
Oakland leading by three.</LD>
<LD>   Leave it to instant replay and a New England kicker from South
Dakota State to turn the Raiders' Super Bowl hopes into slush with a
16-13 overtime loss.</LD>
<TE>   After Brady's fumble was reversed--officials ruled his arm was
moving forward in a throwing motion, making it an incomplete
pass--the Patriots kept their drive alive and Adam Vinatieri kicked a
45-yard field goal with 27 seconds left to force overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Vinatieri was a hero again in sudden death, this time with a chip
shot, a 23-yarder that beat the Raiders on the first possession of
overtime and sent the Patriots to the AFC title game against the
winner of today's Pittsburgh-Baltimore game.</TE>
<TE>   It was a crushing blow for the Raiders, who led by 10 points in
the fourth quarter--and never trailed until the moment they lost.</TE>
<TE>   In silver-and-black lore, it will go down as one more item for the
conspiracy theorists.</TE>
<TE>   "People try to say what goes on between the league and Al Davis
doesn't affect what goes on on the field," receiver Tim Brown said,
discussing the call.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played two teams in a row that didn't have any penalties.
[Actually, New England had one and Oakland had four.] I watched them
jump offsides not two but three times before they kicked the field
goal. We let it come down to the officials, and in this game you
can't do that."</TE>
<TE>   On a day when the snow began falling several hours before the game
and continued throughout, lying four inches deep except where snow
blowers cleared the yard lines during stoppages, no one would have
expected kickers to thrive.</TE>
<TE>   But the Raiders' Sebastian Janikowski kicked field goals of 38 and
45 yards, and Vinatieri kicked the game-tying and game-winning field
goals.</TE>
<TE>   In a moment that brought to mind the "Snowplow Game" of 1982
against Miami, Vinatieri and holder Ken Walter spent the timeout
called by Oakland before his game-winning kick clearing an area of
the snow--but only with the aid of their cleats.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure that quote-unquote icing the kicker works,"
Vinatieri said. "In a game like this, having a little extra time to
clear the field is not a bad thing."</TE>
<TE>   His kick sent the crowd of 60,020--amazingly there were only 272
no-shows--into delirious celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Raider Coach Jon Gruden, who wore a sun visor whose brim became
laden with snow, disagreed with the reversal on the fumble, but not
vociferously.</TE>
<TE>   "It was obvious I thought it was a fumble, but the officials
thought otherwise," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Walt Coleman told a pool reporter why he reversed his call
after the replay was signaled from upstairs, the rule in the final
two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, what I saw on the field, I thought the ball came out
before his arm was going forward so that's why I ruled a fumble.</TE>
<TE>   "Then when I got over to the replay monitor and looked at it, it
was obvious that his arm was coming forward. He was trying to tuck
the ball and they just knocked it out of his hand. His hand was
coming forward, which makes it an incomplete pass."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman said Brady would have had to either get the ball all the
way down or lose it before his arm started moving forward for it to
be a fumble.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Woodson, the Raider who hit Brady, was firm.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clearly a fumble," he said. "They got a second chance, and
they made the most of it."</TE>
<TE>   For New England fans with long memories, it was payback for the
1976 playoff game against the Raiders when referee Ben Dreith made a
questionable roughing-the-passer call against New England that led to
Oakland's winning score.</TE>
<TE>   This time, credit went to Brady for two fine drives, and a
resurgent second half.</TE>
<TE>   Six for 13 for 74 yards in the first half, he and the Patriots
abandoned their cautious running attack in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Brady directed a drive for a field goal on the opening possession
of the third quarter, going to the air.</TE>
<TE>   He finished 32 for 52 for 312 yards with one interception.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders' Rich Gannon was 17 for 31 for 159 yards, throwing a
touchdown pass to James Jett in the first half on a drive that began
at the 50 because of a punt coverage penalty against the Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, the Patriots went repeatedly to David Patten,
who finished with 107 yards in eight catches.</TE>
<TE>   Brady scored on a six-yard keeper to cut the lead to 13-10 with
7:52 left in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   As time ran down after Brady's fumble was reversed, the Patriots
still faced second and 10 from the Oakland 42 with 1:47 left.</TE>
<TE>   Brady hit Patten for 13 yards, and after two incompletions,
carried the ball one yard to the 28, setting up Vinatieri's tying
kick.</TE>
<TE>   In overtime, the Patriots got the first possession--perhaps the
most crucial play other than the final kick.</TE>
<TE>   They converted two third downs--and then a fourth and four from
the 28, passing on the 45-yard field goal and gambling they could get
closer.</TE>
<TE>   They did, and Vinatieri came through.</TE>
<TE>   "Awesome," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not for the Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll get over it," Gruden said. "It will be tough. We'll get
over it and just have to move on."</TE>

<TE>   NFL Rule 3, Section 21, Article 2, which officials used to change
the call on Tom Brady's apparent fourth-quarter fumble to an
incomplete pass.</TE>
<TE>   * Note 2: When a Team A player is holding the ball to pass it
forward, any intentional forward movement of his arm starts a forward
pass, even if the player loses possession of the ball as he is
attempting to tuck it back toward his body. Also, if the player has
tucked the ball into his body and then loses possession, it is a
fumble.</TE>

<DH>NFC: McNabb, Eagles break hearts all over Chicago with
33-19 win that puts them in the conference title game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>With his legs, Donovan McNabb broke the heart of Chicago. With his
arm, McNabb collapsed the big shoulders of the big city.</LD>
<LD>   It was not, after all, the return of Michael Jordan that crushed
the spirit of this sports-crazy place, but the homecoming of Chicago
native McNabb, the Philadelphia Eagle quarterback who neutralized
Brian Urlacher, pulverized Ted Washington, Keith Traylor and all of
the other big, bruising Chicago Bear defenders.</LD>
<LD>   It was McNabb, a fan of the Bears for most of his life, who set
the tone from the beginning until the end of Philadelphia's 33-19
smashing of the Bears Saturday in an NFC divisional playoff game at
Soldier Field.</LD>
<TE>   The Eagles (13-5) will play the winner of today's game between St.
Louis and Green Bay for the NFC championship next Sunday. The Bears
(13-4) will stagger into the off-season stunned by the brilliance of
McNabb and bruised by the courage and tenacity of an underappreciated
Eagle defense.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, playing here for the first time as something other than a
Chicago Bull, was relatively ordinary at the United Center, even if
his Washington Wizards did win.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb was positively extraordinary. He threw for two touchdowns
and ran for a third. He escaped defenders and high-stepped out of
sure sacks.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb, who once played a high school championship game at Soldier
Field, completed 26 of 40 passes for 262 yards. He also ran for 37
yards. He made Urlacher, an all-pro and maybe the best defender in
the league, first frustrated, then spitting mad and, finally,
respectful of McNabb.</TE>
<TE>   "He's better than advertised," Urlacher said. "What you see on
film doesn't do him justice. Donovan is tough and smart and he played
a great, great game. Give him a lot of credit."</TE>
<TE>   The Bears, winners of the NFC Central, hadn't been to the playoffs
since 1994. Their home field, filled with history, will be shut down
for a year's worth of renovations and a general updating. The last
game played on this old, hard field will be filled with memories the
Bears will want bulldozed away.</TE>
<TE>   On their first possession, the Eagles got a 34-yard field goal
from David Akers. The big play was a 14-yard pass from McNabb to
receiver James Thrash. After the Bears went three and out, the Eagles
got another Akers field goal, 23 yards this time. The big play in the
drive, maybe in the game, was a 43-yard pass from McNabb to Thrash,
taking the Eagles from their 33 to Chicago's 24.</TE>
<TE>   Twice McNabb seemed tackled before he released the pass. Chicago
arms grabbed his legs, his shoulders, tugged at his feet. McNabb
escaped. His legs are strong enough to outmuscle a defender's Bear
hug, his shoulders sturdy enough to shake it off.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what [McNabb] does," Bear Coach Dick Jauron said. "He
moves around in the pocket and finds guys that are not initially
open. He can buy time with his legs and his athletic ability."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Eagles were dominating, the Bears took a 7-6 lead
when reserve wide receiver Ahmad Merritt scored his first NFL
touchdown on a 47-yard run, taking a handoff from backup quarterback
Shane Matthews and streaking up the left sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Matthews was playing because, just over two minutes into the
second quarter, starter Jim Miller threw an interception to
Philadelphia's Damon Moore. During Moore's 18-yard runback, defensive
end Hugh Douglas smashed into Miller, who suffered a separated
shoulder and never returned.</TE>
<TE>   And that was not the only big injury a Bear starter suffered. Wide
receiver Marty Booker also separated a shoulder and safety Mike Brown
suffered a concussion when he delivered a hit to UCLA alumnus Freddie
Mitchell on a punt return.</TE>
<TE>   After Chicago's first score, McNabb took the Eagles on an 11-play,
69-yard touchdown drive. He threw the scoring pass, 13 yards to Cecil
Martin, with 14 seconds left in the first half. McNabb had to
scramble, duck, dance and move forward, backward and sideways to
escape Chicago defenders while waiting for a receiver to get open.</TE>
<TE>   "Donovan is fun to watch," Eagle Coach Andy Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   That 13-7 lead disappeared too. The Bears reclaimed the lead,
again without benefit of a long drive. This time it was an
interception by cornerback Jerry Azumah. R.J. McQuarters dived and
tipped the pass. Azumah caught it, juggled it, caught it again and
ran 39 yards for the score. That 14-13 advantage would be Chicago's
last.</TE>
<TE>   After the Eagles had gone ahead, 20-14, the Bears drew within
three with a 38-yard field goal by Paul Edinger. But Akers kicked two
more field goals, his third and fourth of the game, to put the Eagles
ahead, 26-17.</TE>
<TE>   From there, it was all McNabb. His throwing and running kept the
ball from the Bears. He ran five yards for the final touchdown with
3:21 to play, and when the final seconds ticked away, he threw up his
arms and shouted.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always loved this place, loved it to death," he said. "What
a great place to win a big game."</TE>

<HD>UCLA's Loss Gets XX Rating</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Bruins squander a 20-point lead in the
final 13 minutes and Arizona storms to 96-86 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>They know all about heat in this desert town. From the sun. From the
chili peppers that dry in the sun.</LD>
<LD>   So the fact that UCLA shooters were jalapeno hot in the first half
Saturday didn't cause Arizona to produce even a bead of sweat.</LD>
<LD>   The Wildcats merely countered with habanero heat, overcoming a
20-point deficit in the last 13 minutes to win going away, 96-86, in
front of a McKale Center sellout crowd of 14,571 that squirmed
through the first half and screamed through the second.</LD>
<TE>   It was an especially painful loss for No. 9 UCLA (13-4, 5-2 in
Pacific 10 Conference play), which has not beaten Arizona (13-4, 6-2)
at McKale Center since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The current group of seniors helplessly watched their best chance
of leaving with a victory dissolve in an astonishing Wildcat surge
that obscured a return to form by UCLA's Jason Kapono, another strong
effort from Matt Barnes and the continued growth of freshman point
guards Cedric Bozeman and Ryan Walcott.</TE>
<TE>   "We really wanted to win for the seniors," Bozeman said. "This
really hurts."</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, Kapono had warned of Arizona's "28-2 runs," and it
turned out he was exaggerating only slightly--the Wildcats used a
27-2 tear to turn a 73-53 deficit into an 80-75 lead with seven
minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   "We showed no poise after they got hot," Barnes said. "We were
dribbling balls off our foot, falling down, it was bad."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins did make one mild counterpunch. Two free throws and a
three-point basket by Barnes and two three-pointers by Kapono cut the
deficit to 87-86 with five minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   But UCLA didn't score again. Three opportunities to re-take the
lead were squandered. Billy Knight missed an open three-pointer and
the next two possessions ended in turnovers, the second triggering a
three-point play by Arizona center Channing Frye, who was fouled by
T.J. Cummings while dunking with three minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder consisted of eight missed shots by UCLA and six
successful free throws by Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "When you come to McKale, you have to do the job for 40 minutes to
have a chance to win," UCLA Coach Steve Lavin said. "Doing it for a
half, or a half and seven minutes, won't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Unless you're the home team. One good half--actually, one great
13-minute stretch in the second half--was all No. 15 Arizona needed.</TE>
<TE>   Frye and forwards Luke Walton and Rick Anderson took advantage of
UCLA center Dan Gadzuric's foul trouble and made easy baskets inside.
Gadzuric played only 18 minutes and fouled out with seven minutes
left. Frye, a 6-foot-10 freshman, made six of six shots and seven of
seven free throws.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, guards Jason Gardner, Salim Stoudamire and Will
Bynum warmed up from long range and turned up the defensive pressure,
denying the Bruins the open looks they had in making 11 first-half
three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   The result was the most stirring Arizona comeback, well, since it
erased a 21-point deficit against Oregon State here Jan. 6.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the most exciting game I've ever played in," Frye said.
"The crowd was just ridiculous. I have never been in a game when the
fans were that loud."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins scored 58 points in the first half and 28 in the
second. They made 11 of 17 three-point shots before halftime and six
of 16 thereafter. Only Kapono, who had 25 points, including 11 in the
second half, played consistently well--although Walton blocked his
layup attempt with 34 seconds to go, sealing the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't show enough poise to make the extra pass or get deep
into the shot clock," Lavin said. "Then we'd miss and allow them to
go boat racing."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA was the one sailing along in the first half, taking an 11-0
lead that became 23-9 when Kapono made the team's sixth three-pointer
without a miss. The Bruins made their first eight shots.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona crept to within 28-22, but Walcott buried his first
three-point basket of the season and Bozeman doubled his season
output with two from behind the arc. For the half, Kapono made four,
Knight made three and Barnes added one.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins were shredding a zone defense that only two nights
earlier had stifled USC. At one point, Knight fed Barnes for an
alley-oop basket and a Wildcat fan yelled, "At least it wasn't a
three-pointer."</TE>
<TE>   At halftime, Arizona Coach Lute Olson instructed his guards to
greet UCLA's ballhandlers closer to midcourt. The adjustment kept the
Bruins from getting open shots from the perimeter early in the shot
clock.</TE>
<TE>   But rather than responding by making an extra pass to get a better
look at the basket, UCLA forced shots, missed most, and Arizona
turned rebounds into fast-break baskets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to get the break going when their shots are going
through the net," Olson said. "We stepped out and created defensive
pressure. And once they started missing, we were able to increase the
offensive tempo."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, turn up the heat.</TE>

<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>It's not bragging if you can back it up, right?</LD>
<LD>   After USC was thumped by Arizona, Trojan senior Sam Clancy said he
wouldn't have any trouble getting up for Arizona State because he was
used to getting routed by the Wildcats before going on to beat the
Sun Devils.</LD>
<LD>   Clancy and the Trojans backed up the boast, beating Arizona State,
81-73, Saturday and remained tied for first place in the Pacific 10
Conference.</LD>
<TE>   With the victory in front of 7,686 at Wells Fargo Arena, No. 18
USC improved to 14-3, 6-1 in conference play.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we bounced back very well and that was a concern of
mine," Coach Henry Bibby said of the Trojans, who were pummeled by
No. 15 Arizona, 97-80, Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We hadn't had a setback like that in a game of that magnitude all
season. But it was nice to see Brandon [Granville] step up and have
the kind of game he had."</TE>
<TE>   Against Arizona, Granville was held scoreless for the first time
since his sophomore year.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, the Trojans' senior point guard rebounded with a
team-high 21 points in 30 minutes. Granville had three assists, one
steal and five turnovers, and made 11 of 11 free throws, equaling
David Crouse for the second most free throws with no misses in school
history.</TE>
<TE>   John Block made 21 of 21 free throws in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I'd be all right," Granville said. "Coach just told me to
play ball. You can't play [scared], looking over your shoulder all
the time. I've been there. I know from experience."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy backed up his words with 20 points and 12 rebounds, his
conference-leading ninth double-double of the season, and also
blocked five shots and had three steals in 40 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Senior forward David Bluthenthal finished with 13 points, freshman
guard Errick Craven had 12 points in 40 minutes and sophomore guard
Desmon Farmer came off the bench to finish with nine points and three
assists in 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State center Chad Prewitt led the Sun Devils with 21
points and 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils (10-7, 3-5) outshot USC from the field, 43.9% to
41.3%, and in three-pointers, 38.5% to 31.8%, and outrebounded the
Trojans, 43-36.</TE>
<TE>   But the Trojans won the game at the free-throw line, making a
season-high 84.6% (22 of 26).</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils made only 18 of 34 (52.9%) free throws.</TE>
<TE>   USC struggled offensively after getting big leads.</TE>
<TE>   After the Trojans went ahead, 22-9, following a Granville layup at
the 14:36 mark, they made only one field goal in the next 4:21.</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils, meanwhile, began solving USC's full-court press
and began pressing themselves as they pulled within 24-21 on a
Prewitt three-pointer with 10:47 to play until the half.</TE>
<TE>   But the Trojans answered with nice ball movement and went on a
10-0 run to take a 34-21 lead on a three-pointer by Craven.</TE>
<TE>   USC managed just two field goals the rest of the half.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State went on an 18-6 scoring spurt to pull within 40-39
on a Kenny Crandall three-pointer at the 1:20 mark.</TE>
<TE>   A Clancy free throw 15 seconds later gave the Trojans a two-point
advantage at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not executing the way we should be," Clancy said. "We were
shooting too many [three-pointers]. That's good when they're going
in, but not when you're bricking every shot."</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils took the lead fewer than four minutes into the
second half when Tommy Smith converted a three-point play to put
Arizona State ahead, 48-45. It was the Sun Devils' first lead since
opening the game with a three-point basket.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State's final lead--56-55--came on a Prewitt basket at
12:05.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next seven-plus minutes, though, USC used a swarming trap
to create turnovers and get easy baskets, going on a 14-3 run to take
a 69-59 lead with 5:16 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Forced to foul, the Sun Devils could only watch as USC made 10 of
11 free throws in the final 54.8 seconds to hold on.</TE>
<TE>   "This is good for us," Bibby said of going 1-1 in the desert.
"When you can go on the road and split, it's successful.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very pleased because they kept playing [after blowing the
three big leads] and we kept our composure."</TE>

<HD>Steelers Brace for the Road-Tested Ravens</HD>
<DH>AFC: Baltimore comes to Pittsburgh with the kind of bravado
that led to a Super Bowl victory last season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>The road to the Super Bowl has been an express lane to victory for
the Baltimore Ravens, one in which no stop is a final stop and every
field becomes their home field.</LD>
<LD>   Even now, heading into today's game at Pittsburgh against the
top-seeded Steelers, who have the NFL's No. 1 defense, the Ravens
feel neither trepidation nor nagging fear of defeat.</LD>
<LD>   After all, the Ravens faced this very scenario last season in the
AFC playoffs at Tennessee and won, and they were the only visiting
team to win in Pittsburgh in Heinz Field's inaugural season. They are
4-0 in the playoffs away from PSINet Stadium the last two seasons.</LD>
<TE>   "What no one thinks is we can get it done playing on the road,
winning on the road, getting back to the Super Bowl," safety Rod
Woodson said. "We can see it, feel it, smell it."</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens (11-6) might be a wild-card team but, in their minds,
they are the team to beat.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers (13-3) think they are the team to beat the Ravens.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just because they have a better record, the advantage of
playing in one of the NFL's loudest stadiums and the confidence
they've built over the course of an impressive season.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers look at the Ravens' No. 2-ranked defense, hailed a
year ago as one of the best in NFL history, and think theirs is
better. They look at the Ravens' offense, one that has become
conservative and run-oriented, and think theirs is better, too.</TE>
<TE>   They look at the confidence-spewing Ravens, who talk a good game
and play a better one, and they see a team they would hate to lose
to--a team that, safety Lee Flowers said, they feel hatred for.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the world champs and they know how to play in the
playoffs and their defense is winning games, but they've got to prove
that [today]," Flowers said. "You can't sit around and tell us how
good you are, you've got to show me how good you are."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides did lots of talking early in the week, but talk only
goes so far when the Super Bowl is two victories away--and the
defending Super Bowl champion is the opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "The experience they have, the road games, the hostile
environments--they're proven," Steelers running back Jerome Bettis
said. "You've got to beat the champ to become the champ. They're
coming in confident, knowing they can win and we've got to go out
there and prove we can beat them."</TE>
<TE>   If Bettis runs as he did while averaging nearly 100 yards per game
for 11 games before injuring his groin, the Steelers might do exactly
that.</TE>
<TE>   But he hasn't played since Dec. 2 and he hasn't had a 100-yard
game against Baltimore since 1997. He came close with 91 yards in the
Ravens' 13-10 victory at Heinz Field on Nov. 4.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers dominated that game statistically, only to lose when
Kris Brown missed four field-goal attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore wouldn't have made it back to the playoffs if it hadn't
won that game.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite honestly, that game feels like it was three lifetimes ago,"
Raven Coach Brian Billick said. "It's about this game and these
circumstances. We've been down that road before."</TE>
<TE>   So have the Steelers. This is the third time under Coach Bill
Cowher they've held home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, but
they didn't get to the Super Bowl in the 1992 and 1994 seasons. Only
one of the last seven top-seeded AFC teams--the 1998 Broncos--reached
the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 Steelers couldn't get there despite playing the AFC title
game at home, losing to Denver, 24-21, when Kordell Stewart had three
passes intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Ravens would prefer to see that Stewart rather than
the confident and error-free Stewart who threw for 569 yards, three
touchdowns and no interceptions as the Steelers out-gained the Ravens
824-390 in their two regular-season games. The Steelers won, 26-21,
at Baltimore on Dec. 16.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I get up for the old Baltimore Ravens," said Stewart, who
made the Pro Bowl, "so I guess it's a great thing we're playing them
now."</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   The Raven defense has allowed 26 points in five playoff games the
last two seasons, including a 20-3 victory in Miami last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Star linebacker Ray Lewis said the Ravens' defense can play a
level above the regular season when it counts, something the
Steelers' defense--with eight new starters since it last made the
postseason--has yet to do.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't have any fear of Baltimore," Steeler tackle Wayne
Gandy said. "We don't have any fear of any team."</TE>

<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>The Patriots have never lost a game played in snow in the history of
Foxboro Stadium, which opened in 1971 and is scheduled for
demolition. A new stadium is being built next door.</LD>
<LD>   Most famous of all: the Snowplow Game.</LD>
<LD>   In 1982, New England beat Miami in the snow when John Smith broke
a scoreless tie in the fourth quarter by kicking a field goal after a
prisoner on work release was called in with a tractor to clear a spot
for good footing.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots are 4-0 on snowy days over the years with victories
over Buffalo, Miami and New Orleans--and the Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   They'll go out undefeated--unless Baltimore beats Pittsburgh
today, which would mean the AFC title game would be played in
Foxboro.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots went from worst to first in the AFC East--and might
just go to AFC champions.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not the underdogs," safety Lawyer Milloy said. "Anybody
who is facing our team has to look at us as a dangerous team. We
believe in ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Sort of.</TE>
<TE>   "We were pushing the envelope a little bit today," kicker Adam
Vinatieri said.</TE>
<TE>   Added running back Antowain Smith: "No words can describe what we
are feeling right now.</TE>
<TE>   "We came back from 10 points behind and tied the game up and won
it in overtime. I think it's characteristic of this team. We've been
fighting adversity all year long.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a scare, no need to lie about that. It was a scare, but we
believed in ourselves. We've been believing in ourselves all year
long. It worked out for us. We won in the end."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patriot quarterback Tom Brady on the fumble reversal call: "You
know, he hit me. I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure. If he hit me, I was
going to throw it, how do you like that?"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Oklahoma State Coach Eddie Sutton saw something familiar in Bob
Knight's Texas Tech team.</LD>
<LD>   Andre Emmett scored a career-high 32 points as the Red Raiders got
their biggest victory under Knight, 94-70, over the sixth-ranked
Cowboys Saturday at Lubbock, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   "[Tech's] motion offense is as good as I've seen one of Bob's
teams play," said Sutton. "I really applaud him for being able to
pull these players together."</LD>
<TE>   It was the first time Knight and Sutton had coached against each
other in 13 seasons. The two faced off four times in the mid-1980s
when Knight was at Indiana and Sutton was at Kentucky. Knight has a
3-2 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech (14-3, 3-2 in the Big 12) had lost its previous two
games but shot a season-high 62%, with Emmett making 14 of 18
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, this has not been a miracle," said Knight of Texas Tech's
turnaround from last season's 9-19 record. "Nobody's walked across
the Brazos and waved a wand at us."</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech also ended a losing streak at nine against Oklahoma
State (15-3, 2-3).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Duke 103, No. 14 Wake Forest 80--Jason Williams had 23
points at Durham, N.C., as one of five double-figure scorers for the
Blue Devils, who went over 100 points for the fifth time this season.
Duke scored 99 in Thursday's victory over No. 3 Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest (13-5, 3-2) shot 56% in the first half, but still
trailed, 61-49.</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 Georgia 84, No. 2 Florida 79--Jarvis Hayes scored 23 points
and twin brother Jonas had 13 at Gainesville, Fla., as the Bulldogs
(15-3, 4-1 in the Southeastern Conference) ended the Gators'
school-record winning streak at 14. Georgia made its final seven
shots to finish at 55%. Florida (15-2, 4-1) shot 40%.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Kansas 74, No. 5 Oklahoma 67--At Lawrence, Kan., Drew Gooden
scored 13 of his 19 points in a 30-8 run to start the second half
that helped the Jayhawks (15-2. 4-0 in the Big 12) end a winning
streak at 13 for the Sooners (14-2, 3-1).</TE>
<TE>   Ebi Ere scored 13 of his 17 points in a 17-5 run that helped
Oklahoma pull within 68-62 with three minutes left, but that was as
close as it got.</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Cincinnati 77, Louisville 50--Steve Logan scored nine of his
21 points in a 17-0 run midway in the first half at Cincinnati that
allowed the Bearcats (17-1, 5-0 in Conference USA) to extend the
nation's longest winning streak to 17.</TE>
<TE>   Louisville (11-5, 2-3) missed 24 of its first 28 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee 66, No. 8 Syracuse 62--At Knoxville, Tenn., senior Jenis
Grindstaff scored a career-high 18 points, including two free throws
in the final seconds, as the Volunteers (7-9) ended a winning streak
at seven for the Orangemen (16-3).</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 Kentucky 72, Notre Dame 65--Keith Bogans scored 23 points
at South Bend, Ind., to lead the Wildcats (12-4) to their eighth win
in a row over the Irish (12-5).</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 Alabama 85, Mississippi State 73--Erwin Dudley scored 24
points and Rod Grizzard had 22 as the Crimson Tide (16-3, 4-1 in the
SEC) beat the Bulldogs (15-4, 2-3) at Tuscaloosa, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern 63, No. 17 Iowa 50--Winston Blake scored 16 points at
Evanston, Ill., as the Wildcats (10-6, 2-3 in the Big Ten) beat a
ranked opponent for the first time in almost three years. It was the
fewest points scored by Iowa (13-7, 2-4) this season.</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Missouri 92, Colorado 77--Kareem Rush matched his season
best with 29 points at Columbia, Mo., as the Tigers (14-4, 4-1 in the
Big 12) won their sixth in a row over the Buffaloes (10-5, 1-3).</TE>
<TE>   No. 24 Miami 102, Providence 96--Darius Rice scored 32 points,
including a basket near the end of regulation, as the Hurricanes
(17-2, 4-2 in the Big East) surpassed their win total from last
season with the overtime victory at Miami. Rice made 13 of 17 shots,
including six of eight from three-point range</TE>
<TE>   Providence (10-9, 1-4) got 31 points from Ryan Gomes.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State 73, No. 25 Indiana 67--Brian Brown had 26 points at
Columbus, Ohio, including four free throws in the final 24.2 seconds,
as the Buckeyes (14-2, 5-0) took over sole possession of first place
in the Big Ten.</TE>
<TE>   Jared Jefferies had 22 points and 10 rebounds for Indiana (11-6,
4-1).</TE>

<HD>Low Road for Clippers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Troubles continue away from Staples Center
for L.A. as Trail Blazers lead by 38 before winning, 113-93.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>No confidence, no rhythm, no spark, no hope. The Clippers looked like
a defeated team from the moment they stepped onto the Rose Garden
court Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   So what else is new?</LD>
<LD>   A 113-93 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers before a sellout crowd
of 19,980 was a little more lopsided than most away from Staples
Center for the Clippers, but it had the look and feel of so many of
their road games.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers reached the season's midway point with a credible
20-21 record, but they are only 3-14 on the road. No other component
of their season has confounded and frustrated the team as its
inability to play with the same passion and energy it has displayed
at home.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the biggest thing that bugs me," Coach Alvin Gentry said
after the Clippers fell behind by 38 points in the third quarter en
route to their sixth loss in eight games. "We've got to keep plugging
away. Nobody said it was going to be easy. We're a work in progress.
If we continue to work, at some point that confidence will kick in on
the road."</TE>
<TE>   There is a great deal to like about the Clippers after 41 games.</TE>
<TE>   After all, it's the first time they have had 20 or more victories
at this point since 1992-93, when they were 22-19 and finished with a
41-41 record and qualified for the playoffs. Last season, they were
13-28 and ended up 31-51.</TE>
<TE>   It's the 24 road games in the final 41 that concerns the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep hoping we'll play as well on the road as we do at home
this season," Eric Piatkowski said. "Hopefully, we don't have to wait
until next season."</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski has been a Clipper for all of his eight seasons in the
NBA, so he is uniquely qualified to comment on the state of the team
at the midway point.</TE>
<TE>   "Our young guys don't play with the same energy," he said. "I
don't know if it's a confidence thing or what. At home Darius [Miles,
a 20-year-old forward] is blocking shots and making dunks and Quentin
[Richardson, a guard in his second season] is hitting every shot.
They are just wonderful players at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if playing on the road is that different from
playing at home. We depend so much on the young guys for energy. We
need them to bring that same energy on the road."</TE>
<TE>   During their victory Friday against the Cleveland Cavaliers, all
of the Clippers made key shots at critical moments. They surged when
they sensed the Cavaliers had weakened in the third quarter and
improved to 17-7 at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday was a far different story for the Clippers, who played
without Lamar Odom (sprained right wrist).</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers made 12 of their first 20 shots (60%) and the
Clippers missed 16 of their first 23 (30.4%), and it didn't take an
advanced degree to figure out which team had the lead after one
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Portland's nine-point advantage swelled to 18 moments before
halftime, after Dale Davis made two free throws for a 56-38 Trail
Blazer lead with 55.7 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers didn't lack for quality shots in the first half. It
was simply that they didn't make enough of those shots, trailing
58-42 at halftime. The Trail Blazers then put to rest any hope the
Clippers had of staging a comeback, building an 87-49 lead midway
through the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Portland made seven of 10 three-point attempts in the third. Only
an 11-0 Clipper run in the final minutes of the quarter kept the game
from turning into a farce. As it was, the Clippers trailed, 92-67,
after three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Damon Stoudamire led the Trail Blazers with a season-high 29
points on 12-for-22 shooting. Miles led the Clippers with a
season-best 20 points in 29 minutes. Richardson had 19 points in 36
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry, having seen enough, benched his starters midway through
the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to make excuses," Elton Brand said. "We didn't come
to play. We've got to learn to play on the road. It's tough playing
on consecutive nights. We didn't get to Portland until 3 a.m., but if
we're going to stay in the playoff hunt, we have to win on the road."</TE>

<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>As expected, Lamar Odom did not play Saturday against the Portland
Trail Blazers. He left the Clippers' victory Friday over the
Cleveland Cavaliers in the third period because of a nagging sprained
right wrist.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers' next move is to be determined.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe it's time to sit him out a few games and see what happens,"
Coach Alvin Gentry said before the Clippers played Portland. "We've
got some games coming up next week that are important to us, but we
need to figure out what we want to do."</LD>
<TE>   Odom was injured after taking a fall in the Clippers' victory Dec.
16 against the Detroit Pistons. He was sidelined Saturday for the
first time since Jan. 2, when he returned to the lineup after a
three-game absence.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry hoped Odom would be fit to play until the All-Star break
next month, when the Clippers have a six-day span without a game and
there would be time to rest and rehabilitate.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we will sit him now and see if that will help," Gentry
said. "He can't be the same player [because of the injury]."</TE>

<HD>Flames Take the Fight Out of the Ducks</HD>
<DH>Hockey: In first meeting since fight-marred Dec. 8 game,
Calgary scores a 2-1 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CALGARY, Canada</DL>
<LD>As with almost every sequel, this one didn't live up to the original.</LD>
<LD>   The Mighty Ducks and Calgary Flames squared off a few times
Saturday. There was finger-pointing, a few group wrestling matches
and some heated words, but it didn't measure up to the
309-penalty-minute melee on Dec. 8.</LD>
<LD>   And the Ducks lost, 2-1, on a deflected shot, but that has become
the norm for Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   "That was the way it was going to be," Duck Coach Bryan Murray
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The heavyweights were going to battle and the cheap shots were
going to come after the fact. They did and we knew that."</TE>
<TE>   A sellout crowd of 17,409 turned out, as the Ducks found
themselves back in the Saddledome again, where friends aren't your
friends. Jeff Friesen and Dave Lowry, teammates in San Jose, jawed
before, during and after one faceoff, certainly discussing Friesen's
comment that Lowry was "gutless" after the Dec. 8 game.</TE>
<TE>   The last stampede in Calgary resulted in suspensions to the Ducks'
Kevin Sawyer and Calgary's Craig Berube and Scott Nichol, as well as
numerous fines.</TE>
<TE>   But after an intense first period, and a few hot spots in the
second, it became a standard game. The Ducks played. The Ducks lost.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary's Chris Clark fired a shot from the right that ticked off
defenseman Ruslan Salei's stick, deflected off goalie Jean-Sebastien
Giguere's glove, then ricocheted off the post and into the net. It
gave the Flames a 2-1 lead 1:35 into the third period.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were not so good at pinball play. Friesen found the puck
at his feet near the net, spun and fired, only to have the puck go
off the post with 2:45 left.</TE>
<TE>   "Every night there is one little play in the game that seems to go
against us," Murray said. "It seems to be the script every night."</TE>
<TE>   If so, the Ducks' body of work rivals Stephen King.</TE>
<TE>   Andy McDonald gave the Ducks a 1-0 lead, taking a pass from Oleg
Tverdovsky and one-timing a shot into the upper left of the net 13:06
into the first period.</TE>
<TE>   But Tverdovsky giveth and Tverdovsky taketh away. His turnover
gave Scott Nichol the puck behind the Duck net. Nichol circled out
and tossed a seemingly harmless effort across the crease that hit
Tverdovsky's skate and went in to tie the score five minutes into the
second period.</TE>
<TE>   "Losers make excuses and that's not what we're doing, but oh boy,
it sure would be nice to get a bounce here or there," Sawyer said.
"If you're winning, the bounces seem to go your way. When you
struggle, it's like Murphy's law."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams have struggled. The Flames had lost four consecutive
games. The victory pulled them within a point of the eighth-place
Kings.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are 1-9-1 in their last 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been close every night, close isn't good enough in this
league," captain Paul Kariya said.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary may be in the playoff hunt. But the Flames went Duck
hunting immediately on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   An active and chippy first period began with Berube and the Ducks'
Denny Lambert going at it.</TE>
<TE>   Even Kariya, a former Lady Bing Trophy winner for most gentlemanly
play, got involved with some shoves and ended up bear hugging the
6-foot-3, 226-pound Robyn Regehr during a fray.</TE>
<TE>   "That was pretty much what I expected," Sawyer said. "Right off
the bat Denny went to battle with Berube.</TE>
<TE>   "My next shift, [Jamie] Allison and I went at. There was still a
lot of emotion.</TE>
<TE>   "It was still an intense game. But both teams wanted the two
points. We didn't get it."</TE>

<LD>This may not have lived up to the hype. But it was in the building.</LD>
<LD>   The Mighty Ducks and Calgary Flames racked up 309 penalty minutes,
which resulted in suspensions and fines, when they played Dec. 8.
They managed only 48 in their rematch Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "I coached Washington for many years and when we played
Philadelphia, it was like that all the time," Duck Coach Bryan Murray
said. "You'd have one of those games and the next game the first 10
minutes was a rat race, with everybody punching everybody. Then you
have to play to get two points.</LD>
<TE>   "We could have ruined [Calgary] and done some things. We don't
want to do that."</TE>
<TE>   The two teams seemed on that road in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   It was obvious that there was unfinished business from the Dec. 8
clash. Denny Lambert and Craig Berube went at it right after a
faceoff just 2:47 into the game.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Sawyer and Jamie Allison wrestled six minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Friesen and David Lowry jawed before, during and after a
faceoff midway through the period. Friesen had called Lowry "gutless"
after the last game.</TE>
<TE>   Ruslan Salei exchanged hacks with several Flame players near their
bench and even accidentally shoved linesman Troy Sartison.</TE>
<TE>   Salei later knocked Flame left wing Ronald Petrovicky into the
net. Petrovicky slashed at goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere as he tried
to get out of the net.</TE>

<LD>Lynwood High was three minutes away from having its hopes for a
perfect girls' basketball season and national championship end.</LD>
<LD>   Both are still alive, however, after an improbable fourth-quarter
rally and a 70-68 nonleague victory over host Lakewood Artesia on
Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   The Knights (18-0), ranked No. 1 in the region by The Times and
No. 2 in the nation by one publication, overcame a 68-57 deficit with
3 minutes 9 seconds left by forcing six consecutive Artesia
turnovers.</LD>
<TE>   Sade Wiley-Gatewood's driving layup with five seconds left broke a
68-68 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Wiley-Gatewood, a sophomore guard, scored 29 points, including 11
of Lynwood's final 15.</TE>
<TE>   Janice Bright added 23 points, 21 in the second half, for the
Knights, who had won their previous four games by an average of 82
points.</TE>
<TE>   Brittney Thomas scored a season-high 20 points for sixth-ranked
Artesia (12-5), which led by as many as 14 points in the first half.
Lindsey Thomas scored 18 points, Cacie Pope had 13 and Lauren Ervin
added 11 for the Pioneers, whose losses have come against nationally
ranked teams Harbor City Narbonne (twice), Mountain View (Utah), Long
Beach Poly and Lynwood.</TE>

<TE>   San Clemente 49, Brea Olinda 42--Lindsey Pluimer scored 23 points
for third-ranked San Clemente, which won for the second time this
season on Brea Olinda's home court.</TE>
<TE>   Pluimer picked up two fouls early in the first quarter and was
charged with her fourth midway through the fourth quarter, but the
sophomore forward was able to score the clinching basket with 23
seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   Sara Brown finished with 15 points, eight rebounds and five steals
for the Tritons (12-3).</TE>

<HD>Kite Stays on Course Despite Strong Winds</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Kite followed his course-record, nine-under-par 63 with a 69 on
Saturday to take a five-stroke lead in the MasterCard Championship,
the Senior PGA Tour's season-opening event at Kaupulehu Kona, Hawaii.</LD>
<LD>   Kite birdied five of the first seven holes, but had two bogeys on
the back nine as the wind picked up on the Hualalai course. He took a
12-under-par 132 total into the final round.</LD>
<LD>   "I wish it was a bigger lead, but any lead is a nice lead," said
Kite, who won the 1992 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in windy conditions.</LD>
<TE>   After favorable conditions in the morning, the wind whipped up,
gusting at 35 mph. The wind shook the palm trees, bent flag sticks
and rattled some players.</TE>
<TE>   Kite had a 31 on the front nine, and a 38 on the back.</TE>
<TE>   "The wind hit us on the seventh hole and from that point on, it
was just an absolute battle," he said. "Very few opportunities to
make birdies. It was difficult to stand over any kind of putt,
whether a 30-foot putt or a two-foot putt."</TE>
<TE>   His first bogey of the tournament came on the 11th hole, when he
three putted.</TE>
<TE>   "The wind just moved that ball out of the hole," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His also bogeyed the 18th after hitting his four-iron second shot
into a bunker.</TE>
<TE>   John Jacobs had a 67 and was at 137, along with Walter Hall (69),
and Bob Gilder (70). Brothers Lanny (69) and Bobby Wadkins (70) were
another stroke behind.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs faced the wind for the last five holes, while Kite had to
deal with it after the seventh hole.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I love it," Jacobs said. "The only thing is, Kite's shorter
than I am, so it doesn't affect him as much as the taller guys."</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Larry Nelson, who was second going into the
round, had a 74 and was at 139, tied for seventh with four others.</TE>
<TE>   Hale Irwin, who won at Hualalai in 1997 and tied for second in
1998 and 2000, made five birdies and a bogey during his 68 and was at
141, along with Tom Jenkins and Gil Morgan, who each shot 70.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Maritz of South Africa shot a nine-under 63 to take a
two-stroke lead after three rounds at the Dunhill Championship in
Johannesburg, South Africa. Maritz had nine birdies and was at
17-under 199 in the $786,000 tournament run by the South African and
European tours.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Foster of England (65) was second at 201, followed by
compatriot Sandeep Grewal (68) at 202.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Els of South Africa shot a 63 and shared fourth place at
203.</TE>

<HD>Coach Is Hotter Than the Spurs</HD>
<DH>Commentary: Popovich says some of his players didn't show
up for Lakers' surprisingly easy victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>So much for that rivalry.</LD>
<LD>   Even with Shaquille O'Neal out, the San Antonio Spurs took a
low-key approach to Saturday's rematch of last spring's Western
Conference finalists, conceding the Lakers were better ahead of the
fact, "the best in basketball right now," as Coach Gregg Popovich put
it.</LD>
<LD>   With nine new players and the fourth-best record in the West when
the day started, Popovich is thinking long-term, hoping to improve
enough by April to be a worthy challenger.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, he didn't think they were going to have to improve that
much.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't compete for 48 minutes," a smoldering Popovich said
after the Spurs had fallen by 17 points, wisps of smoke seeming to
curl from his ears.</TE>
<TE>   "Also, we need to get some better performances out of some people.
... You have to play for 48 minutes if we're going to play the best
team on the planet. We had a couple people who didn't show...."</TE>
<TE>   This seemed pointed at David Robinson. The once-revered Admiral,
now 36 and openly critiqued around town, missed all six of his shots
in the first half, opened the second with a 15-foot airball and spent
the fourth quarter on the bench, finishing with four points and eight
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The loquacious, gracious Robinson, who is known for never ducking
out on the press, no matter how bad things are, ducked out on the
press.</TE>
<TE>   Without the suspended O'Neal and two injured San Antonio
starters--rookie point guard Tony Parker and forward Bruce Bowen--the
game, carried by NBC, had lost its original marquee value long before
tipoff.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Spurs could still look at it as a two-step approach
to getting over their fears of the Lakers, who had swept and
humiliated them last spring:</TE>
<TE>   1) The Spurs would win on their home court, with no O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   2) Thus emboldened, the Spurs could try it again against the
Lakers with Shaq in Friday's return bout in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking for the competitor in them, Popovich said he wanted
O'Neal there so the Spurs could get a better reading on where they
were.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking for himself, the Spurs' Malik Rose said he didn't mind
missing Shaq at all. Noting all the opposing stars who had missed
games here this season--Chris Webber, Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson,
Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Ray Allen--Rose called it "the curse of the
Alamodome."</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate it," Rose added. "Any game you don't have to deal
with [O'Neal] is great."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't turn out to be so great, or any first step, either.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs jumped out to a 12-3 lead. So much for their highlights.</TE>
<TE>   First, they let the Lakers back into the game before Kobe Bryant
started to play well, not a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   Second, they got outhustled, as Mark Madsen beat them to one loose
ball after another.</TE>
<TE>   Then Bryant got hot in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Then Tim Duncan, the gold standard himself, skilled, hard-nosed
and unfailingly competitive, seemed to succumb to the malaise,
scoring but two points in the fourth quarter against Robert Horry,
whom he used to take apart, missing his last five shots.</TE>
<TE>   In one late sequence with the Lakers up, 88-77, Duncan got the
ball in the lane, went up but had the ball stripped away by Horry.</TE>
<TE>   Recovering the ball, Duncan went back up and was stripped by Derek
Fisher, who made a 15-footer at the other end.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan wound up with two points in the final quarter, as many as
Horry and fewer than Madsen (four) or Slava Medvedenko (six), whom
the Spurs knew little about, although he gave them an eyeful
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play hard for 48 minutes as a unit," point guard
Antonio Daniels said.</TE>
<TE>   So why hadn't they played hard for 48 minutes as a unit, in a game
that meant so much to them?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Daniels said. "It's unexplainable."</TE>
<TE>   It's not so unexplainable. The game was a freebie for the Lakers,
who weren't expected to win and had no pressure on them.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Lakers are better, and a lot deeper, than the team that
put the Spurs away last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "Turns out the game wasn't meaningless after all," said San
Antonio News-Express columnist Buck Harvey. "It was only meaningless
if the Spurs won."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it means, the Spurs can't like it.</TE>
<TE>   Let's just say they have a lot of work to do between now and
Friday.</TE>

<HD>Veteran Haas Has Hot Hand at Hope Classic</HD>
<DH>Golf: His second 63 moves him into position to end
nine-year victory drought and claim the title he won in 1988.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA QUINTA</DL>
<LD>It seemed like old times Saturday at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
No, change that. It was old times, especially at Indian Wells, where
48-year-old Jay Haas shot 63 for the second time in four days and
took a one-stroke lead going into today's final round.</LD>
<LD>   If Haas wins, at least he's going to know how to act, because it
would be nearly 14 years to the day that he won the Hope in 1988 at
Indian Wells. Carrying it a step further, if Haas wins, he'll have
PGA Tour victories in four decades. Only Sam Snead and Ray Floyd have
won events in four decades.</LD>
<LD>   No one should expect Haas to need a walker to make it to his
victory speech. Just two years shy of being eligible for the Senior
PGA Tour, Haas has put together the best four consecutive rounds of
his life--63, 68, 68, 63--and is a mere 26 under par at 262.</LD>
<TE>   Haas would like to say he saw all of this coming, but he really
can't,  because he hasn't won in nine years. But he does know what
kind of mind-set has been working for him.</TE>
<TE>   "What you need out here is to be aggressive, take chances when you
can," he said. "But who predicts shooting 26 under for four rounds of
golf?"</TE>
<TE>   Who would have predicted that Kenny Perry and Cameron Beckman
would be the players closest to Haas? Who would have predicted that
Haas and Kirk Triplett would hit golf balls into trees during their
rounds? Who would have predicted that after setting a record with 36
under par in his victory a year ago, Joe Durant would miss the cut?</TE>
<TE>   Haas says he remains confident, knows he's putting well and is
playing from tee to green as well as anyone in the field. But he
didn't want to get too far ahead of himself, which is probably why he
sort of softballed his handicap of the Palmer Course setup for
today's last round.</TE>
<TE>   Said Haas: "There's rough out there. ... There's water, you know,
it's not a pitch-and-putt course."</TE>
<TE>   And this is not a pitch-and-putt tournament, even though the
scores are so low it almost seems that way.</TE>
<TE>   Perry, the 1995 champion when he finished 25 under, blistered the
Palmer Course with a 10-under 62 and moved up from 13th place to
second ... and he's now 25 under with 18 holes  to play. So is
Beckman, who had a 65 at Indian Wells, including a 31 on the front
side, his back nine. Going that low is not familiar territory for
Beckman.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been 25 under after 72 holes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Triplett, Deane Pappas, Brandel Chamblee and David Berganio are
tied for fourth and only two shots from the lead. Duffy Waldorf and
John Senden are within three shots. Also right there, easily within
reach of Haas, is Phil Mickelson, who made the most of Indian Wells
with a seven-under 65. Mickelson is tied with Jerry Kelly at 22-under
266.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone else, it's going to be a stretch to get a winner, but Haas
said he expects low scores again. Somewhere in the mid-30s is going
to get it done, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody could come out of the pack at 23 under, 24 under or 25
under, and it's kind of funny to say that's the pack, but I guess
that's what it's going to be," Haas said.</TE>
<TE>   You might guess you're going to have a good round when you eagle
the first hole, which is what Haas did. He hit a five-wood and pushed
it in the short rough on the right into a divot, then, from 154
yards, pumped an eight-iron at the flag and watched the ball
disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Triplett also watched a ball disappear in his round of 67 at
Indian Wells. At the fifth hole, he hit a three-wood from the middle
of the fairway into a palm tree. "It gobbled it up," said Triplett,
who followed up that bogey with a birdie on the par-three sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Perry was almost stopped before he even began because of a sore
hip that nearly caused him to withdraw before his first round
Wednesday at Bermuda Dunes. He shot a 68 in pain, but wasn't hurting
when he torched the Palmer Course with his 62.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a putting contest," he said. "With no wind, the courses
are defenseless."</TE>

<HD>Stumble Is a Costly One for Siphonic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those who took 10 cents on the dollar weren't too thrilled, but
trainer Dave Hofmans and jockey Jerry Bailey were not dismayed after
Siphonic was beaten in the $150,000 Santa Catalina Stakes Saturday at
Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   The consensus favorite in the future book for the Kentucky Derby,
the 3-year-old had a legitimate excuse for his 51/2-length defeat to
5-1 second choice Labamta Babe in his first race of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   A little more than a month after his authoritative victory in the
Hollywood Futurity, Siphonic, who had $846,155 of the $889,753
wagered in the show pool, stumbled badly at the break, surrendering
several lengths to his five opponents.</LD>
<TE>   After Bailey became certain Siphonic had not injured himself, the
son of Siphon began to rally wide and got to within about a length of
the eventual winner, but was no match in the final eighth of a mile.</TE>
<TE>   To say Siphonic would have won had he left cleanly would be unfair
to Labamta Babe. A Skywalker colt trainer Bobby Frankel has been high
on since he arrived in California last fall, he responded to a more
patient ride and was powerful in the run to the wire and galloping
out past the finish.</TE>
<TE>   Purchased privately by owner Ed Gann after winning one of three
starts in Kentucky, Labamta Babe earned his first victory in this
state. Previously, he had been third in the Hollywood Prevue, then
fourth in the Hollywood Futurity after setting the early pace.</TE>
<TE>   In receipt of eight pounds from the 123-pound highweight and
favorite, Labamta Babe, who was ridden by Kent Desormeaux, completed
the 11/16 miles in 1:42 2/5 and paid $13.20.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel indicated afterward that Labamta Babe could return in the
$250,000 San Felipe Stakes on March 17, and that's also the likely
destination for Siphonic.</TE>
<TE>   "That's an awful thing when horses do that at the gate," said
Hofmans. "Sometimes, they [hurt] themselves, but fortunately it looks
like he didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy with the way he ran. I thought he ran great. I'm glad
Jerry didn't ask him to run until he did. Jerry said he could have
been closer early, but he kept him back. He made the one run, but he
had too much to do. I wish we could have won it, but I thought it was
a great race."</TE>
<TE>   Bailey, the country's leading rider in 2001 and many other years,
said everything was fine with Siphonic before the start and in the
gate.</TE>
<TE>   "He was standing great," he said. "I couldn't have asked him to
stand any better, but he broke so hard that the ground broke out from
under him. His rear end slipped first and he tried to regain himself
and then he stumbled in front.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time he got himself righted, I was eight or 10 lengths
behind. I wanted to give him three-eighths of a mile to see if he was
OK because a lot of times they can strain their back or their belly
when something like that happens. I thought it was a tremendous
race."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the incident at the start, Frankel thought he had a
chance to turn the tables on Siphonic.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought with the weight shift [all horses carried 121 pounds in
the Futurity] I had a chance," he said. "I thought the change in
tactics would help, too, because the last time [Labamta Babe] got
lost on the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't hurt that Siphonic got left. I don't know that we would
have beat him if he hadn't gotten left, but my horse finished really
well. Considering what happened, Siphonic ran a miraculous race."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even though 2001 Kentucky Derby winner Monarchos was third in his
return to the races, Saturday still turned out well for owner John
Oxley and trainer John Ward.</TE>
<TE>   Four races after Monarchos, the 1-2 favorite, was beaten by nearly
nine lengths by Mongoose, the 5-2 second choice, in an allowance race
at Gulfstream Park in Florida, Booklet, who was making his first
start for Oxley and Ward, won the $100,000 Holy Bull Stakes under
jockey Eibar Coa at Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   Purchased privately after he had won for the fourth time in five
starts last Oct. 13 at Calder, Booklet, a son of Notebook and the 7-2
third choice Saturday, led every step of the way and held off 9-10
favorite Harlan's Holiday to win by three-quarters of a length in
1:46 for the 11/16 miles.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>His statue sits in front of the arena.</LD>
<LD>   Playing in Chicago can never be just another game for Michael
Jordan.</LD>
<LD>   "I have too many memories," he said. "It's important for me not to
come back and try to live up to that situation because that's tough.
I may have a good game maybe the next time I come here.</LD>
<TE>   "But to try to compare the two eras or the two situations, it's
very, very tough."</TE>
<TE>   The struggle between past and present was clear Saturday as Jordan
made his first trip to Chicago as a visiting player. The Washington
Wizards beat the Chicago Bulls, 77-69, but Jordan had about as bad a
game as he's ever played.</TE>
<TE>   He tried not to cry as fans gave him a thunderous, three-minute
ovation before the game, and he didn't have much better luck
containing his emotions the rest of the game. He had a career-high
nine turnovers, and was only seven of 21 from the floor for 16
points.</TE>
<TE>   "When the crowd started that whole thing, it made it tough for me
to play," Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   He had 12 rebounds, four assists, two steals and two blocked
shots, but this game won't make any of his many highlight reels.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bull forward Charles Oakley, Jordan's old teammate and
friend, "We laid a big egg. We didn't look good, they didn't look
good. ... It was a bad game."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Whitney led the Wizards with 20 points, 10 coming on free
throws in the final minute. Popeye Jones had 14 rebounds for the
Wizards, who won their 19th game, matching last season's total.</TE>

<HD>Murray Has Goals in Mind for Allison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings have shown that they can win without production from Jason
Allison, going 4-2 over the last two weeks when the slumping center
has failed to score. Before defeating the New York Islanders, 3-0, on
Jan. 5 at Uniondale, N.Y., they had been 0-7-1-1 when Allison hadn't
scored.</LD>
<LD>   But that shouldn't ease his burden, Coach Andy Murray said.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd like to think there's pressure on him every night," Murray
said. "When you have an elite player, he should feel that pressure to
perform every night. I remember reading something about Wayne
Gretzky, saying fear of failure motivated him every night. I hope
Jason feels the same way....</LD>
<TE>   "He's a special kind of player. He should want to be out there
when the game's on the line and he should want to have the puck on
his stick when the seconds are ticking down and we want something
good to happen....</TE>
<TE>   "He wants to be a go-to guy. His agent asked Dave [Taylor, the
Kings' general manager] to make him a go-to guy. That's what we're
expecting out of him."</TE>
<TE>   Allison has one goal and three assists in the Kings' last 11
games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philippe Boucher, who suffered a concussion in Thursday night's
4-2 victory over the Buffalo Sabres, sat out for only the second time
this season Saturday.... Goaltender Stephane Fiset, playing for the
first time since suffering a knee injury in November, stopped 15
shots Friday night for the Kings' American Hockey League team at
Manchester, N.H., in a 4-1 loss to the Cleveland Barons.</TE>

<HD>King Streak Gone in Flash</HD>
<DH>Hockey: After three consecutive victories, they surrender
three goals in first 23 minutes and lose to Islanders, 3-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter how hard they tried, no matter how frantically they
battled, the Kings couldn't sustain the magic Saturday at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Adam Deadmarsh clanged a shot off the left post.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Allison banged one off the right.</LD>
<TE>   Captain Mattias Norstrom, suffering from stomach flu, begged out
after playing only two shifts, leaving the Kings with five
defensemen. Winger Craig Johnson also became ill, leaving midway
through the third period.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in 12 games, they gave up a power-play goal.</TE>
<TE>   It all added up to a well-earned 3-2 victory for the road-weary
but resilient New York Islanders, who, in the last game of a
five-game, 11-day trip, avenged a 3-0 loss to the Kings on Jan. 5 at
Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   In front of a sellout crowd of 18,158, the Islanders surprised the
Kings by scoring three goals in the first 23 minutes, two in the
first 21/2 minutes of the second period, and made them stand up in
ending the Kings' three-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who have outscored their foes by 22 goals in the third
period, mounted a comeback, getting second-period goals from rookie
Adam Mair, his first with the Kings, and Ziggy Palffy, his 12th of
the season and third in four games.</TE>
<TE>   But, despite a determined effort, they were unable to add another,
losing for only the second time in nine games. They are 6-13 in
one-goal games.</TE>
<TE>   "I still believed we could win the game because we'd been playing
so well," winger Steve Heinze said. "I still thought we could pull it
out, but when you start out that slow and that bad, that's a tough
deficit to come back from.</TE>
<TE>   "We just weren't ready. It's a mental game. You've got to be
prepared. We had a day between games, so we weren't tired or
anything. We just weren't ready."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, after losing only three of their previous 19 games, the
Kings had simply come to expect good things to happen for them.</TE>
<TE>   "Complacency?" Heinze asked. "Yeah, maybe you think, 'Jeez, we
keep winning, we'll keep doing it and it's going to be easy.' I hope
it doesn't happen to this team because we've had to work real hard to
get back to where we're at, and we're nowhere near where we want to
be or need to be."</TE>
<TE>   King goaltender Felix Potvin had stopped 28 shots in holding the
Islanders scoreless two weeks ago, but his bid for a second
consecutive shutout against his former team ended only 62 seconds
into the game.</TE>
<TE>   Former Duck winger Kip Miller, leading the American Hockey League
in scoring when the Islanders signed him Wednesday, scored his first
goal for his new team on a shot from the right faceoff circle that
squirted between Potvin's pads.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the period, the Kings killed penalties by Ian Laperriere
and Heinze, running their streak of penalties killed to a club-record
46 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Only 28 seconds into the second period, however, with Mikko
Eloranta in the penalty box for hooking, the streak ended when
defenseman Adrian Aucoin scored on a shot from the blue line, giving
the Islanders a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than two minutes later, Islander winger Mariusz Czerkawski
took a pass from Alexei Yashin and poked the puck into the net for
his 15th goal.</TE>
<TE>   Though they'd given up only eight shots, the Kings trailed, 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure Felix would like to have the first one back, and the
next two we made a couple little mistakes," Coach Andy Murray said.
"But it wasn't like we made a lot of mistakes. They were very
opportunistic, capitalized, battled real hard."</TE>
<TE>   With Norstrom unavailable and Philippe Boucher sidelined after
suffering a concussion in Thursday night's 4-2 victory over the
Buffalo Sabres, the Kings played most of the game without two of
their top defensemen.</TE>
<TE>   Jaroslav Modry logged a season-high 29 minutes 15 seconds of ice
time, and Aaron Miller and Mathieu Schneider also played more than 25
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a long night, but I thought we played pretty well," Miller
said. "But we gave up those goals early and gave up a power-play
goal, which we haven't been doing lately, and that cost us the game."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, their slow start was too much to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like we didn't work hard," Laperriere said. "We did, for
maybe 40 minutes. For 20 minutes, we didn't, and it's tough to battle
back against a team like that, or any team, if you shoot yourself in
the foot early in the game."</TE>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Despite a growing sense among league executives that there might not
be a luxury tax, the Lakers appear no more likely to acquire
front-court help by the Feb. 21 trading deadline.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Jackson has said he would like to add heft behind Shaquille
O'Neal, particularly in light of O'Neal's arthritic big toe, and the
Lakers have a traded player exception to the salary cap.</LD>
<LD>   There is little talent available at what the Lakers would pay,
however.</LD>
<TE>   Also, the final luxury tax numbers won't be available until the
off-season and the Lakers, ever mindful of the tax ceiling,
apparently won't tempt that.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible, though, that the Lakers would pass on a chance to
add a player because of luxury tax implications, only to find there
is no such tax.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant will have his jersey retired at Lower Merion High on
Jan. 26, the night before the Lakers play the Philadelphia 76ers to
start a five-city trip.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 28, later on the same trip, the Lakers are scheduled to
visit the White House to be honored for last season's NBA title. The
Lakers did not make the ceremonial tour last year because of White
House conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As part of a marketing deal, a man dressed as a courier delivered
the basketball to mid-court for Saturday's opening tip.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Joey Crawford, a refreshing character among the NBA's
otherwise dour officials, fished a dollar out of his pocket and
handed it to the guy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were not scheduled to practice today but will
reassemble at their facility in El Segundo on Monday morning. Jackson
said he expects O'Neal at the practice. O'Neal spent the weekend in
Newark, N.J., where he attended his grandmother's funeral. ... Robert
Horry took a Tim Duncan elbow below his right eye late in the fourth
quarter. He said it would not be a bother.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Edges El Salvador in Opener</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico took advantage of a mistake by El Salvador goalkeeper Santos
Rivera on Saturday and went on to win, 1-0, at the Rose Bowl in the
opening round of the CONCACAF Gold Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Rivera's miscue came in the 31st minute when he failed to hold a
low, hard shot by Mexican midfielder Tomas Campos, who had received a
thoughtful square pass from Carlos Ochoa.</LD>
<LD>   When the ball squirted out of Rivera's grasp, forward Jair Garcia
was on hand to direct it into the back of the net.</LD>
<TE>   The result was a fair reflection of the Mexico's domination of the
game. Coach Javier Aguirre fielded what was basically a third-string
lineup, choosing not to antagonize club owners in the Mexican league
by calling on his top players this early in a World Cup year.</TE>
<TE>   It made little difference. El Salvador found it difficult to keep
up with what was a surprisingly fluid Mexican team. Among the
Salvadoran players, only winger Ronald Cerritos, of the Major League
Soccer champion San Jose Earthquakes, and defender Marvin Benitez
showed any flair.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Aguirre said it was too early to say which of his
players had made a case for themselves to be included in the squad
that goes to Japan/Korea '02 this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play too well," he said. "We played nervously. ...
Ninety minutes is not enough to evaluate. I have to watch the whole
tournament."</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican team had come close to scoring on three occasions
before Garcia's goal. In the 19th minute, Garcia flashed a header
over the crossbar. Sixty seconds later, Erick Espinoza sliced a shot
wide right. In the 26th minute, Ochoa, a promising 23-year-old who
played for Azusa Pacific, tried an improbable shot from 25 yards that
dipped and fell onto the roof of the net.</TE>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>I was saving this piece for Valentine's Day to make up for all the
shots I've been taking at Shaquille O'Neal for complaining, or
swelling to the size of the Hindenburg, or just on general
principles.</LD>
<LD>   However, in the wake of his latest embarrassment, it's clear the
big guy needs me now, so here goes:</LD>
<LD>   Roses are red,</LD>
<TE>   Violets are blue,</TE>
<TE>   Dear Superman/Diesel/Big Aristotle/Hindu Elephant or</TE>
<TE>   whatever it is today,</TE>
<TE>   I love you.</TE>
<TE>   I'll tell you the day I fell for the big lug all over again, and
it has nothing to do with titles, MVPs or being put upon by brutes.</TE>
<TE>   It was in November after he was fined for wearing his shorts too
low, and he joked that David Stern wanted him to look like John
Stockton, and someone from the Utah Jazz sent him a pair of
Stockton's size 32s ... and Shaq actually tried to put them on, in
the dressing room, in front of a bunch of TV cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he couldn't get them over his back side, which, let's
face it, is to Stockton's what the Earth is to the moon. The video
ran for a week on the NBA Web site.</TE>
<TE>   In this business, lowlifes often win and good people often lose,
so that what finally counts most is personality and character.</TE>
<TE>   So O'Neal may or may not be the most dominating big man ever (I'd
vote yes), and may not always get it right (I'd vote no), but what
I'll always remember about him is, he's so much fun.</TE>
<TE>   What's better than a star who can stop taking himself seriously
long enough to joke at his own expense?</TE>
<TE>   That's him, the Child Shaq, emerging daily to demonstrate the
sheer delight of Being Shaquille.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, as poor, anonymous people never get to find out,
there's a price to pay for being rich and famous, not that it's so
bad that the rich and famous often renounce their privileges.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq, who is by far the biggest and baddest, gives as well as
receives--remember how he pulverized Dikembe Mutombo in the
Finals?--and has tormentors lined up, girding themselves for the next
campaign. And once in a great while, when they're especially
malicious and/or arrive in tandem, as Brad Miller and Charles Oakley
did, he loses it.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has since holed up, vowing never again to take such abuse,
otherwise refraining from comment, or at least limiting himself to
written messages to the media in his inimitable metaphor-a-day style.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, in his case, "abuse" is a condition of employment
and runs both ways. He won't stop trying to post up in the lane, and
opponents won't stop trying to tow him out.</TE>
<TE>   If he swings on anyone else, he'll be suspended again and will
have to sit still for more Morally Upright columns, while forsaking
another $287,000 a game.</TE>
<TE>   Even at $23 million a year, to paraphrase the late Sen. Everett
Dirksen, 287K here, 287k there, pretty soon you're talking about real
money.</TE>
<TE>   The big question with O'Neal is how willing he is to suffer the
real-world buffeting that comes with Being Shaquille.</TE>
<TE>   Although he rates up there on effort among the great centers, he
isn't a relentless, wake-up-every-day-and-prove-</TE>
<TE>   something competitor like Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant. Every
title O'Neal wins seems to further diminish his interest in the long
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly enough, in flipping out, he actually drew a lot of
sympathy from people in the best position to judge how mightily he
has restrained himself.</TE>
<TE>   Said Orlando Coach Doc Rivers:</TE>
<TE>   "In Shaq's defense, you never want to throw a punch, but he was
provoked. When you see those three and four fouls before that,
there's a way of fouling a guy and then there's a way of fouling a
guy to do some damage."</TE>
<TE>   Said the Celtics' Paul Pierce: "I get hit a lot and I get
frustrated when I don't get the call, but it's nothing compared to
what Shaq goes through. I'm surprised he didn't strike back a long
time ago."</TE>
<TE>   The Big Whatever has shouldered his burden manfully and,
hopefully, has five more years or so in him. Greatness is always in
short supply, and fun is even more precious.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   Quick study: Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban, after defying Stern
repeatedly, paying $1 million in fines and alienating other owners by
tampering with such stars as Karl Malone, senses his madcap style may
not be working. After a report that Stern may start taking draft
picks, rather than money, Cuban told a Dallas radio station: "Now
you're impacting the ability of the team to compete.... You're not
going to give me a chance. Then I'm out."</TE>
<TE>   West is West, East is beneath contempt: Cleveland Coach John Lucas
after losing, 96-64, at Portland: "When you have Ruben Patterson and
Derek Anderson coming off the bench--they'd be stars for me. Shawn
Kemp starts for me. How am I going to win? I just hope it's not [a
loss] by 30." ... Locked into nearly $250 million in long-term
contracts with self-centered Stephon Marbury, fragile Penny Hardaway
and what's left of Tom Gugliotta, the Phoenix Suns may make
hard-driving Coach Scott Skiles take the fall, three years after
choosing him because they said Danny Ainge was too nice, despite the
fact that Skiles has won 50 games annually. Beneath the surface is a
greater fear--that Jason Kidd, who fell out with Skiles, will talk
Shawn Marion into leaving when he becomes a free agent in 2003....
Meanwhile, Hardaway continues to suggest that Marbury move the ball
more: "It takes your teammates to know that you're struggling a
little bit and get you an easy look every now and then. That's not
happening for me, so everything I have to do is created on my own.
That's tough. You can't be successful your whole career shooting jump
shots." ... Proving winning may be irrelevant, the Philadelphia 76ers
have won six of eight and Coach Larry Brown says, "Hopefully our
superstar [Allen Iverson] saying the coach stinks can get us in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Not that fear reigns wherever George Steinbrenner treads but: The
New Jersey Nets are now part of something called YankeeNets, which
has put them under the operational control of NHL Devils boss Lou
Lamoriello. Lamoriello preaches team--not individual--marketing,
which is more appropriate in hockey than in the star-driven NBA. When
Jordan's appearance resulted in the Nets' first sellout of the
season, the PR staff wouldn't even confirm that, even though the
ticket office was reporting everything had been gone for weeks.... Oh
yes, the Nets' publicity director was fired after last season....
Headbands, they don't just keep guys' heads on their shoulders: After
going 2-12, the Detroit Pistons decided to don headbands and beat
Charlotte. The next game, trailing Toronto at home at halftime, the
Pistons took off their white headbands and put on blue ones. Somehow,
the Raptors managed to beat them, anyway.... Orlando's Rivers on
Kidd: "Before the season, we all said it will be an interesting case
study on what's more important to a team, a point guard who runs the
show, runs the team, gets everyone involved or a point guard who gets
his own. That argument has been around for a long time: KJ [former
Sun Kevin Johnson] or John Stockton? I think it's been answered here,
and I don't think there's a question about it.... I think he [Kidd]
absolutely should be a unanimous pick for the All-Star team and right
now is the most valuable player. But he won't get it because his
scoring numbers aren't gaudy, and he doesn't make the great dunks. So
he won't get it, but he should.".... The Jordan-Wizards feel-good
story doesn't feel so good right now. After winning 13 of 15, they
then lost four in a row, including one by 44 points in New Jersey....
Kenyon Martin, who told Jordan his back was hurting him in the last
meeting, whereupon Jordan torched him for 45: "He asked me how I
feel. I told him I feel great." ... San Antonio's Charles Smith, told
before the game he'd be guarding Jordan: "I was like, 'Ohhhh, OK.'"
... Said Smith after scoring a career-high 21 points while Jordan
shot five for 21: "I don't want to play him no more. Once is enough."</TE>

<HD>Mutombo Makes Smaller Knicks Pay</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Dikembe Mutombo gave the Philadelphia 76ers more than they expected.</LD>
<LD>   Mutombo finished with a season-high 24 points and 16 rebounds to
lead the 76ers past New York, 97-89, on Saturday night, extending the
Knicks' losing streak to seven games.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone has their role, but when you can do your role plus, that
makes us a championship-caliber team," said Allen Iverson, who scored
34 points. "We needed it, we need everything we can get."</LD>
<TE>   Mutombo made 10 of 15 shots from the field and the 76ers achieved
their goal of exploiting their height advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "We were able to take advantage of our size tonight," Mutombo
said. "My team gave me a chance to get some touches and we
responded."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Snow added 15 points and Corie Blount, starting in place of
the injured Derrick Coleman, had 15 rebounds for the 76ers, who
outrebounded New York, 56-39, and won their fourth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   "They really dominated us on the boards," said New York's Latrell
Sprewell, who scored 32 points. "We felt we were containing them on
defense, especially in the first half, but they kept hitting the
boards."</TE>
<TE>   The 76ers finished with 24 offensive rebounds. The Knicks had just
nine.</TE>
<TE>   "They got too many second shots, you just can't do that," Knick
Coach Don Chaney said. "You have to be aggressive on the boards,
especially against a good team."</TE>
<TE>   Allan Houston added 25 points for the Knicks, who are mired in
their longest losing streak since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks pulled to within 76-73 before Philadelphia used a 10-6
run to extend its lead to 86-79 with 3:20 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The 76ers' defense then forced New York into a shot-clock
violation and Aaron McKie hit an eight-foot jumper with 2:05
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks closed to within four points in the final minute, but
Iverson made six free throws to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 75-61 early in the fourth, New York used a 12-1 run to
pull within 76-73.</TE>

<LD>Russia's Maria Butyrskaya reclaimed the women's title from defending
champion Irina Slutskaya in the European Figure Skating Championships
on Saturday at Lausanne, Switzerland, but in less-than-glorious
fashion.</LD>
<LD>   Butyrskaya faltered on three jumps in the long program, completing
only five triples for technical marks from 5.1 to 5.7.</LD>
<LD>   Slutskaya won the final free program, hitting six triples but no
triple-triple combination.</LD>
<TE>   After finishing third in the short program, Slutskaya needed to
beat Butyrskaya and have someone else beat her, too. That didn't
happen.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Volchkova finished third, giving Russia its fourth
consecutive sweep.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to do the individual elements, but it's only the third
time I'm doing the full program," Butyrskaya said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have mistakes and problems with the program, but I think it
will be OK by the Olympics. I still have a month to go."</TE>

<HD>This Job Was One-Year Wonder</HD>
<DH>NFC: Smith quickly rebuilt Ram defense, which has quietly
turned from a problem area into league's No. 2 unit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Quarterback Kurt Warner, he of the bruised vocal cords, barely
uttered a sound for most of the week.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to the club.</LD>
<LD>   The St. Louis defense has been operating with near-silent
efficiency all season, tiptoeing its way to a No. 2 ranking in the
NFL. Then again, it's hard to hear anything over the jet-engine
scream of the Ram offense.</LD>
<TE>   "It's something that we've been dealing with since I've been
here," said defensive end Grant Wistrom, whose team will play host to
Green Bay today for the right to play in the conference championship.
"We have a fantastic offense and they deserve all the credit that
they get. They are without a doubt the best offense in the NFL. So,
yeah, we're going to get overshadowed. But we don't care. We go out
there and do our thing every week."</TE>
<TE>   Wistrom &amp; Co. are mercenaries with no mercy. They pulled off a
defensive U-turn this season that was every bit as impressive as the
franchise-wide resurrection of the Chicago Bears or New England
Patriots. Shaky last season, the revamped defense gave up 1,203 fewer
yards and 198 fewer points this season, paring its points allowed
from 29.4 a game to 17.</TE>
<TE>   All of a sudden, the Trans World Dome was a no-fly zone for
visiting teams.</TE>
<TE>   These things don't happen by accident, nor do they come without a
reshuffling of coaches, players and philosophies. After last season,
Coach Mike Martz fired defensive coordinator Peter Giunta and
replaced him with Lovie Smith, who spent the previous five seasons
coaching linebackers for Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   A change at the top led to changes throughout the defense. The
Rams have 16 new players on the defense's roster of 25, with seven
new starters and eight first-year NFL players. Smith brought in
respected veterans such as cornerback Aeneas Williams from Arizona,
safety Kim Herring from Baltimore, linebacker Mark Fields from New
Orleans and defensive end Chidi Ahanotu from Tampa Bay. The Rams also
used their first five draft picks on players for their defense--three
in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "We already had a great offense in place here," Smith said. "We
couldn't really say, 'Hey, guys, give us three years to get it
right.'"</TE>
<TE>   In general, it's easier to turn a defense around quickly. For
instance, a defensive lineman can have a great game if he makes three
plays; an offensive lineman can lose his job if he blows three plays.</TE>
<TE>   Still, doing what Smith did--pulling off a one-year makeover of a
defense that gave up 471 points last season, seventh-most in league
history--is remarkable. He imported Tampa Bay's defense, which puts a
premium on speed and athletic ability rather than sheer size.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole basis of our defense is to let them get off the ball
and just react on the run," he said. "We want them to have an
aggressive mentality. If you do that, you can get away with smaller
players."</TE>
<TE>   The premier talent on the Ram defense is Williams, who made his
seventh Pro Bowl team this season and returned two interceptions for
touchdowns. He's also a leader in the locker room, even though he has
played in only two postseason games.</TE>
<TE>   "We ask him, 'Now, how far did you go with the Cardinals?' to
remind him that it's all new to him," cornerback Dexter McCleon said.
"He's excited. This is what he came here for. It's something he's
been waiting for since he walked through that door for the first
minicamp. He can't wait, we all can't wait. We all want to get there
for him."</TE>
<TE>   Challenge No. 1: Put the clamps on Green Bay quarterback Brett
Favre, a three-time most valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   "He is so confident that he's not afraid to attempt to get balls
in situations that maybe somebody else wouldn't try," Williams said.
"He has had so much success doing that, and his guys have come up
with some big plays."</TE>
<TE>   The Ram defenders will be looking to make a few big plays of their
own, and there's a good chance they will. A guy named Lovie believes
in them.</TE>
<TE>   Incidentally, Smith got his first name because his mother was
anticipating a girl. "Lovie" stuck.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people ask me if I had any trouble with it growing up; I
really didn't," said Smith, a three-time all-Missouri Conference
defensive back at Tulsa. "To be truthful, you remember it. If I was
Joe, I'd be just another Joe."</TE>
<TE>   Not likely.</TE>

<HD>Bears Take Exception to Douglas' Hit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bears lost starting quarterback Jim Miller early in the second
quarter. Miller suffered a separated right shoulder after throwing an
interception and taking a big hit from Philadelphia's Hugh Douglas.</LD>
<LD>   Miller and Douglas shouted at each from across the field after
Miller came back from the locker room, where his shoulder was
examined. Miller wouldn't say whether he thought Douglas' hit was
fair.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to comment until I see the tape," Miller said. "I'd
hate to say something stupid until I see what happened."</LD>
<TE>   It appeared the hit was legitimate. Damon Moore intercepted
Miller's pass and it was during the 18-yard return that Douglas hit
Miller.</TE>
<TE>   But Miller's replacement, Shane Matthews, took exception to the
way Douglas took out Miller. "The shot that put Jim out was dirty. It
was uncalled for and it's a shame," Matthews said.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," he said, "he acted like he was going to try and make the
tackle. He moved.... When he stood there, I just stood in front of
him. But when he moved, I put him down.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a clean block. Afterward all their guys came up to me and
got after me. Not to be cruel, but I don't care. He moved and when he
did, I hit him."</TE>
<TE>   This might have been Miller's last game as a Bear. He is an
unrestricted free agent, though he said he'd like to return.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the season, the word from Chicago was that
third-year Coach Dick Jauron would be fired after this year.
Saturday, before the Bears were eliminated from the playoffs, Jauron
was named Associated Press coach of the year for leading them to
their first NFC Central title since 1990 and first playoff appearance
since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Though Jauron has yet to receive a contract extension, General
Manager Jerry Angelo has said Jauron will be back next season. Jauron
said he didn't want to think about the honor or the contract after
the tough loss.</TE>
<TE>   "What I told the team was ... I just wanted to talk about what we
all just came through," he said. "I don't think I'll ever forget this
team or this staff."</TE>

<HD>Roy, Blake Help Fend Off Sharks</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Goalie stops 22 shots and defenseman has two
assists to lead Colorado over San Jose, 3-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Patrick Roy stopped 22 shots and Rob Blake had two assists to lead
the Colorado Avalanche over the San Jose Sharks, 3-1, Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Radim Vrbata, Chris Drury and Martin Skoula scored for Colorado,
and Blake assisted on Colorado's two power-play goals. The Stanley
Cup champion Avalanche killed San Jose's seven power-play
opportunities and beat the Sharks for the first time in three tries
this season.</LD>
<LD>   Four days after Evgeni Nabokov stopped 38 shots in a masterful
shutout win over the Avalanche at Denver, Roy returned the favor with
an impressive performance, although he couldn't hold on for what
would have been his 60th career shutout.</LD>
<TE>   Patrick Marleau's goal with 12:25 to play denied Roy of his eighth
shutout this season. Roy already has matched the highest season
shutout total of his career while posting a goals-against average
lower than any in his career.</TE>
<TE>   After getting shut out by Nabokov in each of their previous
meetings with the Sharks this season, the Avalanche jumped to a 3-0
lead in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Nabokov stopped 24 shots, but Colorado's defense gave almost no
openings to the Sharks, who have scored only seven goals in their
last four games.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche took sole possession of first place in the Northwest
Division.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose had few scoring chances in the first two periods against
Blake and the Avalanche's solid team play, although Roy nearly gave
up a goal in the second period when he was slow back to his crease.
Marleau got a pass in front but missed with the shot.</TE>

<LD>It isn't enough that coaches Jim O'Brien and Jim O'Brien have the
same name, they also seem to constantly cross paths, look alike and
now mirror each other's success.</LD>
<LD>   Ohio State's O'Brien led the Buckeyes to another victory Saturday,
73-67, against No. 25 Indiana to improve to 14-2.</LD>
<LD>   The Boston Celtics' O'Brien has his team in second place in the
Atlantic Division, after the failed Rick Pitino experiment.</LD>
<TE>   Celtic O'Brien is becoming a beloved figure in Boston. Buckeye
O'Brien coached at Boston College for 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   Celtic O'Brien was an assistant to Pitino with the New York Knicks
from 1987-89 just after Buckeye O'Brien coached at a New York school,
St. Bonaventure.</TE>
<TE>   Celtic O'Brien once coached at Dayton--in Ohio where Buckeye
O'Brien now rules--for five years.</TE>

<HD>Stanford's Style Points Are Key</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A different style still meant the same results as No. 19 Stanford
raced to yet another victory over Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Casey Jacobsen scored 21 points and Curtis Borchardt had 19 at
Palo Alto as the Cardinal remained undefeated at home this season
with a 105-60 victory over the Huskies on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Julius Barnes had 15 points as Stanford (11-4, 4-2) extended its
winning streak over the Huskies to nine consecutive.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't have the big bodies up front anymore, so we have to play
more of a full court game," Borchardt said. "Jason and Jarron
[Collins] just swallowed up rebounds. We don't have that this year,
so we have to be more intense."</TE>
<TE>   David Dixon recorded his fourth double-double of the season with
16 rebounds and 13 points to lead Washington (7-11, 1-7), which lost
its sixth consecutive on the road. Doug Wrenn had 16 points and
Curtis Allen had 13.</TE>
<TE>   It was Stanford's largest margin of victory ever against
Washington, and the most points the Cardinal have scored against the
Huskies. It was Washington's third-worst loss ever.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a lot better after this weekend," said Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery, whose team plays at UCLA on Thursday and at USC on
Saturday. "We know it's going to get a lot tougher."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 Oregon 63, Oregon State 51--Frederick Jones scored 16
points and Robert Johnson had 11 rebounds as the Ducks stayed tied
for first place in the conference with a victory at Corvallis, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Luke Jackson had 15 points for Oregon (14-4, 6-1), which is a
surprising contender nearing the midpoint of the conference schedule.
Oregon is tied with USC for first.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have won 10 of 11 games and already have exceeded their
conference victory total from last season, when they were 5-13.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Ricci had 12 points and seven rebounds to lead Oregon State
(8-9, 1-6), which has lost six consecutive to its rival.</TE>
<TE>   The Beavers, who haven't had a winning season since 1989-90, are
fighting to avoid being one of the bottom two teams in the Pac-10 and
getting left out of the conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   California 90, Washington State 57--Amit Tamir scored 17 points to
lead the Golden Bears over the Cougars at Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Jamal Sampson and A.J. Diggs each had 12 points and Brian Wethers
had 11 as California (13-3, 4-2) handed Washington State (4-11, 0-8)
its 10th consecutive defeat. Sampson, a 6-foot-11 freshman center
from Santa Ana Mater Dei High, also had a game-high nine rebounds in
only 23 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears shot 53% from the field, including eight of 14 by Tamir,
who was one of 10 in a 62-50 victory over Washington on Thursday. It
was the Bears' second-best offensive output of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Moore had 13 points and Shaminder Gill and Justin Lyman
each had 12 for the Cougars, who committed 22 turnovers.</TE>

quarter as Fresno Clovis West used its press to rally for a 58-54
intersectional victory over Pasadena Muir in a boys' basketball game
Saturday in the McDonald's Invitational at Pasadena City College.</LD>
<LD>   Trailing, 55-54, Muir had a chance to win the game, but Debban
blocked Jamaal Hall's driving shot in the lane and grabbed the ball.
Hall wrapped up Debban and was whistled for an intentional foul with
2.8 seconds left.</LD>
<LD>   Debban made both free throws to give Clovis West (17-2) a
three-point lead, then put the game out of reach by making another
free throw with 2.1 seconds to play.</LD>
<TE>   Hall had 14 points for Muir (18-2), which lost for the second

<DH>Wrestling: Bakersfield runs away with the team championship
as four Drillers win individual titles.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once Bakersfield High pulled into the Fountain Valley High parking
lot Saturday at the Five Counties wrestling tournament, the only
thing left to settle were the individual titles.</LD>
<LD>   Bakersfield ran away with the tournament by qualifying nine
wrestlers for the championship quarterfinals. Six made it to the
finals and four won titles. The Drillers amassed 219 points.</LD>
<LD>   Clovis Buchanan was second with 156 points, Clovis third with 140,
Poway fourth with 131 and Temecula Valley fifth with 114.</LD>
<TE>   Temecula Valley got a boost when top-seeded Jeff Bristol defeated
Villa Park's Buck Barger, 9-4, in the 140-pound final. Bristol has
three wins over Barger this season. "This isn't going to be the last
time we meet up," said Bristol, who became friends with Barger when
the two wrestled in a national event last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana and Arroyo Grande qualified two wrestlers each for the
finals. Arroyo Grande's Kirk Davis, seeded third, defeated
sixth-seeded Jimmy Becerra of Santa Ana, 12-8, in the 189-pound
final.</TE>
<TE>   Becerra reached the final after pinning top-seeded Daniel Folmer
of Buchanan. Arroyo Grande's Arturo Basulto, top-seeded in the
heavyweight division, reached the final, where he lost to
fourth-seeded Kyle Devan of Vacaville, 3-2, in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana's Fernando Jaimes, seeded sixth, lost to top-seeded Drew
East of Bakersfield, 21-6, in the 152-pound final. Santa Ana Calvary
Chapel, which sent six wrestlers to the finals last year en route to
its second consecutive title, had just one finalist, top-seeded Joe
Williams, who won by injury default over Peter Gladish of San Diego
Mt. Carmel. The Eagles finished 11th with 78 points.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo's Jake Nishimura was one of two unseeded wrestlers to
reach the finals, where he faced top-seeded Gerrard Contreras of
Buchanan at 103 pounds. Nishimura lost a 3-1 decision to Contreras,
who was third last year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forever the Raiders have tried to snow us with the Raider Way,
paranoid at every turn that there was a plot underway to swipe their
greatness, pitting the Raider Nation against the rest of the
well-behaved world.</LD>
<LD>   The gap will widen now with the "Snow Job," Oakland knocked out of
the AFC title game with maybe the worst, and most costly referee's
interpretation in NFL history--conclusive proof the NFL was willing
to go to any lengths to just win, baby.</LD>
<LD>   Both God and the NFL planned it this way, of course, God doing his
part with the snow and the NFL assigning referee Walt Coleman to the
game.</LD>
<TE>   Now any other team playing against the Patriots, the game is over
and they win. There is no question quarterback Tom Brady was making
no attempt to throw the ball, he fumbled, and that would have been
that.</TE>
<TE>   But as the Raiders would tell you, instant replay was designed to
get them, and for all they know, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue was
talking into Coleman's ear, telling him he doesn't give one Holly
Roller hoot what the replay shows, the Pats are going to tie this
game.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, of course, is also flipping the two-headed coin Tagliabue
had given him--allowing New England to get the ball first in
overtime, and then steal the playoff victory that had already
belonged to the Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   At least that's how Al Davis' lawsuit is probably going to read
today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I DIDN'T write much this week because the editors had me toiling
elsewhere, which explained the line at the bottom of Page Two: "T.J.
Simers is on assignment.''</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday my assignment was to play golf with Dodger Manager Jim
Tracy. On Wednesday my assignment was to play golf with South Hills
Country Club PGA professional Wade Berzas. No one would come out and
play with me Thursday, so I returned to work.</TE>
<TE>   I was with Tracy at the Cascades in Sylmar when word came by cell
phone Gary Sheffield had been traded, and I can tell you of the 140
to 150 shots Tracy took that day, his very best came right after
learning of the deal. You can't believe how far that thing rolled.</TE>
<TE>   Picture Eric Karros trying to hit a baseball and you have a good
idea what Tracy looks like when he swings a golf club. That reminds
me--major league baseball should probably allow Karros to use a cart
in order to speed up play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I GOT the impression from Tracy--following each shot and the wait
for him to emerge from the woods after finding his ball--that like
most of you, he was tired of the Sheffield thing, Sheffield's
September swoon and clubhouse tension.</TE>
<TE>   I understand the "Sheffield thing," and his disappearing act down
the stretch, but I'm having a little trouble with "clubhouse
tension."</TE>
<TE>   I think I know something about clubhouse tension--standing in
front of Kevin Brown's locker for most home games--and while I can't
imagine Brown or Sheffield tossing a Mister Rogers Neighborhood wink
at Karros, it certainly wouldn't help him hit the ball more often.</TE>
<TE>   Salma Hayek tossing a wink at Karros wouldn't help, although it
would be the first time I was impressed with Karros.</TE>
<TE>   Now I admit I talk more softly whenever I'm close to Shawn Green
to avoid spooking him, and it probably means something to Chad
Kreuter that he doesn't have to keep his baseball caps under lock and
key. But the suggestion Sheffield's dismissal will improve team
chemistry within the clubhouse is ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   A first-rate closer will improve team chemistry. A leadoff hitter
will improve team chemistry. More vacation time for the Page Two
columnist will improve team chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   The pure baseball decision to trade Sheffield, who has probably
been the most dynamic offensive performer in L.A. Dodger history over
a three-year span of time, makes sense only for Atlanta. Sheffield
gives the Braves a chance to compete with the Mike Piazza Mets for
postseason play, and maybe the chance to play the Pedro Martinez Red
Sox in the World Series. The Dodgers are very good at improving team
chemistry throughout the league.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DODGERS haven't done many things well in recent years, but
they've done a splendid job in portraying Sheffield as someone who
just had to go.</TE>
<TE>   Times lead sports columnist Bill Plaschke told us last week the
reason the Dodgers traded Sheffield to Atlanta was because some
unnamed Dodger official thought Sheffield might punch someone in
spring training.</TE>
<TE>   Plaschke then ran down the list of those who might be punched with
the unnamed Dodger official, and the unnamed Dodger official came to
the conclusion no one would be punched, but what the heck--Plaschke
concluded--trade him anyway because some unnamed Dodger official came
up with the cockamamie notion someone might be punched.</TE>
<TE>   My guess is that Dodger official Bob Daly never got over being
blasted by Sheffield before last season, and to justify giving
Sheffield away in a lopsided trade he wanted the public to think no
one could get along with this guy.</TE>
<TE>   The fact so many Dodger fans were happy to see Sheffield go, while
admitting Atlanta got the better end of the deal, demonstrates a lot
of people read Plaschke, and Daly was successful.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's Tracy's job to win with a room of "choirboys," as he
calls the good guys in sports, and while he's bullish on the new
year, I told him he'll be playing golf around Oct. 1 when the
playoffs begin.</TE>
<TE>   He's too nice to say, "If you're so smart, buster, what would you
have me do?"</TE>
<TE>   But he did say: "Do you have a better idea?"</TE>
<TE>   "Sure. Put away the clubs, and take up bowling."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from (The Rev.) Scott
Kingsbury:</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knows Clint Eastwood's 'Dirty Harry' Callahan used a .44
magnum--'the world's most powerful handgun,' and not a .357."</TE>
<TE>   And what would Dirty Harry say while passing the collection
plate....</TE>

<HD>Fullerton Gets Unlikely Victory Against Utah State</HD>

<LD>Forward Pape Sow scored a game-high 20 points before fouling out and
guard Kevin Richardson had 11, all in the second half, as Cal State
Fullerton ended a seven-game losing streak with a 65-51 victory at
home against Utah State.</LD>
<LD>   Richardson had all of his 11 points, and Sow had 10 during a
deciding 10-minute span when Fullerton took command with a 29-15 run
that earned the Titans their first Big West Conference victory in
almost a year.</LD>
<LD>   Utah State (13-4, 5-3), which had defeated Fullerton four
consecutive times and won 14 of the last 15, fell to the Titans for
the first time since Feb. 4, 1998. Fullerton (4-12, 1-6), won for the
first time since defeating Sacramento State in mid-December, and
earned its first conference victory since defeating UC Riverside last
February.</LD>
<TE>   "Their [Utah State's] intensity hadn't been what I had seen in the
first half, and they couldn't get it back," said Titan Coach Donny
Daniels. "But our guys had played extremely well. We got some breaks,
made our foul shots down the stretch, and protected the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Utah State's Desmond Penigar, a junior from Upland, finished with
a team-high 17 points and nine rebounds.</TE>

<LD>In five months, Gary Murphy will lock the door to the Chaminade High
principal's office, get into his truck and drive away, ending a
six-year reign at the West Hills campus.</LD>
<LD>   He's leaving as a visionary, someone who has not been afraid to
challenge assumptions and demonstrate leadership in a time of
turmoil.</LD>
<LD>   It was Murphy's decision in the fall of 1999 to no longer accept
students transferring to the Catholic school solely for athletic
reasons.</LD>
<TE>   Several of his coaches weren't pleased. It put Chaminade at a
disadvantage because most schools wouldn't think of taking such a
drastic philosophical stance.</TE>
<TE>   "There are coaches who aren't against the theory but feel like
they have to compete with one hand tied behind their back, and I
acknowledged that," Murphy said. "But it seems to me if you're not
going to stand up for the right things, it doesn't matter if you
win."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, he started lobbying his fellow Mission League principals to
pass a rule making students who transfer within the league ineligible
to compete at the varsity level for one year unless they receive a
hardship waiver.</TE>
<TE>   There was resistance. It took 18 months of prodding before the
rule was passed. It went into effect in January.</TE>
<TE>   "We need more people to be convinced they can make a difference,"
he said. "Everybody complains how bad it is. They claim there [isn't]
anything they can do. That's not true. It's relatively easy if you
don't care what people say about you. What I hope I have done is
create a climate where it is safe to say, 'We're going to play by the
rules.'"</TE>
<TE>   Murphy, 45, has been a trendsetter in trying to develop a response
to the surge of high school athletes changing schools. There have
been close to 3,800 transfers in the Southern Section since 1999 and
945 in the City Section in the same span.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the transfers are based on athletic reasons, but the
movement of so many athletes creates animosity, suspicion and has the
potential of turning friends into bitter enemies.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more concerned with the issue of high school athletics in
general and the role adults play in it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the coach who knowingly breaks the rules. It's the
administrators who look the other way at best and promote it at
worst. Kids, ironically, aren't the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy's solution is to institute rules that discourage transfers.
His logic: College athletes have to sit out a year when they
transfer. Why shouldn't the same rule apply in high school?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see a lot of athletes [transferring] because they want to
become better competitors," he said. "They do it because of the dream
of a college scholarship, glory, and some of them think there's money
down the road in the pros. And for some, there is.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't blame any parent for wanting to maximize their son's or
daughter's talent athletically. But it has to be done within
reasonable parameters. There has to be a cost. It can't be the way it
is now. I don't mean it to be punitive. If it's that important [to
transfer], you have to give up something."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy was a cross-country and track coach at Encino Crespi for 10
years before he became an administrator. When he applied to be
principal at Chaminade, there was little said in the job description
about the role of sports. Then he learned, like most principals, how
much time he must devote to the school's athletic program.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is, on a day-to-day basis, athletics and
athletic-related issues can take up to 20% and sometimes 60% of your
day," he said. "The overemphasis we put on sports from the pro level
to college to high school is not good. We've got people dying half a
world away, and I'll get angry phone calls about a freshman not
making the JV team. There's something wrong with that."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said high school athletes are taking huge risks if they
don't prepare for life without sports.</TE>
<TE>   "I worry about kids who put everything in one basket, all their
hopes, giving up other sports, moving residences and putting all
their eggs into this dream to be a great athlete," he said. "I just
worry what happens when it doesn't happen because it doesn't happen
more often than it does."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy might seem a casualty of the transfer issue, since he's
surrendering a powerful position at a time when debate is focused on
whether reform is needed. But he's not leaving because of outside
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   He has chosen to return to teaching, his real love, and plans to
stay involved in athletics.</TE>
<TE>   "From the outside, I think I can continue to light a fire under
people," he said. "I think there's going to be a revolution."</TE>
<TE>   A transfer controversy involving Woodland Hills Taft and Van Nuys
Birmingham presents more evidence that high school sports have
reached a breaking point.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Taft basketball Coach Derrick Taylor removed
high-scoring senior guard Mustafa Asghari from the team for shooting
too much and not following directions. Birmingham Coach Al Bennett
removed sophomore guard Jordan Farmar from his team after learning
that Farmar planned to transfer to Taft for academic reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Asghari has since changed his residence and transferred to
Birmingham, making him eligible immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Farmar is apparently transferring to Taft on Feb. 1 but won't be
eligible until next season.</TE>
<TE>   Is Asghari wrong for pursuing his dream to play college ball? Is
Farmar wrong for wanting to switch schools to take specialized
classes?</TE>
<TE>   Were the coaches wrong for exercising their authority to make team
decisions?</TE>
<TE>   All of them have valid points, but the line separating right from
wrong is blurred.</TE>
<TE>   Both players followed the rules, but since Asghari's family chose
to move, he gets to keep playing. Farmar isn't moving and won't be
playing.</TE>
<TE>   It's just another example of the confusing, unequal playing field
in high school sports.</TE>

<HD>Time Is on Northridge's Side in Upset of Irvine</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Bobby Braswell preached it again and again, even to those with their
hands over their ears. From the beginning of the season, he
repeatedly said his team needed one thing and one thing only: Time.</LD>
<LD>   It seemed like Cal State Northridge needed more than that after a
horrific start to the season, a 1-7 beginning that included a
34-point loss to Howard.</LD>
<LD>   But the Matadors' time may have arrived, evidenced by a 73-72
overtime victory at UC Irvine in a Big West Conference game Saturday
before 3,350 at the Bren Center.</LD>
<TE>   Markus Carr scored a career-high 31 points and the Matadors (6-10,
5-2 Big West) ended Irvine's 19-game home winning streak despite
trailing by 20 midway through the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully this will be a defining moment for this basketball
team," said Braswell, who guided a senior-laden Matador team to their
first NCAA tournament appearance last season. "I don't know if
anybody believed me, but I knew we were going to struggle [early this
season]. We had to find the positives and keep coaching."</TE>
<TE>   Carr missed a left-handed floater with one second left that could
have won the game in regulation, but he atoned by scoring five of the
Matadors' 11 points in overtime. Lionel Benjamin scored from down low
with 25.8 seconds left in overtime to give the Matadors the lead for
good.</TE>
<TE>   Stanislav Zuzak missed an off-balance shot from the free-throw
line as time ran out for Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Zuzak and the Anteaters (13-5, 6-1) were unstoppable early, taking
a 29-9 lead with 8:43 left in the first half. Zuzak contributed nine
points during the run.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this was an upset," Carr said. "I think we came in
playing our game."</TE>
<TE>   Zuzak had 17 points, Adam Parada had 19 and Jerry Green had 16 for
Irvine. The Anteaters made 21 of 32 free throws (65.6%) and missed
four in the final two minutes. "If we make our free throws, we win
the game," Coach Pat Douglass said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bresnahan</TE>

<TE>   Long Beach State 78, Pacific 74--Travis Reed's three-point play
with 20 seconds left gave the struggling 49ers a Big West Conference
victory before 1,593 at the Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   Reed notched his sixth double-double of the season with 19 points
and 10 rebounds. He made seven of 11 shots, the last being one that
Long Beach (6-12, 2-5) needed.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied at 74, Tony Darden missed a three-point shot.
Reed grabbed the ball in traffic and banked in the follow shot,
drawing a foul on Pacific's Mike Preston. A 48.7% free-throw shooter,
Reed swished the foul shot for a three-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   "The best situation was at the end with Michael Darrett getting
the rebound," he said. "We talked about how everybody was going to
try to rebound and stick their nose in there."</TE>
<TE>   Darrett got the loose ball after Demetrius Jackson missed a
game-tying three-point try with four seconds left. The senior guard
added a free throw, giving the 49ers their third victory in the last
13 games.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach held Pacific (11-6, 3-4) to only two free throws by
Jackson in the final 3:59. Ron Johnson forced Jackson into a tough
shot on the final attempt, while Reed also had a key block and Rudy
Williams added a steal.</TE>

<TE>   Idaho 60, UC Riverside 58--Justin Logan hit a 17-foot jumper as
time expired to give Idaho a Big West victory at UC Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Idaho (6-11, 3-5 Big West) led virtually the entire game and was
up by as many as nine points late in the second half. But UC
Riverside (6-9, 3-3) gradually cut into the deficit, using an 8-1 run
to make it 50-48 with 4:23 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine 109, Portland 88--It took an upset victory over Gonzaga
for Pepperdine to wrestle control of first place in the West Coast
Conference on Friday, but it took a scare for the Waves to finally
put away the conference's worst team on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves erased an inconsistent performance with a dazzling run
in the final eight minutes to secure the victory over Portland before
1,683 at Firestone Fieldhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine (11-6, 4-0) extended its winning streak to six games,
but had to survive a dogged Portland (4-14, 0-4) attack that cut the
lead to 75-72 with 8:20 to play. Five different players scored in a
19-5 run that ended with Cedric Suitt's thunderous slam dunk with
3:52 to play in the game, giving the Waves a 94-77 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Seven Waves finished with double-figure scoring totals, led by
Jimmy Miggins, who had 17, and Glen McGowan and Craig Lewis, who each
had 15.</TE>
<TE>   John Klima</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga 94, Loyola Marymount 60--In an amazing first half, Gonzaga
guard Dan Dickau did what few, if any, basketball players have done
against Loyola Marymount--he single-handedly outscored the Lions.</TE>
<TE>   That proved the beginning of the end for Loyola (9-9, 2-2), which
fell victim to Dickau's long-range shooting and 34 first-half
points--his total for the game--in a West Coast Conference defeat
before 3,342 at Gersten Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Dickau, a senior whose presence in Los Angeles this weekend
attracted such NBA luminaries as Chicago Bulls General Manager Jerry
Krause, tied his own school record by making nine three-point baskets
in staking 13th-ranked Gonzaga (16-3, 3-1) to a 58-32 halftime lead.</TE>

<HD>USC Bounces Back to Upset Sun Devils</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking on ranked teams had not been one of USC's strengths this
season. The Trojans were 1-3 against teams in the Top 25.</LD>
<LD>   But USC had little trouble Saturday overpowering No. 23 Arizona
State to pick up a 68-49 victory before 3,808 at the Sports Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Aisha Hollans had 16 points and was one of four Trojans in double
figures. Ebony Hoffman (13 points, 12 rebounds) and Carmen Krause (10
points, 10 rebounds) had double-doubles.</LD>
<TE>   Melody Johnson led Arizona State with 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   After losing to Arizona on Thursday without starters Tiffany
Elmore (sprained ankle), Hoffman (one-game suspension for fighting)
and Hollans (coach's decision for violating team rules), the Trojans
could not afford another loss and still hope to catch Stanford in the
Pacific 10 Conference standings.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, by holding Arizona State to its lowest point total of the
year, the Trojans (10-8, 6-3) are tied with the Sun Devils for second
place.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question this game was important because we chose to
make a sacrifice [in personnel] the other night," USC Coach Chris
Gobrecht said. "There was a huge sense of urgency."</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils (15-5, 6-3) played one of their poorest games this
season. USC owned the boards (47-36) and held Arizona State to 31.1%
shooting. The most hampered Sun Devil was Amanda Levens, the Pac-10's
leading scorer, who played on a sore ankle. She made only four of 19
shots and had 11 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans looked strong in the first half, building a 28-17
lead. Arizona State scored seven consecutive points to close in,
28-24, at halftime. The Sun Devils got to within two points, but
never caught the Trojans. By the 10:13 mark of the second half, USC
led, 47-35.</TE>

<TE>   Arizona 71, UCLA 60--Aimee Grzyb made five of seven three-point
shots and had 19 points for the Wildcats (9-9, 5-4 in Pac-10 play).
Krista Warren finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds for Arizona,
which won its fourth consecutive conference game.</TE>
<TE>   Whitney Jones had 17 points and Natalie Nakase finished with 10
points and a career-high 11 assists before fouling out for UCLA
(5-12, 2-7), which made 25 of 69 shots (36%).</TE>

<HD>Win Is Twice as Nice for Gibson, Georgia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jim Barrero</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Believe it or not, No. 20 Georgia was actually looking forward to
this trip to Gainesville, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Jarvis Hayes scored 23 points and twin brother Jonas had 13 to
help the Bulldogs upset No. 2 Florida, 84-79, on Saturday, ending the
Gators' school-record 14-game winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   Georgia (15-3, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) got back on the
winning side three days after two players, starting center Steve
Thomas and reserve guard Tony Cole, were suspended while the school
investigates a rape case in which the two were allegedly involved.</LD>
<TE>   "It was good just getting away from Athens, just getting out of
the state of Georgia for a while," Jarvis Hayes said. "The whole
situation there--it's been pretty tough on us."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Gibson, a two-sport star who reneged on an oral commitment to
play football for Florida, made all four of his free throws down the
stretch to help Georgia seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Gators (15-2, 4-1) lost at home for the first time since
Georgia won, 75-72, last season.</TE>
<TE>   "This group of guys has been an unbelievable road team," Georgia
Coach Jim Harrick said. "Mentally, physically and emotionally,
they're very tough guys. Where they go doesn't bother them."</TE>
<TE>   Gibson (13 points) followed a missed free throw by Udonis Haslem
with a thundering, breakaway slam for a 75-67 lead, then the Bulldogs
went nine for 10 from the free-throw line to hang on.</TE>
<TE>   Gibson, a freshman, was set to attend Florida and wanted to play
football and basketball, but said he got a lukewarm response from
Gator basketball Coach Billy Donovan.</TE>
<TE>   That was all Georgia's gain Saturday, especially at the end.</TE>
<TE>   "Fred gave us quickness, energy, enthusiasm and certainly, 13
points," Harrick said. "As a big-time athlete, in a big-time game,
pressure doesn't bother him. He was like a player on the playground."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Diminishing return: Louisville's hiring of Rick Pitino brought
plenty of intrigue to Conference USA, a league that has been
dominated by Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   But when the teams met Saturday in Cincinnati, it was Louisville
assistant Mick Cronin who grabbed some of the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Cronin, who was Coach Bob Huggins' top recruiter at Cincinnati the
last four seasons but left to join Pitino, was loudly jeered when he
walked onto the floor. A sign in the student section read: "Benedict
Cronin."</TE>
<TE>   Huggins was not pleased with Pitino's pursuit of Cronin last
April. Sports Illustrated reported that by the time Pitino called
Huggins to ask permission to interview Cronin, Huggins had heard
about the courtship.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope for Mick's sake he gets that job," Huggins reportedly told
a friend, "because if he doesn't, I'm firing him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Devil driven: The Final Four in January?</TE>
<TE>   That's the way Duke has approached its last four games since a
stunning 77-76 loss to Florida State on Jan. 6.</TE>
<TE>   "We approached this stretch as a Final Four," said Duke's Chris
Duhon after his team routed No. 14 Wake Forest, 103-80. "You play one
great team one night and it takes a lot out of you, then you have to
come back in two days and play again. We handled it well."</TE>
<TE>   Since the loss to the Seminoles, the Blue Devils have defeated
Georgia Tech by 25, North Carolina State by 19, Maryland by 21 and
the Demon Deacons by 23 to secure their hold on the No. 1 ranking.</TE>
<TE>   Wake Forest Coach Skip Prosser certainly noticed Duke's extra
effort.</TE>
<TE>   "They're like an incendiary device, ticking away," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Delivering the goods: Last season as a sophomore, Drew Gooden's
two lowest scoring games were against Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   They also were the only times the 6-foot-10 Kansas forward failed
to score in double figures in the 28 games in which he played.</TE>
<TE>   Now a junior and facing a history he desperately did not want to
repeat, Gooden rearranged his frame of mind.</TE>
<TE>   Gooden scored 15 of his 19 points in the second half and led the
fourth-ranked Jayhawks to a 74-67 victory over No. 5 Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   "I got my mind right," said Gooden, who was limited to one field
goal, two free throws and an air ball in the first half. "I went in
the locker room and I said, 'Man ... I'm not letting this happen
again.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Breaking on through: For Kentucky's Keith Bogans, it had been a
four-game slump.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri's Kareem Rush, some might say, has been in a season slump
unbecoming of a preseason first-team All-American.</TE>
<TE>   Both snapped out of it Saturday, although Rush already had shown
signs of doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Bogans, who had shot 33.3% and averaged only seven points the last
four games, scored 23 to lead No.12 Kentucky to a 72-65 victory
against Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year I probably would have been hiding in a hole," Bogans
said. "If I'm not playing well, I've got to stay focused. That's what
I learned."</TE>
<TE>   Rush, who slumped during much of December, continued a recent
surge, tying his season high with 29 points in No. 21 Missouri's
92-79 victory against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "Early in the season I was tending to force things to try to go
out there and score all my points," Rush said. "When I let the game
come to me, my shots seem to come easier and I'm more open."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Growing pains: Andre Emmett scored 32 points in Texas Tech's 94-70
upset of No. 6 Oklahoma State, but that didn't mean he has grown up
in the eyes of Coach Bob Knight.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're 80, you'll still be waiting for Emmett to mature,"
Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the day: Maurice Riddick of Bethune Cookman came
off the bench to make a school-record 11 three-pointers and score 37
points in a 96-72 victory against Coppin State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the weak: St. Peter's let a seven-point halftime
lead disappear in a 72-65 loss to Niagara as the Peacocks fell to
1-14 after their 13th consecutive loss.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike LaRocco needed nearly seven years, but he finally got his eighth
career supercross victory, overtaking David Vuillemin and winning
Round 3 of the AMA/EA Sports Supercross Series on Saturday at Edison
Field.</LD>
<LD>   LaRocco, 30, last won a 250cc race on April 8, 1995, at Atlanta.
And it looked like he and his Honda might have to wait even longer
the way the night was developing in front of 45,050, a second
consecutive sellout.</LD>
<LD>   The 20-lap main event went back and forth, with Kevin Windham and
Team Suzuki teammate Travis Pastrana running from the pack. But
Pastrana overtook Windham six laps into the race, and Pastrana fell
while racing by himself with nine laps remaining, putting Vuillemin
in position to win for the third time in three races for Team Yamaha.</LD>
<TE>   But La Rocco reeled in Vuillemin, passing him on the final turn of
Lap 16. LaRocco, the Doc Martens team rider from Corona, was followed
to the checkered flag by series leader Vuillemin, third-place
Pastrana and Team Honda's Ricky Carmichael, the defending champion
who has yet to have a top-three finish.</TE>
<TE>   The aura of 16-year-old James "Bubba" Stewart continued to grow in
the 125cc main event. Stewart, a Kawasaki Team rider, was last
heading for Turn 2.</TE>
<TE>   He finished second among 22 riders to Red Bull KTM rider David
Pingree. In three professional races, Stewart has finished second
twice, both at Anaheim, and first at San Diego last week.</TE>
<TE>   "He was going so fast, it was ridiculous," Pingree said of
Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Team Pro Circuit Kawasaki rider Bobby Bonds of Bakersfield was

<LD>After blowing a 20-point lead, UCLA wanted to blow out of Arizona as
soon as possible.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins' flight was not scheduled to leave until 7:40 p.m., and
they rushed from McKale Center to the airport to try to catch an
earlier one. But although they arrived an hour before departure, they
were not allowed on because security did not have enough time to
search their bags.</LD>
<LD>   So it was back to Plan A, and they had to wait four hours until
7:40. That's the price a team pays for not booking charter flights.</LD>
<TE>   "The only consolation is that we can watch the NFL playoff game on
TV at the airport," Bruin guard Ryan Walcott said. "At least we'll
have something to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Walcott, who led Phoenix Shadow Mountain High to a state
championship in 2000, had a dozen relatives at the Arizona State game
Thursday, and eight more at Arizona. They had ample opportunity to
watch the redshirt freshman point guard play: He logged 12 minutes
against the Sun Devils and 14 against the Wildcats--both season
highs--and had only one turnover.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Ryan gives us speed bringing the ball up the floor," UCLA Coach
Steve Lavin said. "He's a good ballhandler."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins' 17 three-point baskets Saturday broke the school
record of 14, set two years ago against Maryland in the NCAA
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UP NEXT</TE>
<TE>   Thursday vs. Stanford, 7:30 p.m., Fox Sports Net--UCLA will return
home to face Stanford and California, which both split with the
Bruins last season. Guard Rico Hines, who sat out against Arizona
State and Arizona because of a concussion, will probably return
Thursday.</TE>

<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Given their travails shooting free throws, who would have thought
that success at the line against Arizona State would be the Trojans'
salvation?</LD>
<LD>   Before the Trojans' trip to the desert, USC was last in the
Pacific 10 Conference in free-throw percentage, making 62.7% of its
shots.</LD>
<LD>   Nursing a three-point lead, the Trojans came up big, making 10 of
11 in the final 54.8 seconds to hold on for an 81-73 victory.</LD>
<TE>   "I think that says a lot," said forward David Bluthenthal, who
made all four of his free throws, which came in the final 25.6
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   USC converted a season-best 84.6% (22 of 26) of its free throws
Saturday to improve to 65.0% for the season.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Bluthenthal, point guard Brandon Granville made all four
of his free throws in the final minute and guard Desmon Farmer made
both of his.</TE>
<TE>   During the crucial final minute, when the Sun Devils were forced
to foul, only forward Sam Clancy missed a free throw, the front end
of a one-and-one with 33.2 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   USC had one field goal in the last five minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Thursday vs. California, 7:30 p.m., Fox Sports Net 2--Before
sweeping the Golden Bears last year, the No. 18 Trojans (14-3, 6-1)

California leads the series, 115-110.</TE>

<DH>Soccer: Beasley scores winning goal with 25 seconds
remaining against South Korea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley, teenagers with the shared dream
of playing in the World Cup this summer, led the United States to its
first soccer victory over South Korea on Saturday, a 2-1 triumph in
front of 42,117 on a chilly afternoon at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   The youngsters, both 19, each scored a goal in the opening-round
CONCACAF Gold Cup match as the Americans defeated one of the teams
they will play in the world championship in June.</LD>
<LD>   Beasley's game-winner came with only 25 seconds left. "Jeff
Cunningham put a great ball over and I saw a little crack [of
daylight] at the near post and I just went for it," said Beasley,
whose left-foot volley flew straight and true. "I was lucky it went
in the goal, so I'm happy."</LD>
<TE>   Not as happy as Bruce Arena, the U.S. coach who saw his team
outplayed in many areas of the field by a Korean side that was much
faster and, seemingly at least, quite a bit fitter.</TE>
<TE>   Even while playing a man down for the final 34 minutes, South
Korea looked the more dangerous team.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a pretty game today, for sure," Arena said. "Korea's a
very difficult team to play against, very physical, very aggressive.
I'm happy there weren't any rules that you couldn't play teenagers,
because we'd be in a lot of trouble."</TE>
<TE>   It was the fifth game between the countries, and the Koreans came
into it holding a 3-0-1 edge.</TE>
<TE>   They might have put themselves in a good position to win had they
been able to take advantage of a penalty kick they were awarded in
the seventh minute.</TE>
<TE>   With 6:35 gone, defender Danny Califf, the Galaxy player making
his national team debut, grabbed Korean forward Choi Yong-Soo's
jersey and yanked him to the turf. Referee Richard Samuel of the
Dominican Republic pointed immediately to the penalty spot.</TE>
<TE>   Yoo Sang-Chul stepped up to take the kick, but drove the ball
straight at goalkeeper Kasey Keller, who bobbled it but hung on.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a ball in the air and it came through and some guy
[Choi] ran through and he was going to be in alone on Kasey, so I did
what I thought I had to do and it ended up working out," Califf said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the locker room at halftime I definitely went up to him
[Keller] and said thanks because he came up huge."</TE>
<TE>   The save loomed even larger in the 35th minute when Donovan
latched onto a crossfield pass from Ante Razov, beat South Korea's
offside trap and lobbed the ball over advancing Korean goalkeeper Lee
Woon-Jae and into the net.</TE>
<TE>   Three minutes later, the score was tied.</TE>
<TE>   With the U.S. defense dropping back and allowing the Koreans more
time than they should have been given, Song Chong-Gug found himself
with the ball at his feet 30 yards from goal.</TE>
<TE>   He unleashed a shot that flew into the upper right corner of the
net, well beyond Keller's outstretched fingers. The goal sparked a
loud celebration from the enthusiastic Korean fans.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea enjoyed more of the play in the second half and
several times caused problems for the American defense. In the 56th
minute, however, Donovan again broke free and was homing in on goal
when he was tackled from behind by Choi Jin-Cheul.</TE>
<TE>   The two crashed to the ground in a tangle of legs and arms and
when order was restored referee Samuel showed Choi the red card,
leaving the Koreans to play out the game with 10 men.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans should have been able to take advantage, but it was
the Asian side that more often seemed in control, just as in the
first 45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they were rather surprised that we took the initiative in
the first half and it was bad luck that we didn't score the penalty
or on one or two other occasions," said Guus Hiddink, South Korea's
Dutch coach.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States [players] had a lot of problems with us, the
way we played. ... The decisive moment was the red card."</TE>
<TE>   Then came Beasley's heroics.</TE>
<TE>   "We were obviously lucky to get a goal right at the end of the
game," Arena acknowledged. "A tie might have been a fairer result."</TE>

<LD>I want to commend you for the article about the portrait of Adele
Bloch-Bauer ("Whose Art Is It Anyway?" by Anne-Marie O'Connor, Dec. 16).
I was fascinated to read about the political climate during World War II,
when the Nazis stole precious jewelry and paintings from the homes of
Jewish families. I have been to Maria Bloch-Bauer Altmann's home many
times because I buy my dresses and suits from her. I have always admired
the copy of the famous painting of her aunt and heard about Altmann's
attempts to get it back. I hope that the article will help her in her
legal case.</LD>

<LD>Thank you for printing the story about John Sheridan ("A Hit Man's
Guilt," by Fred Dickey, Dec. 16). Before Sept. 11, I believed that
everyone was basically good inside. People thought I was being naive, but
I simply called it having faith in humanity. I even thought that
murderers pray for their victims' souls.</LD>
<LD>   But when I woke up to the terrified cries on that September morning,
my whole belief system shattered. Dickey's article allowed me to regain
my beliefs. Although Sheridan's actions were wrong, it was enough for me
that he realized what he had done and had started to repent for it. I
hope people have not given up on the hope that there is good in everyone,
even if it's just a little bit.</LD>

<LD>Walt Disney Concert Hall, with its unexpected angles and curves and
sail-like exterior surfaces soaring in every direction as though to catch
any wind that blows, has beguiled architecture critics and tormented
construction crews. It's already stunning to behold, even only partly
clad in the stainless steel that eventually will sheathe it in reflected
light.</LD>
<LD>   But a question: Are we really going to like this bold and unusual
thing; like it, I mean, in the way you have to like something to live
peaceably with it for many years? Visionary structures originally thought
striking can lose their eye appeal over time and/or come to be viewed
with outright disdain. For example, the TransAmerica Building in San
Francisco, the AT&amp;T Headquarters Building (now the Sony Building) in New
York, the TWA terminal at John F. Kennedy Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Public architecture is the most arrogant of arts. If people dislike a
painting, they can stay away from where it's displayed. If they disdain a
piece of music, they can refrain from attending concerts at which it's
played. A building, however, is unavoidable. It's thrust before us in all
its immensity, and we have little choice but to take it into
consideration, over and over again, as we encounter it in the course of
our lives. It's not as though we can close our eyes while driving or
walking Grand Avenue between 1st and 2nd streets, which the concert hall
occupies.</LD>
<TE>   The people at the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which will call the place
home as of autumn 2003, insist it be referred to as "Walt Disney Concert
Hall," not just "Disney Hall." The latter, says the L.A. Phil's Arvind
Manocha, the new hall's director of strategic operations, "might give
some people the notion that 'The Lion King' is going to move in as soon
as it's finished." Actually, there is something about architect Frank O.
Gehry's $274-million creation that's Disneyesque in the better
sense--something wondrous and reality-defying. But how will such drama
and whimsy play in the workaday context of downtown, a perp walk from the
Criminal Courts Building (not exactly the Happiest Place on Earth)?</TE>
<TE>   Critics are confident it will wear well. Architecture writer Michael
Webb says people tend to embrace buildings as they grow used to them. A
decade ago, he says, the design of the hall was seen as "strange and a
bit frightening," but by now the structure has "gone through its period
of acceptance." Critic Joseph Giovannini believes the hall will remain
interesting, like the dramatic 28-year-old seaside Opera House in Sydney,
Australia, because "it has life inherent in its forms. You have to walk
around it and as you do, it de-forms and re-forms. It sets you in motion
because it seems to be in motion itself."  Manocha takes heart from other
Gehry buildings, such as the 4-year-old Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao,
Spain, that also are defined by curves and metal. "I have no worries
about [the concert hall] dating badly," he says. "I look at Bilbao and
the other buildings, and they're withstanding the test of time. This is
the medium in which he's working. In time we'll come to see they're just
another type of building, much like the Mies van der Rohe buildings came
to be seen as just a different way of doing skyscrapers."</TE>
<TE>   Manocha believes people's use of the building ultimately will
determine their regard for it. Some will know the hall as the place where
they listen to Sibelius in a 2,273-seat auditorim. Others will experience
it strolling through its public gardens in the afternoon or lunching in
its street-side restaurant. Still others will park their cars in the
county-owned parking garage beneath the hall while serving on jury duty
(they'll emerge from underground into the lobby). "People who are afraid
of the idea of a concert hall and symphonic music will be engaging the
building," Manocha says. "It will overcome whatever daunting thought they
have about entering a palace of high art."</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra's No. 1 priority from the start was that the hall sound
good. Gehry, Manocha says, got the commission in 1988 because he most
keenly grasped that a concert hall, unlike a museum or office building,
is really a musical instrument. Nor was the hall conceived as an "event
building," meant to catalyze redevelopment of the surrounding area. In
1988 there wasn't much talk about transforming L.A.'s humdrum Civic
Center into a psychic anchor for the whole fragmented metropolis.</TE>
<TE>   There is now, though. A proposal unveiled a year ago envisions a large
central park sweeping unimpeded down Grand Avenue to the renovated City
Hall. Crowning it would be a tiara of cultural institutions, including
the Museum of Contemporary Art, the concert hall, a reconstructed Music
Center and the new Our Lady of the Angels Cathedral, with the concert
hall as crown jewel. With luck, Gehry's phantasm on the hill will live up
to our ambitious expectations, both those it was always meant to meet and
those we've more recently foisted on it.</TE>

<LD>Burbank resident Joey D'Auria has just finished a 17-year stint on
"The Bozo Show," donning the red wig, oversize shoes and red  nose of the
famed clown for WGN-TV in Chicago and grabbing five Emmy awards. He
played Bozo from 1984 until August last year, when the final show aired.
We caught D'Auria in his first return gig, playing Stepan Stepanovitch
Chubukov in Anton Chekhov's "The Proposal" in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Do you see parallels between doing Bozo and Chekhov? No.</LD>
<LD>   OK, then, what's the biggest difference?</LD>
<TE>   I don't wear a yak wig when I do Chekhov. Bozo's hair was made from a
Tibetan yak.</TE>
<TE>   How has L.A. changed since your Bozo years?</TE>
<TE>   All the executives are younger. [Back in the '70s and '80s] I was
living in Beverly Hills, paying $150 a month for rent. In the late '70s,
Chuck Barris was looking for acts for "The Gong Show." I created a bunch
of characters. The most popular was "Dr. Flame-O," a three-minute bit
where I waved my hands over seven candles while howling the song "Smoke
Gets in Your Eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Why candles?</TE>
<TE>   It was the '70s. Everyone had lots of candles.</TE>
<TE>   Other "Gong Show" standouts?</TE>
<TE>   I came on once as Professor Franz Von Bimbo, beating a rocking chair
into splinters to the "William Tell Overture."</TE>
<TE>   Why were you the last Bozo off the bus?</TE>
<TE>   I didn't even audition! My wife, Virginia, saw an article in the
Christian Science Monitor, so I phoned and sent a tape of my New Year's
Eve appearance on "The Tonight Show" as "Dr. Flame-O." They flew me in to
audition.</TE>
<TE>   Did the Bozo character intersect with your own?</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago I played Max Prince in "Laughter on the 23rd Floor,"
[inspired by] Sid Caesar in "Your Show of Shows." Max was demented and
intense. Friends told me it was similar to how Bozo was backstage. My
wife said there was a thin line between Bozo and me, and it got erased
over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Bozo must have had rambunctious young audience members.</TE>
<TE>   There are always packs of [Cub] Scouts. Dogs are delightful, until
they're in packs.</TE>
<TE>   Can you divulge the best pie-in-the-face recipe?</TE>
<TE>   Shaving cream. Whipped cream is oily and eventually curdles into
cheese. And remember: Never use menthol!</TE>
<TE>   What would Bozo say about Stepan Stepanovitch Chubukov?</TE>
<TE>   [Bozo voice]: Funny name!</TE>

<LD>They come from around the globe to the Orbit Hotel, a groovy hostel
amid the funky boutiques on Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood. Open nearly
two years, the 32-room former retirement home, refurbished in '60s mod
decor, lures international hipsters with clean, affordable rooms (rates
start at $17) and its proximity to the Sunset Strip and Hollywood. We
dropped by on a recent Wednesday morning.</LD>

<LD>Jenny Gia-Briggs admits to having a love-hate relationship with
Bakersfield. "It's typical of natives," says the 34-year-old elementary
school teacher. "I used to just complain and complain. My husband said,
'Stop complaining. Do something about it.' " So she did.</LD>
<LD>   A little over a year ago she founded BAMS, the Bakersfield Alternative
Movie Society, screening campy B movies on her garage door and then at a
local cafe, now closed. And in October, she put out the first issue of
the Blackboard, a free alternative monthly named after a historic
Bakersfield honky-tonk destroyed last year by the wrecking ball. Topics
covered so far include masked wrestling at the city's Dome Arena, the
jungle-themed artwork at Palms Sub-Bourbon Liquors and the life of a
local dominatrix.</LD>
<LD>   Gia-Briggs got the idea to publish after visiting Portland, Maine,
last summer. "There are only about 60,000 people there and they have this
great little alternative news weekly," she says. "Bakersfield has a
quarter million. It was one of those lightbulb moments." Besides, she
adds, "I was going to be a journalist for a long time. Instead I picked
the other low-paying profession--teaching."</LD>
<TE>   A half dozen or so writers contribute to the Blackboard, and
Gia-Briggs writes under two pseudonyms. She does the layout herself on a
personal computer and spends about $150 each month to print several
thousand copies, which are distributed at local bookstores, tattoo shops,
restaurants and libraries. She even left a small stack on the doorstep of
the big local daily, the Bakersfield Californian.</TE>
<TE>   Does she worry that exposing the city's hip side could make
Bakersfield the next Silver Lake? Not at all. "Tell all the hipsters to
come to Bakersfield to stay," Gia-Briggs says. "It's dirt cheap to live
here. In pollution we're second to Los Angeles, so you'll live a couple
more months."</TE>

<LD>Nellie Oleson a fashion muse? With her prim petticoats and rigid
ringlets, "Little House on the Prairie's" spoiled minx may not be an
obvious style icon, but for Cornell Collins, Laura Ingalls' nemesis has
been sweet inspiration.</LD>
<LD>   The Long Beach-based designer's penchant for unconventional
influences, meticulous detailing and fine fabrics has drawn notice for a
couple of seasons, but things reached critical mass after the
27-year-old's "Prairie"-themed spring 2002 collection hit the runway
during L.A. Fashion Week in November.</LD>
<LD>   Since then Collins, who was working a day job and designing at night,
has created a million-dollar dress of casino chips worn by fashionista
Paris Hilton to the Palms Casino Resort opening in Las Vegas and fielded
orders from high-end boutiques such as A. Mason in Santa Monica and Los
Angeles and Boulevard in Hong Kong.</LD>
<TE>   Born in North Carolina, Collins moved to L.A. right out of high school
in 1993, attending the Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising and
graduating from Brooks College. After assisting women's wear designer
Antonio Garcia, Collins debuted what he calls a "very bourgeoisie" fall
2000 collection. His fall 2001 collection, however, was inspired by
Edwardian freak shows and the Bauhaus. By the time he showed his
"Prairie"-based spring 2002 collection during New York's Fashion Week,
Collins was generating a buzz. "I've felt like this is happening faster
than I can keep up with, but I know how much went into it," he says of
his "sudden" success.</TE>
<TE>   Collins knows that his pricey, avant-garde pieces don't fit in with
the casual aesthetic that epitomizes Southern California. "My sensibility
is very dressed up and very European," says the designer, who's keeping
mum about his next collection. "Things could've happened faster, but it
would have meant compromising and I'll never do that," he says--a pioneer
spirit worthy of the prairie.</TE>

<HD>Butterfly's Hard Landing</HD>
<DH>Everyone talks about saving the world, but how many are willing to
risk everything--comfort, career, even life itself--while trying? In this
special issue, we bring you the stories of four people whose individual
efforts on behalf of their causes have required extraordinary
determination and personal sacrifice. Whether you agree with them or not,
it's hard not to be inspired by the passion, compassion and commitment of
those rallying to the cry on activist Julia Butterfly Hill's favorite
shirt . . .</DH>
<DH>She Lived for Two Years on a Rickety, Weather-Beaten Platform Near
the Top of a 200-Foot California Redwood. Then, Says Julia  Butterfly
Hill, Things Got Weird.</DH>

<AU>MATTHEW HELLER</AU>
<BD>Matthew Heller last wrote for the magazine about the transporting
of radioactive nuclear waste along California 127</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On this balmy October evening, some 400 well-heeled Angelenos have
gathered in the auditorium of the Freud Playhouse at UCLA. They have paid
up to $500 a ticket to attend a fund-raiser for the Ark Trust
animal-protection group. Their ranks include stars such as Lindsey "The
Bionic Woman" Wagner and Gillian Anderson of "The X-Files."</LD>
<LD>   Gloria Steinem is hosting the event, billed as "An Evening of Music
and Inspiration." Later, she will introduce singer Sophie B. Hawkins, who
also is an animal-rights activist. But the first special guest will
provide the inspiration. "No one is better proof of the power of one and
the power of example," Steinem says.</LD>
<LD>   From stage right emerges a slim, lanky woman in black slacks, bare
feet and a purple T-shirt bearing the message "Do Something." She bows
toward Steinem and faces the audience, the curtain behind her now covered
in the projected image of a dense, murky forest. She is Julia Butterfly
Hill--the eco-bionic woman who took Butterfly as her forest name and
survived for two years atop a Northern California redwood called Luna.
The audience gives her a standing ovation.</LD>
<TE>   For the next 45 minutes, Hill paces the stage, a radio microphone
attached to her waist, and delivers a bravura combination of performance
art and pep talk, her husky voice oscillating in sermon-like cadences.
She remembers her first visit to a redwood forest--"The air was so pure
it tasted sweet on my tongue." She describes sitting in Luna as loggers
felled nearby redwoods. With ear-piercing wails, tears in her eyes, her
body contorted, she evokes the sound of a chain saw slashing, of a
redwood plunging to the forest floor.</TE>
<TE>   Still bursting with energy and passion, her audience captivated, Hill
concludes by exhorting them to follow her example in some way, to realize
that life is "interconnected" and that the "power of one" has a ripple
effect that can create change. "Love in action has the answer," she
proclaims before receiving another standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't an act," she tells me later. "This is me, this is
everything I care about."</TE>
<TE>   Two years after Hill completed her epic vigil in Luna, saving it from
the loggers, she is big box office, an environmental movement messenger
whom some have compared to Joan of Arc and Rosa Parks. At speaking
engagements across the country, she draws packed crowds.</TE>
<TE>   Branching away from forest-protection issues, she has embraced
everything from animal rights to the campaign to free Native American
activist Leonard Peltier, who is in prison for murdering two FBI agents.
She has helped inspire others, including an Arkansas grandmother, to do
their own tree-sits. "She's an inspirational character," says John Knox,
co-executive director of Earth Island Institute, a leading environmental
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Hill is marketed and merchandised. On their way into the Freud
theater, audience members filed past a table displaying an array of
Butterfly products, including copies of her memoir, "The Legacy of Luna,"
and two videos about the tree-sit, "Butterfly" and "Luna: The Stafford
Giant Treesit." There also are Butterfly note cards and T-shirts. One
T-shirt carries a message from Julia: "We arise beautiful and free." Some
of the proceeds go to her nonprofit Circle of Life Foundation, which
promotes efforts to protect and restore the Earth.</TE>
<TE>   But some activists believe Hill has lost her way in the treacherous
forest of celebrity. The down-home Julia of the tree-sit, they say, has
metamorphosed into Julia Butterfly Inc., an example of the corporate
machinery she once battled. They claim she has distanced herself from her
tree-sit supporters and failed to articulate a cohesive message,
preferring feel-good platitudes to thorough analysis of conservation
issues. "She got famous, and her activism went out of her heart and into
her mind," complains Darryl Cherney, a veteran organizer for the radical
Earth First! group. "She started talking about respect and love instead
of the forests."</TE>
<TE>   With the recent death of David Brower, a Nobel Prize nominee and key
figure in the development of the Sierra Club, Hill, who divides her time
between friends' homes in Humboldt County and the Bay Area, is America's
most famous environmentalist. Now she may be facing an even stiffer test
than surviving in a redwood for two years. "She did well in the tree
because she wanted to be alone and felt personally comfortable being
alone," says Doug Wolens, a San Francisco filmmaker who shot the
"Butterfly" video. "Since coming down, she doesn't have the ability" to
tune things out.</TE>
<TE>   I meet with Hill at her Westwood hotel a few hours before the UCLA
appearance. She had flown from Oakland with her manager, concert promoter
Paul Bassis, and a representative of Circle of Life. She is smarter than
she was during her days in Luna. The grunge look she affected
then--personal grooming, no doubt, being difficult 180 feet up a
redwood--is long gone. Her dark hair, with a few incongruous streaks of
gray, is parted in the center. Her T-shirt, she says, is made of organic
cotton. She clutches a stainless steel mug that she takes everywhere with
her. "I refuse to use disposable anything," she explains.</TE>
<TE>   There are still some rough edges. Her sentences tend to meander and,
as the words pour out, she occasionally misspeaks--"people of conscious"
instead of "people of conscience"; "building the GPA in our economy," an
apparent allusion to the GNP. It's also clear that she's not altogether
comfortable with her lofty status. Yes, she acknowledges, her high
profile furthers her activist causes through the media attention her fame
attracts. But she talks about what she calls "celebrititis"--"a disease
of our consciousness" that isolates the famous from the public--and
insists she never sought the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   "I was always the woman in the corner of the cafe watching other
people," Hill says. "To be thrust out into the limelight is really
difficult."</TE>
<TE>   When Hill climbed into Luna on Dec. 10, 1997, two months shy of her
24th birthday, she was an unknown, a stranger even to the Northern
California forest activists who had been staging intermittent tree-sits
in the redwoods for a decade. The daughter of an itinerant Arkansas
preacher, she had grown up in poverty, wearing hand-me-downs and never
knowing where her next meal would come from. After doing a bit of
modeling, she studied business and art at Arkansas State University but
left after two years to start a restaurant with her father, who had given
up the ministry. After the restaurant failed, she moved to Fayetteville,
Ark., to make money so that she could travel.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in August 1996, Hill suffered brain damage in a car accident,
the impact driving her right eye into her skull. While recuperating, she
resolved to change her life, to "visit the places that had deep spiritual
roots." In June 1997, she traveled to Northern California and hiked into
a redwood forest. She walked out, so her memoir says, "a different
woman."</TE>
<TE>   That fall, having sold almost everything she owned in Arkansas, Hill
returned to redwood country hoping to connect with forest activists. She
wasn't too impressed. A rally in Eureka struck her as disorganized; at a
base camp for tree-sitters she "sat around a lot, looking for some way to
become involved." Finally, an Earth First! activist showed up at the camp
looking for someone to sit in Luna.</TE>
<TE>   The 200-foot old-growth redwood stood on a steep slope above the small
Humboldt County town of Stafford. A year earlier, torrents of mud had
slid down the slope into the town, a disaster that some residents blamed
on the clear-cutting logging practices of Pacific Lumber Co. They tried
to gather support to sue the company, a unit of Maxxam Corp. and the
area's dominant business. But Pacific Lumber carried on clear-cutting and
marked Luna for the chain saw. The tree got its name because the moon was
full when activists hiked out with materials for the tree-sit.</TE>
<TE>   Hill's new home was a rickety platform 20 feet below Luna's topmost
branch. She did not expect to stay that long. The tree-sitting record
stood at 90 days, and she certainly didn't plan to break it. But Hill
would spend the next 738 days on her lofty perch, surviving everything
the harsh weather and Pacific Lumber could throw at her. The company's
tactics included buzzing her with helicopters, making the platform sway
in the propeller draft, and depriving her of sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, stories appeared in the Los Angeles Times, Time and People.
In "The Legacy of Luna," Hill says she viewed the publicity with alarm,
her inclination being to "climb down and get far away." But by the 100th
day of the tree-sit, she was courting the media, assisted by Robert
Parker, a forest activist. "They worked it really hard," recalls Wolens.
"That's what got the media. They had a plan."</TE>
<TE>   Attractive and armed with a cell phone, Hill made an alluring and
articulate spokesperson, one whose bond with the tree seemed to symbolize
the potential for a more respectful relationship between humans and
nature.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't simply articulate a narrow political agenda," says Herb
Schwartz, a Garberville attorney who provided logistical support for
Hill's tree-sit. "It was poetic."</TE>
<TE>   According to Darryl Cherney, he and other members of Earth First!
thought "the goddess had sent a messenger . . . You could get high
talking to her on the phone." More than a few activists developed a crush
on the former model, who, with her 5-foot-10-inch frame, full lips, rosy
cheeks and hair cascading below her shoulders, looked like she'd walked
out of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." Cherney says Earth First! also
"worked hard to promote Julia," seeing her as a national spokesperson for
its conservation cause.</TE>
<TE>   The publicity not only raised public awareness of the plight of
old-growth redwoods but also exerted pressure on Pacific Lumber to reach
a settlement with Hill. After protracted negotiations, the company agreed
not to cut Luna, allow Hill permanent visitation rights to the tree and
create a buffer zone; Hill's supporters paid the company $50,000, roughly
the value of an old-growth tree once felled.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 18, 1999, Hill climbed down from the tree and headed for New
York to do the morning news shows. "I guess I'm the queen of jumping in
at the deep end," Hill says. "The press was going to cover the story
whether I was there or not . . . I had to go and say, 'Yes, we had a
victory but there's still a lot of work to be done in this world.' "</TE>
<TE>   By this time, Hill had parted company with Parker, making Bassis, who
runs a company called People Productions, her manager. The
public-speaking invitations came pouring in from organizations hoping to
have her glow wash over their cause. The environmental movement has had
its stars--Brower, John Muir, Edward Abbey, Rachel Carson, to name a
few--but none quite like Julia Butterfly Hill. She was, the San Francisco
Examiner announced, "a global celebrity able to command more reportorial
microphones and telephones and cameras than any other living
environmentalist."</TE>
<TE>   But among some in the movement, there has been a Butterfly backlash.</TE>
<TE>   "Within the ranks of longtime Northern California activists, Hill
faces criticism of being a 'corporate sellout' and 'self-promoter,' " the
Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported in August 2000. "She is accused of
relying on a professional manager and attorneys to manage her new career.
And she is criticized for ignoring the cadre of activists who helped her
stage [the Luna] protest." Cherney was quoted as saying: "Frankly, I
think she enjoys the cult that's building up around her."</TE>
<TE>   More than a year later, Cherney, who, along with fellow Earth First!
member Judi Bari was seriously injured by a mysterious car bomb in 1990,
still isn't too thrilled about Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "[She] dissed many of the people without whom that tree-sit would not
have been successful, and in a way that only seems to make her less
effective," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Outside observers also have noticed a shift. "She seems to have moved
over more to the mainstream conservation groups," says John Campbell,
chairman of Pacific Lumber. "She seems to be outcast by the more radical
groups."</TE>
<TE>   The backlash is somewhat predictable, says David Harris, author of
"The Last Stand: The War Between Wall Street and Main Street over
California's Ancient Redwoods." Northern California activists, he notes,
are a fractious bunch and Earth First! tends to be "sensitive to the
issue of celebrity, the tendency to pick one person and say, 'That's it.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Cherney also has been accused on occasion of grabbing too much of the
limelight.</TE>
<TE>   Some hard-core activists objected to Hill's agreement to save Luna,
seeing any payment to Pacific Lumber as a betrayal. In March 2000, three
months after concluding the tree-sit, Hill was interrupted by protests
against the deal while making the keynote address to an environmental law
conference at the University of Oregon. Two masked men and a woman
marched through the university ballroom, their chests bared to reveal
scrawled messages. One said simply: "Julia Sells Out." After Hill resumed
her speech, another woman from the audience, this one fully clothed,
climbed onto the stage and launched into a 15-minute harangue.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want to know is the truth," the heckler raged. "Tell us now.
Why did you give money to the corporation?"</TE>
<TE>   Hill stood at the podium in tears before eventually finishing her
speech.</TE>
<TE>   "The Legacy of Luna," published in April 2000 (on paper made from
post-consumer recycled fibers and processed with chlorine-free bleach),
is a particularly sore point. For one thing, Hill chose publisher
HarperSanFrancisco, an imprint of HarperCollins, which is controlled by
media behemoth Rupert Murdoch, whom some activists see as the
personification of corporate greed. She says she labored over the
decision but relented because she wanted to reach people "who never read
a book like this."</TE>
<TE>   But she also doesn't exactly paint a rosy picture in the book of Earth
First!, accusing the group of wanting to bring her out of the tree during
the first winter. In one passage, she relates a conversation with an
activist who was visiting her in the tree. "I don't feel an allegiance to
whatever the heck Earth First! is," she quotes herself, later adding: "If
I had bowed to Earth First!'s wishes, Luna would have been cut in two
seconds flat." Cherney insists that Earth First! had legitimate concerns
about her safety in the tree but "never decided that Julia should come
down."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Parker, who has worked with Earth First!, gave the book a
damning review, calling it "a great disappointment" that provided "a
mostly dry account of day-to-day life in the tree mixed with meandering
philosophy." By failing to acknowledge the "massive community effort"
that supported the tree-sit, he wrote, Hill had perpetuated "the public's
romantic perception that the tree-sit was the action of a lone
individual."</TE>
<TE>   Hill has remained active on forest issues. She traveled to her home
state and met with Mary Lightheart, a Fayetteville grandmother who had
staged a tree-sit in a post oak that was to be cut to make room for a
department store. Last July, she was arrested near Chicago, along with
singer Bonnie Raitt and 18 other activists, for trespassing at the
headquarters of timber giant Boise Cascade's office-products division.
They were protesting the company's logging practices. Hill also attended
Maxxam's last annual general meeting in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   But some believe that by taking on the world--she also espouses the
cause of convicted murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal--Hill is losing touch with
the forest, her efforts increasingly divorced from the local level at
which activists can effect real change. In Northern California, her
critics note, clear-cutting and the logging of old-growth redwoods
continue unabated. Says Parker: "Acting as what essentially amounts to a
rent-a-poster-child for the issue of the month serves little to further
the serious efforts of grass-roots activists, if not indeed hindering
them."</TE>
<TE>   According to attorney Herb Schwartz, Hill has not articulated a
"transcendent" message as she did in Luna. "She essentially is like a
butterfly who flew from a tree and still hasn't landed," he says. "In a
sense that's OK. She needs to explore the world and find out where her
energies would be best used. But she's ringing some false notes."
Schwartz would like to see her focus less on the anti-disposable
lifestyle and more on the complex issues involved in forest protection.</TE>
<TE>   Hill, in a sense, has become marginalized, he says. "She's allowed
herself to be pushed out to the edge" of the dialogue about the forest.
"If she'd engaged in that dialogue, I don't think anybody would accuse
her of selling out."</TE>
<TE>   The criticisms evoke a mixed response from Hill. On the one hand, she
tries to remain stoic. "In the world of activism, for every action there
is an equal and opposite criticism, period," she says. "I would go crazy
trying to please everybody." She also advises her critics to "take a real
hard look at the history of the activist movement. We have a pattern . .
. of putting people up on pedestals in order to tear them down."</TE>
<TE>   But when I ask Hill specifically about whether she "dissed" Earth
First!, the emotion and the pain come through. "I won't talk about it
because I refuse to stoop to their level," she says, her eyes filling
with tears. "I won't do it." Then she adds: "They can say whatever they
want and I'm going to keep sending them love anyway. And I'm going to
keep doing what I do . . . because I wake up in the morning [asking
myself], 'What can I do today, how can I help the world today?'</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to make some people hate me, it's going to frustrate other
people. But I can't change what I do because I believe in what I do
beyond a shadow of a doubt."</TE>
<TE>   There is no mistaking the authenticity behind the words. At the very
least, Hill is a counterpoint to the apathy so often ascribed to those of
her generation, taking on a huge responsibility at an age when many in
her generation don't even vote, let alone stand up for conservation. "I
can't believe that after living in a tree for two years without touching
the ground," she says with a sigh, "it's [still] not enough for people."</TE>
<TE>   She also genuinely believes, as a result of her experience in the
tree, that things are "interconnected," that "talking about the web of
life is not a philosophy or a theology but an actuality. So my work is
about making those connections [between different issues], helping people
understand . . . how if we affect one thing negatively it ripples out and
affects the world."</TE>
<TE>   John Knox of the Earth Island Institute endorses her approach. "She
has a sophisticated view of the big agenda for social issues," he says.
"It's about social justice." Agrees filmmaker Doug Wolens: "While the
message might be slightly different, it's about the same values."</TE>
<TE>   Hill has delivered her message in another book, to be published by
HarperSanFrancisco this spring and titled, "One Makes the Difference."</TE>
<TE>   "It's stories of individuals who've made a difference," she explains,
a primer "on everything from how to 'green' your home to how to write a
letter to your congressman."</TE>
<TE>   She's also been negotiating a deal to make "The Legacy of Luna" into a
movie.</TE>
<TE>   As for Luna, the tree suffered a near-fatal blow in November 2000 when
an unidentified vandal with a chain saw carved a 32-inch-deep gash into
its trunk. Arborists performed emergency surgery, inserting braces that
saved the tree. Hill's initial reaction to the cutting of Luna was one of
horror and grief.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt as if I had been kicked in my stomach and all the air sucked
out of me," she recalls in her first book.</TE>
<TE>   But a few days later, she expressed almost a sense of relief in a
conversation with Wolens, the ambivalence toward her celebrity oozing out
like sap. "If it falls in the next week, the next month or in 10 years,
people will get the idea that it's not about me, that I didn't save a
thing," she told her friend, apparently groping for a way to deflate the
public's romantic perceptions about her.</TE>
<TE>   For Wolens, the comment was "so Julia." It was as if, he says, the
vandalism had helped her "come to terms with people looking at her as a
hero. She doesn't want to be a hero."</TE>

<DH>Three Years Ago, Rob Reiner Put Hollywood on a Back Burner and
Plunged  Into State Politics, Pushing an Initiative to Help Preschool
Children. Turns Out the Director of 'Spinal Tap' Is a Bit of a Wonk.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of the California Children and Families Commission was
playing tour guide. Proud as a new father, he crisscrossed Los Angeles
County, showing off programs that receive money from a state tax on
tobacco products.</LD>
<LD>   He stopped at a Pacoima day-care center, where workers were learning
how to enrich their program with an early literacy curriculum for
toddlers. He visited an apartment in Long Beach, where a home health-care
worker helped a recovered drug addict reconnect with her baby girl, who
had been in foster care. In Cudahy, he stopped at the Elizabeth Learning
Center, a pre-K to 12 school with a family medical clinic, day care and
an adult education center on its campus. He strode across the blacktop,
past beige bungalows, past the cafeteria and the aroma of steamed green
beans, and stopped at the health clinic, where a prenatal class was in
session.</LD>
<LD>   "We're talking about body changes," the instructor said. Then she
interrupted the lecture to ask this bearded, bearish man for an
autograph. "My kids won't believe I met Meathead today," she exclaimed.</LD>
<TE>   It isn't the most flattering epithet to trail a man for a
quarter-century. But Rob Reiner isn't bothered by his association with
the character Archie Bunker disparaged on the 1970s sitcom "All in the
Family." A liberal foil to the bigoted Bunker, the role not only launched
Reiner's career but allowed him to voice many of the views he shared with
his on-screen alter ego. Both, for instance, believed that government
should move more aggressively to correct social ills. But while
Meathead's rants are consigned to rerun history, Reiner has taken his act
to the real world. He no longer merely talks about government. He is
government.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999 he has held an unpaid position chairing a state commission
dedicated to helping young children. He's also now much wiser about what
happens when an individual determined to ease social problems meets the
reality of a government bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   Reiner's role in California government began when he led the 1998
campaign for Proposition 10, a state ballot initiative calling for a
50-cent tax on tobacco products to be used to help preschool children.
The measure passed, and soon he found himself appointed to the commission
charged with overseeing the money. Since then, the director of "The
Princess Bride," "When Harry Met Sally," "Misery" and "The American
President" has stepped behind the camera only to produce educational
videos for new parents. "Movies may affect people's lives," the
54-year-old director says, explaining the new priorities in his life.
"But they don't have the long-lasting, profound effect of a home-visit
program."</TE>
<TE>   Reiner's interest in a child's early development dates back more than
20 years to when his sister, Annie, a psychoanalyst, encouraged him to
examine his formative years in analysis. After completing therapy, he
wondered about the upbringing of kids who turned up on the 11 o'clock
news as criminals. "You always see the same report," he says. " 'He was a
nice kid, so polite, I can't believe he would . . . .' I thought,
'Something's missing here.' " But it would be several more years before
his interest led to action. In 1994, he asked his assistant to call the
office of Tipper Gore, wife of then Vice President Al Gore. "I called her
out of the blue, I had no idea what I was doing," says Reiner, sitting in
the Beverly Hills offices of Castle Rock Entertainment, the production
company he co-founded 14 years earlier. "They ask me, 'What is it
regarding?' "</TE>
<TE>   Tipper Gore knew Reiner as a celebrity and reliable contributor to the
Democratic Party, but she knew nothing of his interest in early childhood
development. The two met, and soon Reiner was in touch with a network of
experts. He also read the Carnegie Corp.'s "Starting Points" report,
which summarized new findings about how an inadequate environment between
birth and age 3 can compromise a child's brain development, and about the
costs to society of ignoring that truth.</TE>
<TE>   The report, however, had drawn little attention. "It occurred to me:
all this great information and nobody knows about it," Reiner says. "OK,
there's my role: I'm a communicator." Inspired, he and his wife, Michele,
a photographer, started the I Am Your Child foundation to spread the
word. (Michele Reiner has joked that they had their daughter, now 4, to
apply what they had learned. The couple's sons are 10 and 8.) Reiner
produced a TV special on brain development and successfully lobbied the
White House for a conference on the topic.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, former state Assemblyman Mike Roos of L.A. saw Reiner address
the National Governors Assn. and approached him with the idea for Prop.
10, which they jointly introduced. It was an ambitious measure. The
initiative sought to provide for the physical, mental, emotional and
developmental needs of the 500,000 children born in California annually.
Proponents believe that if those needs are met in the first five years of
life, children will be better prepared for school, which pays off not
only by giving them better educational and work opportunities but also by
diminishing the chance they will turn to crime, drug abuse or domestic
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Reiner felt confident. He had steeped himself in the literature of
early childhood, and tapped experts in the field. Many of them, including
Harvard emeritus professor of pediatrics T. Berry Brazelton, praise his
grasp of the subject. "I saw how much he learned in order to push this
through," Brazelton says. "I really didn't expect anything like it."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, found the expectations unrealistic, as well as
unscientific. "It's not as if early childhood isn't important. It is,"
says John Bruer, author of "The Myth of the First Three Years" and
president of the James S. McDonnel Foundation, which funds research in
brain science and education. "But it's really unfortunate that thinking
about how we should spend resources for young children can go on, and
really ignore or misrepresent early childhood development. For very
commendable reasons, people think we should do more for children, but to
do it they've created a scientific fiction.</TE>
<TE>   "Brain science has nothing to say about what happens to babies' brains
when parents read to them," Bruer continues. "There's nothing wrong with
reading, but in other cultures they're not as concerned with it as we
are. We have to be careful in our attempts to use biology to justify our
values. Human children thrive under a great variety of social and
cultural conditions. Yes, kids should be ready to read when they start
school. But starting at age 7 is not a biological constraint."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, research does show a lot about the irreversible
effects of negative environments during the early years. Those who are
most vulnerable--the children of drug addicts and alcoholics, the victims
and witnesses of abuse, those born prematurely or with disabilities--are
the most affected.</TE>
<TE>   Pediatrician Robert Ross, who sat on the Prop. 10 state commission for
a time, remembers talking to Reiner about making the leap from scientific
theory to public policy. "Watching someone who is not from the public
sector or professionally trained in early childhood, it was amazing to
see how quickly Rob understood the system, and what it would take to
improve it."</TE>
<TE>   Pairing funding for children with a tax on tobacco may be the most
legislatively elegant facet of Prop. 10. California had already
established itself as hostile both to the tobacco industry--and to
smokers. And who could argue with giving money to help kids?</TE>
<TE>   But it is that source of funding that continues to rile critics. "They
were basically saying [to voters]: 'Don't worry, smokers will pay for
this, it won't cost you,' " says Jacob Sullum, author of "For Your Own
Good: The Anti-Smoking Crusade and the Tyranny of Public Health." "It
relieves the burden of having to make the case to the public. If they had
to pick up the tab, people would have been a lot more skeptical. In this
case people could feel, 'We're not paying for this, who cares what it
costs?' "</TE>
<TE>   Even Prop. 10's most ardent supporters acknowledge that because the
law's goals are framed in terms of school readiness, the effects can't be
seen for some time, at least until babies born during the Prop. 10 era
start kindergarten. "I think you're not going to really know for 10 or 15
years, when you see lower teen pregnancy rates, lower crime rates and
lower remedial educational costs," Reiner says.</TE>
<TE>    If Reiner were an enthusiastic student of government, he might be
perversely grateful for the education he received starting the day he
decided to push Prop 10. By then, his child advocacy Rolodex had grown
nearly as full as his Hollywood one. When he began flipping through both
for money and support, he found a remarkable range of help.</TE>
<TE>   Helen Mendel of the American Cancer Society recalls a dinner at Il
Cielo restaurant that drew members of her organization, the Heart Assn.,
several of Reiner's like-minded liberal actor pals, as well as Arianna
Huffington and conservatives Charlton Heston and Pat Boone. Reiner and
his father, writer-director Carl Reiner, each put up $2 million of their
own money.</TE>
<TE>   Early polls predicted that 70% of voters favored Prop. 10. Then the
tobacco industry juiced up its ad budget and began going after Reiner
personally, asking voters if they wanted him, this creation of Hollywood,
to raise their children. "I don't think Rob really realized when he got
involved with a tobacco issue how they did things," says Alan Henderson,
a professor of public health at Cal State Long Beach who wrote the ballot
language endorsing Prop. 10 for the voter handbook. "The attacks on him
were relentless."</TE>
<TE>   Support for the proposition began to slip, and then to fall. By the
time the campaign entered its last month, Reiner was fearful of losing,
exhausted, and discouraged by the beating he was taking in the ads. Then
Al Gore got involved and, as the former vice president remembers, "did
everything I could do to help him pass it." Reiner was overjoyed by
Gore's help. But the initiative was still in trouble. On Election Day,
returns late into the night showed the measure failing. "It was horrible.
Horrible!" Reiner remembers. But early in the morning, the tide turned.
By 3 a.m., the "yes" votes held a narrow lead. It was only two weeks
later, after absentee ballots had been counted, that Reiner could finally
exhale. Prop. 10 passed by less than half a percentage point. Still, the
battle wasn't over.</TE>
<TE>   Four months later, the owners of a cigarette retail chain put Prop. 28
on the ballot, seeking to repeal the Prop. 10 tax. This time, however,
72% of voters endorsed the tax. The law has also survived a state Supreme
Court challenge on the grounds that it funds programs from a tax on an
unrelated product.</TE>
<TE>   With victory finally assured, Reiner thought it was time to move on to
something else. "The idea was just to pass this and let other people run
the program," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Governor-elect Gray Davis had other ideas and soon appointed Reiner to
the state commission overseeing the program. Reiner was about to learn
the difference between pushing for a $700-million program and running
one.</TE>
<TE>   As a piece of lawmaking, Prop. 10 is unusual. It does not earmark
funds for specific groups or address a single social ill. Instead it
channels the money to commissions in each of the state's 58 counties,
depending on their birth rates, and gives those commissions the power to
decide whether to spend it on abuse-prevention programs, early literacy,
parenting classes or most any other effort to help prepare children for
school. Los Angeles County gets the largest share of the funds, about
$150 million a year. Orange County is second, at $45 million.</TE>
<TE>   Money from the tax began accumulating immediately. "We came under a
lot of fire for not getting money out quickly enough," Reiner admits. "We
had terrible growing pains, just like any new program, fumbling and
feeling our way for the first year."</TE>
<TE>   The trouble was not only on the state level, which finally made the
first funds available in October 1999. In the first year, only 12
counties were far enough along to submit plans for spending their share
of the revenue. "These kinds of systemic reforms take time," Ross says.
"You can see Rob exhibiting a fair amount of frustration with the pace of
change."</TE>
<TE>   As the Reiner family's longtime friend Mel Brooks would say: It's good
to be the king. On a movie set, Reiner is king. In Sacramento, he is one
of seven voting members of the commission. "You see his Hollywood modus
operandi on a regular basis," says Mark Friedman, executive director of
Alameda County's commission. "As a director, when he says, 'We're going
to do the scene this way,' they do it that way. Government doesn't work
that way. He isn't able to rule by fiat, so the potential [for friction]
is there."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina sat on the county Prop. 10
commission's first meeting. She recalls early discussions with Reiner
over whether the local commissions would be an adjunct of the county
governments or independent entities. "When he came to the board, he said,
'I want it to be independent, so it will be.'</TE>
<TE>   "Well, no, that's not how it works here," she said. Molina had sided
with Reiner from the start. Even so, "We had to educate him how to do it,
you know, we have to set up a structure so there's no liability.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'It's got to be independent. If the county wants to apply
for funds, they can.' "</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, the board eventually came around to Reiner's point of
view, and Molina still marvels at the achievement. "For the Board of
Supervisors to let go of power, especially when it's control of that
amount of money . . . it's rare."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after that initial meeting, Molina says she saw Reiner soften his
auteur approach to leadership. "He let go of it. He's interested in what
we're doing, and in getting the money out. He hasn't limited it by
saying, 'This is what I want to fund.' He's let the commission blossom on
its own."</TE>
<TE>   Running monthly state commission meetings with gavel in hand, Reiner
is required to follow Robert's Rules of Order. "He makes the meetings
livelier," says Friedman. "He'll say, 'OK, conversation's over, let's
move forward and get some action.' And then, oftentimes, Rob will make a
motion. I've chaired a committee and I never made a motion. There's
nothing in Robert's Rules that says the chair can't make a motion, but
it's not done."</TE>
<TE>   Some rules, however, are inflexible. "When you take the job, you get a
tutorial from the attorney general's office," Reiner explains. "They take
you aside and tell you about the Bagley-Keene [Open Meeting] Act," which
requires state agencies to post their agendas 10 days before a meeting
and then to keep to those agendas when they do gather. It also forbids
more than two commissioners from discussing government business in
private. In other words, the opposite of how negotiations are done in
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>    A show business scion, Reiner wrested an enviable career as a movie
director out of an early decision to leave television after "All in the
Family." Currently on Nick at Nite, you can see a young, long-haired
Reiner routinely blowing up at his TV father-in-law over politics. Taking
nothing away from his acting ability, Reiner likely would agree that the
role wasn't a stretch. He still punctuates statements that he believes
should be apparent to anyone harboring a shred of sense with hand and
facial gestures suggesting Borscht Belt Kabuki. His voice still soars and
accelerates when he starts in on a topic about which he's passionate. It
can be baby brain science or, as he explains the Ziploc bag of healthy
snacks he was rarely without, Weight Watchers. "This sandwich, Allison,
how many points do you think?" he asks as we sit in traffic during his
guided tour.</TE>
<TE>   "Uh, three?"</TE>
<TE>   "No! Six points! Two slices of bread!" The man who brought forth the
dimwit hilarity of "This Is Spinal Tap" turns out to be a wonk. He loves
the details. Kristina Schake, his communications director, leans over the
front seat to tell him about a focus group she attended the previous
evening, which examined how parents respond to some new English- and
Spanish-language educational videos to be included in new parent kits.
Already he is eager to start talking about adapting the videos for Asian
languages. She tells him the languages most spoken in the state are
Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese.</TE>
<TE>   "What about Hmong?" asks Reiner, concerned about leaving out some
75,000 immigrants living in California.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't really have a written language," Schake says, visibly
relieved she had recently learned the answer to that question. "Well,
they do, but it's relatively new." Reiner considers the puzzle: Hmong
subtitles are not an option, and producing a new video for one of the
state's smallest minority groups is an impractical use of funds. Later
they will decide that it might be best to work with Hmong-speaking
community groups to disseminate information.</TE>
<TE>   When we arrive at the central L.A. facility for Children's Institute
International, a group that has received Prop. 10 funding for its work
with victims of child abuse, Reiner easily joins a discussion with
clinical psychologists and others who have devoted their lives to caring
for traumatized children. The organization has been around since 1906
and, though Reiner calls it "the gold standard," he has a suggestion.
Assessing their in-home program, he points out, "You're reactive. You're
joining someone already in crisis. Have you thought of starting the home
visits prenatally?" His eyebrows rise, and sit up there as he pauses.</TE>
<TE>   "For instance, the David Olds model is more pro-active--you're not
waiting for a referral to come in." He must be the only former sitcom
star with a favorite home visitation program. As the chair of an agency
with $700-million purse strings, his ideas command attention, even if he
didn't have star power. But the latter never hurts.</TE>
<TE>   In his car on another afternoon he calls his secretary and asks to
speak with the agent for Orlando Magic forward Grant Hill. Moments later,
the pitch begins. He's making some teaching videos. Going to every new
family in California. Maria Shriver's in one, and Andy Garcia is in one
and Jamie Lee Curtis. He goes in for the get: "And I know Grant's a good
father and--oh? He doesn't have kids?" The conversation ends shortly
thereafter. Mildly embarrassed by the gaffe, Reiner recovers. He smiles
and shrugs. "Maybe we'll try Denzel Washington."</TE>
<TE>   Reiner campaigned for Gore in 2000, making several appearances to
leaven the candidate's humorless image. By November, when the election
had ground to a deadlock, Gore and Reiner had become good friends. As
luck would have it, Reiner was at the Gore home the next month, when the
Supreme Court was considering whether to continue counting the Florida
ballots.  "We were eating dinner when the word came that the white smoke
was about to come up over the Supreme Court building," Gore recalls.
Then, sometime after the lemon tart, came what Reiner calls the Truman
Show moment. "We literally run to turn on CNN and the guy on CNN is
saying, 'The vice president is at his residence, now tuned to CNN trying
to understand this ruling with the rest of us.'</TE>
<TE>   "I can recall two times in my life when I had a complete loss of
innocence," Reiner says. "The first was the Kennedy assassination. I was
16, and I remember thinking, 'This can happen in this country?'</TE>
<TE>   "The second time was that Supreme Court decision."</TE>
<TE>   Had Gore won, Reiner would have been well placed to further his goals
on the national level. "It would have been easier for me," he says.
Despite losing his inside track, Reiner tried a proven approach to reach
the new administration: He called the vice president's wife. Later that
month, he met with Lynne Cheney at her office at the conservative
American Enterprise Institute. "In the lobby were books by Robert Bork,
so I was nervous," Reiner says. "But she was great, really smart. We
differ politically, but philosophically, we agree. Where you get the core
differences is how much money to put toward this."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Reiner is comfortable with his limited role in government.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that I'll ever be one of them," he says of his
colleagues in Sacramento. "I'm a director and actor. But I don't think
they view me as someone treading on their turf."</TE>
<TE>   If the child advocacy world is thrilled to have a celebrity in its
midst, the film world is mostly indifferent. "Nobody in L.A., in this
industry, knows what I do," Reiner says. He's not complaining. In fact,
he sounds bemused.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knows about the meetings where I spend, eight, nine hours
sitting in a room talking about policy, which I've done on a monthly
basis for three years."</TE>
<TE>   Reiner will hold his post until 2005. Already, supporters are
concerned about his exit. "I am hopeful that he will continue to give of
his time," Molina says. "But if he said tomorrow, 'I'm making an epic,'
we would survive, because he has provided a lot of leadership."</TE>
<TE>   His sabbatical from Hollywood does raise the issue of whether Reiner
is more likely to return to movies or to pull a Reagan and commit to
politics. "I kid him that he's kind of a politician now," Gore says. "He
would put the emphasis on 'kind of,' so at least for now that stays in
the kidding category. But if he ever wanted to do something [in
politics], I'm sure he would have a lot of supporters. My sense is that
he's sort of primarily focused on the results, and he's getting a lot of
results this way."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if anyone has suggested that he has been away from film too
long, Reiner booms, "Anyone? How about every person that I meet? My wife
is killing me to go back!" Right now, several scripts have his interest.
He plans to start shooting one of them this year. There are other reasons
to give more attention to his old job. Submerged in his Prop. 10 work, he
was surprised and infuriated when he saw the Castle Rock release "Proof
of Life."</TE>
<TE>   "Meg Ryan smokes throughout that movie," he says, shaking his head.
"There's no reason for it." While Commissioner Reiner can proudly point
to a 35% drop in cigarette sales to minors in the first year after the
passage of Prop. 10, filmmaker Reiner recognizes that cinema has done
more to glamorize smoking than the tobacco industry can ever hope to.</TE>
<TE>   Now if someone is to light up frivolously in a Castle Rock film, he
wants the opportunity to talk the director or actor out of that choice.
Not long ago he met with Ryan Gosling, 21, who is playing the role of a
teenage murderer in a Castle Rock film directed by Barbet Schroeder.
Reiner took a hard line with the young actor.</TE>
<TE>   "Making this choice could conceivably get someone to start smoking,
and ultimately kill them. I just wanted you to know that," he told
Gosling. But the actor held his ground.</TE>
<TE>   Reiner later reports, "He's a Mormon. He doesn't smoke, doesn't drink,
doesn't swear. He's as clean-living as they come, and he did a tremendous
amount of research into this character. So, we're not going to be
censors, but if I were directing this film, I wouldn't let him smoke."</TE>
<TE>   Soon Reiner will be the director again. He'll be back in control of a
little world of his own making. There will be no smoking. And no
committees. And no show of hands.</TE>
<TE>   He's looking forward to it. "It's fun, first of all," he says without
apology. But there also are no plans to abandon his other world, with its
interminable meetings and red tape. "I didn't know what I was getting
into," the commissioner admits. "But that's OK, because it's a tremendous
opportunity to get things done. It's also a tremendous responsibility.
You can't just walk away. I'm not going to."</TE>

<DH>In the Face of Nazi Terror and the Murder of Innocents,  Marion
Pritchard Made a  Courageous Choice. She Knew Then-- as  Now--That
There's Really No Choice at All.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.R. MOEHRINGER</AU>
<BD>Times staff writer J.R. Moehringer last wrote for the magazine
about a former boxer living on the streets of Orange County</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the sun dips behind the Vermont tree line, the family sits down
to dinner and the talk goes in a thousand  directions--books, politics,
the Red Sox. Eventually the conversation turns to Grandma, and the Nazi
she gunned down.</LD>
<LD>   Grandma looks into her lap, shyly. The adults discuss the story in low
voices while the children strain to hear from the far end of the table.
"What are you talking about?" says Marion Pritchard's 12-year-old
granddaughter, Molly.</LD>
<LD>   Silence. "Grandma and the policeman," someone says.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh," Molly says--not shocked, but bored. She's heard that story a
million times.</TE>
<TE>   It often happens this way. Pritchard's family doesn't get too excited
about her daring past. They glide over the fact that  she rescued scores
of children from the Holocaust, survived seven months in a Nazi prison
and killed one Nazi who got in her  way. They take for granted that
Grandma is a war hero--or else they can't quite believe it. The stories
of extraordinary bravery don't fit with the aproned woman they see before
them, who is frightened of squirrels and public speaking and who feels
guilty when she swats a fly.</TE>
<TE>   Strangers tend to be less casual about Pritchard's past. Psychologists
study her, biographers woo her, governments fete her and invite her to
speak. Visitors occasionally appear at her door, unannounced, to meet
her, shake her hand, thank her.</TE>
<TE>   Lately interest in Pritchard has grown even more avid. People want to
be around her, now more than ever, because they know she's been here
before: a nation under attack, a constant state of fear, a fanatic enemy
bent on killing innocent civilians, especially Jews. The last time,
Europe was ground zero, and Pritchard was one of those who ran into the
fire.</TE>
<TE>   But for a profile in courage, she keeps a fairly low profile. She
lives at the end of a dirt road, in the middle of a sparse woods, on the
outskirts of a town--Vershire, Vt.-- that doesn't appear on many maps.
She spends her days reading, teaching, seeing patients--she's been a
psychoanalyst most of her working life--and listening to her beloved
Verdi. You might hear "Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves" wafting from the open
windows of her big white farmhouse when you turn off the dirt road.</TE>
<TE>   As history does its ominous U-turn, she watches quietly from a safe
distance. This isn't her fight. And yet, when hatred  hits closer to
home, she reverts instantly from recluse to rescuer. When anti-Semitism
and homophobia flared in her corner of Vermont not long ago, Pritchard
fought back with everything she had.</TE>
<TE>   People want to know where this 81-year-old woman gets her grit. She
eludes the question the way she once eluded her pursuers. "There's
nothing you can tell somebody that's going to make them less fearful,"
she says in her faint Dutch  accent. "I was scared stiff all the time
during the war."</TE>
<TE>   She prefers to let her life speak for itself. And its lessons are
clear:</TE>
<TE>   You can't always hide from hate.</TE>
<TE>   Or from history.</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes it's best not to try.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in her garden, not much taller than her sweet peas and
daylilies, Pritchard doesn't look like the intrepid rescuer who defied
the Third Reich. Sitting in her book-lined living room, speaking in a
thin voice that crackles like a fire, she gives no hint of the cunning
rebel who risked her life for strangers.</TE>
<TE>   She hides the hero somewhere inside.</TE>
<TE>   When the memory of an injustice comes up, though, her blue eyes
darken, her voice takes on a ragged quality, like a gypsy violin, and
there she is, in plain sight, Marion van Binsbergen, the young girl who
tried to save the world one child at a time. It happens when she
remembers Hitler's shock troops devouring Europe in 1940, smashing into
Amsterdam, where she was  living with her younger brother and her
parents. Overnight, the streets were filled with Nazis, "all 6 feet tall"
and smug, she says.</TE>
<TE>   She heard stories. Mass arrests. Night trains. Camps. She knew what
was happening, but she didn't really know, until one  day: She was 20
years old, riding her new bicycle near the school of social work where
she was a graduate student, when she saw a truck double-parked outside a
Jewish children's center. Some Nazi soldiers were rousting the
children--all between 2 and 8 years old--and rushing them onto the truck.
The children were sobbing. The soldiers were pitiless and efficient.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't take long," she says.</TE>
<TE>   One soldier grabbed a little girl by her pigtails and hurled her onto
the truck.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe what I was seeing," Pritchard says. "Two women
came from the other side of the street to try to stop them, and [the
Nazis] threw them in with the kids."</TE>
<TE>   She seems to be watching the 60-year-old scene play out in the middle
of her living room, each detail as clear as the books and rugs and
potbellied stove, and she becomes angry all over again. "That," she says,
"was indeed the moment when I  decided what was the most important thing
to do."</TE>
<TE>   Pritchard decided to rescue Jews--hide them, smuggle them, help them
however she could. Though not Jewish herself, she made rescuing Jews her
mission, for no reason other than that it was right.</TE>
<TE>   People who make such decisions are the products of extraordinary
parents, says Eva Fogelman, who has studied Holocaust  rescuers,
including Pritchard, for years. Most rescuers, Fogelman has found, were
given an exquisite sense of justice as children, along with an unwavering
self-confidence, "so they could withstand fears."</TE>
<TE>   Pritchard remembers, for example, an exchange between her mother and
the Germans. "The Nazis were looking for able-bodied men," she says.
"They came and made my brother get out of bed. He was 14 at the time.
Fortunately, he was still small and skinny, and they told him he could go
back to bed. Then they said to my mother, 'What are you doing with all
that bunting?'  My mother had all this red, white and blue material out
on the kitchen table. My mother was a lady. She never swore. But she
said, 'I'm making a Union Jack--to hang out the window when you sons of
bitches get kicked out of here! "'</TE>
<TE>   Pritchard coughs and covers her mouth. She looks away, and her eyes
fill with tears. "It's funny," she says. "You can tell a tale a lot of
times, and then suddenly, for some reason, it gets harder."</TE>
<TE>   Pritchard estimates that she helped 150 Jews, nearly all of them
children. She doesn't know the precise number. She didn't keep track, in
case she was caught. "The less you knew, the better."</TE>
<TE>   Nor does she know how many of the children she helped were able to
survive the war. She would hide a child for a day, an  hour, then pass
the child along, into the night, into the woods, into history. She only
knows that most of Holland's 140,000 Jews were killed, so it's likely
that most of the children she met didn't make it. She gave them, at best,
a few more days, or hours. Hers may have been the last kind face they
saw.</TE>
<TE>   Every rescue was different. She'd bring a child home, or simply to the
next rescuer. She'd guide a child in the night to a safe house, or a
clearing in the woods. She'd place a Jewish newborn with  a non-Jewish
couple. Occasionally, she'd walk a child in the light of day right past a
group of Nazi soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, Pritchard was honored by Yad Vashem, Israel's official
Holocaust authority, as one of the "Righteous Among the  Nations." Her
name was placed in the pantheon of Israel's national heroes, alongside
Holocaust rescuers such as Oskar  Schindler. She was recognized as one of
the great moral exemplars of the century, from whom, the writer Cynthia
Ozick wrote, "we can learn the full resonance of civilization."</TE>
<TE>   And still she regrets not doing more. She's haunted by the children
she couldn't save, the countless Anne Franks. She knew Anne Frank, in
fact. And Anne's older sister, Margot. She met them once at a birthday
party. Years later, a mutual friend  met the Frank sisters at
Bergen-Belsen, and saw them die.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the children who passed briefly through Pritchard's hands, she
hid one Jewish family for the duration of the war. She took Fred Polak
and his three children--Lex, 7, Tom, 4, and Erica, an infant--to a
farmhouse on the outskirts of the city and cared for them as though they
were her own while their mother fought with the Dutch Resistance.</TE>
<TE>   By day, Pritchard and the family kept to a routine, playing and
walking in public, pretending to be non-Jews. At night, when the Nazis
came around and demanded everyone's papers, Pritchard hid the family in a
pit beneath the living room floor. Whenever Pritchard heard a motor
coming up the road, she hurried the Polak family into the pit. "Regular
people didn't have motors," she says. "Only Germans. So when you heard a
motor, you knew."</TE>
<TE>   Even when the Nazis weren't coming, she made the Polaks practice
sliding away the coffee table, pulling up the floorboards, diving into
the pit. Survival hinged on doing the drill faster and faster. "We got it
down to 30 seconds," she says, still proud.</TE>
<TE>   Pritchard was arrested during the war, but not for rescuing Jews. She
was simply studying with friends who were part of the Dutch Resistance,
and when the Nazis raided the apartment, everyone was taken, Pritchard
included.</TE>
<TE>   Memories of prison return to her, unbidden, at odd moments. In an
elevator or a strange bathroom, if the door doesn't open right away, she
feels trapped. Having a manicure, she recalls the way she filed her nails
in prison, by rubbing them against her cell walls.</TE>
<TE>   Every detail of prison remains vivid, but she doesn't share them. "I
never have told, and I don't know whether I ever will tell, about the
relatively minor torture I underwent."</TE>
<TE>   She does describe, with a self-mocking smile, her sudden surge of
religion. "It came naturally. 'Dear God, if you let me out of here, I'll
be good forever after.' "</TE>
<TE>   She was better than her word. When the Nazis set her free after seven
months, she went back to rescuing Jews and took even greater risks,
helping to pull off a daring kidnap in which she stormed a house and
snatched a 2-year-old girl whom the Nazis were about to torture--their
way of making her parents name members of the Dutch Resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the Nazi she killed, a sadistic Dutch policeman she'd
known all her life. He surprised her one night at the farmhouse, no sound
of a motor to warn her, no time to hide the Polaks in the pit. Acting on
a tip, the policeman crept up to the farmhouse on foot and burst in the
door. "Somebody must've betrayed us," Pritchard says.</TE>
<TE>   In that terrible moment, Pritchard says, there was no choice. Behind
some books on a shelf was a gun given to her by a friend. She grabbed the
gun and fired. "One shot," she says. "Dead as a doornail."</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't remember pulling the trigger. She doesn't remember feeling
anger or regret. "I remember the exhilaration when he was lying on the
floor," she says. After covering the policeman with a sheet, she phoned a
friend, Karel Poons. He arranged for the  body to be smuggled to an
undertaker, to be buried secretly with a recently deceased resident of
the town. "Oh," she says,  in the ragged violin voice, "Karel was
wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   She thought of him often in 2000, when Vermont legislators voted to
let gay couples "marry," plunging the state into a yearlong political
crisis. Poons was gay, and it couldn't have mattered less to Pritchard.
She loved him, trusted him with  her life. So when the debate over gay
rights in Vermont turned ugly, she took it personally.</TE>
<TE>   But she kept quiet for the sake of her patients. "If someone comes to
me who is an ardent Republican," she says, "I want them to be able to
tell me anything."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, as she feared, the anti-gay rhetoric spawned something
darker. Swastikas began to appear all around her, on lawns and mailboxes
and the elementary school across the street from her office. She couldn't
keep quiet any longer.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the local newspaper, Pritchard gave Vermonters a stern
history lesson, reminding them that Hitler began by persecuting everyone
"different." Then she hammered signs into her front yard, supporting
candidates friendly to gay rights.</TE>
<TE>   One night her phone rang. A menacing voice told Pritchard to take down
her signs "or you'll be sorry."</TE>
<TE>   The signs stayed.</TE>
<TE>   The voice called again.</TE>
<TE>   The signs stayed.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, someone crept up to Pritchard's farmhouse in the middle of
the night, no sound of a motor to warn her, and stole the signs. It felt,
she says, as if the past itself had crept out of the shadows. "I never
thought," she says, "in  Vermont of all places--"</TE>
<TE>   Meeting Pritchard many years after the war, Erica Polak had trouble
believing that this small, dignified grandmother was once all that stood
between her and the camps. "She's such a tiny woman," Erica says by phone
from her home in Holland. "She came from a very sophisticated family. And
then, to go underground, to do such brave things? It's unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Erica's mother never discussed the war. And with Pritchard, Erica
feels the same reticence. Revealing means reliving.</TE>
<TE>   "She lets go of a tiny piece at a time," Erica says, "and most things
she doesn't let loose at all."</TE>
<TE>   The honor from Yad Vashem seemed to loosen Pritchard a bit. She began
to accept speaking invitations. Last fall she even helped teach a seminar
at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., the only college in the nation
to offer an advanced degree in Holocaust Studies. Despite cataracts and
heavy traffic on the interstate, Pritchard sometimes drove herself to the
school, four hours each way.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Dwork, who heads the center for Holocaust Studies at Clark and
taught the seminar with Pritchard, says the students would fall perfectly
silent whenever Pritchard spoke. One young woman confided to Dwork: "I
never thought in my life I'd have the opportunity to be at the same table
as a saint." Dwork feels the same way. "Just being with her makes me
calmer," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Each class began with Pritchard sharing a wartime memory. Then there
would be a discussion of the week's assigned reading. The final hour of
class was given over to the latest news. The students asked Pritchard for
her take, and she gave it, unvarnished. One day she spoke about walking
the razor's edge, about living each day in danger. She told the students
that terrorism is yet another of life's perils, no more lethal than all
the others. Evil didn't end with World War II, she said.</TE>
<TE>   You can't always hide from hate. Or from history.</TE>
<TE>   It was as close as she comes to giving advice. "The notion that
someday everything in the world is going to be lovely, I haven't had that
for a long, long time," Pritchard says. "I guess I hoped that right after
World War II. But humans don't change, it seems."</TE>
<TE>   In those heady days after the war, there were many reasons for
optimism, but the main reason was U.S. Army Lt. Tony Pritchard, who did
what the Nazis couldn't. He found Marion van Binsbergen.</TE>
<TE>   He spotted her at a Paris rail station, where they were both bound for
the refugee camps--he with the Army, she with the United Nations. They
got into an argument immediately. She scolded him for complaining to a
fellow soldier about all the "awful Dutch girls." He told her that he was
simply remarking, "What an awful lot of Dutch girls."</TE>
<TE>   She laughed, and so it began.</TE>
<TE>   "It's summer, it's peace," she says. "After years of deprivation, of
no food and no fun, suddenly you're on the French coast. We got American
officer Army rations, which included liquor and wine. I'd never had hard
liquor before."</TE>
<TE>   They married in 1947, her wedding dress sewn by concentration camp
survivors. A few months later, they came to the U.S., first to Cambridge,
Mass., where they started their family, eventually to Vermont, in 1967.
It was Tony who found the Vermont house, part of an old dairy farm, with
120 acres of white birches and sugar maples, set in the middle of raw
wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   Rebuilding the house was Tony's passion until he died 10 years ago.
Now keeping the house is Pritchard's mission. It takes daily courage.
Besides intruders in the shadows, she must contend with the brutal cold,
the isolation, the temperamental septic tank and the steep staircase,
down which she recently took a bad fall.</TE>
<TE>   She deems it a small price to pay for staying connected to Tony, her
fellow hero, who fought with Patton at the Battle of the Bulge and went
with the first troops into the nightmare of Buchenwald. She and Tony
could talk about anything, Pritchard  says, which was vital, because they
often couldn't talk to anyone else. At dinner parties and other social
events, they were discouraged from describing the horrors they witnessed.
Too depressing, friends said. Move on.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, their silence included their children. Pritchard's three
sons--52-year-old Arnie and the 49-year-old twins, Ivor and Brian--didn't
know much about their mother's past until 1981, when Israeli officials
phoned to say that Pritchard would soon receive one of their nation's
most sacred honors.</TE>
<TE>   In Israel, Brian watched as his mother received the thanks of a
nation. She was showered with praise, he says, and blinded by flashbulbs.
Then the ceremony ended and everyone started for the doors--except for a
group of sad-faced men and women. They moved closer to his mother, their
hands extended, and he wondered who they could be.</TE>
<TE>   Then he realized. They were survivors of the camps.</TE>
<TE>   "That," he says, his voice unsteady, "was when I knew . . . ."</TE>
<TE>   Once, at a school, Brian heard his mother reveal the thing she never
reveals, the details of her time in prison. A boy in the audience asked
politely and Pritchard wasn't able to deny him a straight answer. She
told how the guards pressed a knife in her arm, demanding information.
When she wouldn't talk, they pressed harder.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time Brian had heard the story, and it explained the
scar on his mother's left forearm. It also made him wonder how many other
stories and scars will remain hidden forever.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never know all there is to know," Arnie says. But he quickly
adds: "I think I know enough."</TE>
<TE>   What the brothers do know is always hard to reconcile with the woman
their children call Grandma. "It challenges the imagination," says Ivor.
"To put these two things next to each other--these extraordinary heroic
things and the very ordinary experience of your mother, who's afraid of
some things and doesn't like to do some things, and is shy and
uncomfortable in front of people--it's incongruous."</TE>
<TE>   And so, after dinner, it may be the incongruity that causes
Pritchard's granddaughter to brush off the story of Grandma and the Nazi.
Instead, Molly wants to hear the birds.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, can we hear the birds?" she pleads.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to hear the birds?" Pritchard says, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Molly nods.</TE>
<TE>   Pritchard stands up from the table and goes to the wall, where a cord
is fastened to a peg. She releases the cord and a bird cage slowly
descends. A gift from Pritchard's childhood ballet teacher in Amsterdam,
the bird cage is so old, so delicate, that Pritchard keeps it suspended
from the ceiling, out of harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the cage are two birds made of luminous paper, and underneath
is a key, which Pritchard now winds tight. When she releases it, the
birds spin to face each other, and their beaks fly open. The room
suddenly fills with bird song.</TE>
<TE>   The children stare in awe. The adults tilt their heads and smile. The
sound is beautiful but also haunting. Like voices from a vanished world.
It's not possible to know what they are saying. But it's clear that they
are somewhere other than this  delicate hiding place above Pritchard's
kitchen, and that they are happy and free.</TE>

<DH>Pasadena-Raised Conservationist J. Michael Fay Hiked 455 Days and
1,200 Miles to Help Save Uncharted Central Africa--Quite Possibly a
Record for Someone Running Away From Home</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. KIGER</AU>
<BD>Patrick J. Kiger last wrote for the magazine for a special issue on
the repercussions of Sept. 11</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After hiking through the last great unspoiled stretch of forest in
Africa, J. Michael Fay has returned to civilization. It doesn't seem to
agree with him. It's a spring weeknight, and Fay--the star of "Africa
Extreme," a National Geographic television special last year, and the
subject of a lavishly illustrated three-part series in the society's
magazine--is on the Upper East Side of Manhattan at the Explorers Club, a
vaguely musty, wood-paneled post-Victorian shrine to that era when the
jungles and mountains and icecaps of the earth were a stomping ground for
hale, hearty aristocrats, the sort you could imagine swapping stories
about their rollicking adventures over apres-dinner brandy and cigars. By
contrast, the 45-year-old naturalist, who is here to lecture on the
1,200-mile journey he's dubbed the "Megatransect," looks something less
than hale and hearty, and a tad shy of rollicking.</LD>
<TE>   Months of subsisting on fufu--a gruel made from a potato-like African
plant--Quaker oats and candy bars have left him so skinny that he'd make
a supermodel envious. He's clad in wrinkled khakis and a long-sleeved
shirt adorned with a fine patina of fuzz, and his steel wool-colored hair
hasn't recently encountered a comb. If Fay looks like hell, he feels even
worse. While on the trip, he contracted filaria, a blood-borne
infestation of tiny, threadlike worms that, if left untreated, can block
the flow of lymph inside a victim's body and cause the extremities to
swell to a grotesque size. He's not quite that far gone, thanks to a
powerful drug he's taking. But scores of the dying buggers are
accumulating in his fingertips, treating him to red-hot jolts of pain.
Fay grimaces and peers through Coke-bottle glasses--he's had trouble with
his eyesight since childhood--into a forest of Brooks Brothers suits and
elegant dresses.</TE>
<TE>   "What was your greatest discovery?" someone asks.</TE>
<TE>   Fay grimaces a bit again. "I, ah, didn't go out there to discover
anything," he explains with a faint touch of exasperation.</TE>
<TE>   He gets that question a lot. Armchair explorers expect a new species,
or 10 new species, or some natural wonder that outdoes Niagara Falls and
the Grand Canyon. How does Fay explain what he really discovered out
there during endless weeks of hacking through the foliage, months of
hiking farther and farther into the forest, into a place humans had not
visited for centuries? What Fay had found out was that he was able to
free himself.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the fictional Tarzan, to whom Fay sometimes jokingly compares
himself, he wasn't raised by apes. He grew up in a 1950s tract-house
development in Pasadena--the asphalt-paved, ChemLawn-drenched,
gas-guzzler-in-the-driveway epicenter of what he came to deride as "10-X
America." Ever since he could remember, he had felt ill at ease with the
civilization that spawned him, with phone bills and neckties and
sport-utility vehicles and paper cups and the relentless, insatiable
craving to consume everything in its path.</TE>
<TE>   The Megatransect freed Fay from that. It allowed him to flee into a
world in which he wore only shorts and sandals because it was easier to
slip unobtrusively through the flora in bare skin. He could drink from
unpolluted streams where the only roads were paths hewn by generations of
elephants over thousands of years. He could gaze at a 175-foot-tall Moabi
tree, its sprawling branches outstretched like the arms of some primitive
deity, beckoning him to worship. Silverback gorillas stared at him as if
he were some new animal, and not merely another member of that race of
highly evolved killers bent on laying waste to their world. How does a
guy like Fay explain that what he really discovered was that he didn't
want to come back?</TE>
<TE>   Even for someone who resolutely loathes civilization, leaving it
behind isn't easy. In one of Fay's journal entries from the Megatransect,
composed six months into his journey, he wrote: "It's a world that looks
like what a Stone Age man, coming out of his rock shelter, would have
seen--no traces of mankind, just wild nature. It's like being transported
back in time 10,000, even a million, years."</TE>
<TE>   He composed that missive on a battery-powered notebook computer and
then e-mailed it via satellite phone to National Geographic's Web site,
which gives a hint of the myriad paradoxes and contradictions that
inhabit the tangled underbrush of this explorer's soul. Fay is a sort of
21st century primitive, one foot in the jungle and one on the
indoor-outdoor carpet. He is equal parts Thoreau-esque ascetic and gadget
freak, serious scientist and media showman, environmental zealot and
negotiator who cuts deals with logging company executives and counts
conservative politicians as his friends. He's an altruistic lover of
humanity in the abstract, and an unsentimental loner who eschews intimate
relationships in the particular.</TE>
<TE>   But one thing is clear: Fay is emerging as one of the most important
explorers of the age, one who evokes comparisons to figures such as David
Livingstone, the 19th century trekker whose journeys across the African
interior shaped European views of the continent. "When it comes to a
practical knowledge of the geography of central Africa, there is hardly
anybody around who knows what he knows, who's been where he has, who's
documented it," explains Peter Raven, the renowned botanist and
conservationist who heads the Missouri Botanical Garden and served as an
early Fay mentor. "In that sense, he's a classical explorer. But he's
much more than that. He's living at a moment in time when the last
forests are being destroyed, where the opportunity to save that world is
fading rapidly."</TE>
<TE>   Fay's Megatransect aimed to document that vanishing wild and to
jump-start efforts to save at least some of it from destruction. In
September 1999, on a trip sponsored by the National Geographic Society
and his employer, the Wildlife Conservation Society, Fay started out from
an outpost in the Republic of the Congo with a team of 10 Pygmies and
National Geographic photographer Nick Nichols. His goal: to walk across
the forests of the Congo and Gabon, through territory he had identified
from the air as largely free of human encroachment--for the previous
several hundred years, at least.</TE>
<TE>   During the next 455 days, Fay and various companions--he had to hire a
second team halfway through after he wore out his first entourage--hacked
their way through the foliage, communicating with one another by
satellite pager as they searched for spots where airplanes dropped the
packages of food they needed to survive. Eventually, in December 2000,
they reached the west coast of Africa.</TE>
<TE>   In "Africa Extreme," millions of TV viewers got to watch a nearly
naked, bearded, feral-looking Fay howl at wild animals, chase away
poachers, exhort his crew in angry bursts of French and curl up in a
trembling heap to endure a bout of malaria, and then, finally,
exultantly, stride onto a beach where hippos bodysurfed in the waves. It
seemed like the penultimate sequel to "Survivor." But Fay wasn't just out
to make a name for himself as the svelte successor to the Naked Guy. He
wanted to sound the alarm about the threat to central Africa's forests,
where trees are vanishing under the saw blades of European loggers as
gorillas and other animals are slaughtered by hunters filling urban
Africans' hunger for meat.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking, 'Let's put these places on the map,' " says Fay.
"We've seen so much change in the last five years. Every day that we
wait, there's a new road or a new concession given out or a new decree
made or a new project that is going to bring a human population to an
isolated place. I'd found these blocks of forest, but it wouldn't take
long before they'd be cut up, integrated into another direction of this
human wave, and it'll be impossible to protect them."</TE>
<TE>   Fay also aimed to do serious science. He wanted to document in detail
the differences as he moved from a human environment into the wild and
then out again. And he hoped to show the extent to which even seemingly
small changes wrought by humans--the harvesting of certain trees, for
example--affected the entire system of the forest.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, he meticulously scribbled hundreds of pages of journal
notes, recording virtually everything he saw, from the location of fruit
trees to the peripheral traces of human encroachment--every machete cut
or shotgun shell or mound of campfire ashes. "We know the location of
every single elephant dung pile along that 1,200-mile route," Fay boasts,
"and what the density of piles was, going from human areas to center and
back."</TE>
<TE>   Those notes were augmented by 420 hours of video, 100 hours of digital
audiotape and 2,000 rolls of film shot by Nichols. Every written
observation, sound and image was tagged by Global Positioning Satellite
coordinates, which Fay's gadgetry recorded every 20 seconds. He intends
to post his data on the Internet so that it can be used by anyone who
wants to study the African wild.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike looked at the landscape at a scale that most people don't get
down to," says John Robinson, vice president of the Wildlife Conservation
Society. "But the point of view is even more important. You don't usually
have the opportunity to be away from the modern world for that length of
time. Mike crossed over to the wild side and went in deep enough and
stayed there long enough that, as he walked, he could see the effects
people on the outside were having on the natural environment he was in."</TE>
<TE>   And while other researchers and conservationists in Africa often have
focused on one piece of the puzzle, Fay has roamed across not just miles,
but scientific disciplines--he's a botanist, anthropologist and, before
the Megatransect, did important research on gorillas and elephants. This
has enabled him to develop a rare understanding of the big picture, the
matrix of subtle interactions and interdependence among species that
allow the forest to be.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike really has a grasp of what makes life work out there," says
photographer Nichols, who also is Fay's longtime friend and confidant.
"Why you can't have the elephants without the trees, and why you can't
have the trees without the elephants. Mike is after the whole web of life
and in showing how if you [mess] it up, you'll never get it back."</TE>
<TE>   But when you get past the science, Nichols insists, "at the core of it
all is a kid who wants to spend time in the woods. He lives for that. His
biggest flaw is that he's so driven that he can't see anything else. He
doesn't take a break--after 15 months in the forest, he hadn't slowed
down a bit. He wanted to just keep going. His family is those trees,
those elephants. This is not a guy who likes to play cards or take a
vacation or do anything a normal person needs to do to stay sane. He
doesn't have any hobbies, far as I know. But I'll tell you something--
over the past two years, nobody on earth has had as much fun. For him,
the hard part was coming back out."</TE>
<TE>   "The first month back, I was kind of in shellshock," says Fay. he's
sitting in the patio of a Starbucks in Washington, D.C., not far from
National Geographic's headquarters, where, as an explorer-in-residence,
he's spent the past few months laboriously crunching data and
transcribing notes from his trip. "But now that I'm settling in, I'm
coming to the realization that I really feel very left out in the U.S. of
A. Spiritually speaking, I really don't have a place here anymore."</TE>
<TE>   He means that both figuratively and literally. When Fay moved back to
Washington, Nichols recalls, the Geographic had to dissuade him from
simply pitching a tent in Rock Creek Park. Even now, he remains
discomfited by sleeping indoors, and the formalities of urban
civilization--making sure the electric bill is paid, for example--add to
his tension. Don't get him started on flush toilets or drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   "In the forest you just drink from creeks, like you would in a Tarzan
movie," he says. "Every one of them is crystal clear and the water is
delicious. I drink out of a faucet here and it almost makes me sick, it
tastes so terrible. Those plastic bottles of water are even worse. So I
don't drink much water." He still flirts with the notion of packing up
his bedroll and taking to the streets. "See that guy over there in the
yellow pants? He's homeless, sleeps over there. I try to talk to him
every once in a while. But he drinks all his coffee at Starbucks--that
guy's not hurting. He's fat. I could easily live on the street here and
not feel deprived one bit."</TE>
<TE>   The unrelenting abundance of America, in fact, makes Fay only feel
more alienated. "People try to feed me all the time, try to give me food.
I haven't been to a grocery store since I've been here. They keep asking,
'What did you fantasize about eating when you were out there?' In the
forest, that's not the way you think. If it's edible, it's good enough.
What you're thinking about is, do we have enough food for 13 people for
the next 10 days? Because if you don't, you're going to go hungry."</TE>
<TE>   Fay's iron self-control would make Jenny Craig seem like Diamond Jim
Brady. "He can go all day without eating or drinking," marvels Nichols.
"He's just got that drive. He's almost inhuman in that regard."</TE>
<TE>   But the Megatransect pushed Fay's stoicism to new extremes. "When you
go out on a short expedition you can be miserable, get an infection, feel
yourself getting weak physically--and then you're out and you can
recuperate. You hear a lot of conservationists say that--'Yeah, man, we
did three weeks in there and, God, it was really awful.' But when you're
out there for the long haul, you can't be that way. You have 30 worms
growing in your foot and it hurts like hell, but you just learn not to
think about it."</TE>
<TE>   He hiked for 10 months with a broken tooth. "When I got back to the
States, the dentist looks at it and says, 'Uh huh, it's really
bad--completely dead, infected up into the bone. You're lucky this thing
didn't blow your head right off your body.' " But it didn't. Instead, "my
brain kept saying, 'Hey, body, you can't allow this to happen because if
it does, it's gonna mean the end of this thing.' "</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he attained a state of being in which he suspects all
humans once existed. "People anywhere on earth who live outside learn it.
Even these homeless people here in Washington. They learn how to be
comfortable. There's one guy who lives over there"--he gestures toward
the doorway of a nearby building--"he's asleep right now. He's found his
little spot in the world, he's got his four or five blankets. I walk by
him every morning and say hello. He's just, like, hanging out. He doesn't
have a problem, far as he's concerned. When you think about the Plains
Indians or the Eskimo, or any people who are living in an ecosystem, they
get their [spot] for sure. If they didn't, they wouldn't survive."</TE>
<TE>   What of those of us accustomed to air-conditioning and Chicken
McNuggets, who perceive reality through the windshield of an SUV? "Lost
it 100%," Fay says. "To the point where it's one of the disconnects that
I have with people in the States. The Western model, the Industrial
Revolution and the path it's taken us down for the past 100 years, was a
terrible thing. This planet could still be an amazingly beautiful and
functional place, yet we've completely screwed it up. The [American] way
of life has permeated the entire world--the vehicles are the same, the
buildings, the foods people eat, the language. It's a way of life that,
almost by definition, is completely removed from the ecosystem because
ecosystems are variable, and it isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Fay finds himself trapped in the middle. He learned to fly a plane to
survey the African forests, but despite his auto-centric California
roots, he doesn't have a current driver's license, instead preferring to
get around on a secondhand bicycle or on foot. As he sees it, if 80% of
the vehicles vanished from Los Angeles and other cities, the quality of
life would improve. He knows it'll never happen.</TE>
<TE>   "People are obsessed with their cars. That's why I feel like such a
stranger here." One can only imagine how torturous it was for Fay to
spend his childhood in the then-new suburban development of Hastings
Ranch amid the artificially verdant lawns and multi-car garages that were
a badge of prosperity for the middle-class families who possessed them.
"I can't relate at all to what is going on in California now," laments
Fay, the second of three sons of Jim Fay, an insurance executive, and his
wife, Helen. "That was just as true when I was there in the 1950s and
1960s as a kid."</TE>
<TE>   The rusty haze in the air made him ill and, afflicted with a vision
problem that required surgery, he wasn't much for Little League. Instead
he found refuge in the hills behind his house.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike was exploring the woods from the time he was 4 years old," his
father recalls. "He was always interested in nature, more than anything
else. But California bothers him. I remember when he went back with us to
Los Angeles five or six years ago. We drove down the coast to Laguna, and
the smog was so thick there was this yellow haze over the ocean. Michael
almost had a tear in his eye. To him, all this burning of gasoline is
insane."</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, when Mike was 11, the Fays moved to Summit, N.J., but he
continued to evolve into a suburban iconoclast. Instead of hanging out at
the mall, he became obsessed with the then-uncool sport of fly-fishing
and spent his spare moments picking the brains of old guys in fishing
shops in the Catskills. ("I always used to fish with barbless hooks,
never keeping a fish," Fay says. "It was part of the whole nature thing,
learning the ecology.") He worked summers as a camp counselor in Maine,
leading other kids on long canoe trips, reading Thoreau and grooving on
conversations with older outdoorsy types who worked at the camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized you can be a bird guide for a living," he explains, "that
you didn't have to worry about having a traditional job to live."</TE>
<TE>   As a high school senior, he wanted to take three months off from
school and hike the John Muir Trail solo--"He saw an article in the
National Geographic and actually wrote to the man who'd done it,"
remembers his father, who nixed the idea. Instead, Fay went off to work
at a dude ranch near Tucson. He liked the desert and mountains so much
that he enrolled at the University of Arizona, though he lived in a
trailer because he couldn't stand the party animals in the dorms. He
studied botany and graduated second in his class in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Fay spent six years in the Peace Corps, working as a
botanist in national parks in Tunisia and the savannas of the Central
African Republic. It was there that he met Andrea Turkalo, a wildlife
biologist who became his wife. The two have what might politely be called
a long-distance relationship, living together for four of the last 22
years. For more than a decade, Turkalo has lived in a remote 30-acre
forest clearing in the Central African Republic, where she has been
conducting a long-term study of the complex social order among families
of forest elephants. The two communicate mostly by e-mail. "I don't look
at it as a sacrifice," Fay says. "For me, that kind of stuff--family
relations, wives, kids--are just distractions."</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, Fay enrolled in graduate school at Washington University in
St. Louis and began working for the Missouri Botanical Garden, where
botanist and conservationist Peter Raven was leading an effort to catalog
plant species in vanishing forests before they became extinct. Those dual
gigs gave Fay an opportunity to return to Africa, where he studied flora
in the mountains of western Sudan. But Fay's curiosity couldn't be
confined to plants, and he spent the latter part of the 1980s doing
research on the lowland gorilla population in the forests of the Central
African Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, his methods were intense; one favorite tactic was to set
out with a Pygmy tracker and follow a group of gorillas, discreetly
observing them from a few hundred yards away around the clock for days at
a time. It took Fay nearly a decade to get around to actually writing his
thesis. "He's much more interested in doing things than theorizing about
them," says Raven.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Fay spent his time working to create the Dzanga-Sangha and
Nouabale-Ndoki wildlife refuges in the Central African Republic and
Congo. "A lot of people worked in the effort, of course, but Mike was the
core point person," says John Robinson of the Wildlife Conservation
Society. "For Nouabale-Ndoki, he sat down with Congolese officials and
helped convince them to set aside certain lands."</TE>
<TE>   Fay's conservation work involved more than just politicking. He
personally led the effort to eradicate poaching in Dzanga-Sangha, on one
occasion barging into a poaching camp to torch the store of meat and
skins while his handful of rifle-toting guards held 60 angry people at
bay. When Nouabale-Ndoki was created in 1993, he headed the management
team and ran the park for three years.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after his appearance at the Explorers Club, Fay was back in
Africa for a quick visit, flying the Wildlife Conservation Society's
Cessna over the central African forests. What he saw unsettled him:
logging roads that didn't exist when he started the Megatransect.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an enormous scar through the landscape. We'd just walked
through the place the year before, and it was devoid of human beings. By
the end of the year, there's going to be a town of a thousand people in
that spot. You think, 'My God, there's no hope.' " In his desperation to
protect what remains of the African forests, the paper cup-eschewing
zealot has metamorphosed into a dealmaker and lobbyist, one surprisingly
adept at cultivating unlikely allies. He may be indifferent to eating,
but he's dined with logging company presidents and cajoled them into
banning hunters or setting aside blocks of habitats for apes and
elephants. He's not above seeking help from the World Bank, an
institution many environmentalists view as the Great Satan. He might
dream of banning cars, but his closest friend in Washington is a
free-market, anti-regulatory Republican from an oil state--former House
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer of Texas, now a senior tax
advisor at PricewaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   "What sets [Fay] apart from other environmentalists, to me, is that he
lives in the real world," says Archer. "He realizes that the reality of
Africa is that those countries need sources of income, and one of the
most attractive is the logging industry. If you go in and shut that off,
you're going to run afoul of their needs. Instead, you need to be able to
talk the loggers into working with you."</TE>
<TE>   Fay's latest gambit is raising money to create a new national park in
Langoue in central Gabon, and Fay believes he's close to clinching a deal
with the Gabonese government. "The forests in this area are very
special--the last populations of mega-elephants, naive gorillas who've
never seen humans, rivers that have never been fished, abundant with
crocodiles. We're trying to work with the government and the logging
companies to set aside 750,000 acres, to turn the clock back."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, he's willing to spend more time in the States chatting up
wealthy donors, even trading on the high-tech Tarzan caricature that
people saw on TV. The amount he needs to save that Eden is surprisingly
modest--about $3.5 million. "If I can raise that, I'll feel like the
Megatransect had one very tangible result," he says. Already he has
raised about $2 million, and he has promises from the government of Gabon
to protect 75,000 of those acres.</TE>
<TE>   But what Fay really wants to do is get back to the wild. He hopes to
start another, even more ambitious trek in May 2003. "Could be central
Africa, all of Africa, South America or North America," he wrote in a
recent e-mail. He talks of becoming the first totally wired
explorer--equip him with a Web cam and a notebook computer, air-drop some
supplies occasionally, and he can pump out real-time words and images of
the last wild places to a worldwide audience.</TE>
<TE>   "This time, I hope to be gone for five years," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But you get the feeling that, once he gets deep into the forest, he
may never return.</TE>

<HD>The Fellowship of the Hedge</HD>
<DH>Lovingly Rendered Paintings of the Gardens of Santa Barbara Give Us
Rare Views of a Near Mythical Landscape</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN HEROLD</AU>
<BD>Ann Herold is the managing editor of the magazine</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you look down at Montecito from a hilltop, it's almost
impossible to see much of the gardens, with their exotic plants and
lovely stone benches and poetic reflecting pools. There are too many
trees, for one thing, and even more hedges.</LD>
<LD>   But unlike traditional fences, hedges have holes, lots of them,
particularly if you are a child and not that far removed from the ground.
As children in the 1960s we would pop through the foliage like hobbits,
wandering along the edges of fantastic estates to get from one side of
this rich man's Eden to another. One of my favorite memories is of
emerging from a hedge to the sight of a long reflecting pool on which
floated pearl-white swans. Years later I would think I had dreamed it.</LD>
<LD>   You might find it alarming, these trespasses, except that we were shy
children and nervous, much like hobbits, and would never have thought of
harming anything. We also had a pronounced fear of caretakers, who we
were sure would arrest us on the spot. So our glimpses of this fairy-tale
beauty were often quick and fleeting.</LD>
<TE>   My mother, on the other hand, was much bolder. She would think nothing
of traipsing up to a deserted estate to wander inside some wreck of a
house. There was one grand manse whose original owner had achieved
notoriety by burying a gardener's cottage rather than wrestle with
officials over having it torn down. The house later fell into the hands
of a rich man's son who gutted it and then abandoned it like some fading
beauty. Another time we wandered outside the Waterman house, built by the
heir of a Pennsylvania mining and rail fortune, which had fallen into
complete disrepair--its last owners had simply moved from one room to
another as that section of plumbing or electricity or roofing started to
fail.</TE>
<TE>   It was a shame, because what had happened in Montecito in the early
part of the 20th century was the passionate cultivation of estates so
grand that they continue to amaze today. Many of the Eastern and
Midwestern financial elite who came for their vacations stayed on, and
some green streak in them took root. Among the most precocious of these
nouveau gardeners was Ganna Walska, an erstwhile opera singer and
collector of rich husbands. Her quirky vision resulted in Lotusland, a
massive estate where entire sections are devoted to primeval cycads or
otherworldly euphorbias or plants in shades of blue or larger-than-life
topiary figures, not to mention the abalone-shell grotto.</TE>
<TE>   While anyone can experience Lotusland, one of two estates open to the
public, all the others--the El Miradors and Il Brolinos--are hidden
behind their hedges. To see them, you would have to be a sprite, or one
of the 20 artists attached to the Easton Gallery in Montecito who spent
two years painting them for the book "Gardens of Santa Barbara."</TE>
<TE>   In renderings so sensitive to light that they quiver, one sees the
sumptuous Italianate grounds at El Mirador. Its benefactors, the Armours
of meatpacking fame, were so taken with the land that they built a
magnificent water garden but never completed a planned mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Another Midwestern dynastic transplant was the McCormicks of Chicago.
Their Riven Rock estate was home to a mentally ill son who, in periods of
lucidity, helped plan the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Italiante marvel Il Brolino had as its patron lumber heiress Mary
Stewart, who turned over her estate to Pasadena landscape architect
Florence Yoch. Not too far from Il Brolino was Arcady, where a Roman
pavilion loomed over a heated swimming pool and dressing rooms. In almost
Hearstian overkill, owner George Owen Knapp, a director of Union Carbide,
also commissioned an oval outdoor pool, a children's pool, a lily pond, a
water stair garden, teahouse and ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   No one had thought to evoke Spain's greatest glory, the Alhambra,
before St. Louis industrialist-turned-ironsmith George Steedman did it
with his gardens at Casa del Herrero. More than one of the book's
painters has captured its vivid tile work and outdoor rooms, open to the
public on a reservation system (much easier to obtain than at Lotusland,
which is booked ahead for months and months).</TE>
<TE>   But, as we saw on our explorations, many of Montecito's estates, and
the fortunes that created them, suffered in the ensuing decades. They
didn't bother to chase us away when my best friend and I lounged by the
unkempt pool at the San Ysidro Ranch. At the back of the Bacon estate,
the fallen trees began to take on a gothic look. The one estate mutilated
by vandals (horrible Gollums I imagine them to be) was the Bothin
Teahouse, where the magnificent stone aqueduct and water gardens were
ravaged.</TE>
<TE>   But the New Hollywood and its New Fortunes soon fell in love with
Montecito. We were already accustomed to filmdom's faces. Stuart Whitman
at the pharmacy, Eva Marie Saint at Miramar Beach, Jonathan Winters
sallying down Coast Village Road. But where they had practiced blending
in, the newcomers made their presence felt. Like cosmic plastic surgeons,
they nipped and tucked and smoothed over the scars of the sagging
beauties. Gene Hackman revived Piranhurst, once owned by Henry E. Bothin,
who built the view-rich teahouse for his wife and promptly died. Geena
Davis played at estate living at the magnificent Las Tejas, whose garden
had been so greatly altered from the original that it was decided not to
include it in the book. Ivan Reitman finally built the long-awaited
mansion on his portion of the divided El Mirador. At the revitalized San
Ysidro Ranch, now owned by Beanie Baby creator Ty Warner, the suite in
which John and Jackie Kennedy honeymooned now costs $1,850 a night. At
the Waterman house, every one of its dozens of rooms is again in fine
working order.</TE>
<TE>   And the Bacon estate's fortunes took the grandest turn of all. Oprah
Winfrey paid a reported $50 million for 42 acres of Francis
Underhill-designed vistas so beautiful that four different artists were
inspired to paint them for the "Gardens of Santa Barbara." And those wild
acres in back? On my jogs I can see that someone has cleared the dead
wood and weeds and rolled the boulders into gigantic piles.</TE>
<TE>   And those hedges? Like much of modern life, they are now lined by
fences. Absolutely hobbit-proof.</TE>

<DH>Sipping Sherry for Your Health Is a Nice Enough Ritual, but Cooking
With the Aperitif Takes Dinner to the Next Dimension</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN BOOE</AU>
<BD>Martin Booe last wrote for the magazine about Nobel Prize winner
Rudolph Marcus</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My dad spent part of his childhood in a genteel but crumbling brick
farmhouse built in the mid-1800s in Kentucky. When I was growing up, two
elderly aunts presided over the house. On the sideboard in the parlor
glinted a cut-crystal sherry decanter, which was opened for any visitor
who arrived after 2 p.m.--an unusual custom for a time and place where
alcohol was rarely kept in plain view and certainly never offered before
dusk. Neither of my great-aunts were tipplers, but their mother had been
English, and I'm fairly sure the ritual was imported.</LD>
<LD>   I always thought there was something enchantingly sacramental about
sherry, though elsewhere it was what you drank when you didn't want to
admit you were a drinking person. After all, my great-aunt told me, it
had medicinal properties. Sherry was thought to be good for the blood,
and doctors often recommended it as a tonic for older folks' nerves.</LD>
<TE>   (My maternal grandmother, a lifelong teetotaler, adjusted quite
happily to the two glasses she was admonished to drink before bedtime.)
But people cooked with it a lot, too, and when I was growing up it seemed
that every pantry was stocked with a bottle of "cooking sherry," which is
laced with enough salt to render it unsuitable for drinking. In the days
before Americans had discovered wine, buying a whole bottle to complete a
recipe seemed an unwarranted extravagance. Although its shelf life after
opening is overestimated, sherry keeps well for weeks when stored
properly, making it a reliable substitute for finishing off sauces, soups
and stews.</TE>
<TE>   Sherry has fallen off the map for purposes of both drinking and
cooking. I recently asked a respected local French chef if he ever cooked
with it. "But this is very old-fashioned!" he exclaimed, almost as if the
prospect alarmed him. However, with the resurgence of all things retro in
the cooking world, sherry certainly deserves revisiting. As an aperitif,
it is soothing to the stomach, calming to the nerves and cleansing to the
palate.</TE>
<TE>   In Spain, its country of origin, sherry is hardly reserved for
contemplative sipping. It was there about three years ago that I was
reintroduced to sherry. Traveling randomly through Andalusia, I got off a
bus in Malaga and plunged into Feria, a three-day bacchanal during which
the streets are clogged around the clock with sherry-fueled dancers
waving their bottles of Tio Pepe. Upon entering any bar or cafe, you're
issued a small fino cup fixed with a string necklace so you won't lose
it. Let the good times roll! I can only speculate that the Spaniards'
tolerance for large quantities of fortified wine (sherry's alcohol
content generally ranges from 15% to 23%) under a searing Andalusian sun
is acquired over generations. Two glasses in the summer heat and I was
ready to crawl under the bar for a nap.</TE>
<TE>   There are several varieties of sherry. The crisp, dry, straw-colored
finos and manzanillas are served chilled, and they cut well against
olives and salty snacks. The mellow, full-bodied olorosos are reminiscent
of walnuts and are fortifying in cooler weather. These rest easier on the
stomach than port after a meal. And there are, of course, the sweeter
cream sherries, which stand on their own for dessert. Sherry's most ready
application is in finishing sauces; a tablespoon of fino can add verve to
soups, pale dry sherry works well with chicken and for sauces
accompanying meats, and dry olorosos add depth and dimension.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, yes, dimension. Sherry has a way of putting you into another,
softer one without radically altering your consciousness the way, say, a
martini might. Maybe I'll buy a decanter and start offering a glass to
anyone who comes to visit after 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>Pollo al Jerez</TE>
<TE>   Serves 4-6</TE>
<TE>   1 chicken, cut into pieces</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons oil</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 cup good quality dry sherry, such as amontillado</TE>
<TE>   Heat oil in a deep skillet. Add chicken and brown on all sides over
medium heat. Set aside chicken pieces and drain off all but 3 tablespoons
of the liquid. Add garlic and saute until golden. Add sherry and bring to
a simmer, stirring with a wire whisk. Return chicken to skillet. Cook
over medium heat for about 20 minutes, until chicken is done. Remove fat
from sauce  and continue cooking about 10 minutes, or until remaining
liquid reduces to about one-half cup.</TE>

<LD>As I listened to a friend recount the story of his first trip to
Italy at the age of 20, I found myself thinking, I've never met anyone
who didn't fall in love with Italy. For this particular fellow, real
Italian food was the revelation. He ate everything in sight and once he
discovered spaghetti alla carbonara, that was it. He was so smitten he
had to have it once a day for the rest of the time he was there.</LD>
<LD>   People still come back from Italy ecstatic about meals they've had in
Florence or Naples or Venice, but the truth is, you don't have to go to
the mother country to find authentic Italian cooking anymore. At least
not in Los Angeles. And I doubt even in Italy that you could easily find
a spaghetti alla carbonara as satisfying on every level as Gino Angelinis
at the new Angelini Osteria in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Everything about this classic pasta dish is extraordinary: the way
each strand of spaghetti is bathed in the sauce of pancetta (unsmoked
Italian bacon), pancetta drippings, brassy gold egg yolk and good
Parmigiano-Reggiano. The pasta itself is Latini brand, extruded from
antique bronze dies, the better to grab the sauce. The taste is a
marvelous melding of cheese, egg, sweet cured pork and hard wheat pasta.
Even the way it sits on the plate is beautiful, an artful swirl of
strands standing taller than it is wide.</LD>
<TE>   Actually, the osteria part of the restaurant's name may be something
of a misnomer, because the cooking is so much better than the usual
down-home osteria. The quality of the ingredients sets Angelini Osteria
apart as much as the skilled cooking. Angelini is a highly accomplished
chef who came to L.A. in the mid-'90s when the late Mauro Vincenti
persuaded him to take the job as chef at Rex. (He later moved to Vincenti
when Vincenti's widow Maureen closed Rex and opened another Italian
restaurant on the Westside.) Now he's cooking the kinds of dishes
Italians revel in when they eat at home. As one Italian friend put it,
"Gino is like my mother. I know I can always get something good to eat."</TE>
<TE>   The place has the closely packed tables and high energy ambience of a
working-class osteria. A closer look reveals subtle, intelligent details:
walls painted the color of fresh cream, the swirled grain of the
honey-colored wainscoting, the simple sturdiness of the dark wood chairs,
the majolica jars packed with flowers. A ledge for lone diners has been
fitted into the bar, and three or four more seats look onto the
wood-burning pizza oven. The storefront is so small that there's no place
to wait, though you could do the Paris thing and sit outside in your coat
and muffler. The biggest drawback is the high noise level.</TE>
<TE>   Angelini's initial menu was a bit muddled, as if the chef couldn't
quite give up the idea of risotto with white truffles or composed salads
with orange sauce. After all, the received wisdom of many Italian chefs
here seems to be to stick to the small repertory of dishes Americans know
and like. But now, four months later, people are beginning to understand
and appreciate Angelini's food. You can feel the exhilaration of the chef
in the menu and in his cooking.</TE>
<TE>   I'm completely in love with his comforting zuppa di borlotti e
malfattini composed of plump brown borlotti beans and homemade pasta.
Sometimes he'll make minestra di riso e borlotti, which is basically the
same thing, with short-grained rice standing in for the pasta. Both need
just a swirl of green-gold olive oil and a grinding of black peppercorns.</TE>
<TE>   I can never eat here without at least sharing a plate of pasta. If you
see bombolotti all' amatriciana on the menu, don't hesitate. Bombolotti
are ridged tube pasta, about as long as they are wide. Cooked al dente to
an Italian standard, they're tossed in a deeply flavored tomato sauce
with guanciale, the cured pork cheek that's essential to a true
amatriciana, and freshly grated pecorino romano. Angelini nails it. I
also like the tagliolini with mussels and clams. His tagliolini are
almost as fine as angel hair, lightly cloaked in olive oil and the
shellfish juices, with the garlic discreetly in the background. Both
these pastas have the ideal balance of pasta to sauce. Taste either of
these, and you're tasting Italy.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing pretentious about Angelini Osteria. Much of it has to
do with manager Gino Rindone's warm presence. On a busy night, he seems
to be everywhere at once--ushering a party in the door, explaining the
specials, rushing out to carve something at the table. When the branzino
comes out in a battered aluminum baking pan, buried under a heap of
coarse salt that keeps the striped bass incredibly moist, he carefully
breaks the salt crust, peels away the skin and filets it onto your plate.
The finishing touch is a tiny bowl of olive oil and mixed
herbs--tarragon, thyme, dill, chervil and a squeeze of lemon.</TE>
<TE>   All eyes in the room follow the stinco--a shaggy hunk of veal shank on
the bone. Holding onto the shank with a napkin, Rindone carves the meat
into neat slices. Roasted and then finished off in the wood-burning oven,
stinco is succulent and slightly gelatinous, delicious accompanied by a
little potato puree, emerald rapini (broccoli rabe) and a little dish of
the meat's juices. Lately, Angelini often fires up the oven for
porchetta, a gorgeous caramelized hunk of pork. It also appears in a
delicious piadina flatbread sandwich at lunch.</TE>
<TE>   More unusual is cuttlefish with Swiss chard, like a chard stew with
the braised stems in the middle, surrounded by upturned cuttlefish
splashed with a tomato broth. A couple of dishes fall into the boring
category--the pork chop, the insalata mista--but nobody's making you
order them.</TE>
<TE>   French bistros have their plats du jour. Angelini Osteria has
specials, too. Wednesday it's oxtail. "They don't have to pay me, just
let me eat oxtail every night," our waiter says. This is the famous Roman
dish coda di bue alla vaccinara, slowly braised in wine and vegetables.
It's as thick as chocolate, tasting of bones and beef and everything
nourishing. But as it turns out, when we want to order it one night at 8
p.m., it's already gone.</TE>
<TE>   On Sundays, Angelini makes his mother's bollito (boiled veal) and
cappelletti (stuffed pasta). Monday nights it's kidneys trifolato, or
sauteed kidneys, a splendid dish for a big Barolo or Barbaresco from the
wine list.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of this wine list is that you can order a number of
interesting wines by the glass or by the carafe. These are cutting-edge
Italian wines, such as Martinetti's phenomenal Minaia Gavi, or a supple,
beautifully tailored Barbera from Barolo producer Domenico Clerico. The
moderate markups are another plus.</TE>
<TE>   Most Italians, if given their druthers, would opt for fruit or cheese
instead of dessert. Here you can enjoy some extraordinary Red Cow
Parmigiano, from a nearly extinct breed known for its flavorful milk, or

<HD>A 100-Acre Summary of Afghan Needs</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The Afghan government is working as fast as it can to put together
a wish list for donor nations gathering this week in Tokyo. It might be
simpler if the government could bring the donors to the Jangalak
industrial complex on the outskirts of Kabul and let them see what this
nation needs: almost everything.</LD>
<LD>   Jangalak might be viewed as Afghanistan shrunk to 100 acres, available
for viewing--and lamenting--in a day. Before it was turned to moonscape
by the wars of the early 1990s, Jangalak was a factory like few others in
the world, providing materials for virtually every industrial need in the
nation.</LD>
<LD>   Having grown out of a small brick factory and metal works, and further
enlarged by the Soviets during the 1980s, Jangalak manufactured
everything from ball bearings to generators. Its 3,000 workers built
electric transformers, shaped parts for helicopters, and bottled ether
for hospitals. Jangalak was the nation's main brick factory, its main
tool shop, its only manufacturer of car bodies, its only semimodern
lumber mill.</LD>
<TE>   Today, only 150 workers still have jobs, most as guards who keep a
lookout for squatters. The other workers perform a single manufacturing
task: melting the few remaining, ruined engine blocks down into small
balls of steel to be sold as measuring weights.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of reconstructing Jangalak to a point where it could turn out
at least a few more sophisticated products, according to the Ministry of
Planning, is about $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the rest of the country--more than 4,500 miles of paved
roads that need to be repaired or rebuilt, at costs ranging from $40,000
a mile to $155,000 a mile; 210,000 civil servants and 25,000 police
officers who haven't been paid in six months and need about $35 million
just to catch up; a heater for the battered presidential palace, where
the temperature inside was about 45 degrees when Secretary of State Colin
L. Powell met with interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates vary, but several government officials and international aid
agencies say 75% to 85% of Afghanistan's infrastructure has been damaged
to the point of uselessness or destroyed during more than two decades of
war.</TE>
<TE>   "When we are born, we are fed by the breast of our mother, and so we
know who our mother is," said Abdul Qudus, 55, a guard at Jangalak whose
face seems permanently set in a sad smile. For 25 years, he worked the
looms in one of the weaving buildings here, before they were destroyed
and looted along with the rest of the complex by moujahedeen warlords.
"The bastards who did this didn't recognize their own mother.</TE>
<TE>   "This," he said, opening his arms to the destruction, "was their
mother."</TE>
<TE>   Disagreements have risen already as to how much money is needed--and
over how long a period--to rebuild Afghanistan. Planning Minister Haji
Mohammed Mukhaqiq raised eyebrows when he placed the 10-year total at $45
billion. Many in the interim government here, as well as at the World
Bank and United Nations, say the amount should be closer to $10 billion
or $15 billion, of which $100 million is needed urgently.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years and $15 billion, however, would be just the beginning,
everyone agrees, even if peace prevails--by no means a certainty at this
point. With an ongoing war and a brand-new government, Afghanistan is
certain to face hard questions at the gathering Monday and Tuesday in
Tokyo about whether it can handle massive donations properly, keeping the
money from being siphoned by warlords or eventually going to fund more
factional fighting.</TE>
<TE>   As it prepares to defend itself, Karzai's nascent administration also
is trying to determine what needs rebuilding, what needs replacing, what
needs improving. Very few things, down to the mine-littered earth itself,
don't fit into one of those categories.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to know, however, where to begin.</TE>
<TE>No Phones, No Surprise</TE>
<TE>   There isn't a single phone in all of Jangalak. This would come as no
surprise to any Afghan. Kabul, the capital, is the only place in the
country with working telephones. There are an estimated 100 to 150 of
them--in a city of 1.2 million to 1.8 million people. The telephones
function perhaps 5% or 10% of the time, and can ring only one another,
not, say, a phone across the border in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Jangalak once had more than 100 buildings, some with massive lighted
signs reading "Boiler Room" or "Tool and Die." There was a movie theater,
a guest house, even a saloon back when alcohol was allowed in this
Islamic state. Of all the light fixtures in the sprawling complex, two
remain unbroken. Even if their electrical connections weren't severed,
the bulbs would probably light for only about 2 1/2 hours a day, the
average dose of power here.</TE>
<TE>   Money for communications and power improvements will be among
Afghanistan's top requests in Tokyo. Another will be for money to build
or rebuild homes so that 5 million refugees can return. The first efforts
are planned for neighborhoods near Jangalak, on the west side of Kabul,
and on the Shomali plain, north of the city.</TE>
<TE>   In the western and southern parts of Kabul, about 40,000 homes were
destroyed during the fighting in the 1990s between moujahedeen
commanders, Reconstruction Minister Mohammed Amin Farhang said. On the
Shomali plain, Taliban forces had taken charge of the demolition,
leveling an estimated 50,000 mostly mud-brick homes in a scorched-earth
effort to deny any advantage to their Northern Alliance rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "We must have houses," Farhang said, "or our people won't come home."</TE>
<TE>   Farhang, an economist in Germany for the last 20 years, is one of many
ministers to return from abroad to help rebuild his homeland. He lives in
Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel, by far the most luxurious in Afghanistan.
He uses a bucket of water to flush his toilet, has bullet holes in his
windows and in the morning steps into a lobby where the temperature has
often dropped below freezing.</TE>
<TE>   Farhang knows his situation is infinitely better than that of the
people he is trying to help. Among them is 40-year-old Omara Khan, who
returned one recent day to his home on the Shomali plain, a village
called Bagareq-e-Chinar, with his wife and eight children.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so happy to be back in my village, I am going to lie in the
dirt," Khan declared with glee before stretching out on a flat swath of
earth. When asked which of the roofless, burned-out homes nearby was his,
Khan looked up from where he lay: "This is my home. It's not here now,
but I am lying where my bed was."</TE>
<TE>   Like 85% of Afghans, Khan was a subsistence farmer, growing potatoes
and onions. The Taliban, however, had mined much of the fields around
Bagareq-e-Chinar, destroyed irrigation canals, and poisoned the wells,
most of which produce little, if any, water after three years of drought.
As a result, assistance with agricultural projects is also high on the
government's priorities list.</TE>
<TE>   The village and Jangalak are like many parts of the country in that
they were not only devastated during battles but also plundered when the
firing stopped.</TE>
<TE>Last of the Giant Cranes</TE>
<TE>   Jangalak had 150 giant crane systems. One is left. Pakistan-funded
warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his men took the rest, everyone around
says, selling them in Pakistan to buy more weapons. They took the steel
structural supports, piping and water tanks, and stripped the copper wire
out of virtually every electrical item. They took the tools, the dies,
the new bricks and lumber, the shelving and faucets and forklifts. They
took almost everything and destroyed what they couldn't remove.</TE>
<TE>   About the only items Hekmatyar's men neither stole nor damaged were 70
giant water and fuel tanks, the guards at Jangalak say. When the Taliban
forces seized power in 1996, they sold the tanks in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "You name it, they need it," said Ahmed Fawzi, spokesman for the U.N.
special envoy to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood around the Jangalak factory, also known as Jangalak,
once had two elementary schools. Both are gone. With so many teachers
having left the country, and with women not allowed to teach under the
Taliban and girls not allowed in schools, the student-teacher ratio
nationwide is now about 200 to 1, according to the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   In Bamian province west of here, there is a health clinic for men but
none for women. In the western city of Herat, almost all the power lines
that once delivered electricity have been snapped. In some remote
villages of Balkh province in the north, people are eating bread made
largely of dry grass.</TE>
<TE>   At Jangalak, a 14-year-old boy named Gulbuddin grazes his family's 20
goats among the bomb craters and detritus. He began bringing them here,
he said, after a cow and seven goats were blown up by mines in the hills
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Qudus, the guard, hasn't been paid in several months, he said,
but he comes to work in the hope that he'll be paid soon. He also comes
because he loves this place.</TE>
<TE>   "With my whole heart," he said, patting his chest. "Afghans don't like
to ask for things from other people. Today, we have to ask for help."</TE>

<HD>Emirates Looked Other Way While Al Qaeda Funds Flowed</HD>
<DH>Finance: For years the Persian Gulf country shrugged off warnings
from U.S. officials about money laundering.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDY PASTERNAK</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until Sept. 11, Osama bin Laden's terrorists in Afghanistan used
the Persian Gulf crossroads of the United Arab Emirates as their lifeline
to the outside world. Poor oversight in the loose federation of seven
tiny sheikdoms allowed Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and Taliban agents to
set up clandestine arms-trading and money-laundering operations,
according to accounts from American, United Nations, Afghan and U.A.E.
sources.</LD>
<LD>   In the emirate of Sharjah, Afghan-based militants linked up with
Victor Bout, a Russian arms dealer accused of repeatedly violating United
Nations weapon sanctions. And millions in Al Qaeda funds cascaded through
the freewheeling financial institutions of the neighboring emirate of
Dubai. Terrorists used a Somali warlord's money exchange, an Islamic bank
once headed by the emirates' finance minister and currency houses that
touted their ability to wire $1 million abroad overnight.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. investigation into the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon already has exposed trails leading back to the
U.A.E. More than $120,000 was channeled through emirate bank accounts to
suicide pilot Mohamed Atta and other suspected hijackers.</LD>
<TE>   The suicide attacks finally prompted U.A.E. officials to crack down on
Al Qaeda and its front ventures. But the sudden burst of urgency followed
years of passivity.</TE>
<TE>   The U.A.E. was one of only three countries that maintained diplomatic
relations with the now-toppled Taliban regime. Despite quiet but
persistent prodding by U.S. and other Western diplomats, the emirates'
ruling elite was hesitant to reckon with the growing terrorist presence.
Regulations that would target terrorists would also interfere with a
laissez-faire economy that has bolstered the wealth of their entwined
desert kingdoms.</TE>
<TE>   Strategically located between the Arabian Peninsula and South Asia,
the emirates' oil-rich confederation is barely 30 years old, a
cash-stoked economic wonderland. The emirates are one of the world's
busiest sea and air trade hubs, where both legal and illicit freight
travels on ancient dhow sailing ships and aging Soviet-era cargo planes.</TE>
<TE>   The emirates' rapid economic progress won admiration from American
officials. But the U.S. also grew concerned as prominent entrepreneurs
forged financial ties with Islamic militants.</TE>
<TE>   The emirates "moved much too slowly and without adequate dedication to
really putting controls into place," said Jonathan Winer, a former deputy
assistant secretary of State for international law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. pressed the emirates for tighter banking controls but moved
delicately, not wanting to offend an ally in an already-complicated
relationship. The emirates allow U.S. naval ships to berth in its harbors
but also oppose America's pro-Israel tilt.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the U.A.E. government, Central Bank and airports in the
emirates of Sharjah and Dubai all insisted that the emirates have been
vigilant foes of terrorism. "The U.A.E. has been consistent in its
cooperation," a Ministry of Information spokesman said. All of the U.A.E.
officials declined to be identified by name.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities publicly compliment the emirates on a stepped-up
campaign against terrorism since Sept. 11. "I think they get it and are
truly being responsive," said R. Richard Newcomb, director of the
Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control. One Western
diplomat based in the emirates said emirate officials "were horrified by
what happened."</TE>
<TE>   But current and former U.S. officials who urged the U.A.E. government
to take action against Al Qaeda before Sept. 11 worry about the
durability of the new commitment.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the two months after the Sept. 11 attacks, "we certainly have
evidence of money, fees and commissions being directed" to Al Qaeda from
the now-closed exchange run by the Somali warlord, said Jimmy Gurule,
Treasury's head of enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from international finance ministries, the emirates
finally agreed last year to bar their banks and currency exchanges from
concealing funds illegally obtained or meant for criminal purposes,
otherwise known as money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   By then, though, Al Qaeda and Taliban operatives had burrowed deep
inside the emirates. Bin Laden's terrorists found "deep-pocket
contributions, government assistance, charities, banks, couriers and
other ways of making money," said one U.S. official. The emirates'
"assistance" took the form of "preventing information, preventing
action," said one former National Security Council official.</TE>
<TE>   At times, even the emirates' rulers betrayed sympathy for some of Bin
Laden's aims.</TE>
<TE>   One telling comment came during a 1999 meeting in the emirates between
emirate and American officials on the sensitive topic of money
laundering. The session was so important to the U.S. that the request had
come from President Clinton himself, in a letter to the emirates'
president, and in another from Defense Secretary William S. Cohen to his
emirates counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans were intent on blocking Al Qaeda's money in the wake of
its coordinated attacks on two U.S. embassies in east Africa. But a
senior sheik said it would be difficult to distinguish between Al Qaeda
funds used for criminal activities such as the bombings and money meant
for what he viewed as more acceptable training of Islamic rebels in
Bosnia and Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   The visitors were stunned.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a showstopper," said a U.S. official familiar with the
conversation.</TE>
<TE>Planes Suspected in Arms Trafficking</TE>
<TE>   The cargo planes that roar along Sharjah International Airport's lone
runway are discards from the Soviet empire. Battered Antonovs and
Ilyushins fly off every week on freight runs that span from Africa to
Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation buffs from around the world bring their cameras to snap rare
photos of these durable relics. But in the last five years, dozens of the
planes have also drawn the focus of investigators and diplomats looking
into their clandestine role in the flow of weapons to war-torn hot spots.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the government of Swaziland notified the emirates government
that more than two dozen Sharjah-based craft might not be airworthy and
that the operators may have used the planes in arms trafficking. Two of
the companies named were Air Cess and Flying Dolphin, both later
identified by a U.N. report as involved in gun running to Africa.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the alert went out, the two businesses had picked up an
important client outside of Africa: the Taliban, which had placed their
national airline at Al Qaeda's disposal.</TE>
<TE>   The deal came together in Sharjah, at a hotel near the airport in
October 1996, just a month after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Two Russians spent hours in a third-floor room that day with young
Mullah Farid Ahmed, plucked by the Taliban from his Islamic studies to
serve as the emirates' representative for Afghanistan's Ariana Airways.</TE>
<TE>   When the discussion ended, say Afghan and emirates air industry
sources, Ahmed had agreed to depend on Air Cess for wheels, tires and
other military equipment for Taliban air force planes. Flying Dolphin
would provide charter flights when Ariana was unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   Below the surface was another agenda, said an Afghan air expert
familiar with the hotel meeting. Air Cess, the expert said, became a
conduit for arms and ammunition obtained for the Taliban from several
Eastern European countries.</TE>
<TE>   Air Cess, Flying Dolphin and Ariana allegedly came together to support
an air network that delivered poison chemicals, weapons, operatives and
cash to Al Qaeda and the Taliban, according to accounts from U.N., Afghan
and U.S. sources.</TE>
<TE>   Flying Dolphin stepped in after U.S. and U.N. sanctions aimed at
stopping terrorists froze Ariana's assets and took away the Afghan firm's
international landing rights. For two months in late 2000 and early 2001,
a Flying Dolphin Boeing 727 shuttled twice a week to the Taliban
headquarters of Kandahar, Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Air Cess was owned by Bout, a former Soviet air force pilot who has
been accused in U.N. reports of violating weapon embargoes in Angola,
Sierra Leone and Liberia. Flying Dolphin is owned by Sheik Abdullah bin
Zayed al Saqr al Nahyan, who was the emirates' ambassador to the U.S.
from 1989 to 1992. A member of the ruling family of Abu Dhabi, the
dominant emirate, Bin Zayed is described in a U.N. report as "a business
associate of Victor Bout."</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. State Department fact sheet issued in July alleges Bout heads a
fleet of 60 cargo planes staffed by 300 pilots and employees and operates
a shifting roster of companies used for running assault rifles,
ammunition, missile launchers and helicopter gunships to the hot spots.</TE>
<TE>   Repeated attempts to reach Bout through several of the emirate firms
he has owned were unsuccessful. Bin Zayed acknowledged in a telephone
interview that he knew Bout and Ahmed but insisted he did not work with
them and never allowed his planes to be used for smuggling. "If there's
anything happening like this," he said, "it's without my knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed has disappeared and could not be contacted.</TE>
<TE>   A U.N. inquiry team has begun examining whether Bout was involved in
violations of embargoes against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. American
authorities are also investigating reports surfacing since Sept. 11 that
Bout did business with Al Qaeda. In October, they were approached by a
Bout operative who volunteered information about the smuggler's business
ties to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Bout has never been arrested. A former Sharjah airport trade official
familiar with Bout's career disagrees with the picture painted by the
U.N. reports. "He's not the monster they say he is," said Richard
Chichakli, who was manager of the airport's free-trade zone from 1993 to
1996.</TE>
<TE>   From late 1996 on, Afghan and emirates sources said, the volume of
Ariana and charter flights from Sharjah to Kandahar increased to as many
as three to four flights a day. Officials of the newly installed Afghan
government say many of the Ariana planes carried arms to the Taliban and
Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Shipments of chemical poison were also transported on several flights,
said Dr. Ravan Farhadi, the Afghan permanent representative to the U.N.
Citing Afghan and American intelligence reports, Farhadi said cyanide and
other toxic substances purchased in Germany, the Czech Republic and
Ukraine were "channeled through the United Arab Emirates" and flown out
of Sharjah on Ariana cargo runs to Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban, Farhadi said, "had nothing to do with this. These
chemicals were for Bin Laden and his people. It was some of the chemicals
they were using in experiments."</TE>
<TE>   Bout moved his fleet in 1995 to Sharjah from Belgium, where law
enforcement was shadowing him. That same year, the emirate opened its
airport trade zone in a bid to rival Dubai, the nation's passenger hub.
The zone nurtured a booming sea-to-air cargo industry that now moves more
than 500,000 tons of freight a year.</TE>
<TE>   The airport boasts on a Web site that its success stems from "the
'laissez-faire' attitude of the concerned governmental authorities such
as Security, Immigration and Customs."</TE>
<TE>   A U.A.E. spokesman said any arrangements among Air Cess, Flying
Dolphin and Ariana were none of his government's business "as long as
they are in accordance with [U.A.E.] laws and international standards." A
Sharjah airport spokesman insisted that "there is no possibility that
illegal goods are loaded or unloaded at Sharjah airport."</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, Chichakli said, Sharjah security restricted cargo
loading to a monitored indoor facility, a move designed to prevent
smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   But Abdul Shukoor Arefee, a former Ariana technical crewman who flew
regularly into Sharjah in 1996 and 1997, said Afghan planes would "park
in isolated places" outside the loading zone, often at night. Watching
crates hefted aboard in the dark, he said, he wondered "what they had in
those boxes."</TE>
<TE>   Ariana, Air Cess, Ahmed and Bout faced no pressure to curtail their
operations until 1999, when the U.S. and U.N. began imposing sanctions on
Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The emirates complied with the Ariana sanctions
in 2000, but the Taliban's business contacts in Sharjah found ways to
keep flying.</TE>
<TE>   In late 2000, Flying Dolphin applied to the U.N. to take over Ariana's
closed routes. Despite their own reports linking Flying Dolphin to arms
smuggling, U.N. officials did not oppose the request.</TE>
<TE>   Flying Dolphin's flights to Kandahar were usually half-filled with
deported Afghan laborers and relief supplies, such as food and medicine,
Bin Zayed said.</TE>
<TE>   But on Jan. 19, 2001, the U.N. halted the shuttle. Its investigators
suspect some of the Flying Dolphin flights may have also carried
contraband.</TE>
<TE>   "If that was so," Bin Zayed asked, "why did they give me permission? I
went to them and said, 'Gentlemen, I want to fly.' I waited two months.
Then they wrote me a letter and told me to stop. I really had no clue
what was the reason."</TE>
<TE>   By last year, U.N. teams were also trying to interview emirates
officials about Bout's alleged weapon flights from Sharjah--first to
African states and then to the Taliban. The teams were alternately
rebuffed, delayed and aided grudgingly.</TE>
<TE>   When a panel exploring Bout's role in violating an arms embargo in
Angola visited the emirates in early 2000, Mohamed Al-Gaith, the
emirates' director-general of civil aviation, told them he had no
indication that Bout's firms had transported arms using planes based in
Sharjah.</TE>
<TE>   On a second visit in 2001, the U.N. team pressed for a close-up look
at Bout's planes, employees and other firms suspected of arms trading.
Emirates officials told the team they would have to "leave the country,"
then restricted them to a brief jeep tour of the Sharjah airport escorted
by a U.A.E. intelligence official, said Johan Peleman, a Belgium arms
trafficking expert who served on both panels and a subsequent one.</TE>
<TE>   Returning six months ago, this time investigating the trail of weapons
to Liberia, the U.N. panel was allowed to inspect Bout's planes and
interview his brother, Serguei, who insisted Bout no longer runs Air
Cess.</TE>
<TE>   When a new panel pushed for a visit to Sharjah to check whether the
Afghan embargo was working, emirates officials offered to meet, but not
before the team's term had expired. An emirates government spokesman said
"there has been no denial" of help, but Peleman concluded that "the
Afghanistan sanctions issue is much more sensitive to the U.A.E. than any
African conflict."</TE>
<TE>   The emirates' cooperation likely will be tested again in the next few
weeks. A new U.N. team is preparing to ask for a return visit to
Sharjah--and for emirates officials' aid in their inquiry into Afghan
sanctions violations and the involvement of Ariana, Air Cess and Flying
Dolphin.</TE>
<TE>   There are signs U.S. pressure may have paved their way.</TE>
<TE>   At the urging of American officials, the emirates early last year
halted the flights of almost all foreign-registered aircraft in Sharjah.
Planes already registered in Russia were exempted--and some, Peleman
said, may be among those used in the arms trade.</TE>
<TE>   The emirates also began requiring Sharjah's cargo carriers to install
expensive airborne collision avoidance systems on all of their planes.
The goal, a former National Security Council official said, was to drive
up Bout's costs and "drive him away."</TE>
<TE>   Bout moved--but not far. According to Peleman, he has relocated
operations to the neighboring emirates of Ajmaan and Ras al Khaima--but
one U.A.E. cargo handler said some Air Cess planes are still on the
ground in Sharjah.</TE>
<TE>   Flying Dolphin has returned to its charter flights to the Far East and
Europe, Bin Zayed said. And after three months of U.S. air attacks that
decimated its fleet, Ariana has made a shaky return to service, though it
uses a lone Antonov solely for domestic flights in western Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Some U.S. officials wonder if they might have done more early on to
stem arms trade between Sharjah and Afghanistan. Their dilemma, a former
NSC aide said, was that, as vexing as the weapon pipeline was, there was
an even larger terrorism priority in the emirates: Al Qaeda's movement of
vast amounts of illicit cash.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we didn't push harder [on Bout] is that we had to
prioritize," the official said. "The money was a bigger one."</TE>
<TE>BCCI Scandal Was First Warning Sign</TE>
<TE>   Dubai is the emirates' capital of cash. Businesspeople bring in
suitcases stuffed with currency. Credit cards and checks are rarities,
and there are ample reasons to keep stacks of bills on hand: The airport
duty-free zone, with the world's cheapest prices on liquor, electronics
and jewelry. A hotel in the shape of a billowing dhow sail, where
two-story rooms, complete with butler, go for $15,000 a night. An
underwater seafood restaurant reached by a two-minute ride on a
submarine.</TE>
<TE>   But the most important industry in Dubai is banking, in every
form--from the age-old hawala, which moves money informally on an honor
system, to the high-tech offshore branches of foreign banks. Al Qaeda
used them all.</TE>
<TE>   For years before the Sept. 11 attacks, the process of rooting out Al
Qaeda's seams of money in the emirates was filled with frustration for
the emirates and the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   From the emirates' perspective, no rules were being broken. The
government collects no income tax, so there seemed to be little reason to
keep tabs on who was getting what, especially when the lack of money
controls made the economy so strong. The U.S. saw in the emirates a
nation passive in the face of an urgent problem. "They don't do anything
on their own," said Winer, the State Department official.</TE>
<TE>   The first hints of trouble in the emirates' go-go financial attitude
came with the 1991 collapse of the Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce
International. BCCI was accused of using depositors' money to cover as
much as $15 billion in mistakes, payoffs and bad debts. The ruling family
of Abu Dhabi, the dominant emirate, owned 77% of the bank.</TE>
<TE>   "BCCI did dirty work for every major terrorist service in the world,"
said Jack Blum, a Washington money-laundering expert who was a counsel to
the U.S. Senate committee that investigated the case. But, he added,
"there's a substantial amount that wasn't learned" from the experience.</TE>
<TE>   The emirates focused in BCCI's aftermath on preventing bank fraud, not
on the way banks get used by criminal organizations, Blum said.</TE>
<TE>   The emirates were quick to comply when the U.S. asked in 1998 that
some Taliban accounts be closed at Dubai Islamic Bank. The bank's
chairman, Mohammed Khalfan bin Kharbash, is also the U.A.E. minister for
financial and industrial affairs.</TE>
<TE>   But the country did not pass laws that would help prevent or unearth
other similar situations. The emirates "considered money laundering to be
a drug problem," Winer said. "And as illegal drugs aren't much of a
problem in the U.A.E., the U.A.E. always felt it didn't have a
money-laundering problem, no matter what we said."</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, U.S. officials urged U.A.E. authorities to impose
reporting requirements on hawalas.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, the U.S. government had been investigating a hawala
called Al Barakaat for nearly two years. Al Barakaat catered to Somalis
abroad who wanted to send money home. Though the expatriates lived in the
U.S. and Western Europe, the last stop before Somalia was always Al
Barakaat's global headquarters in Dubai, where an estimated $25 million a
year in handling and money-exchange fees were skimmed off for Bin Laden's
group, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed Nur Ali Jim'ale, the network's founder, is a "member of the
kitchen cabinet" of Bin Laden, said a Bush administration official.
Jim'ale, a Somali warlord, started the business in 1989, the same year
Bin Laden created Al Qaeda. Jim'ale later opposed the presence of
American troops in his homeland, and Bin Laden took credit for helping to
stir tribal resistance there.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until Nov. 7 that the emirates moved against Al Barakaat.
Emirates agents raided the hawala's office and bank, allowing American
investigators to pore over seized records. The move was "a template for
our ambitions" to work together, a U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Jim'ale, still in the emirates, has not been questioned, a Central
Bank spokesman said, because judicial authorities "are awaiting evidence"
from other countries. Jim'ale is contesting the freezing of the hawala's
assets. The bank spokesman says of terrorist financing through Al
Barakaat: "We believe it did not exist."</TE>
<TE>   In the years preceding the terrorist attacks, American frustration had
been mounting. It seemed as if "we spend countless hours cajoling,
begging, urging for money-laundering laws, and it never happens," said a
former NSC official.</TE>
<TE>   So the U.S. sought outside help in 2000, from an international group
of treasury departments known as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
"What we did was we got 29 other countries to join us in threatening
sanctions," said William Wechsler, who tracked terrorist finances for the
National Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   In a confidential report to its members in February 2000, the task
force conspicuously mentioned that in the emirates "there is essentially
no anti-money-laundering" activity. The slight irritated U.A.E. rulers.
They summoned the U.S. ambassador to complain.</TE>
<TE>   The emirates were now on notice that the task force would be deciding
whether to limit the country's access to Western banks. But the
terrorists were moving faster than the task force.</TE>
<TE>   In June 2000, Marwan Al-Shehhi received $4,790, wired to Manhattan
from the emirates. Al-Shehhi would later help hijack United Airlines
Flight 175, which flew into the south tower of the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   The next month, federal court records show, $9,485 was wired from the
emirates into a Florida SunTrust bank account in the names of Al-Shehhi
and Mohamed Atta, the leader of the hijacking operation.</TE>
<TE>   While those transactions stayed under a $10,000 limit designed to
trigger a "suspicious activity report" from banks to the federal
government, others did not. On Aug. 30, 2000, $19,985 was wired from the
emirates to the SunTrust account of Al-Shehhi and Atta. On Sept. 18,
2000, $69,985 was wired from the emirates to that account.</TE>
<TE>   If the emirates had already put money-laundering laws in place, the
sender in the emirates likely would have had to provide identification
and an address--information that might have scared off the supplier or
sped up any investigation of the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 14, 2000, the emirates issued a regulation to all banks,
money-changers, finance companies and other monetary institutions
operating in the country. Managers and employees were "obliged personally
to report a transaction aimed at money laundering to" a government unit
in Abu Dhabi.</TE>
<TE>   American officials were unimpressed. "The enforcement part is nil,"
Winer said.</TE>
<TE>   By June, Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi used a cash deposit to open an
account at a Dubai branch of the London-based Standard Chartered Bank. He
would later be tagged "the paymaster" of the Sept. 11 operation. The same
day, Fayez Rashid Ahmed Hassan Al Qadi Banihammad used a cash deposit to
open savings and checking accounts at the same branch, federal court
documents show. He would join Al-Shehhi aboard United Flight 175.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer, as the FATF began considering sanctions against the
emirates, the emirates asked the U.S. for help in getting more time to
enact a money-laundering law. They also made an offer: If the U.S.
provided information about Bout's bank accounts, they would crack down on
his assets to prove the emirates could be effective.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 8, the top banking authorities of Oman and the emirates held
a news conference to announce that they would enact laws to combat money
laundering by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The hijackers were already returning their unused funds. On the day of
the news conference, Mohamed Atta wired at least $7,860 back to Mustafa
Ahmed in the emirates. The next day, hijacker Waleed M. Alshehri wired
$5,000 to "Ahamad Mustafa" in the emirates. The day after that, Al-Shehhi
wired $5,400 to "Mustafa Ahmad" in the emirates.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, about $16,300 was deposited into Mustafa Ahmed
al-Hawsawi's Dubai bank account. He moved $6,534 from Fayez Ahmed's
account using a check signed and dated Sept. 10. He withdrew most of the
remaining money with an ATM card.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda's money was on the move again.</TE>

<HD>Enron Is Proving Costly to Economy</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy: Energy projects valued at $12 billion are on hold as
financial markets make it tougher to raise capital. Any shortages would
fall heavily on consumers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES FLANIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SENIOR ECONOMICS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The collapse of Enron Corp., so far a political, legal and investor
crisis, is now imposing widespread costs on the U.S. economy, according
to a range of companies, energy experts and bankers.</LD>
<LD>   Electricity and natural gas companies are facing higher costs.
Projects to build power plants, pipelines and transmission lines are
being put on hold. And in all sections of the economy, companies with
high debts are feeling the pinch of tighter credit.</LD>
<LD>   More than $12 billion of investment in new power plants has been
postponed in recent weeks as financial markets, unnerved by Enron's
sudden descent into bankruptcy, have effectively raised the cost of
capital for energy projects. Plans to develop natural gas deposits also
are being cut back dramatically.</LD>
<TE>   Ultimately, if these cutbacks result in power shortages and higher
costs in future years, the burden will fall on consumers, according to
energy experts.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the recession and mild winter weather are reducing demand
for energy. But Enron's demise is playing a role, experts say, as lenders
and credit rating firms are taking a hard look at corporate debt levels
and forcing many to cut back spending plans and sell assets to improve
their balance sheets.</TE>
<TE>   That reaction in financial markets may have been unforeseen by the
Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's chief economic advisor, and his
staff studied Enron in the months before its Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing to
gauge the potential effects of its collapse on markets for natural gas
and for stocks, bonds and currencies.</TE>
<TE>   "Lindsey found the impact on other markets was a nonevent," Ari
Fleischer, White House press secretary, said Wednesday. (Before joining
the Bush administration, Lindsey was a paid consultant to Enron.)</TE>
<TE>   Some businesspeople have a different view. "Enron is affecting the
whole U.S. economy, particularly the energy industry," said analyst
Christopher Ellinghaus of Williams Capital Co., a New York investment
firm. "At a time when the U.S. needs to improve its energy infrastructure
with transmission lines and power plants, the Enron case has changed the
credit market's whole view of debt and put off projects," Ellinghaus
said.</TE>
<TE>   The very decline of Enron stock from more than $90 a share to 50 cents
a share in a single year has taken a massive $67 billion of shareholder
wealth out of the economy. Many employees and former employees at Enron
face meager retirements.</TE>
<TE>   Also, other energy companies have suffered losses in the hundreds of
millions of dollars because of their relationships to Enron, either
through contracts or loans. Major banks such as Citigroup and J.P. Morgan
Chase have so far acknowledged losses in the hundreds of millions and the
potential for billions of dollars more.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to put the cost in precise terms, Joseph Tovey, a New York
investment banker specializing in energy issues, said that "at a wild
guess I would say Enron's collapse adds one-half of 1% to the cost of
capital for the energy industry," a calculation that translates to
roughly $4 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   Spread across the vast complexes of the oil, gas and electricity
industries, with more than $1 trillion in annual revenues, such a sum may
not seem like much. But the higher costs are enough to affect independent
producers of natural gas and investments by even well-financed electric
companies.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Entergy Corp., a large New Orleans-based firm that
supplies electricity throughout the central United States and to Latin
America, Europe and Australia, has just postponed power plant ventures in
Ohio and Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   TECO Energy Inc. of Tampa, Fla., is cutting spending by $700 million,
postponing three power plants. Calpine Corp. of San Jose said last week
it was cutting planned expenditures by $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Cancellations of such projects may not cause shortages of power and
natural gas in the current economic environment, although cutbacks in
investment are not helping the economy recover from recession.</TE>
<TE>   When the Bush administration dismissed the threat of an Enron failure,
it was focused on short-term effects on markets. But the more important
effect of Enron's collapse "is in the longer term," said James S.
Pignatelli, chief executive of Unisource Energy Corp., the holding
company of Tucson Electric Co.</TE>
<TE>   When the economy recovers and use of electricity resumes a 3% annual
growth rate, power shortages and higher energy prices could be "the price
we pay for Enron," Pignatelli said.</TE>
<TE>   To see why, it is necessary to understand the service that Enron, at
its best, provided. In a phrase, Enron "made markets."</TE>
<TE>   It bought and sold natural gas and electricity on contracts with
durations as long as a decade and contracted to supply all of the energy
needs of large companies and institutions, such as the University of
California and California State University systems and the Catholic
Archdiocese of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Its massive market-making allowed customers to buy energy in tailored
packages. Enron often was offering a lower price than the local utility,
thanks to high volume.</TE>
<TE>   The company, no less than the dot-coms and Internet firms in
technology, was a standard-bearer for an era that took an expansive view
of industrial possibilities and a liberal view of finance.</TE>
<TE>   Enron was part of a process that enabled more power plants to be built
in recent years than had been commissioned in previous decades, said John
Rowe, president of Exelon Corp., a Chicago-based firm that distributes
electricity to Illinois and Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Now Enron's bankruptcy increases "the risks and uncertainty in the
business," Rowe said. It threatens to end a decades-long movement to
deregulate and restructure energy industries, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Deregulation, the setting up of competitive markets for electricity
generation and marketing, was not the disaster elsewhere that it proved
to be in California. Newly competitive arrangements, under cautious state
supervision in Ohio, Pennsylvania and other states, helped to bring down
electricity rates in most parts of the country over the last decade and a
half.</TE>
<TE>   But deregulation in California led to ballooning energy prices, which
so far have been paid for by bankrupt or crippled utilities and by the
state government. In deregulation's wake, California is burdened with
electricity prices that are far more than what neighboring states pay for
power.</TE>
<TE>   California's failure stalled the deregulation experiment's progress in
other states. Now with the bankruptcy of Enron, deregulation will be put
off for years, experts say. The experiment has lost its champion. "Enron
lobbied in every state for deregulation," Unisource's Pignatelli said.
"No other company is going to do that."</TE>
<TE>   The financing and administration of electric power will retreat to
older ways: somewhat more regulations, less freely available finance,
according to Pignatelli.</TE>
<TE>   A period of "muddling through" will last at least a year, said analyst
Steven Fleishman of Merrill Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   Easily available finance and expansion may not return soon. Enron's
downfall also "has eroded trust," said Clinton Vince, a Washington-based
attorney with Sullivan &amp; Worcester LLP, a law firm that represents
municipal and cooperative electric companies. "There is a cost for lack
of trust in interest rates charged and business that doesn't get done,"
Vince said.</TE>
<TE>   But such periods are seldom permanent, analysts note, and other
companies--such as Duke Energy, American Electric Power, Dynegy and
Williams Cos.--already are taking over some of the contract trading that
Enron specialized in.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, which continues to operate at a minimal level in bankruptcy, is
still fulfilling contracts, supplying electricity to seven UC campuses
and 19 of the 23 Cal State campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The universities are negotiating with Enron over a two-year extension
on those contracts, which another firm could acquire from the failed
company.</TE>
<TE>   But other traders are unlikely to be as expansive as Enron was in the
variety and size of deals it undertook, energy experts say. But then,
some of Enron's expansiveness was based on spurious accounting and
fictional financing.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's secret partnerships to hide debt and inflate reported profits
have left fears and misgivings in credit markets that are now hobbling
many economic sectors, analysts and investment bankers say.</TE>
<TE>   Enron has even sullied the international reputation of U.S. capital
markets. "It's no shining city on the hill," Stephan Richter, publisher
of the Globalist, said of the U.S. financial system. Richter's online
newsletter is distributed widely in Europe.</TE>

<HD>Visions of Gold Melting for Sellers of Salt Lake</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Broker's tickets go begging as the Games near. And hotels
and homeowners are facing empty rooms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Nineteen days from the opening of the 2002 Winter Games, Olympic
riches are blowing along the slopes of the Wasatch Mountains like a
capricious blizzard--piled up head-high here, blown clear there.</LD>
<LD>   While these Olympics have set a record for ticket revenue, independent
brokers are selling tickets at a loss, downtown hotels are losing
thousands of reservations, homeowners can't find visitors to rent their
houses and local ski resorts complain that the Games have scared away
business.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest winner so far in the run for the gold is the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee, which has sold $173 million in tickets, more than
double the record spent four years ago in Nagano, Japan.</LD>
<TE>   Organizers report selling 88% of the 1.6 million tickets for Olympic
events, including virtually all of the $885 tickets for the prized
opening ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how many of those tickets were purchased by speculators
when tickets went on sale two years ago. In Utah, it's legal to resell
tickets for a profit. Citing reasons ranging from the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon to the economic
downturn to people put off by the high prices, brokers last week said
they are scrambling to sell their inventories.</TE>
<TE>   Various brokers were offering opening ceremony tickets at $150 to $200
below face value.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many tickets available, it's cutthroat," ticket broker
Steve Sadiq said. "I'm getting calls from lots of sellers, but there
aren't enough buyers. These sellers originally thought they'd make a
killing, but it's the other way around."</TE>
<TE>   Another local broker, Stan Johnson, said speculators counted on people
making last-minute decisions to attend the Games. "And there may have
been a lot of undecided people out there. But that was before 9/11. That
made up their minds not to come."</TE>
<TE>   Empty rooms are turning up at prime downtown hotels, as corporate
sponsors reduce their post-Sept. 11 entertainment budgets and
international news media cut back because of the cost of covering
hostilities in Afghanistan. The Olympic organizing committee itself
released 5,000 of the 20,000 rooms it had reserved for sponsors and
others.</TE>
<TE>   Last-minute visitors easily can book choice rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew this would happen--that as the Games drew closer, we'd have
more and more rooms come available," said Rip Rippetoe, executive
director of the city's Visitor Information Service, which offers
reservations assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "Sponsors and other corporations reserved blocks of rooms several
years ago, to save them for their Olympics hospitality programs,"
Rippetoe said. "But then, when it comes down to budget time and they
better know what they actually need or can afford, they whittle down
their reservations."</TE>
<TE>   Hotels that bumped up their rates now are reducing prices. Other
hotels that six months ago demanded minimum stays--including some for the
entire 17-day run of the Olympics--are releasing rooms for shorter
periods.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire hotel market is like Jell-O," Rippetoe said.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners also have widely failed to cash in on the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   About 800 people had listed homes--from humble city houses to opulent
mountain chalets-- through the official Olympic real estate agent, asking
as much as $5,000 a night. By late last week, fewer than half had been
reserved, and typically at reduced prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Like they found out in Atlanta [during the 1996 Summer Olympics],
renting your home is not a way to make a million dollars," said Caroline
Shaw, chief spokeswoman for the SLOC. "Consumers are smart. They know
what the going rates are for rooms."</TE>
<TE>   Operators of ski lodges and condominiums complain that they are having
difficulty filling rooms, even at regular seasonal rates.</TE>
<TE>   "People think all of the resorts are involved in the Olympics, and
they're staying clear of us," said Nathan Rafferty, spokesman for Ski
Utah, a marketing association for 14 ski resorts. "But if they were to
come to these other resorts, they wouldn't even know the Olympics were in
town."</TE>
<TE>   He said regular customers are rescheduling their vacations, partly to
avoid anticipated congestion at the Salt Lake City airport. Rafferty
called it "the Olympics backlash."</TE>
<TE>   At Gold Miner's Daughter, an 80-room lodge at the Alta ski resort area
outside Salt Lake City, 20 rooms at regular seasonal rates remain
available during Presidents Day weekend, which falls after the opening of
the Olympics. Normally, the lodge is sold out.</TE>
<TE>   Such hits to the local economy during an otherwise financial
bonanza--called "leakage"--were anticipated by Olympic planners. Clearly,
for instance, the city could not accommodate its usual convention
business.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a net gain to our state economy because of the Games,
but hosting the Olympics can be disruptive," said Natalie Gochnour, Gov.
Mike Leavitt's deputy for policy issues. "We anticipate a pause in our
economy after the Games, and during the Games there will be disruptions
to local business."</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics are projected to contribute $2.1 billion to the state's
economy, including the $1.3 billion organizers are spending to stage the
Games. About $400 million has been spent on public works projects, and
the anticipated 70,000 daily visitors are expected to spend $350 million
more.</TE>
<TE>   The local losses from the Sept. 11 attacks are hard to measure, though
the effect on the overall travel and tourism industry is well documented.</TE>
<TE>   The owner of Jet Set Sports, the official Olympics travel agent for
domestic sales, said that, of the 11 Olympics he has booked, the 2002
Games have been his most lucrative.</TE>
<TE>   "We've sold 92% of our [travel and hotel ticket] packages, and if we
don't sell the rest, that's fine," Sead Dizdarevic said. Of the 1,400
packages he contracted to sell, 1,155 were purchased by customers before
Sept. 11 and only one of those customers canceled, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian sales have been more heavily affected.</TE>
<TE>   "Prior to Sept. 11, we were ahead of our sales in comparison to Sydney
[Australia] at the same time," said Raija Koski-Bruce, spokeswoman for
Carlson Marketing Group in Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Business slowed so significantly after the attacks that, earlier this
month, the company discounted its packages by 25%, she said. "Our goal
now is to move our inventory."</TE>
<TE>   Ticket sales for individual Olympic events averaged about $150,000 a
day before Sept. 11, said Mitt Romney, president of the SLOC. Immediately
after the attacks, they dropped to $10,000 a day but have grown steadily
since--to $100,000 a day in December, $200,000 a day in January and, last
week, $300,000 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Of 167 events, 76 officially are sold out. The hottest event tickets
are for the men's hockey gold medal round, the most expensive at $450,
and the final nights of figure skating, with the choicest seats going for
$375.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets can be had for as little as $25 for those willing to stand in
the freezing cold to view cross-country skiing and the biathlon, or $20
for indoor, short-track speed skating.</TE>
<TE>   Romney told reporters last week that he expects the pace of ticket
sales to increase once the Games begin.</TE>
<TE>   "And our expectation is that, just like in Sydney [during the 2000
Games], we'll see a lot of last-minute buyers," Romney said. Officials
say, however, that the rush of last-minute buying will be existing
ticket-holders buying more, rather than new visitors arriving in town.</TE>

<HD>SLA Bank Slaying Is Still Seared Into Memories</HD>
<DH>Violence: For some witnesses, the terrors of Myrna Opsahl's slaying
in 1975 have not faded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>As they did every Monday, a group of women from the Carmichael
Seventh-day Adventist Church drove to the bank on Marconi Avenue to count
the money deposited there by church elders after Saturday services.</LD>
<LD>   This time, on April 21, 1975, the volunteers were Bernadine Slackman,
Beatrice Squier and Myrna Opsahl, who carried the cumbersome adding
machine.</LD>
<LD>   According to court documents and witness statements, four young men
and women entered the bank at the same time, one of them holding open the
door for the church women. As Squier turned to thank the man, he pulled a
ski mask over his face. Inside, the robbers drew guns and yelled at
everyone to "get your noses in the carpet."</LD>
<TE>   Minutes later, Opsahl was dying on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knew then that this robbery gone bad in a well-to-do Sacramento
suburb would, a quarter of a century later, resurrect some of the most
notorious radicals of the 1970s, the would-be revolutionaries of the
Symbionese Liberation Army.</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl's death became a mere footnote in the violent escapades of the
SLA, something of which the small gang was suspected but never convicted.</TE>
<TE>   It was an event overshadowed by the kidnapping of newspaper heiress
Patricia Hearst, the assassination of an Oakland school superintendent
and the fiery deaths of six SLA members in South-Central Los Angeles.
Opsahl's case languished so long that the SLA members allegedly
responsible might have assumed law enforcement would never revisit that
Monday morning on Marconi Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   But for Opsahl's family, the survivors and their families, the
memories haven't faded. What had haunted them for years will now be
played out in a courtroom after the events of last week. Until now, their
painful accounts of what happened had been restricted to legal records,
interviews and books.</TE>
<TE>   In California and Oregon, police arrested four middle-aged ex-radicals
on the orders of Sacramento County Dist. Atty. Jan Scully, who said, "Now
is the time to seek justice for Myrna Opsahl."</TE>
<TE>   Facing first-degree murder charges are William Taylor Harris, 56, of
Oakland; his former wife, Emily Montague Harris, 54, of Altadena; Michael
Alexander Bortin, 53, of Portland, Ore.; and Sara Jane Olson, 55, of St.
Paul, Minn., who had been born Kathleen Ann Soliah. A fifth man charged,
54-year-old James William Kilgore, has been a fugitive since 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Those arrested have all asserted innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Police were drawn back into the fading files on Myrna Opsahl's death
by the 1999 arrest of fugitive Olson. She had married a doctor and was a
suburban mother of three.</TE>
<TE>   As the Los Angeles County district attorney's office sought to convict
her for conspiring to plant bombs under two Los Angeles police cars in
1975, investigators dug into the violent escapades of the SLA, including
the bank robbery.</TE>
<TE>   And so on Friday, after Olson was sentenced to 20 years to life in
prison for the attempted bombing of the police cars, she and former SLA
associates were charged with Opsahl's death.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to convict them now of the holdup of the Crocker National Bank
branch will mean going "way, way back in history," warned Emily Harris'
defense attorney at the arraignment in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   But for some people--their numbers are whittled by time--that violent
morning and its aftermath are recalled not as history but as the sound of
guns cocking and robbers cursing, the sight of tear-stained teenagers and
the glazed eyes of a dark-haired woman on a hospital gurney.</TE>
<TE>   Stan Squier, a retired dentist, heard his late mother, Beatrice, tell
of that morning at the bank many times, when she was close enough to
Opsahl to get shotgun wadding blown into her hair.</TE>
<TE>   "When they told everyone to hit the floor," he said, "Myrna was
carrying an adding machine in her hand. She didn't want to drop it, so
she didn't move fast enough."</TE>
<TE>   "That's when they turned and blew her away," Squier said. "My mom,
being a nurse, knew it was fatal. There's a kind of a death gasp when
they're expiring."</TE>
<TE>Witness Still Lives With Trauma</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl, a 42-year-old mother of four, bled to death on the floor
inches from Beatrice Squier. The shotgun embedded nine pellets into her
left side.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Harp was a 21-year-old assistant to the loan department
manager, sitting no more than 20 feet away from Opsahl.</TE>
<TE>   She saw Opsahl enter the bank through its back, south entrance,
directly in front of the robbers.</TE>
<TE>   She heard yelling and stood, turning in the direction of the commotion
in time to see Opsahl get shot.</TE>
<TE>   A masked woman yelled for everyone to lie down, and Harp remembers the
rest of the robbery in sounds: Opsahl's moans; patrons and tellers
screaming and crying; the robbers cursing and cocking their guns. She can
still recall the shuffle and thump of their feet as they tried to jump
over the counter.</TE>
<TE>   "It was extremely chaotic," Harp said. "My face was in the dirt, and I
could hear them yelling and cussing and I kept thinking to myself,
'You're going to do whatever they say. If they say, dance on the counter,
you'll dance on the counter.' "</TE>
<TE>   According to Hearst, who went from SLA victim to participant, Emily
Harris, Olson, Bortin and Kilgore entered the bank. William Harris and
Steven Soliah, Olson's brother, stood outside as armed lookouts, while
Hearst and Wendy Yoshimura drove getaway cars.</TE>
<TE>   After the robbery, Harp went into the bank's kitchen to get paper
towels in a futile attempt to staunch Opsahl's wounds.</TE>
<TE>   In an era before grief counselors and emergency response teams, Harp
was back at work the next day. What she experienced left a residue of
anger, fear and wariness that has never faded.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't just shoot her that day," she said. "They took part of us
away too."</TE>
<TE>   Her feelings only intensified after prosecutors appeared to shunt
aside her account about a female shooter to focus on Steven Soliah. He
was the only person ever tried for the robbery, and a federal jury
acquitted him in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Soliah, Hearst and Yoshimura cannot be prosecuted because they
were given immunity years ago to testify in grand jury proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Harp said she tried, to no avail, to reignite media interest in the
case when Hearst published an account of her SLA kidnapping in 1982 in
the book "Every Secret Thing."</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1973 by escaped convict Donald DeFreeze, the Symbionese
Liberation Army recruited followers from middle- and upper-middle-class
homes under a slogan: "Death to the fascist insect that preys on the life
of the people."</TE>
<TE>   The group burst into headlines with the November 1973 murder of an
Oakland school superintendent who they mistakenly believed wanted to
require students to show identification on campus.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1974, eight members of the SLA abducted Hearst from her
Berkeley apartment and demanded that the Hearst family feed the poor as
ransom. Three months later, six SLA members holed up in a house near 54th
Street and Compton Avenue died in a firefight with the LAPD. The dead
included Olson's best friend, Angela Atwood.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later in Berkeley, Olson addressed a large crowd, declaring
that SLA members had been "viciously attacked and murdered by 500 pigs."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors may rely heavily upon Hearst's account of her time with
the SLA, detailed in the book and in 1976 police interviews. Hearst said
she drove a getaway car from the bank and that Emily Harris admitted to
accidentally shooting Opsahl.</TE>
<TE>Careless Remarks About the Victim</TE>
<TE>   When Olson asked about the condition of the victim, Hearst's book says
Harris replied, "Oh she's dead, but it really doesn't matter. She was a
bourgeois pig anyway."</TE>
<TE>   According to Hearst's account, Olson also asked who had shot the
woman.</TE>
<TE>   "I did, let's not talk about it," said Emily Harris, according to the
book.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst's account says Kilgore complained that Emily Harris was
careless with her shotgun and had nearly killed him instead of Opsahl.</TE>
<TE>   William Harris brought in part of a shotgun shell, saying, "This is
the murder round."</TE>
<TE>   "If it hadn't been for good old [Myrna]," he said, "one of our
comrades would have been dead."</TE>
<TE>   The same day, Harris buried the remains of the shotgun shell near a
tree in a central Sacramento park where people were feeding ducks,
according to Hearst's account.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Reece, once a good friend of Myrna Opsahl, remembers that day
well.</TE>
<TE>   Both women were married to doctors, and both of those doctors happened
to be making their rounds at American River Hospital when an emergency
call came over the loudspeaker. Both James Reece and Trygve Opsahl rushed
to the emergency room, not knowing the identity of the gunshot victim.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing anybody could do," Carolyn Reece said. "Can you
imagine the shock of finding out that this is your friend and, more
unfortunately, that this poor soul is your beloved, cherished wife?</TE>
<TE>   "I remember how my husband came home devastated from the hospital. I
remember how sick at heart he was. I remember how Trygve looked, I
remember how the children looked. I remember the funeral, the dinner
afterwards and those precious, motherless children.</TE>
<TE>   "I have grieved for her for 27 years. These people were heartless."</TE>

<HD>A Terror Network Unraveled in Singapore</HD>
<DH>Asia: Suspect nabbed in Afghanistan revealed plot to bomb U.S.
targets. Authorities are still searching for explosives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SINGAPORE
</DL>
<LD>The tip-off to perhaps the most ambitious plot by Al Qaeda to kill
Americans that investigators have discovered since Sept. 11 came,
appropriately enough, in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   As war raged there in late November, Northern Alliance forces picked
up Mohammed Aslam bin Yar Ali Khan, a Singaporean of Pakistani descent
who had left Singapore on Oct. 4 to help the Taliban.</LD>
<LD>   Under interrogation, Aslam began to spill details of an effort that
included plans to bomb U.S. warships, airplanes, military personnel and
major U.S. companies in Singapore. Other apparent targets included the
American, Israeli, British and Australian embassies and government
offices there.</LD>
<TE>   Those revelations, bolstered by the CIA's recovery in mid-December of
a grainy videotape and hand-written Arabic notes in the rubble of an Al
Qaeda leader's house in Afghanistan, have stunned U.S. terror experts and
are reverberating across Southeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say the CIA and FBI have sent more agents and
technicians to the region. U.S. intelligence has built what one official
called "all kinds of new monitoring stations" to intercept electronic
communications and other tactical intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have arrested 13 terror suspects in Singapore, 22 in
neighboring Malaysia and four in the Philippines since early December.
More arrests are expected. Officials have seized encrypted computer
disks, surveillance photographs and videos, military maps, night-vision
binoculars, bomb-making manuals, weapons caches and other equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Still missing, along with several key suspects, are 4 tons of ammonium
nitrate that authorities say one of the Singapore terror cells had
acquired. Singapore's internal security police say the group was seeking
to purchase 21 tons of the simple but powerful explosive to build a fleet
of truck bombs. In comparison, Timothy J. McVeigh used 2 tons of ammonium
nitrate and fuel oil to blow up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in
Oklahoma City in April 1995, killing 168 people.</TE>
<TE>   The unraveling of the terrorist network in Singapore, which is still
underway, has raised concerns in Washington that Asia-based terrorists
might be able to evade screening techniques used by U.S. security and
immigration authorities. Those efforts have focused largely on Arabs and
North Africans.</TE>
<TE>   The case provides new evidence that Al Qaeda sought to launch more
attacks: For example, police say two Al Qaeda operatives, one Arab and
the other Indonesian or Filipino, flew into Singapore last October to
advise cell members on building and detonating truck bombs.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a lot of good work involved, as well as a little bit of
luck," a U.S. intelligence official said. "This is a significant case."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Asian officials say Al Qaeda's Southeast Asian cells operated
much like those that were secretly formed to skyjack and crash four U.S.
passenger jets last September, as well as the cells that detonated deadly
truck bombs at two U.S. embassies in East Africa in August 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Singapore cells had trained in Al Qaeda camps in
Afghanistan, the Singaporean government said. Al Qaeda commanders
maintained close control when the cells were activated. At one point,
they even vetoed a proposed attack.</TE>
<TE>   And as in earlier cases, the cells had painstakingly studied potential
targets over a period of years. Although it is unclear when they planned
to strike, the groups clearly sought to hit multiple targets. U.S.
aircraft carriers and other warships increasingly use Singapore for
refueling and resupply, although no U.S. ships and only a few hundred
American military personnel are based there.</TE>
<TE>   Terror experts say Al Qaeda fund-raising and support cells were
believed to be active in the predominantly Muslim nations of Malaysia and
Indonesia. But there was no previous evidence of a network in Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   "This is new and different," said Kenneth B. Katzman, a specialist
with the Congressional Research Service who has studied Al Qaeda for
years. He and other officials said they were surprised by the existence
of the network in Singapore because the island nation maintains powerful
law enforcement and domestic intelligence services.</TE>
<TE>   Singaporean officials say they unraveled the network without foreign
assistance. U.S. intelligence informed Singapore on Dec. 14 of the
videotape found in Afghanistan but did not provide a copy until Dec. 28,
four days after Singapore had made the last arrests.</TE>
<TE>Resident in Singapore Tipped Off Police</TE>
<TE>   The network was studying targets as early as 1997, Singaporean
authorities said, but officials only learned of its existence shortly
after the Sept. 11 attacks when they received a tip from a local
resident.</TE>
<TE>   Officials allege that all 13 members of the Singapore cells belong to
a clandestine organization called the Jemaah Islamiah, or Islamic Group,
which is tied to cells in Indonesia and Malaysia. All reported to a
regional shura, or council, of Al Qaeda leaders in Malaysia's capital,
Kuala Lumpur.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian cell members were from a local extremist group called
Kumpulan Militan Malaysia, or KMM, which appears to have at least an
indirect tie to the Sept. 11 attacks and the October 2000 suicide bombing
in Yemen of the U.S. destroyer Cole.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Sept. 11 skyjackers, Khalid Almihdhar, was videotaped in
January 2000 attending a meeting in Kuala Lumpur with a man later
identified by the CIA as a suspect in the Cole attack. During his visit,
officials said, Almihdhar stayed at an apartment outside the city. Nawaf
Alhazmi, another Sept. 11 skyjacker who traveled with Almihdhar, also may
have stayed there.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the owner of the apartment left for Pakistan last June.
Police tapped his wife's telephone, and he was arrested when he tried to
return home from Thailand on Dec. 9. His interrogation led to the arrests
of 13 suspected Al Qaeda members in Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian police are trying to determine whether the cell also had
links to Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan descent who was
indicted in Virginia last month for his alleged involvement in the Sept.
11 plot. Moussaoui, who carried a phony letter of introduction from a
Malaysian export company when he was arrested in Minnesota in August,
visited Malaysia twice, in September and October 2000, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Most attention in Asia since Sept. 11 has focused not on Malaysia,
Singapore or Indonesia, but on the southern Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Washington announced last week that it would send 650 U.S. commandos
and support troops to help the Philippine military crush Abu Sayyaf, a
local Muslim bandit group that has kidnapped foreigners and Filipinos and
beheaded some of their victims on the island of Mindanao. But terror
cells operating elsewhere in Asia may pose a greater threat than the Abu
Sayyaf.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism is hardly new to Southeast Asia. China provided arms,
training and money to Communist insurgencies in Malaysia, Indonesia and
the Philippines through the 1960s, and radical home-grown movements have
come and gone since.</TE>
<TE>   Now China is quietly sharing intelligence with the CIA on Chinese
Muslims in Afghanistan and is cooperating with U.S. efforts to freeze
terror-linked financial accounts in Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   "They have exchanged intelligence with us on Al Qaeda and terrorism,"
said James R. Lilley, a former U.S. ambassador and CIA station chief in
Beijing. "They're working with us to stop money laundering from Hong
Kong. It's been helpful."</TE>
<TE>   Beijing also sent troops to seal its borders with Afghanistan and
Pakistan to prevent Al Qaeda members from fleeing, Lilley said.</TE>
<TE>   Japan has sent ships to help patrol the Strait of Malacca, a crucial
choke point between Indonesia and Malaysia for oil tankers and other
regional shipping.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say terrorist leader Osama bin Laden's anti-Western,
pan-Islamic message began to take root in Asia in the early 1990s. Key to
the shift was funding from Saudi Arabia for conservative religious
schools, especially in Indonesia, where a tolerant form of Islam has long
prevailed. The schools provided an outlet in a society in which political
opposition was often brutally crushed.</TE>
<TE>   "This has introduced the strict, militant Wahabi form of Islam into a
Muslim environment that is historically very different," said Marvin C.
Ott, a former CIA analyst on East Asia who teaches at the National War
College in Washington. "This is, as far as I can determine, the result of
external forces. And it's very dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Partly as a result, militant Muslims in the region have called for the
creation of a strict Islamic state that would include Malaysia,
Indonesia, the southern Philippines and perhaps Singapore. The foiled
plot against U.S. targets, however, is the first that appears to link the
disparate local groups to Bin Laden's global terror network.</TE>
<TE>   The Singapore plot began to unravel, according to local officials,
when a resident informed the government after Sept. 11 that Aslam, the
Singaporean of Pakistani descent, had links to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   As the investigation gathered steam, Aslam left suddenly for Pakistan,
en route to Afghanistan. His capture and interrogation there provided the
first real clues of the overall plot.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Singaporean Embassy official in Washington, the island
nation's domestic intelligence unit initially knew of only one alleged
cell leader, a 51-year-old condominium manager named Ibrahim Maidin. The
other cell members, the official said, "were relatively unknown and had
to be positively identified."</TE>
<TE>   Maidin, Singapore officials now say, went to Afghanistan for training
in 1993. He later recruited the other cell members in his religious
classes.</TE>
<TE>Attack Plans Were 'Ready for Activation'</TE>
<TE>   According to a statement by Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs, the
suspected terrorists had two "well-developed" plans and several others
that appeared to be under consideration.</TE>
<TE>   The first plan called for an attack on a shuttle bus used to carry
U.S. sailors from the Sembawang wharf in northern Singapore to a nearby
mass transit station.</TE>
<TE>   "The plan was apparently developed and ready for activation," the
ministry statement said. The alleged leader was a 39-year-old printer
named Khalim bin Jaffar, who went to Afghanistan for training between
August 1999 and April 2000. While there, he briefed Al Qaeda superiors on
the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   A videotape recovered in Afghanistan provides a chilling look at the
plan. The images are shaky and amateurish, but the narrator, identified
by Singaporean officials as Hashim bin Abas, a 40-year-old electrical
engineer now in custody, coldly describes how a bomb can be hidden on the
back of a bicycle or motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the place where U.S. military personnels will be dropped off
from a shuttle bus and they will walk toward the MRT [subway] station,"
the narrator says as the video shows a busy intersection. "This is a
temple with about a 1.5-meter-high wall. That is the entrance of the
temple where many vehicles park, so it will not be suspicious to have a
motorcycle or a bicycle there."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Al Qaeda leaders "showed interest in the plan" but
finally nixed it for reasons unknown, the ministry statement said.
Officials speculated that the target was too small.</TE>
<TE>   A second plan called for a bomb attack against U.S. warships along
Singapore's northeastern coastline, between Changi on the island's
eastern tip and the nearby island of Pulau Tekong Besar. A search of
Khalim's possessions after his arrest turned up a Singaporean Defense
Ministry map showing observation posts along the coast and a "kill zone"
marked in the shipping channel.</TE>
<TE>   Also found in Khalim's possession was a list of more than 200 U.S.
companies, including three highlighted as potential targets apparently
because their executives were regarded as "fairly prominent members of
the American community in Singapore." The companies and the individuals
have not been publicly identified.</TE>
<TE>   Another cell used a Singaporean named Andrew Gerard, a 34-year-old
technician at a Singaporean aerospace company, according to local
officials. Gerard, who was born a Roman Catholic but converted to Islam
in 1988, allegedly shot more than 50 digital photographs of U.S.
warplanes at Singapore's Paya Lebar military air base.</TE>
<TE>   The group stepped up its activities after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore officials say an Arab using the code name "Sammy" and a
Filipino or Indonesian code named "Mike" arrived within weeks to help
cell members conduct surveillance of the U.S., Israeli, British and
Australian embassies and government offices, commercial buildings housing
U.S. companies, and Singapore's military headquarters, known as Bukit
Gombak. A videotape of the surveillance was later recovered.</TE>
<TE>   It was Sammy and Mike, Singaporean officials say, who advised the
Singapore cell members that they needed 21 tons of ammonium nitrate and
urged them to "locate suitable warehouses for a secure site to construct
truck bombs."</TE>
<TE>   Four tons apparently were obtained in Malaysia, but cell members
seeking to buy 17 more tons from a local company were arrested before
they could complete the transaction. Neither Sammy nor Mike has been
identified or captured.</TE>
<TE>   A third operations cell was formed after Sept. 11. "They conducted
some preliminary surveillance and observation of a few targets, including
U.S. companies, but stopped" when the first arrests were made Dec. 9, the
ministry statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Singaporean police arrested six people in that first wave and searched
their homes and offices. Nine other men were picked up by Dec. 24,
although two subsequently were released. The 13 being held have been
ordered detained for at least two years under Singapore's internal
security laws.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the cell members fit seamlessly into Singaporean
society. All had attended national schools, six were military reservists,
and all but one lived in the state-supported high-rise public housing
units that cover the tropical island nation.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian officials first uncovered evidence of their Al Qaeda cell
May 18 when two alleged terrorists were killed and a third was wounded
during a bungled bank robbery.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation led to the arrest in Malaysia a month later of
Mohamad Iqbal B.A. Rahman, an Indonesian cleric who is now alleged to be
a leader of the Al Qaeda network. He has been ordered detained for at
least two years.</TE>
<TE>Botched Bombing Gave Police a Break</TE>
<TE>   Authorities got another break Aug. 1, when Taufik Abdul Halim, a
26-year-old Malaysian, botched the bombing of a shopping mall in Jakarta,
the Indonesian capital, blew off his leg and was arrested. Investigators
traced him back to Malaysia, and a second round of arrests of KMM members
followed.</TE>
<TE>   "After the Jakarta bombing, a lot of information came out," Malaysian
Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said in an interview in Kuala Lumpur.</TE>
<TE>   Hamid said that the organization was planning to attack a U.S. naval
vessel during a rest stop in Malaysia but that the plot was broken up
before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "With our exchange of information with Indonesia and looking at the
groups operating in the Philippines, we see that there is a networking,"
Hamid said. "Some of the people we have arrested have been in Pakistan
and Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   A third wave of 15 arrests of alleged KMM members in Malaysia took
place in December and early January in the wake of the Singaporean
roundup. The Malaysian government says it has arrested a total of 47
people linked to the KMM and believes that more remain at large.</TE>
<TE>   A tip from Singaporean authorities also led to the seizure of a ton of
explosives and the arrests of four men allegedly linked to Jemaah
Islamiah in the Philippines last week. One of those arrested, a
30-year-old Indonesian, reportedly told police that he was collecting the
explosives for use in other Southeast Asian nations.</TE>
<TE>   Though Indonesians appear to be at the center of the regional terror
network, the government in Jakarta has been slow to act.</TE>
<TE>   Other than the mall bomber and his accomplice, Indonesia has made no
known arrests of suspected Al Qaeda members. Abu Bakar Bashir, who has
been identified by Singapore as the top leader of Jemaah Islamiah, openly
lives and teaches at a Muslim school in Solo on the Indonesian island of
Java.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had virtually no success in convincing the Megawati government
in cooperating with the war on terrorism," a U.S. official in Washington
said, referring to Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri.</TE>
<TE>   Top Indonesian officials have given contradictory public statements
about whether Al Qaeda is operating there.</TE>
<TE>   "The Al Qaeda network [in Indonesia] is more talk than reality,"
Foreign Minister Hasan Wirayudha told reporters Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda operatives allegedly ran a training camp for hundreds of
foreigners on the island of Sulawesi. Indonesian officials have located
the site where such a camp could have been, but they say there is no
evidence that it was used for this purpose. Wirayudha also noted that
Indonesia repealed its anti-subversion law after the fall of its longtime
strongman and president, Suharto, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Because Malaysia and Singapore have internal security acts, people
who just yawn about terrorism can be investigated," he said. "Here, with
the revocation of the anti-subversion laws, it's not easy to call and
question people who dream about terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats say they believe that Al Qaeda members have visited
Indonesia at least half a dozen times in the last two years. They fear
that the vast archipelago, which has porous borders and millions of
disaffected youths, may be a prime breeding ground for potential
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that people linked to Al Qaeda have been here, have scoped
things out and made contacts," said a Western diplomat in Jakarta. "Our
intellect tells us this would be an ideal place. God knows, if they are
active in a place like Singapore, what on Earth must be happening here?"</TE>

<HD>Germans Mark Horrors of Nazi Genocide Plot</HD>

<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>In an elegant lakeside villa framed by frosted shrubbery and
falling snow, 15 high-ranking Nazis sorted out the bureaucratic details
for exterminating Europe's 11 million Jews. As the conference invitations
had promised, luncheon followed.</LD>
<LD>   It took only 90 minutes for Adolf Hitler's henchmen to transform the
scattered arrangements for his "final solution" into a state-run program
for mass deportations and indiscriminate slaughter--the Wannsee
Protocol--on that snowy Tuesday 60 years ago today.</LD>
<LD>   The Wannsee Conference, named after the lake on which the villa is
situated, was a watershed event in Third Reich history because it
elevated the unspoken plot to annihilate European Jewry into the
machinery of the state.</LD>
<TE>   The 15 participants, all later killed or imprisoned except for the
fugitive Heinrich Mueller, of whom no trace was found, were chosen by
host Reinhard Heydrich for the broad swath of expertise and resources
they commanded. They were deputy ministers for police, security, justice
and planning. They were the ones who could put ideas into action. Three
years and one bloody springtime later, 6 million Jews had been
slaughtered.</TE>
<TE>   With the passage of 60 years and extensive academic research and
remorseful reflection, Germans have come to see Wannsee as a tragic
milestone because of the passive acceptance of mass murder apparent among
the protocol's authors.</TE>
<TE>   "There has never been a bleaker rendition of the orderly governance of
murder," British historian Mark Roseman writes in a newly released
account of the conference, "The Villa, the Lake, the Meeting: Wannsee and
the Final Solution." "To this day the Wannsee Protocol remains the most
emblematic and programmatic statement of the Nazi way of doing genocide."</TE>
<TE>   Today's anniversary is being observed here with memorial events
throughout the city and the first extensive exhibition on the Holocaust
at the German Historical Museum. Like the Wannsee villa display, it
attempts to explain how Germans' World War II hardship helped fuel an
acceptance of state anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   The date is also rekindling Germany's recurring debate over the
culture of memory, a mostly one-sided discussion of how much guilt and
responsibility should still encumber a nation where many of the
perpetrators have long since died.</TE>
<TE>   Not a murmur of dissent was mentioned in the 15 pages of minutes from
the meeting taken down by Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi security chief and
expert on the "Jewish question." There were conflicting views about where
to start and how much to invest in keeping alive some of the doomed long
enough to build their own prisons, but on the big picture the architects
of genocide were all on the same page.</TE>
<TE>   "The meeting was conducted quietly and with much courtesy, with much
friendliness. There was not much speaking, and it did not last a long
time. The waiters served cognac, and in this way it ended," Eichmann
recalled during his 1961 trial in Israel, where he was executed a year
later.</TE>
<TE>   The smudged, faded pages of the protocol include guidance to
government offices for the "evacuation" of Jews and instructions for
determining the fate of those of mixed background. One neatly aligned
table totes up the number of Jews in each of the 31 countries and
occupied regions and concludes that more than 11 million Europeans were
in need of extermination.</TE>
<TE>   More a secret code of policies than actual marching orders, the
protocol left itself open to amendment, allowing the Nazis to later add
homosexuals, Communists, the mentally and physically disabled and Gypsies
such as the Sinti and the Roma to the list of authorized victims.</TE>
<TE>   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, an unwavering voice for the majority
opinion here that those who fail to dwell on the crimes of the past are
destined to repeat them, again spoke for his fellow Germans in a formal
statement issued to coincide with the anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   "It clarified the whole perversion of the Nazi system and served as
unique documentation of the breakdown of civilization that even today
leaves us speechless," Schroeder said of Wannsee. "The more time
distances us from these events, the more urgent is our task to ensure
that the remembrances of these crimes against humanity are preserved and
unfalsified so they can be passed from generation to generation."</TE>
<TE>   Wannsee's significance to a historical perspective on the Holocaust
was a long time coming to the consciousness of Germans. In the mid-1960s,
a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp, Joseph Wulf, tried with
the help of the World Jewish Congress to acquire the villa and turn it
into a memorial and education center. But Klaus Schuetz, then mayor of
West Berlin and empowered to veto such projects, did so on the grounds
that Wulf's proposal was "macabre."</TE>
<TE>   The villa, which was acquired by the Nazi Party in 1940 for use as a
retreat by senior officers, was used by Soviet troops after the Third
Reich's defeat in 1945, then by U.S. officers and later as a vocational
school in what was, until reunification in 1990, the southwestern extreme
of divided Berlin. Not until the 50th anniversary of the conference, Jan.
20, 1992, was the villa opened as a memorial and documentation center.
More than 500,000 people have since visited the site.</TE>
<TE>   "German historians were extremely slow in turning their attention to
the National Socialist era because many of them were compromised by their
own past deeds," the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung commented Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Writing in Saturday's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Holocaust
historian Goetz Aly suggested that the significance of the Wannsee
gathering was the cool precision with which genocide was broken down into
civil servants' assignments. Germans' methodology discloses a lot, he
implied with the observation that tiny, Nazi-occupied Denmark was able to
thwart Berlin's orders for deportation of its Jews while citizens in the
homeland of the Holocaust's inventors put up no resistance.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest open questions remaining about the Wannsee Conference are
clear: What did the Germans know? What did they want to know?" Aly asked.
"To what extent were they hardened by war, the bombings and their daily
concerns? What did they feel, and how natural did it seem for them to
profit from deportation?"</TE>
<TE>   The Wannsee meeting's minutes show that the participants saw ways of
easing the housing shortages in bombed northern cities by dispossessing
Jews and of rewarding self-sacrificing Germans with the food and fuel
still being, in the conferees' view, wasted on the doomed Jews already in
camps and prisons.</TE>
<TE>   Host Heydrich even had a strategy for guarding against public
sympathies being stirred up over the campaign of extermination: Old Jews
with the venerable status of having fought for Germany during World War I
were spared the gas chambers and sent off instead to the Theresienstadt
ghetto for artists, veterans and other elites.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, Heydrich noted, would those making a reality of Hitler's plot to
annihilate the Jews remove the need for humanitarian "interventions."</TE>

<HD>Spy Issue Seems to Not Bug Beijing</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: China's lack of formal protest against reported U.S.
espionage bid on plane points to a desire to maintain stable ties,
analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As government officials declined to comment Saturday on reports
that U.S. intelligence had bugged a new Chinese presidential aircraft,
some American experts predicted that the alleged incident will have no
lasting impact on Sino-American relations.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the CIA, White House and State Department all cited a
policy against responding to reports of espionage activities. "On these
types of allegations, our policy is just not to comment," said Mike
Tadie, a CIA spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   In Japan, Richard Boucher, the senior State Department spokesman, said
he was aware of the allegations but declined to comment on them.</LD>
<TE>   The alleged bugging, first reported Saturday by the Washington Post
and the Financial Times of London, involved a Boeing 767 jetliner that
was bought by Beijing in June 2000 and refitted in San Antonio with
special amenities for Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese intelligence and aviation officials reportedly found numerous
listening devices on the plane last fall, when the aircraft was
undergoing test flights. The highly sophisticated devices were discovered
in such places as the president's bathroom and the headboard of his bed,
according to the newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Chinese would have known of the bugs for several months,
they have so far made no formal protest to the United States. That fact
suggests that though the alleged incident might be an irritant, it might
not be a major setback to Sino-U.S. relations, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   One Defense Department official, who declined to be identified, said
that spy activities are assumed to be directed against one another by any
number of countries. He noted that Israel, one of the closest U.S.
allies, has spied on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Bates Gill, a China expert at the Brookings Institution think tank in
Washington, predicted that the surveillance effort, if true, "would not
have any lasting effect," especially because the bugs seem to have been
discovered before Jiang used the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Gill said China's apparent decision not to protest underscores the
leadership's deep desire to maintain the steadiness of its ties to the
United States. Jiang and other leaders believe that will enable them to
focus on their most important tasks, including the socioeconomic
transformation of their country and a reshuffling of the leadership that
is coming up this year, Gill said.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine what the reaction would have been like in our country if we
had discovered that the Chinese had bugged Air Force One," Gill said.
Yet, "we're the most important single relationship China has, and they're
going to go a long way to make sure the relationship remains stable."</TE>
<TE>   The reports of espionage came about a month before a scheduled summit
between President Bush and Jiang in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   China has an increasingly close economic relationship with the United
States, which buys about 40% of its exports. Yet Sino-U.S. relations have
been strained by a number of developments in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the Bush administration upset Chinese officials by
deciding to cast aside the 1972 treaty with Russia that restricted the
countries' antimissile defenses. The Chinese fear that the United States
will build a missile defense system that could neutralize the Communist
nation's relatively small nuclear arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   Last April, after one of its fighter jets collided with a U.S. EP-3
spy plane gathering intelligence off the Chinese coast, China held the
U.S. crew for 11 days. And in May 1999, a U.S. warplane participating in
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's air war against Yugoslavia
accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in the Yugoslav capital,
Belgrade.</TE>
<TE>   Those incidents unleashed an outpouring of anger from ordinary Chinese
against the United States.</TE>
<TE>   As to the alleged U.S. bugging of the presidential plane, Gill said,
Chinese leaders may have wanted to avoid provoking another such powerful
reaction.</TE>

<HD>Congo Struggles in Aftermath of Volcanic Blast</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Many of the 500,000 refugees search for missing
relatives. At least 16 deaths are reported, but an accurate count could
take weeks.</DH>

<DL>GOMA, Congo
</DL>
<LD>With a mattress on her head and three young children at her side,
Anifa Asani was on a mission Saturday to find lost loved ones. She had
not seen her two older daughters and two other sons since Thursday, when
the 11,380-foot Mt. Nyiragongo volcano erupted, devastating this city on
the shores of Lake Kivu.</LD>
<LD>   The volcano, which still emitted an ominous orange glow, gave Gomans a
brief respite Saturday. Many of the 500,000 people displaced by the
eruption took the opportunity to count their dead and injured, find
missing friends and relatives, and ponder what was next for them. But by
late in the day, Asani's search had come up empty.</LD>
<LD>   "I've looked everywhere but inside that volcano," she said as she
rested with her brood under a bushy cypress. "But I can't give up now."</LD>
<TE>   Hospital officials in the neighboring hamlet of Gisenyi, Rwanda--where
about 350,000 refugees had gathered--confirmed that at least 16 people
had died from severe burns caused by the eruption. But U.N. officials
said it could take weeks before they know exactly how many people have
perished.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of people were killed by fast-flowing lava in 1977, the last
time Nyiragongo poured its wrath on Goma. Some local residents believe
that evil spirits inhabit the volcano.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, workers from the U.N. World Food Program began
distributing high-energy biscuits and water to thousands of refugees in
Ruhengeri, a Rwandan town an hour's drive from the Congolese border.</TE>
<TE>   The area has views of stunning green mountains cascading to the aqua
waters of Lake Kivu. Saturday, a number of homeless Gomans were gathered
around the lake for a meager, unwanted picnic.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, many people who had fled the volcano complained openly that
they had not received any food, water or clothing. Some said they felt
abandoned by the international community. Even as thousands of Gomans
crossed into Rwanda to escape Nyiragongo, many others made the opposite
journey, saying they felt safer and more comfortable in their Congolese
villages.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent the last two days in Rwanda, and no one offered me a drop of
water, food--nothing," said 27-year-old Furaha Mwulengezi, who crossed
back into Goma with her 1-month-old daughter, Sarah, strapped to her
back.</TE>
<TE>   "Rwanda is a poor country with too many people," said another refugee
who was waiting in Gisenyi for a wooden vessel to take him to a Congolese
town a three-hour boat ride across Lake Kivu. "Congo is almost as big as
a continent. Why would I want to suffer in a small country?"</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials acknowledge that they face a difficult task in
addressing the latest humanitarian crisis in Congo.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you're looking at vulnerable people in the short term, but
even for the long term, Goma is destroyed," said Judith Lewis, regional
director for the World Food Program. "It's going to take time to relocate
these people to help them get started again."</TE>
<TE>   Many Gomans returned home Saturday only to get a firsthand look at the
devastation. Homes and buildings near the city center were still
smoldering. Hot lava flowed slowly into Lake Kivu, creating instant
geysers and clouds of steam that made the lake look on fire.</TE>
<TE>   At the Goma airport, some jets were marooned amid 6-foot-high piles of
crusted lava. Across the street from the airport, U.N. officials reported
that their warehouse had been looted by Rwandan-backed rebel soldiers who
a few years ago seized control of this eastern Congolese community from
government forces.</TE>
<TE>   "Just take a look at this," said a Senegalese soldier, pointing to a
bank of vandalized computers and office furniture. "This was not done by
the volcano."</TE>
<TE>   According to witnesses, the rebel soldiers shot and killed at least
one looter and fired live ammunition at people who broke into homes and
stores in daylight. Some looters walked on still-smoldering lava to get
to their targets, the witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   It took a small battalion of rebel soldiers to keep looters away from
a dry goods store run by Indian businessman Nilech Thakkar.</TE>
<TE>   "This town is finished," Thakkar said as his workmen loaded bags of
sugar, flour and salt to take to Gisenyi for safekeeping.</TE>
<TE>   But for many Gomans, no place seemed safe. As they prepared to spend a
third night sleeping along the sides of the road, the earth trembled
violently at frequent intervals--signs that lava was moving up the crater
and that Nyiragongo was still alive.</TE>

<HD>Lifetime of Pain Is Legacy to Children of the Holocaust</HD>
<DH>Mental health: 'Second-generation' victims live without
understanding psychological scars. But more are seeking help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE JAHN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>VIENNA
</DL>
<LD>Robert Fleischner blocks out memories of his childhood. Stefan
Strosievici recoils at the sight of fuzzy-headed chemotherapy patients
and the tattooed arms of straphangers on the streetcar.</LD>
<LD>   They and tens of thousands of other Jews born after the Holocaust
escaped the wartime suffering of their fathers, mothers and other
relatives--yet inherited a lifetime of their pain.</LD>
<LD>   With the Holocaust generation now in their 70s and 80s, each year sees
fewer firsthand victims alive. But the legacy of their horrors has left
many of their sons and daughters emotionally disfigured.</LD>
<TE>   Most of these "second-generation" victims have gone through life
without understanding their psychological scars, experts say. But more
are beginning to recognize they need help--and are seeking it.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of having less work treating Holocaust-related problems over
the past few years, we're actually seeing our workload rise," said Dr.
David Vyssoki of ESRA, a Vienna outpatient clinic that treats victims of
the Nazi era.</TE>
<TE>   ESRA had a dozen second-generation cases in 1996, the first year such
records were kept. It treated 51 in the first nine months of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Vyssoki attributes the increase to the "time of latency"--as the years
add up, untreated emotional traumas become more intense.</TE>
<TE>   The typical patient knows little of his parents' ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   The sufferings of the Nazis' extermination camps, the deaths of close
relatives, were too horrific to discuss, creating "an oppressive climate
of silence, where the children grow up carrying an unspoken burden,"
Vyssoki said.</TE>
<TE>   Talking it out would have offered catharsis. Instead, guilt has built
in the minds of children knowing they escaped the hell their parents
endured.</TE>
<TE>   Vyssoki cites an Israeli study documenting how women with breast
cancer who were daughters of Nazi victims differed from other cancer
sufferers.</TE>
<TE>   "They were paralyzed; their coping mechanism self-destructed much more
frequently than cancer patients who did not grow up with the unspoken
terror of death," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even children of Jews who escaped the Nazi camps carry some of the
Holocaust burden.</TE>
<TE>   Strosievici's parents fled Vienna and the Nazis for the Soviet Union.
But when pressed, he acknowledges feeling queasy when he sees
chemotherapy patients who have lost their hair because of treatment. "It
reminds me of concentration camp inmates."</TE>
<TE>   Tattoos, says Strosievici, 44, bring back memories of relatives who
survived the camps but bore identification numbers on their forearms.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischner exhibits deeper hurts. His father and mother together lost
more than a dozen close relatives--fathers, mothers, uncles and cousins,
either sent to the gas chambers or worked to death in Nazi camps.</TE>
<TE>   His mother "repressed the Holocaust completely," Fleischner said. His
father blocked out his time in the camps by speaking only of episodes
"where he came out looking good"--outsmarting guards in the daily
survival struggle for that extra bit of food or the easier work detail.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no memories of my youth," Fleischner, 55, said of growing up
in Vienna, where adoring millions cheered Adolf Hitler when he visited to
mark the absorption of Austria into Nazi Germany on March 15, 1938. "The
only thing I remember was the fear of my mother because our district was
very anti-Semitic, so she always took care to make sure that I never
played with the other children.</TE>
<TE>   "I built up a wall around myself, without knowing why," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Painfully shy, "an observer, never a participant," Fleischner turned
to ESRA--"help" in Hebrew--in the mid-1990s on advice from his younger
brother, who worked there as a psychiatric nurse.</TE>
<TE>   The institute, financed by the Vienna city government and the Jewish
community, is one of only two of its kind in Europe, along with a similar
institute in the Netherlands. It set up 3 1/2 years of individual and
group therapy for Fleischner.</TE>
<TE>   "People often collapsed crying," he said of some of those sessions.
"Some things I just wouldn't do, like shaking hands with a psychologist
pretending to be a Nazi guard."</TE>
<TE>   He came away not healed but healing--still unable to remember his
first 12 years but ready to embrace Judaism after rejecting God for
allowing the Holocaust, and willing to reach out rather than waiting for
others to make the first move.</TE>
<TE>   He now can watch televised violence or Holocaust documentaries.
Divorced after a "marriage of silence," he has remarried. And for the
first time, he has friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized that all this time, I felt guilty for something I had
nothing to do with," he said softly. "I have been freed of a burden that
I carried for as long as I can remember, without it belonging to me."</TE>

<HD>Carnage Chronicle Shows Bosnia Pain</HD>
<DH>History: Red Cross book contains an accounting of unidentified
victims' belongings. But few want to see it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE STANGE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS
</DL>
<LD>At the local Red Cross office, there's a history book sent from the
other side of the world. Few want to open it because the pages document a
bloody chapter of history few want to revisit.</LD>
<LD>   The "Book of Personal Belongings," two volumes thick, is filled with
thousands of photographs of lost possessions. Everything is soiled with
dirt: clothing, jewelry, combs, Polaroids. The possessions belonged to
the dead, and the dirt came from mass graves.</LD>
<LD>   The book was sent to the United States in a Red Cross experiment to
aid in the accounting of the 18,000 people missing from the war in
Bosnia-Herzegovina during the 1990s. The Red Cross wants to see if the
refugee community in St. Louis, among the largest in the United States,
can help shorten the list of the missing by recognizing items in the
book.</LD>
<TE>   The volumes are also a test of sorts to see how willing these new
Americans are to face a haunting past.</TE>
<TE>   Family members look for familiar objects, personal items belonging to
loved ones who have not been seen for years. On each page of the book
there are four photographs showing one, two or a few objects found on a
recovered body. Sometimes it's a distinctive item of clothing. Or maybe
it's a dog-eared family snapshot, with smiling faces.</TE>
<TE>   Many Bosnians have presumed their relatives are dead and have tried to
move on.</TE>
<TE>   "We had one man who sobbed for three hours," said Lejla Susic, a
native of Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, who is now the international
specialist at the St. Louis Red Cross. "Sometimes people are stoic, and
other times they're not."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis was chosen because of the size of the Bosnian community
here--an estimated 35,000 people. Hundreds of those families came from
the area near Srebrenica, site of what has been called the worst massacre
in Europe since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Between 7,000 and 10,000 Bosnian Muslim men were systematically killed
when Serb forces overran Srebrenica in 1995. Thousands were buried in
mass graves; others were left unburied. So far, the Book of Personal
Belongings only includes those recovered from bodies found near
Srebrenica.</TE>
<TE>   To notify people about the book, the Red Cross mailed letters to
Bosnians throughout St. Louis. Word of mouth has helped inform
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   But few have stepped forward to look through it. Ron Klutho, a
resettlement case worker who assists Bosnians in St. Louis, said many
refugees have made forgetting the past a part of their adjustment to the
United States. Others doubt they can truly find answers about lost
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them are just not psychologically ready," Klutho said.
"There's a strain of suspicion in them that, because of what happened,
that they don't want to trust anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Susic suspects it has more to do with her fellow Bosnians being busy
in their new lives--or sometimes using their hectic schedule as an excuse
to delay the discomfort.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are kind of swamped by the American lifestyle and
they have no time," Susic said. "Of course, they would rather work
overtime and work weekends rather than come here and face the book."</TE>

<HD>Rome March Supports Immigration</HD>
<DH>Italy: Thousands decry government's plan to tighten borders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of people, including thousands of immigrants
calling for a "world without borders," protested in Rome on Saturday
against Italy's plans to crack down on immigration.</LD>
<LD>   There were no immediate reports of violence as the march moved through
the streets accompanied by drums, music, chants, dances and flags.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers said there were more than 100,000 protesters. Police did
not provide an estimate.</LD>
<TE>   At the head of the march, activists held a banner reading: "Against
the racist law of the government." Others read: "No law can stop
humanity" and "A world without borders."</TE>
<TE>   "With this law, the government is creating more illegal immigrants and
reduces their rights," said Livia Turco, a minister in the previous
center-left administration who drafted the immigration law that the
government is now trying to change.</TE>
<TE>   The center-right government led by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi,
which had made tougher immigration laws a key part of its manifesto ahead
of a general election that it won last May, said Italians back the
government's plans.</TE>
<TE>   "The law is aimed at making sure that workers staying in Italy for a
limited period do not end up working in the black [market] economy,"
Deputy Interior Minister Alfredo Mantovano said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Parliament is discussing the new law, which would allow non-European
Union migrants to stay in Italy only with an employment contract and only
as long as the contract lasts.</TE>
<TE>   It would also make it easier to expel illegal immigrants, thousands of
whom land on Italy's long coastline every year.</TE>
<TE>   It provides no amnesty for illegal immigrants who already have jobs in
Italy, except perhaps for domestic workers.</TE>
<TE>   "The law poses too many obstacles to entry in Italy, risks producing
more illegal immigrants . . . and makes them easier to exploit," said
Miguel, a protester from Peru who has lived in Italy for nine years.</TE>
<TE>   Italy has one of Europe's lowest percentages of immigrant populations,
but anti-foreigner sentiment runs high.</TE>
<TE>   According to a poll published in December, a third of Italians believe
that immigration is the country's biggest problem.</TE>
<TE>   Caritas, a leading Roman Catholic charity, estimates that 300,000
illegal immigrants are working in the underground economy.</TE>

<HD>Besieged Arafat Meets With European Visitors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat called for
international intervention to ease tensions Saturday in the wake of
Israel's demolition of the Voice of Palestine broadcasting building.</LD>
<LD>   "The current situation is very dangerous," Arafat told journalists at
his Ramallah compound, which has been surrounded by Israeli tanks since
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "I call on the international community to make an immediate move to
rescue the situation before it explodes," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Arafat met at his besieged compound with a number of foreign visitors,
including Italian lawmakers and the outgoing Anglican archbishop of
Canterbury, George Carey.</TE>
<TE>   Carey urged Israelis and Palestinians to return to negotiations.
"Religious leaders have a part to play in this," he told reporters.
"Religion is not only part of the answer but also part of the problem."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli moves are part of a tough response to a Thursday night
attack by a Palestinian gunman who killed six people at a bat mitzvah
before he was shot to death.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Broadcasting Corp. chief Radwan abu Ayash rejected an
Israeli charge that Voice of Palestine is "a center of incitement against
the state of Israel, its citizens and against the Jewish people."</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a [Osama] Bin Laden training center. . . . This is
something cultural, civilian and human," Abu Ayash said.</TE>
<TE>   The Paris-based media freedom advocacy group Reporters Without Borders
said Saturday that it had written to Israel's defense minister to protest
the destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "This action is totally unacceptable, no matter what one might think
of the content of the programs broadcast by the Voice of Palestine," the
group quoted its secretary-general, Robert Menard, as saying.</TE>

<LD>An illegal immigrant trying to sneak into Britain was electrocuted
Saturday while hiding atop a freight train headed toward the Channel
Tunnel, the French rail operator said.</LD>
<LD>   Several dozen refugees had tried to hide aboard the train but were
discovered, the French national railway company SNCF said. The victim, a
man about 20 years old, escaped the security check and remained on board.
He was electrocuted when the train passed under power lines near Frethun,
in northern France.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the victim's identity nor his nationality was known, but he
had been staying at a Red Cross center in northern France that has become
a magnet for Afghans, Kurds and others hoping to slip into Britain.</LD>

<HD>A Third-World Threat to Ozone Layer</HD>
<DH>Health: Illegal CFCs are smuggled in for use in refrigeration
systems because they are cheaper than safer substances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY SMITH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>Tons of gases that eat away at the Earth's ozone layer are smuggled
into India and other developing nations each year in an illegal trade
that threatens a landmark treaty to phase out the harmful chemicals by
the end of the decade, environmentalists say.</LD>
<LD>   The gases, mainly chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, are used in air
conditioning and refrigerators. Environmentalists say their continued
use--particularly in populous developing countries--could undo efforts to
repair the ozone layer under the 1987 Montreal Protocol.</LD>
<LD>   The treaty, ratified by more than 170 countries, requires that the
most harmful ozone-depleting gases, such as CFCs, be phased out in
developing countries by 2010.</LD>
<TE>   Industrialized nations already stopped using them in 1996, but
companies there are still allowed to produce a limited quantity for
medicinal use and for supplying the basic needs of developing nations.</TE>
<TE>   But the Environmental Investigation Agency, a nonprofit organization
based in London and Washington, says a multimillion-dollar parallel
market is growing fast in poorer, tropical countries where old equipment
has yet to be switched over to cleaner chemicals. The illicit gases are
also attractive because they're cheaper than less destructive gases.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to clamp down on this illegal trade," said Ezra Clark, a
scientific expert for the group. "If not, ridding the world of these
harmful chemicals will remain unfinished business."</TE>
<TE>   Delegates from 108 countries, representing governments, United Nations
agencies and international organizations met in Sri Lanka last fall to
discuss ways to combat the problem. The meeting agreed to focus on
implementing existing commitments rather than negotiating new rules.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Montreal treaty, developing countries receive hundreds of
millions of dollars in World Bank funds to phase out CFCs.</TE>
<TE>   This would allow the hole in the ozone layer over the South
Pole--currently estimated at 9.6 million square miles--to gradually
repair itself, experts believe.</TE>
<TE>   The hole allows large amounts of harmful ultraviolet radiation to
reach the Earth's surface, increasing the incidence of skin cancer and
cataracts, reducing farm yields and harming fish stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Refrigerator manufacturers in developing nations from Brazil to Egypt
are replacing CFCs with less harmful chemicals. But illicit trafficking
in ozone-depleting substances is estimated to total 20,000 tons yearly,
the Environmental Investigation Agency says.</TE>
<TE>   The group expected about 1,000 tons of such substances, mainly CFC
gas, to be smuggled into India in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Brought in from neighboring Nepal and Bangladesh in canisters hidden
in food sacks or slung under rickshaws, the gas is sold mainly to
small-scale businesses at 200 rupees ($4) a canister, two-thirds the
price of safer gases, the group claims.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, if you're a small businessman in India and you can buy
CFCs cheaper, you will continue to do so rather than switch to cleaner
chemicals," said Julian Newman, a senior campaigner for the environmental
group.</TE>
<TE>   Usha Chandarskhar, head of the ozone division at India's Ministry of
Environment and Forests, said that the ministry is aware of the smuggling
but that the customs service is responsible for controlling illicit
trade. None of the several customs officials contacted by the Associated
Press were willing to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Newman said CFC smuggling in India is "just the tip of the iceberg."
He said it occurs throughout the Middle East and in Pakistan, Bangladesh,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and other Asian countries.</TE>
<TE>   Industrialized nations have updated their cooling equipment, leaving
poorer, developing nations as the main buyers in the parallel market.</TE>
<TE>   From producing 350,000 tons of ozone-depleting substances a year in
the late 1980s, European manufacturers produced just 35,000 tons last
year, according to industry estimates.</TE>
<TE>   "We are reducing production as demand for CFCs decreases," said Nick
Campbell, environment manager for fluorinated products at Atofina, a
major European chemicals maker.</TE>
<TE>   He said there are many places along distribution channels for legal
CFCs to be sidetracked into the illicit trade.</TE>
<TE>   Indian gas producers say the problem is worsened because they haven't
been able to acquire Western-developed technology for making cleaner
gases, which would lower the cost.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and European companies want to preserve their control over the
market, said S.C. Wadhwa, vice president of Gujarat Flurochemicals, one
of India's four main CFC manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian Institute for Chemical Technology in Hyderabad has been
trying to develop a process for making cleaner gas since the mid-1990s
but still isn't ready even for pilot tests, Wadhwa said.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell said Atofina was willing to talk about technology transfer.
"It's a question of making the judgment when a market is ready for
domestic production," he said.</TE>

<HD>Patients' Families Protest 'Wolves in White Coats'</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Malpractice complaints have soared in China along with
the cost of care. But the odds are against victims in the outdated legal
system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI
</DL>
<LD>Yu Jiyuan is the father of two dead sons--one a statistic in
China's appalling medical malpractice record, the other a casualty of a
legal system that protects doctors who do wrong.</LD>
<LD>   A single thought keeps Yu going: His 21-year-old son never should have
died from a routine asthma attack.</LD>
<LD>   Yu has gathered evidence that doctors in a Shanghai hospital denied
his son emergency medication, tied him up, forced oxygen on him and went
out to lunch as the young man lay dying.</LD>
<TE>   But 14 years and countless legal proceedings later, the courts still
back the hospital, which insists it did nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Yu's other son couldn't bear to watch his father smash his head
against China's great wall of bureaucracy. Two months before he was to be
married last year, the 31-year-old leaped off the balcony of his
fourth-floor apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "My son had told me, 'You can't get justice in this life,' " Yu
recalled recently. " 'I will avenge my brother's death in the
afterworld.' "</TE>
<TE>   Medical malpractice complaints have skyrocketed in China since market
reforms in recent years have turned health care for the majority of
Chinese from a government handout to an expensive privilege. Citizens of
the world's most populous country are shedding their old image as demure
comrades and standing up as defiant consumers.</TE>
<TE>   They are declaring hospitals with dismal safety records "execution
grounds." They are calling irresponsible doctors "wolves in white coats."
They are learning to hire lawyers and use the media, flexing muscles of
public opinion in an emerging civil society.</TE>
<TE>   But except in the most sensational cases, many victims' families, like
the Yus, find themselves abandoned by an inadequate judicial process,
waging an uphill battle on a trail of tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no hope," said Yu, sobbing in the sparse apartment the
58-year-old engineer shares with his wife. They have sold practically
everything of value to finance his crusade, including their wedding
bands. "Nothing will bring my sons back. But how can I let them die in
vain?"</TE>
<TE>   The Ministry of Health does not release official data on malpractice
cases. But last year, a national consumer hotline received more than
17,000 medical complaints. Horror stories become screaming headlines.
Live newborn twins are tossed into the garbage as dead fetuses. An
appendectomy leads to a missing ovary. A loose tooth turns into death
from an overdose of anesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   It goes on and on.</TE>
<TE>   "That's only the tip of the iceberg," said Yu Weihua (no relation to
Yu Jiyuan), a 31-year-old surgeon whose newborn daughter died in a
Guangdong delivery room because of what he calls hospital negligence.
"The actual numbers are much higher."</TE>
<TE>   Medical mistakes, of course, are not unique to China. In the U.S., a
special alert issued last month by a hospital regulatory agency said that
more and more surgeons are performing operations on the wrong patient or
the wrong part of the body. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations said 58 such errors had been reported last year,
up from 16 in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. physicians and hospitals, however, pay hefty premiums to insure
themselves against liability for any mistakes they make--a concept all
but unheard of in China.</TE>
<TE>   In this country, by contrast, many cases go unreported because
potential plaintiffs give up. At the heart of the matter is an outdated
redress system that almost guarantees failure for the victims.</TE>
<TE>   The single most important piece of evidence required to prove medical
malpractice in court is a medical appraisal by the local branch of the
national health bureau, the parent organization for all public hospitals.
Without that, there is no case. But such reports almost invariably
exonerate hospitals because most of the arbiters are local doctors with a
vested interest in the outcome of the rulings. Many hospitals' rankings
and revenues depend on avoiding malpractice blemishes.</TE>
<TE>Some Doctors Driven to Take Victims' Side</TE>
<TE>   The system is so rigged against patients, according to Chen Zhihua, a
Beijing lawyer who specializes in malpractice complaints, that they do
not even have access to their own records. Hospitals can easily falsify
or erase incriminating information to deny responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   The senselessness of it all has pushed even some doctors, like Yu
Weihua, to pick up the torch for disenfranchised patients by organizing
and speaking up for victims' families from around the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Open up the lawmaking process. Let us speak!" read an open letter Yu
posted on the Internet on behalf of fellow victims seeking to scrap one
old law that tips the scale in favor of doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital supporters, however, argue that no legislation will be good
enough if victims don't temper the unrealistic expectation that doctors
never make mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying there are no bad doctors who are irresponsible," said
Tong Jianyun, an internist turned attorney who primarily represents large
state hospitals in malpractice suits. "Hospitals are not five-star
hotels. You take a chance any time you receive medical treatment. It's
unrealistic to expect a hospital visit to be a complete risk-free
experience."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike doctors in the West, Chinese physicians are notoriously
low-paid. At a few hundred dollars a month, salaries are not much better
than what workers at state-owned factories earn. The only way to motivate
physicians to take extra care, it often seems, is to bribe them with "red
envelope" money, an illegal but widely used option of last resort.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese doctors' workload, moreover, is surely among the highest in
the world. Some physicians treat 40 to 50 patients a day. "That's an
average of about six minutes per patient each morning," Tong said.
"Objectively, how can they give quality service?"</TE>
<TE>   What's happened at some hospitals, victims argue, seems to defy common
sense.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Zhuang said she lost her mother not to cancer but to its
treatment. She watched doctors at a Shanghai hospital repeatedly drain
high volumes of fluid from her mother's stomach. But they failed to
replenish the patient's weakening body with the adequate amount of blood
serum as clearly instructed by their own medical manual, Zhuang said,
pointing to the text.</TE>
<TE>   "I begged them to give her more blood," said Zhuang, who herself
trained as a nurse. "Her pulse was fading. I almost got on my knees. The
doctor told me what they gave her was enough."</TE>
<TE>   That evening, Zhuang's mother died.</TE>
<TE>   The incident confirmed another unwritten rule, Zhuang said. Unless the
patients have special connections, hospitals tend to ignore cancer
sufferers, because "they are just someone waiting to die." The hospital
denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Yu Jiyuan's son wasn't suffering from a terminal illness. The
circumstance of his death were equally avoidable.</TE>
<TE>   As a computer whiz, Yu Haiwen had impressed his teachers at a young
age. In college, he was an ace student working on a transfer to Yale
University.</TE>
<TE>   But because of his background as a student activist, school officials
refused to release his transcripts, which made it impossible for him to
leave the country. In protest, he went on a hunger strike. Officials
ignored him. He fell into a depression. They sent him to a mental
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve days later, he was dead.</TE>
<TE>Asthma Attack Proved Fatal for Youth</TE>
<TE>   "My son had asthma all his life, so he knew what medication he
needed," his father recalled of the day his son suffered what appeared to
be a routine asthma attack. "He was on the floor begging for his
respirator."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital said it didn't have one. Apparently, the doctors
initially thought the patient was faking, his father said.</TE>
<TE>   When the young man continued to beg for help, the doctors forced
oxygen on him--also dangerous because he could not breathe. When he
refused the oxygen, according to witness accounts, he was tied up with a
tube taped to his nose.</TE>
<TE>   "They tied him up because it was lunchtime and they needed to go eat,"
his father said.</TE>
<TE>   By the time they came back, Yu Haiwen had stopped breathing.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital claimed it had done everything for him that it could.</TE>
<TE>   The father demanded an autopsy. The hospital insisted that the body
had to be cremated immediately because its freezer was broken. The father
refused and called the police. A medical examiner looked at the body and
found no evidence of any emergency rescue.</TE>
<TE>   "That means the hospital fabricated the medical record," Yu said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this critical finding, a court ultimately could not rule
against the hospital because of the all-powerful appraisal committee's
verdict: not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The best the judge could do was order the hospital to pay the
patient's family the equivalent of $85, minus $73 in legal fees.
"Probably because the judge realized they shouldn't have tied him up,"
Jiang Weizhong, Yu's lawyer, said. "But that's not an admission of
negligence."</TE>
<TE>   The outraged father has been appealing ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "His case seemed pretty clear-cut to me," Jiang said. "But under the
current law, there's no way he could win because the courts could not
overturn the decision of the appraisal committee."</TE>
<TE>   China may have no choice eventually but to eliminate outdated laws
that don't meet international standards, especially as the country
adjusts to life after joining the World Trade Organization. Rising
competition among local medical centers and shrinking financial support
from the state are also forcing many Chinese hospitals to improve
standards and accountability.</TE>
<TE>   Until things change, however, health care in China remains shrouded in
a dark cloud of fear and distrust. And people like Yu will keep pursuing
their wrenching quests, reaching out to anyone willing to listen.</TE>
<TE>   "My younger son had told me to stop writing. We had already four boxes
full of material," Yu said. "He said words are useless, there is no
justice. But I won't give up until the day I die."</TE>

<HD>Russian Bells Are Ringing In New Era of Religious Freedom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEXEI VLADYKIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>KAMENSK-URALSKY, Russia
</DL>
<LD>On the November day when Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev was buried
back in 1982, priests say the Kremlin ordered every church bell in the
country to be rung in remembrance.</LD>
<LD>   It would have been an impressive sound, if not for one thing: Most of
the bells were gone--victims of the Communist Party's long campaign
against religion.</LD>
<LD>   With the religious revival since the Soviet Union broke apart a decade
ago, bells are again in demand in Russia. A few enterprising metal
workers have stepped in to fill the market niche and the empty bell
towers. As the bells ring out their melodious chimes, the bell-makers
ring up profits.</LD>
<TE>   Nikolai Pyatkov recalls being fascinated by an article he read about
the history of bell-casting in a magazine in 1984. At the time, he and
his younger brother, Viktor, worked as metal casters in a factory in the
town of Kamensk-Uralsky, about 900 miles east of Moscow in the Ural
Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "I started to gather literature on the subject, and my brother and I
tried to experiment with different molds in a shed, but we were afraid to
do it in the open," says Nikolai Pyatkov, 42.</TE>
<TE>   Though some churches functioned during the Soviet era, many were torn
down after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Others were destroyed during
World War II, never to be restored.</TE>
<TE>   Even where churches were left standing, the bells were often removed.
They were melted down to provide metal for power cables, tractor parts
and other industrial items. By some estimates, 99% of Russia's bells were
destroyed in the Soviet era.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, after restrictions on religion were relaxed, the Soviet
Cultural Foundation printed an ad in a newspaper asking for help casting
bells. The Pyatkovs offered their services.</TE>
<TE>   Today, their company employs eight people and produces bells for 50 to
60 churches around the country each year. Their rented premises have
become a bit tight, so they've taken a $67,000 loan and begun work on
their own factory.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how big the plant, church bells can't be produced on an
assembly line, since subtleties of size and shape determine a bell's
tone.</TE>
<TE>   "A good sound from a bell depends, first of all, on the quality of
bronze," Nikolai Pyatkov says. "A strike of the clapper should produce a
powerful sound followed by a long, velvety hum."</TE>
<TE>   In Russia, each parish has a unique, traditional melody, often
associated with the history of the church or the town where it is
located. When buying bells--which vary in size from about 110 pounds to
1.65 tons--churches order specific combinations to recreate those
melodies. On average, churches have 20 to 25 bells.</TE>
<TE>   The job of ringing the bells is often left to theological students or
other volunteers. At the Cathedral of the Transfiguration in the nearby
city of Yekaterinburg, the Russian Orthodox diocese is considering
establishing a bell-ringers' school to help preserve the proper
technique.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the often joyous and lighthearted sounds of bells, producing
them is not easy work.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Dneprov, director of a Yekaterinburg bell company that competes
with the Pyatkovs, recalls how one priest argued over the price.</TE>
<TE>   Dneprov, a historian who collects bell lore such as the Brezhnev
story, brought the priest to see the gas furnace in the casting shop.
When his beard began to crackle from the heat, the priest gave in.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see it's hell's work," Dneprov quotes him as saying. "Give me
the bill."</TE>

<HD>Bomb Threat Sends U.S.-Bound Jet to Iceland</HD>

<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>A passenger jet flying from Britain to Florida with 340 people on
board was diverted to Iceland on Saturday after the crew found a bomb
threat and anti-American messages scrawled with soap on a bathroom
mirror.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic Airways said the threat seemed to be
fake. "We believe this is the work of a hoaxer. It is a shame that people
are being disrupted," Ben Hall said.</LD>
<LD>   The Boeing 747 landed safely at Keflavik airport, 30 miles southwest
of the capital, Reykjavik, about six hours after it took off from
London's Gatwick airport for Orlando, officials said. It had 322
passengers and 18 crew members.</LD>
<TE>   Keflavik Police Commissioner Johann Benediktsson said the threat
"contained the phrase 'all Americans must die' and other anti-American
sentiment."</TE>
<TE>   The passengers were being kept overnight for questioning in an attempt
to find the author of the message.</TE>
<TE>   Fridthor Eydal, spokesman for a nearby U.S. naval base, said hand
luggage and passengers would be searched.</TE>
<TE>   Hall said the travelers would stay in a hotel and leave this morning.</TE>

<LD>Belgian police questioned a man after finding his five children
killed along with the lover of his estranged wife, a court official said.</LD>
<LD>   Police believe the man, Ozan Selamet, may have killed his sons, ages
18, 10 and 6, and a daughter, 4, when they were visiting him, and then
drove the bodies to the house where they lived with their mother.</LD>
<LD>   It appeared he then entered the house, in a Brussels suburb, and shot
dead his other daughter, 16, and a man in his 30s believed to be his
wife's lover, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Apart from the eldest son, who had gunshot wounds, the children found
in the car appeared to have been strangled, the official said.</TE>

<DL>BUERGENSTOCK, Switzerland
</DL>
<LD>Sudan's government and rebels agreed Saturday to a cease-fire in
the vast country's Nuba Mountains, opening the way for aid to reach the
troubled region and boosting hopes for wider peace in one of Africa's
longest civil wars.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiators from the government and the southern-based Sudanese
People's Liberation Army, or SPLA, signed the deal during talks mediated
by U.S. and Swiss diplomats. They agreed to stop fighting in the
mountains within three days.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides said more must be done to end 18 years of civil war in
Sudan, where more than 2 million people are believed to have died in
fighting and related famines.</LD>
<TE>   "This cease-fire agreement is our baby, and we shall nurse and nourish
it until it matures into a comprehensive and lasting peace," said Mutrif
Siddig, head of the Sudanese government delegation.</TE>
<TE>   Abdel Aziz Adam Hilu, head of the SPLA delegation, said, "This
agreement will make it possible for the Nuba people to receive
international assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "But until and unless a comprehensive political settlement of the
conflict in the Sudan is reached, the conflict in the Nuba Mountains is
far from resolved," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The deal foresees a monitoring commission of representatives of each
side and neutral parties, and an international monitoring team.</TE>

<HD>Thatcher Statue May Join Old London Bridge</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A giant statue of one of Britain's best known politicians could be
about to join the old London Bridge in Arizona, a newspaper said today.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-ton marble figure of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is
eventually destined for the Members' Lobby of the House of Commons, but
the rules dictate that it can't be erected until five years after her
death.</LD>
<LD>   In the meantime, no suitable resting place can be found in Britain,
but the Sunday Telegraph said the 8-foot statue had attracted the
attention of Lake Havasu City in Arizona, already famous as the home
since 1969 of the old London Bridge.</LD>

<HD>Sky's the Limit for Hot Asian Space Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TSUKUBA, Japan
</DL>
<LD>Caged by yellow catwalks in a hangar outside Tokyo, Japan's most
hyped and technically advanced space project looks more like a bus-sized
dog food can than a space station module.</LD>
<LD>   But when launched into orbit three years from now, the research
capsule will be the only part of the international space station
designed, built and run by an Asian country.</LD>
<LD>   Japan's high-tech wizardry boosted it into that elite club of space
travelers. Bristling with pride, Japan bills the vessel, called Kibo--or
Hope--as Asia's first manned spacecraft.</LD>
<TE>   Yet as the 16-year, $4-billion venture entered the final phase of
testing in November, Japan's space program was faltering. And as an
Asia-wide space race is just beginning to heat up, it's all Japan can do
to keep a tenuous lead.</TE>
<TE>   "This project is very important," says Hideo Nagasu, former director
of Japan's National Aerospace Laboratory. "We've spent so much time and
money on this, we have to be successful."</TE>
<TE>   The Asian space race may lack the high-profile propaganda of the Cold
War sprint for the moon. But it mirrors that showdown between the United
States and the Soviet Union in one important way: It is driven more by
strategic goals than scientific ones.</TE>
<TE>   The list of contenders is long.</TE>
<TE>   China wants to be the next country launching its own astronauts into
space; India is on the verge of mastering the cryogenic technology needed
to launch satellites or intercontinental ballistic missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Even impoverished North Korea claims to have an unmanned satellite
circling the globe in praise of its Great Leader.</TE>
<TE>   And nearby Australia is fueling regional rivalries by trying to break
into commercial launching with a new type of scram jet engine.</TE>
<TE>   "There are several space races going on," said space analyst Joan
Johnson-Freese, of the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies. "There's
the prestige race and the technological race. The official reason for
Japan's space station is microgravity research. The real reason is that
this is their foot in the door to a manned space program."</TE>
<TE>   Calling Kibo a manned spacecraft is a bit of a stretch.</TE>
<TE>   While the vessel has room for four astronauts to conduct experiments,
it will tentatively be launched by the U.S. space shuttle in three
separate shots beginning in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Japan doesn't have a rocket big enough to budge the 16-ton package and
the country isn't seriously entertaining plans to eventually launch its
own astronauts.</TE>
<TE>   China, on the other hand, has placed great prestige on and poured an
undisclosed amount of resources into its secretive 31-year-old space
program. Some estimates say China could be ready to put astronauts aloft
in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's $1.65 billion a year space program was shackled from its
inception, in part by the country's pacifist constitution. Human flights
were off limits because the reentry technology needed to bring astronauts
home safely was too closely linked with intercontinental ballistic
missiles, Nagasu said.</TE>
<TE>   But that thinking changed when North Korea lobbed a rocket over Japan
in 1998. Japan not only became more interested in human space flight, it
vowed to send up its first spy satellite by 2003.</TE>
<TE>   To put its own probes in space, Japan has even embarked on a new
rocket program, the H-2A, which could pit it against Europe and the
United States in the lucrative commercial launching market.</TE>
<TE>   If the Jan. 31 final test launch is a success, Japan will proceed with
11 scheduled operational launches through 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Kibo mission commander Kumiaki Shiraki denies his project plays into
Asia's space race--but it's clear what his expectations are.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to accumulate the technology for manned missions, which will
be essential to the further development of our program," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kibo gives Japan access to the state-of-the-art outer space air
conditioning, life-support and energy-supply systems used by NASA. And
for the first time, Japan will be training its own astronauts for the
space mission, instead of having NASA do the work.</TE>
<TE>   China, long isolated by both the United States and Russia, at first
had to develop portions of its space program from scratch and specializes
in basic, but reliable, spacecraft,</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Japan has focused on high-tech gadgetry, often with mixed
results.</TE>
<TE>   It has successfully put a satellite in orbit around the moon and
docked two satellites in space by remote control. But it also has a
history of mechanical breakdowns, budget overruns and two failed
launches, only recently reversed with the successful first liftoff of
Japan's next-generation H-2A rocket in August.</TE>
<TE>   Kibo is considered a bright spot.</TE>
<TE>   "Before this, Japan never had its own manned flight system," boasts
Shiraki, waving a hand at the hulk behind him in an assembly room the
size of a sports stadium. "I'm proud."</TE>
<TE>   Two round windows at the end of Kibo's 33-foot long pressured cabin
peer out like eyes over a platform--or "back porch," where a robot arm
can carry out experiments exposed to the vacuum of space.</TE>
<TE>   But even that feature, unique of all contributions to the
international space station, shows just how far Japan has to go in being
accepted as an equal, independent partner.</TE>
<TE>   NASA has the right to use half of Kibo's research facilities for its
own experiments.</TE>
<TE>   And perhaps more symbolic, Japan's spacesuits, while emblazoned with
rising sun flag on one shoulder, are also festooned with the U.S.
stars-and-stripes on the other--something unthinkable in China.</TE>

<HD>Saudi Ties to Taliban Draw Retrospective U.S. Criticism</HD>
<DH>Security: Despite calls to rethink its policy, the Bush
administration remains committed to the oil-rich kingdom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
</DL>
<LD>Even after Osama bin Laden was linked to a 1995 bomb blast that
killed five Americans in this capital, top Saudi officials said they
trusted the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan to watch over its guest and
stop his terrorist activities.</LD>
<LD>   And in 1998, when the Taliban regime rejected demands to turn over Bin
Laden to Saudi custody, the officials continued to believe that the
Afghans eventually would do the right thing.</LD>
<LD>   "We never underestimated Bin Laden's influence," insisted Prince Turki
al Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence. "The Taliban claimed
they had control over him. We kept telling the authorities there that he
was contradicting their assertions."</LD>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia's relations with the Taliban may seem like ancient
history now that the Islamic militants have been forced from power and
scattered, along with their allies in Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. But
the Saudis' actions--or at least perceptions of those actions--have
brought calls from some past and present American officials to rethink
U.S. ties to the strategic desert kingdom, though the Bush administration
remains committed to the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "The Saudis have exported an extreme form of Islamist philosophy,"
former CIA Director R. James Woolsey recently told Associated Press.
"Much of the money for Al Qaeda has come from Saudi Arabia."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said
last week that the U.S. should consider pulling its 5,000 soldiers out of
the country, where American forces have been stationed since Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a base in that region, but it seems to me we should find a
place that is more hospitable," Levin said. "I don't think they want us
to stay there."</TE>
<TE>   The Saudis bristle at such criticism because they don't feel that they
made mistakes in their long relationship with the Taliban--and, by
extension, Al Qaeda--and because such talk cuts to the core of their
nation's central role in the Muslim world. As the birthplace of Islam and
the site of the faith's two holiest places, Saudi Arabia believes that it
has a religious responsibility to support Muslim organizations and
regimes around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, there have been allegations that some religious groups
use Saudi money to finance militant activities and that the Saudis have
no system to monitor how such funds are used. But the Saudis say they
have no intention of changing their practices.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened with Afghanistan is not a normal state of affairs,"
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al Faisal said in an interview. "It was the
exception, not the rule, and as such it is not going to affect our
policies or international relations with other Islamic communities and
the Muslim nation just because Afghanistan turned sour."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the Saudi public posture has been aimed at defusing whatever
perceived responsibility the government might have had for fostering
terrorists or, even inadvertently, supporting Al Qaeda. If mistakes were
made, officials here said, they were made in Washington or Kabul, the
Afghan capital.</TE>
<TE>   One official, for example, said a videotape found in Afghanistan that
shows Bin Laden suggesting he had advance knowledge of the attacks
lessens Saudi culpability because it indicated that many of the men
believed responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks did not know "they were
going on a suicide mission."</TE>
<TE>   Yet by the Saudis' accounts, the kingdom either underestimated Bin
Laden's influence in Afghanistan, overestimated the Taliban's allegiance
to Saudi Arabia, or both.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say that from the moment Bin Laden arrived in
Afghanistan from Sudan in 1996, he had tremendous influence over the
Taliban, giving millions of dollars to the regime's depleted treasury.
However, Turki maintains that Bin Laden had little power and was taken in
by the Afghans only because the Al Qaeda leader had helped their nation
fight Soviet troops in the 1980s. Turki, who headed Saudi intelligence
for many years, left the post shortly before the Sept. 11 attacks. Some
observers believe that he was replaced because of his inability to rein
in Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   When the Taliban took over in 1996, Turki said, it inherited Bin Laden
"as a refugee. His importance developed the longer he stayed in
Afghanistan. In 1998 he got close with [Taliban leader] Mullah Mohammed
Omar. For us, it was a matter of maintaining a watch for him."</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi regime had already been watching, aware that Bin Laden was
linked to such terrorist acts as the 1995 bombing here. Nevertheless,
officials said they continued to trust that the Taliban would control the
terrorist leader, who had been stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994.
The kingdom remained one of only three countries--along with Pakistan and
the United Arab Emirates--that recognized the Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   By 1998, when it became clear that his hosts could not or would not
limit Bin Laden's activities, a delegation of Saudis went to Kabul to
bring him home. To the Saudis' shock, they were rebuffed by Omar. A few
months later, officials said that Turki visited Kabul to bring Bin Laden
back but eventually was turned down.</TE>
<TE>   The only official response from the kingdom was to downgrade its
diplomatic relations with Afghanistan. It kept its embassy open and
staffed--again, officials said, because of their responsibility to allow
in Muslim pilgrims who visit the Saudi holy city of Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the relations between Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, we assumed
that no responsible government in Afghanistan would react in a negative
way to such a situation in which somebody there is accused of a crime in
Saudi Arabia," said Saud, the foreign minister.</TE>
<TE>   Some Western officials do not believe that Saudi Arabia intentionally
fostered an atmosphere in Afghanistan that was ripe for Bin Laden and his
followers but that the kingdom erred in maintaining ties with the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Though a Saudi, Bin Laden has called for the downfall of his
homeland's leaders, maintaining that they are corrupt and no longer
faithful to Islamic principles.</TE>
<TE>   "Saudi Arabia has more to lose from support of Islamic extremism,"
said a diplomat here who requested anonymity. "The Sept. 11 attack was
really aimed at Saudi Arabia. . . . The target was the U.S., but the goal
was to bring down the Saudi regime."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Western diplomat said the kingdom has gotten the
short end of the stick when it comes to the U.S. troop presence. The
forces based here since the 1991 Persian Gulf War have failed to topple
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein but are creating political problems for
the Saudi regime. Many people are either angry about having "infidels" on
sacred ground or simply embarrassed that Saudi Arabia can't defend
itself.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Saudi government says it wants to maintain strong
ties to Washington. Saudis also say that American critics need to take a
closer look at their own country if the war on terrorism is going to
succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "There is more money reaching these terrorist organizations from
Western countries, including the U.S., than comes from sources in the
Middle East or Islamic countries," Saud said. "The infrastructure of
personnel who work for recruiting and propagating the ideas, for
promoting the interests, they exist more in the capitals of Europe than
they exist in the capitals of the Middle East."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Talib's Yemen Stint a Series of Errors</HD>
<DH>Religion: John Lindh reportedly insulted other Muslims and objected
to studying with women.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGIE MASON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>John Walker Lindh bumbled his way through his first trip to the
Middle East, unwittingly insulting other Muslims and repeatedly getting
into trouble with authorities, say those who encountered the California
teenager in Yemen.</LD>
<LD>   Ultimately, he came to feel that the brand of Islam he encountered in
Yemen's capital was not fervent enough--he even objected to having women
in his classes, according to students and administrators at the school
where he studied Arabic.</LD>
<LD>   Lindh, the 20-year-old American who was captured in November fighting
with the Taliban in Afghanistan, traveled alone to Yemen in the summer of
1998, when he was 17. A recent Muslim convert, he stepped off the plane
full of zeal.</LD>
<TE>   He donned white robes and sandals, wore a full beard, and even
pretended to speak broken English with an Arabic accent before abandoning
the school where his parents had paid thousands of dollars for a year's
stay.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh instead sought more fundamentalist teachings in the country's
dangerous northern mountains but was repeatedly turned back by Yemen's
military, said Steven Hyland, who taught English and studied Arabic at
the Yemen Language Center.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an individual whose idealism led to ideology, and he lost all
ability for pragmatic thought," Hyland said by telephone from Texas.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the first time he embarrassed the school, situated in the
capital of Sana.</TE>
<TE>   That came the morning after his arrival. He had exchanged several
hundred dollars--a substantial sum in a country where the average civil
servant earns about $75 a month. On his way back from the money market,
Lindh saw beggars and decided to pay alms to the poor, one of the five
pillars of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "When you give money to beggars in the street, you give them about 10
rials," Hyland said. "He starts passing out 200-rial notes, which is way,
way, way too much."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh was mobbed. A woman who worked at the school had to break up the
crowd to protect the young American.</TE>
<TE>   "John is in the middle of this whirlwind of people," Hyland recalled.
"He's much taller than the average Yemeni, with a fistful of cash just
raised in the air with his left hand and with his right hand just duking
the Yemenis away."</TE>
<TE>   After that incident, Lindh told other students he was disenchanted
with aspects of Yemeni culture and began skipping classes at the school,
where about 15 language teachers instruct four or five students each in
several elegant buildings near the city's center.</TE>
<TE>   "From that point on, Yemenis weren't Muslims, and that was the
argument that he tried to make," Hyland said.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Mortensen, another student, said from Cairo that Lindh asked
peers to call him Suleiman, affected a "bogus" Arabic accent and wore
traditional Muslim garb unlike that of most Yemenis. Other foreign
students at the school mockingly nicknamed him "Yusuf Islam," the name
pop singer Cat Stevens took when he became a Muslim and rejected his
music career.</TE>
<TE>   "That whole convert thing just doesn't compute for lifelong Muslims.
It's almost like they're being made fun of in a way," Mortensen said. "He
was so clueless and so rigid, and it was almost patronizing. He adopts
all these ridiculous stereotypes."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh slipped up again by approaching another student, Rizwan Mawani,
who happens to be a Shih Muslim, and asking for directions to a Sunni
mosque. Lindh was adamant about not wanting to pray with Shiites, who are
part of the other main branch of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't insulted. I found it quite humorous," Mawani recalled in a
telephone interview from London. In Yemen, Mawani said, Shih and Sunni
Muslims typically pray side by side.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh was frustrated when he saw some Yemeni Muslims ignoring the
calls to prayer, students said. He was particularly bothered when Mawani
told Lindh he was more interested in taking a nap, Mawani recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Mawani said Lindh considered himself a Salafi, part of a movement
whose members believe they are promulgating the true Islamic faith as
taught by the prophet Muhammad in seventh-century Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   "Yemenis speak one of the purist forms of Arabic, but it's not a
fanatical country," said Barbara Bodine, U.S. ambassador at the time.
"Somebody looking for that fire-and-brimstone approach would get to Yemen
and be very unhappy. It's simply not there."</TE>
<TE>   The language center's owner, Sabri Saleem, said Lindh disappeared
after complaining that his classes included women and that the secular
school did not offer the Islamic studies he craved.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's goal, other students said, was to reach the mountains of
northern Yemen, a risky venture for an American teenager. Militants there
have kidnapped or killed numerous Western tourists.</TE>
<TE>   "John was problematic for the center because he kept trying to steal
away to the northern part of the country because there was an Islamic
theologian there that he wanted to study under," Hyland said.</TE>
<TE>   Saleem, interviewed by telephone recently while visiting the United
States, said Lindh did not surface until police caught him at the airport
months later. He had overstayed his visa and failed to get an exit visa.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh came home to Marin County, north of San Francisco, in the spring
of 1999. Eight months later, he returned to Yemen, then went to Pakistan
and then Afghanistan, where he fought with the Taliban. Now he is being
held by the U.S. military and is charged with conspiracy to kill U.S.
citizens and providing aid to terrorists. If convicted, he faces life in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's parents referred all questions to their lawyer, James
Brosnahan. His spokeswoman had no comment on Lindh's stay in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic experts said that in his naivete, Lindh, a baptized Roman
Catholic who converted to Islam at 16, fell into a trap so common that
Muhammad himself predicted it.</TE>
<TE>   "A person who might have been living a typical happy-go-lucky life and
then he really gets very much attracted to the teaching of Islam and its
ideals, but then he wants to change overnight--that's what the prophet
actually was teaching against," said Jamal Badawi of the Islamic
Information Foundation in Halifax, Nova Scotia. "He said, 'Go gently.' "</TE>

<HD>U.S. Search for Information on Terrorists Goes Underground</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE VOGEL</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. forces are searching cave complexes and bunkers in eastern
Afghanistan to find information that U.S. officials say could be used to
thwart further terrorist attacks by the Al Qaeda network, the commander
of American forces in the region said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. personnel already are in possession of computers, hard drives and
diaries, as well as "several filing cabinets full of documentary evidence
that we have taken out and are in the process of going through very
methodically right now," Gen. Tommy Franks, the head of the U.S. Central
Command, told reporters.</LD>
<LD>   Franks said the search is focused around the towns of Khost and
Gardez, an area in the vicinity of a massive cave complex at Zhawar Kili
that was subjected to nearly two weeks of airstrikes this month. Defense
Department officials have said the region includes pockets of Al Qaeda
and Taliban resistance.</LD>
<TE>   "We have forces there now, working with Afghan units, out finding and
working our way through some of these cave complexes and bunker sites,"
Franks said, adding: "We're in a hurry to get to them, because . . . we
want to preempt the possibility of a future attack or gain insights into
that."</TE>
<TE>   There are signs that the information being acquired in Afghanistan is
reaping some benefits for the U.S.-led war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department on Thursday released excerpts of videotapes
recently discovered in the bombed house of slain Al Qaeda commander
Muhammad Atef showing five men who it said may be planning suicide
attacks against Western targets. U.S. officials credit seized information
with foiling attacks planned in Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   Although officials have not connected them with the
intelligence-collection effort, there has been a new round of arrests of
suspected terrorists in recent days in the Philippines, Bosnia and
Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Franks, without offering specific examples, said the information being
uncovered in Afghanistan is being used to build a "mosaic" to combat
terrorism around the globe. "It would be accurate to say insights have
been gained, such as the insights into the potential problem in
Singapore," Franks said.</TE>
<TE>   Franks offered no information, however, about whether the U.S.
government had learned anything new about the whereabouts of Al Qaeda
leader Osama bin Laden, who is charged with last year's attacks on the
United States, or Mohammad Omar, head of Afghanistan's deposed Taliban
regime that sheltered bin Laden's fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Franks and other U.S. officials discounted comments made Friday by
Pakistan President Gen. Perez Musharraf, in which he said Bin Laden is
probably dead because he was unable to get treatment for a kidney
ailment.</TE>
<TE>   "I would give the first priority that he is dead and the second
priority that he is alive somewhere in Afghanistan," Musharraf said in an
interview with CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to comment, Franks said, "I've received no intelligence to that
effect. . . . I've not seen anything in intelligence that would confirm
or deny that."</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. official said the CIA also had no information to support
Musharraf's statement.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf told CNN that Pakistan had information that Bin Laden took
two dialysis machines into Afghanistan. "One was specifically for his own
personal use," Musharraf said. He said Bin Laden may not have been able
to receive treatment since the U.S. military campaign began last fall.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official said, "We don't have any evidence that he has been on
kidney dialysis." The official added, "There have been rumors that he has
health problems, maybe kidney stones."</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Wednesday that Bin Laden is
likely still in Afghanistan, but Franks seemed less confident of this
Friday. "We really don't know where he is, whether he's in Afghanistan or
whether he may have left," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Franks vowed Bin Laden would be found. "The world is not a large
enough place for him to hide," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In his comments Friday, Franks characterized the work by U.S. forces
in eastern Afghanistan more as an intelligence-gathering effort than a
manhunt.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to information, Franks said, the forces have found
significant amounts of ammunition and equipment. "We have found an awful
lot," Franks said. "We have learned an awful lot. We have not yet found
any weapons of mass destruction. We have found potential. We have
certainly found a desire on the part of Al Qaeda to have weapons of mass
destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Franks said U.S. forces are receiving assistance from Afghan tribal
leaders. "We have found with the tribal shuras in the area is that they
remain ready to cooperate with us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross
arrived Friday at the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where the
military is holding 110 Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees. The Red Cross
officials have not yet spoken to the prisoners, Franks said. Some human
rights groups have raised concerns about the treatment of the detainees.</TE>
<TE>   For U.S. commanders, the prisoners may hold more secrets that could
lead to further intelligence gains, Franks said. "The first thing we know
is that we want to interrogate these detainees for intelligence value,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Special Forces Make Camp in Philippine Jungle</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philippine troops have set up a jungle camp for U.S. Special Forces
who will train local soldiers in missions designed to wipe out a Muslim
extremist group linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network, a
military spokesman said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The "forward base" is on the southern island of Basilan, where the Abu
Sayyaf guerrillas are holding an American couple hostage, said Capt. Noel
Detoyato of the Philippine military.</LD>
<LD>   About 7,000 Philippine soldiers have been deployed to Basilan in a
major offensive, but the 800-strong Abu Sayyaf has eluded capture for
months after starting a wave of kidnappings last May.</LD>
<TE>   Detoyato said it appears the guerrillas are hiding in jungle caves
with their remaining hostages-- missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham of
Wichita, Kan., and Philippine nurse Deborah Yap--complicating the search.</TE>
<TE>   Five American soldiers met with Philippine army commanders and
logistics officers Saturday at the main army camp on Basilan outside the
provincial capital, Isabela. He said they did not visit the forward base.</TE>
<TE>   The five are part of an advance team of about two dozen troops. About
660 U.S. soldiers, including 160 Special Forces, are to take part in the
training exercise. Most will be support and maintenance personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said U.S. troops will be allowed to visit the front lines to
assess the equipment needs and training for Philippine soldiers. The U.S.
troops cannot engage guerrillas in combat, but they can defend
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Saturday, Philippine officials said a cache of explosives
they seized in a southern city after arresting an Indonesian man last
week was intended for bombing attacks in Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said more than a ton of TNT was unearthed Thursday after
authorities arrested Fathur Rohman Ghozi of Indonesia on suspicion that
he was part of a Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell intercepted recently in
Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   Police found the explosives and arrested three men Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Spanish Police Arrest 2 Al Qaeda Suspects</HD>
<DH>Europe: The men, a Moroccan and an Algerian, had been on the run
since November raid, ministry says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MADRID
</DL>
<LD>Police arrested two suspected members of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
terrorist network Saturday. The pair had been on the run since a major
raid against the organization late last year, Spain's Interior Ministry
said.</LD>
<LD>   The two men, a Moroccan and an Algerian, were arrested on a warrant by
Judge Baltasar Garzon as part of an operation that jailed eight men in
Spain last November for their alleged role in the Sept. 11 attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Bin Laden is the prime suspect in
the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   A statement from Interior Ministry headquarters in Madrid said the two
were arrested in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, a sprawling suburban area
near Barcelona. The Moroccan was identified as Mohamed Najib Chaib, 35,
and the Algerian as 31-year-old Atmane Resali.</LD>
<TE>   The ministry, which oversees national security, said the two had lived
in Madrid in an apartment belonging to Luis Jose Galan, one of the eight
jailed in November. They fled the Spanish capital when the eight men were
arrested but were eventually traced to a relative's apartment in
L'Hospitalet.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Garzon said Galan was trained at a camp run by Bin Laden
in Indonesia in July 2001. Arms, ammunition, machetes and forged identity
documents were seized at Galan's apartment, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Garzon jailed the eight men, charging them with being Al Qaeda members
and with taking part in preparations for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities had been gathering evidence against them in Spain for
nearly a decade before they were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   In his jailing order, the magistrate said the eight "were directly
linked to the preparation and carrying out of the attacks perpetrated by
'suicide pilots' on Sept. 11, 2001, and which caused thousands of
deaths."</TE>
<TE>   The judge said there was convincing evidence the eight men "formed
part of an extremist Islamic group of a terrorist nature integrated in
the support and development structure of the Al Qaeda organization's
criminal activities."</TE>
<TE>   Garzon said the eight were involved in preparing Islamic guerrillas
and providing cover for others in Spain and Europe. They also raised
money for the organization, mainly through stolen credit cards and
robberies.</TE>
<TE>   The two arrested Saturday are likely to be brought to Madrid for
questioning and possible jailing. The eight already in prison will remain
there while Garzon prepares a case for trial against them.</TE>

<HD>Key Afghan Tunnel Reopens After Cleanup</HD>

<DL>SALANG PASS, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Shivering Afghan and Russian leaders Saturday officially reopened
the Salang Tunnel, the highest in the world at 11,034 feet, after workers
cleared tons of debris left over from warfare in the late 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty trucks loaded with Russian food and medicines for needy Afghans
made up the first convoy to travel south through the dimly lighted tunnel
under the snowcapped Hindu Kush mountains.</LD>
<LD>   Russian and Afghan workers, helped by British and French
nongovernmental organizations, cleared the 1.6-mile tunnel in a month to
reopen the main artery linking northern and southern Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to boosting private traffic and trade, the tunnel will be
a major conduit for humanitarian aid coming from Russia and the Central
Asian republics and for refugees returning from neighboring Pakistan to
their homes in the north.</TE>
<TE>   The tunnel, built by the Soviet Union and opened in 1964, was a major
supply route for Soviet troops during their 1980s occupation of
Afghanistan. Communist convoys were often attacked along the steep
approaches on either side.</TE>
<TE>   "We greatly appreciate the work of the four organizations that have
helped us clear up the tunnel," said Afghan Public Works Minister Abdul
Khaliq Fazal during a short ceremony at the northern end of the tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   Russian and Afghan workers, some with the French charity ACTED, worked
together with de-miners from Britain's HALO Trust to clear mounds of
rubble left after opposition fighters destroyed both entrances in 1997 in
their war against the Taliban.</TE>

<DH>Lifestyles: Children of circus performers must jump through special
hoops as they travel across the country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA IRVINE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>They explore the old Boeing 727 as any group of students on a
museum field trip might. They punch buttons, try out the passenger seats
and pretend they're about to take off on a long journey.</LD>
<LD>   But when told what the plane weighs--165,000 pounds, or about as much
as 10 elephants--several children, even one of the youngest, nod
knowingly.</LD>
<LD>   "Ohhh," the first-grader says. "We have 10 elephants at home."</LD>
<TE>   If life for them sounds like a bit of a circus, it is--the Ringling
Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey circus. They are the children of acrobats,
trapeze artists, animal keepers and others who travel the country nearly
year-round with their families in tow.</TE>
<TE>   For the kids, life on the road can be an education in itself. They get
to visit sites many students only read about, from Bunker Hill to the
U.S. Mint to, in this case, Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry.
It's one of the advantages of their journey by train, truck and trailer
with a circus that--elephants and all--has been described as the largest
city without a ZIP code.</TE>
<TE>   But on many days, the school in this town comes in the form of a
teacher who travels with them, providing a steady routine of homework and
tests even as the scenery changes.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the most glamorous side of the "Greatest Show on Earth."
School accommodations are often cramped.</TE>
<TE>   "We make do with what we have," says Brenda Shaw, teacher for the
Ringling Bros. "red unit," one of two shows that crisscross the country.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, it's a small, L-shaped dressing room at the United Center,
which hosts the circus and other shows when the city's professional
basketball and hockey teams aren't playing. Someone has dubbed it
"Escuelita Bonita"--Spanish for beautiful little school--on a piece of
masking tape stuck over the doorway label.</TE>
<TE>   Beautiful isn't exactly the word for it.</TE>
<TE>   The windowless room only has space for a few tables, folding chairs
and a large wooden box on rollers that carries the school's supplies from
place to place.</TE>
<TE>   But Miss Shaw, as her students call her, has done her best to brighten
the walls with student artwork and strings of leaves cut out of red,
orange and yellow construction paper.</TE>
<TE>   The students and their varied backgrounds also enliven classes.
Whitney Boger, 15, is a ninth-grader and the oldest of Shaw's nine
students. Her father is "superintendent of animals," and her mother works
in wardrobe.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Gaspar, 12, is the music director's son. Nine-year-old Virginia
Torres, a fourth-grader, comes from a long line of Mexican acrobats.</TE>
<TE>   And 7-year-old Kristina Majhartseza--who came from Russia less than a
year ago--is the daughter of an acrobat and a dancer, who both perform in
the circus.</TE>
<TE>   Older kids attend class in the morning; younger ones in the afternoon.
The half days might sound enticing to those who go to conventional
school, but there's a catch.</TE>
<TE>   Students attend class on any day the circus has shows scheduled. So
that means they often go six--and sometimes seven--days a week.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a Sno-Cone and cotton-candy diet," Whitney says.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, she likes to shop at the mall and go to movies in any town she
visits, she says. In fact, she and her classmates spend much more time
doing things like that than watching the circus, which by now is old hat.
Watching TV, walking dogs and playing games with each other also rank
high on their lists.</TE>
<TE>   But much of the students' time is spent on schoolwork.</TE>
<TE>   One morning in the Chicago classroom, Whitney takes a science test on
thermal energy, while Virginia does fractions. Aaron works on
seventh-grade pre-algebra problems, as Shaw moves from student to
student, giving instructions and answering questions.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents with Ringling Bros. see the arrangement as a trade-off
when compared with traditional school. Carrie Valentin has put her
6-year-old daughter, Lexie, both in Shaw's class and an Indianapolis
elementary school during the off season.</TE>
<TE>   "I do feel bad about that these kids don't get a chance to run around
much, like at recess," says Valentin, who works in the show's day-care
department. But she says Lexie also gets individual attention from Shaw
that she could never get in a classroom of 30 children.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw, who joined the circus in September, says she's already noted the
positive effects of a life that teaches adaptability and exposes the kids
to people from all walks of life.</TE>
<TE>   "All of them are a lot more mature for their age, very bright for the
most part," Shaw says. "I mean, they're kids. They fight like brothers
and sisters. But they're a really tight-knit group--very good-natured,
always willing to help."</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Katz, a former Ringling Bros. teacher who now lives in San
Francisco, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "They're pretty savvy, very verbal," she says, "probably because
they're used to being around adults."</TE>
<TE>   That's certainly true of Aaron, whose travels have made him conversant
on such topics as the politics of Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   But he and others say life on the road does have a downside. They
often talk about missing friends and family and the homes they go to in
December, the off season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to see the country, but there is this stuff that goes with
it," Aaron says, noting that during 2000, he and his family visited 42
states. "It can be very isolating"</TE>
<TE>   He says he'd like to return to a town outside Rochester, N.Y., where
he once lived with his family and even got to play on a baseball team.
But for now, he shares one of two rooms his family has on the train with
his 2-year-old brother.</TE>
<TE>   "If my little brother wants to take a nap, I have to go in the other
room," he says, sighing.</TE>
<TE>   Circus officials say the adjustment can be even more difficult for the
teacher, who lives in one small room on the train, and on any given day,
could find an acrobat warming up outside the school doorway or a herd of
zebras running by.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to find teachers," says Mark Gaipo, the red unit's general
manager, who plays the role of both "mayor" and "principal." "But to find
one who fits and who can persevere in this environment, that's not so
easy."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Shaw seems to be adapting well. The 26-year-old Rhode Islander
had been teaching at an elementary school in her home state but joined
the circus, in part, to see the country.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it. You get to know the students and their parents in a way
that you never would" in a more traditional setting, she says, adding
that she could imagine staying a few years.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Army Takes Over Marines' Afghan Base</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A famed U.S. Army paratrooper division took over the largest
American military installation in Afghanistan on Saturday, taking command
from Marines who were returning to their ships.</LD>
<LD>   The hand-over was accomplished without a formal ceremony. The switch
has been underway for a few days, with troops from the 101st Airborne
Division relieving Marines from bunkers along the perimeter of the base
established at Kandahar's airport.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Marines are shifting nonessential personnel, they will
"retain the capacity for any missions that might pop up," said Marine
spokesman Lt. James D. Jarvis.</LD>
<TE>   The base--in the former heartland of the Islamic extremist Taliban
regime--remains tense more than a month after the Marines arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Troops report frequent sightings of armed men outside the perimeter,
and the base came under fire recently during the first flight carrying Al
Qaeda and Taliban prisoners from a temporary detention facility to a
high-security jail at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a man claiming to have significant information about the
Taliban showed up at the gate. He remained under interrogation Saturday,
said Army spokesman Maj. Ignacio Perez, who declined to say whether the
man was being formally held or would be free to leave if he wished.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,000 Marines were at the Kandahar base at the height of their
deployment, and military officials declined to say how many would remain
as the Army takes over. Dispensing with base duties would free some
Marines for quick deployment on other missions.</TE>
<TE>   The United States raised the specter of renewed foreign meddling in
Afghanistan on Friday, saying Iran might be sending pro-Iranian Afghan
fighters to destabilize the newly installed U.S.-backed government.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, stopped short
of directly accusing Iran of interference, but he cited unspecified
reports that Afghan fighters and money were being sent from Iran into the
volatile country to build opposition to interim Prime Minister Hamid
Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   "All of those things would be regarded as interference," Khalilzad
said in Kabul, the capital.</TE>

<HD>A Little Knowledge Is Good For What Ails You</HD>
<DH>Health: There are so many misconceptions about staying healthy and
becoming ill that it can make you dizzy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUSTIN GLANVILLE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no such thing as stomach flu. And no, you shouldn't starve
a fever.</LD>
<LD>   With winter in full swing, Americans are sniffling and sneezing by the
millions, falling prey to flu, colds, strep throat and other common
illnesses of the season. Yet most know little about what is making them
sick or how best to treat their illnesses.</LD>
<LD>   "People have a real misunderstanding about what causes their
symptoms," says Dr. Jim Martin of San Antonio, president-elect of the
American Academy of Family Physicians. "And most of us are not very
sophisticated about which problems are serious ones that require a doctor
visit."</LD>
<TE>   Two of the season's most dreaded illnesses, cold and flu, are also two
of the most misunderstood. Many people use the terms "flu" and "cold"
interchangeably, although they are very different diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Flu is a harsher illness that can lead to dangerous complications such
as pneumonia in the elderly and those with weak immune systems. In
general, flu hits harder and faster than a cold. A sudden high fever and
severe body aches are its hallmarks.</TE>
<TE>   Colds, meanwhile, are usually heralded by sneezing, congestion and a
low-grade fever (or none at all). Complications are generally less
serious. "True flu is almost always an acute process," says Martin.</TE>
<TE>   People often complain of "stomach flu," an illness that, strictly
speaking, doesn't exist. The influenza virus that causes flu affects only
the respiratory (breathing) system, not the digestive tract. Upset
stomachs are caused by other germs, including a variety of viruses and
food-borne bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   Patients are often misinformed about what leads to illness in winter.
Whatever your parents told you, you can't get sick merely by walking
outside in cold weather without a hat, or from having a wet head or feet.</TE>
<TE>   Colds, flu, strep throat and other common illnesses are passed through
contact--for example, touching a computer keyboard, doorknob or telephone
after a sick person has used it, or sitting next to someone who is
coughing and sniffling on a bus.</TE>
<TE>   Exposure to a cold environment can make people vulnerable to illness
in extreme cases, such as falling into icy water or being stranded
outdoors in a blizzard. "If you get chilled enough, some of the immune
systems in your lungs might not work as well," says cold expert Dr. Jack
Gwaltney of the University of Virginia School of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   But even then, viruses and bacteria--not the cold environment
itself--are the true culprits.</TE>
<TE>   Popular wisdom on how to treat winter illnesses ranges from the absurd
to the potentially harmful.</TE>
<TE>   One adage, "starve a fever, feed a cold"--or is it the other way
around?--has no merit whatsoever, doctors say. The idea of depriving any
sick person of food is "totally off the wall," says Gwaltney. "I have no
idea where that came from."</TE>
<TE>   It's best to maintain a steady, nutritious diet during bouts with both
cold and fever-inducing illnesses, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Often, people who are sick with flu or a cold press their doctors for
antibiotics, in the hopes of a speedier recovery. But colds and flu are
caused by viruses, not bacteria, so antibiotics are useless in treating
them.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, overusing drugs helps germs develop defenses against treatment.
"We don't want to help the bugs any more than we have to," says Gwaltney.
Doctors and patients should use antibiotics to treat only true bacterial
infections, such as strep throat and some types of pneumonia, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Unpleasant as they are, symptoms such as fever and coughing are often
best left to run their course. A low-grade fever is the body's way of
"burning off" offending germs, and coughing helps clear the lungs of
infected secretions.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some doctors say, an occasional swig of cough suppressant can't
hurt if a persistent hack is interfering with sleep.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, rest and drinking plenty of fluids remain the cornerstones of
a speedy recovery. The more rest a person gets, the more energy his or
her body has to make immune-system regulators, such as interferon. "If
you go out and run for three miles, your body isn't going to be able to
make as much interferon," Martin says.</TE>
<TE>   Fluids help flush infected cells from the body and help the kidneys
function more efficiently.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, many Americans have enlisted over-the-counter
remedies such as zinc and echinacea in their battles with colds and flu.
Experts are divided on whether those treatments work, however. Martin
says he wouldn't prescribe herbal remedies to patients, because studies
on their effectiveness have been inconclusive. But he wouldn't expressly
advise people not to take them, either.</TE>
<TE>   Vitamin C, that granddaddy of home remedies, gets mixed reviews. Some
studies have shown that it can shorten the duration of illness, while
others say it neither prevents nor helps alleviate symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Medical experts say prevention remains the best treatment. Flu shots
are a good idea, particularly for the elderly and chronically ill.
Otherwise, Martin says, "just do what you learned in the eighth
grade"--cover your mouth when you cough, wash your hands after touching
shared property and maintain a healthy diet.</TE>

<HD>Coast Guard Gets Lifeline</HD>
<DH>Security: The struggling agency is receiving more respect and
funding consideration since Sept. 11 attacks.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>For years, tight budgets have reduced the Coast Guard to protecting
the nation's ports with a fleet older than Argentina's navy and a
uniformed force no bigger than it was in the 1960s. It has had to forgo
patrolling for drug smugglers and illegal fishing boats just so it could
pay its fuel bills.</LD>
<LD>   But the Rodney Dangerfield of the nation's defense network has been
getting a lot more respect since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks elevated
its role. White House budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., conferring
new status on the aging agency, said: "Clearly, the Coast Guard is a
principal pillar of the new homeland security."</LD>
<LD>   From the Pentagon to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
the new budget will be generous to agencies that fight terrorism at home
and abroad, White House officials say. For the Coast Guard, the
administration is considering asking Congress for about $6 billion in
2003, up from $5 billion this year.</LD>
<TE>   The billion-dollar increase would help the Coast Guard meet its
expanded responsibilities in the short term, said Loren Thompson, a
defense analyst at the Lexington Institute, a conservative think tank in
Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "What it won't do," he said, "is begin modernizing a decrepit fleet."</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard's mission includes patrolling for threats along 95,000
miles of coastline and safeguarding the nation from 6.5 million
passengers and millions of cargo containers arriving at U.S. ports every
year.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, it must carry out a host of secondary duties, such as
plucking boating accident victims from the sea, chasing drug smugglers,
keeping foreign fishing vessels from poaching in U.S. waters and breaking
ice floes that block waterway traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard is doing all this with ships that, with an average age
of 28 years, have become the Ramblers of the sea. In 2000, a lifeboat
support snapped on a 58-year-old cutter that was tracking a foreign boat
fishing in U.S. waters, sending the lifeboat and nine crew members into
the Bering Sea. The crew was rescued, but the foreign vessel got away.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there remains widespread ignorance of just how spread thin
the service is and how unsustainable the service's current exertions
are," said Stephen E. Flynn, a senior fellow for national security
studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a Coast Guard commander
himself.</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles and Long Beach port, the nation's largest, the need
is acute, according to Capt. J.M. Holmes, the Coast Guard's commanding
officer there. He said the Guard's posture shifted from passive to active
on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Like a fire department, we used to have guys waiting for something
terrible to happen so they could go out and save someone," Holmes said.
"Now we are in a prevention mode, like a police department, and spending
a huge amount of our budget on homeland security. We have to have boats
in the water at all times so that when people drive over a port bridge
and look down, they can see a Coast Guard cutter."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many port commanders, Holmes boasts of a new coastal fleet: "We
just got four brand-new coastal patrol boats, and we're replacing our
41-foot utility boats. But our deep-water fleet of 210-foot and 270-foot
boats is very, very old and technically behind the times."</TE>
<TE>   And Holmes' resources are stretched to the limit.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been running our people, boats and equipment far harder than
they are supposed to be run," he said. "But as we extend the nation's
virtual border farther out to sea, we need to enforce our deep-water
program with new high-tech boats and equipment to stop the bad guys
before they get to shore."</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard patrols the harbor 24 hours a day, and it escorts all
large passenger cruise ships to dock. It also checks lists of passengers,
crews and cargo arriving at ports, and boards vessels that it considers
high-risk.</TE>
<TE>   To better react in emergencies, the Coast Guard is creating small-boat
units that will be strategically located at certain port cities,
including Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of these units will consist of at least six small, fast boats,
and they'll be rapidly deployable in the event of an increased risk,"
Holmes said. "If something happened at San Francisco or any West Coast
port, we'd be able to get the unit there in a hurry."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn cautioned that the Coast Guard's few advocates in Congress have
tended to provide sporadic infusions of cash for particular programs of
interest to the voters back home, such as drug and migrant interdiction
and fisheries protection. "But there are no political points for
maintaining and modernizing the Guard's ships, aircraft and
communications or for training and housing the people who carry out those
missions."</TE>
<TE>   For 2002, Congress approved a 9% increase in the Coast Guard
budget--and it provided $209 million more in post-Sept. 11 emergency
funds. That brought the Coast Guard's annual budget up to $5 billion,
one-third of the amount Congress spent to bail out financially strapped
commercial airlines after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. William D. Delahunt (D-Mass.), a former guardsman, said the Sept.
11 attacks should provide all the reason Congress needs to bring the
Coast Guard into the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand we've got to be concerned about deficits," he said. "But
you can't do this on the cheap. We were doing it on the cheap before
Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Schwadron, Delahunt's chief of staff, added: "The problem over
the years is that the Coast Guard has been the poor sister to the
Pentagon."</TE>
<TE>   "It is essentially a public policy orphan," Flynn said. "Historically,
there have been no powerful constituencies in either the executive or
legislative branches who advocated for the service's overall vitality."</TE>
<TE>   Some have proposed bringing the Coast Guard--along with a number of
other federal agencies involved in homeland defense--under the
president's Office of Homeland Security. It currently is part of the
Department of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard's uniformed force of 35,952 is about the same size as
it was in 1967. Staffing hit a peak of 39,424 in 1992 before a 12%
downsizing in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "A plus-up of 10% would essentially arrest the downward spiral the
service was in prior to Sept. 11 without providing the nation much more
in the way of additional capacity to advance maritime and port security,"
Flynn said. He estimated that the service needed a 60% to 70% increase
over the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the Coast Guard has scaled back its efforts to catch
drug smugglers and enforce fisheries laws to better safeguard harbors
against terrorists, according to a congressional report.</TE>
<TE>   Daniels, the White House budget director, said he was confident that
the Coast Guard could fulfill its traditional missions as well as its
expanded role in homeland defense.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Howard Coble (R-N.C.), a former guardsman, urged Coast Guard
leaders to be less timid in their quest for more dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "The Coast Guard has been like the unwelcome stepchild at a family
reunion," he said. "That may change now."</TE>

<HD>Bush Seeks Rise in School Aid for Poor, Disabled</HD>
<DH>Budget: The president wants large increases in two federal
programs. Resistance is expected in Congress from both sides of the
aisle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Moving to make education one of the defining domestic issues of his
administration, President Bush on Saturday called for billion-dollar
increases in federal funding for programs serving disabled and
disadvantaged students.</LD>
<LD>   If approved by Congress, the increases would allow the Bush White
House to reasonably claim to be among the most committed administrations
in recent history to expanding key areas of federal education spending.</LD>
<LD>   Bush used his weekly radio address to call for billion-dollar
increases in two prominent programs. The first, known as Title I, gives
school districts money intended to help low-income students and is the
largest federal education program. The second, known as the Individuals
With Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, requires schools to accommodate
students with disabilities.</LD>
<TE>   Noting Monday's federal holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., Bush called persistent gaps in student achievement "the great civil
rights issue of our time."</TE>
<TE>   "Americans can proudly say that we have overcome the institutionalized
bigotry that Dr. King fought," Bush said. "Now our challenge is to make
sure that every child has a fair chance to succeed in life."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement came less than two weeks after Bush signed a landmark
education-reform bill that requires states to impose new performance
standards on students and teachers. That bill is one of the truly
bipartisan legislative achievements of his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats welcomed Bush's proposal but noted that the president has
not yet specified how much money other important education programs will
get. They said even this latest plan falls short of certain federal
funding obligations.</TE>
<TE>   "Democrats on Capitol Hill are still going to complain that it doesn't
fully fund the promises made in the education bill that was just signed
into law," said Jim Manley, a spokesman for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Education Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The plan also may prompt some sniping from conservatives, who question
the track record of the programs into which Bush proposes pouring
billions of dollars in new money.</TE>
<TE>   But in calling for such substantial increases, Bush is affirming his
commitment to education and making it a symbol of his self-described
"compassionate conservatism."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's education agenda has benefited him politically. In recent
polls, Americans asked whom they trusted most to improve education, put
the president on even footing with congressional Democrats.
Traditionally, Democrats have had the advantage on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Few other domestic programs are expected to get significant funding
increases in Bush's proposed budget, scheduled for release Feb. 4, for
the 2003 fiscal year. Most increases are expected to be related to the
war on terrorism, including defense and homeland security programs.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Bush proposed boosting funding for Title I to $11.35
billion in the fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1. That comes on top of a
$1.6-billion increase this year.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials noted that if Congress approves the
president's request, the Title I budget will have grown 30% over the last
two years, or nearly as much as it grew during all eight years of the
Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District has been among the largest
beneficiaries. Last year's increase boosted Title I funding for the
district by $87.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many conservatives have criticized Title I, saying it is an
expensive program that has shown little measurable success. Indeed,
studies show that the performance gap between poor students and their
more affluent peers has not narrowed significantly.</TE>
<TE>   The recently signed education bill includes provisions designed to
hold school districts more accountable for their use of the funds.
Schools that fail to show progress will, in some cases, be forced to
surrender Title I funds given to students' families to hire after-school
tutors.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics say those reforms didn't go far enough and express
concern that the Bush White House could exacerbate the problem by putting
more money into the program.</TE>
<TE>   "The fundamental fact about Title I is that we've poured hundreds of
millions of dollars into it and have not had the kind of performance for
students we would expect," said Bill Moffit, director of domestic policy
studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. "Hopefully
the expenditure of new funds will coincide with a greater emphasis on
getting a good return."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also called for a billion-dollar increase in federal funding for
students with disabilities. An estimated 6.5 million students nationwide
qualify for special assistance under the 1970s-era IDEA.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the proposal would raise the appropriation for IDEA
grants to $8.5 billion in the next fiscal year. The money goes toward
helping districts hire additional classroom aides, provide counseling or
make other accommodations.</TE>
<TE>   IDEA funding increased $1.2 billion this year. White House officials
noted that the latest Bush request would represent a funding increase of
124% for the program over the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats said that even Bush's latest proposal leaves the federal
government well short of its original funding commitment to the program.
IDEA called on the government to provide 40% of the funding schools need
to implement the law's requirements. Currently, the federal government
covers about 16% of the cost and municipalities shoulder the rest, often
by raising property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   IDEA funding has been a thorny issue for the administration, largely
because it is a pet program of Sen. James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.). A
principal architect of the law, Jeffords quit the Republican Party last
year partly because of his frustration with GOP opposition to fully
funding the program. Jeffords' switch caused Republicans to lose control
of the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffords said Saturday that Bush's latest proposal remains inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   "In this era of trillion-dollar tax cuts and shrinking state education
budgets, this increase falls short," he said. "The federal government
promised to provide 40% of special education costs more than 25 years
ago. I think it's time to meet that commitment."</TE>
<TE>   Fully funding IDEA would cost $18 billion annually, a Jeffords aide
said.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A winter storm battered East Coast cities from Washington to New
York on Saturday, blanketing the Middle Atlantic region with its first
significant snowfall of the season.</LD>
<LD>   The system brought wet snow and sleet to the nation's capital,
triggering cancellations of school and community activities along the
Eastern Seaboard.</LD>
<LD>   Suburban communities called emergencies as thousands of snow-clearing
vehicles, including plows and salt trucks, set out before sunset to keep
roadways clear.</LD>
<TE>   Winter storm warnings were posted for parts of West Virginia,
Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York.</TE>
<TE>   About 5 inches of snow had fallen in New York City's suburbs Saturday
evening, but there were few disruptions downtown, where less than 2
inches fell in Central Park.</TE>
<TE>   In other states, dozens of cars and trucks slid off roads.</TE>
<TE>   Locally heavy snow blanketed West Virginia and some neighboring areas
of Kentucky and Virginia during the morning.</TE>
<TE>   Northbound Interstate 79 was closed by a tractor-trailer accident near
Fairmont, W.Va., and dozens of other accidents were reported elsewhere
around the state, where 5 inches to 9 inches of snow was possible.</TE>
<TE>   Work continued at the World Trade Center site in New York. Snow on the
rubble melted, making conditions muddy and slippery for rescue workers.</TE>
<TE>   New York City's Sanitation Department sent out 240 snowplows Saturday
night, but the city had 1,400 plows, 353 salt spreaders and more than
220,800 tons of salt on standby.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEWPORT, Tenn.
</DL>
<LD>Rain and drums drowned out the words of two dozen members of the Ku
Klux Klan at a rally Saturday held days after a wooden cross was burned
on the lawn of the town's first black mayor.</LD>
<LD>   The rally, the first public Klan event in the region in decades, fell
on Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's birthday and two days before Martin
Luther King Day.</LD>
<LD>   Klan organizers said the town of 7,100 was selected because it was a
convenient location, not because it has a black mayor. They denied
involvement in the cross burning early Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   About 800 people attended a diversity festival Saturday held to
counter the Klan event. Mayor Roland Dykes received a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time for Americans to renounce the protests of a vocal
minority, which opposes our fight to preserve and promote freedom," Dykes
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Klan rally, about 400 people watched from behind yellow police
tape, chanting and playing drums to drown out the Klan's remarks.</TE>
<TE>   More than 125 state troopers stood shoulder to shoulder in riot gear
between the audience and the KKK. There were four arrests for public
drunkenness but no fights.</TE>
<TE>   The leader of the Church of the Knights of Yahweh, the
Morristown-based KKK branch behind the rally, said afterward that he
realized it was hard to hear but that the news media were not paying
attention to what the Klan had to say on issues anyway.</TE>

<HD>Offer of Free Abortions on Roe Anniversary</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WICHITA, Kan.
</DL>
<LD>A doctor who once was shot by an anti-abortion protester marked the
29th anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade decision that made abortion legal by
offering the procedure free Saturday, a move that drew more than 100
protesters to his clinic.</LD>
<LD>   With the demonstrators yelling and praying from beyond a fence, Dr.
George Tiller spoke to 65 supporters and warned them that abortion rights
are at a fragile point.</LD>
<LD>   Former President Clinton thwarted opponents' attempts to curb access
to abortions, legalized by a Supreme Court decision Jan. 22, 1973.
President Bush, however, opposes abortion, and conservatives in Congress
and several states have pushed for restrictions.</LD>
<TE>   In a proclamation Friday, Bush declared today to be National Sanctity
of Human Life Day. "Unborn children should be welcomed in life and
protected in law," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tiller said at least 32 low-income women signed up for the free
first-trimester abortions. Protesters called the offer a publicity stunt.</TE>

<HD>Runoff Set in Dallas Mayor Race</HD>
<DH>Election: Two candidates will face off Feb. 16 in bid to replace
Ron Kirk, who quit to run for Senate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS
</DL>
<LD>Former newspaper columnist and City Councilwoman Laura Miller and
well-connected businessman Tom Dunning will face each other in a runoff
election next month in the city's heated mayoral race.</LD>
<LD>   With all precincts reporting Saturday night, Miller had 48.8% of the
vote, ahead of Dunning's 39%. Democratic state Rep. Domingo Garcia
finished with 11.1%.</LD>
<LD>   Because no candidate got more than 50% of the vote in the nonpartisan
election, Miller and Dunning will go into the Feb. 16 runoff.</LD>
<TE>   Two little-known contenders also were vying to replace former Mayor
Ron Kirk, who resigned in November to run for the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk, a Democrat hoping to follow Phil Gramm into the Senate when the
Republican retires after this year, had a legacy of big projects as
Dallas mayor, shepherding the $420-million American Airlines Center and
the Trinity River redevelopment project in blighted South Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates seeking to replace him largely promoted a
back-to-basics campaign, emphasizing street repairs, park improvements
and putting more police officers on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "This campaign is about one thing: returning City Hall to the city of
Dallas," Miller, who once worked as a columnist for an alternative weekly
newspaper in Dallas, told about 500 supporters Saturday night at a
Western-themed party.</TE>
<TE>   "We are leading, we are winning, we are heading to victory," said
Miller, 43.</TE>
<TE>   Dunning, 59, an insurance agent, is a favorite of the business
community and is a former chairman of the Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport board. He raised nearly $1.5 million in campaign
contributions--twice as much as Miller.</TE>
<TE>   "The folks for Laura tend to vote early, so we expected that," Dunning
campaign spokeswoman Carol Reed said. "We expect that we'll be in a
runoff. I have prepared him for the early votes, and I thought we'd lose
by more than we lost by."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia raised about $200,000. Garcia, a 43-year-old personal injury
lawyer, also is a former councilman.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Democratic Party decided Saturday to allow states to hold their
presidential nominating contests more than a month earlier in 2004 than
they did in 2000, to follow the Republicans' front-loaded schedule.</LD>
<LD>   Under a measure approved on a voice vote at a meeting of about 300
elected members of the Democratic National Committee, a presidential
contender could have the party's nomination sewn up as early as February
2004.</LD>
<LD>   Proponents of the change contend it would better position Democrats to
challenge President Bush's reelection bid in 2004 by keeping candidates
in the public eye during February; Republicans held five state primaries
that month in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Leading Democrats also used the meeting to criticize Bush on economic
policy, an issue likely to play prominently during this year's
congressional elections as the federal budget heads into deficit for
fiscal year 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration seems to be running fiscal policy the way the
folks at Enron ran their company," Democratic Party Chairman Terry
McAuliffe said in reference to the bankruptcy of Enron Corp., a
Houston-based energy company.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats held no primary votes during February 2000 after the
traditional leadoff battles in Iowa and New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   The change does not require any state Democratic primaries to be
advanced, but allows state legislatures to schedule them in February
2004, especially if Republicans again schedule several of their contests
for that month.</TE>

<HD>Twists, Turns of Presidential Pretzel Crisis</HD>
<DH>Media: Any news agency worth its salt knows how to separate fact
from fiction in Bush caper. The lowdown on a 'savory snack.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB HIAASEN</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During a national esophageal crisis, it's more important than ever
to present the facts and work to dispel rumors:</LD>
<LD>   TRUE: President Bush, 55, fainted briefly last Sunday in the White
House after choking on a pretzel. The president, who was watching the
Baltimore Ravens-Miami Dolphins football wild card playoff game, quickly
recovered and was reportedly in fine health except for a scrape and
bruise on his face that came from his fall from the couch.</LD>
<LD>   FALSE: The Dolphins' doddering offense caused the president's choking
and subsequent loss of consciousness.</LD>
<TE>   TRUE: The president apparently experienced a "vasovagal syncope"
episode, whereby his coughing stimulated a nerve that triggered a
temporary decrease in his heart rate.</TE>
<TE>   FALSE: Fox News war correspondent Geraldo Rivera said the Lord's
Prayer over the "hallowed ground" where the president conked his head, as
the two presidential dogs looked on.</TE>
<TE>   TRUE: Headlines from international newspapers came down in buckets
Monday: "Bush in Pretzel Scare" (Scottish Daily Record), "Bush Faints
Over Biscuit" (The Mirror), "President Downed By Pretzel" (The Herald
Sun), and "Bush Finds Pretzel Hard to Swallow" (Calgary Herald).</TE>
<TE>   FALSE: In the United States, the pretzel is also called a biscuit.</TE>
<TE>   TRUE: Each fall, the Snack Food Assn.--a Virginia-based trade
group--sponsors its "exciting and fantastic" annual pretzel seminar. Last
November, in York, Pa., the 2001 Pretzel Seminar attracted more than 80
attendees and featured a tour of Stauffer's C-P Converters. "The 31
tabletop exhibits at the Wednesday afternoon lunch did a brisk business,"
reported the association's newsletter, the "Snack Report."</TE>
<TE>   FALSE: At last year's pretzel seminar, Britney Spears debuted her new
song, "I'm a Slave 4 U." Spears then joined the other attendees for a
round of golf at the Heritage Hills Golf Resort. Spears recorded a par-72
after members of her foursome agreed among themselves to fabricate her
score in hopes of prolonging her first visit to York, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   TRUE: Pretzel sales garner roughly 5% of the $20.69 billion "savory
snack" market in the United States, according to the Snack Food Assn.
Savory snacks include popcorn (not theater popcorn), potato chips,
tortilla snacks and meat snacks.</TE>
<TE>   FALSE: "Beef Jerky" pretzels are a leading savory snack.</TE>
<TE>   TRUE: Popular forms of pretzels include: twist, mini, sticks, rods,
nuggets, thin, knots, sourdough and filled.</TE>
<TE>   FALSE: Created in A.D. 610, the first known pretzels were used to
choke especially cranky monks in southern France.</TE>
<TE>   TRUE: Snack historians say pretzels were created in 1800 by monks who
spent long hours forming chunks of dough in the shape of a person's hand
while praying.</TE>
<TE>   FALSE: Vice President Dick Cheney, who watched the Ravens-Dolphins

<LD>The student accused of shooting two classmates at a high school had
taken a gun into the building through an unattended side door, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   Vincent Rodriguez, 18, was arraigned Saturday on charges including two
counts of attempted murder. He was ordered held without bail pending a
court appearance Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting took place Tuesday in a hallway at Martin Luther King Jr.
High School in Manhattan. Police said it appeared Rodriguez shot the two
because they had teased his girlfriend.</LD>
<TE>   The school's main entrance is equipped with metal detectors, but
investigators believe Rodriguez entered the school Tuesday morning
through a side door and hid the gun in a fire extinguisher box.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe he retrieved the weapon later for the shooting, Sgt.
Ralph Carone said.</TE>

<DL>TAMPA, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>A felon who fired his lawyer and represented himself has been
acquitted of murder charges.</LD>
<LD>   Ernest Spann, 35, who has an 11th-grade education, was tried three
times on murder and burglary charges connected to a 1991 slaying. After
deliberating three hours, the jury acquitted him Friday. He had faced
life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   "He gambled with his life and he won," said Assistant Public Defender
Harvey Hyman, who helped Spann.</LD>
<TE>   The charges involved the murder of Brenda McKenzie, 35, whose nude
body was found in her home in August 1991. She had been shot once in the
chest, and police say she died in a botched drug deal.</TE>
<TE>   At Spann's first trial last year, with a lawyer representing him, the
judge declared a mistrial when a juror held out for a not guilty verdict.
Months later, Spann insisted on representing himself, and the trial again
ended with a hung jury.</TE>
<TE>   The acquittal doesn't mean Spann goes free. He is serving a 13
1/2-year sentence on cocaine charges and is scheduled for release in
December 2008.</TE>

<HD>Voyage to the Edge of the Solar System Inspires Chills, Thrills</HD>
<DH>Space: Mission to frigid Pluto wins preliminary go-ahead.
Scientists anticipate the 10-year journey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL E. RUANE</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Dark, distant, named for the jealous Roman god of the dead and
often sheathed in frozen gases, Pluto has stalked the edge of the solar
system for eons--the only planet never visited by a spacecraft--in an
orbit around the sun that takes centuries to complete.</LD>
<LD>   So tiny and strange is Pluto, smaller than Earth's moon and rotating
at a weird angle, some scientists have questioned its long-held status as
the ninth planet.</LD>
<LD>   Now, after years of on-and-off effort, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration has received preliminary funding from Congress for a
mission to fling a spacecraft 3 billion miles or so to go take a look.</LD>
<TE>   The pioneering voyage is to take about 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's marvelous," said Andrew Cheng, 50, the mission's project
scientist, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in
Laurel, Md. "It's about the most exciting thing that we've done in a
long, long time."</TE>
<TE>   The "New Horizons" mission, which would be managed by the Applied
Physics Lab, also calls for the spacecraft to plunge beyond Pluto, into
the recently discovered and even more remote Kuiper Belt.</TE>
<TE>   There, some scientists believe, resides the frozen refuse of the solar
system's creation, which may include fledgling comets and weird
"planetoids" as big as, or perhaps bigger than, Pluto.</TE>
<TE>   The legendary outer planet--glimpsed through telescopes as a shadowy
golden orb--still is one of the solar system's great secrets, nearly 72
years after its discovery by an astronomer who was once a Kansas farm
boy.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been something we've worked on for 10 years," said S. Alan
Stern, 44, the mission's lead investigator and director of the Southwest
Research Institute's Department of Space Studies in Boulder, Colo. "When
I started, I was 30 years old. This will be my life's work. This is my
contribution. It's so gratifying that we're finally going to get to do
this."</TE>
<TE>   NASA said Congress provided $30 million for the next phase of study
and development by the Applied Physics Lab--where the spacecraft is to be
built--the Boulder institute and other agencies working on the project.
NASA said further work on the $488-million enterprise is contingent on,
among other things, continued funding from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But Stern vowed that the mission could be done successfully. "I know
we know how to do it," he said. "We've been given the keys, at least
temporarily."</TE>
<TE>   The team has a key advantage: the blessing and participation of Patsy
Tombaugh, the widow of Clyde Tombaugh, who in February 1930, at age 24,
discovered Pluto.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish you luck," she recently wrote the lab, "and look forward to a
successful partnership in this project." Clyde Tombaugh died in 1997 at
age 90.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,000-pound New Horizons spacecraft, according to the plan, would
be launched from Cape Canaveral atop a powerful rocket in January 2006
and hurtle into space at 70,000 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The first leg, dubbed "Cruise 1," would take it to Jupiter, which it
would reach in about 14 months.</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for it to study the giant gas planet and perhaps one of its
moons and then, using Jupiter's gravity as a booster, dash into "Cruise
2," the almost decade-long journey to Pluto. For much of that time, the
spacecraft, with its onboard nuclear power source, would be in
hibernation, physics lab scientists said, being awakened for only about
50 days each year until it neared Pluto.</TE>
<TE>'The Solar System's a Big Place'</TE>
<TE>   Back on Earth, the New Horizons team would stand down for much of the
time. Some may retire, or even "expire," as Mission Director Robert
Farquhar, 69, of the physics lab, jokes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be 65 when we get out there," Cheng said, "but hope to be going
strong. I don't plan to retire then. . . . It takes a long time. The
solar system's a big place."</TE>
<TE>   For Pluto, though, a decade is a trifle, a mere fraction of an orbit
so vast that the planet still has not completed the 248.5-year circuit it
began when Benjamin Franklin flew kites in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Pluto is so small and distant that it is now generally described as a
"Kuiper Belt object," associated with the huge realm of recently
discovered miniature planets or ice dwarfs that float beyond its orbit.
Pluto and its comparatively large moon, Charon, named for the figure in
classical mythology who ferried the dead over the river Styx, "are sort
of the king and queen of the Kuiper Belt," Cheng said.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts believe that Pluto no longer qualifies as a planet. About
two years ago, New York's American Museum of Natural History opened an
Earth and space center that excluded Pluto as a planet and listed a solar
system family of just eight.</TE>
<TE>   Uproar ensued.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a silly debate," Cheng said. "We call it a planet. It's always
been a planet, since it was discovered. Let's not waste time."</TE>
<TE>Atmosphere Will Vanish</TE>
<TE>   It is urgent that the spacecraft reach Pluto before its atmosphere
starts to vanish about 2020. "If we miss this atmosphere," Stern said,
for "two centuries, it's very likely that there will be no atmosphere to
study, or only the faintest remnants."</TE>
<TE>   As the spacecraft neared Pluto and Charon, it would target the two
with an array of cameras and sensors. Data and pictures should begin
pouring back months before the craft makes its closest pass, 6,000 miles
from Pluto, between 2016 and 2018.</TE>
<TE>   When that happens, Stern said, "it'll just be breathtaking. We will,
at closest approach, see objects the size of office buildings."</TE>
<TE>   On Earth, if all goes well, aging scientists may be permitted a
high-five or two, if they're still up to it.</TE>
<TE>   "For all time," Stern said, "as long as we have a thread of
civilization and history, the first exploration of Pluto and the Kuiper
Belt will always be the pioneering mission to the frontier. It's
awe-inspiring."</TE>

<HD>Robots Setting Sights on Catfish-Eating Birds</HD>
<DH>Technology: The devices, including one planned to resemble an
alligator, use water cannons to scare off feathered poachers.</DH>

<DL>BATON ROUGE, La.
</DL>
<LD>It prowls the pond, on the hunt for pelicans and cormorants. When
it's close enough, splat!</LD>
<LD>   It's a solar-powered robot scarecrow that guards catfish and crawfish
ponds with a water cannon.</LD>
<LD>   The basic model has paddlewheels and pontoons; a student is building
one to look like a big alligator.</LD>
<TE>   There are still bugs to be worked out, but developers at Louisiana
State University figure they may be able to talk to manufacturers about
their project sometime next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people have told us they tried alligator decoys," said
researcher Randy Price. "They said it worked really well for about a
month, until the birds realized it was just a decoy."</TE>
<TE>   An 8-foot-long "robogator" might keep the birds fooled, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Catfish farmers are our biggest pressure right now. They're losing a
lot of fingerlings--baby catfish," said fellow researcher Steve Hall.
"That can cost them tens of thousands of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Catfish farmers say they also spend thousands of dollars a year to
scare the diving birds with sonic cannons or to kill them with poison or
guns.</TE>
<TE>   A University of Arkansas study at a state hatchery found that, even
though cormorants showed up during only two of the study's 15 months,
they were by far the biggest predators. They ate more than a million
catfish--fingerlings worth nearly $90,000, making up nearly half the
fishery's stock.</TE>
<TE>   Hall, an aquaculture specialist, and Price, whose field is
agricultural automation, figure their solar-powered invention might sell
for $500 to $600.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like it'd be real good for each individual pond. But no way
you could afford it all around the whole farm, I would think," said Rick
Moyer, who has about 40 ponds at his aquaculture farm in Sunflower, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   But Will Branton of Leland, Miss., said it would be worth at least a
try on problem ponds. "We buy bird cannons. They cost $350, and they
don't work worth a darn," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He estimated that birds cost him $60,000 a year in losses, plus the
time and equipment needed to scare them from his 42 ponds.</TE>
<TE>   Moyer estimated that he spends thousands of dollars a year chasing
birds by car, shouting and honking; shooting guns to harass them; and
moving propane cannons from pond to pond.</TE>
<TE>   The LSU researchers' basic boat is a pair of pontoons supporting a
solar panel "roof," with a pair of paddlewheels.</TE>
<TE>   Hall and Price were thinking about a radio-controlled "scarebot" when
they got together last spring. Then they decided autonomy was the way to
go. The less time a farmer had to spend tending the gizmo, the better.</TE>
<TE>   One of their students is working on the gator. It has a moving mouth
and tail; the big hang-up is finding waterproof paint that doesn't eat
away the foam silhouette, Price said.</TE>
<TE>   There are two sorts of machinery to tell the boats where to go. One
involves sensors that prompt it to back up and turn when it hits the
shore; the other includes a camera and software to recognize color and
motion. It's quite good at finding a white shape (pelican) or black shape
(cormorant) and moving toward it.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing motion is harder. "If you get a lot of wind, and as you
get close to shore, it gets thrown off because it sees the shore moving
relative to the boat," Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   The boat usually scares away the birds before it gets close enough to
squirt them.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to just haze them a little--chase them off the ponds and push
them back into nature," Price said. "We want to do that without hurting
the birds."</TE>

<HD>Young Athletes Are Seeking Chemical Edge</HD>
<DH>Health: A growing number of such youths are turning to risky
substances to better compete, and the average age is getting younger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRA DREYFUSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>High school athletes are increasingly turning to drugs and other
chemical aids to build leaner, stronger bodies, researchers say.</LD>
<LD>   Studies find greater use of substances from legal but risky
supplements to illegal steroid drugs.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to pay attention to this in schools," said Timothy P. Condon,
associate director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. "If we see
this continuing, we've got a big problem."</LD>
<TE>   Among high school seniors, 3.7% have used steroids at some point in
their lives, according to a 2001 survey done for the Department of Health
and Human Services and funded by NIDA. In 2000, 2.5% reported steroid
use.</TE>
<TE>   The Monitoring the Future survey of drug use by 44,000 students at 424
schools across the nation also said that past-year steroid use by seniors
rose to 2.4% from 1.7% in 2000. Disapproval of steroid use decreased
among seniors from 88.8% in 2000 to 68.4% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Past-year steroid use in the two years among eighth- and 10th-graders
was fairly stable, at about 1.5% of eighth graders and more than 2% of
10th-graders, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Colleges are getting athletes who developed substance use habits in
high schools, and high schools should be more active in preventing the
habits from being formed, said Dr. Gary Green of UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Green examined data from questionnaires filled out in 2001 by 21,225
NCAA student athletes. He reported his findings at a Bethesda, Md.,
conference organized by the National Institutes of Health's Office of
Dietary Supplements and the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a
supplement industry trade group.</TE>
<TE>   About 42% of NCAA athletes who reported in 2001 that they use steroids
had said they brought the habit with them from high school, the study
said.</TE>
<TE>   The survey is done every four years. When the question was asked in
1997, 25% said they were using steroids in high school. Reported steroid
use in college was fairly stable at less than 1.5%.</TE>
<TE>   A similar pattern was found in use of the supplement ephedrine. Among
continued users, 58% said in 2001 they had used it in high school,
compared with 34% in 1997. Ephedrine is an NCAA banned substance,
although it is legal in the United States for sale in over-the-counter
preparations. Ephedrine is taken for such purposes as weight loss, but it
can lead to cardiac arrest or stroke.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times, we inherit problems at the collegiate level," Green
said. "By the time they get to the NCAA level, primary prevention is out
the window."</TE>
<TE>   HHS is encouraging high schools to adopt anti-drug campaigns for
athletes. One such program is ATLAS (Athletes Training and Learning to
Avoid Steroids), developed through a NIDA grant. The program teaches
teenage boys the dangers of drugs and the risks in some supplements, and
shows them how to teach their fellow athletes to get results without
supplements.</TE>
<TE>   A similar program, ATHENA (Athletes Targeting Healthy Exercise and
Nutrition Alternatives) focuses on girls, especially on eating disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Teens who turn to chemicals in hopes of becoming better athletes also
commonly abuse other drugs, said the programs' developer, Dr. Linn
Goldberg of Oregon Health and Science University. "Steroid use goes along
with other illicit drug use," he said.</TE>
<TE>   ATLAS and ATHENA are designed to prevent that, by having students set
examples on training and eating right, Goldberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Teens who went through the program "got stronger, had less body fat,
better nutritional practices, and a more than 50% reduction in the use of
steroids," Goldberg said.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Chef Cooks Up a Bags to Riches Story</HD>
<DH>Careers: Divorced woman uses meager assets and help of her two sons
to become the toast of the Food Network and more.</DH>

<DL>SAVANNAH, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>When Paula Deen went into the bag lunch business, she had $200 in
the bank and two sons to support. She made sandwiches, soups and salads
and then kept her fingers crossed while the boys hawked them at doctor's
offices, beauty parlors and banks.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 13 years later, the 54-year-old Deen is cooking for a much
larger extended family.</LD>
<LD>   Her downtown restaurant, Lady &amp; Sons, is packed with lunchtime crowds
who line up for the fried chicken, sweet potatoes and collard greens. Two
years ago, the restaurant won the "meal of the year" award from USA
Today, edging out restaurants in New York, Paris and Chicago.</LD>
<TE>   "The first two years I lived here, I went there at least two times a
week," said Mike Tally of Hospitality Tours and Gifts, who often refers
tourists to the Lady &amp; Sons for a taste of true Southern cooking.</TE>
<TE>   "I jokingly tell some of the customers, when you go there it's the
kind of food that'll make you go home and slap your momma," he said.
"Their mommas might not have been that good of a cook."</TE>
<TE>   Deen recently taped the first two installments of her own show for the
Food Network. A Southern cook who specializes in cheese biscuits and
banana pudding may seem out of place alongside Emeril Lagasse and
Wolfgang Puck, but Deen is betting there's a national cable audience
hungry for simple fare that recalls your grandmother's Sunday lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the feeling is people are looking for that comfort, that
feeling of being safe and having the food they grew up with," Deen said.
"Not fancy food, but food that makes you feel good."</TE>
<TE>   The show won't be Deen's first exposure beyond Savannah. She's been a
guest on the Food Network and published two cookbooks that were popular
on the QVC shopping network.</TE>
<TE>   Deen's taste of success has been simmering since 1988, when she
started the Bag Lady business from scratch. Recently divorced, all she
had was $200, cooking skills learned from her grandmother, and two sons,
Jamie and Bobby, willing to pitch in.</TE>
<TE>   Deen cooked at home, often starting at 2 a.m. on grilled chicken
salads, pimento cheese sandwiches, chopped barbecue, chicken pot pies and
twice-baked potatoes stuffed with shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   Her sons sold the food door-to-door, slowly building a loyal
clientele.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never forget the first door we knocked on and said, 'Y'all want
to buy lunch?' " said Jamie Deen, 34. "It was as hard as you can
imagine--a total cold sale every day. But after a while, folks would
expect us to come back every day."</TE>
<TE>   The Deens did well enough by 1990 to open a small restaurant in a
hotel, then moved to Savannah's historic district in 1995. Deen has
already bought a larger space nearby, where she hopes to move by 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Her national exposure happened largely by chance. A Random House
editor who wandered in for lunch decided to publish Deen's self-published
cookbook. A mutual friend introduced her to Gordon Elliott, a former
talk-show host who is producing Deen's cable show.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Deens still work at the restaurant, busing tables and
refilling tea glasses while their mother signs copies of her books. She
said she hopes the Food Network will give her a weekly show after the
first episode airs, tentatively by March.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just fun. But it's stressful," she said. "I've worked 20-hour
days in this restaurant and with physical labor, and I couldn't have been
a drop more tired than when I got done doing those cooking shows."</TE>
<TE>   Her sons said they're not banking on stardom.</TE>
<TE>   "We just wake up and work hard and these things seem to come," Jamie
Deen said. "I don't have time to sit in the living room and smoke a cigar
and say, 'Today the Food Network, tomorrow the world.' "</TE>

<HD>Enron's Lay Met With Executive on 'Improprieties,' Lawyer Says</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Sherron Watkins was said to be assured the board was
studying the matter. No findings were issued.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay held several meetings in late
October with a vice president who had urged him to clean up a series of
"improprieties," her lawyer said in an interview Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Lay first met with Sherron S. Watkins, Enron's vice president for
corporate development, for half an hour Aug. 22, shortly after she wrote
him an anonymous letter detailing her fears that the energy company would
"implode in a wave of accounting scandals." But Philip Hilder, Watkins'
lawyer, said "there were also subsequent meetings in October."</LD>
<LD>   At one of the meetings, Lay told Watkins that the Enron board had
formed a committee to look into the accounting issues, Hilder said. But
he declined to provide further details of the meetings, which have not
been previously reported.</LD>
<TE>   By October, the energy company was indeed beginning to implode. On
Oct. 16, Enron announced an unexpected charge against earnings of more
than $1 billion. On Oct. 22, the Securities and Exchange Commission began
an inquiry. On Oct. 24, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow took a
leave of absence. On Oct. 31, the board announced the formation of the
special committee, which has not yet issued any findings.</TE>
<TE>   An Enron spokeswoman said Saturday that she had no details about the
Lay-Watkins meetings in October.</TE>
<TE>   Hilder also provided a better timeline for how the 42-year-old Watkins
discovered and acted on the accounting irregularities, which involved
so-called special purpose entities, some of which were based in the
Cayman Islands, a haven for tax shelters.</TE>
<TE>   An eight-year veteran of Enron, Watkins had spent less than two months
working for Fastow when, in the course of reviewing which assets could be
sold, she "stumbled across" details on the entities, Hilder said.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers just didn't add up," Hilder said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Watkins didn't confront Fastow. "She felt he knew what was
going on and, if she confronted him with it, that would have been the end
of her at Enron," the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   When Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling resigned Aug. 14 after
only six months on the job, Watkins had her opening. Skilling's abrupt
departure for "personal reasons" stunned the company, and Lay scheduled
an Aug. 16 meeting at the Hyatt Regency here for all concerned employees.
He invited them to submit questions in advance--anonymously, if they
wished.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins wrote a one-page letter, saying, "Skilling's abrupt departure
will raise suspicions of accounting improprieties and valuation issues .
. . . I am incredibly nervous."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting with employees didn't produce the resolution Watkins
wanted, Hilder said, so her next step was to call a friend at Andersen,
Enron's accounting firm. "She went to him as a sounding board," Hilder
said. "Here she feels she is hanging out all alone. These deals must have
been looked at by the accountants, maybe the lawyers, the top company
brass. She had some doubt that maybe she had gotten it wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins ultimately sought and was granted an Aug. 22 meeting with Lay,
at which she gave him a six-page memo that detailed her questions and
talked generally about the high level of employee worry. "I wish we would
get caught," she quoted one Enron manager as saying in the memo. "We're
such a crooked company."</TE>
<TE>   Lay later asked Vinson &amp; Elkins, Enron's principal outside law firm,
to conduct the review. Watkins had urged him not to hire that firm,
saying Vinson &amp; Elkins had a conflict because they had provided opinions
on some of the deals.</TE>
<TE>   By the beginning of September, Watkins had transferred out of Fastow's
office. On Oct. 15, Vinson &amp; Elkins issued its report, which basically
gave the special partnerships a clean bill of health.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins' reaction to the report, the lawyer said, "is probably pretty
obvious, given her feelings about them looking into the matter . . . ."</TE>

<HD>Meth Lab Crackdown Dealt a Setback</HD>
<DH>Drugs: State and federal agents in Central Valley say manpower
drain has crippled their efforts as agents are transferred to the
anti-terrorism cause.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MERCED, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Before Sept. 11, state and federal agents thought they were turning
the corner in the battle against one of the biggest blights in
California's agricultural heartland: the massive, illegal production of
methamphetamine.</LD>
<LD>   A federal Drug Enforcement Administration program to restrict the
supply of the chemical agents used in making the deadly drug was showing
impressive results. A team of specialists from local drug units, the
California Highway Patrol, DEA and FBI averaged one bust a week of the
clandestine "super labs" that had made the Central Valley the national
center for the production of meth, known on the streets as "crank."</LD>
<LD>   But officials here say a post-September manpower drain threatens to
undo their efforts, as agents have been transferred to the anti-terrorism
cause. The effect on the valley drug program reflects the general
national strain on local law enforcement produced by the anti-terror
campaign.</LD>
<TE>   Although few suggest cutting back in the fight against terrorism, some
law enforcement experts contend that the battle is beginning to take a
toll.</TE>
<TE>   In the FBI alone, spokesman Thomas Hinojosa said, about 7,000 people
are now involved in the counter-terrorism effort--about one-fourth of the
bureau's work force. Many of these agents and support staff had
previously been assigned to state programs, including the federally
funded, $2.5-million Central Valley High-Intensity Drug Trafficking
project.</TE>
<TE>   "The bad guys always know where your resources are devoted," said Tom
Umberg, a former Los Angeles federal prosecutor who served for three
years in the White House drug policy office during the Clinton
administration. "We are at a critical juncture now with respect to meth
production in California. It would be a shame if we took a step backward
at this point."</TE>
<TE>   After the September attacks, said Bill Ruzzamenti, director of the
Fresno-based Central Valley project, six FBI agents assigned to his team
were transferred to the national terror probe, two federal drug agents
were shifted to federal air marshal duty and a Border Patrol agent was
given an anti-terrorism job.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the Colombia of methamphetamine manufacturing," a frustrated
Ruzzamenti said. "There are hundreds of federal agents in Colombia. Now
we [in the Central Valley] have only four."</TE>
<TE>   Nine California members of Congress signed a Jan. 7 letter to DEA
Administrator Donnie Marshall asking for help.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the FBI is understandably forced to reassign its valley
agents to anti-terrorism efforts," wrote the California delegation
members, including Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, "we strongly
believe the DEA should respond by assigning additional agents to the
Central Valley."</TE>
<TE>Raids Continue on Drug Suspects</TE>
<TE>   None of this means that the methamphetamine enforcement program has
screeched to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the DEA, U.S. Customs Service, Internal Revenue
Service and Royal Canadian Mounted Police broke up a major smuggling ring
for pseudoephedrine, the main chemical precursor used to make
methamphetamine. They arrested 100 people, including suspects in the
Central Valley and the Inland Empire alleged to be part of a major
smuggling network.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Central Valley investigators raided a methamphetamine
super-lab on the outskirts of Merced. After observing three men working
with "drug-cooking" materials in a shed behind a small farmhouse, the
agents moved in when the men got into two cars and headed into the city,
where they were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Sheriff's Department drug agents and CHP officers assigned
to the high-intensity drug unit raided the farmhouse, where they found
vats of chemicals, including 10 pounds of red phosphorus used in
producing meth, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   While the men, all Mexican citizens, were engaged in the potentially
explosive process of extracting pure methamphetamine from a large supply
of illegally imported pseudoephedrine, four small children watched
television inside the three-room farmhouse. The children were taken to a
local hospital by county child protection services staff to be tested for
possible methamphetamine contamination.</TE>
<TE>   Under the mattress in the bedroom, investigators said, they found
three weapons, including an illegal semiautomatic rifle.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno County Sheriff's Sgt. Rick Hill estimated that the lab was
capable of producing 40 pounds of meth, with a street value of more than
$300,000.</TE>
<TE>   The DEA estimates that California is the source of 80% to 90% of the
nation's methamphetamine. Originally, production was the domain of biker
groups, notably the California Hells Angels, which at one time operated
what amounted to a meth cartel.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, however, the operation shifted to Mexican networks that
easily blended into the Central Valley's farm labor population and Latino
communities in the Inland Empire. The nexus of major highways in both
places facilitated distribution to markets across the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, the state and federal agents believed that they were
on the verge of driving meth production out of the valley. Now they are
not so sure.</TE>
<TE>   "While I understand the new focus on terrorism," said Rep. Cal Dooley
(D-Fresno), one of congressmen concerned by the staff cutbacks, "the DEA
should step up to the plate to make sure our gains in the meth fight
aren't erased."</TE>
<TE>   At stake is a panoply of social and environmental ills.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ruzzamenti, every pound of methamphetamine produces 10
pounds of toxic waste, most of which is dumped in ecologically sensitive
areas. A private contractor hired to clean up meth-related hazardous dump
sites responded to more than 500 calls last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We found one dump site on the banks of the California Aqueduct," Hill
said. "That's water that goes to L.A."</TE>
<TE>   John Maddox, who runs a big dairy near Merced and farms 7,000 acres of
cotton, corn, sugar beets and alfalfa, had a scare a few days ago when he
found two canisters of deadly hydrogen chloride gas, presumably dumped by
drug makers, in a ditch next to one of his fields.</TE>
<TE>   "Used to be the most we'd find was a burned-out car," he said with a
sigh.</TE>
<TE>   There also has been a heavy cost to Central Valley cities, where
inexpensive, readily available meth has become the drug of choice and
principal cause of crime among young people.</TE>
<TE>Destructive World of Meth Addiction</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl West, 34, said she was already troubled when she moved to
Fresno from Washington state six years ago. She had tried
methamphetamine, but did not become an addict until she came to Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   After a year, she was using an "eight ball" a day--about $100 worth of
meth. To support her habit, West, a skilled computer operator,
counterfeited bank checks and California driver's licenses, which she
would sometimes exchange for drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Not sleeping for days at a time, West would find herself in all-night
stores populated by other addicts there to shoplift goods or plan other
criminal activities to raise money.</TE>
<TE>   After serving time in county jail for fraud, she now has a job as a
legal aide.</TE>
<TE>   In the destructive world of meth addiction, said CHP drug agent Erik
Skidmore, West is one of the few users with a chance to make it out.</TE>
<TE>   "I've made 5,000 drug arrests in 22 years," he said. "I can only think
of three or four who were able to turn their lives around."</TE>

<HD>State May Be Re-Energized, but Powerful Questions Remain</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's remarkable to recall, one year later, how bleak it all seemed
at the time. In the third week of January 2001, after months of worrisome
forecasts, the energy crisis finally appeared to crash down upon
California.</LD>
<LD>   Northern California was hit with back-to-back rounds of rolling
blackouts, creating chaos at unlighted intersections, trapping people in
elevators, making battery vendors rich.</LD>
<LD>   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, staggered
by ever-rising wholesale electricity prices, disclosed in federal filings
that they could no longer make payments for power purchases.</LD>
<TE>   Looking at a projected 14,000-megawatt shortage for the next day, Gov.
Gray Davis, pale as a frosted lightbulb, summoned reporters to a
late-night news conference and announced:</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight I am declaring a state of emergency in California. I am
calling on the Legislature . . . to give the state the authority and the
resources to keep the lights on."</TE>
<TE>   This emergency declaration was made in a Capitol that had been rammed
the night before by a suicidal big-rig trucker, adding to the surreal
atmosphere. California seemed more than ever an island on the
land--albeit one surrounded by sharks.</TE>
<TE>   A newly elected president, not yet installed in the White House, was
sending out signals that, in this fix, California would be on its own.
The Wall Street Journal clucked on its editorial page: "The comedy is
almost too broad to bear. In the past month, the country's showcase state
has come to look like a hapless banana republic."</TE>
<TE>   Enron offered to assist California, if the price was right.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, of course, much has changed.</TE>
<TE>   California is up and running, fully lighted; after a frantic drive for
more generation capacity, would-be plant builders are now reluctant to
pursue their construction plans, fearing low prices and oversupply. At
least this time around they will acknowledge their hesitancy to build is
grounded in economics, as it always has been, and is not a byproduct of
excessive red tape or tree-hugging environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity conservation, which a year ago, according to private polls
done for the governor, showed little promise of success, not only
flourished during the crisis but has continued at a near double-digit
pace. If nothing else, Californians in a single year have weaned
themselves off the notion that a second fridge is a vital component of
the good life.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush eventually went ahead and appointed a federal energy
regulator who actually seems to believe in federal energy regulation--no
small breakthrough. And the energy mess no longer is of much interest to
the national media . . . or even the California media, for that matter.
The headlines now are all about Enron, then a champion of the drive to
deregulate electricity, now a toppled monument to hubris, greed and
"aggressive" accounting.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember the energy crisis?" consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield felt
compelled to ask last Thursday at the outset of a teleconference. The
point of the conference was to release a report by the Santa Monica-based
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. The title of the report was
"Hoax," neatly summarizing the contention of Rosenfield and Co. that the
energy fiasco was manufactured from the get-go, a ploy to hold back
supply and jack up prices.</TE>
<TE>   And certainly there is evidence to suggest that Californians were
ambushed--lots of smoke on that grassy knoll known as the spot market. A
case also can be made that the state set itself up for a fall, designing
a deregulation program that was tantamount to leaving the lights on and
the doors unlocked, all but inviting the energy bandits to back up their
trucks and load up.</TE>
<TE>   All of this, of course, has been kicked around thoroughly in the past
12 months, and to no great end. For whatever reasons, the crisis came and
the crisis went. Presumably the villains and heroes will be sorted out in
due time. This is not to say, however, that the matter is closed. A year
later, even as the plants and power lines thrum, fundamental questions
wait to be addressed:</TE>
<TE>   If the old-style regulation was flawed, and deregulation has failed,
then what now? What is the energy model for California's long-term
future: public, private, co-op, competitive? Is electricity something
Californians want to subject to the boom-and-bust cycles of the market?
Is the power grid best left to the government, as a sort of DMV for
electrons? Or is there some other way? Without a backdrop of rolling
blackouts and flaming big rigs, such questions no longer seem quite so
exciting, I know. Still, one year and several hundred headlines later,
they remain.</TE>

<HD>Nun Strives to Save a Small Girls' School That Has a Big Impact</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In four decades as a Roman Catholic nun, Sister Fay Hagen has
embraced many challenges, whether cooking spaghetti dinners for 140 on a
one-burner stove or persuading a public school district to provide
classes for the children of homeless families.</LD>
<LD>   Now she is caught up in a different kind of challenge: ensuring the
survival of St. Mary's Academy in Inglewood, a 113-year-old college prep
high school that serves girls from mostly minority, low- and
moderate-income families.</LD>
<LD>   And, 18 months into her tenure as principal, there are promising signs
that the school can succeed in its battle against low enrollments and
tight money, problems that have closed many other urban Catholic schools
across the country over the last couple of decades.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to get the message out that we have a fine school here. We
have the best and the brightest, but we're the best-kept secret in
Inglewood!" said Sister Fay.</TE>
<TE>   Founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, St. Mary's used to
be the school of choice for the daughters of the area's white,
middle-class Catholic families. Now it has come to mirror the demographic
changes that have transformed Los Angeles in recent decades. Today,
African Americans make up about 66% of the student body, with Latinas
accounting for 33%; more than half the students are not Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   To an outsider, St. Mary's would seem not at all in need of rescue. It
has a spacious, sparkling campus, with a large library, gymnasium,
college counseling center, art rooms, and computer and science labs. At
least 95% of each class of graduating "Belles" enters college, with some
accepted to such institutions as Yale, Stanford and UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   But, like other private schools with large numbers of families hard
pressed to afford even modest tuitions, St. Mary's has had worries.
Almost half its families receive help with the $4,200 annual tuition.
There is a $347,000 gap this year between revenues and operating
expenses, which the school expects to close with help from foundations,
alumnae and the Sisters of St. Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   School officials also want to build the academy's roughly $500,000
endowment fund to between $1 million and $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   When St. Mary's moved to its present campus in 1966, enrollment was
825 in grades nine through 12. School leaders have since settled on 500
as the optimum.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the school's reputation for excellence, enrollment slid in
recent years, reaching a low of 283 in 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a concern we all had that we might not make it," said Paul
Eckles, president of the school's Board of Trustees and a former longtime
city administrator for Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   When the principal's post became vacant early in 2000, Eckles
recalled, the board and the Sisters of St. Joseph found themselves at a
crossroads as they began a search for a new school leader. "We resolved
that we were going to make a special effort to turn things around," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, though it is "certainly too soon to declare victory, we clearly
are moving in the right direction," Eckles said, adding that, in choosing
Sister Fay, "our experience has shown us we made one good decision."</TE>
<TE>   Among the positive signs under her leadership is an enrollment rise in
2001-02 to 314, a significant turnaround but still shy of the 400-plus
that school officials figure they need to pay the bills. The number of
entering freshmen increased 26% and, as the Jan. 28 deadline for student
applications nears, officials are hopeful for a big response for next
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Fay, 65, moved into the principal's office, and the convent
adjoining the academy, in July 2000. Raised in San Diego, she had spent
most of her adult life there working in Catholic ministries and serving
as an administrator in Catholic schools.</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't take her long to settle into her new community--or to
embark with her board on a strategy that includes boosting fund-raising,
improving student recruitment and raising the school's profile in
Inglewood--home to about a quarter of its students--and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   An energetic, outgoing woman, she started attending chamber of
commerce mixers and meeting with civic leaders. She wrote articles for
the community monthly Inglewood Today and joined Mayor Roosevelt Dorn's
advisory committee of local religious leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The school, in a two-story building across the street from Daniel
Freeman Memorial Hospital, provides personal counselors--at no charge to
families--five days a week; a full complement of clubs and other
activities; and tutoring by its teachers. It fields teams in eight sports
and involves its students in community service programs. It counts 13
nuns among its full- and part-time staff of about 45 and has full
accreditation from the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Some of its faculty members are St. Mary's graduates or have taught
there for years, providing continuity and stability at what the sisters
believe to be the oldest continuously operating Catholic high school in
the Los Angeles Archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   It began as a boarding school at 21st Street and Grand Avenue in
South-Central Los Angeles before moving to Crenshaw Boulevard and Slauson
Avenue in 1904, a site it occupied until building its current campus in
the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "What St. Mary's does for this community is amazing; it is what
opportunity is all about," said Tom Bowling, vice president and general
manager of the nearby Hollywood Park Casino.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the St. Mary's board three years ago, attracted by the
school's success in providing a "prep school type" education, and a range
of other support, for students who might otherwise face long odds in
life. "It's a tremendous asset to guide them into womanhood," Bowling
said.</TE>
<TE>   Urban Catholic schools historically have provided successful
alternatives for disadvantaged groups, especially for recent immigrants
and minorities, said John B. Orr, director of special projects at USC's
Center for Religion and Civic Culture.</TE>
<TE>   "They attract an enormous amount of respect among educators, but they
often do face threatening financial base problems," Orr said.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, many Catholic schools in urban neighborhoods
struggled through the 1980s and 1990s as their base of white
working-class families has moved to suburbs, where Catholic schools are
thriving, according to the National Catholic Educational Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles region, several schools serving primarily
low-income minority communities have closed or merged with others in
recent years, despite subsidies from the archdiocese and its educational
foundation, which has awarded about $6 million in tuition grants since
its founding in 1986. Education officials estimate that there are more
than 3,000 empty seats at 11 Catholic high schools in the Los Angeles
area.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood Mayor Dorn counts himself a strong admirer of the school and
its principal.</TE>
<TE>   "The school has been a standout for many years, and I would certainly
hate to see it close," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think she has the right approach, and is the right person, to
turn things around," Dorn added, citing Sister Fay's "obviously high
intelligence," her candor and "warm and disarming" personality.</TE>
<TE>   Father Joe Carroll, with whom Sister Fay worked for much of the 1980s
when his St. Vincent DePaul programs were getting off the ground in San
Diego, said she "doesn't understand when people say something can't be
done."</TE>
<TE>   Her sometimes unorthodox approach enabled her to establish one of the
church's first programs for AIDS sufferers, put together a women's
auxiliary of volunteers and fund-raisers for that and other ministries,
and prompt the San Diego Unified School District to establish a program
at the charity's shelter for homeless families.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a tough sergeant type, not what you'd expect a wonderful little
nun to be like. Once she takes on a job, then get out of her way and
she'll get it done," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   The school's alumnae, whose roster includes attorneys and judges,
business executives and civic leaders, got a taste of Sister's Fay's
directness in a letter she sent them soon after her arrival.</TE>
<TE>   The envelope, alluding to the school's possible fates, bore three
boxes, labeled "Close," "Coed" and "Other." The letter inside began, "I
hope you checked 'Other' " and laid out the school's circumstances in no
uncertain terms.</TE>
<TE>   The mailing brought in about $100,000 to help the school keep up its
tradition of "Empowering Young Women." Tucked in with many checks were
affectionate notes from alumnae who identified themselves by the color of
their class ties, a tradition that dates to the 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   Danyel Smith, Red Tie Class of 1983 and an editor at Time Inc. in New
York, whose first novel is to be published next year, sent $1,000 in
honor of two of her English teachers: Linda Walsh, now the school's
college counselor, and Rose Larson, now assistant principal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great place to go to school. The teachers really care about
you. They help you to believe in yourself and do your best and be your
best, and to care about others," said Smith, who has joined the school's
Development Council, recently formed to increase fund-raising. "As I've
gotten older, I've appreciated it more."</TE>
<TE>   Sister Fay also moved to strengthen the academic program. For example,
she added calculus to the curriculum this school year, an investment she
considers worth making even though only two students are enrolled in the
course.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to start someplace, and if it's going to inspire others,
then it's worth it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As with enrollment, fund-raising is up, thanks in part to appeals to
alumnae and an annual "Derby Day" established last year by Hollywood Park
Casino, which netted almost $15,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's wonderful to be reminded that we are not in this alone," Sister
Fay said.</TE>
<TE>   Leading a visitor on a campus tour, the principal stops often to chat
with students and faculty: "It's nice to be able to show them all off."</TE>
<TE>   She calls out encouragements and compliments in a deep, booming voice.
Then, rounding a corner, Sister Fay spots a scattering of Post-Its on an
otherwise pristine hallway floor. "Oooh, Oooooh! What happened here?" She
is smiling, but the two students standing nearby get the point. They
scramble to remove the offending scraps.</TE>
<TE>   In a room down the hall, Gold Ties (seniors) Marcela Martinez and
Kimberly Morris are working on the yearbook and explaining what they like
about St. Mary's. Their list includes knowing they are prepared for
college, having only girls as classmates ("You can be yourself here,"
says Kimberly) and studying religion.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though it's a Catholic school, we get to learn about all
different religions, and I think that makes us more open-minded," says
Marcela.</TE>
<TE>   "I like that it's a small school, and our teachers really know us,"
Kimberly adds. "They work us hard, but that's because they care."</TE>

<HD>Ojai Potter Finds a Formula for Wealth</HD>
<DH>Culture: Otto Heino spent 10 years creating a long-lost yellow
Chinese glaze cherished by artists. And, at 86, he's not telling how he
did it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Otto Heino set out to find the long lost formula for an
ancient yellow Chinese glaze, he was already a brilliant potter. When he
rediscovered it five years ago, he became a rich one as well.</LD>
<LD>   Flush with cash, the 86-year-old Ojai artist has indulged himself with
a silver Rolls Royce and a shiny black Bentley that he only drives on
Sundays. He has donated $400,000 to the International Museum of Ceramic
Art in New York. And he has pledged $300,000 to the Ventura County Museum
of History and Art for a new gallery.</LD>
<LD>   His ceramic bottles, listed as high as $25,000 each on the Internet,
have been acquired by collectors from Kennebunkport, Maine, to Tokyo to
the king of Mustang, a remote region of Nepal bordering Tibet.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the formula for the buttery glaze remains locked away in
Heino's brain. He destroys all evidence of his ingredients. The plastic
bags they come in go straight into the fireplace. And he keeps a wary eye
out for rival potters snooping around his shop.</TE>
<TE>   "The answer is right under their nose," says the hearty New Englander
with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   But when asked for a glimpse of the stuff, Heino stops laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "No, nobody gets to see it," he says firmly.</TE>
<TE>   Val Cushing, a professor emeritus of pottery and glazes at the New
York College of Ceramics at Alfred University, the world's only institute
of ceramic art, said the yellow glaze was popular during China's Chin
Dynasty from AD 265 to 420. But like many other glazes, it was lost over
time.</TE>
<TE>   "Glazes were very significant in Chinese culture," he said. "The
Chinese invented high fired ceramics and porcelain."</TE>
<TE>   But it was the Japanese who kept ceramics alive through the centuries
and who still pay handsomely for them. Pottery is the highest art form in
Japan, and those who excel are deemed "national treasures," Cushing said.
"Those with that designation can sell small tea bowls for $200,000. And
Otto is seen as that kind of artist. When it comes to the amount of money
he makes, he's a real phenomenon."</TE>
<TE>A Decade Spent Tinkering in Garage</TE>
<TE>   Heino first heard of the glaze in 1985 while attending a world
ceramics conference in Shigaraki, Japan, with his wife and fellow potter,
Vivika. They were told the formula for a yellow glaze produced at high
temperatures in China had been lost for centuries. The potters were
challenged to find it.</TE>
<TE>   Heino and his wife spent a decade in their garage trying to decipher
the precise formula.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was at high temperatures, the glazes lost their luster.
High fired ceramics are stronger than those fired at lower temperatures.
Then, in 1995, just a few months after Vivika died, Heino found the
yellow and struck gold.</TE>
<TE>   His luck had turned after analyzing the iron oxide he was using. It
was only 60% pure. He went to Spain and found iron oxide that was 99%
pure.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I traveled all over the world gathering materials and talking to
geologists," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After much trial and error, he found a substance that, at 2,400
degrees, left a rich yellow color behind. He snapped up 25 pounds of it
for $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   Other potters credit Heino for his glaze but feel he might be
overstating his achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no new or secret glazes, really," said Susan Peterson, a
retired ceramics professor from USC who has written 11 books on ceramics
and taught the subject around the world for 55 years. "But you can
rediscover them."</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Bacerra, who chaired the ceramics departments at the former
Chouinard Art Institute and Otis College of Art and Design, said Heino's
real feat was getting a yellow glaze at such high temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually it burns out, but he has discovered a way to do it. It has a
lot of depth to it," Bacerra said. "It's not so special to me but to the
Asians it's the color similar to Buddhist and Shinto monks' robes."</TE>
<TE>   Bacerra said many noted potters fetch high prices for their work. He
has sold pots for $60,000 and said he knows others who sell for more than
$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Cushing, who wrote a book on glazes, said duplicating Heino's glaze
would be difficult but not impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "The Japanese have a tomato red glaze, based on a combination of a red
clay and feldspar," Cushing said. "This particular red clay is in a
particular valley and in a particular stream in Japan. So it's very
plausible that Otto has found a mineral that would correspond closely to
this."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Schiffer, executive director of the Ventura County Museum of
History and Art, is writing a book about Heino and his art. Heino's
donation to the museum will fund a wing with a rotating exhibit including
some of his and Vivika's pottery.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad there is no one who is apprenticing to him," Schiffer
said. "The way he throws is just astonishing. Ceramics is so unforgiving
and so complex. If he were living in Japan he would be a living
treasure."</TE>
<TE>1,100 Things That Can Go Wrong</TE>
<TE>   Aho Heino grew up in a family of 12 children in East Hampton, Conn.
His father was a Finnish immigrant who operated a dairy and tobacco farm.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Heino was a gunner on a B-17 bomber based at an
airfield in England. It was then that he changed his name from Aho to
Otto, on the theory that the German underground would be more inclined to
help him if his name sounded familiar. It worked: He was shot down twice
and rescued twice.</TE>
<TE>   Heino became interested in pottery after watching celebrated British
potter Bernard Leach make cups and mugs.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Heino and his wife set up shop in Hopkinton, N.H.,
until Vivika was hired as a ceramics teacher at USC and the Chouinard Art
Institute, which later became the California Institute for the Arts. They
moved to Ojai in 1969, buying the home of their friend and famed potter
Beatrice Wood.</TE>
<TE>   In 1955, Heino was honored by the International Academy of Ceramics in
Cannes. And in 1978, he won the gold medal from the International de
Ceramique at Vallauris, France. He and his wife's work have been
exhibited at the Smithsonian, the Picasso Museum in France, the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   "A ceramic engineer will tell you there are 1,100 things that can go
wrong in a ceramic piece," said Peterson, who now lives in Arizona. "Otto
is managing an enormous amount of variables and he is one of the most
skilled people in the world at what he's doing."</TE>
<TE>   One of his repeat customers is Mary Woodman of Kennebunkport, who
bought a yellow pot from him for what she said was "between $5,000 and
$8,000."</TE>
<TE>   "The yellow is the hardest glaze to make and I like the buttery
color," said Woodman, an avid pottery collector.</TE>
<TE>   George Wilson, who has known Heino since 1965, once presented one of
the yellow bottles to the king of Mustang.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, 64, is president of Newspapers of New England, a company that
owns four papers including the Concord Monitor in New Hampshire. He and
his wife were visiting a neurosurgeon in Nepal who took them on a rugged
hike to Mustang. He had asked Heino earlier for a yellow glazed bottle to
give as a gift to the king.</TE>
<TE>   "I presented it to the king and said this is something the Chinese
lost and haven't been able to replicate," recalled Wilson. "He kept
looking at it and feeling it and smiling. He knew it was something very
special."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson has Heino's pottery all over his house but won't discuss how
much he has paid for it.</TE>
<TE>   "He is almost mystical about where his originality comes from," Wilson
said. "He will tell you it's not something he is doing but something in
the clay."</TE>
<TE>   Friends say Heino is a gifted raconteur who enjoys telling and
retelling stories of his past.</TE>
<TE>   But his craftsmanship speaks for itself.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a baseball cap and a dirty apron, he drops a large square of
gray clay on a spinning potter's wheel. He works the clay into the shape
of a cylinder three or four times.</TE>
<TE>   "Clay is the earth; it's alive," he said. "It's the only live material
artists can work with. I let it decide what it will be."</TE>
<TE>   Heino uses his thumb to etch lines on the piece. At the top he adds
his trademark double lip.</TE>
<TE>   "I go through 20 tons of clay a year," he said. "I don't sell at any
other gallery but here. I make it all myself. The people who buy it want
it handmade by me. It adds to the value."</TE>
<TE>   He makes his own glazes--he recently developed an eggplant-colored
one--and adjusts kiln temperatures for the color.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from pottery, cars are Heino's passion. He buys and restores
them, and "Road and Track" magazines litter his workshop.</TE>
<TE>   His walls are festooned with photos of Vivika with himself. Friends
say the two were inseparable. The names Otto and Vivika are still often
uttered in the same breath.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish she hadn't died before we started making money," Heino said
absently, setting out a pot to dry. "But the money hasn't had any real
effect on me. You can't take it with you, you know."</TE>

<DH>Law: Federal prosecutor makes the environment a priority, targeting
everyone from polluters to mountain bikers.</DH>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>After years of ignoring people caught damaging the environment in
Northern California, federal prosecutors are cracking down on tree
poachers, salmon snatchers, illegal trail cutters, oil dumpers and other
polluters.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco, responsible for enforcing
federal law from the once-pristine redwood forests at the Oregon border
to the protected waters of Monterey Bay, has gone from being the worst in
the country for prosecuting environmental crimes to one of the best.</LD>
<LD>   "There were some people who assumed that paying fines was part of the
cost of doing business," said Mike Gonzales, special agent in charge of
the National Marine Fisheries Service law enforcement office in Long
Beach. "But those same people don't want to go to jail."</LD>
<TE>   Since 1998, the office has steadily increased its environmental
criminal caseload, filing more than three dozen last year, according to
the records obtained by Syracuse University's Transactional Records
Access Clearinghouse.</TE>
<TE>   That's a substantial increase from 1986 through 1997, when only four
cases were filed in a region renowned for its gorgeous
environment--ancient redwood trees, glacier-carved lakes, fern-lined
trails, granite mountains and a rugged, sweeping coastline. Those
resources coexist with major logging, fishing, recreational and shipping
industries.</TE>
<TE>   At times the two clash, but for more than a decade, there was minimal
federal action taken against violators. That changed three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The prosecution of environmental criminal cases has been a priority
for this office since 1998 and will continue as long as I am the U.S.
attorney," said David Shapiro in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The result, say federal pollution police, is a cleaner, safer
environment.</TE>
<TE>   Cases brought by the Coast Guard against shipping companies last year
are a case in point. One company was caught illegally transporting
hazardous materials, another convicted of operating its ship with oil
leaking into the ballast tanks, causing a serious risk of explosion, and
a third firm pleaded guilty to six felonies and paid $3 million in fines
after it was caught leaking oil and lying about it.</TE>
<TE>   The new commitment also has resulted in tough punishments for some
Northern California residents.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen and hunters have been sent to federal prison for trying to
mislead authorities about their catch. Manufacturers have been forced to
restore wetlands after trying to build over them.</TE>
<TE>   And in September, Robert Bonner of Livermore was sentenced to three
years' probation and a $100,000 fine for allowing his metal-finishing
company to violate the Clean Water Act by discharging contaminated waste
water into the sewer. By November the company had filed for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   In August, three mountain bikers--Michael More, 47, of San Rafael,
William McBride, 50, of Ross, and Neal Daskal, 46, of Oakland--were
sentenced to three years' probation, a $34,000 fine and hundreds of hours
of community service for cutting an illegal trail through the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area in Marin County.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the charges were extremely trumped up," said Marty Beckins,
board member of the Marin Bicycle Trails Council. "Nobody has ever been
tried for this before, and they were facing federal felony charges. I
think the prosecutors must have been pressured by zealots."</TE>
<TE>   Carol Yeston, district ranger for the Point Reyes National Seashore,
said she brought the case to federal prosecutors but wasn't at all sure
they would take it.</TE>
<TE>   "They have priorities," she said. "Drug dealers, Mafia, all sorts of
stuff. So I was pretty excited when they took this so willingly."</TE>
<TE>   Just one of these cases goes a long way in deterring other would-be
scofflaws, said Bill Curtiss, program director for Earthjustice, a San
Francisco-based environmental law firm.</TE>
<TE>   "When there was no criminal prosecutions, before 1998, there was a
real vacuum in what would be consequences for destructive actions," he
said. "Now the Justice Department is sending a signal that individuals
are going to be subject to the process and treated as criminals."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement agents at the Environmental Protection Agency, the
FBI, the Coast Guard and other government entities routinely bring
evidence of crimes to the U.S. attorney's office. Environmental groups
from the mainstream Sierra Club to the militant Earth First! also clamor
to put polluters behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors took one out of every four cases brought to them
last year in Northern California, a huge increase from past years when
more than 95% of cases--including companies dumping sewage in San
Francisco Bay, pulp mills dumping waste into the Pacific and nuclear
power plants cooking their books--were turned away.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, California's other three U.S. attorneys--in Sacramento,
Los Angeles and San Diego--together filed 39 environmental criminal cases
last year, and turned away 45 others brought to them by law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The impetus to change in Northern California came in 1998, when Robert
Mueller, who now heads the FBI, replaced then-U.S. Atty. Michael
Yamaguchi. At the time, Associated Press published a widely used story
describing the lack of environmental prosecutions in Northern California.
Mueller didn't dispute the data, but promised to improve.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller told the AP then that one of his top priorities was to begin
enforcing federal environmental crime laws. He brought in an
environmental prosecutor and hired several other prosecutors with EPA and
environmental-law experience for his white-collar crime team. He also
told law enforcement agencies that his office would be more receptive.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Mueller had doubled the number of criminal cases
filed. The civil division, went from collecting just under $7 million in
damages in 1998 to $208 million in 2000, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro, Mueller's criminal chief before taking his place in
September, said he's committed to continuing to take on environmental
cases, despite pressures from all directions.</TE>
<TE>   "While I am the U.S. attorney, environmental criminal cases will
remain an important priority," he said. "Obviously, the office now has a
very significant responsibility to devote resources to terrorism
investigations and to continue our active prosecution of violent
criminals and firearms violators.</TE>
<TE>   "The white-collar part of our portfolio--including environmental
cases--will also continue unabated."</TE>

<HD>Volunteer Divers Retrieve Closure</HD>
<DH>Rescue: The team's deep-water recovery missions bring a measure of
comfort to grieving survivors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They come as a team from jobs as disparate as engineers or elevator
technicians to wherever the disaster may be, hoping to pull closure for
despondent families from the deep water.</LD>
<LD>   The specialty divers have no official name, pay for their training and
equipment, and earn no money for their efforts, whether they are finding
bodies, black boxes or murder weapons in water so deep that even seasoned
county rescue divers cannot reach them.</LD>
<LD>   Eight deep-water divers, trained under the Florida-based Global
Underwater Explorer program, helped last week in the effort to recover
the bodies of three men who died when their boat crashed Jan. 11 in
Castaic Lake. With the help of remote-controlled sonar equipment, they
found the three bodies, two of which they brought to the surface Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Saturday afternoon, the body of Nelson Roy Brinkman, 30, of Phelan,
was pulled from the lake after divers using sonar equipment located the
body. The bodies of Charles Wiseman, 47, of Castaic, and Steve Coulombe,
38, of Agua Dulce, were recovered Friday. Los Angeles County lifeguards
found the fourth victim, Ken Lane, 41, of La Canada Flintridge, floating
in the water immediately after the crash.</TE>
<TE>   The four men--all avid speedboat enthusiasts--allegedly were testing a
new high-performance boat manufactured by Coulombe's company, High Torque
Marine, when the twin-hulled craft flipped and sank. Witnesses told
authorities the boat was traveling at about 80 mph at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Lane and Brinkman worked as engine builders for Coulombe. Wiseman, a
concrete subcontractor, was a customer and friend.</TE>
<TE>   The boat's wreckage and the bodies were located 247 feet below the
surface--nearly 100 feet beyond the limit county divers are trained to
go.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 divers in California are trained to participate in such
deep-water recovery efforts, led for eight years by Beverly Hills
accountant Michael Kane.</TE>
<TE>   "Closure is the driving force," Kane, 39, said. "People exploit
tragedy all the time, but we do this for love of the sport."</TE>
<TE>   High-profile missions such as airplane crashes cause the most
pressure, the divers say, but the most gratifying are those in which they
help people like Amy Comtee through the grieving process.</TE>
<TE>   Comtee's 62-year-old father, Wayne Derx, was missing for 15 days after
disappearing last Sept. 2 while diving off Catalina Island.</TE>
<TE>   Kane contacted Comtee after the Tempe, Ariz., woman posted a message
on an Internet bulletin board asking the dive community for help in
finding her father's body. His team found her father on the first day of
its search.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone dies, it's not just the need for closure, it's needing
to know where they are," Comtee said. "I was so incredibly touched that
someone would risk so much just to bring us some comfort."</TE>
<TE>   The team's rigorous training prepares them for cave exploration and
deep-water diving and helps reduce some of the risks. Those risks include
the possibility of paralysis or death due to accumulated dissolved gases
bubbling in the body if a diver surfaces too quickly from water deeper
than 100 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "With every rescue and recovery that you go on, you're going into an
environment that's already killed someone else," said Mark Lonsdale, a
member of Kane's team and a training officer for the county divers. "In
deep-water diving, there's no room for error."</TE>
<TE>   County divers, about half of whom are volunteers, are trained to go
only as deep as 150 feet because it is too expensive to maintain the
capability for the rare deep recoveries, Lonsdale said. To maintain their
deep-water certification, divers must perform hundreds of deep-water
dives on a regular basis. Kane and each of his volunteers spend about
$50,000 a year on equipment, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Diving is a very, very tiny part of what sheriff's [rescue teams] are
required to do in the big picture," said Lonsdale, 46, of Santa Monica.
"The best option is to use guys who train to that level because they want
to."</TE>
<TE>   Kane said it took a while for county rescue officials to gain
confidence in his deep-diving team. When he first offered the group's
services, he said, officials were reluctant to work with them, instead
referring them to families in need.</TE>
<TE>   Within a couple of years, though, he said his team was invited by law
enforcement officials to help with missions ranging from finding guns
discarded in the ocean to retrieving the black boxes from fallen
airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's Castaic Lake recovery was the first time in Lonsdale's 13
years with the Sheriff's Department in which divers went to that depth,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The deep-water divers who participate in recovery efforts place
themselves in the sport's upper tier, Global Underwater Explorer
President Jarrod Jablonski said. Kane requires that his team members--all
volunteers who pay for their own equipment and training--undertake
hundreds of dives deeper than 200 feet before being allowed to help with
recoveries.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the act of looking for a dead body adds stress to an already
stressful environment," Jablonski said. "Only a reckless person would try
this without hours and hours of specialized training."</TE>
<TE>   Like Kane, dubbed "Mr. Showtime" by the group, the divers all have
engaging personalities. Kane exuded confidence last week at Castaic Lake
as he prepared for the dive, lugging 120-pound double tanks and swim
fins.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to having Type A personalities, the divers all revel in
risky behavior and think clearly under pressure, Kane said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have that gene in you to jump down to 400 feet to locate
a dead body," Kane said. "But you can't be the type to panic when you see
it."</TE>
<TE>   Separating emotion from the task at hand is the most difficult part of
a mission, said John Walker, a UC Irvine elevator technician who has
helped Kane.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to look at the bodies not as human beings but as targets,
like, 'Yeah, we found it,' " said Walker, 40, of Westminster. "We want to
help with the closure, but we have to be more clinical than emotional."</TE>
<TE>   Most team members live in Los Angeles and Orange counties, although
some are as far away as Monterey and San Diego. About one of every 10
seriously interested divers are chosen for the group.</TE>
<TE>   "Your team is only as strong as the weakest link," Kane said. "If you
have a cowboy or a solo player, he puts the whole team in jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   Although the divers use $200 worth of gases for each dive and take
time away from work, they refuse payment for their services.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of payment, families are asked to make donations to Catalina
Island's hyperbaric chamber, which treats injured divers.</TE>

<HD>Pasadena Superintendent Wants to Phase Out Busing</HD>
<DH>Education: Three decades after desegregation order, school board to
consider a five-year plan to redraw attendance zones to create
neighborhood schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 30 years after Pasadena schools began busing students to
comply with a federal desegregation order, the new superintendent has
designed a plan to eliminate what he calls busing's "dated structure" in
the troubled district.</LD>
<LD>   Declaring his intention to end busing over the next five years, Supt.
Percy Clark Jr. has been working to redraw the district's school
attendance zones, a vestige of 1970s integration efforts.</LD>
<LD>   "We are busing students without any intended consequence," he said.
The 23,500-student district is 85% nonwhite, yet 2,300 students are bused
to schools outside their neighborhoods.</LD>
<TE>   "At one time, [busing] was centered around desegregation--that if we
would bring black and white youngsters together, something would happen
educationally. And that hasn't happened," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, the Pasadena Board of Education will vote on the "Creating
Quality Schools Initiative," which includes redistricting--the redrawing
of school attendance zones to create neighborhood schools.</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for reopening closed campuses, changing grade
configurations at some schools and creating more magnet programs. There
also are plans to build another elementary school in the district's
northwest area, where half of the student population is concentrated.</TE>
<TE>   But for some in the community, the proposal raises fears that an end
to busing will bring the return of a racially segregated district.</TE>
<TE>   "It basically means that the conservatives have won the battle to keep
black kids and white kids from going to the same school," said Joe
Hopkins, publisher of the black newspaper Pasadena Journal.</TE>
<TE>   "We already tried neighborhood schools. It was called segregation,"
said Maurice Morse, a 39-year veteran of the district who was called as a
witness in the 1969 desegregation case that brought busing to the city's
schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Morse taught in one of the district's first integrated classrooms. But
as hard as she fought for integration, she now reluctantly admits that
"busing was a failure."</TE>
<TE>   Board members are hoping to find a solution that will address
community concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to raise the bar at all schools in the district," said
board member Peter Soelter. "We want to have an excellent school in every
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Clark is just the man to lead the district in its efforts, Soelter
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was chosen by a 7-0 vote," he said. "I think that's a pretty clear
mandate for moving forward."</TE>
<TE>   Clark also has the track record to persuade the board that the
initiative will be successful.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Clark has a proven record of leadership," Soelter said. "He's
actually gone out and done what we're trying to do."</TE>
<TE>   During Clark's 14-year tenure as superintendent of the Lawrence
Township School District in Indiana, test scores climbed and the school
year was extended. He created a math and science magnet school and an
elementary campus dedicated to international studies.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena officials hope that neighborhood schools will shorten
commuting times for students and increase parental involvement, factors
that Clark says are needed to boost achievement.</TE>
<TE>   He also hopes that the district will become more attractive to some of
the 8,000 students who now attend the more than 30 private schools in the
area.</TE>
<TE>   "I do expect that we will have more diversity in terms of white
students," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, about 3,000 white students left the school district in
anticipation of the desegregation order. That year, whites made up 53.7%
of the district's student population, down from 75% in 1961. Black
students represented 32.8% in 1970, and Latinos made up a little more
than 9%.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1980s, the number of white students and black students has
steadily declined as the number of Latinos continues to increase. Today,
the district's student population is 52.1% Latino, 28.5% black, 15.4%
white and 4% Asian.</TE>
<TE>   The demographics bear little resemblance to the city as a whole.
According to the 2000 census, Pasadena is 53.4% white, 14.4% black, 33.4%
Hispanic and 10% Asian. (The census allows people to choose Hispanic as
their ethnicity in addition to selecting race, so the total count equals
more than 100%.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's no longer simply a matter of how many white kids and how many
black kids," said Bill Bibbiani, the district's director of research and
testing, who has been charged with redrawing the attendance zones. "It
hasn't been that simple for quite some time."</TE>
<TE>   Still, attracting more white students is exactly what the district
needs, some say.</TE>
<TE>   "If we could get more white students in the district, it would
increase the diversity," said Nancy Dufford, who is white and has two
children in public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Parent Roberta Martinez said she placed her son in public school
because she wanted him to "experience greater diversity" than was offered
in private schools.</TE>
<TE>   The superintendent's plan, she said, "will add to the diversity in
schools, and help reconnect them with the larger community."</TE>
<TE>   The district has its own reasons for wishing for a return of private
school refugees, or at least for preventing more students from leaving in
the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Soelter said returning students will be a welcome byproduct of the
district's improvement efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to increase enrollment to increase revenues," he said.
California schools receive funding based on the number of students in
attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Although the district was released from the court order at the end of
1979, it has participated in voluntary desegregation since, receiving
about $1.5 million yearly from the state to help cover the cost of
busing. But new legislation has lifted the requirements for getting those
funds, said Bibbiani, the district's research director.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena schools will continue to receive the $1.5 million, but
without the same stipulations for its use. Through the elimination of
busing for desegregation, Clark said, the district hopes to save about
half of the $8 million it currently spends on busing each year.</TE>
<TE>   "It will certainly be better spent on reading, writing and arithmetic
than on a 45-minute bus ride," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   The district will hold two public meetings in early February to
present and explain the plan to the community. Despite Clark's charisma,
there are still those who will be a tough sell.</TE>
<TE>   Morse questions whether magnet schools will be enough to keep the
district from resegregating, though she acknowledges that the district
remains far from integrated today.</TE>
<TE>   She said that in the early 1970s, magnet programs became a haven for
the white students who remained in the district. Her recollection matches
that of Del Yarbrough, president of the Pasadena branch of the National
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People.</TE>
<TE>   Yarbrough worked for the school district nearly 30 years, from the
mid-'60s to the mid-'90s, serving in several capacities, from teacher to
principal.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have had integration in the schools, but segregated
classrooms," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins fears that will happen again. He expects that resegregation
will be the inevitable result of neighborhood schools, because he says
Pasadena neighborhoods are still divided along racial lines.</TE>
<TE>   "And where there are white kids, there will be better schools,"
Hopkins said. "It's called institutional racism."</TE>
<TE>   Clark says the plan is not a return to the past, but a vision for the
future.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is a historic time," he said. "I am incredibly respectful of the
warriors who really challenged segregation in schools. [But] to stay with
a dated structure is not working in the best interest of the children."</TE>
<TE>   Morse, who was on the search committee that brought Clark to Pasadena,
said she supports the superintendent even though she doesn't necessarily
agree with him.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they can make it work, but I'll have to see," she said, with
hope in her voice. "I want to believe, but they'll have to show me."</TE>

<LD>A man's body was found inside a burning shipping container at the
rear of a Sherman Oaks house Saturday morning, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire, reported shortly before 7 a.m., was confined to the inside
of a 30-foot metal container where the man lived, city fire spokesman Jim
Wells said.</LD>
<LD>   The homeowners apparently were allowing the man to stay in the
container, said Det. Rick Swanston of the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   The cause of death was under investigation.</TE>

<LD>As community groups, religious leaders and municipalities pause
Monday to commemorate the life and work of the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., a Sylmar man will he honored for embracing the late civil rights
leader's commitment to serve others.</LD>
<LD>   Baltazar Martinez, 22, will receive the Mayor Tom Bradley Award on
Monday night at the 14th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Commemoration
Service, hosted by the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council.</LD>
<LD>   The Mission College student was nominated by one of his teachers and
his pastor at Church of the Foothills in Sylmar. They cited his campus,
church and community volunteer work.</LD>
<TE>   Martinez heads Young Life, a nonprofit youth mentoring program. He
also works on San Fernando Mayor Cindy Montanez's campaign for state
Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Tecalitlan, Jalisco, Mexico, Martinez moved to Los Angeles
in 1991. He entered the fifth grade at Dyer Street Elementary School in
Sylmar unable to speak English.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said he worked hard in English-language classes at Olive
Vista Middle School and went on to graduate from the Sylmar Math Science
Magnet in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez earned an associate's degree in electronics from ITT
Technical Institute, but after working for the political campaign of Jose
Hernandez, a San Fernando city councilman and former mayor, he turned his
attention to politics.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of fixing TVs, I thought maybe I could fix communities," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Martinez was born a dozen years after King was assassinated
on April 4, 1968, he said he admires the Baptist preacher's refusal to
accept second-class citizenship in a segregated society.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though the circumstances were against him, he still went
forward," Martinez said. "I am an immigrant and even though I speak with
a thick accent, and sometimes people can't understand what I am saying, I
still move forward. I don't let things get in my way."</TE>
<TE>   The Interfaith Council's ecumenical program, "We Still Have a Dream,"
will be hosted by actor Roger Aaron Brown of the CBS-TV drama "The
District."</TE>
<TE>   Speakers representing the Bahai, Jewish, Islam, Buddhist and Christian
faiths will speak about peace and nonviolence from the perspective of
their religion, organizers said. An interfaith choir will perform.</TE>
<TE>   The free program begins at 6:30 p.m. Monday at Mary Immaculate
Catholic Church, 10390 Remick Ave., Pacoima. For information, call (818)
718-6460.</TE>
<TE>   Other Southern California observances include:</TE>

<HD>Residents Protest Moving of Bus Depot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angry residents rallied Saturday in Mission Hills to block
relocation of a Greyhound Lines bus depot to a neighborhood strip mall.</LD>
<LD>   More than 50 protesters and their children carried placards and
chanted, "Stop the buses," as they paraded in front of the proposed depot
in La Rinda Plaza at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Rinaldi Street.</LD>
<LD>   The residents said that a depot doesn't belong in the predominantly
residential neighborhood--that pollution, noise and traffic will ruin
their community.</LD>
<TE>   "What are we, chopped liver?" protest organizer Joe Lozano asked.
"These [Greyhound] people have really angered this community. No one told
us about it. No one held a town hall meeting. We want a town hall
meeting."</TE>
<TE>   The protesters said they prefer the current depot at 1441 Truman St.
in San Fernando because it is in a largely commercial area served by five
Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus routes, while only one line
serves the La Rinda Plaza location.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they should leave it right where it's at," said Connie Zamora
of Sylmar. "We don't want buses here. It brings riffraff and a lot of
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Council President Alex Padilla, San Fernando Mayor
Cindy Montanez and James Burkhardt, north Valley area director for Los
Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, joined the protesters in opposing the depot
relocation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are other sites that might be more accommodating for
Greyhound," Padilla said. "They haven't asked the people who live right
here if they want this."</TE>
<TE>   Greyhound spokeswoman Kristin Parsley said the site is zoned for buses
and the company obtained permits and approval from the city Planning
Department.</TE>
<TE>   "We did try to be sensitive to the community by reducing the number of
schedules from 35 to 28 per day," Parsley said, explaining that 14 buses
would enter and leave the depot daily. Greyhound will also limit its
hours of operation from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The company is moving the depot because its lease on the Truman Street
location is expiring. The La Rinda site is desirable because it's close
to Interstate 5, Parsley said, adding that Greyhound plans to move into
the new location Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Greyhound tried to open a depot at the La Rinda site 20 years ago, but
the plan failed because of opposition from neighboring merchants and
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bad idea then and it's a bad idea now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla won City Council approval Tuesday of a measure to post signs
banning vehicles weighing more than 6,000 pounds from using streets in
the adjacent residential neighborhoods, a move he hopes will encourage
the bus company to seek another site.</TE>

<LD>   A resident of the 1100 block of West 23rd Street in San Pedro called

Lee Perez, 36, jump her backyard fence and go into her garage, said LAPD
Officer Eduardo Funes. Officers found Perez hiding in the garage and he
was taken into custody without incident, Funes said. Perez, who has
previous convictions for robbery and domestic violence, will be booked on

<HD>Working to Save a Haven in Violent Turf Despite Killing</HD>
<DH>Community: Rec center staffers built bond with gang members,
treating them as the neighbors they are. Teen tutor's death won't deter
them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a decade, St. Andrews Park Recreation Center in South Los
Angeles stood as a haven from gang violence. In the never-ending battle
to rid parks of gang crime, an uncommon truce was struck by park staffers
who did not fight gang members--they welcomed them.</LD>
<LD>   And peace prevailed.</LD>
<LD>   A disheartening coda to that work occurred, however, when two
suspected gang members entered the center's lobby Nov. 28 to gun down
13-year-old Marquese Rashad Prude, a tutor in the center's after-school
program. He wasn't a gang member.</LD>
<TE>   Before the shooting, Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks
staffers at St. Andrews shunned a heavy police presence at the park,
choosing instead to deal with gang members themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The staffers tore down signs prohibiting loitering and, they say,
earned the respect of gang members by treating them like anyone else.
Rather than hassle gang members with questions, they asked them to form
basketball teams and urged them to bring their children to play.</TE>
<TE>   Now, police frequently patrol the park, some city officials want
volunteers to help escort residents across the grounds, and some
residents have urged authorities to "get the snakes out."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the noisiest residents are skeptical of the staffers' longtime
tactics of trying to pacify gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the community members make the observation that it's hard to
distinguish the people with gang ties from the people who run the park,"
said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents the area.</TE>
<TE>   "A huge investment has been made into this park over the years," he
added. "I don't think it should be a comfortable place for people who
don't respect other people's rights."</TE>
<TE>   Adding to murky waters that officials such as Ridley-Thomas are
entering is the fact that Prude's killers have not been caught. Los
Angeles Police Capt. Jim Miller called the investigation "fairly focused"
but said witnesses have been uncooperative.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, no one knows the exact reason for the slaying. What
is known is that in the area, St. Andrews still is relatively safe,
Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD's 77th Street Division, whose territory includes the park,
led all other divisions with 82 homicides in 2001; about 50 of them were
gang-related, police said.</TE>
<TE>   But until Prude's killing, the park had escaped that violence. Among
the vacant lots and grocery stores on Manchester Avenue--about a dozen
blocks east of Hollywood Park--St. Andrews is shielded from the busy
street by shrubs. Covering one city block and positioned on a small hill
in a neighborhood of modest one-story homes, the park stands like a
queen.</TE>
<TE>   Even on the surface, staffers say, you can tell it is safe.</TE>
<TE>   "Graffiti tells stories," said Assistant Director Rayford Miles. "Just
by the fact that there is no graffiti, that tells you it's a respectable
park. . . . Graffiti doesn't come here."</TE>
<TE>   Said area resident William Givens: "If it does, it's in Crayola."</TE>
<TE>   Miles believes that park workers have successfully navigated among the
22 active gangs in the 77th Division, even keeping the peace with the
83rd Street Gangsters, who claim the area that includes St. Andrews.
Members of a rival gang are believed to be responsible for Prude's death,
Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   The park started as a clubhouse and playground in 1949, but was
languishing by the 1970s as gangs began using it as a meeting place. Gang
members scared away families and athletic teams.</TE>
<TE>   "You might have thought it was closed," Miles said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the park did close after money was found for a new building
and new equipment. It reopened in 1992. The turning point occurred at the
first meeting of the new staff, which was composed entirely of people
from the nearby neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, St. Andrews staffers came from all over the city. Miles
was part of the new group and is one of three originals who remain.</TE>
<TE>   "It helped get people talking in the community. We were home-grown. It
was ours," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Coming from the area, they also knew the nearby gang members and
decided early on to include them in the renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   "Gang members need to play too," Miles said.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, basketball, baseball, tennis and academic groups have come
to use the facility. Annual revenue from those groups increased from
$28,000 to $160,000 in just the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   "We defied the odds," Miles said.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of four surrounding parks have used St. Andrews as a model for
how to live peacefully in a violent area. Gang experts said St. Andrews
staffers were right to handle gangs themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Noblet, a consultant to gang-intervention programs, said, "You
can't separate the gang from the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   The shooting of Prude doesn't necessarily call for changing direction
now, he said. "Because you have an anomaly, that doesn't mean that you
should rethink your strategy."</TE>
<TE>   But about a week after Prude's death, the mayor, police chief,
district attorney and City Council members all came to march against
violence in the area surrounding St. Andrews. They brought new ideas,
such as arming park rangers and stepping up surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   While residents met with the officials, one woman yelled out her plan
for dealing with the gangs: "People at these parks have been lying with
snakes. Get the snakes out."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview after the meeting, Police Chief Bernard C. Parks was
adamant about the stepped-up patrols.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents--including Prude's mother, Sharon--left the meeting
skeptical about the officials' response.</TE>
<TE>   At an impromptu news conference, she advocated continued cooperation
with gang members, maybe even holding a gang summit. Asked if she knew
she might be cooperating with a group that includes her son's killers,
Prude said, "Yes."</TE>

<HD>Program Provides the First Lesson in Proper Behavior</HD>
<DH>Education: The Skills for Life curriculum used by a Ventura
elementary school aims to curb violence by teaching students self-control
and respect.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The second-graders in Hadley Rick's class at E.P. Foster Elementary
School stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes fixed forward.</LD>
<LD>   Gradually, bubbles begin to dance across the room, just centimeters
from their faces. The glistening, soapy spheres beg to be popped, but the
children allow them to float to the floor.</LD>
<LD>   "Look at that self-control!" exclaims Jon Oliver, director of the
Massachusetts-based Lesson One Foundation, during a recent visit to the
Ventura school. "That's the same self-control you would use if a bully
comes by, or if someone tries to give you drugs or alcohol."</LD>
<TE>   The exercise is part of Oliver's Skills for Life program, a curriculum
that aims to prevent school violence by teaching kids in kindergarten
through fifth grade how to control themselves, respect others and avoid
violent behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Oliver's program--what he calls "the ABCs of life"--has been used on
the East Coast for nearly 30 years. Demand for it elsewhere has soared in
recent years, particularly after shootings at Columbine High School in
Colorado and Santana High School near San Diego put a national spotlight
on campus safety.</TE>
<TE>   E.P. Foster, in a Ventura neighborhood plagued for years by gangs, is
the first school in California to fully implement the program, Oliver
said.</TE>
<TE>   "What a gift to give these children, with all the turmoil in their
lives," Principal Michael Babb said. "We're sending these kids out into
the future with these skills, and they're going to need them."</TE>
<TE>   Skills for Life is based on a "Pledge for Success" that children and
teachers recite each day. It includes promises to wait their turn to
speak, to always try their best and to treat others the way they want to
be treated.</TE>
<TE>Games Help Make Abstract Concepts Real</TE>
<TE>   The curriculum employs often-repeated phrases such as "use your
self-control," "take responsibility" and "celebrate diversity." Games and
simple stories help make the abstract concepts real.</TE>
<TE>   In Rick's class last week, Oliver sat at the front of the room with a
cylinder filled with colorful rocks. Moving it back and forth, he asked
the students to close their eyes and think about what it sounded like.</TE>
<TE>   "A strong rainstorm," said one student.</TE>
<TE>   "Making popcorn," offered another.</TE>
<TE>   "A waterfall!" piped another.</TE>
<TE>   The exercise is teaching kids that different people perceive things
differently, Oliver said, and that they should celebrate that diversity.
It also gives them problem-solving skills, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of feeling stuck, you can think of all the different answers
there might be to one question," he told them.</TE>
<TE>   At E.P. Foster, Lesson One has become part of the school's culture.
All teachers require students to take "self-control time"--in which
everyone sits still, breathing deeply with eyes closed for three
minutes--three times a day. And the vocabulary is used constantly by
teachers, administrators and students.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at E.P. Foster found out about the program two years ago
from a volunteer who had seen a presentation at a violence-prevention
seminar.</TE>
<TE>   Training and materials are funded mostly through grants obtained by
the school or through the nonprofit Lesson One Foundation, Oliver said.</TE>
<TE>   Since E.P. Foster started using the curriculum, officials say they
have witnessed a turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer students are being sent to the principal's office for
discipline. Spats on the playground are less frequent. Educators are
spending less time trying to control their classes and more time
teaching.</TE>
<TE>   Logan Culp, who teaches fifth grade at the school, said there has been
a marked improvement in his students' behavior this year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fifth-grade class that was pretty much well-known as
fourth-graders for being difficult," Culp said. "It's pretty amazing."</TE>
<TE>   After Oliver's visit last week, Culp's students talked about how the
program has helped them.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I want to give up on stuff, but it helps to know I just
have to try my best," said Kyle O'Kelley, 10.</TE>
<TE>   "In fourth grade I used to call people names," said Savannah
Hottinger, 11. "I don't think I'd like to be treated that way."</TE>
<TE>   Parents said the classroom lessons have also found their way into the
home. Darcy Mendelson said that when her son, Michael, gets worked up and
frustrated, she asks him to take "self-control time."</TE>
<TE>   "He'll start the breathing, and then slowly the tears stop and he
calms down. Once he's calmed down, we can talk about why he's upset," she
said. "It's a miraculous thing."</TE>

<LD>Speeches, concerts, art shows and a march through Oxnard are among
events in Ventura County on Monday to celebrate Martin Luther King Day.</LD>
<LD>   Festivities, including prayer and music, begin in Oxnard at 8:15 a.m.
with a three-quarter mile walk from Plaza Park to the Oxnard Performing
Arts Center at 800 Hobson Way.</LD>
<LD>   Perry J. Ludy, a businessman and motivational speaker, will be the
keynote speaker.</LD>
<TE>   Participants in the walk can park their cars at the center and take a
shuttle bus to Plaza Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this is the one day that we will all celebrate Martin Luther
King's birthday," said John Hatcher, president of the Ventura County
chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, and
a participant in the Oxnard events. King's "message should mean a lot,
and the celebration should be about more than just a day off work. He was
out there marching and dealing with discrimination in this country."</TE>
<TE>   King was assassinated in 1968 in Memphis, Tenn., where he had gone to
support sanitation workers striking for better work conditions. He was
39. Jan. 15 was King's 73rd birthday.</TE>
<TE>   His birthday became the 10th federal holiday in 1986 and the first to
be authorized by Congress since Thanksgiving in 1941.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks from the Performing Arts Center event, the Ventura County
Rescue Mission will hold a banquet and salute to King starting at 11:30
a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Events will include a reenactment of King's "I Have a Dream" speech by
the Rev. Calvern Green, a graduate of the mission's drug and alcohol
recovery program and now a minister at South Coast Fellowship in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   The banquet will feature home-cooked soul food prepared by culinary
students at the mission, said Carol Roberg, the mission's executive
director. An original hip-hop song written to celebrate King's birthday
will be performed by a resident in the mission's drug and alcohol
recovery program. The mission is at 234 E. 6th St.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these people are without hope, and we try to celebrate all
the holidays for them," Roberg said, referring to mission clients. "My
goal is to make the African American people feel very special. So many
times they are discriminated against, so we want to honor them."</TE>
<TE>   Ojai will celebrate the civil rights leader's birthday with a series
of concerts, poetry readings and art displays Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers expect more than 300 people to attend events, including
discussions on racism and cultural awareness at Chaparral Continuation
High School auditorium. At Libbey Park, several bands and musicians will
perform from noon to 5 p.m., said Kelly McCormick, an organizer.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley Second Missionary Baptist Church will feature a sermon at
10 a.m. by Assemblyman Carl Washington (D-Paramount).</TE>

<LD>The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is offering a $50,000 reward for
information leading to the arrests and convictions of those responsible
for stealing mail from two postal workers in Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   On Dec. 13, someone entered a mail truck in the 2500 block of Saviers
Road, shoved the driver to the side and grabbed two mailbags before
fleeing down an alley, officials said. On Jan. 10, a man entered a postal
truck on Rice Avenue and ordered the employee to drive to a secluded
area, where the man grabbed a mailbag and fled in a car with another man,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Officials do not know whether the robberies are linked. Anyone with
information on the crimes is urged to call postal inspectors at (626)
405-1208.</LD>

<LD>A friend and I were shooting the breeze some years ago, and the
conversation turned to a budding legal issue involving a church. I don't
remember the details, but I do remember what my friend said.</LD>
<LD>   The case probably put the church in a bind, he said, because of the
biblical admonition against suing.</LD>
<LD>   Say what? I know my Ten Commandments but had never heard that suing
was even in the same ballpark as adultery.</LD>
<TE>   Actually, it's not--you have to travel ahead to 1 Corinthians in the
New Testament to find it:</TE>
<TE>   "If any of you has a dispute with another, dare he take it before the
ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints?"</TE>
<TE>   The old conversation with my friend comes to mind because Cottonwood
Christian Center--an evangelical megachurch in Los Alamitos with more
than 4,000 members--is suing the city of Cypress over a land-use dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The church believes, with justification, that Cypress doesn't want it
to build a giant religious complex at the intersection of Katella Avenue
and Walker Street. The city wants to develop that choice location with
tax-generating retail outlets.</TE>
<TE>   I don't have a legal opinion. I just wonder whether Cottonwood, even
though it owns the land in question and never made any secret of its
intentions to expand there, feels any squeamishness about suing.</TE>
<TE>   Forget the civil code.</TE>
<TE>   How about the Bible?</TE>
<TE>   The church is in good shape on both counts, says Mike Wilson, the
project manager and an ordained minister. The Scriptures clearly are
referring to one believer suing another believer, he says. What it
doesn't preclude, he says, is the church suing a governmental entity.</TE>
<TE>   "As Christians, in Romans it says to respect and honor authority,"
Wilson says, "but authorities have also set up recourse for us to appeal.
This is not disrespectful to government at all. We're just using what's
provided to us to get our new home."</TE>
<TE>   Additional verses in chapter 6 of 1 Corinthians make it fairly clear
that Paul the Apostle is talking about legal actions between believers.
But who among us is to cast the first stone and call the city of Cypress
"nonbelievers?"</TE>
<TE>   Don't get the idea, however, that the church is eager to sue.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not what we're about," Wilson says. "We're about people. We
need to expand our facilities. This [the legal world] isn't our realm.
We're not comfortable with all the hassles attached to getting a new
building."</TE>
<TE>   I ask Wilson if the biblical injunction against lawsuits is considered
irrelevant in today's litigious world.</TE>
<TE>   No, he says. Scripture is always relevant, and Cottonwood interprets
the Bible literally.</TE>
<TE>   Would the church, then, try to stop one congregant from suing another?</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't try to force anybody's decision on that," Wilson says.
"We can encourage them and try to get the parties together, but beyond
that, we wouldn't try and have influence."</TE>
<TE>   I can just see all you nonbelievers out there rolling your eyes. Just
another convenient reading of Scripture, you're saying--just like Jesus'
often-unheeded counsel to turn the other cheek.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if Cottonwood interpreted Paul's words to mean it
shouldn't sue anyone, it would be battling the city with only charm and
persuasiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Most people today find a good subpoena works much better.</TE>
<TE>   "Through much prayer and counsel from our attorneys, we decided we
must file the lawsuit," church leaders wrote in a letter to the editor of
a local newspaper. "The bottom line is we must protect our mission."</TE>
<TE>   If the church were as glib as others might choose to be, it would warn
Cypress that "Thou shalt not yanketh Cottonwood's chain."</TE>
<TE>   It has chosen, instead, to take the high road and invoke a little Old
Testament reminder found in Joshua 1:9:</TE>
<TE>   "Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage. Do not be
afraid, nor be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you
go."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody can tell Cypress' legal team it hasn't been warned.</TE>

<HD>Crystal Cove Restoration Financing Plan Rejected</HD>
<DH>Parks: Assemblyman said he proposed rent hike and lease extension
at El Morro Village to expedite project.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Parks Department has rejected an assemblyman's proposal
to extend the leases and raise the rents of residents at El Morro Village
to pay for restoration of the nearby historic cottage district in Crystal
Cove State Park.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) had proposed in October extending
the leases at the oceanfront village between Corona del Mar and Laguna
Beach for an additional 10 years while doubling the rents.</LD>
<LD>   Renovation of the historic district, considered the last intact
example of a 1920s-era Southern California beach colony, could cost as
much as $15 million, said state parks spokesman Roy Stearns.</LD>
<TE>   Campbell had said the weakened economy and cuts in Gov. Gray Davis'
budget could stall restoration of the cottages for years and saw the
lease extension and higher rents as a way to hasten the process.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like a solution designed primarily to keep those El Morro
residents right where they are for another 10 years," Stearns said.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Areias, director of the Parks Department, said: "Extensions won
by the renters have kept them living in a state park for . . . 20 years.
How long should the public wait to watch the sunset from an El Morro
campsite?"</TE>
<TE>   Stearns added that "there are other places we can look" for funds,
including possible special legislation, the California Coastal
Conservancy "and others."</TE>
<TE>   The 294 tenants at El Morro pay rents for their spaces that range from
$300 to $700 a month for one of Orange County's most picturesque spots.</TE>
<TE>   Other state agencies and environmentalists have lined up against
Campbell's proposal, saying all it would do is maintain public land as a
private enclave for the privileged few lucky enough to own or rent a
mobile home there.</TE>
<TE>   "The sole reason I'm doing this is to fund Crystal Cove," Campbell
said. "If we can find funding through another method, I'll drop this
proposal."</TE>
<TE>   Campbell said he has until late February before he has to introduce
any legislation.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he said, "I'm pleased that the proposal is getting
everyone to look under every rock to see where we might find money."</TE>

<HD>2 Plead Guilty in Black Star Attacks</HD>
<DH>Courts: Teens will admit to kidnapping and robbery, but not rape,
and won't be tried as adults. Two others still face 39 felony charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two teenage members of a gang accused of raping two girls and
beating their boyfriends in Black Star Canyon last summer have reached a
plea agreement with prosecutors, a defense attorney said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The teens, Veruk Kim, 17, and Phu Tran, 15, will plead guilty to
charges of kidnapping, robbery and other crimes but will not face sexual
assault charges, defense attorney Doug Myers said.</LD>
<LD>   Myers, who is representing Tran, said the plea bargain eliminates the
possibility that the juveniles could be tried as adults, and effectively
caps their sentences at eight to 10 years. As juveniles, they will be
sentenced to a California Youth Authority facility, where they can be
held until they are 25 years old.</LD>
<TE>   Kim, Tran and three other teens had been accused of repeatedly raping
two girls, ages 13 and 15, and beating their boyfriends, ages 16 and 17,
while they were in the remote east Orange County canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Myers declined to say why Tran has agreed to plead guilty, but told
The Times in a previous interview that both Tran and Kim had tried to
stop the attacks and were not involved in the rapes.</TE>
<TE>   Erick Oswaldo Dominguez of Anaheim and Cuahutemoc Torres of Orange,
both 19, face 39 felony counts each. Their next court hearing is
scheduled Feb. 1. Prosecutors are seeking to try a third suspect, Jesus
Rene Green, 16, as an adult.</TE>

<HD>Orange Parties in Refurbished Plaza 'Living Room'</HD>
<DH>Restoration: After eight months of work and $2.1 million, the
city's heart beats again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was like a scene from the old "Andy Griffith Show," but it
wasn't Mayberry, it was Orange, where about 500 gathered Saturday to
rededicate the town's historic plaza.</LD>
<LD>   The daylong celebration featured bands and free sweets, and celebrated
an eight-month preservation effort that gave the Old Towne Orange Plaza a
face lift. The plaza now has freshly paved streets and new sidewalks. And
the repaired vintage street clocks and Plaza Park fountain now work.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great day in the community," said Mayor Mark Murphy, standing
next to a grandstand in the plaza's small circular park. The cool January
air rustled red, white and blue balloons, and carried the smell of fresh
popcorn.</LD>
<TE>   "We're celebrating our heritage," he added. "This is a community of
generations, and the plaza is the heart of the city. . . . I can't
imagine how many pictures of family events have been taken here."</TE>
<TE>   The $2.1-million project did not dramatically change the plaza's look.
The city didn't want to do that--there's 130 years of history behind the
plaza, and it's listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It
also periodically appears in movies, commercials and television shows.</TE>
<TE>   "The signs of wear and tear have been removed," Murphy said. "And all
the historic elements have been preserved. Everything looks as it did in
the 1930s and '40s."</TE>
<TE>   Residents seemed generally pleased with the results. The park has a
cleaner look. It's easier to cross streets. And now the fountain lights
up at night.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it," said Julie Hanson, a 15-year resident. "It really does
look lovely."</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone is happy. Some complain the sparkled concrete
sidewalks that replaced red-brick pavers are blinding when the sun hits
them. Others miss the brick planters that graced the four quadrants of
the plaza. The city took those out to accommodate sidewalk dining at a
couple of restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Hank's Barber Shop owner Hank Mascolo--often referred to as "the
honorary mayor of the downtown plaza"--said he fought to keep the brick
walkways.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the finished product is beautiful, but I miss the brick,"
Mascolo said.</TE>
<TE>   And some merchants are concerned about making up for lost revenue. The
streets and sidewalks were torn up for months, making it difficult for
shoppers to park.</TE>
<TE>   "Business was down at least 40% during construction," said Brian
McBroom, owner of J&amp;J Antiques. "It was very disruptive for business, and
it took way too long. . . . I could have had three of my cousins and
myself come in, and we could have done a better job."</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't like the concrete walkways either.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no character to concrete," he said. "Aesthetically, I think
it's very unappealing."</TE>
<TE>   But the city's restoration committee--made up of residents, historical
society members, city officials and merchants--said consideration went
into each decision, including the move to replace the brick. City
officials said the concrete walkways are reminiscent of the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   "It truly was a restoration and preservation effort," said Randy
Bosch, a former planning commissioner and committee member. "It wasn't
our goal to tear things down and create something new. And we got rid of
some things that never should have been here in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   The plaza's beginnings date to the late 1800s, when the plaza was used
primarily as a hitching and watering area for local ranchers and
sheepherders. By 1887, the townsfolk raised $535 from bake sales and a
play and turned the area into a park--complete with a fountain, which was
replaced by an electric one in 1937.</TE>
<TE>   A ceremony was held to mark that occasion as well, with 4-year-old
Nancy Joy Shryock flipping the switch to start the new fountain. History
repeated itself Saturday, when the same Nancy, now Nancy Hedrick, still
living in Orange, turned on the fountain again.</TE>
<TE>   City officials hope things can get back to normal downtown--with
shoppers strolling in and out of shops, picnickers eating their lunches
in the park, and business proceeding at a steady pace.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bosch: "It's good to have our living room back."</TE>

<LD>Four men who may be responsible for a string of bank robberies in
south Orange County hit another bank Saturday morning in San Juan
Capistrano, sheriff's officials said.</LD>
<LD>   While an accomplice waited in a getaway car, three men, at least two
of whom were armed, stormed into the Wells Fargo Bank at 32222 Camino
Capistrano about 10:30 a.m. and ordered people down, Sheriff's Lt. Larry
Abbott said.</LD>
<LD>   The men, wearing ski masks and dark clothing, demanded cash and then
fled with an undisclosed amount in a stolen car. The car was later found
nearby, where police believe they had another car waiting.</LD>

<HD>Montana Drivers Push Limits on Drinking</HD>
<DH>Laws: Lax road-safety statutes on imbibing are costing the state
money--and lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB ANEZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HELENA, Mont.
</DL>
<LD>Loose laws and a cowboy culture that condones drinking behind the
wheel are being blamed for a disturbing fact in Big Sky country: People
on Montana's roads are more likely to die in alcohol-related crashes than
motorists in almost any other state.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000, Montana had the nation's second-highest rate of
alcohol-related traffic deaths, trailing only Mississippi.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a cultural element in Montana that drinking's OK and drinking
and driving's OK. It's been around for a long time," said Bill Muhs of
Bozeman, whose daughter was killed by a drunken driver 11 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Driving in the Big Sky State is a necessity. Montana, the
fourth-largest state in area, spans 300 miles between Wyoming and the
Canadian border. Driving the 550 miles across Montana is like going from
Portland, Maine, to Richmond, Va.</TE>
<TE>   For more than three years during the 1990s, Montana drivers were
allowed to go as fast as they wanted as long as it was "reasonable and
proper" based on traffic, road conditions and weather. It was only two
years ago that speed limits were added to the state's 70,000 miles of
highway.</TE>
<TE>   Montana has resisted lowering its legal blood-alcohol limit from 0.10%
to 0.08%, as more than half the states have done.</TE>
<TE>   And unlike 34 other states, Montana allows open alcoholic-beverage
containers in vehicles outside cities, which means drivers can--and
do--have a beer while they cruise the long highways.</TE>
<TE>   "In your rural areas of the West, there's an attitude that drinking is
a right and you should be able to drink and do whatever you want to do,"
said Mona Sumner, clinical director of the Rimrock Foundation rehab
center in Billings.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000 in Montana, population 902,000, 110 people died in
alcohol-related traffic accidents. Over the last seven years, the death
toll has averaged just over 100 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The rate of alcohol-related traffic fatalities in Montana in 2000 was
12.19 deaths per 100,000 residents, just behind Mississippi at 13.32. In
1999, Montana had the nation's highest alcohol-related traffic death rate
per 100 million miles traveled, at 1.05.</TE>
<TE>   Warren Strain of Mississippi's Department of Public Safety said his
state's 0.10% limit and its lack of an open-container law are major
factors in Mississippi's death toll. "We feel action in these two areas
would go a long way toward changing this terrible statistic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Drunken-driving penalties in Montana range from a $100 fine and 24
hours in jail for a first conviction to a $10,000 fine and 13 months in
prison for a fourth conviction. A first-time conviction results in the
loss of a driver's license for six months--with exceptions available for
work--and requires enrollment in an alcohol-treatment program.</TE>
<TE>   Muhs, vice president of a local chapter of Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, wants a ban on open containers and a drop in the legal limit to
0.08%.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government is turning up the pressure by withholding
highway construction money. Montana already is losing $11 million every
year because it has refused to ban open containers or get tougher on
repeat offenders. The state could also lose an additional $15 million a
year if the legal limit is not lowered to 0.08%.</TE>
<TE>   Montana Atty. Gen. Mike McGrath and Al Goke, chief of Montana's
Traffic and Safety Bureau, question whether lowering the legal limit will
do much good, since the average blood-alcohol level of those arrested is
0.17%.</TE>

<HD>A Quick Study of Community Activism</HD>
<DH>Civics: About 400 people learn the ins and outs of city government
at empowerment seminar.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 400 community activists-in-training took crash courses in
the art of effective advocacy and learned the ins and outs of city
government during the 8th District Empowerment Congress on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Held at USC, the session featured hourlong workshops on subjects
ranging from how to find funding for neighborhood groups to navigating
City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas organized the annual
event in 1992, and touted its success.</LD>
<TE>   "We've created a model of civic engagement at the local level,"
Ridley-Thomas said, noting that past participants have "helped write
legislation, demonstrated against violence in the community and demanded
high standards and accountability from city government." Ridley-Thomas'
8th District extends south from the Santa Monica Freeway to 110th Street,
and from east to west roughly from Crenshaw to the Harbor Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Residents from at least six of the city's 15 council districts
attended, according to organizers, as well as a variety of city
officials, nonprofit groups and businesspeople.</TE>
<TE>   Olivia Allison has been frustrated in her attempts to make a home she
owns in the Mid-City area available for community programs. After
attending a workshop on leadership training with her granddaughter,
Keyama Underwood, Allison said she was encouraged.</TE>
<TE>   "I got so much information," she said, slipping a business card
someone handed her into her purse. "I learned how to start looking for
resources to improve the property so I can do something with it."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, the keynote speaker at the event, invoked Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. in praising the participants.</TE>
<TE>   "Let us continue to honor Dr. King's legacy by rededicating ourselves
to a life of service to our fellow human beings," he said.</TE>

<HD>Mission Hills Residents Protest Moving of Bus Depot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angry residents rallied Saturday in Mission Hills to block
relocation of a Greyhound Lines bus depot to a neighborhood strip mall.</LD>
<LD>   More than 50 protesters and their children carried placards and
chanted, "Stop the buses," as they paraded in front of the proposed depot
in La Rinda Plaza at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Rinaldi Street.</LD>
<LD>   The residents said that a depot doesn't belong in the predominantly
residential neighborhood--that pollution, noise and traffic will ruin
their community.</LD>
<TE>   "What are we, chopped liver?" protest organizer Joe Lozano asked.
"These [Greyhound] people have really angered this community. No one told
us about it. No one held a town hall meeting. We want a town hall
meeting."</TE>
<TE>   The protesters said they prefer the current depot at 1441 Truman St.
in San Fernando because it is in a largely commercial area served by five
Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus routes, while only one line
serves the La Rinda Plaza location.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they should leave it right where it's at," said Connie Zamora
of Sylmar. "We don't want buses here. It brings riffraff and a lot of
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Council President Alex Padilla, San Fernando Mayor
Cindy Montanez and James Burkhardt, north Valley area director for Los
Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, joined the protesters in opposing the depot
relocation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are other sites that might be more accommodating for
Greyhound," Padilla said. "They haven't asked the people who live right
here if they want this."</TE>
<TE>   Greyhound spokeswoman Kristin Parsley said the site is zoned for buses
and the company obtained permits and approval from the city Planning
Department.</TE>
<TE>   "We did try to be sensitive to the community by reducing the number of
schedules from 35 to 28 per day," Parsley said, explaining that 14 buses
would enter and leave the depot daily. Greyhound will also limit its
hours of operation from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The company is moving the depot because its lease on the Truman Street
location is expiring. The La Rinda site is desirable because it's close
to Interstate 5, Parsley said, adding that Greyhound plans to move into
the new location Jan. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Greyhound tried to open a depot at the La Rinda site 20 years ago, but
the plan failed because of opposition from neighboring merchants and
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bad idea then and it's a bad idea now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla won City Council approval Tuesday of a measure to post signs
banning vehicles weighing more than 6,000 pounds from using streets in
the adjacent residential neighborhoods, a move he hopes will encourage
the bus company to seek another site.</TE>

<HD>A Mother's Love Was the Death of Her Daughter-in-Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The worst mother-in-law in California was also the last woman to be
executed in the state, in 1962.</LD>
<LD>   Elizabeth Ann "Ma" Duncan was 58. She had stalked and finally ordered
the death of her pregnant daughter-in-law in an example of mother love
gone wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Only four women have been executed in California since 1893; the
records are unclear whether any were put to death by local agencies
before then. All four were convicted murderers.</LD>
<TE>   The first woman to die in San Quentin's gas chamber was Juanita
Spinelli, in 1941. Known as "The Duchess," she led a San Francisco crime
gang. Spinelli was convicted of killing a gang member to prevent him from
squealing about a murder.</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, Louise Peete was sent to the gas chamber for robbing
and killing a woman who had befriended her while she was in prison. In
the 1920s, Peete had killed her employer, who was also her lover.</TE>
<TE>   And Barbara Graham, an attractive "gun moll," was convicted, along
with two accomplices, of strangling and beating to death a wealthy
disabled Burbank widow. Her execution--seven years before Ma
Duncan's--was graphically and sympathetically depicted in the 1958
Oscar-winning Susan Hayward film "I Want to Live."</TE>
<TE>   Ma Duncan's 1959 trial focused a harsh spotlight on Ventura County,
where the prosecution painted a grim portrait of an overbearing, obsessed
and terrifying mother, consumed with an intense hatred for her pregnant
daughter-in-law and a perverse love for her son--so much that she
resorted to murder to separate him from his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Before she hired two thugs to murder the wife, Ma Duncan had tried to
break up their marriage by impersonating her daughter-in-law at an
annulment hearing and paying a stranger to pose as her son.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was just as bizarre as the crime. Ma Duncan's son, Frank
Patrick Duncan, a Santa Barbara attorney whom she always called "mama's
little boy," didn't appear to hold a grudge; he even helped to defend his
mother at trial.</TE>
<TE>   It was also the first time Ventura County Dist. Atty. Roy Gustafson
prosecuted a capital murder case under a state law he wrote that created
a separate penalty phase of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, Ma Duncan was living in Long Beach with the youngest of her
six children, Patsy Ann, 15. When Patsy Ann died of a "spontaneous
cerebral hemorrhage," Ma Duncan's life changed dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next decade, she drifted in and out of 10 or 20 marriages, in
some cases not bothering to divorce one man before marrying another. She
wrote bad checks, used false names and once served 30 days in jail in San
Francisco for running a brothel. She lured several husbands on the false
promise of money coming her way, and she once lied about her age to
another husband--one of her son's law school classmates--even promising
that she would give him a baby.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1957, Ma Duncan moved in with her favorite child, Frank,
who lived in Santa Barbara. He tried to sort out her marital tangles, but
when she refused to cooperate, he ordered her to move out.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she took an overdose of sleeping pills. While she was
recuperating, Frank got to know her nurse, 30-year-old Canadian-born Olga
Kupczyk.</TE>
<TE>   As the two dated and fell in love, Ma Duncan's health returned and her
wrath grew. She was possessive and didn't want anyone interfering in
Frank's life or career, or coming between her and "mama's little boy."</TE>
<TE>   In June 1958, Frank and Olga were married. When Frank told his mother,
she became hysterical. "There was uncontrollable weeping and she begged
me to return home," Frank later testified. "I felt like a yo-yo, bouncing
back and forth between both women."</TE>
<TE>   To keep the peace, Frank visited his wife in her own apartment every
night, but went home to sleep at the apartment he shared with his mother.
Still, Olga soon was pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   After Frank left for work each morning, his mother telephoned Olga or
went to her apartment to threaten the woman, hoping to scare her out of
town. When that failed, she bought a gun and threatened to kill herself
in front of her son. He took the gun away.</TE>
<TE>   Olga feared for her life and that of her unborn baby. She told her
girlfriends and wrote to her parents about her fears. She moved from
apartment to apartment to keep away from Ma Duncan. But when she told
Frank about his mother's threats, he refused to believe it; his mother
told him it wasn't true.</TE>
<TE>   When the harassment and threats didn't work, Ma Duncan began to offer
money to friends to help her kill Olga. Among them was a carhop to whom
she offered $1,500 to throw acid in Olga's face and then push her off a
cliff. The waitress told Frank, but when he again confronted his mother,
she again denied it.</TE>
<TE>   No one went to the police.</TE>
<TE>   Through a friend, Ma Duncan found two men, Luis Moya and Augustine
Baldonado, and they reached a price: $3,000 for the job.</TE>
<TE>   She pawned some jewelry for $175, stole $200 from her son's wallet,
kept a few bucks for herself and gave them a down payment of $335.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 18, 1958, Moya and Baldonado borrowed a car and a gun and
lured Olga from her apartment on the pretext that her husband was drunk
in the back seat of their car. She was still in her bathrobe and slippers
when they shoved her inside the car. She fought back, kicking and
scratching. The men panicked and pistol-whipped her so hard that they
broke the borrowed gun.</TE>
<TE>   They beat her again, choked her and dumped her body in a shallow grave
they dug in a culvert at the Casitas Dam construction site near Ojai. No
one knows whether she was dead or alive when they buried her.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks later, both men were arrested on unrelated charges. Ma Duncan,
fearing the men would spill their murderous secret, told her son that
they had been blackmailing her about the annulment she tried to stage.
Her son went to police, intending to get the men in more legal trouble.</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't work out that way. Police soon became suspicious about
Olga's disappearance and pressed the men, who confessed and implicated Ma
Duncan. They would later say that if they had known Olga was pregnant,
they would not have killed her.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County was horrified--a mother-in-law accused of killing her
son's wife and her own unborn grandchild. The courtroom was crowded from
Day One.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Duncan defended his mother, joined by Los Angeles attorney S.
Ward Sullivan. Five years earlier, Sullivan had lost the case defending
Jack Santo and Emmett Perkins, the accomplices of good-time girl Barbara
Graham. Along with Graham, they were sentenced to death.</TE>
<TE>   At the attorneys' table and on the witness stand, Frank was not the
picture of a grief-stricken husband. Although he testified that his
relationship with his wife was one of "love and affection," he also
admitted that he had never so much as talked to her in the 10 days before
her disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if his mother tried to break up his marriage, he replied,
"Let's just say she hindered its development."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the prosecution's 44 witnesses, including the hit men, Ma
Duncan steadfastly denied any knowledge of the crime. Four weeks after
the trial began, Ma Duncan was convicted of first-degree murder and
sentenced to be executed.</TE>
<TE>   Moya and Baldonado, who had already confessed and been sentenced to
death, tried to flee by sawing through their cell bars with smuggled
hacksaw blades. They beat two guards and held them hostage until tear gas
quelled their escape attempt.</TE>
<TE>   After three years of appeals, Ma Duncan walked into the gas chamber
with poise and dignity--head held high, her face betraying no
emotion--but without her trademark horn-rimmed glasses. Unlike Graham,
Duncan did not ask for a blindfold. But earlier, when she had asked to be
sedated, officials had refused.</TE>
<TE>   Before the gas enveloped her, she said, "Where's Frank? I am
innocent." Frank wasn't there; he was working on getting his mother's
execution delayed. It was Aug. 8, 1962.</TE>
<TE>   Like Graham, Duncan was a woman executed with two accomplices. She
died first, and alone. Three hours later, her accomplices laughed and
talked as they strolled into the gas chamber, where they took their
seats, side by side.</TE>
<TE>   "It's down!" yelled Baldonado of the cyanide pellets; he was loud
enough to be heard through the glass partition.</TE>
<TE>   "I can smell it. It doesn't smell good," Baldonado added.</TE>
<TE>   While his mother was in prison, Frank Duncan remarried, this time to
an attorney (whom he divorced some years later).</TE>
<TE>   After his mother's execution, he moved to Los Angeles, where he
practiced law and never again made headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve women are now on death row in California.</TE>

<DH>Housing: Orange's get-tough policy focusing on code enforcement
rehabilitates deteriorated apartments for low-income tenants.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The row of concrete-block buildings known as the Esplanade Street
Apartments looked beyond salvation.</LD>
<LD>   Walls at the complex in Orange were filled with termites and bathroom
floors were almost entirely rotted out. Bedrooms were blanketed by mold
and full of the stench of sewage. A decaying swimming pool filled with
slimy water and litter sat in the middle of the beaten-down complex.</LD>
<LD>   Even police were wary of entering the place. When they investigated
possible code violations, bottles and rocks were thrown at their patrol
cars by some of the residents.</LD>
<TE>   But two years ago, when housing officials tried to buy and clean up
the apartments for low-income families, they couldn't get the owners to
sell.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would they?" said Linda Boone, economic development director for
the city. "They put all those people in each unit, charge $200 a head and
make a bundle of money."</TE>
<TE>   As many as a dozen people were crammed into each of the 27 apartments.
Some were living there in shifts. The place was a gold mine for the
landlord, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   It's a common problem in rapidly urbanizing suburbs trying to create
affordable housing for low-income workers. It's not a matter of paying
for it. The money is often there. It's about finding sites suitable for
rehabilitation in cities where no vacant land is on the market.</TE>
<TE>   A city like Orange would seem to have plenty of good candidates in its
many outdated, blighted complexes. The city has been scoping out many of
them, block by block. But owners, who could not be reached for comment,
rarely return phone calls. The city has had to turn down state housing
funds because local officials couldn't find places to put the money to
use.</TE>
<TE>   Such was the case at Esplanade. Until the city took a more aggressive
tack.</TE>
<TE>   The effort focused largely on code enforcement. A bicycle patrol was
established just to deal with the neighborhood, and code enforcement
officers with the Police Department began visiting the complex weekly.</TE>
<TE>   "It was safer on bikes because we could turn around and get out
quicker if people started throwing bottles," said Michelle Fetherolf, a
code enforcement officer.</TE>
<TE>   Violation after violation was written; the fines mounted. A thick file
of them sits in City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a tub in an upstairs apartment fall through to the floor
below," Fetherolf said.</TE>
<TE>   With the citations and fines adding up--and after the city took the
owners to court a few times--the Orange Housing Development Corp. was
able to interest the owners in opening sale negotiations in the spring of
2000. The nonprofit group was formed by the city a decade ago to handle
the creation and maintenance of affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   "The advantage of having us do this over the city is it is all we do,"
said Eunice Bobert, CEO of the nonprofit. The city helps fund the
projects, then lets Bobert's group take it from there.</TE>
<TE>   It cost $1.9 million to buy the 27 apartments on Esplanade Street.
Grant money the city had secured from Orange County covered the first
$500,000. The rest came in the form of a loan from the Orange
Redevelopment Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Another city loan of $880,000 was used to rehabilitate the complex
into a livable community.</TE>
<TE>   "They had to totally gut and redo every unit without displacing the
tenants," Boone said. The housing development corporation did, however,
eventually evict people who were not on the leases, and asked
rule-breakers to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for the poor often oppose such practices. They ask where the
families that are kicked out are supposed to go. Those involved with the
project, however, say ending the overcrowding was essential to turning
the community around.</TE>
<TE>   "These units were in such bad condition that tenants were eager for us
to get in there and fix the place up," Bobert said.</TE>
<TE>   The loans taken out to buy and repair the apartments will be repaid
through rents. All the apartments will rent for less than $850 to
low-income residents. Rents will stay at that level, adjusted for
inflation, for at least 55 years.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Gilma Aguilar, 26, moved in with her two young children
six months ago, the apartments were sparkling. The rotted swimming pool
has been replaced with a playground and laundry room, and a small lawn
and flower garden has replaced a gravel patch.</TE>
<TE>   "People said they couldn't believe I was moving to this place because
it used to be so bad," Aguilar said. "Then they came and visited me and
they were like, 'Wow, this is really nice.' "</TE>
<TE>   Last week, city officials and housing advocates dined at the complex
to celebrate its transformation into a model community.</TE>

<HD>Mexican ID Card Gains Status, and Long Lines of Applicants</HD>
<DH>Immigrants: The growing acceptance of the matricula consular by
legal authorities and businesses has more than doubled requests for them
in L.A., Santa Ana.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The matricula consular, an identification card the Mexican
government has given expatriates for more than a century, has recently
become highly sought after, with lines of applicants wrapping around city
blocks each workday at Mexican consulates in Santa Ana, Los Angeles and
elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   The soaring demand comes as the photo ID card gains standing similar
to that of the California Identification Card with some police
departments, banks and businesses in California and the Southwest.</LD>
<LD>   From the city of Orange to San Francisco, Albuquerque to Austin,
authorities began accepting them last November. Some airlines now
recognize them for flights within the United States. Other businesses are
beginning to use them for establishing store layaway plans.</LD>
<TE>   Until last fall, the Mexican Consulate in Santa Ana got 1,800 requests
a month for the card, which costs $29 and is good for five years. Now, it
handles 4,000 applications monthly. The consulate in Los Angeles used to
process 3,800 a month. Since November, that number has jumped to 10,000.</TE>
<TE>   And dozens of financial institutions courting Mexican customers--the
Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank, among them--are accepting the cards
as legal identification for opening bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually, this will be accepted throughout the United States,"
predicted Miguel Angel Isidro, head of the Mexican Consulate in Santa
Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Matriculas consulares first were issued by Mexican consulates in the
1870s to keep track of Mexicans living abroad. They later became a pseudo
passport accepted by Mexican authorities as immigrants to the United
States wanted to head back across the border.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, when proving one's identity became vital in a
security-conscious society, the matricula has become an alternative for
millions of undocumented workers not eligible for a green card or Social
Security card, who therefore could not get even a driver's license or
state-issued ID card.</TE>
<TE>   People without identification have far greater difficulty negotiating
everyday transactions such as renting videos or cashing checks. And those
stopped for routine traffic violations are more likely to be deported
because their immigration status will be investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Fear of deportation prompts people such as Angelica Mesa, a
20-year-old waitress who has lived half her life in Fullerton, to join
dozens of others lining up outside the consulate in Santa Ana on a recent
day.</TE>
<TE>   Mesa said she doesn't want to end up like her cousin, who was stopped
by Anaheim police two weeks ago for speeding. He had no driver's license
and spent four days in jail before immigration authorities determined he
was undocumented. He was then sent back to Mexico on an Immigration and
Naturalization Service bus.</TE>
<TE>   "It made me really scared," said Mesa, who graduated from Fullerton
High School two years ago. "Now I need to have something more than my
high school ID."</TE>
<TE>   Amid a sea of baby strollers and parents bundled in sweaters to ward
off the morning chill, Miguel Angel Perez agreed. He and his wife were
waiting because she has no identification, and he fears she could be
swept off the street one day.</TE>
<TE>   "After Sept. 11, anything is really possible," said Perez, a
30-year-old construction worker. "This is not an environment where you
want to be without identification. You could be deported or taken to
jail. These are tough times."</TE>
<TE>Some Critics Call ID Cards Unfair</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's Foreign Ministry has encouraged its 48 consulates in the
United States to promote acceptance of the matricula, according to Isidro
and officials at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Isidro said the Mexican government would prefer that California stop
requiring Social Security numbers to get a driver's license. In the
absence of that, matriculas are the best alternative, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What's important to us is that Mexicans are treated like everyone
else because they have identification," said Agustin Pradillo, spokesman
for the Mexican consul in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But anti-immigrant activists call the Mexican ID cards an unfair
privilege to immigrants who should not be in the United States at all.</TE>
<TE>   Groups such as the American Patrol and California Coalition for
Immigration Reform in Huntington Beach have urged their supporters to
"strongly oppose this treachery." Last month, they held what they called
defense of the homeland rallies before the Anaheim City Council to
protest the police chief's decision to recognize the Mexican ID cards.</TE>
<TE>   Even among advocates for immigrants rights, the ID cards are a source
of debate.</TE>
<TE>   Nativo Lopez, national co-director of the immigrant advocacy
organization Hermandad Mexicana, advises immigrants not to get
matriculas.</TE>
<TE>   "While we view it as a well-meaning effort by the Mexican government,
the effect is disastrous for a person who is undocumented," Lopez said.
"That's immediate evidence that [the immigrant] has no legal status. We
have proposed that the resolution is not the matricula but a [driver's]
license."</TE>
<TE>   Many who wait in line for hours to get a matricula also would prefer a
driver's license. A bill that would have allowed immigrants applying for
residency to get a California driver's license passed the Legislature but
died after Gov. Gray Davis didn't sign it into law.</TE>
<TE>   The matricula is the next best thing for those who believe proof of
identity will prevent their deportation.</TE>
<TE>   Monico Moreno, 48, has been carrying a plastic-covered miniature birth
certificate around most of his life. It shows he was born in San Antonio,
Texas. He brought his niece, a 22-year-old native of Mexico City who has
lived in the United States eight years, to the Santa Ana consulate so she
could apply for a matricula.</TE>
<TE>   "You just don't know anymore what could happen if you have no ID,"
said Moreno. "We're here because we are at war, but we should not be at
war with people who are hard-working in this country."</TE>

<HD>Ferrets Going Wild for New Project</HD>
<DH>Nature: A reintroduction of the native animals is finally bearing
dividends for biologists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TUCSON
</DL>
<LD>Richard Winstead spent weeks of tromping through grassy brush at 3
a.m., lugging a heavy backpack and shining a spotlight into the night
looking for pairs of emerald-green eyes.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, before dawn on Oct. 26, he and his colleagues at Arizona Game
and Fish spotted their quarry--little masked critters staring back at
them.</LD>
<LD>   Three wild-born black-footed ferret kits they saw that night, and
three more spotted the next night, offer hopeful signs that a
reintroduction program is working.</LD>
<TE>   "This was the first time we found a litter, so it's good news, because
we finally are showing that they are capable of surviving long enough to
have offspring," said Winstead, a state biologist. "You need that to have
a successful population."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1996, Winstead's Kingman-based team has been focused on
nurturing a captive population of ferrets to return them to the wild.</TE>
<TE>   The work is part of a broader U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service program
to reestablish one of North America's most endangered animals in a
stretch of the West encompassing Arizona, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, South
Dakota, Colorado and northwestern Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Last May, Winstead and his team released 16 ferrets, including 10
pregnant females, in the Aubrey Valley, 30,000 square acres of grasslands
and small shrubs between Peach Springs and Seligman in northwest Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The area has the state's highest density of Gunnison's prairie dogs,
the ferret's favorite prey, and the release was timed to prairie dog
birthings, Winstead said.</TE>
<TE>   Ten of the released ferrets wore radio collars, but tracking them
during the summer was unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Winstead's team also devoted 45 nights over five months last year to
spotlight patrols, driving repeatedly on routes across the Aubrey Valley
and trekking on foot through areas without roads.</TE>
<TE>   Those on foot had to carry a motorcycle battery in a backpack to power
the spotlight used to attract the ferrets' characteristic emerald-green
"eyeshine."</TE>
<TE>   Winstead described the search as "a needle-in-a-haystack sort of
situation."</TE>
<TE>   But he got lucky. The two male and four female kits were caught in
humane traps and tagged with transponders, then released. The
transponders--about the size of a grain of rice--emit an identifying
signal when a ferret is placed within inches of a magnetic reader.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the kits are believed to have been the offspring of a female
released in May.</TE>
<TE>   Other wild births have been recorded in South Dakota and Montana.</TE>
<TE>   The nocturnal black-footed ferret--the only one native to North
America--weighs about 1 1/2 pounds and is about 18 inches long. It's tan
with a brownish-black raccoon-like facemask and has black feet and a
black-tipped tail.</TE>
<TE>   The ferret spends most of its life wriggling through prairie dog
burrows. Its population shrank along with that of its prey, which falls
victim to disease, poisoning and development.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities estimate there are only 600 to 700 black-footed ferrets
today, about half living in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   Winstead said the reintroduction program will have two measures of
success: survival in the wild for a year or longer, and reproduction.</TE>
<TE>   For the Aubrey Valley, that would mean about 30 adults and their
offspring, he said. The recent discovery of young is encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   "What it means for that particular species is that we have better than
a fighting chance of getting them reestablished here, despite
unforeseeable things like disease outbreaks," said Bob Posey, Game and
Fish regional supervisor in Kingman. "We know now that they can reproduce
in the wild, and that's a major plus."</TE>

<HD>Beachside Village Proposal Rejected</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Parks Department has rejected an assemblyman's proposal
to extend the leases and raise the rents of residents at El Morro Village
to pay for restoration of the nearby historic cottage district in Crystal
Cove State Park.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) had proposed in October extending
the leases at the oceanfront village between Corona del Mar and Laguna
Beach for 10 more years while doubling the rents.</LD>
<LD>   Renovation of the historic district, considered the last intact
example of a 1920s-era Southern California beach colony, could cost as
much as $15 million, said state parks spokesman Roy Stearns.</LD>
<TE>   Campbell had said the weakened economy and cuts in Gov. Gray Davis'
budget could stall restoration of the cottages for years. He saw the
lease extension and higher rents as a way to hasten the process.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like a solution designed primarily to keep those El Morro
residents right where they are for another 10 years," Stearns said.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Areias, director of the Parks Department, said: "Extensions won
by the renters have kept them living in a state park for . . . 20 years.
How long should the public wait to watch the sunset from an El Morro
campsite?"</TE>
<TE>   Stearns added that "there are other places we can look" for funds,
including possible special legislation, the California Coastal
Conservancy "and others who have said there are money possibilities to
help."</TE>
<TE>   El Morro's 294 tenants pay $300 to $700 a month to rent their spaces
at one of Orange County's most picturesque spots.</TE>
<TE>   Other state agencies and environmentalists have lined up against
Campbell's proposal, saying all it would do is maintain public land as a
private enclave for the privileged few lucky enough to own or rent a
mobile home there.</TE>
<TE>   "The sole reason I'm doing this is to fund Crystal Cove," Campbell
said. "If we can find funding through another method, I'll drop this
proposal."</TE>
<TE>   The congressman said he has until late February before he has to
introduce any legislation.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he said, "I'm pleased that the proposal is getting
everyone to look under every rock to see where we might find money."</TE>

<LD>As an insult, being called mean may not rank with deprecations of
one's ancestry or physical appearance.</LD>
<LD>   But try to tell that to San Francisco and Santa Cruz. Officials there
felt a particular civic sting last week when two homeless advocacy groups
included them on a list of America's 12 "meanest" cities when it comes to
dealing with the down and out.</LD>
<LD>   To counteract what they see as an unwarranted slur by the National
Coalition for the Homeless and the National Law Center on Homelessness &amp;
Poverty, officials are marshaling statistics.</LD>
<TE>   In Santa Cruz, listed as the seventh-meanest, officials point out that
though the city does ticket the homeless for sleeping in parks and other
public places, the number of citations is small: about 150 last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not have a police squad looking for homeless folks," said
Assistant City Manager Martin Bernal. "The enforcement we do is strictly
based on complaints. We got more than 1,000 complaints about homeless
people last year."</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, ranked third-meanest behind New York and Atlanta,
Supervisor Gavin Newsom prepared for the coalition's annual report by
having his staff compare per capita expenditures by California counties
on general relief, a welfare program often utilized by the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Newsom's list had San Francisco at the top at $3.58 per capita, Los
Angeles second at $1.34, and Orange County at the bottom at two cents per
capita.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I completely dismiss the list as a political document more
than an objective report on San Francisco's collective consciousness on
homelessness," Newsom said. "As an elected official, I'm fed up with this
rhetoric.'</TE>
<TE>   In Salt Lake City, fourth on the list, Mayor Rocky Anderson told the
local newspaper that the list was a "slap in the face" and "based on
hearsay and double hearsay." He spoke of efforts to provide beds for the
homeless who might be attracted to the city during the upcoming Winter
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The report had particular scorn for Palm Beach County, Fla., where
police have compiled a database of homeless people, their histories and
their medical conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The practice was condemned as "chillingly Orwellian," a reference to
the novel "1984" by George Orwell. But officials in Palm Beach say their
records enable police to better deal with the homeless by knowing their
individual problems and predilections.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Whitehead, executive director of the National Coalition for the
Homeless, said he is dismayed at the hostile responses of so many
officials. "Much of the reaction has not been positive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics have questioned the methodology of the report, which
surveyed 80 communities in 37 states.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the information in the study comes from homeless activists in
those communities. Officials note that that approach can lead to a
one-sided view.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles and San Diego are criticized in the report for lacking
enough shelter beds for the homeless, but neither was listed among the 12
meanest cities. There being no scientific definition of meanness,
Whitehead concedes that the report has a degree of subjectivity.</TE>
<TE>   He said communities that are adding anti-homeless laws-including rules
against panhandling, urinating in public and sleeping in doorways-are
dinged more heavily than those that have had such ordinances on the books
for years.</TE>
<TE>   The political climate of the community is also factored in, so that an
allegedly anti-homeless attitude in liberal San Francisco is more worthy
of censure than the same attitude in conservative San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of thinking infuriates Newsom.</TE>
<TE>   "We do everything in our power to support-some say enable-services for
homeless individuals," he said. "If you're homeless in San Francisco, you
can get three meals a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. We take a
back seat to no one.'</TE>
<TE>   Whitehead responds that officials are too quick to tout their
successes, even as the number of homeless is increasing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is that as long as there is one person on the streets
without somewhere to go, you're not doing enough," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, Catholic Msgr. Joseph Carroll, who operates the St.
Vincent de Paul Center for the homeless, said quibbles over methodology
miss the point.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll has had his own disputes with the coalition over the years
about how best to help the homeless, but he supports its conclusion that
the national mood has turned cold toward the less fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's becoming very tough and very dangerous to be homeless on the
streets of America," he said.</TE>

<HD>Back From War on Terror</HD>
<DH>Military: The Carl Vinson, the first aircraft carrier to launch
airstrikes in the opening salvo, gets a hero's welcome as it arrives in
San Diego.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO
</DL>
<LD>The Carl Vinson, the first U.S. aircraft carrier to wage war on the
Al Qaeda terrorist network and its Taliban partners, arrived here
Saturday to a hero's welcome and the strains of Lee Greenwood's "God
Bless the U.S.A."</LD>
<LD>   "We were the right hand of America to get the job done," said Petty
Officer 3rd Class Juan Pineda, 22, of Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   "It feels good," said Petty Officer 3rd Class Bridgette Shryock, 23,
of Chicago. "My parents are proud."</LD>
<TE>   The tale of the Vinson's role in the war in Afghanistan is in the
numbers: 4,200 combat sorties, 2 million pounds of ordnance dropped,
16,152 launches and retrievals of aircraft, 111 days of operations, and
only four "down" days for maintenance of its 70-plus warplanes.</TE>
<TE>   Other carriers have also played key roles-Theodore Roosevelt, Kitty
Hawk, Enterprise and John C. Stennis--but none can claim the numbers of
the Vinson or the designation of having launched the first airstrikes in
the opening U.S. salvo of the war on Oct. 7.</TE>
<TE>   The Vinson was in the first weeks of a planned six-month deployment
enforcing the "no-fly" zone in Iraq when terrorists struck the U.S. on
Sept. 11. By Oct. 7, the carrier and several of its supporting ships were
within striking distance of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We were there when everybody else was trying to get there," said
Command Master Chief Mike Williams, 42, of Lawrence, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   By any measure, the war numbers are impressive-18 million gallons of
jet fuel used, 1,421 briefings by meteorologists about weather
conditions, 37 underway replenishment operations (no time to go to port
for more bombs or beans), and no major injuries or aircraft accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The truism about an aircraft carrier is that it's a floating city, and
there are numbers to support that: 1.4 million e-mails sent by sailors,
2.1 million e-mails received by sailors, 53 surgeries performed by the
ship's doctors, 535 pairs of glasses made by the optometrists and 839
teeth pulled by the dentists.</TE>
<TE>   There is another number, too: 76, the number of babies born to the
wives of crew members while the ship was gone.</TE>
<TE>   As the Vinson docked at North Island Naval Air Station in Coronado,
fathers with babies they had not yet seen were given priority in the
lengthy process of disembarking 5,000 sailors and several hundred
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   And so Michael Floyd, 24, who repairs electrical systems on the
warplanes, was able to rush to meet his wife, Jennifer, 19, and hold
their month-old son, Michael Sean, for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so glad I was able to be part of what the Vinson did," said
Floyd, cradling the infant. "Maybe we made the world a little bit safer
for my son."</TE>
<TE>   After being relieved by the Stennis on Dec. 16, the Vinson made port
visits in Singapore and then Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where several hundred
family members joined for the ride to San Diego. After unloading aircraft
equipment and more than 1,000 sailors, the ship will leave today for
Bremerton, Wash., its home port.</TE>
<TE>   As the carrier rounded Point Loma, an eerie calm prevailed. The flight
deck, normally crowded with aircraft and the deafening roar of their
engines, was quiet. The aircraft-from Whidbey Island, Wash.; Oceana, Va.;
Lemoore Naval Air Station in Central California; North Island; and Marine
Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego-had departed Thursday and Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We serve the country, that's what we do," said Petty Officer 3rd
Class Marlon Deguzman, 23, of San Diego. Just as he said it, the skyline
of the Navy's West Coast home came into view, prompting shouts and whoops
of excitement from the 1,500 sailors assigned to man the rails.</TE>
<TE>   But even amid the joy, there was talk that the war is not yet over.
Senior officials have warned that military action may be needed in other
countries to root out Al Qaeda and its protectors and sympathizers.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope we get to be there when Al Qaeda is dismantled," said
Command Master Chief Odie Cook, 43, of Tucson. "We were there at the
beginning, we should be there at the end."</TE>

<HD>Officials Can't See the Forest for the Trees, Critics Say</HD>
<DH>Environment: Activists accuse Forest Service of exaggerating fire
damage to expand logging. Agency says it's just removing fuel for future
wildfires.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SONNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>RENO
</DL>
<LD>The Forest Service has suspended plans for salvage logging of
fire-killed trees in the Sierra after an appeal by environmentalists who
say the agency is exploiting loopholes to clear-cut healthy old-growth
forests.</LD>
<LD>   Forest Service officials expect most of the salvage operation to
resume in two national forests northwest of Lake Tahoe, part of the
ongoing effort throughout the West to remove dead timber to reduce future
fire threats.</LD>
<LD>   They say the appeal was granted to gather more information on the
effect on the California spotted owl, not because of violations of
federal forest protection measures.</LD>
<TE>   Opponents say the Forest Service got caught.</TE>
<TE>   They say the agency is exaggerating fire damage estimates in the
forests along the Pacific Crest Trail to dodge environmental restrictions
so it can harvest more so-called dead and dying trees--some more than 200
years old and larger than 3 feet in diameter.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very high-quality, old-growth forest, nesting habitat for
the California spotted owl, and they are talking about virtually
clear-cutting it under the guise of salvaging fire-scorched trees," said
Chad Hanson of Grass Valley, Calif., director of the John Muir Project,
an affiliate of the Earth Island Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson and others challenging the logging say the Storrie fire that
burned two summers ago through the rugged mountains of the Plumas and
Lassen national forests caused far less damage than the Forest Service
claims.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these trees are not dead," Hanson said. "Many are not even
visibly burned."</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service officials have heard the charges before. They say they
are confident of their assessments as well as their belief that the
forest will benefit if some of the trees are cut, about 70 million board
feet's worth--enough lumber to build 7,000 typical three-bedroom homes.</TE>
<TE>   "It is restoration work. There is no guise to it," said Ed Cole,
supervisor of the Lassen National Forest, where most of the Storrie fire
salvage project is planned.</TE>
<TE>   "People are painting a picture like we are denuding the forest. It was
a 45,000-acre fire and we are only looking at a project area of about
3,500 acres. And it's not like we are removing every tree from those
3,500 acres," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the disagreement centers on the difficulty of determining when
a tree is dead.</TE>
<TE>   "You can have a green tree standing out there that is a dead tree,"
Cole said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the Forest Service is using faulty standards to gauge
the scorching of tree crowns, the damage to the tree's inner skin known
as the cambium and the extent to which those calculations relate to
whether a tree is really dead.</TE>
<TE>   "These trees have survived many, many scorchings over their life. They
have very thick bark. To say they only look alive, they are really dead,
is absolutely ridiculous," Hanson said.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute is part of a larger debate that has raged for years over
whether logging helps or hurts a forest after wildfires or insect
infestations. Scientists have argued before Congress on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists argue that if the Forest Service was true to its
claim that the health of the forest is the priority, it should wait a few
years to see if the scorched trees die.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the rush?" Hanson asked.</TE>
<TE>   But agency officials and leaders of the timber industry counter that
the wood will rot, lose its market value and add to the buildup of fuels
that stoke future fires.</TE>
<TE>   "The commercial logging aspect of it is one way to remove the fuel
from these acres where somebody actually pays the federal government to
do it," Cole said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't remove it this way, sooner or later it will be removed
at taxpayer expense. We'll have to pay hard money to haul the stuff, pile
it and burn it.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now we have a commercially viable project, but we are into the
second year, and deterioration comes on pretty fast in the second year,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   An increasing percentage of the Forest Service's timber operation has
been in salvage operations during the last decade, while the logging of
green trees has declined dramatically, from about 12 billion board feet
nationally in 1990 to about 2 billion board feet last year.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson, a native of Glendale, said he first became concerned when he
observed logging operations while hiking the Pacific Coast Trail from
Mexico to Canada in 1989. Upon graduation from law school at the
University of Oregon in 1992, he filed a lawsuit challenging salvage
logging plans there.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was nullified when President Clinton signed a salvage logging
measure that exempted the harvests from existing environmental laws.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been involved on the policy side ever since," said Hanson, who
contends that salvage logging actually increases fire risks by removing
large trees that provide shade and store water.</TE>
<TE>   "The Forest Service is trying to get the vast majority of its logging
projects out everywhere through post-fire salvage sales," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, any time a fire burns the Forest Service goes in and says,
'The entire area has been incinerated and there is no more habitat for
things like spotted owls or the Pacific fisher and so we can log . . .
it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Phil Aune, a vice president of the industry's California Forestry
Assn. who worked 35 years for the Forest Service, accused Hanson and
others of abusing the appeal process to delay salvage projects.</TE>
<TE>   "The tactic is the same with every major wildfire across the western
United States--delay long enough so the economic value goes away," said
Aune, former director of forest management and research at an agency lab
in Redding.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it quite ironic that if you remove just one tree by harvesting
they say you will have a great effect on the California spotted owl, but
if hundreds of trees are killed by a fire, it can still be considered
California spotted owl habitat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Forest Service's regional office granted the
environmentalists' appeal, a spokesman said officials there share Cole's
belief that the majority of the proposed salvage operation will go
forward.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't feel there are large deficiencies" in the initial project
that was rejected, spokesman Mark Mathes said. "The regional office does
feel that trees need to be cut in these areas. We'd just like to see a
little more analysis done."</TE>
<TE>   Cole expects the revised environmental assessment to be completed by
the end of the month and a decision issued in February, also subject to
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists warn that the agency could be in for a court battle.</TE>
<TE>   "There will have to be a dramatic reduction in the logging levels,"
Hanson said. "If they are going to break the law, we will sue them."</TE>

<HD>Logging Science Debate Smolders in the Sierra</HD>
<DH>Nature: Federal officials and environmentalists disagree on how to
tell if a tree will die. Issue is central to defining boundaries of
harvest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SONNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>RENO
</DL>
<LD>Political and scientific angst over forest health, wildfire threats
and the effect of salvaging dead trees is spurring new debate in the
Sierra over a seemingly simple question: When is a tree dead?</LD>
<LD>   Stricter federal standards recently adopted for more than 11 million
acres of national forests in California require loggers to leave behind
many of the biggest green trees and some dead ones to help forests
regenerate.</LD>
<LD>   But the rules waive some protections when wildfires kill 75% to 80% of
the trees in an area.</LD>
<TE>   Environmentalists who have blocked a proposed salvage logging
operation near Storrie, Calif., accuse the Forest Service of exaggerating
the number of trees killed in a 45,000-acre fire there two years ago.
They say the standards are rigged to count many living trees as dead.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the agency is wrong to conclude that a tree qualifies as
dead if 65% of its crown is scorched. They say many pines and firs
survive 80% to 90% scorching, and some independent scientists agree.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service officials admit that estimating the probability a tree
will die is an inexact science. But they are confident about the
standards used in the Storrie fire area, 80 miles west of Reno near Lake
Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we have 75% mortality. Some of these trees have green
needles, but they are dead," said Ed Cole, Forest Service supervisor for
the Lassen National Forest, where the bulk of the salvage project is
planned.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service officials say more important than the condition of the
crown is the inner skin, the cambium, which works as a tree's circulatory
system.</TE>
<TE>   "You can fry the cambium and not even scorch the canopy and if the
cambium is fried, the tree is dead," Cole said.</TE>
<TE>   "It may not happen overnight," Forest Service regional spokesman Matt
Mathes said, "but the tree will die."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists accuse the agency of exploiting the exemptions to
remove more than dead trees.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't say 'dying.' It's trees that are actually killed--not 'may
die,' not 'dying,' but dead," said Chad Hanson of Grass Valley, Calif.,
director of the John Muir Project, one of the groups that won an appeal
temporarily blocking the salvage project because the effect on the
California spotted owl wasn't fully documented.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists say many variables determine whether a burned or damaged
tree will die, from crown survival, cambial condition and root
regeneration to climate, geography and the species of tree.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a judgment call," said Bob Wood, an entomologist at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides can argue for a long time about what is going to live or
die based on various thresholds. I'm sure that many trees with 65% crown
scorch die, but many don't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The mortality standards at the 2000 Storrie fire were written in
November by Sheri Smith, the Forest Service's supervising entomologist
for northeastern California.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said she began research 13 years ago out of concern that the
agency's 4-decade-old standards--primarily 50% crown scorching--meant too
many live trees were being given up for dead.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the same concerns that Mr. Hanson has--I don't want to see
trees cut that aren't going to die. But what I want to do is provide the
best scientific data for basing decisions," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the one who is going to get called into court for the deposition,
and I'm going to be the one the judge asks what kind of data we have."</TE>
<TE>   The 65% standard is based on more recent research with pine trees
dating to 1994, including some in the Lake Tahoe region, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone agrees.</TE>
<TE>   David Peterson, research scientist with the Forest Service Pacific
Northwest Research Station in Seattle, said fire-resistant species like
Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir "can tolerate 80% to 90% crown scorch and
generally will survive if not injured at the base.</TE>
<TE>   "All other things being equal, for fire-resistant trees 65% is a
little on the low side," said Peterson, also a professor at the
University of Washington.</TE>

<HD>Program Provides the First Lesson in Proper Behavior</HD>
<DH>Education: The Skills for Life curriculum used by a Ventura
elementary school aims to curb violence by teaching students self-control
and respect.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The second-graders in Hadley Rick's class at E.P. Foster Elementary
School stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes fixed forward.</LD>
<LD>   Gradually, bubbles begin to dance across the room, just centimeters
from their faces. The glistening, soapy spheres beg to be popped, but the
children allow them to float to the floor.</LD>
<LD>   "Look at that self-control!" exclaims Jon Oliver, director of the
Massachusetts-based Lesson One Foundation, during a recent visit to the
Ventura school. "That's the same self-control you would use if a bully
comes by, or if someone tries to give you drugs or alcohol."</LD>
<TE>   The exercise is part of Oliver's Skills for Life program, a curriculum
that aims to prevent school violence by teaching kids in kindergarten
through fifth grade how to control themselves, respect others and avoid
violent behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Oliver's program--what he calls "the ABCs of life"--has been used on
the East Coast for nearly 30 years. Demand for it elsewhere has soared in
recent years, particularly after shootings at Columbine High School in
Colorado and Santana High School near San Diego put a national spotlight
on campus safety.</TE>
<TE>   E.P. Foster, in a Ventura neighborhood plagued for years by gangs, is
the first school in California to fully implement the program, Oliver
said.</TE>
<TE>   "What a gift to give these children, with all the turmoil in their
lives," Principal Michael Babb said. "We're sending these kids out into
the future with these skills, and they're going to need them."</TE>
<TE>   Skills for Life is based on a "Pledge for Success" that children and
teachers recite each day. It includes promises to wait their turn to
speak, to always try their best and to treat others the way they want to
be treated.</TE>
<TE>Games Help Make Abstract Concepts Real</TE>
<TE>   The curriculum employs often-repeated phrases such as "use your
self-control," "take responsibility" and "celebrate diversity." Games and
simple stories help make the abstract concepts real.</TE>
<TE>   In Rick's class last week, Oliver sat at the front of the room with a
cylinder filled with colorful rocks. Moving it back and forth, he asked
the students to close their eyes and think about what it sounded like.</TE>
<TE>   "A strong rainstorm," said one student.</TE>
<TE>   "Making popcorn," offered another.</TE>
<TE>   "A waterfall!" piped another.</TE>
<TE>   The exercise is teaching kids that different people perceive things
differently, Oliver said, and that they should celebrate that diversity.
It also gives them problem-solving skills, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of feeling stuck, you can think of all the different answers
there might be to one question," he told them.</TE>
<TE>   At E.P. Foster, Lesson One has become part of the school's culture.
All teachers require students to take "self-control time"--in which
everyone sits still, breathing deeply with eyes closed for three
minutes--three times a day. And the vocabulary is used constantly by
teachers, administrators and students.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at E.P. Foster found out about the program two years ago
from a volunteer who had seen a presentation at a violence-prevention
seminar.</TE>
<TE>   Training and materials are funded mostly through grants obtained by
the school or through the nonprofit Lesson One Foundation, Oliver said.</TE>
<TE>   Since E.P. Foster started using the curriculum, officials say they
have witnessed a turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer students are being sent to the principal's office for
discipline. Spats on the playground are less frequent. Educators are
spending less time trying to control their classes and more time
teaching.</TE>
<TE>   Logan Culp, who teaches fifth grade at the school, said there has been
a marked improvement in his students' behavior this year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fifth-grade class that was pretty much well-known as
fourth-graders for being difficult," Culp said. "It's pretty amazing."</TE>
<TE>   After Oliver's visit last week, Culp's students talked about how the
program has helped them.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I want to give up on stuff, but it helps to know I just
have to try my best," said Kyle O'Kelley, 10.</TE>
<TE>   "In fourth grade I used to call people names," said Savannah
Hottinger, 11. "I don't think I'd like to be treated that way."</TE>
<TE>   Parents said the classroom lessons have also found their way into the
home. Darcy Mendelson said that when her son, Michael, gets worked up and
frustrated, she asks him to take "self-control time."</TE>
<TE>   "He'll start the breathing, and then slowly the tears stop and he
calms down. Once he's calmed down, we can talk about why he's upset," she
said. "It's a miraculous thing."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Till now, I've been undecided on what position to take in the
debate over the sheriff's retirement plan, especially since I have a
friend who is a retired deputy.</LD>
<LD>   A letter in the Ventura County section Jan. 13 by Randy Workman was
the clincher for me. I applaud him for the courage to write, I believe,
what most people think but are reluctant to say. He convinced me with his
letter.</LD>
<LD>   I especially liked when he wrote, "If they threaten to strike or walk
out, replace them like President Reagan did to the air traffic
controllers."</LD>
<TE>   I recall that the system worked just as well (if not better)
afterward. Again, though I don't know you, thanks, Randy, for saying what
is, it seems, politically incorrect and for having the courage to do so.</TE>

<HD>Candidates and Callahan Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Editor's Note: In a Jan. 6 article in The Times, district attorney
candidates Ron Bamieh and Greg Totten were questioned about a case in
which a crime witness, Bridget Callahan, thought she had been promised
immunity for her testimony but is now being prosecuted for murder. In the
interview, Totten said he was "not directly involved in that case and had
no significant decision-making role."</LD>
<LD>   I have recently read the comments from Mr. Totten regarding the
Bridget Callahan case. Mr. Totten supporting the confessed killer of my
daughter angers me greatly. I am asking him now publicly to stop
jeopardizing my daughter's killer's case for political purposes. Mr.
Totten knows that the killers of my daughter would never have been caught
without the efforts of Ron Bamieh.</LD>
<LD>   Mr. Totten also knows the truth about the actions of Mr. Bamieh in
this case and knows there is no merit to the defense attorney's claims
[of prosecutorial misconduct]. Mr. Totten himself approved of Mr.
Bamieh's actions prior to the grand jury, and he was well aware of all of
the issues in this case in August 2000. He remained silent then, but now
Mr. Totten's desperate attempt to become district attorney has led to him
trying to gain some political advantage with this case. Mr. Totten is now
playing the role of politician, not prosecutor. A real prosecutor would
never do this. The people of this county should pay attention to this
type of behavior.</LD>
<TE>   I know Ron Bamieh as the prosecutor who helped lead the effort to
bring the killers of my daughter to justice. He, along with an
investigator with the district attorney's office and some innovative
investigators of the Sheriff's Department, worked tirelessly to take
these killers off the street. Mr. Bamieh's dedication in bringing my
daughter's killers to justice has given me hope that the criminal justice
system can work.</TE>
<TE>   I am well aware of the facts and circumstances of the case against Ms.
Callahan. I know she confessed her involvement in my daughter's murder,
and I also know that everything Ron Bamieh and the investigators in the
case did to bring her to justice was legal and ethical. I am grateful for
his efforts and know that without them my daughter's killers may have
been free to kill another mother's child.</TE>
<TE>   The next district attorney should be a proven crime-fighter and
supporter of victims. I know who Ron Bamieh is. What are you, Mr. Totten?
Your recent comments in the paper suggest that you are more comfortable
supporting criminals than you are supporting victims and fighting crime.
Mr. Totten, you should be running for public defender, not district
attorney.</TE>

<HD>Tax Collector Policies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The treasurer-tax collector's office has recently received
increased interest in our bankruptcy claims practices. Lurid headlines
have suggested that funds may have been lost, leading some folks to
believe that our policies and practices have caused harm to the county's
financial situation. The facts show that this is decidedly untrue.</LD>
<LD>   Our office is charged with collecting close to $900 million in various
types of taxes. Almost $700 million of this is in the form of secured
taxes, so we are geared up to place most, but not all, of our focus on
collecting the secured roll. Our efforts have resulted in a consistently
high collection rate for current secured taxes. Last year the collection
rate was 97%, which ranked us as one of the most productive offices in
the state. However, as has been pointed out, there was a part of our
operation, namely bankruptcy collections, where we were not as
productive.</LD>
<LD>   Following the late 2000 retirement of a staff member, the early 2001
medical leave taken by another key person and vacancies caused by
promotions, we were left with the challenge of assigning priorities to
the various duties and tasks. We did not have enough people on hand to do
each of our regular tasks at the same level that had previously been
possible.</LD>
<TE>   The natural question, then, is why did we decide to de-emphasize
bankruptcy? We see bankruptcy collections as being important but when
compared to other things we do, like processing refunds, collecting and
accounting for current collections and fielding taxpayer questions, we
felt the priority should be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   I've had people in business tell me that they don't see much value in
filing bankruptcy claims. Their perspective is that it doesn't usually
pay off to use hard-earned money to go after a person or business that is
in such a tough financial situation that they've filed for bankruptcy.
One person told me that often the claims are not worth the postage used
in mailing them. I think government leaders need to pay more attention to
the things that business uses in making financial decisions. This is
particularly true with our bankruptcy cases because we are finding that
the secured taxes (things like land, houses, and office buildings) are
eventually paid, whether or not we file a claim.</TE>
<TE>   The claims that represent our greatest vulnerability in bankruptcy
cases are unsecured taxes. This tax type covers boats, airplanes and
business equipment. Compared with the secured roll properties, the
individual unsecured tax bills are small, commonly less than $500. In the
two years before we made the change in covering bankruptcy claims, our
average annual unsecured collections received directly through the
bankruptcy desk was less than $5,000. In the year with incomplete
coverage of this operation, we still collected around $2,100. Thus, we
might have received $3,000 less, but we did so while getting the benefit
of salary savings of approximately $15,000. In addition, we were able to
put our limited resources to work on more productive work. I am
satisfied, in retrospect, that we made the right decision.</TE>
<TE>   Let me address one final point of the article. The instructions given
to staff back in February 2001 were to de-emphasize bankruptcy claim
filings. They were told that, so far as possible, we should still try to
get a few filed each month. It turns out that for several months they
were not even able to do a few.</TE>
<TE>   In tracking the many areas within my responsibilities as treasurer-tax
collector and public administrator, and understanding the small scope of
the unsecured bankruptcy work, I had little reason to closely track the
claims-filing activity. When we later looked at the 2001 filing history,
it was clear that staff hadn't been able to pull away from the other
duties to file bankruptcy claims. I must stress, however, that the best
facts we have available show that there has been no public harm caused by
not filing these claims.</TE>

<HD>Totten's Experience</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The people of Ventura County will choose either Greg Totten or Ron
Bamieh to succeed Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury on March 5. After
moderating a meeting where they both spoke and reading the Jan. 11
article on this race in The Times, I have concluded that Greg Totten
should be elected as our next district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Greg, 47, has been through the chairs over the past 20 years. He is
now chief assistant district attorney--second in command. Ron, 35,
graduated from law school in 1991 and has been on the staff for nine
years.</LD>
<LD>   Clearly, Totten has the experience needed to assume responsibility for
an office of about 600 people and a budget of $40 million. The D.A. is
one of the most important managers in our government.</LD>
<TE>   As your headline said, "Bamieh Far Ahead in D.A. Funds Race." You
report that Bamieh's father, Sam Bamieh, has donated $239,000 toward
Ron's campaign so far. Sam, a major GOP contributor, has been quoted as
saying, "If I can give the Republican Party $500,000, I can give my son
$10 million to win this race." You also report that Totten has raised
$175,100, mostly through small donations from local attorneys, ranchers,
educators and business leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh criticized Totten for taking numerous donations from people who
could seek favors from the district attorney's office. "I would say that
there is one candidate in this race who is independent," Bamieh said.
Independent? The Times reports "his war chest has largely been bankrolled
by his father." A candidate largely financed by a single political
operative, even if he is his father, is anything but independent.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Bradbury has been a great district attorney. He is effective,
knowledgeable and respected. His shoes will be difficult to fill. Even
so, many feel that he has been too partisan. Do we want to replace him
with a man whose dad, mentor and financial supporter is a major
Republican fund-raiser? Do we want to elect a man who is raising other
money from a list of national GOP political figures from outside
California?</TE>
<TE>   It appears that Bamieh is attempting to launch a political career. His
dad is spending too much to simply put him in the district attorney's
chair.</TE>
<TE>   Totten promises change and improvement in the office. He is supported
by Bradbury, but he is his own man. He is not Michael Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   Watch for a meeting where both candidates will appear. Hear them out.
Check on the above statements by The Times and by me. I believe you will
join me in supporting Greg Totten.</TE>

<HD>Women Out of Their Depth?</HD>
<DH>Australian Open: Top players make it look too easy, and make Rios'
criticism look valid, in fourth-round victories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia
</DL>
<LD>Who thought that Marcelo Rios would be so prescient?</LD>
<LD>   After all, Rios is a Chilean tennis player, not an oracle. Less than a
day after Rios smacked women's tennis as lacking depth, he sounded
reasonable instead of rash.</LD>
<LD>   The evidence mounted early today, accumulated and, by the time
third-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland had barely sweated through a
6-1, 6-0 victory against No. 15 Amanda Coetzer of South Africa, the
defense disappeared.</LD>
<TE>   Game, set and match, Rios. At least for today.</TE>
<TE>   In other fourth-round matches, second-seeded Venus Williams needed 48
minutes to dismiss No. 13 Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria, 6-0, 6-3. Hingis
took the first set and led, 1-0, in the second within half an hour,
ultimately finishing in 44 minutes. Unheralded Adriana Serra Zanetti of
Italy took the longest, beating Martina Sucha of Slovakia, 6-1, 7-5, in
61 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Seles advanced after just 33 minutes but that was because her
Spanish opponent, Anabel Medina Garrigues, retired after injuring her
right knee in yet another scary-looking crash on the sticky Rebound Ace
surface.</TE>
<TE>   Down, 2-4, she attempted to play after receiving treatment but lasted
only two more points and left the court in tears, saying, "Why?" Medina
Garrigues was taken to a hospital for additional testing. No immediate
report on her injury was available, according to the WTA.</TE>
<TE>   Seles looked rattled, hesitant to try to hit a winner, when her
opponent tried to resume competing for the final two points. She will
meet Williams in the quarterfinals, and was asked about Rios' recent
remarks. "I'm not even going to comment on that," Seles said. "I'm not
going to even give him an answer back on that."</TE>
<TE>   Williams responded to Rios by saying: "I enjoy the women's game. We're
here because we deserve it.... We just don't bring our best games to
Slams, we bring it to every event."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hingis: "I think if [Rios] played with me, he'd change his mind."</TE>
<TE>   One of Rios' colleagues, Stefan Koubek of Austria, supported him.
Koubek, who defeated qualifier Fernando Gonzalez of Chile, 7-5, 6-1, 6-7
(3), 6-2, reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam for the first time in
his career.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, if you look at the draw, I mean there's the men fighting for
two, three hours every match," Koubek said. "And then there's the women
playing 40 minutes. That says everything, and I think Rios was not that
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Koubek joined Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic and Jonas Bjorkman of
Sweden in the quarterfinals. Bjorkman produced the shock result today,
dispatching No. 6 Tim Henman of Great Britain, 6-2, 7-6 (6), 6-4. Henman
had been the highest-seeded player remaining and the British bandwagon
was starting to become standing room only.</TE>
<TE>   Said Henman: "I certainly had high expectations, why wouldn't I? I did
well in Adelaide and backed it up so far in the first three rounds. I
certainly don't have any right to win the match. I've got to go out there
and prove it and I didn't do that today."</TE>
<TE>   Bjorkman, 29, had not reached a Grand Slam quarterfinal since the U.S.
Open in 1998, and the Swede has found singles success somewhat elusive
despite superb doubles results.</TE>
<TE>   He has lost to Henman just twice in seven matches, though, managing to
beat him at his own serve-and-volley game, showing excellent court
coverage and exquisite touch.</TE>
<TE>   He made two highlight-type shots in the second-set tiebreaker.
Trailing, 5-6, Bjorkman flicked a crosscourt passing shot off a Henman
volley. At 6-6, he retrieved a Henman overhead and smacked it back for a
winner off his own overhead.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I should have a chance to get on CNN with that play of the
day," he said. "I probably haven't done that for many years."</TE>

<HD>Homicides Increase in the Nation's Safest Big City</HD>
<DH>Simi Valley: Crime rose 1.8% in 2001 over the previous year, with a
disturbing hike in violent incidents. But the rate is still well below
the 1992 peak.</DH>

<LD>The nation's safest large city became a little less secure last
year as suburban Simi Valley suffered a string of high-profile homicides,
and a 30-year-old handyman was charged as the serial rapist who
terrorized local women and then killed a college student in a freeway
assault.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a tough and unusual year," Police Chief Randy Adams said. "We
had more homicides and tragic events in six months than we'd had in three
or four years."</LD>
<LD>   Ranked as America's safest city with at least 100,000 residents, Simi
Valley saw crime tick upward 1.8% in 2001 from the previous year as
incidents of violence jumped nearly 10%.</LD>
<TE>   Police reported 1,736 serious crimes last year, down from 3,556 at the
peak in 1992. The city's crime rate is still nearly the lowest in the
31-year history of its Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, 2001 was a year to forget.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic violence haunted the city, a popular hometown for law
enforcement officers. Its six homicides were the most since 1991. That
isn't counting the two children who died of excessive heat when their
inebriated mother left them strapped in the family van while she slept
inside their home. She pleaded guilty to felony child endangerment.</TE>
<TE>   The first homicide occurred in June, when an off-duty Los Angeles
police officer fatally shot his ex-girlfriend's boyfriend in front of the
victim's home, then killed himself.</TE>
<TE>   In September, a Thousand Oaks man who had dated a Simi Valley woman
invaded her home and methodically shot five family members, killing a
grandmother and two children before fleeing to Los Padres National
Forest, where he took his own life.</TE>
<TE>   In October, a Los Angeles County firefighter admitted fatally shooting
his step-son's father after the two men argued about a child custody
issue. He alleged self-defense and has not been charged. The same month,
an 18-year-old man was charged with stabbing a Simi Valley carpenter to
death at a birthday party.</TE>
<TE>   "The positive is that everybody responsible for these acts is either
in custody or took their own life," Adams said. "So we don't have anybody
out there preying upon the city."</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore, anyway, since the so-called "Simi Valley rapist," a
jobless handyman named Vincent Sanchez, has been charged with sexually
assaulting or attempting to assault 14 women beginning in 1996 and ending
just days before his arrest in July. He has pleaded guilty to most of the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez has also admitted slaying 20-year-old Moorpark College student
Megan Barroso, whom authorities say he attempted to rape three weeks
before a Simi Valley roommate turned him in as a suspect in the previous
rapes.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd spent thousands of hours to break that case," Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with that success, 2001 was a downer overall. In addition to
murder, felony assaults were up sharply and auto thefts soared 55%. With
drops in robbery, rape, burglary, theft and arson, the city had 31 more
major crimes than last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, I would say the difference is not significant," Adams said.
"We would certainly like to see a decrease, but we are proud of the
diligence of our officers and the partnership of our citizens in keeping
this a safe city."</TE>
<TE>   Adams said his city's success in the long run--a 51% drop in crime
since 1992--can be attributed to the aggressiveness of patrol officers
who regularly catch criminals in the act.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the luxury of being in a city where our guys don't have to
run from call to call," he said. "So they're out there digging and
scratching to follow undiscovered crime."</TE>
<TE>   In the last week, Adams said, officers caught a thief--hours after he
robbed a liquor store--as he was burglarizing a car in an apartment
carport. They apprehended four men accused of raping a young woman by
spotting their car shortly after the incident. And they stopped a stolen
car before the thief could take it out of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The message to criminals is if they're going to do that activity,
they better not do it here," Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   Car thieves apparently didn't get the message last year, as heists
increased from 124 to 192. But Adams noted that the 2001 number is close
to the norm in Simi Valley's recent history and a fraction of the 445
total in 1992.</TE>
